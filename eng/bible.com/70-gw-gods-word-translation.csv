GEN.1.1	 In the beginning God created heaven and earth.
GEN.1.2	 The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep water. The Spirit of God was hovering over the water.
GEN.1.3	 Then God said, “Let there be light!” So there was light. 
GEN.1.4	 God saw the light was good. So God separated the light from the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	 God named the light 
GEN.1.6	 Then God said, “Let there be a horizon in the middle of the water in order to separate the water.” 
GEN.1.7	 So God made the horizon and separated the water above and below the horizon. And so it was. 
GEN.1.8	 God named ⌊what was above⌋ the horizon 
GEN.1.9	 Then God said, “Let the water under the sky come together in one area, and let the dry land appear.” And so it was. 
GEN.1.10	 God named the dry land 
GEN.1.11	 Then God said, “Let the earth produce vegetation: plants bearing seeds, each according to its own type, and fruit trees bearing fruit with seeds, each according to its own type.” And so it was. 
GEN.1.12	 The earth produced vegetation: plants bearing seeds, each according to its own type, and trees bearing fruit with seeds, each according to its own type. God saw that they were good. 
GEN.1.13	 There was evening, then morning—a third day.
GEN.1.14	 Then God said, “Let there be lights in the sky to separate the day from the night. They will be signs and will mark religious festivals, days, and years. 
GEN.1.15	 They will be lights in the sky to shine on the earth.” And so it was. 
GEN.1.16	 God made the two bright lights: the larger light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night. He also made the stars. 
GEN.1.17	 God put them in the sky to give light to the earth, 
GEN.1.18	 to dominate the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.19	 There was evening, then morning—a fourth day.
GEN.1.20	 Then God said, “Let the water swarm with swimming creatures, and let birds fly through the sky over the earth.” 
GEN.1.21	 So God created the large sea creatures, every type of creature that swims around in the water and every type of flying bird. God saw that they were good. 
GEN.1.22	 God blessed them and said, “Be fertile, increase in number, fill the sea, and let there be many birds on the earth.” 
GEN.1.23	 There was evening, then morning—a fifth day.
GEN.1.24	 Then God said, “Let the earth produce every type of living creature: every type of domestic animal, crawling animal, and wild animal.” And so it was. 
GEN.1.25	 God made every type of wild animal, every type of domestic animal, and every type of creature that crawls on the ground. God saw that they were good.
GEN.1.26	 Then God said, “Let us make humans in our image, in our likeness. Let them rule the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the domestic animals all over the earth, and all the animals that crawl on the earth.”
GEN.1.27	 So God created humans in his image.
GEN.1.27	In the image of God he created them.
GEN.1.27	He created them male and female.
GEN.1.28	 God blessed them and said, “Be fertile, increase in number, fill the earth, and be its master. Rule the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that crawl on the earth.”
GEN.1.29	 God said, “I have given you every plant with seeds on the face of the earth and every tree that has fruit with seeds. This will be your food. 
GEN.1.30	 I have given all green plants as food to every land animal, every bird in the sky, and every animal that crawls on the earth—every living, breathing animal.” And so it was.
GEN.1.31	 And God saw everything that he had made and that it was very good. There was evening, then morning—the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	 Heaven and earth and everything in them were finished. 
GEN.2.2	 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing. On the seventh day he stopped the work he had been doing. 
GEN.2.3	 Then God blessed the seventh day and set it apart as holy, because on that day he stopped all his work of creation.
GEN.2.4	 This is the account of heaven and earth when they were created, at the time when the L
GEN.2.5	 Wild bushes and plants were not on the earth yet because the L
GEN.2.6	 Instead, underground water would come up from the earth and water the entire surface of the ground.
GEN.2.7	 Then the L

GEN.2.10	 A river flowed from Eden to water the garden. Outside the garden it divided into four rivers. 
GEN.2.11	 The name of the first river is Pishon. This is the one that winds throughout Havilah, where there is gold. 
GEN.2.12	 (The gold of that land is pure. Bdellium 
GEN.2.13	 The name of the second river is Gihon. This is the one that winds throughout Sudan. 
GEN.2.14	 The name of the third river is Tigris. This is the one that flows east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.

GEN.2.18	 Then the L
GEN.2.19	 The L
GEN.2.20	 So the man named all the domestic animals, all the birds, and all the wild animals.
GEN.2.20	But the man found no helper who was right for him. 
GEN.2.21	 So the L
GEN.2.22	 Then the L
GEN.2.23	 The man said,
GEN.2.23	“This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
GEN.2.23	She will be named 
GEN.2.23	because she was taken from man.”
GEN.2.24	 That is why a man will leave his father and mother and will be united with his wife, and they will become one flesh. 
GEN.2.25	 The man and his wife were both naked, but they weren’t ashamed of it.
GEN.3.1	 The snake was more clever than all the wild animals the L
GEN.3.2	 The woman answered the snake, “We’re allowed to eat the fruit from any tree in the garden 
GEN.3.3	 except the tree in the middle of the garden. God said, ‘You must never eat it or touch it. If you do, you will die!’ ”
GEN.3.4	 “You certainly won’t die!” the snake told the woman. 
GEN.3.5	 “God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened. You’ll be like God, knowing good and evil.”
GEN.3.6	 The woman saw that the tree had fruit that was good to eat, nice to look at, and desirable for making someone wise. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.
GEN.3.7	 Then their eyes were opened, and they both realized that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together and made clothes for themselves.
GEN.3.8	 In the cool of the evening, the man and his wife heard the L
GEN.3.9	 The L
GEN.3.10	 He answered, “I heard you in the garden. I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”
GEN.3.11	 God asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat fruit from the tree I commanded you not to eat from?”
GEN.3.12	 The man answered, “That woman, the one you gave me, gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
GEN.3.13	 Then the L
GEN.3.13	“The snake deceived me, and I ate,” the woman answered.
GEN.3.14	 So the L
GEN.3.14	You are cursed more than all the wild or domestic animals.
GEN.3.14	You will crawl on your belly.
GEN.3.14	You will be the lowest of animals as long as you live.
GEN.3.15	 I will make you and the woman hostile toward each other.
GEN.3.15	I will make your descendants
GEN.3.15	and her descendant hostile toward each other.
GEN.3.15	He will crush your head,
GEN.3.15	and you will bruise his heel.”
GEN.3.16	 He said to the woman,
GEN.3.16	“I will increase your pain and your labor
GEN.3.16	when you give birth to children.
GEN.3.16	Yet, you will long for your husband,
GEN.3.16	and he will rule you.”
GEN.3.17	 Then he said to the man, “You listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree, although I commanded you, ‘You must never eat its fruit.’
GEN.3.17	The ground is cursed because of you.
GEN.3.17	Through hard work you will eat ⌊food that comes⌋ from it
GEN.3.17	every day of your life.
GEN.3.18	 The ground will grow thorns and thistles for you,

GEN.4.20	 Adah gave birth to Jabal. He was the first person to live in tents and have livestock. 
GEN.4.21	 His brother’s name was Jubal. He was the first person to play the harp and the flute. 
GEN.4.22	 Zillah also had a son, Tubalcain, who made bronze and iron tools. Tubalcain’s sister was Naamah.

GEN.6.8	 But the L
GEN.6.9	 This is the account of Noah and his de scendants.
GEN.6.9	Noah had God’s approval and was a man of integrity among the people of his time. He walked with God. 
GEN.6.10	 He had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	 The world was corrupt in God’s sight and full of violence. 
GEN.6.12	 God saw the world and how corrupt it was because all people on earth lived evil lives.
GEN.6.13	 God said to Noah, “I have decided to put an end to all people because the earth is full of their violence. Now I’m going to destroy them along with the earth. 
GEN.6.14	 Make yourself a ship of cypress wood. 
GEN.6.15	 This is how you should build it: the ship is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. 
GEN.6.16	 Make a roof for the ship, and leave an 18-inch-high opening at the top.
GEN.6.17	 I’m about to send a flood on the earth to destroy all people under the sky—every living, breathing human. Everything on earth will die.
GEN.6.18	 “But I will make my promise 
GEN.6.19	 Bring two of every living creature into the ship in order to keep them alive with you. They must be male and female. 
GEN.6.20	 Two of every type of bird, every type of domestic animal, and every type of creature that crawls on the ground will come to you to be kept alive. 
GEN.6.21	 Take every kind of food that can be eaten and store it. It will be food for you and the animals.”
GEN.6.22	 Noah did this. He did everything that God had commanded him.

GEN.7.2	 Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal (a male and a female of each) and one pair of every kind of unclean 
GEN.7.3	 Also, take seven pairs of every kind of bird (a male and a female of each) to preserve animal life all over the earth after the flood. 
GEN.7.4	 In seven days I will send rain to the earth for 40 days and 40 nights. I will wipe off the face of the earth every living creature that I have made.”
GEN.7.5	 So Noah did everything that the L
GEN.7.6	 Noah was 600 years old when the flood came to the earth. 
GEN.7.7	 Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives went into the ship to escape the floodwaters. 
GEN.7.8	 Clean and unclean animals, birds, and creatures that crawl on the ground 
GEN.7.9	 came to Noah to go into the ship in pairs (a male and female of each) as God had commanded Noah.
GEN.7.10	 Seven days later the flood came on the earth. 
GEN.7.11	 On the seventeenth day of the second month of the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, all the deep springs burst open. The sky opened, 
GEN.7.12	 and rain came pouring down on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights.
GEN.7.13	 On that same day Noah and his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, as well as Noah’s wife and his three daughters-in-law went into the ship. 
GEN.7.14	 They had with them every type of wild animal, every type of domestic animal, every type of creature that crawls on the earth, and every type of bird (every creature with wings). 
GEN.7.15	 A pair of every living, breathing animal came to Noah to go into the ship. 
GEN.7.16	 A male and a female of every animal went in as God had commanded Noah. Then the L
GEN.7.17	 The flood continued for 40 days on the earth. The water increased and lifted the ship so that it rose high above the ground. 
GEN.7.18	 As the water rose and became very deep, the ship floated on top of the water. 
GEN.7.19	 The water rose very high above the earth. It covered all the high mountains everywhere under the sky. 
GEN.7.20	 It rose 23 feet above the mountaintops.
GEN.7.21	 Every creature that crawls on the earth died, including birds, domestic and wild animals, and everything that swarms over the earth, along with every human. 
GEN.7.22	 Everything on dry land (every living, breathing creature) died. 
GEN.7.23	 Every living creature on the face of the earth was wiped out. Humans, domestic animals, crawling creatures, and birds were wiped off the earth. Only Noah and those with him in the ship were left.
GEN.7.24	 The floodwaters were on the earth for 150 days.
GEN.8.1	 God remembered Noah and all the wild and domestic animals with him in the ship. So God made a wind blow over the earth, and the water started to go down. 
GEN.8.2	 The deep springs and the sky had been shut, and the rain had stopped pouring. 
GEN.8.3	 The water began to recede from the land. At the end of 150 days the water had decreased. 
GEN.8.4	 On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ship came to rest in the mountains of Ararat. 
GEN.8.5	 The water kept decreasing until the tenth month. On the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains appeared.
GEN.8.6	 After 40 more days Noah opened the window he had made in the ship 
GEN.8.7	 and sent out a raven. It kept flying back and forth until the water on the land had dried up. 
GEN.8.8	 Next, he sent out a dove to see if the water was gone from the surface of the ground. 
GEN.8.9	 The dove couldn’t find a place to land because the water was still all over the earth. So it came back to Noah in the ship. He reached out and brought the dove back into the ship. 
GEN.8.10	 He waited seven more days and again sent the dove out of the ship. 
GEN.8.11	 The dove came to him in the evening, and in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf. Then Noah knew that the water was gone from the earth. 
GEN.8.12	 He waited seven more days and sent out the dove again, but it never came back to him.
GEN.8.13	 By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water on the land had dried up. Noah opened the top of the ship, looked out, and saw the surface of the ground. 
GEN.8.14	 By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the land was dry.
GEN.8.15	 Then God spoke to Noah, 
GEN.8.16	 “Come out of the ship with your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives. 
GEN.8.17	 Bring out every animal that’s with you: birds, domestic animals, and every creature that crawls on the earth. Be fertile, increase in number, and spread over the earth.”
GEN.8.18	 So Noah came out with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives. 
GEN.8.19	 Every animal, crawling creature, and bird—everything that moves on the earth—came out of the ship, one kind after another.
GEN.8.20	 Noah built an altar to the L

GEN.8.22	planting and harvesting,
GEN.8.22	cold and heat,
GEN.8.22	summer and winter,
GEN.8.22	day and night
GEN.8.22	will never stop.”
GEN.9.1	 God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fertile, increase in number, and fill the earth. 
GEN.9.2	 All the wild animals and all the birds will fear you and be terrified of you. Every creature that crawls on the ground and all the fish in the sea have been put under your control. 
GEN.9.3	 Everything that lives and moves will be your food. I gave you green plants as food; I now give you everything else.
GEN.9.4	 “But you are not to eat meat with blood in it. (Blood is life.) 
GEN.9.5	 In addition, I will demand your blood for your life. I will demand it from any animal or from any person. I will demand the life of any person ⌊who kills⌋ another person.
GEN.9.6	 Whoever sheds human blood,
GEN.9.6	by humans his blood will be shed,
GEN.9.6	because in the image of God, God made humans.
GEN.9.7	 Be fertile, and increase in number. Spread over the earth, and increase.”
GEN.9.8	 God also said to Noah and his sons, 
GEN.9.9	 “I am going to make my promise 
GEN.9.10	 and every living being that is with you—birds, domestic animals, and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ship—every living thing on earth. 
GEN.9.11	 I am making my promise to you. Never again will all life be killed by floodwaters. Never again will there be a flood that destroys the earth.”
GEN.9.12	 God said, “This is the sign of the promise I am giving to you and every living being that is with you for generations to come. 
GEN.9.13	 I will put my rainbow in the clouds to be a sign of my promise to the earth. 
GEN.9.14	 Whenever I form clouds over the earth, a rainbow will appear in the clouds. 
GEN.9.15	 Then I will remember my promise to you and every living animal. Never again will water become a flood to destroy all life. 
GEN.9.16	 Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember my everlasting promise to every living animal on earth.”
GEN.9.17	 So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the promise I am making to all life on earth.”
GEN.9.18	 Noah’s sons, who came out of the ship, were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
GEN.9.19	 These were Noah’s three sons. From them the whole earth was populated. Ham was the father of Canaan.
GEN.9.20	 Noah, a farmer, was the first person to plant a vineyard. 
GEN.9.21	 He drank some wine, got drunk, and lay naked inside his tent. 
GEN.9.22	 Ham, father of Canaan, saw his father naked. So he went outside and told his two brothers.
GEN.9.23	 Shem and Japheth took a blanket and laid it over their shoulders. Then they walked in backwards and covered their father’s naked body. They turned their faces away so that they didn’t see their father naked.
GEN.9.24	 When Noah sobered up, he found out what his youngest son had done to him. 
GEN.9.25	 So he said,
GEN.9.25	“Canaan is cursed!
GEN.9.25	He will be the lowest slave to his brothers.
GEN.9.26	 Praise the L
GEN.9.26	Canaan will be his slave.
GEN.9.27	 May God expand the territory of Japheth.
GEN.9.27	May he live in the tents of Shem.
GEN.9.27	Canaan will be his slave.”
GEN.9.28	 Noah lived 350 years after the flood. 
GEN.9.29	 Noah lived a total of 950 years; then he died.
GEN.10.1	 This is the account of Noah’s sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their descendants. Shem, Ham and Japheth had children after the flood.
GEN.10.2	 Japheth’s descendants were
GEN.10.2	Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
GEN.10.3	 Gomer’s descendants were
GEN.10.3	Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
GEN.10.4	 Javan’s descendants were
GEN.10.4	the people from Elishah, Tarshish, Cyprus, and Rhodes.
GEN.10.5	 From these descendants the people of the coastlands spread into their own countries. Each nation had its own language and families.
GEN.10.6	 Ham’s descendants were
GEN.10.6	Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
GEN.10.7	 Cush’s descendants were
GEN.10.7	Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah,

GEN.10.20	 These were Ham’s descendants by families and languages within their countries and nations.
GEN.10.21	 Shem, Japheth’s older brother, also had children. ⌊Shem was⌋ the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.

GEN.10.25	The name of the one was Peleg [Division], because in his day the earth was divided.
GEN.10.25	His brother’s name was Joktan.

GEN.10.30	 The region where they lived extended from Mesha toward Sephar in the eastern mountains.
GEN.10.31	 These were Shem’s descendants by families and languages within their countries according to their nations.
GEN.10.32	 These were the families of Noah’s sons listed by their genealogies, nation by nation. From these ⌊descendants⌋ the nations spread over the earth after the flood.
GEN.11.1	 The whole world had one language with a common vocabulary.

GEN.11.20	 Reu was 32 years old when he became the father of Serug. 
GEN.11.21	 After he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.

GEN.11.24	 Nahor was 29 years old when he became the father of Terah. 
GEN.11.25	 After he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	 Terah was 70 years old when he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	 This is the account of Terah and his descendants. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran was the father of Lot. 
GEN.11.28	 While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, his native land. 
GEN.11.29	 Both Abram and Nahor married. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, daughter of Haran. (Haran was the father of Milcah and Iscah.) 
GEN.11.30	 Sarai was not able to have children.
GEN.11.31	 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (son of Haran), and his daughter-in-law Sarai, wife of his son Abram. They set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. When they came as far as Haran, they stayed there.

GEN.12.10	 There was a famine in the land. Abram went to Egypt to stay awhile because the famine was severe. 
GEN.12.11	 When he was about to enter Egypt, Abram said to his wife Sarai, “I know that you’re a beautiful woman. 
GEN.12.12	 When the Egyptians see you, they’ll say, ‘This is his wife!’ Then they’ll kill me but let you live. 
GEN.12.13	 Please say that you’re my sister. Then everything will be alright for me, and because of you I will live.”
GEN.12.14	 When Abram arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians saw how very beautiful his wife was. 
GEN.12.15	 When Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they raved about her to Pharaoh, so Sarai was taken to Pharaoh’s palace. 
GEN.12.16	 Everything went well for Abram because of her, and he was given sheep, cattle, donkeys, male and female slaves, and camels.
GEN.12.17	 However, the L
GEN.12.18	 Then Pharaoh called for Abram. “What have you done to me?” he asked. “Why didn’t you tell me that she’s your wife? 
GEN.12.19	 Why did you say, ‘She’s my sister’ and allow me to take her for my wife? Here’s your wife! Take her and go!” 
GEN.12.20	 Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning Abram. They sent Abram away with his wife and everything that he had.
GEN.13.1	 Abram left Egypt with his wife and everything he had and went to the Negev. Lot was with him. 
GEN.13.2	 Abram was very rich because he had livestock, silver, and gold. 
GEN.13.3	 He traveled from place to place. He went from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the area between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been originally, 
GEN.13.4	 where he had first made an altar. There Abram worshiped the L
GEN.13.5	 Lot, who had been traveling with Abram, also had his own sheep, cattle, and tents. 
GEN.13.6	 There wasn’t enough pastureland for both of them. They had so many possessions that they were unable to remain together. 
GEN.13.7	 Quarrels broke out between Abram’s herders and Lot’s herders. (Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in that area.)
GEN.13.8	 Abram said to Lot, “Please, let’s not have any more quarrels between us or between our herders. After all, we’re relatives. 
GEN.13.9	 Isn’t all this land yours also? Let’s separate. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right, and if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.” 
GEN.13.10	 Then Lot looked in the direction of Zoar as far as he could see. He saw that the whole Jordan Plain was well-watered like the L
GEN.13.11	 Lot chose the whole Jordan Plain for himself. He moved toward the east. They each went their own way.

GEN.13.17	 Go! Walk back and forth across the entire land because I will give it to you.” 
GEN.13.18	 So Abram moved his tents and went to live by the oak trees belonging to Mamre at Hebron. There he built an altar for the L
GEN.14.1	 At that time ⌊four kings⌋—King Amraphel of Shinar, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim—
GEN.14.2	 went to war against ⌊five kings⌋—King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 
GEN.14.3	 The five kings joined forces and met in the valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea). 
GEN.14.4	 For 12 years they had been subject to Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
GEN.14.5	 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and his allies came and defeated the Rephaim at Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim at Ham, the Emim at Shaveh Kiriathaim, 
GEN.14.6	 and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, going as far as El Paran on the edge of the desert. 
GEN.14.7	 On their way back, they came to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites and also the Amorites who were living at Hazazon Tamar.
GEN.14.8	 Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and prepared for battle in the valley of Siddim. 
GEN.14.9	 They fought against King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar—four kings against five. 
GEN.14.10	 The valley of Siddim was full of tar pits. As the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell because of the tar pits, but the other kings fled to the hills. 
GEN.14.11	 So the four kings took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, as well as all their food, and left. 
GEN.14.12	 They also took Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions since he was living in Sodom.
GEN.14.13	 Then a soldier who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew what had happened. He was living next to the oak trees belonging to Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner. (These men were Abram’s allies.)
GEN.14.14	 When Abram heard that his nephew had been captured, he armed 
GEN.14.15	 He split up his men to attack them at night. He defeated them, pursuing them all the way to Hobah, which is north of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	 He brought back everything they had, including women and soldiers. He also brought back his relative Lot and his possessions.
GEN.14.17	 After Abram came back from defeating Chedorlaomer and his allies, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Shaveh Valley (that is, the King’s Valley). 
GEN.14.18	 Then King Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was a priest of God Most High. 
GEN.14.19	 He blessed Abram, and said,
GEN.14.19	“Blessed is Abram by God Most High,
GEN.14.19	maker 
GEN.14.20	 Blessed is God Most High,
GEN.14.20	who has handed your enemies over to you.”
GEN.14.20	Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
GEN.14.21	 The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, and keep everything else for yourself.”
GEN.14.22	 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I now raise my hand and solemnly swear to the L
GEN.14.23	 that I won’t take a thread or a sandal strap. I won’t take anything that is yours so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ 
GEN.14.24	 I won’t take one single thing except what my men have eaten. But let my allies Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.”
GEN.15.1	 Later the L
GEN.15.1	“Abram, don’t be afraid.

GEN.15.1	Your reward will be very great.” 
GEN.15.2	 Abram asked, “Almighty L
GEN.15.3	 You have given me no children, so this member of my household will be my heir.”
GEN.15.4	 Suddenly, the L
GEN.15.5	 He took Abram outside and said, “Now look up at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” He also said to him, “That’s how many descendants you will have!”

GEN.15.9	 He answered Abram, “Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a mourning dove, and a pigeon.” 
GEN.15.10	 So Abram brought all these animals to him. He cut each of them in half and laid each half opposite the other. However, he did not cut the birds in half.
GEN.15.11	 When birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away. 
GEN.15.12	 As the sun was just about to set, a deep sleep—a dreadful, deep darkness—came over Abram.
GEN.15.13	 God said to Abram, “You can know for sure that your descendants will live in a land that is not their own, where they will be slaves, and they will be oppressed for 400 years. 
GEN.15.14	 But I will punish the nation they serve, and after that they will come out with many possessions. 
GEN.15.15	 But you will die in peace and be buried at a very old age. 
GEN.15.16	 In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, because the sin of the Amorites will not have run its course until then.”
GEN.15.17	 The sun had gone down, and it was dark. Suddenly a smoking oven and a flaming torch passed between the animal pieces. 
GEN.15.18	 At that time the L

GEN.16.5	 So Sarai complained to Abram, “I’m being treated unfairly! And it’s your fault! I know that I gave my slave to you, but now that she’s pregnant, she’s being disrespectful to me. May the L

GEN.16.8	 He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s slave, where have you come from, and where are you going?”

GEN.16.14	 This is why the well is named Beer Lahai Roi [Well of the Living One Who Watches Over Me]. It is still there between Kadesh and Bered.
GEN.16.15	 Hagar gave birth to Abram’s son. Abram named him Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	 Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.
GEN.17.1	 When Abram was 99 years old, the L
GEN.17.2	 I will give you my promise,
GEN.17.3	 Immediately, Abram bowed with his face touching the ground, and again God spoke to him, 
GEN.17.4	 “My promise is still with you. You will become the father of many nations. 
GEN.17.5	 So your name will no longer be Abram [Exalted Father], but Abraham [Father of Many] because I have made you a father of many nations. 
GEN.17.6	 I will give you many descendants. Many nations and kings will come from you. 
GEN.17.7	 I will make my promise to you and your descendants for generations to come as an everlasting promise. I will be your God and the God of your descendants. 
GEN.17.8	 I am also giving this land where you are living—all of Canaan—to you and your descendants as your permanent possession. And I will be your God.”
GEN.17.9	 God also said to Abraham, “You and your descendants in generations to come are to be faithful to my promise. 
GEN.17.10	 This is how you are to be faithful to my promise: Every male among you is to be circumcised. 
GEN.17.11	 All of you must be circumcised. That will be the sign of the promise from me to you. 
GEN.17.12	 For generations to come every male child who is eight days old must be circumcised, whether he is born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner who’s not related to you. 
GEN.17.13	 Every male born in your household or bought with your money is to be circumcised without exception. So my promise will be a sign on your flesh, an everlasting promise. 
GEN.17.14	 Any uncircumcised male must be excluded from his people because he has rejected my promise.”
GEN.17.15	 God said to Abraham, “Don’t call your wife by the name Sarai anymore. Instead, her name is Sarah [Princess]. 
GEN.17.16	 I will bless her, and I will also give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will become ⌊a mother of⌋ nations, and kings will come from her.” 
GEN.17.17	 Immediately, Abraham bowed with his face touching the ground. He laughed as he thought to himself, “Can a son be born to a hundred-year-old man? Can Sarah, a ninety-year-old woman, have a child?” 
GEN.17.18	 Then Abraham said to God, “Why not let Ishmael be my heir?”
GEN.17.19	 God replied, “No! Your wife Sarah will give you a son, and you will name him Isaac [He Laughs]. I will make an everlasting promise to him and his descendants. 
GEN.17.20	 I have heard your request about Ishmael. Yes, I will bless him, make him fertile, and increase the number of his descendants. He will be the father of 12 princes, and I will make him a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	 But I will make my promise to Isaac. Sarah will give birth to him at this time next year.” 
GEN.17.22	 When God finished speaking with Abraham, he left him.
GEN.17.23	 So Abraham took his son Ishmael, everyone born in his household, and everyone bought with money—every male in his household—and circumcised them that day, as God had told him. 
GEN.17.24	 Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised. 
GEN.17.25	 His son Ishmael was 13 years old when he was circumcised. 
GEN.17.26	 That same day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised. 
GEN.17.27	 All the men of his household, whether born in the household or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

GEN.18.2	 Abraham looked up, and suddenly he saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them, and he bowed with his face touching the ground.
GEN.18.3	 “Please, sir,” Abraham said, “stop by to visit me for a while. 
GEN.18.4	 Why don’t we let someone bring a little water? After you wash your feet, you can stretch out and rest under the tree. 
GEN.18.5	 Let me bring some bread so that you can regain your strength. After that you can leave, since this is why you stopped by to visit me.”
GEN.18.5	They answered, “That’s fine. Do as you say.”
GEN.18.6	 So Abraham hurried into the tent to find Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three measures of flour, knead it, and make bread.”
GEN.18.7	 Then Abraham ran to the herd and took one of his best calves. He gave it to his servant, who prepared it quickly. 
GEN.18.8	 Abraham took cheese and milk, as well as the meat, and set these in front of them. Then he stood by them under the tree as they ate.
GEN.18.9	 They asked him, “Where is your wife Sarah?”
GEN.18.9	He answered, “Over there, in the tent.”

GEN.18.10	Sarah happened to be listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind him. 
GEN.18.11	 Abraham and Sarah were old. Sarah was past the age of childbearing.

GEN.18.24	 What if there are 50 innocent people in the city? Are you really going to sweep them away? Won’t you spare that place for the sake of the 50 innocent people who are in it? 
GEN.18.25	 It would be unthinkable for you to do such a thing, to treat the innocent and the guilty alike and to kill the innocent with the guilty. That would be unthinkable! Won’t the judge of the whole earth do what is fair?”

GEN.18.30	 “Please don’t be angry if I speak again,” Abraham said. “What if 30 are found there?”
GEN.18.30	He answered, “If I find 30 there, I will not do it.”
GEN.18.31	 “Look now, if I may be so bold as to ask you,” Abraham said. “What if 20 are found there?”

GEN.18.32	 “Please don’t be angry if I speak only one more time,” Abraham said. “What if 10 are found there?”

GEN.19.1	 The two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gateway. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed with his face touching the ground. 
GEN.19.2	 He said, “Please, gentlemen, why don’t you come to my home and spend the night? ⌊You can⌋ wash your feet there. Then early tomorrow morning you can continue your journey.”
GEN.19.2	“No,” they answered, “we’d rather spend the night in the city square.”
GEN.19.3	 But he insisted so strongly that they came with him and went into his home. He prepared a special dinner for them, baked some unleavened bread, and they ate. 
GEN.19.4	 Before they had gone to bed, all the young and old male citizens of Sodom surrounded the house. 
GEN.19.5	 They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to ⌊stay with⌋ you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”
GEN.19.6	 Then Lot went outside and shut the door behind him. 
GEN.19.7	 “Please, my friends, don’t be so wicked,” he said. 
GEN.19.8	 “Look, I have two daughters who have never had sex. Why don’t you let me bring them out to you? Do whatever you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, since I’m responsible for them.”
GEN.19.9	 But the men yelled, “Get out of the way! This man came here to stay awhile. Now he wants to be our judge! We’re going to treat you worse than those men.” They pushed hard against Lot and lunged forward to break down the door. 
GEN.19.10	 The men ⌊inside⌋ reached out, pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. 
GEN.19.11	 Then they struck all the men who were in the doorway of the house, young and old alike, with blindness so that they gave up trying to find the door.
GEN.19.12	 Then the men asked Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—any in-laws, sons, daughters, or any other relatives in the city? Get them out of here

GEN.19.19	 Even though you’ve been so good to me and though you’ve been very kind to me by saving my life, I can’t run as far as the hills. This disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die. 
GEN.19.20	 Look, there’s a city near enough to flee to, and it’s small. Why don’t you let me run there? Isn’t it small? Then my life will be saved.”
GEN.19.21	 The angel said to him, “Alright, I will grant you this request too. I will not destroy the city you’re talking about. 
GEN.19.22	 Run there quickly, because I can’t do anything until you get there.” (The city is named Zoar [Small].)
GEN.19.23	 The sun had just risen over the land as Lot came to Zoar. 
GEN.19.24	 Then the L
GEN.19.25	 He destroyed those cities, the whole plain, all who lived in the cities, and whatever grew on the ground. 
GEN.19.26	 Lot’s wife looked back and turned into a column of salt.
GEN.19.27	 Early the next morning Abraham came to the place where he had stood in front of the L
GEN.19.28	 When he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land in the plain, he saw smoke rising from the land like the thick smoke of a furnace.
GEN.19.29	 When God destroyed the cities on the plain, he remembered Abraham. Lot was allowed to escape from the destruction that came to the cities where he was living.
GEN.19.30	 Lot left Zoar because he was afraid to stay there. He and his two daughters settled in the mountains where they lived in a cave. 
GEN.19.31	 The older daughter said to the younger one, “Our father is old. No men are here. We can’t get married as other people do. 
GEN.19.32	 Let’s give our father wine to drink. Then we’ll go to bed with him so that we’ll be able to preserve our family line through our father.” 
GEN.19.33	 That night they gave their father wine to drink. Then the older one went to bed with her father. He didn’t know when she came to bed or when she got up. 
GEN.19.34	 The next day the older daughter said to the younger one, “I did it! Last night I went to bed with my father. Let’s give him wine to drink again tonight. Then you go to bed with him so that we’ll be able to preserve our family line through our father.” 
GEN.19.35	 That night they gave their father wine to drink again. Then the younger one went to bed with him. He didn’t know when she came to bed or when she got up. 
GEN.19.36	 So Lot’s two daughters became pregnant by their father. 
GEN.19.37	 The older one gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the ancestor of the Moabites of today. 
GEN.19.38	 The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben Ammi. He is the ancestor of the Ammonites of today.
GEN.20.1	 Abraham moved to the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was living in Gerar, 
GEN.20.2	 Abraham told everyone that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar sent men to take Sarah. 
GEN.20.3	 God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him, “You’re going to die because of the woman that you’ve taken! She’s a married woman!” 
GEN.20.4	 Abimelech hadn’t come near her, so he asked, “Lord, will you destroy a nation even if it’s innocent? 
GEN.20.5	 Didn’t he tell me himself, ‘She’s my sister,’ and didn’t she even say, ‘He’s my brother’? I did this in all innocence and with a clear conscience.”
GEN.20.6	 “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience,” God said to him in the dream. “In fact, I kept you from sinning against me. That’s why I didn’t let you touch her. 
GEN.20.7	 Give the man’s wife back to him now, because he’s a prophet. He will pray for you, and you will live. But if you don’t give her back, you and all who belong to you are doomed to die.”
GEN.20.8	 Early in the morning Abimelech called together all his officials. He told them about all of this, and they were terrified. 
GEN.20.9	 Then Abimelech called for Abraham and asked him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you that you would bring such a serious sin on me and my kingdom? You shouldn’t have done this to me.” 
GEN.20.10	 Abimelech also asked Abraham, “What were you thinking when you did this?”
GEN.20.11	 Abraham said, “I thought that because there are no God-fearing people in this place, I’d be killed because of my wife. 
GEN.20.12	 Besides, she is my sister—my father’s daughter but not my mother’s. She is also my wife. 
GEN.20.13	 When God had me leave my father’s home and travel around, I said to her, ‘Do me a favor: Wherever we go, say that I’m your brother.’ ”
GEN.20.14	 Then Abimelech took sheep, cattle, and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham. He also gave his wife Sarah back to him. 
GEN.20.15	 Abimelech said, “Look, here’s my land. Live anywhere you like.” 
GEN.20.16	 He said to Sarah, “Don’t forget, I’ve given your brother 25 pounds of silver. This is to silence any criticism against you from everyone with you. You’re completely cleared.”
GEN.20.17	 Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so that they could have children. 
GEN.20.18	 (The L
GEN.21.1	 The L
GEN.21.2	 So she became pregnant, and at the exact time God had promised, she gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age. 
GEN.21.3	 Abraham named his newborn son Isaac. 
GEN.21.4	 When Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him as God had commanded. 
GEN.21.5	 Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born.
GEN.21.6	 Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me. 
GEN.21.7	 Who would have predicted to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet, I have given him a son in his old age.”
GEN.21.8	 The child grew and was weaned. On the day Isaac was weaned, Abraham held a big feast. 
GEN.21.9	 Sarah saw that Abraham’s son by Hagar the Egyptian was laughing at Isaac. 
GEN.21.10	 She said to Abraham, “Get rid of this slave and her son, because this slave’s son must never share the inheritance with my son Isaac.” 
GEN.21.11	 Abraham was upset by this because of his son Ishmael. 
GEN.21.12	 But God said to Abraham, “Don’t be upset about the boy and your slave. Listen to what Sarah says because through Isaac your descendants will carry on your name. 
GEN.21.13	 Besides, I will make the slave’s son into a nation also, because he is your child.”
GEN.21.14	 Early the next morning Abraham took bread and a container of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder. He also gave her the boy and sent her on her way. So she left and wandered around in the desert near Beersheba. 
GEN.21.15	 When the water in the container was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes. 
GEN.21.16	 Then she went about as far away as an arrow can be shot and sat down. She said to herself, “I don’t want to watch the boy die.” So she sat down and sobbed loudly.
GEN.21.17	 God heard the boy crying, and the Messenger of God called to Hagar from heaven. “What’s the matter, Hagar?” he asked her. “Don’t be afraid! God has heard the boy crying from the bushes. 
GEN.21.18	 Come on, help the boy up! Take him by the hand, because I’m going to make him into a great nation.”
GEN.21.19	 God opened her eyes. Then she saw a well. She filled the container with water and gave the boy a drink.
GEN.21.20	 God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became a skilled archer. 
GEN.21.21	 He lived in the desert of Paran, and his mother got him a wife from Egypt.
GEN.21.22	 At that time Abimelech, accompanied by Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do. 
GEN.21.23	 Now, swear an oath to me here in front of God that you will never cheat me, my children, or my descendants. Show me and the land where you’ve been living the same kindness that I have shown you.”
GEN.21.24	 Abraham said, “I so swear.”
GEN.21.25	 Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well which Abimelech’s servants had seized. 
GEN.21.26	 Abimelech replied, “I don’t know who did this. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t hear about it until today.”
GEN.21.27	 Abraham took some sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made an agreement. 
GEN.21.28	 Then Abraham set apart seven female lambs from the flock. 
GEN.21.29	 Abimelech asked him, “What is the meaning of these seven female lambs you have set apart?”
GEN.21.30	 Abraham answered, “Accept these lambs from me so that they may be proof 
GEN.21.31	 This is why that place is called Beersheba,
GEN.21.32	 After they made the treaty at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, left and went back to the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba and worshiped the L
GEN.21.34	 Abraham lived a long time in the land of the Philistines.
GEN.22.1	 Later God tested Abraham and called to him, “Abraham!”
GEN.22.1	“Yes, here I am!” he answered.
GEN.22.2	 God said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I will show you.”
GEN.22.3	 Early the next morning Abraham saddled his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut the wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place that God had told him about. 
GEN.22.4	 Two days later Abraham saw the place in the distance. 
GEN.22.5	 Then Abraham said to his servants, “You stay here with the donkey while the boy and I go over there. We’ll worship. After that we’ll come back to you.”
GEN.22.6	 Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and gave it to his son Isaac. Abraham carried the burning coals and the knife. The two of them went on together.
GEN.22.7	 Isaac spoke up and said, “Father?”
GEN.22.7	“Yes, Son?” Abraham answered.
GEN.22.7	Isaac asked, “We have the burning coals and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
GEN.22.8	 Abraham answered, “God will provide a lamb for the burnt offering, Son.”
GEN.22.8	The two of them went on together. 
GEN.22.9	 When they came to the place that God had told him about, Abraham built the altar and arranged the wood on it. Then he tied up his son Isaac and laid him on top of the wood on the altar. 
GEN.22.10	 Next, Abraham picked up the knife and took it in his hand to sacrifice his son. 
GEN.22.11	 But the Messenger of the L
GEN.22.11	“Yes?” he answered.
GEN.22.12	 “Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you did not refuse to give me your son, your only son.”
GEN.22.13	 When Abraham looked around, he saw a ram behind him caught by its horns in a bush. So Abraham took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering in place of his son. 
GEN.22.14	 Abraham named that place The L
GEN.22.15	 Then the Messenger of the L
GEN.22.16	 and said, “I am taking an oath on my own name, declares the L
GEN.22.17	 I will certainly bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and the grains of sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of their enemies’ cities. 
GEN.22.18	 Through your descendant all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me.”
GEN.22.19	 Then Abraham returned to his servants, and together they left for Beersheba. Abraham remained in Beersheba.
GEN.22.20	 Later Abraham was told, “Milcah has given birth to these children of your brother Nahor: 
GEN.22.21	 Uz (the firstborn), Buz (his brother), Kemuel (father of Aram), 
GEN.22.22	 Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 
GEN.22.23	 Bethuel is the father of Rebekah. Milcah had these eight sons by Abraham’s brother Nahor. 
GEN.22.24	 Nahor’s concubine,
GEN.23.1	 Sarah lived to be 127 years old. This was the length of her life. 
GEN.23.2	 She died in Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in Canaan. Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to cry about her death.
GEN.23.3	 Then Abraham left the side of his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites, 
GEN.23.4	 “I’m a stranger with no permanent home. Let me have some of your property for a tomb so that I can bury my dead wife.”
GEN.23.5	 The Hittites answered Abraham, 
GEN.23.6	 “Listen to us, sir. You are a mighty leader among us. Bury your dead in one of our best tombs. Not one of us will withhold from you his tomb for burying your dead.”
GEN.23.7	 Abraham got up in front of the Hittites, the people of that region, and bowed with his face touching the ground. 
GEN.23.8	 He said to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my wife, listen to me. Encourage Ephron, son of Zohar, 
GEN.23.9	 to let me have the cave of Machpelah that he owns at the end of his field. He should sell it to me for its full price as my property to be used as a tomb among you.”
GEN.23.10	 Ephron was sitting among the Hittites. He answered Abraham so that everyone who was entering the city gate could hear him. He said, 
GEN.23.11	 “No, sir, listen to me. I’m giving you the field together with the cave that is in it. My people are witnesses that I’m giving it to you. Bury your wife!”
GEN.23.12	 Abraham bowed down again in front of the people of that region. 
GEN.23.13	 He spoke to Ephron so that the people of that region could hear him. He said, “If you would only listen to me. I will pay you the price of the field. Take it from me so that I can bury my wife there.”
GEN.23.14	 Ephron answered Abraham, 
GEN.23.15	 “Sir, listen to me. The land is worth ten pounds of silver. What is that between us? Bury your wife!”
GEN.23.16	 Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms. So he weighed out for Ephron the amount stated in front of the Hittites: ten pounds of silver at the current merchants’ exchange rate.
GEN.23.17	 So Ephron’s field at Machpelah, east of Mamre, was sold 
GEN.23.18	 to Abraham. His property included the field with the cave in it as well as all the trees inside the boundaries of the field.
GEN.23.19	 After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah, east of Mamre (that is, Hebron). 
GEN.23.20	 So the field and its cave were sold by the Hittites to Abraham as his property to be used as a tomb.
GEN.24.1	 By now Abraham was old, and the L
GEN.24.2	 So Abraham said to the senior servant of his household who was in charge of all that he owned, “Take a solemn oath. 
GEN.24.3	 I want you to swear by the L
GEN.24.4	 Instead, you will go to the land of my relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.”
GEN.24.5	 The servant asked him, “What if the woman doesn’t want to come back to this land with me? Should I take your son all the way back to the land you came from?”
GEN.24.6	 “Make sure that you do not take my son back there,” Abraham said to him. 
GEN.24.7	 “The L
GEN.24.7	“God will send his angel ahead of you, and you will get my son a wife from there. 
GEN.24.8	 If the woman doesn’t want to come back with you, then you’ll be free from this oath that you swear to me. But don’t take my son back there.” 
GEN.24.9	 So the servant did as his master Abraham commanded and swore the oath to him concerning this.
GEN.24.10	 Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and left, taking with him all of his master’s best things. He traveled to Aram Naharaim, Nahor’s city.
GEN.24.11	 The servant had the camels kneel down outside the city by the well. It was evening, when the women would go out to draw water. 
GEN.24.12	 Then he prayed, “L
GEN.24.13	 Here I am standing by the spring, and the girls of the city are coming out to draw water. 
GEN.24.14	 I will ask a girl, ‘May I please have a drink from your jar?’ If she answers, ‘Have a drink, and I’ll also water your camels,’ let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. This way I’ll know that you’ve shown your kindness to my master.”
GEN.24.15	 Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor. 
GEN.24.16	 The girl was a very attractive virgin. No man had ever had sexual intercourse with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came back.
GEN.24.17	 The servant ran to meet her and said, “Please give me a drink of water.”
GEN.24.18	 “Drink, sir,” she said. She quickly lowered her jar to her hand and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	 When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I’ll also keep drawing water for your camels until they’ve had enough to drink.” 
GEN.24.20	 So she quickly emptied her jar into the water trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. 
GEN.24.21	 The man was silently watching her to see whether or not the L
GEN.24.22	 When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a fifth of an ounce and two gold bracelets weighing four ounces. 
GEN.24.23	 He asked, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me whether there is room in your father’s house for us to spend the night.”
GEN.24.24	 She answered him, “I’m the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah and Nahor. 
GEN.24.25	 We have plenty of straw and feed ⌊for your camels⌋ and room for you to spend the night.”
GEN.24.26	 The man knelt, bowing to the L
GEN.24.27	 He said, “Praise the L
GEN.24.28	 The girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things. 
GEN.24.29	 Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. 
GEN.24.30	 He saw the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists and heard her tell what the man had said to her. Immediately, Laban ran out to the man by the spring.
GEN.24.31	 He said, “Come in, you whom the L
GEN.24.32	 So the man went into the house. The camels were unloaded and given straw and feed. Then water was brought for him and his men to wash their feet. 
GEN.24.33	 When the food was put in front of him, he said, “I won’t eat until I’ve said what I have to say.”
GEN.24.33	“Speak up,” Laban said.
GEN.24.34	 “I am Abraham’s servant,” he said. 
GEN.24.35	 “The L
GEN.24.36	 My master’s wife Sarah gave him a son in her old age, and my master has given that son everything he has. 
GEN.24.37	 My master made me swear this oath: ‘Don’t get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I’m living. 
GEN.24.38	 Instead, go to my father’s home and to my relatives, and get my son a wife.’
GEN.24.39	 “I asked my master, ‘What if the woman won’t come back with me?’
GEN.24.40	 “He answered me, ‘I have been living the way the L
GEN.24.41	 Then you will be free from your oath to me. You will also be free of your oath to me if my relatives are not willing to do this when you go to them.’
GEN.24.42	 “When I came to the spring today, I prayed, ‘L

GEN.24.45	 “Before I had finished praying, Rebekah came with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water.
GEN.24.45	“So I asked her, ‘May I have a drink?’ 
GEN.24.46	 She quickly lowered her jar and said, ‘Have a drink, and I’ll water your camels too.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels.
GEN.24.47	 “Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’
GEN.24.47	“She answered, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor and Milcah.’
GEN.24.47	“I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. 
GEN.24.48	 I knelt, bowing down to the L

GEN.24.50	 Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the L

GEN.24.52	 When Abraham’s servant heard their answer, he bowed down to the L
GEN.24.53	 The servant took out gold and silver jewelry and clothes and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother. 
GEN.24.54	 Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they got up in the morning, he said, “Let me go back to my master.”
GEN.24.55	 Her brother and mother replied, “Let the girl stay with us ten days or so. After that she may go.”
GEN.24.56	 He said to them, “Don’t delay me now that the L
GEN.24.57	 So they said, “We’ll call the girl and ask her.”
GEN.24.58	 They called for Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?”
GEN.24.58	She said, “Yes, I’ll go.”
GEN.24.59	 So they let their sister Rebekah and her nurse go with Abraham’s servant and his men. 
GEN.24.60	 They gave Rebekah a blessing:
GEN.24.60	“May you, our sister, become the mother of many thousands of children.
GEN.24.60	May your descendants take possession of their enemies’ cities.”
GEN.24.61	 Then Rebekah and her maids left. Riding on camels, they followed the man. The servant took Rebekah and left.
GEN.24.62	 Isaac had just come back from Beer Lahai Roi, since he was living in the Negev. 
GEN.24.63	 Toward evening Isaac went out into the field to meditate.
GEN.24.64	 When Rebekah saw Isaac, she got down from her camel. 
GEN.24.65	 She asked the servant, “Who is that man over there coming through the field to meet us?”
GEN.24.65	“That is my master,” the servant answered. Then she took her veil and covered herself. 
GEN.24.66	 The servant reported to Isaac everything he had done. 
GEN.24.67	 Isaac took her into his mother Sarah’s tent. He married Rebekah. She became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
GEN.25.1	 Abraham married again, and his wife’s name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	 Keturah gave birth to these sons of Abraham: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	 Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. Dedan’s descendants were the Assyrians, the Letushites, and the Leummites. 
GEN.25.4	 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. These were the descendants of Keturah.
GEN.25.5	 Abraham left everything he had to Isaac. 
GEN.25.6	 But while he was still living, Abraham had given gifts to the sons of his concubines.
GEN.25.7	 Abraham lived 175 years. 
GEN.25.8	 Then he took his last breath, and died at a very old age. After a long and full life, he joined his ancestors in death. 
GEN.25.9	 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephron, son of Zohar the Hittite. The cave is east of Mamre. 
GEN.25.10	 This was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah. 
GEN.25.11	 After Abraham died, God blessed his son Isaac, who settled near Beer Lahai Roi.
GEN.25.12	 This is the account of the descendants of Abraham’s son Ishmael. He was the son of Sarah’s Egyptian slave Hagar and Abraham. 
GEN.25.13	 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth (Ishmael’s firstborn), Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	 These are the sons of Ishmael and their names listed by their settlements and camps—12 leaders of their tribes.
GEN.25.17	 Ishmael lived 137 years. Then he took his last breath and died. He joined his ancestors in death. 
GEN.25.18	 His descendants lived as nomads from the region of Havilah to Shur, which is near Egypt, in the direction of Assyria. They all fought with each other.
GEN.25.19	 This is the account of Abraham’s son Isaac and his descendants. Abraham was the father of Isaac. 
GEN.25.20	 Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean. 
GEN.25.21	 Isaac prayed to the L
GEN.25.22	 When the children inside her were struggling with each other, she said, “If it’s like this now, what will become of me?”
GEN.25.23	 The L
GEN.25.23	“Two countries are in your womb.
GEN.25.23	Two nations will go their separate ways from birth.
GEN.25.23	One nation will be stronger than the other,
GEN.25.23	and the older will serve the younger.”
GEN.25.24	 When the time came for her to give birth, she had twins. 
GEN.25.25	 The first one born was red. His whole body was covered with hair, so they named him Esau [Hairy]. 
GEN.25.26	 Afterwards, his brother was born with his hand holding on to Esau’s heel, and so he was named Jacob [Heel]. Isaac was 60 years old when they were born.
GEN.25.27	 They grew up. Esau became an expert hunter, an outdoorsman. Jacob remained a quiet man, staying around the tents. 
GEN.25.28	 Because Isaac liked to eat the meat of wild animals, he loved Esau. However, Rebekah loved Jacob.
GEN.25.29	 Once, Jacob was preparing a meal when Esau, exhausted, came in from outdoors. 
GEN.25.30	 So Esau said to Jacob, “Let me have the whole pot of red stuff to eat—that red stuff—I’m exhausted.” This is why he was called Edom.
GEN.25.31	 Jacob responded, “First, sell me your rights as firstborn.”
GEN.25.32	 “I’m about to die.” Esau said. “What good is my inheritance to me?”
GEN.25.33	 “First, swear an oath,” Jacob said. So Esau swore an oath to him and sold him his rights as firstborn. 
GEN.25.34	 Then Jacob gave Esau a meal of bread and lentils. He ate and drank, and then he got up and left.
GEN.25.34	This is how Esau showed his contempt for his rights as firstborn.
GEN.26.1	 There was a famine in the land in addition to the earlier one during Abraham’s time. So Isaac went to King Abimelech of the Philistines in Gerar.
GEN.26.2	 The L
GEN.26.3	 Live here in this land for a while, and I will be with you and bless you. I will give all these lands to you and your descendants. I will keep the oath that I swore to your father Abraham.

GEN.26.5	 I will bless you because Abraham obeyed me and completed the duties, commands, laws, and instructions I gave him.” 
GEN.26.6	 So Isaac lived in Gerar.
GEN.26.7	 When the men of that place asked about his wife, Isaac answered, “She’s my sister.” He was afraid to say “my wife.” He thought that the men of that place would kill him to get Rebekah, because she was an attractive woman. 
GEN.26.8	 When he had been there a long time, King Abimelech of the Philistines looked out of his window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
GEN.26.9	 Abimelech called for Isaac and said, “So she’s really your wife! How could you say, ‘She’s my sister’?”
GEN.26.9	Isaac answered him, “I thought I would be killed because of her.”
GEN.26.10	 Then Abimelech said, “What have you done to us! One of the people might have easily gone to bed with your wife, and then you would have made us guilty of sin.” 
GEN.26.11	 So Abimelech ordered his people, “Anyone who touches this man or his wife will be put to death.”
GEN.26.12	 Isaac planted ⌊crops⌋ in that land. In that same year he harvested a hundred times as much as he had planted because the L
GEN.26.13	 He continued to be successful, becoming very rich. 
GEN.26.14	 Because he owned so many flocks, herds, and servants, the Philistines became jealous of him. 
GEN.26.15	 So the Philistines filled in all the wells that his father’s servants had dug during his father Abraham’s lifetime.
GEN.26.16	 Finally, Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us! You’ve become more powerful than we are.”
GEN.26.17	 So Isaac moved away. He set up his tents in the Gerar Valley and lived there. 
GEN.26.18	 He dug out the wells that had been dug during his father Abraham’s lifetime. The Philistines had filled them in after Abraham’s death. He gave them the same names that his father had given them.
GEN.26.19	 Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found a spring-fed well. 
GEN.26.20	 The herders from Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herders, claiming, “This water is ours!” So Isaac named the well Esek [Argument], because they had argued with him. 
GEN.26.21	 Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that one too. So Isaac named it Sitnah [Accusation]. 
GEN.26.22	 He moved on from there and dug another well. They didn’t quarrel over this one. So he named it Rehoboth [Roomy] and said, “Now the L
GEN.26.23	 He went from there to Beersheba. 
GEN.26.24	 That night the L
GEN.26.25	 So Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the L
GEN.26.26	 Abimelech, his friend Ahuzzath, and Phicol, the commander of his army, came from Gerar to see Isaac. 
GEN.26.27	 Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and sent me away from you?”
GEN.26.28	 They answered, “We have seen that the L
GEN.26.29	 that you will not harm us, since we have not touched you. We have done only good to you and let you go in peace. Now you are blessed by the L
GEN.26.30	 Isaac prepared a special dinner for them, and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	 Early the next morning they exchanged oaths. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left peacefully.
GEN.26.32	 That same day Isaac’s servants came and told him about a well they had dug. They said to him, “We’ve found water.” 
GEN.26.33	 So he named it Shibah [Oath]. That is why the name of the city is still Beersheba today.
GEN.26.34	 When Esau was 40 years old, he married Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite. He also married Basemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
GEN.26.35	 These women brought Isaac and Rebekah a lot of grief.
GEN.27.1	 When Isaac was old and going blind, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “Son!”
GEN.27.1	Esau answered, “Here I am.”
GEN.27.2	 Isaac said, “I’m old. I don’t know when I’m going to die. 
GEN.27.3	 Now take your hunting equipment, your quiver and bow, and go out into the open country and hunt some wild game for me. 
GEN.27.4	 Prepare a good-tasting meal for me, just the way I like it. Bring it to me to eat so that I will bless you before I die.”
GEN.27.5	 Rebekah was listening while Isaac was speaking to his son Esau. When Esau went into the open country to hunt for some wild game to bring back, 
GEN.27.6	 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I’ve just heard your father speaking to your brother Esau. 
GEN.27.7	 He said, ‘Bring me some wild game, and prepare a good-tasting meal for me to eat so that I will bless you in the presence of the L
GEN.27.8	 Now listen to me, Son, and do what I tell you. 
GEN.27.9	 Go to the flock, and get me two good young goats. I’ll prepare them as a good-tasting meal for your father, just the way he likes it. 
GEN.27.10	 Then take it to your father to eat so that he will bless you before he dies.”
GEN.27.11	 Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, “My brother Esau is a hairy man, and my skin is smooth.
GEN.27.12	 My father will feel ⌊my skin⌋ and think I’m mocking him. Then I’ll bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing.”
GEN.27.13	 His mother responded, “Let any curse on you fall on me, Son. Just obey me and go! Get me ⌊the young goats⌋.”
GEN.27.14	 He went and got them and brought them to his mother. She prepared a good-tasting meal, just the way his father liked it. 
GEN.27.15	 Then Rebekah took her older son Esau’s good clothes, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. 
GEN.27.16	 She put the skins from the young goats on his hands and on the back of his neck. 
GEN.27.17	 Then she gave her son Jacob the good-tasting meal and the bread she had prepared.
GEN.27.18	 He went to his father and said, “Father?”
GEN.27.18	“Yes?” he answered. “Who are you, Son?”
GEN.27.19	 Jacob answered his father, “I’m Esau, your firstborn. I’ve done what you told me. Sit up and eat this meat I’ve hunted for you so that you may bless me.”
GEN.27.20	 Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, Son?”
GEN.27.20	“The L
GEN.27.21	 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come over here so that I can feel your skin, Son, ⌊to find out⌋ whether or not you really are my son Esau.” 
GEN.27.22	 So Jacob went over to his father. Isaac felt ⌊his skin⌋. “The voice is Jacob’s,” he said, “but the hands are Esau’s.” 
GEN.27.23	 He didn’t recognize Jacob, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands. So he blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	 “Are you really my son Esau?” he asked him.
GEN.27.24	“I am,” Jacob answered.
GEN.27.25	 Isaac said, “Bring me some of the game, and I will eat it, Son, so that I will bless you.” Jacob brought it to Isaac, and he ate it. Jacob also brought him wine, and he drank it.
GEN.27.26	 Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here and give me a kiss, Son.” 
GEN.27.27	 He went over and gave him a kiss. When Isaac smelled his clothes, he blessed him and said,
GEN.27.27	“The smell of my son
GEN.27.27	is like the smell of open country
GEN.27.27	that the L
GEN.27.28	 May God give you dew from the sky,
GEN.27.28	fertile fields on the earth,
GEN.27.28	and plenty of fresh grain and new wine.
GEN.27.29	 May nations serve you.
GEN.27.29	May people bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	Be the master of your brothers,
GEN.27.29	and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	May those who curse you be cursed.
GEN.27.29	May those who bless you be blessed.”
GEN.27.30	 Isaac finished blessing Jacob. Jacob had barely left when his brother Esau came in from hunting. 
GEN.27.31	 He, too, prepared a good-tasting meal and brought it to his father. Then he said to his father, “Please, Father, eat some of the meat I’ve hunted for you so that you will bless me.”
GEN.27.32	 “Who are you?” his father Isaac asked him.
GEN.27.32	“I’m your firstborn son Esau,” he an swered.
GEN.27.33	 Trembling violently all over, Isaac asked, “Who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it before you came in. I blessed him, and he will stay blessed.”
GEN.27.34	 When Esau heard these words from his father, he shouted out a very loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me too, Father!”
GEN.27.35	 Isaac said, “Your brother came and deceived me and has taken away your blessing.”
GEN.27.36	 Esau said, “Isn’t that why he’s named Jacob? He’s cheated me twice already: He took my rights as firstborn, and now he’s taken my blessing.” So he asked, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?”
GEN.27.37	 Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him your master, and I have made all his brothers serve him. I’ve provided fresh grain and new wine for him. What is left for me to do for you, Son?”
GEN.27.38	 Esau asked, “Do you have only one blessing, Father? Bless me too, Father!” And Esau sobbed loudly.
GEN.27.39	 His father Isaac answered him,
GEN.27.39	“The place where you live will lack the fertile fields of the earth
GEN.27.39	and the dew from the sky above.
GEN.27.40	 You will use your sword to live,
GEN.27.40	and you will serve your brother.
GEN.27.40	But eventually you will gain your freedom 
GEN.27.40	and break his yoke 
GEN.27.41	 So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing that his father had given him. Esau said to himself, “The time to mourn for my father is near. Then I’ll kill my brother Jacob.”
GEN.27.42	 When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Watch out! Your brother Esau is comforting himself by planning to kill you.
GEN.27.43	 So now, Son, obey me. Quick! Run away to my brother Laban in Haran. 
GEN.27.44	 Stay with him awhile, until your brother’s anger cools down. 
GEN.27.45	 When your brother’s anger is gone and he has forgotten what you did to him, I’ll send for you and get you back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”
GEN.27.46	 Rebekah said to Isaac, “I can’t stand Hittite women! If Jacob marries a Hittite woman like one of those from around here, I might as well die.”
GEN.28.1	 Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him, “You are not to marry any of the Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.2	 Quick! Go to Paddan Aram. Go to the home of Bethuel, your mother’s father, and get yourself a wife from there from the daughters of your uncle Laban. 
GEN.28.3	 May God Almighty bless you, make you fertile, and increase the number of your descendants so that you will become a community of people. 
GEN.28.4	 May he give to you and your descendants the blessing of Abraham so that you may take possession of the land where you are now living, the land that God gave to Abraham.”
GEN.28.5	 Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan Aram. Jacob went to live with Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean and brother of Rebekah. She was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
GEN.28.6	 Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Paddan Aram to get a wife from there. He learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had commanded him not to marry any of the Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.7	 He also learned that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had left for Paddan Aram. 
GEN.28.8	 Esau realized that his father Isaac disapproved of Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.9	 So he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth, in addition to the wives he had.
GEN.28.10	 Jacob left Beersheba and traveled toward Haran. 
GEN.28.11	 When he came to a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had gone down. He took one of the stones from that place, put it under his head, and lay down there. 
GEN.28.12	 He had a dream in which he saw a stairway set up on the earth with its top reaching up to heaven. He saw the angels of God going up and coming down on it. 
GEN.28.13	 The L
GEN.28.14	 Your descendants will be like the dust on the earth. You will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. Through you and through your descendant every family on earth will be blessed. 
GEN.28.15	 Remember, I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go. I will also bring you back to this land because I will not leave you until I do what I’ve promised you.”
GEN.28.16	 Then Jacob woke up from his sleep and exclaimed, “Certainly, the L
GEN.28.17	 Filled with awe, he said, “How awe-inspiring this place is! Certainly, this is the house of God and the gateway to heaven!”
GEN.28.18	 Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had put under his head. He set it up as a marker and poured olive oil on top of it. 
GEN.28.19	 He named that place Bethel [House of God]. Previously, the name of the city was Luz.
GEN.28.20	 Then Jacob made a vow: “If God will be with me and will watch over me on my trip and give me food to eat and clothes to wear, 
GEN.28.21	 and if I return safely to my father’s home, then the L
GEN.28.22	 This stone that I have set up as a marker will be the house of God, and I will surely give you a tenth of everything you give me.”
GEN.29.1	 Jacob continued on his trip and came to the land in the east. 
GEN.29.2	 He looked around, and out in a field he saw a well with a large stone over the opening. Three flocks of sheep were lying down near it, because the flocks were watered from that well. 
GEN.29.3	 When all the flocks were gathered there, the stone would be rolled off the opening of the well so that the sheep could be watered. Then the stone would be put back in place over the opening of the well.
GEN.29.4	 Jacob asked some people, “My friends, where are you from?”
GEN.29.4	“We’re from Haran,” they replied.
GEN.29.5	 He asked them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?”
GEN.29.5	They answered, “We do.”
GEN.29.6	 “How is he doing?” Jacob asked them.
GEN.29.6	“He’s fine,” they answered. “Here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”
GEN.29.7	 “It’s still the middle of the day,” he said. “It isn’t time yet to gather the livestock. Water the sheep. Then let them graze.”
GEN.29.8	 They replied, “We can’t until all the flocks are gathered. When the stone is rolled off the opening of the well, we can water the sheep.”
GEN.29.9	 While he was still talking to them, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep, because she was a shepherd. 
GEN.29.10	 Jacob saw Rachel, daughter of his uncle Laban, with his uncle Laban’s sheep. He came forward and rolled the stone off the opening of the well and watered his uncle Laban’s sheep. 
GEN.29.11	 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and sobbed loudly. 
GEN.29.12	 When Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s nephew and that he was Rebekah’s son, she ran and told her father.
GEN.29.13	 As soon as Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran to meet him. He hugged and kissed him and brought him into his home. Then Jacob told Laban all that had happened. 
GEN.29.14	 Laban said to him, “You are my own flesh and blood.”
GEN.29.14	Jacob stayed with him for a whole month. 
GEN.29.15	 Then Laban said to him, “Just because you’re my relative doesn’t mean that you should work for nothing. Tell me what your wages should be.”
GEN.29.16	 Laban had two daughters. The name of the older one was Leah, and the name of the younger one was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	 Leah had attractive eyes,
GEN.29.18	 Jacob loved Rachel. So he offered, “I’ll work seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.”
GEN.29.19	 Laban responded, “It’s better that I give her to you than to any other man. Stay with me.” 
GEN.29.20	 Jacob worked seven years in return for Rachel, but the years seemed like only a few days to him because he loved her.
GEN.29.21	 ⌊At the end of the seven years⌋ Jacob said to Laban, “The time is up; give me my wife! I want to sleep with her.” 
GEN.29.22	 So Laban invited all the people of that place and gave a wedding feast. 
GEN.29.23	 In the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob. Jacob slept with her. When morning came, he realized it was Leah.
GEN.29.24	 (Laban had given his slave Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her slave.)
GEN.29.25	 “What have you done to me?” Jacob asked Laban. “Didn’t I work for you in return for Rachel? Why did you cheat me?”
GEN.29.26	 Laban answered, “It’s not our custom to give the younger daughter ⌊in marriage⌋ before the older one. 
GEN.29.27	 Finish the week of wedding festivities with this daughter. Then we will give you the other one too. But you’ll have to work for me another seven years.”
GEN.29.28	 That’s what Jacob did. He finished the week with Leah. Then Laban gave his daughter Rachel to him as his wife. 
GEN.29.29	 (Laban had given his slave Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her slave.) 
GEN.29.30	 Jacob slept with Rachel too. He loved Rachel more than Leah. So he worked for Laban another seven years.
GEN.29.31	 When the L
GEN.29.32	 Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben [Here’s My Son], because she said, “Certainly, the L
GEN.29.33	 She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said, “Certainly, the L
GEN.29.34	 She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me because I’ve given him three sons.” So she named him Levi [Attached]. 
GEN.29.35	 She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said, “This time I will praise the L
GEN.30.1	 Rachel saw that she could not have children for Jacob, and she became jealous of her sister. She said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I’ll die!”
GEN.30.2	 Jacob became angry with Rachel and asked, “Can I take the place of God, who has kept you from having children?”
GEN.30.3	 She said, “Here’s my servant Bilhah. Sleep with her. She can have children for me, and I can build a family for myself through her.” 
GEN.30.4	 So she gave him her slave Bilhah as his wife, and Jacob slept with her. 
GEN.30.5	 Bilhah became pregnant, and she gave birth to a son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.6	 Rachel said, “Now God has judged in my favor. He has heard my prayer and has given me a son.” So she named him Dan [He Judges].
GEN.30.7	 Rachel’s slave Bilhah became pregnant again and gave birth to a second son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.8	 Rachel said, “I have had a great struggle 
GEN.30.9	 When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her slave Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as his wife. 
GEN.30.10	 Leah’s slave Zilpah gave birth to a son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.11	 Leah said, “I’ve been lucky!” So she called him Gad [Luck].
GEN.30.12	 Leah’s slave Zilpah gave birth to her second son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.13	 Leah said, “I’ve been blessed! Women will call me blessed.” So she named him Asher [Blessing].
GEN.30.14	 During the wheat harvest Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrakes.
GEN.30.15	 Leah replied, “Isn’t it enough that you took my husband? Are you also going to take my son’s mandrakes?”
GEN.30.15	Rachel said, “Very well, Jacob can go to bed with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.16	 As Jacob was coming in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. “You are to sleep with me,” she said. “You are my reward for my son’s mandrakes.” So he went to bed with her that night. 
GEN.30.17	 God answered Leah’s prayer. She became pregnant and gave birth to her fifth son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.18	 Leah said, “God has given me my reward because I gave my slave to my husband.” So she named him Issachar [Reward].
GEN.30.19	 She became pregnant again and gave birth to her sixth son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.20	 Leah said, “God has presented me with a beautiful present. This time my husband will honor me because I have given him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun [Honor].
GEN.30.21	 Later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
GEN.30.22	 Then God remembered Rachel. God answered her prayer and made it possible for her to have children. 
GEN.30.23	 So she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. Then she said, “God has taken away my disgrace.” 
GEN.30.24	 She named him Joseph [May He Give Another] and said, “May the L
GEN.30.25	 After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Let me go home to my own country. 
GEN.30.26	 Give me my wives and my children for whom I’ve worked, and let me go. You know how much work I’ve done for you.”
GEN.30.27	 Laban replied, “Listen to me. I’ve learned from the signs I’ve seen that the L
GEN.30.28	 So he offered, “Name your wages, and I’ll pay them.”
GEN.30.29	 Jacob responded, “You know how much work I’ve done for you and what has happened to your livestock under my care. 
GEN.30.30	 The little that you had before I came has grown to a large amount. The L
GEN.30.31	 Laban asked, “What should I give you?”
GEN.30.31	“Don’t give me anything,” Jacob answered. “Instead, do something for me, then I’ll go back to taking care of and watching your flocks again. 
GEN.30.32	 Let me go through all of your flocks today and take every speckled or spotted sheep, every black lamb, and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages. 
GEN.30.33	 My honesty will speak for itself whenever you come to check on my wages. Any goat I have that isn’t speckled or spotted or any lamb that isn’t black will be considered stolen.”
GEN.30.34	 Laban answered, “Agreed. We’ll do as you’ve said.” 
GEN.30.35	 However, that same day Laban took out the striped and spotted male goats, all the speckled and spotted female goats (every one with white on it), and every black lamb. He had his sons take charge of them. 
GEN.30.36	 He traveled three days away from Jacob. Jacob continued to take care of the rest of Laban’s flocks.
GEN.30.37	 Then Jacob took fresh-cut branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled the bark on them in strips of white, uncovering the white which was on the branches.
GEN.30.38	 He placed the peeled branches in the troughs directly in front of the flocks, at the watering places where the flocks came to drink. When they were in heat and came to drink, 
GEN.30.39	 they mated in front of the branches. Then they gave birth to young that were striped, speckled, or spotted.
GEN.30.40	 Jacob separated the rams from the flock and made the rest of the sheep face any that were striped or black in Laban’s flocks. So he made separate herds for himself and did not add them to Laban’s flocks. 
GEN.30.41	 Whenever the stronger of the flocks were in heat, Jacob would lay the branches in the troughs in front of them so that they would mate by the branches. 
GEN.30.42	 But when the flocks in heat were weak, he didn’t lay down the branches. So the weaker ones belonged to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob. 
GEN.30.43	 As a result, Jacob became very wealthy. He had large flocks, male and female slaves, camels, and donkeys.
GEN.31.1	 Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father and has gained all his wealth from him.” 
GEN.31.2	 He also noticed that Laban did not appear as friendly to him as before.
GEN.31.3	 Then the L
GEN.31.4	 So Jacob sent a message to Rachel and Leah to come out to the open country where his flocks were. 
GEN.31.5	 He said to them, “I have seen that your father isn’t as friendly to me as he was before, but the God of my father has been with me. 
GEN.31.6	 You know that I have worked as hard as I could for your father. 
GEN.31.7	 Your father has cheated me. He has changed my wages ten times. But God hasn’t let him harm me. 
GEN.31.8	 Whenever he said, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ all the flocks gave birth to speckled young. And whenever he said, ‘The striped ones will be your wages,’ all the flocks gave birth to striped young. 
GEN.31.9	 So God has taken away your father’s livestock and has given them to me.
GEN.31.10	 “During the mating season I had a dream: I looked up and saw that the male goats which were mating were striped, speckled, or spotted. 
GEN.31.11	 In the dream the Messenger of God called to me, ‘Jacob!’ And I answered, ‘Yes, here I am.’ 
GEN.31.12	 He said, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats which are mating are striped, speckled, or spotted, because I have seen everything that Laban is doing to you. 
GEN.31.13	 I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel,
GEN.31.14	 Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there anything left in our father’s household for us to inherit? 
GEN.31.15	 Doesn’t he think of us as foreigners? Not only did he sell us, but he has used up the money that was paid for us. 
GEN.31.16	 Certainly, all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. Now do whatever God has told you.”
GEN.31.17	 Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels. 
GEN.31.18	 He drove all his livestock ahead of him and took all the possessions that he had accumulated. He took his own livestock that he had accumulated in Paddan Aram and went back to his father Isaac in Canaan.
GEN.31.19	 When Laban went to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s idols. 
GEN.31.20	 Jacob also tricked Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was leaving. 
GEN.31.21	 So he left in a hurry with all that belonged to him. He crossed the Euphrates River and went toward the mountains of Gilead.
GEN.31.22	 Two days later Laban was told that Jacob had left in a hurry. 
GEN.31.23	 He and his relatives pursued Jacob for seven days. Laban caught up with him in the mountains of Gilead.
GEN.31.24	 God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Be careful not to say anything at all to Jacob.”
GEN.31.25	 When Laban finally caught up with Jacob, Jacob had put up his tents in the mountains. So Laban and his relatives put up their tents in the mountains of Gilead. 
GEN.31.26	 Then Laban asked Jacob, “What have you done by tricking me? You’ve carried off my daughters like prisoners of war. 
GEN.31.27	 Why did you leave secretly and trick me? You didn’t even tell me you were leaving. I would have sent you on your way rejoicing, with songs accompanied by tambourines and lyres. 
GEN.31.28	 You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters. You’ve done a foolish thing. 
GEN.31.29	 I have the power to harm you. Last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything at all to Jacob.’ 
GEN.31.30	 Now you have left for your father’s home because you were so homesick. But why did you steal my gods?”
GEN.31.31	 Jacob answered Laban, “I left because I was afraid. I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force. 
GEN.31.32	 If you find your gods, the one who has them will not be allowed to live. In the presence of our relatives, search as much as you want through what I have, and take what is yours.” (Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen the gods.)
GEN.31.33	 So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two slaves. But he found nothing. He came out of Leah’s tent and went into Rachel’s tent. 
GEN.31.34	 Rachel had taken the idols and had put them in her camel’s saddle-bag and was sitting on them. Laban rummaged through the whole tent but found nothing.
GEN.31.35	 Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, Father, but I can’t get up to greet you; I’m having my period.” So even though Laban had made a thorough search, he didn’t find the idols.
GEN.31.36	 Then Jacob became angry and confronted Laban. “What is my crime?” Jacob demanded of Laban. “What is my offense that you have come chasing after me? 
GEN.31.37	 Now that you’ve rummaged through all my things, did you find anything from your house? Put it here in front of all our relatives. Let them decide which one of us is right.
GEN.31.38	 “I’ve been with you for 20 years. Your sheep and goats never miscarried, and I never ate any rams from your flocks. 
GEN.31.39	 I never brought you any of the flock that was killed by wild animals. I paid for the loss myself. That’s what you demanded of me when any of the flock was stolen during the day or at night. 
GEN.31.40	 The scorching heat during the day and the cold at night wore me down, and I lost a lot of sleep. 
GEN.31.41	 I’ve been with your household 20 years now. I worked for you 14 years for your two daughters and 6 years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times. 
GEN.31.42	 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac,
GEN.31.43	 Then Laban answered Jacob, “These are my daughters, my grandchildren, and my flocks. Everything you see is mine! Yet, what can I do today for my daughters or for their children? 
GEN.31.44	 Now, let’s make an agreement and let it stand as a witness between you and me.”
GEN.31.45	 Jacob took a stone and set it up as a marker. 
GEN.31.46	 Then Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” They took stones, put them into a pile, and ate there by the pile of stones. 
GEN.31.47	 ⌊In his language⌋ Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha [Witness Pile], but Jacob called it Galeed.
GEN.31.48	 Laban said, “This pile of stones stands as a witness between you and me today.” This is why it was named Galeed 
GEN.31.49	 and also Mizpah [Watchtower], because he said, “May the L
GEN.31.50	 If you mistreat my daughters or marry other women behind my back, remember that God stands as a witness between you and me.”
GEN.31.51	 Laban said to Jacob, “Here is the pile of stones, and here is the marker that I have set up between you and me. 
GEN.31.52	 This pile of stones and this marker stand as witnesses that I will not go past the pile of stones to harm you, and that you will not go past the pile of stones or marker to harm me. 
GEN.31.53	 May the God of Abraham and Nahor—the God of their father—judge between us.”
GEN.31.53	So Jacob swore this oath by the Fear of his father Isaac 
GEN.31.54	 and offered a sacrifice on the mountain. He invited his relatives to eat the meal with him. They ate with him and spent the night on the mountain.
GEN.31.55	 Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban left and went back home.
GEN.32.1	 As Jacob went on his way, God’s angels met him. 
GEN.32.2	 When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s camp!” He named that place Mahanaim [Two Camps].
GEN.32.3	 Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in Seir, the country of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	 He commanded them to give this message to Esau, “Sir, this is what Jacob has to say, ‘I’ve been living with Laban and have stayed until now. 
GEN.32.5	 I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, and male and female slaves. I’ve sent ⌊these messengers⌋ to tell you ⌊this news⌋ in order to win your favor.’ ”
GEN.32.6	 When the messengers came back to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you with 400 men.”
GEN.32.7	 Jacob was terrified and distressed. So he divided the people, the sheep and goats, the cattle, and the camels into two camps. 
GEN.32.8	 He thought, “If Esau attacks the one camp, then the other camp will be able to escape.”
GEN.32.9	 Then Jacob prayed, “God of my grandfather Abraham and God of my father Isaac! L
GEN.32.10	 I’m not worthy of all the love and faithfulness you have shown me. I only had a shepherd’s staff when I crossed the Jordan River, but now I have two camps. 
GEN.32.11	 Please save me from my brother Esau, because I’m afraid of him. I’m afraid that he’ll come and attack me and the mothers and children too. 
GEN.32.12	 But you did say, ‘I will make sure that you are prosperous and that your descendants will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. No one will be able to count them because there are so many.’ ”
GEN.32.13	 He stayed there that night. Then he prepared a gift for his brother Esau from what he had brought with him: 
GEN.32.14	 200 female goats and 20 male goats, 200 female sheep and 20 male sheep, 
GEN.32.15	 30 female camels with their young, 40 cows and 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys.
GEN.32.16	 He placed servants in charge of each herd. Then he said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep a distance between the herds.” 
GEN.32.17	 He commanded the first servant, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and whose animals are these ahead of you?’ 
GEN.32.18	 then say, ‘Sir, they belong to your servant Jacob. This is a gift sent to you. Jacob is right behind us.’” 
GEN.32.19	 He also commanded the second servant, the third, and all the others who followed the herds. He said, “Say the same thing to Esau when you find him. 
GEN.32.20	 And be sure to add, ‘Jacob is right behind us, sir.’” He thought, “I’ll make peace with him by giving him this gift that I’m sending ahead of me. After that I will see him, and he’ll welcome me back.” 
GEN.32.21	 So Jacob sent the gift ahead of him while he stayed in the camp that night.
GEN.32.22	 During that night he got up and gathered his two wives, his two slaves and his eleven children and crossed at the shallow part of the Jabbok River. 
GEN.32.23	 After he sent them across the stream, he sent everything else across. 
GEN.32.24	 So Jacob was left alone. Then a man wrestled with him until dawn. 
GEN.32.25	 When the man saw that he could not win against Jacob, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that it was dislocated as they wrestled. 
GEN.32.26	 Then the man said, “Let me go; it’s almost dawn.”
GEN.32.26	But Jacob answered, “I won’t let you go until you bless me.”
GEN.32.27	 So the man asked him, “What’s your name?”
GEN.32.27	“Jacob,” he answered.
GEN.32.28	 The man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel [He Struggles With God], because you have struggled with God and with men—and you have won.”
GEN.32.29	 Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.”
GEN.32.29	The man answered, “Why do you ask for my name?” Then he blessed Jacob there. 
GEN.32.30	 So Jacob named that place Peniel [Face of God], because he said, “I have seen God face to face, but my life was saved.” 
GEN.32.31	 The sun rose as he passed Penuel.
GEN.32.32	 (Therefore, even today the people of Israel do not eat the muscle of the thigh attached to the hip socket because God touched the socket of Jacob’s hip at the muscle of the thigh.)
GEN.33.1	 Jacob saw Esau coming with 400 men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two slaves. 
GEN.33.2	 He put the slaves and their children in front, Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph last. 
GEN.33.3	 He went on ahead of them and bowed seven times with his face touching the ground as he came near his brother.
GEN.33.4	 Then Esau ran to meet Jacob. Esau hugged him, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. They both cried. 
GEN.33.5	 When he saw the women and children, Esau asked, “Who are these people here with you?”
GEN.33.5	“The children God has graciously given me, sir,” Jacob answered.
GEN.33.6	 Then the slaves and their children came forward and bowed down. 
GEN.33.7	 Likewise, Leah and her children came forward and bowed down. Finally, Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed down.
GEN.33.8	 Then Esau asked, “Why did you send this whole group ⌊of people and animals⌋ I met?”
GEN.33.8	He answered, “To win your favor, sir.”
GEN.33.9	 Esau said, “I have enough. Keep what you have, Brother.”
GEN.33.10	 Jacob said, “No, please take the gift I’m giving you, because I’ve seen your face as if I were seeing the face of God, and yet you welcomed me so warmly. 
GEN.33.11	 Please take the present I’ve brought you, because God has been gracious to me and has given me all that I need.” So Esau took it because Jacob insisted.
GEN.33.12	 Then Esau said, “Let’s get ready to go, and I’ll go with you.”
GEN.33.13	 Jacob said to him, “Sir, you know that the children are frail and that I have to take care of the flocks and cattle that are nursing their young. If they’re driven too hard for even one day, all the flocks will die. 
GEN.33.14	 Go ahead of me, sir. I will slowly and gently guide the herds that are in front of me at their pace and at the children’s pace until I come to you in Seir.”
GEN.33.15	 Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.”
GEN.33.15	“Why do that?” Jacob asked. “I only want to win your favor, sir.”
GEN.33.16	 That day Esau started back to Seir. 
GEN.33.17	 But Jacob moved on to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is named Succoth [Shelters].
GEN.33.18	 So having come from Paddan Aram, Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem in Canaan. He camped within sight of the city. 
GEN.33.19	 Then he bought the piece of land on which he had put up his tents. He bought it from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for 100 pieces of silver. 
GEN.33.20	 He set up an altar there and named it God Is the God of Israel.
GEN.34.1	 Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to visit some of the Canaanite women. 
GEN.34.2	 When Shechem, son of the local ruler Hamor the Hivite, saw her, he took her and raped her. 
GEN.34.3	 He became very fond of Jacob’s daughter Dinah. He loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her.
GEN.34.4	 So Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl for my wife.”
GEN.34.5	 Jacob heard that Shechem had dishonored his daughter Dinah. His sons were with his livestock out in the open country, so Jacob kept quiet until they came home.
GEN.34.6	 So Shechem’s father Hamor came to Jacob to speak with him. 
GEN.34.7	 Jacob’s sons came in from the open country as soon as they heard the news. The men felt outraged and very angry because Shechem had committed such a godless act against Israel’s family by raping Jacob’s daughter. This shouldn’t have happened.
GEN.34.8	 Hamor told them. “My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please let her marry him. 
GEN.34.9	 Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us, and take ours for yourselves. 
GEN.34.10	 You can live with us, and the land will be yours. Live here, move about freely in this area, and acquire property here.”
GEN.34.11	 Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and her brothers, “Do me this favor. I’ll give you whatever you ask. 
GEN.34.12	 Set the price I must pay for the bride and the gift I must give her as high as you want. I’ll pay exactly what you tell me. Give me the girl as my wife.”
GEN.34.13	 Then Jacob’s sons gave Shechem and his father Hamor a misleading answer because he had dishonored their sister Dinah. 
GEN.34.14	 They said, “We can’t do this. We can’t give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised. That would be a disgrace to us! 
GEN.34.15	 We will give our consent to you only on one condition: Every male must be circumcised as we are. 
GEN.34.16	 Then we’ll give our daughters to you and take yours for ourselves, and we’ll live with you and become one people. 
GEN.34.17	 If you won’t agree to be circumcised, we’ll take our daughter and go.”
GEN.34.18	 Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. 
GEN.34.19	 The young man didn’t waste any time in doing what they said because he took such pleasure in Jacob’s daughter. He was the most honored person in all his father’s family.
GEN.34.20	 So Hamor and his son Shechem went to their city gate to speak to the men of their city. They said, 
GEN.34.21	 “These people are friendly toward us, so let them live in our land and move about freely in the area. Look, there’s plenty of room in this land for them. We can marry their daughters and let them marry ours. 
GEN.34.22	 These people will consent to live with us and become one nation on one condition: Every male must be circumcised as they are. 
GEN.34.23	 Won’t their livestock, their personal property, and all their animals be ours? We only need to agree to do this for them. Then they’ll live with us.”
GEN.34.24	 All the men who had come out to the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem. So they were all circumcised at the city gate.
GEN.34.25	 Two days later, while the men were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and boldly attacked the city. They killed every man 
GEN.34.26	 including Hamor and his son Shechem. They took Dinah from Shechem’s home and left. 
GEN.34.27	 Then Jacob’s sons stripped the corpses and looted the city where their sister had been dishonored. 
GEN.34.28	 They took the sheep and goats, cattle, donkeys, and whatever else was in the city or out in the fields. 
GEN.34.29	 They carried off all the wealth and all the women and children and looted everything in the houses.
GEN.34.30	 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have caused me a lot of trouble! You’ve made the people living in the area, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, hate me. There are only a few of us. If they join forces against me and attack me, my family and I will be wiped out.”
GEN.34.31	 Simeon and Levi asked, “Should Shechem have been allowed to treat our sister like a prostitute?”
GEN.35.1	 Then God said to Jacob, “Go to Bethel and live there. Make an altar there. I am the God who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.”
GEN.35.2	 So Jacob said to his family and those who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods which you have, wash yourselves until you are ritually clean,
GEN.35.3	 Then let’s go to Bethel. I will make an altar there to God, who answered me when I was troubled and who has been with me wherever I’ve gone.” 
GEN.35.4	 So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods that they had in their possession as well as the earrings that they had on. Jacob buried these things under the oak tree near Shechem.
GEN.35.5	 As they moved on, God made the people of the cities that were all around them terrified so that no one pursued them. 
GEN.35.6	 Jacob and all the people who were with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.35.7	 He built an altar there and called that place El Bethel [God of the House of God]. That’s where God had revealed himself to Jacob when he was fleeing from his brother. 
GEN.35.8	 Rebekah’s nurse Deborah died and was buried under the oak tree outside Bethel. So Jacob called it the Tree of Crying.
GEN.35.9	 Then God appeared once more to Jacob after he came back from Paddan Aram, and he blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	 God said to him, “Your name is Jacob. You will no longer be called Jacob, but your name will be Israel.” So he named him Israel.
GEN.35.11	 God also said to him, “I am God Almighty. Be fertile, and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from you. 
GEN.35.12	 I will give you the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac. I will also give this land to your descendants.” 
GEN.35.13	 Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him. 
GEN.35.14	 So Jacob set up a memorial, a stone marker, to mark the place where God had spoken with him. He poured a wine offering and olive oil on it. 
GEN.35.15	 Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him Bethel [House of God].
GEN.35.16	 Then they moved on from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor and was having severe labor pains. 
GEN.35.17	 During one of her pains, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid! You’re having another son!” 
GEN.35.18	 Rachel was dying. As she took her last breath, she named her son Benoni [Son of My Sorrow], but his father named him Benjamin [Son of My Right Hand].
GEN.35.19	 Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
GEN.35.20	 Then Jacob set up a stone as a marker for her grave. The same marker is at Rachel’s grave today.
GEN.35.21	 Israel moved on again and put up his tent beyond Migdal Eder. 
GEN.35.22	 While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went to bed with his father’s concubine 
GEN.35.22	Jacob had 12 sons.
GEN.35.23	 The sons of Leah were
GEN.35.23	Jacob’s firstborn Reuben, then Simeon,
GEN.35.23	Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
GEN.35.24	 The sons of Rachel were
GEN.35.24	Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.35.25	 The sons of Rachel’s slave Bilhah were
GEN.35.25	Dan and Naphtali.
GEN.35.26	 The sons of Leah’s slave Zilpah were
GEN.35.26	Gad and Asher.
GEN.35.26	These were Jacob’s sons, who were born in Paddan Aram.
GEN.35.27	 Jacob came home to his father Isaac to Mamre’s city, Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron). Abraham and Isaac had lived there for a while. 
GEN.35.28	 Isaac was 180 years old 
GEN.35.29	 when he took his last breath and died. He joined his ancestors in death at a very old age. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	 This is the account of Esau (that is, Edom) and his descendants. 
GEN.36.2	 Esau chose his wives from the women of Canaan: Adah, daughter of Elon the Hittite; Oholibamah, daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
GEN.36.3	 also Basemath, daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. 
GEN.36.4	 Adah gave birth to Eliphaz for Esau, and Basemath gave birth to Reuel. 
GEN.36.5	 Oholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born in Canaan.
GEN.36.6	 Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, all the members of his household, his possessions, all his cattle, and everything he had accumulated in Canaan and went to another land away from his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	 He did this because they had too many possessions to live together. There wasn’t enough pastureland for all of their livestock. 
GEN.36.8	 So Esau, who was also known as Edom, lived in the mountains of Seir.
GEN.36.9	 This is the account of Esau and his descendants. He was the father of the people of Edom in the mountains of Seir.
GEN.36.10	 These were the names of Esau’s sons:
GEN.36.10	Eliphaz, son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel, son of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.11	 The sons of Eliphaz were
GEN.36.11	Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 
GEN.36.12	 Timna was a concubine 
GEN.36.13	 These were Reuel’s sons:
GEN.36.13	Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.14	 These were the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah, daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon. She gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah for Esau.
GEN.36.15	 These were the tribal leaders among Esau’s descendants:
GEN.36.15	The sons of Eliphaz, Esau’s firstborn, were
GEN.36.15	Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	 Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These were the tribal leaders descended from Eliphaz in Edom. They were the grandsons of Adah.
GEN.36.17	 These were the tribal leaders among the descendants of Esau’s son Reuel:
GEN.36.17	Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the tribal leaders descended from Reuel in Edom. They were the grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.18	 These were the tribal leaders among the descendants of Esau’s wife Oholibamah:
GEN.36.18	Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the tribal leaders descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah, Anah’s daughter.
GEN.36.19	 These were the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom), who were tribal leaders.
GEN.36.20	 These were the sons of Seir the Horite, the people living in that land:
GEN.36.20	Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.21	 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These Horite tribal leaders were the sons of Seir in Edom.
GEN.36.22	 The sons of Lotan were
GEN.36.22	Hori and Hemam. Lotan’s sister was Timna.
GEN.36.23	 These were the sons of Shobal:
GEN.36.23	Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
GEN.36.24	 These were the sons of Zibeon:
GEN.36.24	Aiah and Anah. (Anah found the hot springs 
GEN.36.25	 These were the children of Anah:
GEN.36.25	Dishon and Oholibamah, daughter of Anah.
GEN.36.26	 These were the sons of Dishon:
GEN.36.26	Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
GEN.36.27	 These were the sons of Ezer:
GEN.36.27	Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
GEN.36.28	 These were the sons of Dishan:
GEN.36.28	Uz and Aran.
GEN.36.29	 These were the Horite tribal leaders:
GEN.36.29	Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.30	 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the Horite tribal leaders in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.31	 These were the kings who ruled Edom before any king ruled the people of Israel:
GEN.36.32	 Bela, son of Beor, ruled Edom. The name of his ⌊capital⌋ city was Dinhabah.
GEN.36.33	 After Bela died, Jobab, son of Zerah from Bozrah, succeeded him as king.
GEN.36.34	 After Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king.
GEN.36.35	 After Husham died, Hadad, son of Bedad succeeded him as king. Hadad defeated the Midianites in the country of Moab. The name of his capital city was Avith.
GEN.36.36	 After Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah succeeded him as king.
GEN.36.37	 After Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the river succeeded him as king.
GEN.36.38	 After Shaul died, Baal Hanan, son of Achbor, succeeded him as king.
GEN.36.39	 After Baal Hanan, son of Achbor, died, Hadar succeeded him as king, and the name of his capital city was Pau. His wife’s name was Mehetabel, daughter of Matred and granddaughter of Mezahab.
GEN.36.40	 These were the names of the tribal leaders descended from Esau, by family, place, and name:
GEN.36.40	Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 
GEN.36.41	 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	 Magdiel, and Iram.
GEN.36.43	These were the tribal leaders of Edom listed by the places where they lived and the property they owned.
GEN.36.43	Esau was the father of the people of Edom.
GEN.37.1	 Jacob continued to live in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived.
GEN.37.2	 This is the account of Jacob and his descendants.
GEN.37.2	Joseph was a seventeen-year-old young man. He took care of the flocks with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph told his father about the bad things his brothers were doing.
GEN.37.3	 Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because Joseph had been born in Israel’s old age. So he made Joseph a special robe with long sleeves. 
GEN.37.4	 Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them. They hated Joseph and couldn’t speak to him on friendly terms.
GEN.37.5	 Joseph had a dream and when he told his brothers, they hated him even more. 
GEN.37.6	 He said to them, “Please listen to the dream I had. 
GEN.37.7	 We were tying grain into bundles out in the field, and suddenly mine stood up. It remained standing while your bundles gathered around my bundle and bowed down to it.”
GEN.37.8	 Then his brothers asked him, “Are you going to be our king or rule us?” They hated him even more for his dreams and his words.
GEN.37.9	 Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream: I saw the sun, the moon, and 11 stars bowing down to me.”
GEN.37.10	 When he told his father and his brothers, his father criticized him by asking, “What’s this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers come and bow down in front of you?” 
GEN.37.11	 So his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept thinking about these things.
GEN.37.12	 His brothers had gone to take care of their father’s flocks at Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	 Israel then said to Joseph, “Your brothers are taking care of the flocks at Shechem. I’m going to send you to them.”
GEN.37.13	Joseph responded, “I’ll go.”
GEN.37.14	 So Israel said, “See how your brothers and the flocks are doing, and bring some news back to me.” Then he sent Joseph away from the Hebron Valley.
GEN.37.14	When Joseph came to Shechem, 
GEN.37.15	 a man found him wandering around in the open country. “What are you looking for?” the man asked.
GEN.37.16	 Joseph replied, “I’m looking for my brothers. Please tell me where they’re taking care of their flocks.”
GEN.37.17	 The man said, “They moved on from here. I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
GEN.37.18	 They saw him from a distance. Before he reached them, they plotted to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	 They said to each other, “Look, here comes that master dreamer! 
GEN.37.20	 Let’s kill him, throw him into one of the cisterns, and say that a wild animal has eaten him. Then we’ll see what happens to his dreams.”
GEN.37.21	 When Reuben heard this, he tried to save Joseph from their plot. “Let’s not kill him,” he said. 
GEN.37.22	 “Let’s not have any bloodshed. Put him into that cistern that’s out in the desert, but don’t hurt him.” Reuben wanted to rescue Joseph from them and bring him back to his father.
GEN.37.23	 So when Joseph reached his brothers, they stripped him of his special robe with long sleeves. 
GEN.37.24	 Then they took him and put him into an empty cistern. It had no water in it.
GEN.37.25	 As they sat down to eat, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying the materials for cosmetics, medicine, and embalming. They were on their way to take them to Egypt.
GEN.37.26	 Judah asked his brothers, “What will we gain by killing our brother and covering up his death? 
GEN.37.27	 Let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites. Let’s not hurt him, because he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” His brothers agreed.
GEN.37.28	 As the Midianite merchants were passing by, the brothers pulled Joseph out of the cistern. They sold him to the Ishmaelites for eight ounces of silver. The Ishmaelites took him to Egypt.
GEN.37.29	 When Reuben came back to the cistern and saw that Joseph was no longer there, he tore his clothes in grief. 
GEN.37.30	 He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy isn’t there! What am I going to do?”
GEN.37.31	 So they took Joseph’s robe, killed a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood. 
GEN.37.32	 Then they brought the special robe with long sleeves to their father and said, “We found this. You better examine it to see whether it’s your son’s robe or not.”
GEN.37.33	 He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! A wild animal has eaten him! Joseph must have been torn to pieces!” 
GEN.37.34	 Then, to show his grief, Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth around his waist, and mourned for his son a long time. 
GEN.37.35	 All his other sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, “No, I will mourn for my son until I die.” This is how Joseph’s father cried over him.
GEN.37.36	 Meanwhile, in Egypt the Midianites sold Joseph to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials and captain of the guard.
GEN.38.1	 About that time Judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man from Adullam whose name was Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	 There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man whose name was Shua. He married her and slept with her. 
GEN.38.3	 She became pregnant and gave birth to a son named 
GEN.38.4	 She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son, whom she named Onan. 
GEN.38.5	 Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son, whom she named Shelah. He was born at Kezib.
GEN.38.6	 Judah chose a wife for his firstborn son Er. Her name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	 Er angered the L
GEN.38.8	 Then Judah said to Onan, “Go sleep with your brother’s widow. Do your duty for her as a brother-in-law, and produce a descendant for your brother.” 
GEN.38.9	 But Onan knew that the descendant wouldn’t belong to him, so whenever he slept with his brother’s widow, he wasted his semen on the ground to avoid giving his brother a descendant. 
GEN.38.10	 What Onan did angered the L
GEN.38.11	 Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Return to your father’s home. Live as a widow until my son Shelah grows up.” He thought that this son, too, might die like his brothers. So Tamar went to live in her father’s home.
GEN.38.12	 After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he and his friend Hirah from Adullam went to Timnah where the men were shearing Judah’s sheep. 
GEN.38.13	 As soon as Tamar was told that her father-in-law was on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep, 
GEN.38.14	 she took off her widow’s clothes, covered her face with a veil, and disguised herself. Then she sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. (She did this because she realized that Shelah was grown up now, and she hadn’t been given to him in marriage.)
GEN.38.15	 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face. 
GEN.38.16	 Since he didn’t know she was his daughter-in-law, he approached her by the roadside and said, “Come on, let’s sleep together!”
GEN.38.16	She asked, “What will you pay to sleep with me?”
GEN.38.17	 “I’ll send you a young goat from the flock,” he answered.
GEN.38.17	She said, “First give me something as a deposit until you send it.”
GEN.38.18	 “What should I give you as a deposit?” he asked.
GEN.38.18	“Your signet ring, its cord, and the shepherd’s staff that’s in your hand,” she answered.
GEN.38.18	So he gave them to her. Then he slept with her, and she became pregnant. 
GEN.38.19	 After she got up and left, she took off her veil and put her widow’s clothes back on.
GEN.38.20	 Judah sent his friend Hirah to deliver the young goat so that he could get back his deposit from the woman, but his friend couldn’t find her. 
GEN.38.21	 He asked the men of that area, “Where’s that prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?”
GEN.38.21	“There’s no prostitute here,” they answered.
GEN.38.22	 So he went back to Judah and said, “I couldn’t find her. Even the men of that area said, ‘There’s no prostitute here.’ ”
GEN.38.23	 Then Judah said, “Let her keep what I gave her, or we’ll become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you couldn’t find her.”
GEN.38.24	 About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has been acting like a prostitute. What’s more, because of it she’s pregnant.”
GEN.38.24	Judah ordered, “Bring her out to be burned.”
GEN.38.25	 As she was brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law, “I’m pregnant by the man who owns these things. See if you recognize whose signet ring, cord, and shepherd’s staff these are.”
GEN.38.26	 Judah recognized them and said, “She’s not guilty. I am! She did this because I haven’t given her my son Shelah.” Judah never made love to her again.
GEN.38.27	 The time came for Tamar to give birth, and she had twin boys. 
GEN.38.28	 When she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand. The midwife took a piece of red yarn, tied it on his wrist, and said, “This one came out first.” 
GEN.38.29	 As he pulled back his hand, his brother was born. So she said, “Is this how you burst into the world!” He was named Perez [Bursting Into]. 
GEN.38.30	 After that his brother was born with the red yarn on his hand. He was named Zerah [Sunrise].
GEN.39.1	 Joseph had been taken to Egypt. Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s Egyptian officials and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
GEN.39.2	 The L
GEN.39.3	 Joseph’s master saw that the L
GEN.39.4	 Potiphar liked Joseph so much that he made him his trusted servant. He put him in charge of his household and everything he owned. 
GEN.39.5	 From that time on the L
GEN.39.6	 So he left all that he owned in Joseph’s care. He wasn’t concerned about anything except the food he ate.
GEN.39.6	Joseph was well-built and handsome. 
GEN.39.7	 After a while his master’s wife began to desire Joseph, so she said, “Come to bed with me.”
GEN.39.8	 But Joseph refused and said to her, “My master doesn’t concern himself with anything in the house. He trusts me with everything he owns. 
GEN.39.9	 No one in this house is greater than I. He’s kept nothing back from me except you, because you’re his wife. How could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?” 
GEN.39.10	 Although she kept asking Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or be with her.
GEN.39.11	 One day he went into the house to do his work, and none of the household servants were there. 
GEN.39.12	 She grabbed him by his clothes and said, “Come to bed with me!” But he ran outside and left his clothes in her hand.
GEN.39.13	 When she realized that he had gone but had left his clothes behind, 
GEN.39.14	 she called her household servants and said to them, “Look! My husband brought this Hebrew here to fool around with us. He came in and tried to go to bed with me, but I screamed as loud as I could. 
GEN.39.15	 As soon as he heard me scream, he ran outside and left his clothes with me.”
GEN.39.16	 She kept Joseph’s clothes with her until his master came home. 
GEN.39.17	 Then she told him the same story: “The Hebrew slave you brought here came in and tried to fool around with me. 
GEN.39.18	 But when I screamed, he ran outside and left his clothes with me.”
GEN.39.19	 When Potiphar heard his wife’s story, especially when she said, “This is what your slave did to me,” he became very angry. 
GEN.39.20	 So Joseph’s master arrested him and put him in the same prison where the king’s prisoners were kept.
GEN.39.20	While Joseph was in prison, 
GEN.39.21	 the L
GEN.39.22	 So the warden placed Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in that prison. Joseph became responsible for everything that they were doing. 
GEN.39.23	 The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care because the L
GEN.40.1	 Later the king’s cupbearer 
GEN.40.2	 Pharaoh was angry with his chief cupbearer and his chief baker. 
GEN.40.3	 He put them in the prison of the captain of the guard, the same place where Joseph was a prisoner. 
GEN.40.4	 The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them.
GEN.40.4	After they had been confined for some time, 
GEN.40.5	 both prisoners—the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt—had dreams one night. Each man had a dream with its own special meaning.
GEN.40.6	 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were upset. 
GEN.40.7	 So he asked these officials of Pharaoh who were with him in his master’s prison, “Why do you look so unhappy today?”
GEN.40.8	 “We both had dreams,” they answered him, “but there’s no one to tell us what they mean.”
GEN.40.8	“Isn’t God the only one who can tell what they mean?” Joseph asked them. “Why don’t you tell me all about them.”
GEN.40.9	 So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said “In my dream a grapevine with three branches appeared in front of me. 
GEN.40.10	 Soon after it sprouted it blossomed. Then its clusters ripened into grapes. 
GEN.40.11	 Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, so I took the grapes and squeezed them into it. I put the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”
GEN.40.12	 “This is what it means,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days. 
GEN.40.13	 In the next three days Pharaoh will release you and restore you to your position. You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand as you used to do when you were his cupbearer. 
GEN.40.14	 Remember me when things go well for you, and please do me a favor. Mention me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this prison. 
GEN.40.15	 I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I’ve done nothing to deserve being put in this prison.”
GEN.40.16	 The chief baker saw that the meaning Joseph had given to the cupbearer’s dream was good. So he said to Joseph, “I had a dream too. In my dream three baskets of white baked goods were on my head. 
GEN.40.17	 The top basket contained all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”
GEN.40.18	 “This is what it means,” Joseph replied. “The three baskets are three days. 
GEN.40.19	 In the next three days Pharaoh will cut off your head and hang your dead body on a pole. The birds will eat the flesh from your bones.”
GEN.40.20	 Two days later, on his birthday, Pharaoh had a special dinner prepared for all his servants. Of all his servants he gave special attention to the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 
GEN.40.21	 He restored the chief cupbearer to his position. So the cupbearer put the cup in Pharaoh’s hand. 
GEN.40.22	 But he hung the chief baker just as Joseph had said in his interpretation.
GEN.40.23	 Nevertheless, the chief cupbearer didn’t remember Joseph. He forgot all about him.
GEN.41.1	 After two full years Pharaoh had a dream. He dreamed he was standing by the Nile River. 
GEN.41.2	 Suddenly, seven nice-looking, well-fed cows came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds. 
GEN.41.3	 Seven other cows came up from the river behind them. These cows were sickly and skinny. They stood behind the first seven cows on the riverbank. 
GEN.41.4	 The cows that were sickly and skinny ate the seven nice-looking, well-fed cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
GEN.41.5	 He fell asleep again and had a second dream. Seven good, healthy heads of grain were growing on a single stalk. 
GEN.41.6	 Seven other heads of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted behind them. 
GEN.41.7	 The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven full, healthy heads. Then Pharaoh woke up. It was only a dream.
GEN.41.8	 In the morning he was so upset that he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could tell him what they meant.
GEN.41.9	 Then the chief cupbearer 
GEN.41.10	 Some time ago when Pharaoh was angry with his servants, he confined me and the chief baker to the captain of the guard’s prison. 
GEN.41.11	 We both had dreams the same night. Each dream had its own meaning. 
GEN.41.12	 A young Hebrew, a slave of the captain of the guard, was with us. We told him our dreams, and he told each of us what they meant. 
GEN.41.13	 What he told us happened: Pharaoh restored me to my position, but he hung the baker on a pole.”
GEN.41.14	 Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and immediately he was brought from the prison. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came in front of Pharaoh.
GEN.41.15	 Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can tell me what it means. I heard that when you are told a dream, you can say what it means.”
GEN.41.16	 Joseph answered Pharaoh, “I can’t, but God can give Pharaoh the answer that he needs.”
GEN.41.17	 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile. 
GEN.41.18	 Suddenly, seven nice-looking, well-fed cows came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds. 
GEN.41.19	 Seven other cows came up behind them. These cows were scrawny, very sick, and thin. I’ve never seen such sickly cows in all of Egypt! 
GEN.41.20	 The thin, sickly cows ate up the seven well-fed ones. 
GEN.41.21	 Even though they had eaten them, no one could tell they had eaten them. They looked just as sick as before. Then I woke up.
GEN.41.22	 “In my second dream I saw seven good, full heads of grain growing on a single stalk. 
GEN.41.23	 Seven other heads of grain, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted behind them. 
GEN.41.24	 The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but no one could tell me what it meant.”
GEN.41.25	 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh had the same dream twice. God has told Pharaoh what he’s going to do. 
GEN.41.26	 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. It’s all the same dream. 
GEN.41.27	 The seven thin, sickly cows that came up behind them are seven years. The seven empty heads of grain scorched by the east wind are also seven years. Seven years of famine are coming.
GEN.41.28	 “It’s just as I said to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he’s going to do. 
GEN.41.29	 Seven years are coming when there will be plenty of food in Egypt. 
GEN.41.30	 After them will come seven years of famine. People will forget that there was plenty of food in Egypt, and the famine will ruin the land. 
GEN.41.31	 People won’t remember that there once was plenty of food in the land, because the coming famine will be so severe. 
GEN.41.32	 The reason Pharaoh has had a recurring dream is because the matter has been definitely decided by God, and he will do it very soon.
GEN.41.33	 “Pharaoh should look for a wise and intelligent man and put him in charge of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	 Make arrangements to appoint supervisors over the land to take a fifth of Egypt’s harvest during the seven good years. 
GEN.41.35	 Have them collect all the food during these good years and store up grain under Pharaoh’s control, to be kept for food in the cities. 
GEN.41.36	 This food will be a reserve supply for our country during the seven years of famine that will happen in Egypt. Then the land will not be ruined by the famine.”
GEN.41.37	 Pharaoh and all his servants liked the idea. 
GEN.41.38	 So Pharaoh asked his servants, “Can we find anyone like this—a man who has God’s Spirit in him?”
GEN.41.39	 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has let you know all this, there is no one as wise and intelligent as you. 
GEN.41.40	 You will be in charge of my palace, and all my people will do 
GEN.41.41	 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I now put you in charge of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	 Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring and put it on Joseph’s finger. He had Joseph dressed in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. 
GEN.41.43	 He had him ride in the chariot of the second-in-command. Men ran ahead of him and shouted, “Make way!”
GEN.41.44	 He also said to Joseph, “Even though I am Pharaoh, no one anywhere in Egypt will do anything without your permission.” 
GEN.41.45	 Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenathpaneah and gave him Asenath as his wife. She was the daughter of Potiphera, priest from the city of On. Joseph traveled around Egypt.
GEN.41.46	 Joseph was 30 years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh (the king of Egypt). He left Pharaoh and traveled all around Egypt. 
GEN.41.47	 During the seven good years the land produced large harvests. 
GEN.41.48	 Joseph collected all the food grown in Egypt during those seven years and put this food in the cities. In each city he put the food from the fields around it. 
GEN.41.49	 Joseph stored up grain in huge quantities like the sand on the seashore. He had so much that he finally gave up keeping any records because he couldn’t measure it all.
GEN.41.50	 Before the years of famine came, Joseph had two sons by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest from the city of On. 
GEN.41.51	 Joseph named his firstborn son Manasseh [He Helps Me Forget], because God helped him forget all his troubles and all about his father’s family. 
GEN.41.52	 He named the second son Ephraim [Blessed Twice With Children], because God gave him children in the land where he had suffered.
GEN.41.53	 The seven years when there was plenty of food in Egypt came to an end. 
GEN.41.54	 Then the seven years of famine began as Joseph had said they would. All the other countries were experiencing famine. Yet, there was food in Egypt. 
GEN.41.55	 When everyone in Egypt began to feel the effects of the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. But Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph! Do what he tells you!”
GEN.41.56	 When the famine had spread all over the country, Joseph opened all the storehouses 
GEN.41.57	 The whole world came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, since the famine was so severe all over the world.
GEN.42.1	 When Jacob found out that grain was for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you keep looking at each other? 
GEN.42.2	 I’ve heard there’s grain for sale in Egypt. Go there and buy some for us so that we won’t starve to death.”
GEN.42.3	 Ten of Joseph’s brothers went to buy grain in Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	 Jacob wouldn’t send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with the other brothers, because he was afraid that something would happen to him. 
GEN.42.5	 Israel’s sons left with the others who were going to buy grain, because there was also famine in Canaan.
GEN.42.6	 As governor of the country, Joseph was selling grain to everyone. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed in front of him with their faces touching the ground. 
GEN.42.7	 As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them. But he acted as if he didn’t know them and spoke harshly to them. “Where did you come from?” he asked them.
GEN.42.7	“From Canaan, to buy food,” they answered.
GEN.42.8	 Even though Joseph recognized his brothers, they didn’t recognize him. 
GEN.42.9	 Then he remembered the dreams he once had about them. “You’re spies!” he said to them, “And you’ve come to find out where our country is unprotected.”
GEN.42.10	 “No, sir!” they answered him. “We’ve come to buy food. 
GEN.42.11	 We’re all sons of one man. We’re honest men, not spies.”
GEN.42.12	 He said to them, “No! You’ve come to find out where our country is unprotected.”
GEN.42.13	 They answered him, “We were 12 brothers, sons of one man in Canaan. The youngest brother stayed with our father, and the other one is no longer with us.”
GEN.42.14	 “It’s just as I told you,” Joseph said to them. “You’re spies! 
GEN.42.15	 This is how you’ll be tested: I solemnly swear, as surely as Pharaoh lives, that you won’t leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. 
GEN.42.16	 One of you must be sent to get your brother while the rest of you stay in prison. We’ll see if you’re telling the truth. If not, I solemnly swear, as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!” 
GEN.42.17	 Then he put them in jail for three days.
GEN.42.18	 On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this, and you will live. I, too, fear God. 
GEN.42.19	 If you are honest men, you will let one of your brothers stay here in prison. The rest of you will go and take grain back to your starving families. 
GEN.42.20	 But you must bring me your youngest brother. This will show that you’ve been telling the truth. Then you won’t die.” So they agreed.
GEN.42.21	 They said to each other, “We’re surely being punished for what we did to our brother. We saw how troubled he was when he pleaded with us for mercy, but we wouldn’t listen. That’s why we’re in trouble now.”
GEN.42.22	 Reuben said to them, “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn’t listen. Now we must pay for this bloodshed.”
GEN.42.23	 They didn’t know that Joseph could understand them, because he was speaking through an interpreter. 
GEN.42.24	 He stepped away from them to cry. When he could speak to them again, he came back. Then he picked Simeon and had him arrested right in front of their eyes.
GEN.42.25	 Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain. He put each man’s money back into his sack and gave them supplies for their trip. After their bags were filled, 
GEN.42.26	 they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
GEN.42.27	 At the place where they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey. His money was right inside his sack. 
GEN.42.28	 He said to his brothers, “My money has been put back! It’s right here in my sack!”
GEN.42.28	They wanted to die. They trembled and turned to each other and asked, “What has God done to us?”
GEN.42.29	 When they came to their father Jacob in Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said, 
GEN.42.30	 “The governor of that land spoke harshly to us and treated us like spies. 
GEN.42.31	 But we said to him, ‘We’re honest men, not spies. 
GEN.42.32	 We were 12 brothers, sons of the same father. One is no longer with us. The youngest brother stayed with our father in Canaan.’
GEN.42.33	 “Then the governor of that land said to us, ‘This is how I’ll know that you’re honest men: Leave one of your brothers with me. Take food for your starving families and go. 
GEN.42.34	 But bring me your youngest brother. Then I’ll know that you’re not spies but honest men. I’ll give your brother back to you, and you’ll be able to move about freely in this country.’ ”
GEN.42.35	 As they were emptying their sacks, each man found his bag of money in his sack. When they and their father saw the bags of money, they were frightened. 
GEN.42.36	 Their father Jacob said to them, “You’re going to make me lose all my children! Joseph is no longer with us, Simeon is no longer with us, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything’s against me!”
GEN.42.37	 So Reuben said to his father, “You may put my two sons to death if I don’t bring him back to you. Let me take care of him, and I’ll bring him back to you.”
GEN.42.38	 Jacob replied, “My son will not go with you. His brother is dead, and he’s the only one left. If any harm comes to him on the trip you’re taking, the grief would drive this gray-haired old man to his grave!”
GEN.43.1	 The famine was severe in the land. 
GEN.43.2	 When they finished eating the grain they had brought from Egypt, Israel said to his sons, “Go back and buy us a little more food.”
GEN.43.3	 Judah said to him, “The man gave us a severe warning: ‘You won’t be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you.’ 
GEN.43.4	 If you let our brother go with us, we’ll go and buy food for you. 
GEN.43.5	 If you won’t let him go, we won’t go. The man said to us, ‘You won’t be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you.’ ”
GEN.43.6	 Israel asked, “Why have you made trouble for me by telling the man you had another brother?”
GEN.43.7	 They answered, “The man kept asking about us and our family: ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ We simply answered his questions. How could we possibly know he would say, ‘Bring your brother here’?”
GEN.43.8	 Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy along with me. Let’s get going so that we won’t starve to death. 
GEN.43.9	 I guarantee that he will come back. You can hold me responsible for him. If I don’t bring him back to you and place him here in front of you, you can blame me the rest of my life. 
GEN.43.10	 If we hadn’t waited so long, we could have made this trip twice by now.”
GEN.43.11	 Then their father Israel said to them, “If that’s the way it has to be, then take the man a gift. Put some of the best products of the land in your bags. Take a little balm, a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 
GEN.43.12	 Take twice as much money with you. You must return the money that was put back in your sacks. Maybe it was a mistake. 
GEN.43.13	 Take your brother, and go back to the man. 
GEN.43.14	 May God Almighty make him merciful to you so that he will send your other brother and Benjamin ⌊home⌋ with you. If I lose my children, I lose my children.”
GEN.43.15	 The men took the gifts, twice as much money, and Benjamin. They went to Egypt, where they presented themselves to Joseph.
GEN.43.16	 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the man in charge of his house, “Take these men to my house. Butcher an animal, and prepare a meal, because they are going to eat with me at noon.”
GEN.43.17	 So the man did as Joseph said and took them to Joseph’s house. 
GEN.43.18	 The men were frightened, because they had been brought to Joseph’s house. They thought, “We’ve been brought here because of the money that was put back into our sacks the first time. They’re going to attack us, overpower us, take our donkeys, and make us slaves.”
GEN.43.19	 So they came to the man in charge of Joseph’s house and spoke to him at the door. 
GEN.43.20	 “Please, sir,” they said, “we came here to buy food once before. 
GEN.43.21	 When we stopped for the night, we opened our sacks, and each man found all of his money inside. So we brought it back with us. 
GEN.43.22	 We also brought more money to buy food. We have no idea who put our money back in our sacks.”
GEN.43.23	 “It’s alright,” he said. “Don’t be afraid! Your God, the God of your father, must have given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
GEN.43.24	 The man took the brothers into Joseph’s house. He gave them water to wash their feet and feed for their donkeys. 
GEN.43.25	 They got their gifts ready for Joseph’s return at noon, because they had heard they were going to eat there.
GEN.43.26	 When Joseph came home, they gave him the gifts they had brought to the house. Then they bowed to him with their faces touching the ground. 
GEN.43.27	 He asked them how they were. Then he said, “You told me about your elderly father. How is he? Is he still alive?”
GEN.43.28	 They answered, “Yes, sir. Our father is alive and well.” Then they knelt, bowing down.
GEN.43.29	 As Joseph looked around, he saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son. “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” he asked. “God be gracious to you, my son,” he said. 
GEN.43.30	 Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, he hurried away, looking for a place to cry. He went into his private room and cried there.
GEN.43.31	 Then he washed his face and came out. He was in control of his emotions when he said, “Serve the food.”
GEN.43.32	 He was served separately from his brothers. The Egyptians who were there with him were also served separately, because they found it offensive to eat with Hebrews. 
GEN.43.33	 The brothers were seated facing him according to their ages—from the oldest to the youngest. They looked at each other in amazement.
GEN.43.34	 Joseph had portions of food brought to them from his table, but Benjamin’s portion was five times more than any of the others. So they ate and drank with Joseph until they were drunk.
GEN.44.1	 Joseph commanded the man in charge of his house, “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry. Put each man’s money in his sack. 
GEN.44.2	 Then put my silver cup in the youngest brother’s sack along with the money for his grain.” He did what Joseph told him.
GEN.44.3	 At dawn the men were sent on their way with their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	 They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to the man in charge of his house, “Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, ‘Why have you paid me back with evil when I was good to you? 
GEN.44.5	 Isn’t this the cup that my master drinks from and that he uses for telling the future? What you have done is evil!’ ”
GEN.44.6	 When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them. 
GEN.44.7	 They answered him, “Sir, how can you say such things? We would never think of doing anything like that! 
GEN.44.8	 We brought the money we found in our sacks back from Canaan. So why would we steal any silver or gold from your master’s house? 
GEN.44.9	 If one of us has it, he will die, and the rest of us will become your slaves.”
GEN.44.10	 “I agree,” he said. “We’ll do what you’ve said. The man who has the cup will be my slave, and the rest of you can go free.”
GEN.44.11	 Each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it. 
GEN.44.12	 Then the man made a thorough search. He began with the oldest and ended with the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
GEN.44.13	 When they saw this, they tore their clothes in grief. Then each one loaded his donkey and went back into the city.
GEN.44.14	 Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph’s house while Joseph was still there. Immediately, they bowed with their faces touching the ground. 
GEN.44.15	 Joseph asked them, “What have you done? Don’t you know that a man like me can find things out because he knows the future?”
GEN.44.16	 “Sir, what can we say to you?” Judah asked. “How else can we explain it? How can we prove we’re innocent? God has uncovered our guilt. Now all of us are your slaves, including the one who had the cup.”
GEN.44.17	 But Joseph said, “I would never think of doing that! Only the man who had the cup will be my slave. The rest of you can go back to your father in peace.”
GEN.44.18	 Then Judah went up to Joseph and said, “Please, sir, let me speak openly with you. Don’t be angry with me, although you are equal to Pharaoh. 
GEN.44.19	 Sir, you asked us, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	 We answered, ‘We have a father who is old and a younger brother born to him when he was already old. The boy’s brother is dead, so he’s the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’
GEN.44.21	 “Then you said to us, ‘Bring him here to me so that I can see him myself.’ 
GEN.44.22	 We replied, ‘The boy can’t leave his father. If the boy leaves him, his father will die.’ 
GEN.44.23	 Then you told us, ‘If your youngest brother doesn’t come here with you, you will never be allowed to see me again.’ 
GEN.44.24	 When we went back to our father, we told him what you had said.
GEN.44.25	 “Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy us a little more food.’ 
GEN.44.26	 We answered, ‘We can’t go back. We can only go back if our youngest brother is with us. The man won’t see us unless our youngest brother is with us.’
GEN.44.27	 “Then our father said to us, ‘You know that my wife ⌊Rachel⌋ gave me two sons. 
GEN.44.28	 One is gone, and I said, “He must have been torn to pieces!” I haven’t seen him since. 
GEN.44.29	 If you take this one away from me too and anything happens to him, you’ll drive this gray-haired old man to his grave.’
GEN.44.30	 “Our father’s life is wrapped up with the boy’s life. If I come ⌊home⌋ without the boy 
GEN.44.31	 and he sees that the boy isn’t ⌊with me⌋, he’ll die. The grief would drive our gray-haired old father to his grave.
GEN.44.32	 “I guaranteed my father that the boy would come back. I said, ‘If I don’t bring him back to you, then you can blame me the rest of my life, Father.’ 
GEN.44.33	 Sir, please let me stay and be your slave in the boy’s place, and let the boy go back with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	 How could I go back to my father if the boy isn’t with me? I couldn’t bear to see my father’s misery!”
GEN.45.1	 Joseph could no longer control his emotions in front of everyone who was standing around him, so he cried out, “Have everyone leave me!” No one else was there when Joseph told his brothers who he was. 
GEN.45.2	 He cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh’s household heard about it.
GEN.45.3	 Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” His brothers could not answer him because they were afraid of him.
GEN.45.4	 “Please come closer to me,” Joseph said to his brothers. When they did so, he said, “I am Joseph, the brother you sold into slavery in Egypt! 
GEN.45.5	 Now, don’t be sad or angry with yourselves that you sold me. God sent me ahead of you to save lives. 
GEN.45.6	 The famine has been in the land for two years. There will be five more years without plowing or harvesting. 
GEN.45.7	 God sent me ahead of you to make sure that you would have descendants on the earth and to save your lives in an amazing way. 
GEN.45.8	 It wasn’t you who sent me here, but God. He has made me ⌊like⌋ a father to Pharaoh, lord over his entire household, and ruler of Egypt.
GEN.45.9	 “Hurry back to my father, and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says, “God has made me lord of Egypt. Come here to me right away! 
GEN.45.10	 Live in the land of Goshen, where you will be near me. Live there with your children and your grandchildren, as well as your flocks, your herds, and everything you have. 
GEN.45.11	 I will provide for you in Egypt, since there will be five more years of famine. Then you, your family, and all who belong to you won’t lose everything.” ’
GEN.45.12	 “You and my brother Benjamin can see for yourselves that I am the one who is speaking to you. 
GEN.45.13	 Tell my father how greatly honored I am in Egypt and about everything you have seen. Hurry and bring my father here!”
GEN.45.14	 He threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and cried with Benjamin, who was crying on his shoulder. 
GEN.45.15	 He kissed all his brothers and cried with them. After that his brothers talked with him.
GEN.45.16	 When Pharaoh’s household heard the news that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and his officials were pleased. 
GEN.45.17	 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Load up your animals, and go back to Canaan. 
GEN.45.18	 Take your father and your families, and come to me. I will give you the best land in Egypt. Then you can enjoy the best food in the land.’
GEN.45.19	 “Give them this order: ‘Take wagons with you from Egypt for your children and your wives. Bring your father, and come back. 
GEN.45.20	 Don’t worry about your belongings because the best of everything in Egypt is yours.’ ”
GEN.45.21	 Israel’s sons did as they were told. Joseph gave them wagons and supplies for their trip as Pharaoh had ordered. 
GEN.45.22	 He gave each of them a change of clothes, but he gave Benjamin three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothes. 
GEN.45.23	 He sent his father ten male donkeys carrying Egypt’s best products and ten female donkeys carrying grain, bread, and food for his father’s trip. 
GEN.45.24	 So Joseph sent his brothers on their way. As they were leaving, he said to them, “Don’t quarrel on your way back!”
GEN.45.25	 So they left Egypt and came to their father Jacob in Canaan. 
GEN.45.26	 They told him, “Joseph is still alive! Yes, he is ruler of Egypt.” Jacob was stunned and didn’t believe them. 
GEN.45.27	 Yet, when they told their father everything Joseph had said to them and he saw the wagons Joseph had sent to bring him back, his spirits were lifted.
GEN.45.28	 “You have convinced me!” Israel said. “My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	 Israel moved with all he had. When he came to Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
GEN.46.2	 God spoke to Israel in a vision that night and said, “Jacob, Jacob!”
GEN.46.2	“Here I am,” he answered.
GEN.46.3	 “I am God, the God of your father,” he said. “Don’t be afraid to go to Egypt, because I will make you a great nation there. 
GEN.46.4	 I will go with you to Egypt, and I will make sure you come back again. Joseph will close your eyes ⌊when you die⌋.”
GEN.46.5	 So Jacob left Beersheba. Israel’s sons put their father Jacob, their children, and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to bring him back. 
GEN.46.6	 They also took their livestock and the possessions they had accumulated in Canaan.
GEN.46.6	Jacob and all his family arrived in Egypt. 
GEN.46.7	 He had brought his sons, his grandsons, his daughters, and his granddaughters—his entire family.
GEN.46.8	 These are the names of Israel’s descendants (Jacob and his descendants) who arrived in Egypt.
GEN.46.8	Reuben was Jacob’s firstborn.
GEN.46.9	 The sons of Reuben were
GEN.46.9	Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
GEN.46.10	 The sons of Simeon were
GEN.46.10	Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
GEN.46.11	 The sons of Levi were
GEN.46.11	Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
GEN.46.12	 The sons of Judah were
GEN.46.12	Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. (Er and Onan had died in Canaan.)
GEN.46.12	The sons of Perez were
GEN.46.12	Hezron and Hamul.
GEN.46.13	 The sons of Issachar were
GEN.46.13	Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron.
GEN.46.14	 The sons of Zebulun were
GEN.46.14	Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
GEN.46.15	 These were the descendants of the sons Leah gave to Jacob in Paddan Aram, in addition to his daughter Dinah. The total number of these sons and daughters was 33.
GEN.46.16	 The sons of Gad were
GEN.46.16	Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
GEN.46.17	 The sons of Asher were
GEN.46.17	Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah. Their sister was Serah.
GEN.46.17	The sons of Beriah were
GEN.46.17	Heber and Malchiel.
GEN.46.18	 These were the descendants of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. She gave birth to these children for Jacob. The total was 16.
GEN.46.19	 The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel were
GEN.46.19	Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.46.20	 In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest from the city of On.
GEN.46.21	 The sons of Benjamin were Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
GEN.46.22	 These were the descendants of Rachel who were born to Jacob. The total was 14.
GEN.46.23	 The son of Dan was
GEN.46.23	Hushim.
GEN.46.24	 The sons of Naphtali were
GEN.46.24	Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
GEN.46.25	 These were the descendants of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. She gave birth to these sons for Jacob. The total was 7.
GEN.46.26	 The total number of Jacob’s direct descendants who went with him to Egypt was 66. This didn’t include the wives of Jacob’s sons. 
GEN.46.27	 Joseph had two sons who were born in Egypt. The grand total of people in Jacob’s household who went to Egypt was 70.
GEN.46.28	 Israel sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When Israel’s family arrived in the region of Goshen, 
GEN.46.29	 Joseph prepared his chariot and went to meet his father Israel. As soon as he saw his father, he threw his arms around him and cried on his shoulder a long time.
GEN.46.30	 Israel said to Joseph, “Now that I’ve seen for myself that you’re still alive, I’m ready to die.”
GEN.46.31	 Then Joseph said to his brothers and his father’s family, “I’m going to Pharaoh to tell him, ‘My brothers and my father’s family, who were in Canaan, have come to me. 
GEN.46.32	 The men are shepherds. They take care of livestock. They’ve brought their flocks and herds and everything they own.’ 
GEN.46.33	 Now, when Pharaoh calls for you and asks, ‘What kind of work do you do?’ 
GEN.46.34	 you must answer, ‘We have taken care of herds all our lives, as our ancestors have done.’ ⌊You must say this⌋ so that you may live in the region of Goshen, because all shepherds are disgusting to Egyptians.”
GEN.47.1	 Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers have arrived from Canaan with their flocks, herds, and everything they have. Now they are in Goshen.” 
GEN.47.2	 Since he had taken five of his brothers with him, he presented them to Pharaoh.
GEN.47.3	 Pharaoh asked the brothers, “What kind of work do you do?”
GEN.47.3	They answered Pharaoh, “We are shepherds, as were our ancestors. 
GEN.47.4	 We have come to live in this land for a while. The famine is so severe in Canaan that there’s no pasture for our flocks. So please let us live in Goshen.”
GEN.47.5	 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
GEN.47.6	 All of Egypt is available to you. Have your father and your brothers live in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. If they are qualified, put them in charge of my livestock.”
GEN.47.7	 Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and had him stand in front of Pharaoh. Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.8	 Pharaoh asked him, “How old are you?”
GEN.47.9	 Jacob answered Pharaoh, “The length of my stay on earth has been 130 years. The years of my life have been few and difficult, fewer than my ancestors’ years.” 
GEN.47.10	 Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and left.
GEN.47.11	 As Pharaoh had ordered, Joseph had his father and his brothers live in the best part of Egypt, the region of Rameses. He gave them property there. 
GEN.47.12	 Joseph also provided his father, his brothers, and all his father’s family with food based on the number of children they had.
GEN.47.13	 The famine was so severe that there was no food anywhere. Neither Egypt nor Canaan were producing crops because of the famine. 
GEN.47.14	 Joseph collected all the money that could be found in Egypt and in Canaan as payment for the grain people bought. Then he took it to Pharaoh’s palace. 
GEN.47.15	 When the money in Egypt and Canaan was gone, all the Egyptians came to Joseph. “Give us food,” they said. “Do you want us to die right in front of you? We don’t have any more money!”
GEN.47.16	 Joseph replied, “If you don’t have any more money, give me your livestock, and I’ll give you food 
GEN.47.17	 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys. During that year he supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock.
GEN.47.18	 When that year was over, they came to him the next year. “Sir,” they said to him, “you know that our money is gone, and you have all our livestock. There’s nothing left to bring you except our bodies and our land. 
GEN.47.19	 Do you want us to die right in front of you? Do you want the land to be ruined? Take us and our land in exchange for food. Then we will be Pharaoh’s slaves and our land will be his property. But give us seed so that we won’t starve to death and the ground won’t become a desert.”
GEN.47.20	 Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. Every Egyptian sold his fields because the famine was so severe. The land became Pharaoh’s. 
GEN.47.21	 All over Egypt Joseph moved the people to the cities. 
GEN.47.22	 But he didn’t buy the priests’ land because the priests received an income from Pharaoh, and they lived on that income. That’s why they didn’t sell their land.
GEN.47.23	 Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you. Plant crops in the land. 
GEN.47.24	 Every time you harvest, give one-fifth of the produce to Pharaoh. Four-fifths will be yours to use as seed for your fields and as food for your households.”
GEN.47.25	 “You have saved our lives,” they said. “Please, sir, we are willing to be Pharaoh’s slaves.”
GEN.47.26	 Joseph made a law concerning the land in Egypt which is still in force today: One-fifth ⌊of the produce⌋ belongs to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests didn’t belong to Pharaoh.
GEN.47.27	 So the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and had many children.
GEN.47.28	 Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years, so he lived a total of 147 years. 
GEN.47.29	 Israel was about to die. He called for his son Joseph and said to him, “I want you to swear that you love me and are faithful to me. Please don’t bury me here. 
GEN.47.30	 I want to rest with my ancestors. Take me out of Egypt, and bury me in their tomb.”
GEN.47.30	“I will do as you say,” Joseph answered.
GEN.47.31	 “Swear to me,” he said. So Joseph swore to him. Then Israel bowed down in prayer with his face at the head of his bed.
GEN.48.1	 Later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim ⌊to see Jacob⌋. 
GEN.48.2	 When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph is here to see you,” Israel gathered his strength and sat up in bed.
GEN.48.3	 Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in Canaan and blessed me. 
GEN.48.4	 He said to me, ‘I will make you fertile and increase the number of your descendants so that you will become a community of people. I will give this land to your descendants as a permanent possession.’
GEN.48.5	 “So your two sons, who were born in Egypt before I came here, are my sons. Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine just as Reuben and Simeon are. 
GEN.48.6	 Any other children you have after them will be yours. They will inherit the land listed under their brothers’ names. 
GEN.48.7	 As I was coming back from Paddan, Rachel died in Canaan when we were still some distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there on the way to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem).
GEN.48.8	 When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he asked, “Who are they?”
GEN.48.9	 “They are my sons, whom God has given me here in Egypt,” Joseph answered his father.
GEN.48.9	Then Israel said, “Please bring them to me so that I may bless them.”
GEN.48.10	 Israel’s eyesight was failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to his father, and Israel hugged them and kissed them.
GEN.48.11	 Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see you again, and now God has even let me see your sons.”
GEN.48.12	 Joseph took them off his father’s lap and bowed with his face touching the ground. 
GEN.48.13	 Then Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right, facing Israel’s left, and Manasseh on his left, facing Israel’s right, and brought them close to him. 
GEN.48.14	 But Israel crossed his hands and reached out. He put his right hand on Ephraim’s head, although Ephraim was the younger son. He put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, although Manasseh was older.
GEN.48.15	 Then Jacob blessed Joseph,
GEN.48.15	“May God, in whose presence my grandfather Abraham
GEN.48.15	and my father Isaac walked,
GEN.48.15	may God, who has been my shepherd all my life to this very day,
GEN.48.16	 may the Messenger, who has rescued me from all evil,
GEN.48.16	bless these boys.
GEN.48.16	May they be called by my name
GEN.48.16	and by the names of my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac.
GEN.48.16	May they have many children on the earth.”
GEN.48.17	 When Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he didn’t like it. So he took his father’s hand in order to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s. 
GEN.48.18	 Then he said to his father, “That’s not right, Father! This is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”
GEN.48.19	 His father refused and said, “I know, Son, I know! Manasseh, too, will become a nation, and he, too, will be important. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be more important than he, and his descendants will become many nations.”
GEN.48.20	 That day he blessed them. He said,
GEN.48.20	“Because of you, Israel will speak this blessing,
GEN.48.20	‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh!’”
GEN.48.20	In this way Israel put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
GEN.48.21	 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Now I’m about to die, but God will be with you. He will bring you back to the land of your fathers. 
GEN.48.22	 I’m giving you one more mountain ridge than your brothers. I took it from the Amorites with my own sword and bow.”
GEN.49.1	 Jacob called for his sons and said, “Come here, and let me tell you what will happen to you in the days to come.
GEN.49.2	 “Gather around and listen, sons of Jacob.
GEN.49.2	Listen to your father Israel.
GEN.49.3	 “Reuben, you are my firstborn,
GEN.49.3	my strength, the very first son I had,
GEN.49.3	first in majesty and first in power.
GEN.49.4	 You will no longer be first
GEN.49.4	because you were out of control like a flood
GEN.49.4	and you climbed into your father’s bed.
GEN.49.4	Then you dishonored it.
GEN.49.4	He climbed up on my couch.
GEN.49.5	 “Simeon and Levi are brothers.
GEN.49.5	Their swords 
GEN.49.6	 Do not let me attend their secret meetings.
GEN.49.6	Do not let me join their assembly.
GEN.49.6	In their anger they murdered men.
GEN.49.6	At their whim they crippled cattle.
GEN.49.7	 May their anger be cursed because it’s so fierce.
GEN.49.7	May their fury be cursed because it’s so cruel.
GEN.49.7	I will divide them among ⌊the sons of⌋ Jacob
GEN.49.7	and scatter them among ⌊the tribes of⌋ Israel.
GEN.49.8	 “Judah, your brothers will praise you.
GEN.49.8	Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies.
GEN.49.8	Your father’s sons will bow down to you.
GEN.49.9	 Judah, you are a lion cub.
GEN.49.9	You have come back from the kill, my son.
GEN.49.9	He lies down and rests like a lion.
GEN.49.9	He is like a lioness. Who dares to disturb him?
GEN.49.10	 A scepter will never depart from Judah
GEN.49.10	nor a ruler’s staff from between his feet
GEN.49.10	until Shiloh comes
GEN.49.10	and the people obey him.
GEN.49.11	 He will tie his donkey to a grapevine,
GEN.49.11	his colt to the best vine.
GEN.49.11	He will wash his clothes in wine,
GEN.49.11	his garments in the blood of grapes.
GEN.49.12	 His eyes are darker than wine.
GEN.49.12	His teeth are whiter than milk.
GEN.49.13	 “Zebulun will live by the coast.
GEN.49.13	He will have ships by the coast.
GEN.49.13	His border will go as far as Sidon.
GEN.49.14	 “Issachar is a strong donkey,
GEN.49.14	lying down between the saddlebags.
GEN.49.15	 When he sees that his resting place is good
GEN.49.15	and that the land is pleasant,
GEN.49.15	he will bend his back to the burden
GEN.49.15	and will become a slave laborer.
GEN.49.16	 “Dan will hand down decisions 
GEN.49.16	as one of the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.17	 Dan will be a snake on a road,
GEN.49.17	a viper on a path,
GEN.49.17	that bites a horse’s heels
GEN.49.17	so that its rider falls off backwards.
GEN.49.18	 “I wait with hope for you to rescue me, O L
GEN.49.19	 “Gad will be attacked by a band of raiders,
GEN.49.19	but he will strike back at their heels.
GEN.49.20	 “Asher’s food will be rich.
GEN.49.20	He will provide delicacies fit for a king.
GEN.49.21	 “Naphtali is a doe set free
GEN.49.21	that has beautiful fawns.
GEN.49.22	 “Joseph is a fruitful tree,
GEN.49.22	a fruitful tree by a spring,
GEN.49.22	with branches climbing over a wall.
GEN.49.23	 Archers provoked him,
GEN.49.23	shot at him,
GEN.49.23	and attacked him.
GEN.49.24	 But his bow stayed steady, and his arms remained limber
GEN.49.24	because of the help of the Mighty One of Jacob,
GEN.49.24	because of the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
GEN.49.25	 because of the God of your father who helps you,
GEN.49.25	because of the Almighty who gives you
GEN.49.25	blessings from the heavens above,
GEN.49.25	blessings from the deep springs below the ground,
GEN.49.25	blessings from breasts and womb.
GEN.49.26	 The blessings of your father are greater than
GEN.49.26	the blessings of the oldest mountains
GEN.49.26	and the riches of the ancient hills.
GEN.49.26	May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph,
GEN.49.26	on the crown of the prince among his brothers.
GEN.49.27	 “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf.
GEN.49.27	In the morning he devours his prey.
GEN.49.27	In the evening he divides the plunder.”
GEN.49.28	 These are the 12 tribes of Israel and what their father said to them when he gave each of them his special blessing.
GEN.49.29	 Then he gave them these instructions, “I am about to join my ancestors in death. Bury me with my ancestors in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite. 
GEN.49.30	 Abraham bought the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, east of Mamre in Canaan, from Ephron the Hittite to use as a tomb. 
GEN.49.31	 Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there. Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried there. I also buried Leah there. 
GEN.49.32	 The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites.”
GEN.49.33	 When Jacob finished giving these instructions to his sons, he pulled his feet into his bed. He took his last breath and joined his ancestors in death.
GEN.50.1	 Joseph threw himself on his father, cried over him, and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	 Then Joseph ordered the doctors in his service to embalm his father. So the doctors embalmed Israel. 
GEN.50.3	 The embalming was completed in the usual time—40 days. The Egyptians mourned for him 70 days.
GEN.50.4	 When the time of mourning for Jacob was over, Joseph spoke to the Pharaoh’s palace staff. He said, “Please speak directly to Pharaoh. Tell him, 
GEN.50.5	 ‘My father made me swear an oath. He said, “I’m about to die. Bury me in the tomb I bought for myself in Canaan.” Please let me go there and bury my father; then I’ll come back.’ ”
GEN.50.6	 Pharaoh replied, “Go and bury your father, as you have promised him.”
GEN.50.7	 So Joseph left to bury his father. All Pharaoh’s officials, the leaders in his palace staff, and all the leaders of Egypt went with him. 
GEN.50.8	 Joseph’s household, his brothers, and his father’s household also went with him. (Only their children, their flocks, and their cattle were left in Goshen.) 
GEN.50.9	 Chariots and horsemen went with him. It was a very large group.
GEN.50.10	 When they came to the threshing floor 
GEN.50.11	 When the Canaanites living there saw the funeral ceremonies at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “These funeral ceremonies are taken very seriously by the Egyptians.” That’s why that place on the east side of the Jordan was named Abel Mizraim [Egyptian Funeral Ceremonies].
GEN.50.12	 Jacob’s sons did for him what he had told them to do. 
GEN.50.13	 They carried him back to Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, east of Mamre. Abraham had bought this tomb from Ephron the Hittite.
GEN.50.14	 After Joseph had buried his father, he went back to Egypt along with his brothers and everyone who had gone there with him to bury his father.
GEN.50.15	 Joseph’s brothers realized what their father’s death could mean. So they thought, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us? What if he decides to pay us back for all the evil we did to him?” 
GEN.50.16	 They sent a messenger to Joseph to say, “Before your father died, he commanded us, 
GEN.50.17	 ‘This is what you should say to Joseph, “I’m begging you to forgive the crime and the sin your brothers committed against you. What they did to you was very evil.”’ So now, please forgive our crime, because we are servants of your father’s God.” Joseph cried when he got their message.
GEN.50.18	 Then his brothers also came and immediately bowed down in front of him. “We are your slaves!” they said.
GEN.50.19	 Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid! I can’t take God’s place. 
GEN.50.20	 Even though you planned evil against me, God planned good to come out of it. This was to keep many people alive, as he is doing now. 
GEN.50.21	 Don’t be afraid! I will provide for you and your children.” In this way he reassured them, setting their minds at ease.
GEN.50.22	 Joseph and his father’s family stayed in Egypt. Joseph lived to be 110 years old. 
GEN.50.23	 He saw his grandchildren, Ephraim’s children. Even the children of Machir, son of Manasseh, were adopted by Joseph at birth.
GEN.50.24	 At last Joseph said to his brothers, “I’m about to die. God will definitely take care of you and take you out of this land to the land he swore with an oath to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” 
GEN.50.25	 Joseph made Israel’s sons swear an oath. He said, “God will definitely take care of you. So be sure to carry my bones back with you.”
GEN.50.26	 Joseph died when he was 110 years old. His body was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	 These are the names of the sons of Israel (that is, Jacob) who came with him to Egypt with their families: 
EXO.1.2	 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 
EXO.1.3	 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 
EXO.1.4	 Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	 Joseph was already in Egypt. The total number of Jacob’s descendants was 70.
EXO.1.6	 Eventually, Joseph, all his brothers, and that entire generation died. 
EXO.1.7	 But the descendants of Israel had many children. They became so numerous and strong that the land was filled with them.
EXO.1.8	 Then a new king, who knew nothing about Joseph, began to rule in Egypt. 
EXO.1.9	 He said to his people, “There are too many Israelites, and they are stronger than we are. 
EXO.1.10	 We have to outsmart them, or they’ll increase in number. Then, if war breaks out, they will join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.”
EXO.1.11	 So the Egyptians put slave drivers in charge of them in order to oppress them through forced labor. They built Pithom and Rameses as supply cities for Pharaoh. 
EXO.1.12	 But the more the Israelites were oppressed, the more they increased in number and spread out. The Egyptians couldn’t stand them ⌊any longer⌋. 
EXO.1.13	 So they forced the Israelites to work hard as slaves. 
EXO.1.14	 They made their lives bitter with back-breaking work in mortar and bricks and every kind of work in the fields. All the jobs the Egyptians gave them were brutally hard.
EXO.1.15	 Then the king of Egypt told the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, 
EXO.1.16	 “When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth, look at the child when you deliver it. If it’s a boy, kill it, but if it’s a girl, let it live.”
EXO.1.17	 However, the midwives feared God and didn’t obey the king of Egypt’s orders. They let the boys live. 
EXO.1.18	 So the king of Egypt called for the midwives. He asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”
EXO.1.19	 The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women. They are so healthy that they have their babies before a midwife arrives.”
EXO.1.20	 God was good to the midwives. So the people increased in number and became very strong. 
EXO.1.21	 Because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
EXO.1.22	 Then Pharaoh commanded all his people to throw into the Nile every ⌊Hebrew⌋ boy that was born, but to let every girl live.
EXO.2.1	 A man from Levi’s family married a Levite woman. 
EXO.2.2	 The woman became pregnant and had a son. She saw how beautiful he was and hid him for three months. 
EXO.2.3	 When she couldn’t hide him any longer, she took a basket made of papyrus plants and coated it with tar and pitch. She put the baby in it and set it among the papyrus plants near the bank of the Nile River. 
EXO.2.4	 The baby’s sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
EXO.2.5	 While Pharaoh’s daughter came to the Nile to take a bath, her servants walked along the bank of the river. She saw the basket among the papyrus plants and sent her slave girl to get it. 
EXO.2.6	 Pharaoh’s daughter opened the basket, looked at the baby, and saw it was a boy. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. She said, “This is one of the Hebrew children.”
EXO.2.7	 Then the baby’s sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?”
EXO.2.8	 She answered, “Yes!” So the girl brought the baby’s mother.
EXO.2.9	 Pharaoh’s daughter said to the woman, “Take this child, nurse him for me, and I will pay you.”
EXO.2.9	She took the child and nursed him. 
EXO.2.10	 When the child was old enough, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. Pharaoh’s daughter named him Moses [Pulled Out] and said, “I pulled him out of the water.”
EXO.2.11	 In the course of time Moses grew up. Then he went to ⌊see⌋ his own people and watched them suffering under forced labor. He saw a Hebrew, one of his own people, being beaten by an Egyptian. 
EXO.2.12	 He looked all around, and when he didn’t see anyone, he beat the Egyptian to death and hid the body in the sand.
EXO.2.13	 When Moses went there the next day, he saw two Hebrew men fighting. He asked the one who started the fight, “Why are you beating another Hebrew?”
EXO.2.14	 The man asked, “Who made you our ruler and judge? Are you going to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought that everyone knew what he had done.
EXO.2.15	 When Pharaoh heard what Moses had done, he tried to have him killed. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian.
EXO.2.15	One day, while Moses was sitting by a well, 
EXO.2.16	 seven daughters of the priest of Midian came. They drew water and filled the troughs to water their father’s sheep. 
EXO.2.17	 But some shepherds came and chased them away. So Moses got up, came to their defense, and then watered their sheep.
EXO.2.18	 When they came back to their father Reuel, he asked them, “Why have you come home so early today?”
EXO.2.19	 They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from some shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the sheep.”
EXO.2.20	 Reuel asked his daughters, “Where is he? Why did you leave the man there? Go, invite him to supper.”
EXO.2.21	 Moses decided to stay with the man. So Reuel gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses as his wife. 
EXO.2.22	 She gave birth to a son. Moses named him Gershom [Foreigner], because he said, “I was a foreigner living in another country.”
EXO.2.23	 After a long time passed, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites still groaned because they were slaves. So they cried out, and their cries for help went up to God. 
EXO.2.24	 God heard their groaning, and he remembered his promise 
EXO.2.25	 God saw the Israelites ⌊being oppressed⌋ and was concerned about them.
EXO.3.1	 Moses was taking care of the sheep of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. As he led the sheep to the far side of the desert, he came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
EXO.3.2	 The Messenger of the L
EXO.3.3	 So he thought, “Why isn’t this bush burning up? I must go over there and see this strange sight.”
EXO.3.4	 When the L
EXO.3.4	Moses answered, “Here I am!”
EXO.3.5	 God said, “Don’t come any closer! Take off your sandals because this place where you are standing is holy ground. 
EXO.3.6	 I am the God of your ancestors,
EXO.3.7	 The L
EXO.3.8	 I have come to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good land with plenty of room ⌊for everyone⌋. It is a land flowing with milk and honey where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites live. 
EXO.3.9	 I have heard the cry of the people of Israel. I have seen how the Egyptians are oppressing them. 
EXO.3.10	 Now, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you can bring my people Israel out of Egypt.”
EXO.3.11	 But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the people of Israel out of Egypt?”
EXO.3.12	 God answered, “I will be with you. And this will be the proof that I sent you: When you bring the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship God on this mountain.”
EXO.3.13	 Then Moses replied to God, “Suppose I go to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ What should I tell them?”
EXO.3.14	 God answered Moses, “I Am Who I Am. This is what you must say to the people of Israel: ‘I Am has sent me to you.’ ”
EXO.3.15	 Again God said to Moses, “This is what you must say to the people of Israel: The L
EXO.3.16	 “Go, assemble the leaders of Israel. Say to them, ‘The L
EXO.3.17	 I promise I will take you away from your misery in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’
EXO.3.18	 “The leaders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the leaders must go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The L
EXO.3.19	 I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, even if he is forced to. 
EXO.3.20	 So I will use my power to strike Egypt. After all the miracles that I will do there, he will let you go. 
EXO.3.21	 I will make the Egyptians kind to the people of Israel so that, when you leave, you will not leave empty-handed.
EXO.3.22	 “Every Hebrew woman should ask her Egyptian neighbor and any woman living in her home for silver and gold jewelry and for clothes. Put them on your sons and daughters. This way you will strip Egypt of its wealth.”
EXO.4.1	 “They will never believe me or listen to me!” Moses protested. “They will say, ‘The L
EXO.4.2	 Then the L
EXO.4.2	He answered, “A shepherd’s staff.”
EXO.4.3	 The L
EXO.4.3	When Moses threw it on the ground, it became a snake, and he ran away from it.
EXO.4.4	 Then the L
EXO.4.5	 ⌊The L
EXO.4.6	 The L
EXO.4.7	 “Now put your hand back inside your shirt,” the L
EXO.4.8	 ⌊Then the L
EXO.4.9	 But if they won’t believe these two miraculous signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile River and pour it on the ground. The water you take from the Nile will turn into blood on the ground.”
EXO.4.10	 Moses said to the L
EXO.4.11	 The L
EXO.4.12	 Now go, and I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.”
EXO.4.13	 But Moses said, “Please, Lord, send someone else.”
EXO.4.14	 Then the L
EXO.4.15	 You will speak to him and tell him what to say. I will help both of you speak, and I will teach you both what to do. 
EXO.4.16	 Aaron will speak to the people for you. He will be your spokesman, and you will be like God. 
EXO.4.17	 Take that shepherd’s staff with you, and use it to do the miraculous signs.”
EXO.4.18	 Then Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro. Moses said to him, “Please let me go back to my own people in Egypt. I would like to see if they’re still alive.”
EXO.4.18	Jethro said to Moses, “You may go.”
EXO.4.19	 Now, the L
EXO.4.20	 So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and started out for Egypt. He also brought with him the staff God had told him to take.
EXO.4.21	 The L
EXO.4.22	 Then tell Pharaoh, ‘This is what the L
EXO.4.23	 I told you to let my son go so that he may worship me. But you refused to let him go. So now I’m going to kill your firstborn son.’ ”
EXO.4.24	 Along the way they stopped for the night. The L
EXO.4.25	 Then Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin, and touched Moses’ feet ⌊with it⌋. She said, “You are a bridegroom of blood to me!” 
EXO.4.26	 So the L
EXO.4.27	 Meanwhile, the L
EXO.4.27	When Aaron met Moses at the mountain of God, he kissed him. 
EXO.4.28	 Moses told Aaron everything the L
EXO.4.29	 Then Moses and Aaron went ⌊to Egypt⌋ and assembled all the leaders of the people of Israel. 
EXO.4.30	 Aaron told them everything the L
EXO.4.31	 and the people believed them. When they heard that the L
EXO.5.1	 Later Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the L
EXO.5.2	 Pharaoh asked, “Who is the L
EXO.5.3	 They replied, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the L
EXO.5.4	 The king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why are you distracting the people from their work? Get back to work!” 
EXO.5.5	 Then Pharaoh added, “Look how many people there are in the land! Do you want them to quit working?”
EXO.5.6	 That same day Pharaoh gave these orders to the slave drivers and foremen: 
EXO.5.7	 “Don’t give the people any more straw to make bricks as you have been doing. Let them gather their own straw, 
EXO.5.8	 but insist that they make the same number of bricks they were making before. Making fewer bricks will not be acceptable. They’re lazy! That’s why they’re crying, ‘Let us go offer sacrifices to our God.’ 
EXO.5.9	 Make the work harder for these people so that they will be too busy to listen to lies.”
EXO.5.10	 The slave drivers and foreman went out and said to them, “This is what Pharaoh says: I’m no longer giving you straw. 
EXO.5.11	 Get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work load will not be reduced one bit.”
EXO.5.12	 So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
EXO.5.13	 The slave drivers kept hurrying them. They said, “Finish the same amount of work each day, just as when you had straw.”
EXO.5.14	 Pharaoh’s slave drivers had placed Israelite foremen in charge of the people. The slave drivers beat the foremen and said, “You didn’t finish all the bricks you were ordered to make yesterday or today. Why didn’t you make as many as you used to?”
EXO.5.15	 Then the Israelite foremen complained to Pharaoh. They asked, “Why are you treating us this way? 
EXO.5.16	 We’re given no straw, and yet we’re told to make bricks. We’re being beaten, but your men are at fault.”
EXO.5.17	 “You’re lazy! ⌊Just plain⌋ lazy!” Pharaoh answered. “That’s why you keep saying, ‘Let us go offer sacrifices to the L
EXO.5.18	 Now get back to work! You won’t be given any straw, but you must still make the same number of bricks.”
EXO.5.19	 The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, “Don’t make fewer bricks each day than you’re supposed to.”
EXO.5.20	 As they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting for them. 
EXO.5.21	 So they said, “May the L
EXO.5.22	 Moses went back to the L
EXO.5.23	 Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak for you, he has treated your people cruelly, and you have done nothing at all to rescue your people.”
EXO.6.1	 Then the L
EXO.6.2	 God spoke to Moses, “I am the L
EXO.6.3	 I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but I didn’t make myself known to them by my name, the L
EXO.6.4	 I even made a promise 
EXO.6.5	 Now I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians hold in slavery, and I have remembered my promise.
EXO.6.6	 “Tell the Israelites, ‘I am the L
EXO.6.7	 Then I will make you my people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am the L
EXO.6.8	 I will bring you to the land I solemnly swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as your own possession. I am the L
EXO.6.9	 Moses reported this to the Israelites. But they would not listen to him because they were so discouraged by their back–breaking work.
EXO.6.10	 Then the L
EXO.6.11	 “Go tell Pharaoh (the king of Egypt) to let the Israelites leave his country.”
EXO.6.12	 But Moses protested to the L
EXO.6.13	 The L
EXO.6.14	 These were the heads of the families:
EXO.6.14	The sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
EXO.6.14	These were the families descended from Reuben.
EXO.6.15	 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the families descended from Simeon.
EXO.6.16	 These are the names of the sons of Levi listed in birth order: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
EXO.6.17	 The sons of Gershon listed by their families were Libni and Shimei.
EXO.6.18	 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
EXO.6.19	 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi.
EXO.6.19	These were the families descended from Levi listed in birth order.
EXO.6.20	 Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed. She gave birth to Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
EXO.6.21	 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
EXO.6.22	 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
EXO.6.23	 Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon. She gave birth to Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
EXO.6.24	 The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph.
EXO.6.24	These were the families descended from Korah.
EXO.6.25	 Eleazar, son of Aaron, married one of the daughters of Putiel. She gave birth to Phinehas.
EXO.6.25	These were the heads of Levite households listed by their families.
EXO.6.26	 This was the same Aaron and Moses to whom the L
EXO.6.27	 They—this same Moses and Aaron—told Pharaoh (the king of Egypt) to let the Israelites leave Egypt.
EXO.6.28	 At that time the L
EXO.6.29	 He said to Moses, “I am the L
EXO.6.30	 But Moses said to the L
EXO.7.1	 The L
EXO.7.2	 Tell your brother Aaron everything I command you, and he must tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites leave the country. 
EXO.7.3	 But I will make Pharaoh stubborn. Even though I will do many miraculous signs and amazing things in Egypt, 
EXO.7.4	 Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will use my power to punish Egypt severely, and I will bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt in organized family groups. 
EXO.7.5	 The Egyptians will know that I am the L
EXO.7.6	 Moses and Aaron did as the L
EXO.7.7	 Moses was 80 years old and Aaron was 83 when they talked to Pharaoh.
EXO.7.8	 The L
EXO.7.9	 “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Give me a sign to prove that God has sent you,’ tell Aaron, ‘Take your shepherd’s staff and throw it down in front of Pharaoh,’ and it will become a large snake.”
EXO.7.10	 Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the L
EXO.7.11	 Then Pharaoh sent for his wise men and sorcerers. These Egyptian magicians did the same thing using their magic spells. 
EXO.7.12	 Each of them threw his staff down, and they all became large snakes. But Aaron’s staff swallowed theirs. 
EXO.7.13	 Yet, Pharaoh continued to be stubborn and would not listen to them, as the L
EXO.7.14	 Then the L
EXO.7.15	 In the morning meet Pharaoh when he’s on his way to the Nile. Wait for him on the bank of the river. Take along the staff that turned into a snake. 
EXO.7.16	 Say to him, ‘The L
EXO.7.17	 Here is what the L
EXO.7.18	 The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink. The Egyptians will not be able to drink any water from the Nile.’ ”
EXO.7.19	 The L
EXO.7.20	 Moses and Aaron did as the L
EXO.7.21	 The fish in the Nile died, and it smelled so bad that the Egyptians couldn’t drink any water from the river. There was blood everywhere in Egypt.
EXO.7.22	 But the Egyptian magicians did the same thing using their magic spells. So Pharaoh continued to be stubborn and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, as the L
EXO.7.23	 Pharaoh turned and went back to his palace. He dismissed the entire matter from his mind.
EXO.7.24	 All the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink because they couldn’t drink any of the water from the river.
EXO.7.25	 Seven days passed after the L
EXO.8.1	 Then the L
EXO.8.2	 If you refuse to let them go, I will bring a plague of frogs on your whole country. 
EXO.8.3	 The Nile River will swarm with frogs. They will come into your palace, into your bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your officials, on your people, into your ovens and into your mixing bowls. 
EXO.8.4	 The frogs will jump on you, on your people, and on all your officials.’ ”
EXO.8.5	 Then the L
EXO.8.6	 So Aaron held his staff over the waters of Egypt. The frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.7	 But the magicians did the same thing using their magic spells and brought frogs onto the land.
EXO.8.8	 Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray that the L
EXO.8.9	 Moses answered Pharaoh, “You may have the honor of choosing when I should pray for you, your officials, and your people. Then the frogs will leave you and your homes. The only ones left will be those in the Nile.”
EXO.8.10	 “Pray for me tomorrow,” Pharaoh said.
EXO.8.10	Moses replied, “It will be as you say so that you will know that there is no one like the L
EXO.8.11	 The frogs will leave you, your homes, your officials, and your people. The only frogs left will be those in the Nile.”
EXO.8.12	 After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses prayed to the L
EXO.8.13	 The L
EXO.8.14	 They were piled into countless heaps, and the land began to stink because of them.
EXO.8.15	 When Pharaoh saw that the plague was over, he became stubborn and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, as the L
EXO.8.16	 Then the L
EXO.8.17	 When Moses told him, Aaron held out the staff in his hand and struck the dust on the ground. It turned into gnats that bit people and animals. All the dust on the ground everywhere in Egypt turned into gnats.
EXO.8.18	 The magicians also tried to produce gnats using their magic spells, but they couldn’t do it. The gnats bit people and animals. 
EXO.8.19	 So the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the hand of God!”
EXO.8.19	Yet, Pharaoh continued to be stubborn and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, as the L
EXO.8.20	 Then the L
EXO.8.21	 If you will not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you, your officials, your people, and your houses. The homes of the Egyptians will be filled with flies, and even the ground outside will be covered with them. 
EXO.8.22	 But on that day I will treat the region of Goshen differently. That is where my people live. There won’t be any flies there. This way you will know that I, the L
EXO.8.23	 I will distinguish between my people and yours. This miraculous sign will happen tomorrow.’ ”
EXO.8.24	 The L
EXO.8.25	 Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in this country.”
EXO.8.26	 Moses replied, “It wouldn’t be right to do that. The sacrifices we offer to the L
EXO.8.27	 We need to travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the L
EXO.8.28	 Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, but don’t go very far. You may offer sacrifices to the L

EXO.9.6	 The next day the L
EXO.9.7	 Pharaoh found out that not one of the Israelites’ animals had died. Yet, Pharaoh continued to be stubborn and would not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	 Then the L
EXO.9.9	 They will become a fine dust throughout Egypt. The dust will cause boils to break into open sores on people and animals throughout Egypt.”
EXO.9.10	 They took ashes from a kiln and stood in front of Pharaoh. Moses threw the ashes up in the air, and they caused boils to break into open sores on people and animals. 
EXO.9.11	 The magicians couldn’t compete with Moses because they had boils like all the other Egyptians.
EXO.9.12	 But the L

EXO.9.14	 Now I will send plagues that will affect you personally as well as your officials and people. This is how you will know that there is no one like me anywhere on earth. 
EXO.9.15	 By now I could have used my power to kill you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. 
EXO.9.16	 But I have spared you for this reason. I want to show you my power and make my name famous throughout the earth.
EXO.9.17	 You are still blocking my people from leaving. 
EXO.9.18	 So, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever happened in Egypt since the beginning of its history. 
EXO.9.19	 Now, send ⌊servants⌋ to bring your livestock and everything else you have indoors. All people and animals still outside and not brought in will die when the hail falls on them.’ ”
EXO.9.20	 Those members of Pharaoh’s court who listened to the L
EXO.9.21	 But those who didn’t take the L
EXO.9.22	 Then the L
EXO.9.23	 When Moses lifted his staff toward the sky, the L
EXO.9.24	 It hailed, and lightning flashed while it hailed. This was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. 
EXO.9.25	 All over Egypt the hail knocked down everything that was out in the open. It struck down people, animals, and every plant in the fields and destroyed every tree in the fields. 
EXO.9.26	 The only place it didn’t hail was the region of Goshen, where the Israelites lived.
EXO.9.27	 Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he told them. “The L

EXO.9.29	 Moses replied, “As soon as I’m out of the city, I’ll spread out my hands to the L

EXO.9.31	 (The flax and the barley were ruined, because the barley had formed heads and the flax was in bloom. 
EXO.9.32	 Neither the wheat nor the wild grain was damaged, because they ripen later.)
EXO.9.33	 As soon as he left Pharaoh and went out of the city, Moses spread out his hands to the L
EXO.9.34	 When Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had stopped, he sinned again. He and his officials continued to be stubborn. 
EXO.9.35	 Pharaoh was stubborn and would not let the Israelites go, as the L
EXO.10.1	 Then the L
EXO.10.2	 You will be able to tell your children and grandchildren exactly how I treated the Egyptians and what miraculous signs I did among them. This is how you will all know that I am the L

EXO.10.4	 If you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country. 
EXO.10.5	 They will cover the land so that the ground can’t be seen. They will eat everything left by the hail, including every tree still standing in the fields. 
EXO.10.6	 They will fill your houses and the houses of all your officials and those of all the Egyptians. Your parents and ancestors never saw anything like this from the time they first came here until now.” Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
EXO.10.7	 Then Pharaoh’s officials asked him, “How long will this man hold us in his grip? Let the Israelite men go to worship the L
EXO.10.8	 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the L
EXO.10.9	 Moses answered, “Everyone! We’ll be taking our young and old, our sons and daughters, our flocks and herds with us. For us it’s a pilgrimage festival in the L
EXO.10.10	 Pharaoh said to them, “The L
EXO.10.11	 No! Only the men may go to worship the L
EXO.10.12	 The L
EXO.10.13	 Moses held his staff over the land of Egypt, and the L
EXO.10.14	 They invaded all of Egypt and landed all over the country in great swarms. Never before had there been so many locusts like this, nor would there ever be that many again. 
EXO.10.15	 They covered all the ground until it was black ⌊with them⌋. They ate all the plants and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left. Nothing green was left on any tree or plant anywhere in Egypt.
EXO.10.16	 Then Pharaoh quickly called for Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the L
EXO.10.17	 Please forgive my sin one more time. Pray to the L
EXO.10.18	 Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the L
EXO.10.19	 Then the L
EXO.10.20	 But the L
EXO.10.21	 Then the L
EXO.10.22	 Moses lifted his hand toward the sky, and throughout Egypt there was total darkness for three days. 
EXO.10.23	 People couldn’t see each other, and no one went anywhere for three days. But all the Israelites had light where they were living.
EXO.10.24	 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and said, “Go, worship the L
EXO.10.25	 But Moses said, “You must allow us to take ⌊our animals⌋ for the sacrifices and burnt offerings we have to make to the L
EXO.10.26	 All our livestock must go with us. Not one animal must be left behind. We’ll have to use some of them for worshiping the L
EXO.10.27	 But the L
EXO.10.28	 Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Don’t ever let me see your face again. The day I do, you will die.”
EXO.10.29	 “You’re right!” Moses answered. “You’ll never see my face again.”
EXO.11.1	 Then the L
EXO.11.2	 Now announce to the people ⌊of Israel⌋ that each man and woman must ask the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry.”
EXO.11.3	 The L
EXO.11.4	 Moses said, “This is what the L
EXO.11.5	 Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who rules the land, to the firstborn children of female slaves who use their handmills, including every firstborn domestic animal. 
EXO.11.6	 There will be loud crying throughout Egypt, such as there has never been or ever will be again. 
EXO.11.7	 But where the Israelites are, not even a dog will be startled by any person or animal. This is how you will see that the L
EXO.11.8	 Then all these officials of yours will come, bow down to me, and say, ‘You and all the people who follow you, get out!’ After that I will leave.” Burning with anger, Moses left Pharaoh.
EXO.11.9	 The L
EXO.11.10	 Moses and Aaron showed Pharaoh all these amazing things. Yet, the L
EXO.12.1	 The L
EXO.12.2	 “This month will be the very first month of the year for you. 
EXO.12.3	 Tell the whole community of Israel: On the tenth ⌊day⌋ of this month each man must take a lamb or a young goat for his family—one animal per household. 
EXO.12.4	 A household may be too small to eat a whole animal. That household and the one next door can share one animal. Choose your animal based on the number of people and what each person can eat. 
EXO.12.5	 Your animal must be a one-year-old male that has no defects. You may choose a lamb or a young goat. 
EXO.12.6	 Take care of it until the fourteenth ⌊day⌋ of this month.
EXO.12.6	“Then at dusk, all the assembled people from the community of Israel must slaughter their animals. 
EXO.12.7	 They must take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they will eat the animals. 
EXO.12.8	 The meat must be eaten that same night. It must be roasted over a fire and eaten with bitter herbs and unleavened bread. 
EXO.12.9	 Don’t eat any of it raw or boiled but roast the whole animal over a fire. 
EXO.12.10	 Don’t leave any of it until morning. Anything left over in the morning must be burned up. 
EXO.12.11	 This is how ⌊you should be dressed when⌋ you eat it: with your belt on, your sandals on your feet, and your shepherd’s staff in your hand. You must eat it in a hurry. It is the L

EXO.12.13	 But the blood on your houses will be a sign for your protection. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. Nothing will touch or destroy you when I strike Egypt.
EXO.12.14	 “This day will be one for you to remember. This is a permanent law for generations to come: You will celebrate this day as a pilgrimage festival in the L
EXO.12.15	 For seven days you must eat unleavened bread. On the very first day you must remove any yeast that you have in your houses. Whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh day must be excluded from Israel. 
EXO.12.16	 You must have a holy assembly on the first day and another one on the seventh. You must not work on these days except to prepare your own meals. That’s all you may do.
EXO.12.17	 You must celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread because it was on this very day that I brought you out of Egypt in organized family groups. This is a permanent law for future generations: You must celebrate this day. 
EXO.12.18	 From the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month until the evening of the twenty-first day you must eat unleavened bread. 
EXO.12.19	 There should be no yeast in your houses for seven days. Whoever eats anything with yeast in it must be excluded from the community of Israel, whether he is an Israelite or not. 
EXO.12.20	 Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat ⌊only⌋ unleavened bread.”
EXO.12.21	 Then Moses called for all the leaders of Israel. He said to them, “Pick out a lamb or a young goat for your families, and kill the Passover animal. 
EXO.12.22	 Take the branch of a hyssop plant, dip it in the blood which is in a bowl, and put some of the blood on the top and sides of the doorframes ⌊of your houses⌋. No one may leave the house until morning.

EXO.12.28	 The Israelites did as the L
EXO.12.29	 At midnight the L
EXO.12.30	 Pharaoh, all his officials, and all the ⌊other⌋ Egyptians got up during the night. There was loud crying throughout Egypt because in every house someone had died.
EXO.12.31	 Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron during the night. He said, “You and the Israelites must leave my people at once. Go, worship the L
EXO.12.32	 Take your flocks and herds, too, as you asked. Just go! And bless me, too!”
EXO.12.33	 The Egyptians begged the people to leave the country quickly. They said, “Soon we’ll all be dead!” 
EXO.12.34	 So the people picked up their bread dough before it had risen and carried it on their shoulders in bowls, wrapped up in their clothes.
EXO.12.35	 The Israelites did what Moses had told them and asked the Egyptians for gold and silver jewelry and for clothes. 
EXO.12.36	 The L
EXO.12.37	 The Israelites left Rameses to go to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, plus all the women and children. 
EXO.12.38	 Many other people also went with them, along with large numbers of sheep, goats, and cattle.
EXO.12.39	 With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked round, flat bread. The dough hadn’t risen because they’d been thrown out of Egypt and had no time to prepare food for the trip.
EXO.12.40	 The Israelites had been living in Egypt for 430 years.

EXO.12.46	 “The meal must be eaten inside one house. Never take any of the meat outside the house.

EXO.13.17	 When Pharaoh let the people go, God didn’t lead them on the road through Philistine territory, although that was the shortest route. God said, “If they see that they have to fight a war, they may change their minds and go back to Egypt.” 
EXO.13.18	 So God led the people around the other way, on the road through the desert toward the Red Sea. The Israelites were ready for battle when they left Egypt.
EXO.13.19	 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, because Joseph had made the Israelites solemnly swear to do this. Joseph had said, “God will definitely come to help you. When he does, take my bones with you.”
EXO.13.20	 They moved from Succoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the desert. 
EXO.13.21	 By day the L
EXO.13.22	 The column of smoke was always in front of the people during the day. The column of fire was always there at night.
EXO.14.1	 Then the L

EXO.14.4	 I will make Pharaoh so stubborn that he will pursue them. Then, because of what I do to Pharaoh and his entire army, I will receive honor, and the Egyptians will know that I am the L
EXO.14.5	 When Pharaoh (the king of Egypt) was told that the people had fled, he and his officials changed their minds about them. They said, “What have we done? We’ve lost our slaves because we’ve let Israel go.” 
EXO.14.6	 So Pharaoh prepared his chariot and took his army with him. 
EXO.14.7	 He took 600 of his best chariots as well as all the other chariots in Egypt, placing an officer in each of them. 
EXO.14.8	 The L
EXO.14.9	 The Egyptians pursued the Israelites. Pharaoh’s army, including all his horse-drawn chariots and cavalry, caught up with them as they were setting up their camp by the sea at Pi Hahiroth facing north.
EXO.14.10	 As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw that the Egyptians were coming after them. Terrified, the Israelites cried out to the L
EXO.14.11	 They said to Moses, “Did you bring us out into the desert to die because there were no graves in Egypt? Look what you’ve done by bringing us out of Egypt! 
EXO.14.12	 Didn’t we tell you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone! Let us go on serving the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”

EXO.14.18	 The Egyptians will know that I am the L
EXO.14.19	 The Messenger of God, who had been in front of the Israelites, moved behind them. So the column of smoke moved from in front of the Israelites and stood behind them 
EXO.14.20	 between the Egyptian camp and the Israelite camp. The ⌊column of⌋ smoke was there when darkness came, and it lit up the night. Neither side came near the other all night long.
EXO.14.21	 Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. All that night the L
EXO.14.22	 and the Israelites went through the middle of the sea on dry ground. The water stood like a wall on their right and on their left.
EXO.14.23	 The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and cavalry followed them into the sea. 
EXO.14.24	 Just before dawn, the L
EXO.14.25	 He made the wheels of their chariots come off so that they could hardly move. Then the Egyptians shouted, “Let’s get out of here! The L
EXO.14.26	 Then the L
EXO.14.27	 Moses stretched his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the water returned to its usual place. The Egyptians tried to escape, but the L
EXO.14.28	 The water flowed back and covered Pharaoh’s entire army, as well as the chariots and the cavalry that had followed Israel into the sea. Not one of them survived.
EXO.14.29	 Meanwhile, the Israelites had gone through the sea on dry ground while the water stood like a wall on their right and on their left. 
EXO.14.30	 That day the L

EXO.15.6	Your right hand, O L

EXO.15.21	He has won a glorious victory.
EXO.15.21	He has thrown horses and their riders into the sea.”
EXO.15.22	 Moses led Israel away from the Red Sea into the desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water. 
EXO.15.23	 When they came to Marah, they couldn’t drink the water because it tasted bitter. That’s why the place was called Marah [Bitter Place]. 
EXO.15.24	 The people complained about Moses by asking, “What are we supposed to drink?”
EXO.15.25	 Moses cried out to the L
EXO.15.25	There the L

EXO.15.27	 Next, they went to Elim, where there were 12 springs and 70 palm trees. They camped there by the water.
EXO.16.1	 The whole community of Israelites moved from Elim and came to the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai. This was on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left Egypt. 
EXO.16.2	 In the desert the whole community complained about Moses and Aaron. 
EXO.16.3	 The Israelites said to them, “If only the L
EXO.16.4	 The L
EXO.16.5	 But on the sixth day when they prepare what they bring home, it should be twice as much as they gather on other days.”

EXO.16.13	 That evening quails came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. 
EXO.16.14	 When the dew was gone, the ground was covered with a thin layer of flakes like frost on the ground. 
EXO.16.15	 When the Israelites saw it, they asked each other, “What is this?” because they didn’t know what it was.
EXO.16.15	Moses said to them, “It’s the food the L
EXO.16.16	 This is what the L
EXO.16.17	 So that is what the Israelites did. Some gathered more, some less. 
EXO.16.18	 They measured it into two-quart containers. Those who had gathered more didn’t have too much. Those who had gathered less didn’t have too little. They gathered as much as they could eat.
EXO.16.19	 Then Moses said to them, “No one may keep any of it until morning.”
EXO.16.20	 But some of them didn’t listen to Moses. They kept part of it until morning, and it was full of worms and smelled bad. So Moses was angry with them.
EXO.16.21	 Each morning they gathered as much food as they could eat. When the sun was hot, it melted away. 
EXO.16.22	 But on the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, four quarts per person. All the leaders of the community came to Moses and told him about it.
EXO.16.23	 He said to them, “This is what the L
EXO.16.24	 So they saved it until the next morning as Moses had commanded, but it didn’t smell or have worms in it. 
EXO.16.25	 “Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a day of worship dedicated to the L
EXO.16.26	 You can gather food on six days, but on the seventh day, the day of worship, you won’t find any.”
EXO.16.27	 On the seventh day some people went out to gather food, but they didn’t find any. 
EXO.16.28	 The L
EXO.16.29	 Remember: The L
EXO.16.30	 So the people never worked on the seventh day of the week.
EXO.16.31	 The Israelites called the food

EXO.16.33	 Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, put two quarts of manna in it, and put it in the L
EXO.16.34	 Aaron put the jar of manna in front of the words of God’s promise to be kept there, as the L
EXO.16.35	 The Israelites ate manna for 40 years until they came to a place to settle. They ate manna until they came to the border of Canaan.
EXO.16.36	 (Now, the standard dry measure at that time held 20 quarts.)
EXO.17.1	 The whole community of Israelites left the desert of Sin and traveled from place to place as the L
EXO.17.2	 So they complained to Moses by saying, “Give us water to drink!”
EXO.17.2	Moses said to them, “Why are you complaining to me? Why are you testing the L
EXO.17.3	 But the people were thirsty for water there. They complained to Moses and asked, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Was it to make us, our children, and our livestock die of thirst?”
EXO.17.4	 So Moses cried out to the L
EXO.17.5	 The L
EXO.17.6	 I’ll be standing in front of you there by a rock at Mount Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.”
EXO.17.6	Moses did this while the leaders of Israel watched him.
EXO.17.7	 He named that place Massah [Testing] and Meribah [Complaining] because the Israelites complained and because they tested the L
EXO.17.8	 The Amalekites fought Israel at Rephidim. 
EXO.17.9	 Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men. Then fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill. I will hold in my hand the staff God told me to take along.”
EXO.17.10	 Joshua did as Moses told him and fought the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	 As long as Moses held up his hands, Israel would win, but as soon as he put his hands down, the Amalekites would start to win. 
EXO.17.12	 Eventually, Moses’ hands felt heavy. So Aaron and Hur took a rock, put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron held up one hand, and Hur held up the other. His hands remained steady until sunset. 
EXO.17.13	 So Joshua defeated the Amalekite army in battle.

EXO.33.4	 When the people heard this bad news, they acted as if someone had died. No one wore any jewelry. 
EXO.33.5	 The L
EXO.33.6	 After they left Mount Horeb, the Israelites no longer wore their jewelry.
EXO.33.7	 Now, Moses used to take a tent and set it up far outside the camp. He called it the tent of meeting. Anyone who was seeking the L
EXO.33.8	 Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand at the entrances to their tents and watch Moses until he went in. 
EXO.33.9	 As soon as Moses went into the tent, the column of smoke would come down and stay at the entrance to the tent while the L
EXO.33.10	 When all the people saw the column of smoke standing at the entrance to the tent, they would all bow with their faces touching the ground at the entrance to their own tents. 
EXO.33.11	 The L
EXO.33.12	 Moses said to the L
EXO.33.13	 If you really are pleased with me, show me your ways so that I can know you and so that you will continue to be pleased with me. Remember: This nation is your people.”
EXO.33.14	 The L
EXO.33.15	 Then Moses said to him, “If your presence is not going ⌊with us⌋, don’t make us leave this place. 
EXO.33.16	 How will anyone ever know you’re pleased with your people and me unless you go with us? Then we will be different from all other people on the face of the earth.”
EXO.33.17	 The L
EXO.33.18	 Then Moses said, “Please let me see your glory.”
EXO.33.19	 The L
EXO.33.20	 But you can’t see my face, because no one may see me and live.”
EXO.33.21	 Then the L

EXO.34.3	 No one may come with you or even be seen anywhere on the mountain. Even the flocks and herds may not graze in front of this mountain.”
EXO.34.4	 So Moses cut two ⌊more⌋ stone tablets like the first ones. Early the next morning he went up on Mount Sinai, as the L

EXO.34.6	 Then he passed in front of Moses, calling out, “The L

EXO.34.8	 Immediately, Moses knelt, bowing with his face touching the ground. 
EXO.34.9	 Then he said, “Lord, please go with us! Even though we are impossible to deal with, forgive our sin and the wrong we have done, and accept us as your own people.”
EXO.34.10	 The L

EXO.34.32	 After that, all the other Israelites came near him, and he commanded them to do everything the L
EXO.34.33	 When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face. 
EXO.34.34	 But whenever Moses went into the L

EXO.35.26	 All the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goats’ hair. 
EXO.35.27	 The leaders brought onyx stones and other precious stones to be set in the ⌊chief priest’s⌋ ephod and breastplate. 
EXO.35.28	 They also brought the spices and the olive oil for the lamps, the anointing oil, and the sweet-smelling incense. 
EXO.35.29	 Every Israelite man and woman who was willing brought all these items to the L

EXO.36.5	 They said, “The people are bringing much more than we need for doing the work the L
EXO.36.6	 So Moses gave instructions to have the following message announced all over camp: “No man or woman needs to make anything more to give as their special contribution to the holy place.” Then the people stopped bringing gifts. 
EXO.36.7	 The material they had was more than enough to do the job.
EXO.36.8	 All the skilled craftsmen among the workers made the inner tent with ten sheets made from fine linen yarn and violet, purple, and bright red yarn. An angel 
EXO.36.9	 Each sheet was 42 feet long and 6 feet wide—all the same size. 
EXO.36.10	 Five of the sheets were sewn together, and the other five were also sewn together. 
EXO.36.11	 Then they made 50 violet loops along the edge of the end sheet in each set, 
EXO.36.12	 placing the loops opposite each other. 
EXO.36.13	 They also made 50 gold fasteners. They used them to link the ⌊two sets of⌋ sheets together so that the inner tent was a single unit.
EXO.36.14	 They made 11 sheets of goats’ hair to form an outer tent over the inner tent. 
EXO.36.15	 Each of the 11 sheets was 45 feet long and 6 feet wide. 
EXO.36.16	 Five of the sheets were sewn together into one set, and the remaining six into another set. 
EXO.36.17	 Then they made 50 loops along the edge of the end sheet in each set. 
EXO.36.18	 They also made 50 bronze fasteners to link the inner tent together as a single unit. 
EXO.36.19	 They made a cover out of rams’ skins that had been dyed red for the outer tent, and over that they put a cover made of fine leather.
EXO.36.20	 They made a framework out of acacia wood for the inner tent. 
EXO.36.21	 Each frame was 15 feet long and 27 inches wide, 
EXO.36.22	 with two identical pegs. They made all the frames for the inner tent this same way. 
EXO.36.23	 They made 20 frames for the south side of the inner tent. 
EXO.36.24	 Then they made 40 silver sockets at the bottom of the 20 frames, two sockets at the bottom of each frame for the two pegs. 
EXO.36.25	 For the north side of the inner tent ⌊they made⌋ 20 frames 
EXO.36.26	 and 40 silver sockets, two at the bottom of each frame. 
EXO.36.27	 They made six frames for the far end, the west side. 
EXO.36.28	 They made two frames for ⌊each of⌋ the corners at the far end of the inner tent. 
EXO.36.29	 They were held together at the bottom and held tightly at the top by a single ring.
EXO.36.30	 There were eight frames with 16 silver sockets, two at the bottom of each frame.
EXO.36.31	 They also made crossbars out of acacia wood. Five were for the frames on one side of the inner tent, 
EXO.36.32	 five were for those on the other side, and five were for the frames on the far side of the inner tent, the west side. 
EXO.36.33	 They made the middle crossbar so that it ran from one end to the other, halfway up the frames. 
EXO.36.34	 They covered the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also covered the crossbars with gold.
EXO.36.35	 They made the canopy out of violet, purple, and bright red yarn and fine linen yarn. An angel design was creatively worked into the fabric. 
EXO.36.36	 They made four posts of acacia wood for it and covered them with gold. They made gold hooks for the posts, and they cast four silver bases for them.
EXO.36.37	 They made a screen out of fine linen yarn for the entrance to the outer tent. It was embroidered with violet, purple, and bright red yarn. 
EXO.36.38	 They also made five posts with hooks for ⌊hanging⌋ the screen. They covered the tops of the posts and the bands with gold, but the five bases for the posts were made of bronze.
EXO.37.1	 Bezalel made the ark out of acacia wood 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high. 
EXO.37.2	 He covered it with pure gold inside and out and put a gold molding around it. 
EXO.37.3	 He cast four gold rings for its four feet, two rings on each side.

EXO.37.6	 He made the throne of mercy out of pure gold 45 inches long and 27 inches wide. 
EXO.37.7	 Then he made two angels 
EXO.37.8	 one on each end. He formed the angels and the throne of mercy out of one piece ⌊of gold⌋. 
EXO.37.9	 The angels had their wings spread above the throne of mercy, overshadowing it. They faced each other, looking at the throne of mercy.
EXO.37.10	 He made the table out of acacia wood 36 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 27 inches high. 
EXO.37.11	 He covered it with pure gold and put a gold molding around it. 
EXO.37.12	 He made a rim 3 inches wide around it and put a gold molding around the rim. 
EXO.37.13	 He cast four gold rings for it and fastened the rings to the four corners, where the four legs were. 
EXO.37.14	 The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles for carrying the table. 
EXO.37.15	 These poles were made out of acacia wood and were covered with gold. 
EXO.37.16	 For the table he made plates, dishes, bowls, and pitchers to be used for pouring wine offerings. All of them were made out of pure gold.
EXO.37.17	 He made the lamp stand out of pure gold. The lamp stand, its base, and its shaft, as well as the flower cups, buds, and petals were hammered out of one piece ⌊of gold⌋. 
EXO.37.18	 Six branches came out of its sides, three branches on one side and three on the other. 
EXO.37.19	 Each of the six branches coming out of the lamp stand had three flower cups shaped like almond blossoms, with buds and petals. 
EXO.37.20	 The lamp stand itself had four flower cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with a bud and petals. 
EXO.37.21	 There was a bud under each of the three pairs of branches coming out of the lamp stand. 
EXO.37.22	 The buds and branches were hammered out of the same piece of pure gold as the lamp stand.
EXO.37.23	 He made the seven lamps, the tongs, and the incense burners out of pure gold. 
EXO.37.24	 The lamp stand and all the utensils were made out of 75 pounds of pure gold.
EXO.37.25	 He made an altar out of acacia wood for burning incense. It was 18 inches square and 36 inches high. The horns and altar were made out of one piece ⌊of wood⌋. 
EXO.37.26	 He covered all of it with pure gold—the top, the sides, and the horns—and he put a gold molding around it. 
EXO.37.27	 He made two gold rings and put them below the molding on opposite sides to hold the poles for carrying it. 
EXO.37.28	 He made the poles out of acacia wood and covered them with gold.
EXO.37.29	 He also had a perfumer make the holy oil to be used for anointing and for the pure, sweet-smelling incense.
EXO.38.1	 He made the altar for burnt offerings out of acacia wood 7½ feet square and 4½ feet high. 
EXO.38.2	 He made a horn at each of its four corners. He made the four horns and the altar out of one piece ⌊of wood⌋ covered with bronze.
EXO.38.3	 He made all the utensils out of bronze: pots, shovels, bowls, forks, and incense burners.
EXO.38.4	 He made a grate for the altar out of bronze mesh, ⌊and put it⌋ under the ledge, halfway up the altar. 
EXO.38.5	 He cast four rings to hold the poles (one for each of the four corners of the bronze grate). 
EXO.38.6	 He made the poles out of acacia wood and covered them with bronze. 
EXO.38.7	 He put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar to carry it. He made the altar out of boards so that it was hollow inside.
EXO.38.8	 He made the basin and stand out of the bronze mirrors given by the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
EXO.38.9	 He also made the courtyard. The south side of the courtyard was 150 feet long and had curtains made out of fine linen yarn, 
EXO.38.10	 ⌊hung⌋ on 20 posts ⌊set in⌋ 20 bronze bases. The hooks and bands on the posts were made of silver. 
EXO.38.11	 The north side was also 150 feet long with 20 posts and 20 bronze bases. The hooks and bands on the posts were made of silver.

EXO.38.18	 The screen for the entrance to the courtyard was made of violet, purple, and bright red yarn embroidered on ⌊fabric made from⌋ fine linen yarn. It was 30 feet long and 7½ feet high, just like the curtains of the courtyard. 
EXO.38.19	 It was hung on four posts ⌊set in⌋ four bronze bases. The hooks and bands on the posts were made of silver. The tops of the posts were covered with silver.
EXO.38.20	 All the pegs for the tent and the surrounding courtyard were made of bronze.
EXO.38.21	 This is the amount of material that was used for the tent (the tent of the words of God’s promise). An inventory was ordered by Moses and carried out by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar, son of the priest Aaron.
EXO.38.22	 Now Bezalel, son of Uri and grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah, made everything the L
EXO.38.23	 He was a jeweler, carpenter, designer, and he knew how to embroider violet, purple, and bright red yarn on fine linen. His assistant was Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan.
EXO.38.24	 The total amount of gold from the offerings presented to the L
EXO.38.25	 The silver collected when the census of the community was taken weighed 7,544 pounds, using the standard weight of the holy place. 
EXO.38.26	 This came to one-fifth of an ounce per person, for everyone counted who was at least 20 years old: 603,550 people. 
EXO.38.27	 He used 7,500 pounds of silver to cast the 100 bases for the holy place and the canopy. This was 75 pounds per base. 
EXO.38.28	 He used 44 pounds of silver to make the hooks and bands for the posts and the coverings for the tops of the posts.
EXO.38.29	 The bronze from the offerings presented to the L
EXO.38.30	 With this he made the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze grate and all its accessories, 
EXO.38.31	 the bases all around the courtyard, the bases for the entrance to the courtyard, all the pegs for the tent, and all the pegs for the surrounding courtyard.
EXO.39.1	 From the violet, purple, and bright red yarn they made special clothes worn for official duties in the holy place. They also made the holy clothes for Aaron. They followed the L
EXO.39.2	 They made the ephod out of fine linen yarn and gold, violet, purple, and bright red yarn. 
EXO.39.3	 They hammered the gold into thin sheets and cut them up. They twisted the gold into threads, which they creatively worked into each strand of the violet, purple, and bright red yarn, and throughout the fine linen. 
EXO.39.4	 They made two shoulder straps attached at the ⌊top⌋ corners so that the ephod could be fastened. 
EXO.39.5	 They made the belt that is attached to the ephod out of the same fabric. They followed the L
EXO.39.6	 They mounted the onyx stones in gold settings, and engraved on them the names of the sons of Israel. 
EXO.39.7	 Then they fastened them on the shoulder straps of the ephod as a reminder of who the Israelites are. They followed the L
EXO.39.8	 They made the breastplate as creatively as they made the ephod. It was made out of gold, violet, purple, and bright red yarn, and of fine linen yarn. 
EXO.39.9	 It was folded in half and was 9 inches square. 
EXO.39.10	 They fastened four rows of precious stones on it. In the first row they put red quartz, topaz, and emerald. 
EXO.39.11	 In the second row they put turquoise, sapphire, and crystal. 
EXO.39.12	 In the third row they put jacinth, agate, and amethyst. 
EXO.39.13	 In the fourth row they put beryl, onyx, and gray quartz. The stones were mounted in gold settings. 
EXO.39.14	 They corresponded to the 12 sons of Israel, by name, each stone engraved (like a signet ring) with the name of one of the 12 tribes.
EXO.39.15	 For the breastplate they made chains out of pure gold, twisted like ropes. 
EXO.39.16	 They made two gold settings and two gold rings and attached the two rings to the ⌊top⌋ two corners of the breastplate. 
EXO.39.17	 They fastened the two gold ropes to the rings at the ⌊top⌋ corners of the breastplate. 
EXO.39.18	 They fastened the other ends of the ropes to the two settings on the shoulder straps of the ephod ⌊so that the breastplate hung⌋ in front of it. 
EXO.39.19	 They made two gold rings and fastened them to the other two corners of the breastplate on the inside edge next to the ephod. 
EXO.39.20	 They made two ⌊more⌋ gold rings and fastened them to the bottom of the shoulder straps on the front of the ephod. This was close to the seam just above the belt of the ephod. 
EXO.39.21	 Then they fastened the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord. So the breastplate was attached just above the belt of the ephod and was held in place. They followed the L
EXO.39.22	 They made the robe that is worn with the ephod, woven entirely of violet yarn. 
EXO.39.23	 The opening in the center of the robe had a finished edge (like a leather collar 
EXO.39.24	 On the hem of the robe they made pomegranates of violet, purple, and bright red yarn, and fine yarn. 
EXO.39.25	 They made bells out of pure gold and fastened them in between the pomegranates all around the hem of the robe. 
EXO.39.26	 A gold bell alternated with a pomegranate all around the hem of the robe that is worn by Aaron when he serves as priest. They followed the L
EXO.39.27	 They wove inner robes out of fine linen for Aaron and his sons. 
EXO.39.28	 They also made the chief priest’s turban and the other beautiful turbans out of fine linen. They made the undergarments and belt out of fine linen yarn. 
EXO.39.29	 The belt was embroidered with violet, purple, and bright red yarn. They followed the L
EXO.39.30	 They made the flower-shaped medallion (the holy crown) out of pure gold and engraved on it (as on a signet ring): Holy to the L

EXO.39.32	 So all the work on the inner tent (the tent of meeting) was now done. The Israelites followed all the L
EXO.39.33	 Then they brought everything to Moses—the inner tent, the outer tent and all its furnishings, the fasteners, frames, crossbars, posts, sockets,

NUM.13.7	 Igal, son of Joseph, from the tribe of Issachar;
NUM.13.8	 Hoshea, son of Nun, from the tribe of Ephraim;

NUM.13.10	 Gaddiel, son of Sodi, from the tribe of Zebulun;

NUM.13.14	 Nahbi, son of Vophsi, from the tribe of Naphtali;
NUM.13.15	 Geuel, son of Machi, from the tribe of Gad.
NUM.13.16	 These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. But Moses gave Hoshea, son of Nun, the name Joshua.
NUM.13.17	 When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he told them, “Go through the Negev and then into the mountain region. 
NUM.13.18	 See what the land is like and whether the people living there are strong or weak, few or many. 
NUM.13.19	 Is the land they live in good or bad? Do their cities have walls around them or not? 
NUM.13.20	 Is the soil rich or poor? Does the land have trees or not? Do your best to bring back some fruit from the land.” (It was the season when grapes were beginning to ripen.)
NUM.13.21	 So the men explored the land from the Desert of Zin to the border of Hamath. 
NUM.13.22	 They went through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai lived. They are descendants of Anak. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
NUM.13.23	 When they came to the Eshcol Valley, they cut off a branch with only one bunch of grapes on it. They carried it on a pole between two of them. They also brought some pomegranates and figs. 
NUM.13.24	 So they called that valley Eshcol [Bunch of Grapes] because of the bunch of grapes the Israelites cut off there.
NUM.13.25	 Forty days later, they came back from exploring the land. 
NUM.13.26	 They came back to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of Israel at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. They gave their report and showed them the fruit from the land.
NUM.13.27	 This is what they reported to Moses: “We went to the land where you sent us. It really is a land flowing with milk and honey. Here’s some of its fruit. 
NUM.13.28	 But the people who live there are strong, and the cities have walls and are very large. We even saw the descendants of Anak there. 
NUM.13.29	 The Amalekites live in the Negev. The Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the mountain region. And the Canaanites live along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and all along the Jordan River.”
NUM.13.30	 Caleb told the people to be quiet and listen to Moses. Caleb said, “Let’s go now and take possession of the land. We should be more than able to conquer it.”
NUM.13.31	 But the men who had gone with him said, “We can’t attack those people! They’re too strong for us!” 
NUM.13.32	 So they began to spread lies among the Israelites about the land they had explored. They said, “The land we explored is one that devours those who live there. All the people we saw there are very tall. 
NUM.13.33	 We saw Nephilim there. (The descendants of Anak are Nephilim.) We felt as small as grasshoppers, and that’s how we must have looked to them.”
NUM.14.1	 Then all the people in the Israelite community raised their voices and cried out loud all that night. 
NUM.14.2	 They complained to Moses and Aaron, “If only we had died in Egypt or this desert!

NUM.14.4	 They said to each other, “Let’s choose a leader and go back to Egypt.”
NUM.14.5	 Immediately, Moses and Aaron bowed with their faces touching the ground in front of the whole community of Israel assembled there. 
NUM.14.6	 At the same time, two of those who had explored the land, Joshua (son of Nun) and Caleb (son of Jephunneh), tore their clothes in despair. 
NUM.14.7	 They said to the whole community of Israel, “The land we explored is very good.

NUM.14.24	 But because my servant Caleb has a different attitude and has wholeheartedly followed me, I’ll bring him to the land he already explored. His descendants will possess it. 
NUM.14.25	 (The Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys.) Tomorrow you must turn around, go back into the desert, and follow the road that goes to the Red Sea.”

NUM.14.39	 When Moses told these things to all the Israelites, the people mourned bitterly, as if someone had died.

NUM.20.21	 Since the Edomites refused to let Israel go through their territory, the Israelites turned around and went a different way.

NUM.21.23	 Sihon wouldn’t let Israel pass through his territory. Sihon gathered all his troops and came out into the desert to attack Israel. When Sihon’s troops came to Jahaz, they fought against Israel. 
NUM.21.24	 But Israel defeated them in battle and took possession of their land from the Arnon Valley to the Jabbok River. ⌊They stopped at⌋ the border of the Ammon because it was fortified. 
NUM.21.25	 Israel took all those Amorite cities, including Heshbon and all its villages, and lived in them. 
NUM.21.26	 Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites. He had fought the former king of Moab and had taken all his land up to the Arnon Valley.

NUM.21.31	 So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.32	 After Moses sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its cities and villages and forced out the Amorites who were there.

NUM.22.4	At that time Balak, son of Zippor, was king of Moab. 
NUM.22.5	 He sent messengers to summon Balaam, son of Beor, who was at Pethor, on the Euphrates River, in the land where his people lived. Balak’s message was, “A nation has just come here from Egypt. They’ve spread out all over the countryside and are setting up their camp here in front of me. 
NUM.22.6	 Please come and curse these people for me, because they are too strong for me. Maybe then I’ll be able to defeat them and force them out of the country. I know that whomever you bless is blessed and whomever you curse is cursed.”
NUM.22.7	 The leaders of Moab and Midian left, taking money with them to pay for Balaam’s services. They came to Balaam and told him what Balak had said.

NUM.22.38	 Balaam replied, “Well, I’ve come to you now. But I can’t say whatever I want to. I can only say what God tells me to say.”
NUM.22.39	 Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	 Balak sacrificed cattle, sheep, and goats, and sent some of the meat to Balaam and the princes who were with him.
NUM.22.41	 The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal. From there he could see the outskirts of the Israelites’ camp.
NUM.23.1	 Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”

DEU.1.8	 I’m giving you this land. Enter, and take possession of the land the L
DEU.1.9	 At that time I said to you, “I’m not able to take care of you by myself. 
DEU.1.10	 The L
DEU.1.11	 May the L
DEU.1.12	 How can I take care of your problems, your troubles, and your disagreements all by myself? 
DEU.1.13	 From each of your tribes, choose some men who are wise, intelligent, and experienced, and I’ll appoint them to be your leaders.”
DEU.1.14	 You agreed that this was a good idea.
DEU.1.15	 So I took the heads of your tribes who were wise and experienced men and made them officers for each of your tribes. I put them in charge of groups of 1,000, or 100, or 50, or 10 people. 
DEU.1.16	 Also at that time I gave these instructions to your judges: “Hear the cases that your people bring. Judge each case fairly, no matter whether it is ⌊a dispute⌋ between two Israelites or ⌊a dispute⌋ between an Israelite and a non-Israelite. 
DEU.1.17	 Be impartial in your decisions. Listen to the least important people the same way you listen to the most important people. Never be afraid of anyone, since your decisions come from God. You may bring me any case that’s too hard for you, and I will hear it.” 
DEU.1.18	 So I told you how to handle these situations.
DEU.1.19	 So we left Mount Horeb, as the L
DEU.1.20	 Then I said to you, “We have come to the mountain region of the Amorites, which the L
DEU.1.21	 The L
DEU.1.22	 All of you came to me and said, “Let’s send men ahead of us to gather information about the land for us. Have them report to us about the route we should take and the cities we’ll come to.”
DEU.1.23	 It seemed like a good idea to me. So I chose 12 of your men, one from each tribe. 
DEU.1.24	 They left and went into the mountains. When they came to the Eshcol Valley, they explored it. 
DEU.1.25	 They took some of the region’s fruit with them and brought it back to us. They reported, “The land that the L
DEU.1.26	 But you rebelled against the command of the L
DEU.1.27	 You complained in your tents and said, “The L
DEU.1.28	 Where are we going anyway? Our own men have discouraged us by saying, ‘The people there are taller and stronger than we are. The cities are big with sky-high walls! We even saw the people of Anak there.’ ”
DEU.1.29	 Then I said to you, “Don’t tremble. Don’t be afraid of them. 
DEU.1.30	 The L
DEU.1.31	 and in the desert.” There you saw how the L
DEU.1.32	 In spite of this, you didn’t trust the L
DEU.1.33	 who went ahead of you to find places for you to camp. He appeared in a column of fire at night and in a column of smoke during the day to show you which route to take.
DEU.1.34	 When the L
DEU.1.35	 “Not one of these evil people will ever see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors, 
DEU.1.36	 except Caleb, son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give the land that he set his feet on to him and his descendants, because he wholeheartedly followed the L
DEU.1.37	 The L
DEU.1.38	 But your assistant Joshua, son of Nun, will go there. Encourage him, because he will help Israel take possession of the land. 
DEU.1.39	 Although you thought the little children would be captured in war, your children, who are still too young to know the difference between good and evil, will enter that land. I will give it to them, and they will take possession of it. 
DEU.1.40	 Turn around, go back into the desert, and follow the road that goes to the Red Sea.”
DEU.1.41	 You responded, “We have sinned against the L
DEU.1.42	 But the L
DEU.1.43	 I told you, but you wouldn’t listen. You defied the L
DEU.1.44	 The Amorites who lived there came out and attacked you and chased you like a swarm of bees. They defeated you, chasing you from Seir all the way to Hormah. 
DEU.1.45	 When you came back, you cried to the L
DEU.1.46	 That’s why you stayed in Kadesh as long as you did.
DEU.2.1	 We went back into the desert, following the road that goes to the Red Sea as the L
DEU.2.2	 The L
DEU.2.3	 “You’ve traveled around this region long enough. Now go north. 
DEU.2.4	 Give the people these instructions: ‘You’re going to pass through the territory of your relatives, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They’ll be afraid of you, but be very careful. 
DEU.2.5	 Don’t start a fight with them, because I’m not giving you any of their land—not even enough to stand on. I’ve given Esau’s descendants the region of Mount Seir as their property. 
DEU.2.6	 You must pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’ ”
DEU.2.7	 The L
DEU.2.8	 So we passed by our relatives, the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir. We turned off the road that goes through the plains to Elath and Ezion Geber and took the road that goes through the desert of Moab.
DEU.2.9	 The L
DEU.2.10	 The Emites used to live there. These people were as strong, as numerous, and as tall as the people of Anak. 
DEU.2.11	 They were thought to be Rephaim, like the people of Anak, but the Moabites called them Emites. 
DEU.2.12	 The Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau claimed their land, wiped them out, and took their place, as Israel did in the land that the L
DEU.2.13	 Then the L
DEU.2.13	So we crossed the Zered River. 
DEU.2.14	 Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered River. During that time all our soldiers from that generation died, as the L
DEU.2.15	 In fact, it was the L
DEU.2.16	 When the last of these soldiers had died, 
DEU.2.17	 the L
DEU.2.18	 “Today you are going to pass by the border of Moab at Ar. 
DEU.2.19	 When you come near the Ammonites, don’t bother them or start a fight with them. I’m not giving you any of the land that I have already given to the descendants of Lot as their property.”
DEU.2.20	 This land was thought of as the land of the Rephaim who used to live there, but the Ammonites called them Zamzummim. 
DEU.2.21	 These people were as strong, as numerous, and as tall as the people of Anak. But the L
DEU.2.22	 The L
DEU.2.23	 The same thing happened to the Avvites who lived in villages as far away as Gaza. The Caphtorites, who came from Crete, wiped them out and took their place.
DEU.2.24	 ⌊The L
DEU.2.25	 Today I will start to make all the people under heaven terrified of you. When they hear about you, they will tremble and shake because of you.”
DEU.2.26	 From the desert of Kedemoth, I sent messengers to King Sihon of Heshbon with the following offer of peace: 
DEU.2.27	 “If you allow us to travel through your country, we’ll go straight through and won’t ever leave the road. 
DEU.2.28	 We’ll pay you in silver for the food we eat and the water we drink. Please let us go through, 
DEU.2.29	 as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us. We’ll keep going until we cross the Jordan River into the land the L
DEU.2.30	 But King Sihon of Heshbon wouldn’t allow us to pass through. The L
DEU.2.31	 The L
DEU.2.32	 Sihon and all his troops came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz. 
DEU.2.33	 The L
DEU.2.34	 At that time we captured all his cities and claimed them for God by destroying men, women, and children. There were no survivors. 
DEU.2.35	 However, we did loot the cities that we captured, taking the cattle and goods. 
DEU.2.36	 From Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley and the city in that valley as far as Gilead, no city had walls that could keep us out. The L
DEU.2.37	 But the L
DEU.3.1	 Next we turned and followed the road that goes to Bashan. King Og of Bashan and all his troops came to fight us at Edrei. 
DEU.3.2	 The L
DEU.3.3	 So the L
DEU.3.4	 At that time we captured all of his cities. There wasn’t a city we didn’t take. We captured a total of 60 cities—the whole territory of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.5	 All of these cities were fortified with high walls and double-door gates with bars across the gates. We also captured a large number of unwalled villages. 
DEU.3.6	 We claimed them all for God, destroying every city, including men, women, and children—as we did to King Sihon of Heshbon. 
DEU.3.7	 However, we did loot the cities, taking all of the cattle and goods.
DEU.3.8	 We took the land of the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River, from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon. 
DEU.3.9	 (The Sidonians call Mount Hermon by the name Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.) 
DEU.3.10	 We took all of the cities of the plateau, all of Gilead, and all of Bashan as far as Salcah and Edrei, cities of Og’s kingdom in Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	 (Of the Rephaim only King Og of Bashan was left. His bed was made of iron and was more than 13 feet long and 6 feet wide. It is still in the Ammon ite city of Rabbah.)
DEU.3.12	 At that time we took possession of this land. I gave the tribes of Reuben and Gad the land north of Aroer near the Arnon Valley and half of the mountain region of Gilead with its cities. 
DEU.3.13	 I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan ruled by Og to half of the tribe of Manasseh. (The whole territory of Argob in Bashan used to be called the land of the Rephaim. 
DEU.3.14	 Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole territory of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites. The settlements in Bashan he named Havvoth Jair after himself. This is still their name today.) 
DEU.3.15	 I gave Gilead to Machir. 
DEU.3.16	 I gave the tribes of Reuben and Gad some of Gilead from the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley is the border) to the Jabbok River, which is the border of Ammon. 
DEU.3.17	 Their land included the plains around the Jordan River. The western border was the river, from the Sea of Galilee to the Sea of the Plains (the Dead Sea), which is near Mount Pisgah on the east.
DEU.3.18	 I gave the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh this command: “The L
DEU.3.19	 I know you have a lot of livestock. Your wives, children, and livestock must stay here in the cities that I gave you. 
DEU.3.20	 Your soldiers will go with the other Israelites until they take possession of the land the L
DEU.3.21	 I also gave Joshua this command: “You have seen with your own eyes everything that the L
DEU.3.22	 Don’t be afraid of them, because the L
DEU.3.23	 Then I pleaded with the L
DEU.3.24	 “Almighty L
DEU.3.25	 Please let me go over and see the beautiful land on the other side of the Jordan River—those beautiful mountains in Lebanon.”
DEU.3.26	 The L
DEU.3.27	 Go to the top of Mount Pisgah, and look west, north, south, and east. You may look at the land, but you will never cross the Jordan River. 
DEU.3.28	 Give instructions to Joshua. Encourage and strengthen him, because he will lead these people across ⌊the Jordan River⌋, and he will help them take possession of the land you see.”
DEU.3.29	 So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
DEU.4.1	 Israel, listen to the laws and rules I am about to teach you. Obey them so that you will live and be able to enter and take possession of the land that the L
DEU.4.2	 Never add anything to what I command you, or take anything away from it. Then you will be able to obey the commands of the L
DEU.4.3	 With your own eyes you saw what the L
DEU.4.4	 But you were loyal to the L
DEU.4.5	 I have taught you laws and rules as the L
DEU.4.6	 Faithfully obey these laws. This will show the people of the world your wisdom and insight. When they hear about all these laws, they will say, “What wise and insightful people there are in this great nation!”
DEU.4.7	 What great nation ever had their gods as near to them as the L
DEU.4.8	 Or what other great nation has such fair laws and rules as all these teachings I am giving you today?
DEU.4.9	 However, be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you don’t forget the things which you have seen with your own eyes. Don’t let them fade from your memory as long as you live. Teach them to your children and grandchildren. 
DEU.4.10	 Never forget the day you stood in front of the L
DEU.4.11	 So you came and stood at the foot of the mountain, which was on fire with flames shooting into the sky. It was dark, cloudy, and gloomy. 
DEU.4.12	 The L
DEU.4.13	 The L
DEU.4.14	 The L
DEU.4.15	 You didn’t see the L
DEU.4.16	 that you don’t become corrupt and make your own carved idols. Don’t make statues that represent men or women, 
DEU.4.17	 any animal on earth, any creature with wings that flies, 
DEU.4.18	 any creature that crawls on the ground, or any fish in the water. 
DEU.4.19	 Don’t let yourselves be tempted to worship and serve what you see in the sky—the sun, the moon, the stars, or anything else. The L
DEU.4.20	 But you are the people the L
DEU.4.21	 The L
DEU.4.22	 I’m going to die in this land and not cross the Jordan River, but you’re going to go across and take possession of that good land. 
DEU.4.23	 Be careful that you don’t forget the promise 
DEU.4.24	 The L
DEU.4.25	 Even when you have children and grandchildren and have grown old in that land, don’t become corrupt and make carved idols or statues that represent anything. I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today: 
DEU.4.26	 you will quickly disappear from the land you’re going to possess on the other side of the Jordan River. You won’t live very long there. You’ll be completely wiped out. 
DEU.4.27	 The L
DEU.4.28	 There you will worship wooden and stone gods made by human hands. These gods can’t see, hear, eat, or smell.
DEU.4.29	 But if you look for the L
DEU.4.30	 When you’re in distress and all these things happen to you, then you will finally come back to the L
DEU.4.31	 The L
DEU.4.32	 Search the distant past, long before your time. Start from the very day God created people on earth. Search from one end of heaven to the other. Has anything as great as this ever happened before, or has anything like it ever been heard of? 
DEU.4.33	 Have any ⌊other⌋ people ever heard God speak from a fire and lived? You did! 
DEU.4.34	 Or has any god ever tried to come and take one nation away from another for himself? The L
DEU.4.35	 You were shown these things so that you would know that the L
DEU.4.36	 He let you hear his voice from heaven so that he could instruct you. He showed you his great fire on earth, and you heard him speak from the column of fire. 
DEU.4.37	 Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants, he was with you as he brought you out of Egypt by his great power. 
DEU.4.38	 He forced nations greater and stronger than you out of your way to bring you into their land and give it to you. This land is your own possession today.
DEU.4.39	 Remember today, and never forget that the L
DEU.4.40	 Obey his laws and commands which I’m giving you today. Then things will go well for you and your descendants. You will live for a long time in the land. The L
DEU.4.41	 Then Moses set aside three cities on the east side of the Jordan River. 
DEU.4.42	 Those who unintentionally killed someone whom they had never hated could flee to one of these cities and save their lives. 
DEU.4.43	 The cities were Bezer on the desert plateau for the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead for the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan for the tribe of Manasseh.
DEU.4.44	 This is what Moses taught the people of Israel. 
DEU.4.45	 These are the commandments, laws, and rules Moses gave the Israelites after they had left Egypt. 
DEU.4.46	 He gave these to the people when they were east of the Jordan River in the valley near Beth Peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon. Moses and Israel defeated him after they left Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	 They took possession of his land and the land of King Og of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites who were east of the Jordan River. 
DEU.4.48	 This land went from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley to Mount Siyon (that is, Mount Hermon). 
DEU.4.49	 It included all the plains on the east side of the Jordan River as far as the Dead Sea at the foot of the slopes of Mount Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	 Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: Israel, listen to the laws and rules I’m telling you today. Learn them and faithfully obey them.
DEU.5.2	 The L
DEU.5.3	 He didn’t make this promise to our ancestors, but to all of us who are alive here today. 
DEU.5.4	 The L
DEU.5.5	 I stood between the L
DEU.5.6	 “I am the L
DEU.5.7	 “Never have any other gods. 
DEU.5.8	 Never make your own carved idols or statues that represent any creature in the sky, on the earth, or in the water. 
DEU.5.9	 Never worship them or serve them, because I, the L
DEU.5.10	 But I show mercy to thousands of generations of those who love me and obey my commandments.
DEU.5.11	 “Never use the name of the L
DEU.5.12	 “Observe the day of worship as a holy day. This is what the L
DEU.5.13	 You have six days to do all your work. 
DEU.5.14	 The seventh day is the day of worship dedicated to the L
DEU.5.15	 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the L
DEU.5.16	 “Honor your father and your mother as the L
DEU.5.17	 “Never murder.
DEU.5.18	 “Never commit adultery.
DEU.5.19	 “Never steal.
DEU.5.20	 “Never avoid the truth when you testify about your neighbor.
DEU.5.21	 “Never desire to take your neighbor’s wife away from him.
DEU.5.21	“Never long for your neighbor’s household, his field, his male or female slave, his ox, his donkey, or anything else that belongs to him.”
DEU.5.22	 These are the commandments the L
DEU.5.23	 But when you heard the voice coming from the darkness and saw the mountain blazing with fire, all the leaders and heads of your tribes came to me. 
DEU.5.24	 You said, “The L
DEU.5.25	 Why should we die? This great fire will consume us! If we continue to hear the voice of the L
DEU.5.26	 Who has ever heard the voice of the living God speak from a fire, as we did, and lived? 
DEU.5.27	 ⌊Moses,⌋ go and listen to everything that the L
DEU.5.28	 When the L
DEU.5.29	 If only they would fear me and obey all my commandments as long as they live! Then things would go well for them and their children forever.
DEU.5.30	 “Tell the people to go back to their tents. 
DEU.5.31	 But you stay here with me. I will give you all the commands, laws, and rules that you must teach them to obey in the land which I’m giving them to possess.”
DEU.5.32	 So be careful to do what the L
DEU.5.33	 Follow all the directions the L
DEU.6.1	 These are the commands, laws, and rules the L
DEU.6.2	 As long as you live, you, your children, and your grandchildren must fear the L
DEU.6.3	 Listen, Israel, and be careful to obey these laws. Then things will go well for you and your population will increase in a land flowing with milk and honey, as the L
DEU.6.4	 Listen, Israel: The L
DEU.6.5	 Love the L
DEU.6.6	 Take to heart these words that I give you today. 
DEU.6.7	 Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you’re at home or away, when you lie down or get up. 
DEU.6.8	 ⌊Write them down, and⌋ tie them around your wrist, and wear them as headbands as a reminder. 
DEU.6.9	 Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.
DEU.6.10	 The L
DEU.6.11	 Your houses will be filled with all kinds of things that you didn’t put there. You will have cisterns that you didn’t dig and vineyards and olive trees that you didn’t plant. After you have eaten all that you want, 
DEU.6.12	 be careful that you don’t forget the L
DEU.6.13	 You must fear the L
DEU.6.14	 Never worship any of the gods worshiped by the people around you. 
DEU.6.15	 If you do, the L
DEU.6.16	 Never test the L
DEU.6.17	 Be sure to obey the commands of the L
DEU.6.18	 Do what the L
DEU.6.19	 You will see the L
DEU.6.20	 In the future your children will ask you, “What do these regulations, laws, and rules which the L
DEU.6.21	 Tell them, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt, but the L
DEU.6.22	 Right before our eyes the L

DEU.6.25	 This is how we’ll have the L
DEU.7.1	 The L
DEU.7.2	 When the L
DEU.7.3	 Never marry any of them. Never let your daughters marry their sons or your sons marry their daughters. 
DEU.7.4	 These people will turn your children away from me to worship other gods. Then the L
DEU.7.5	 But this is what you must do to these people: Tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah, and burn their idols. 
DEU.7.6	 You are a holy people, who belong to the L
DEU.7.7	 The L
DEU.7.8	 You were chosen because the L
DEU.7.9	 Keep in mind that the L
DEU.7.10	 But he sends destruction to pay back everyone who hates him. He never takes long to pay back anyone who hates him.
DEU.7.11	 So obey the commands, laws, and rules I’m giving you today.
DEU.7.12	 If you listen to these rules and faithfully obey them, the L
DEU.7.13	 He will love you, bless you, and increase the number of your descendants. He will bless you with children. He will bless your land with produce: grain, new wine, and olive oil. He will bless your herds with calves, and your flocks with lambs and kids. This will all happen in the land the L
DEU.7.14	 You will be blessed more than any other people. Your men and women will be able to have children, and your animals will be able to have offspring. 
DEU.7.15	 The L
DEU.7.16	 You must destroy all the people the L
DEU.7.17	 You may say to yourselves, “These nations outnumber us. How can we force them out?” 
DEU.7.18	 Don’t be afraid of them. Remember what the L
DEU.7.19	 You saw with your own eyes the terrible plagues, the miraculous signs, and the amazing things the L
DEU.7.20	 The L
DEU.7.21	 Don’t be afraid of them, because the L
DEU.7.22	 Little by little he will force these nations out of your way. You won’t be able to wipe them out quickly. Otherwise, you would be overrun with wild animals. 
DEU.7.23	 The L
DEU.7.24	 He will hand their kings over to you, and no one on earth will even remember their names. No one will be able to stop you. You will destroy them all. 
DEU.7.25	 Burn their idols. Don’t ever long for the silver and gold on these idols or take any of it for yourselves. It might be a trap for you. Besides, these idols are disgusting to the L
DEU.7.26	 Never bring a disgusting idol into your house. If you do, you and the idol will be destroyed. Consider it detestable and disgusting. It must be destroyed.”
DEU.8.1	 Be careful to obey every command I give you today. Then you will live, and your population will increase. You will enter and take possession of the land that the L
DEU.8.2	 Remember that for 40 years the L
DEU.8.3	 So he made you suffer from hunger and then fed you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had seen before. He did this to teach you that a person cannot live on bread alone but on every word that the L
DEU.8.4	 Your clothes didn’t wear out, and your feet didn’t swell these past 40 years. 
DEU.8.5	 Learn this lesson by heart: The L
DEU.8.6	 Obey the commands of the L
DEU.8.7	 The L
DEU.8.8	 The land has wheat and barley, grapevines, fig trees, and pomegranates. The land has honey and olive trees for olive oil. 
DEU.8.9	 The land will have enough food for you, and you will have everything you need. The land has rocks with iron ore, and you will be able to mine copper ore in the hills. 
DEU.8.10	 When you have eaten all you want, thank the L
DEU.8.11	 Be careful that you don’t forget the L
DEU.8.12	 You will eat all you want. You will build nice houses and live in them. 
DEU.8.13	 Your herds and flocks, silver and gold, and everything else you have will increase. 
DEU.8.14	 When this happens, be careful that you don’t become arrogant and forget the L
DEU.8.15	 He was the one who led you through that vast and dangerous desert—a thirsty and arid land, with poisonous snakes and scorpions. He was the one who made water come out of solid rock for you. 
DEU.8.16	 He was the one who fed you in the desert with manna, which your ancestors had never seen. He did this in order to humble you and test you. But he also did this so that things would go well for you in the end. 
DEU.8.17	 You may say to yourselves, “I became wealthy because of my own ability and strength.” 
DEU.8.18	 But remember the L
DEU.8.19	 I warn you today that if you forget the L
DEU.8.20	 The L
DEU.9.1	 Listen, Israel, you’re about to cross the Jordan River. You’ll be forcing out nations that are larger and stronger than you, with big cities that have sky-high walls. 
DEU.9.2	 Their people are tall and strong. They’re descendants of Anak. You know all about them. You’ve also heard it said, “Who can oppose the descendants of Anak?” 
DEU.9.3	 Realize today that the L
DEU.9.4	 When the L
DEU.9.5	 It’s not because you’ve been living right or because you’re so honest that you’re entering to take possession of their land. It’s because these people are so wicked that the L
DEU.9.6	 So understand this: It’s not because you’ve been living right that the L
DEU.9.7	 Never forget how you made the L
DEU.9.8	 Even at Mount Horeb you made the L
DEU.9.9	 When I went up on the mountain to get the stone tablets, the tablets of the promise that the L
DEU.9.10	 Then the L
DEU.9.11	 At the end of the 40 days and 40 nights, the L
DEU.9.12	 He told me, “Leave right away. Your people whom you brought out of Egypt have ruined ⌊everything⌋. They’ve quickly turned from the way I commanded them to live. They’ve made an idol for themselves.”

DEU.9.16	 Then I saw that you had sinned against the L

DEU.10.1	 At that time the L
DEU.10.2	 I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the first tablets, which you smashed. Then you will put them in the ark.”
DEU.10.3	 I made an ark out of acacia wood. I cut two ⌊more⌋ stone tablets like the first ones. I carried the two tablets up the mountain. 
DEU.10.4	 The L
DEU.10.5	 I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made. They are still there, where the L

DEU.11.5	 You saw what he did for you in the desert until you came here. 
DEU.11.6	 You also saw what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, from the tribe of Reuben. In the middle of all the Israelites the ground opened up and swallowed them, their families, their tents, and every living creature with them. 
DEU.11.7	 You saw with your own eyes all these spectacular things that the L

DEU.15.9	 When the seventh year—the year when payments on debts are canceled—is near, you might be stingy toward poor Israelites and give them nothing. Be careful not to think these worthless thoughts. The poor will complain to the L

DEU.15.12	 Whenever Hebrew men or women are sold to you as slaves, they will be your slaves for six years. In the seventh year you must let them go free. 
DEU.15.13	 But when you let them go, don’t send them away empty-handed.

DEU.15.17	 Then take an awl and pierce it through his ear lobe into a door, and he will be your slave for life. Do the same to a female slave ⌊if she doesn’t want to leave⌋.
DEU.15.18	 If you have to let your slave go free, it won’t be a hardship for you. It would have cost you twice as much to hire someone to do the same work for those six years. Besides, the L

DEU.16.4	 There should be no yeast anywhere in your land for seven days. Never leave until morning any of the meat you slaughter on the evening of the first day.

DEU.17.4	 When you are told about it, investigate it thoroughly. If it’s true and it can be proven that this disgusting thing has been done in Israel, 
DEU.17.5	 then bring the man or woman who did this evil thing to the gates of your city, and stone that person to death. 
DEU.17.6	 The person can only be sentenced to death on the testimony of two or three witnesses, but no one should ever be sentenced to death on the testimony of only one witness. 
DEU.17.7	 The witnesses must start the execution, then all the other people will join them in putting the person to death. You must get rid of this evil.
DEU.17.8	 There may be a case that is too hard for you to decide. It may involve murder, assault, or a dispute—any case which may be brought to court in your cities. Take this case to the place that the L
DEU.17.9	 Go to the Levitical priests and the judge who is serving at that time. Ask for their opinion, and they will give you their verdict

DEU.17.12	 If anyone deliberately disobeys the priest (who serves the L

DEU.17.16	 The king must never own a large number of horses or make the people return to Egypt to get more horses. The L
DEU.17.17	 The king must never have a large number of wives, or he will turn away ⌊from God⌋. And he must never own a lot of gold and silver.
DEU.17.18	 When he becomes king, he should have the Levitical priests make him a copy of these teachings on a scroll. 
DEU.17.19	 He must keep it with him and read it his entire life. He will learn to fear the L
DEU.17.20	 Then he won’t think he’s better than the rest of his people, and he won’t disobey these commands in any way. So he and his sons will rule for a long time in Israel.
DEU.18.1	 The Levitical priests—in fact, the whole tribe of Levi—will receive no land or property of their own like the rest of the Israelites. They will eat what has been sacrificed to the L
DEU.18.2	 So the Levites will have no land of their own like the other Israelites. The L
DEU.18.3	 This is what the people owe the priests whenever they sacrifice an ox, a sheep, or a goat: the shoulder, jaws, and stomach. 
DEU.18.4	 Also, give them the first produce harvested: grain, new wine, olive oil, and the first wool you shear from your sheep. 
DEU.18.5	 Out of all your tribes, the L
DEU.18.6	 A Levite from any of your cities in Israel may come from where he has been living to the place the L

DEU.18.20	 But any prophet who dares to say something in my name that I didn’t command him to say or who speaks in the name of other gods must die.”

DEU.19.5	 Suppose two people go into the woods to cut wood. As one of them swings the ax to cut down a tree, the head flies off the handle, hits, and kills the other person. The one who accidentally killed the other person may run to one of these cities and save his life. 
DEU.19.6	 Otherwise, in a rage the relative who has the authority to avenge the death will pursue him. If the place is too far away, the relative may catch up with him and take his life even though he didn’t deserve the death penalty, because in the past he never hated the person he killed. 
DEU.19.7	 This is why I’m commanding you to set aside three cities for yourselves.
DEU.19.8	 The L
DEU.19.9	 He may do this because you faithfully obey all these commands I am now giving you—to love the L
DEU.19.10	 That way, innocent people won’t be killed in the land that the L
DEU.19.11	 Suppose someone hates another person, waits in ambush for him, attacks him, takes his life, and runs to one of these cities. 
DEU.19.12	 If someone does this, the leaders of your city must send for that person. They must take him from that city and hand him over to the relative who has the authority to avenge the death. He must die. 
DEU.19.13	 They must have no pity on him. The guilt of murdering an innocent person must be removed from Israel. Then things will go well for Israel.
DEU.19.14	 Never move your neighbor’s original boundary marker on any property in the land that the L
DEU.19.15	 One witness is never enough to convict someone of a crime, offense, or sin he may have committed. Cases must be settled based on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
DEU.19.16	 This is what you must do whenever a witness takes the stand to accuse a person falsely of a crime. 
DEU.19.17	 The two people involved must stand in the L
DEU.19.18	 The judges must make a thorough investigation. If it is found that the witness lied when he testified against the other Israelite, 
DEU.19.19	 then do to him what he planned to do to the other person. You must get rid of this evil. 
DEU.19.20	 When the rest of the people hear about this, they will be afraid. Never again will such an evil thing be done among you. 
DEU.19.21	 Have no pity on him: ⌊Take⌋ a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, and a foot for a foot.
DEU.20.1	 When you go to war against your enemies, you may see horses, chariots, and armies larger than yours. Don’t be afraid of them, because the L
DEU.20.2	 Before the battle starts, a priest must come and speak to the troops.

DEU.20.7	 If you are engaged to a woman but have not married her, you may go home. Otherwise, you might die in battle, and someone else will marry her.”
DEU.20.8	 The officers should also tell the troops, “If you are afraid or have lost your courage, you may go home. Then you won’t ruin the morale of the other Israelites.” 
DEU.20.9	 When the officers finish speaking to the troops, they should appoint commanders to lead them.
DEU.20.10	 When you approach a city to attack it, offer its people a peaceful way to surrender. 
DEU.20.11	 If they accept it and open ⌊their gates⌋ to you, then all the people there will be made to do forced labor and serve you.

DEU.20.19	 This is what you must do whenever you blockade a city for a long time in order to capture it in war. Don’t harm any of its fruit trees with an ax. You can eat the fruit. Never cut those trees down, because the trees of the field are not people you have come to blockade. 
DEU.20.20	 You may destroy trees that you know are not fruit trees. You may cut them down and use them in your blockade until you capture the city.
DEU.21.1	 This is what you must do if you find a murder victim lying in a field in the land that the L
DEU.21.2	 your leaders and judges must go and measure the distance from the body to each of the neighboring cities. 
DEU.21.3	 When it has been determined which city is nearest the body, the leaders from that city must choose a heifer that has never been put to work and never worn a yoke.
DEU.21.4	 The leaders of that city will bring the heifer down to a river, to a location where the land hasn’t been plowed or planted. At the river they must break the heifer’s neck. 
DEU.21.5	 The priests, the descendants of Levi, must come forward. The L

DEU.21.14	 But if it happens that you are no longer pleased with her, let her go wherever she wants. You must never sell her or mistreat her as if she were a slave,
DEU.21.15	 A man might have two wives and love one but not the other. Both wives might have children, and the firstborn son might belong to the wife that the man doesn’t love. 
DEU.21.16	 When the day comes for the father to give his sons their inheritance, he can’t treat the son of the wife he loves as if that son were the firstborn. This would show a total disregard for the real firstborn (the son of the wife he doesn’t love). 
DEU.21.17	 Instead, he must recognize the son of the wife he doesn’t love as the firstborn. He must give that son a double portion of whatever he owns. That son is the very first son he had. The rights of the firstborn son are his.
DEU.21.18	 Parents might have a stubborn and rebellious son who doesn’t obey them. Even though they punish him, he still won’t listen to them. 
DEU.21.19	 His father and mother must take him to the leaders of the city at the city gate. 
DEU.21.20	 They will say to the leaders of the city, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He won’t obey us. He eats too much and is a drunk.” 
DEU.21.21	 All the men of the city should stone him to death. You must get rid of this evil. When all Israel hears about it, they will be afraid.
DEU.21.22	 When a convicted person is put to death,

DEU.22.1	 If you see another Israelite’s ox or sheep out where it doesn’t belong, don’t pretend that you don’t see it. Make sure you take it back. 
DEU.22.2	 If the owner doesn’t live near you or you don’t know who owns it, take the animal home with you. Keep it until the owner comes looking for it. Then give it back. 
DEU.22.3	 Do the same if you find a donkey, some clothes, or anything else that another Israelite may have lost. Don’t pretend that you don’t know what to do.
DEU.22.4	 If you see another Israelite’s donkey or ox lying on the road, don’t pretend that you don’t see it. Make sure you help him get it back on its feet.
DEU.22.5	 A woman must never wear anything men would wear, and a man must never wear women’s clothes. Whoever does this is disgusting to the L
DEU.22.6	 Whenever you’re traveling and find a nest containing chicks or eggs, this is what you must do. If the mother bird is sitting on the nest, never take her with the chicks. 
DEU.22.7	 You may take the chicks, but make sure you let the mother go. Then things will go well for you, and you will live for a long time.
DEU.22.8	 Whenever you build a new house, put a railing around the edge of the roof. Then you won’t be responsible for a death at your home if someone falls off the roof.
DEU.22.9	 Never plant anything between the rows in your vineyard. Otherwise, you will have to give everything that grows there to the holy place. This includes the crop you planted and the grapes from the vineyard.
DEU.22.10	 Never plow with an ox and a donkey harnessed together.
DEU.22.11	 Never wear clothes made of wool and linen woven together.
DEU.22.12	 Make tassels on the four corners of the shawl you wear over your clothes.
DEU.22.13	 A man might marry a woman, sleep with her, and decide he doesn’t like her. 
DEU.22.14	 Then he might make up charges against her and ruin her reputation by saying, “I married this woman. But when I slept with her, I found out she wasn’t a virgin.” 
DEU.22.15	 The girl’s father and mother must go to the city gate where the leaders of the city are and submit the evidence that their daughter was a virgin. 
DEU.22.16	 The girl’s father will tell the leaders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he doesn’t like her. 
DEU.22.17	 Now he has made up charges against her. He says he found out that my daughter wasn’t a virgin. But here’s the evidence!” Then the girl’s parents must spread out the cloth in front of the leaders of the city. 
DEU.22.18	 The leaders of that city must take the man and punish him. 
DEU.22.19	 They will fine him 2¼ pounds of silver and give it to the girl’s father. The husband ruined the reputation of an Israelite virgin. She will continue to be his wife, and he can never divorce her as long as he lives.
DEU.22.20	 But if the charge is true, and no evidence that the girl was a virgin can be found, 
DEU.22.21	 they must take the girl to the entrance of her father’s house. The men of her city must stone her to death because she has committed such a godless act in Israel: She had sex before marriage, while she was still living in her father’s house. You must get rid of this evil.
DEU.22.22	 If a man is caught having sexual intercourse with a married woman, both that man and the woman must die. You must get rid of this evil in Israel.
DEU.22.23	 This is what you must do when a man has sexual intercourse with a virgin who is engaged to another man. If this happens in a city, 
DEU.22.24	 take them to the gate of the city and stone them to death. The girl must die because she was in a city and didn’t scream for help. The man must die because he had sex with another man’s wife. You must get rid of this evil.
DEU.22.25	 But if a man rapes an engaged girl out in the country, then only the man must die. 
DEU.22.26	 Don’t do anything to the girl. She has not committed a sin for which she deserves to die. This is like the case of someone who attacks and murders another person. 
DEU.22.27	 The man found the girl out in the country. She may have screamed for help, but no one was there to rescue her.
DEU.22.28	 This is what you must do when a man rapes a virgin who isn’t engaged. When the crime is discovered, 
DEU.22.29	 the man who had sexual intercourse with her must give the girl’s father 1¼ pounds of silver, and she will become his wife. Since he raped her, he can never divorce her as long as he lives.
DEU.22.30	 A man must never marry his father’s wife because this would disgrace his father.

DEU.23.9	 When you’re at war and have set up camp to fight your enemies, stay away from anything that will make you unclean.
DEU.23.10	 If one of your men becomes unclean from a nocturnal emission, he must go outside the camp and stay there. 
DEU.23.11	 Toward evening he must wash, and at sunset he may come back to camp.
DEU.23.12	 Choose a place outside the camp where you can go ⌊to relieve yourself⌋. 
DEU.23.13	 You must carry a pointed stick as part of your equipment. When you go outside to squat, dig a hole with it. When you’re done, cover up your excrement.

DEU.23.25	 If you go into your neighbor’s grain field, you may pick grain by hand. But never use a sickle to cut your neighbor’s grain.
DEU.24.1	 This is what you must do if a husband writes out a certificate of divorce, gives it to his wife, and makes her leave his house. (He divorced her because he found out something indecent about her and she no longer pleased him.) 
DEU.24.2	 She might marry another man after she leaves his house. 
DEU.24.3	 If her second husband doesn’t love her and divorces her, or if he dies, 
DEU.24.4	 her first husband is not allowed to marry her again. She has become unclean.
DEU.24.5	 A man who has recently been married will be free from military duty or any other public service. For one year he is free to stay at home and make his new wife happy.
DEU.24.6	 Never let a family’s handmill for grinding flour—or even part of a handmill—be taken to guarantee a loan. The family wouldn’t be able to prepare food in order to stay alive.
DEU.24.7	 Whoever kidnaps another Israelite must die. The kidnapper must die, whether he treated the other person like a slave

DEU.24.12	 If the person is poor, don’t keep the coat you took as a deposit overnight. 
DEU.24.13	 Make sure you bring it back to him at sunset. When he wears his coat to bed ⌊that night⌋, he’ll bless you. You will have done the right thing in the presence of the L

DEU.24.16	 Parents must never be put to death for the crimes of their children, and children must never be put to death for the crimes of their parents. Each person must be put to death for his own crime.

DEU.24.22	 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. So I’m commanding you to do this.
DEU.25.1	 This is what you must do whenever ⌊two⌋ people have a disagreement that is brought into court. The judges will hear the case and decide who’s right and who’s wrong. 
DEU.25.2	 If the person who’s in the wrong deserves to be beaten, the judge will order him to lie down. Then the judge will have him beaten with as many lashes as the crime deserves. 
DEU.25.3	 Forty lashes may be given, but no more. If an Israelite were given more than that, he would be publicly humiliated.
DEU.25.4	 Never muzzle an ox when it’s threshing 
DEU.25.5	 When brothers live together and one of them dies without having a son, his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband’s brother must marry her and sleep with her. He must do his duty as her brother-in-law. 
DEU.25.6	 Then the first son she has will carry the dead brother’s name so that his name won’t die out in Israel.
DEU.25.7	 But if the man doesn’t want to marry his brother’s widow, she must go to the leaders of the city at the city gate. She must say, “My brother-in-law refuses to let his brother’s name continue in Israel. He doesn’t want to do his duty as my brother-in-law.” 
DEU.25.8	 Then the leaders of the city must summon him and talk to him. If he persists in saying that he doesn’t want to marry her, 
DEU.25.9	 his brother’s widow must go up to him in the presence of the leaders. She must take off one of his sandals and spit in his face. She must make this formal statement: “This is what happens to a man who refuses to continue his brother’s family line.” 
DEU.25.10	 Then in Israel his family will be called the Family of the Man Without a Sandal.
DEU.25.11	 This is what you must do when two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from the man who is beating him. If she tries to stop the fight by grabbing the other man’s genitals, 
DEU.25.12	 cut off her hand. Have no pity on her.
DEU.25.13	 Never carry two sets of weights, a heavier one and a lighter one. 
DEU.25.14	 Never have two kinds of measures in your house, a larger one and a smaller one.

DEU.32.13	and olive oil from solid rock.
DEU.32.14	 They ate cheese from cows
DEU.32.14	and drank milk from sheep and goats.
DEU.32.14	He gave them fat from lambs,
DEU.32.14	rams from the stock of Bashan,
DEU.32.14	male goats, and the best wheat.

DEU.32.16	and angered him because they worshiped worthless idols.
DEU.32.17	 They sacrificed to demons that are not God,
DEU.32.17	to gods they never heard of.
DEU.32.17	These were new gods, who came from nearby,
DEU.32.17	gods your ancestors never worshiped.

DEU.32.44	 Moses came with Hoshea,

DEU.32.51	 This is because both of you were unfaithful to me at the oasis of Meribah at Kadesh in the Desert of Zin. You didn’t show the Israelites how holy I am. 
DEU.32.52	 You may see the land from a distance, but you may not enter the land I’m giving the Israelites.”

JOS.2.1	 From Shittim Joshua, son of Nun, secretly sent out two men as spies. He told them, “Go, look at that country, especially the city of Jericho.” So they went to Jericho and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab to spend the night there.
JOS.2.2	 The king of Jericho was told, “Some Israelites have entered the city tonight. They came to gather information about our land.” 
JOS.2.3	 So the king of Jericho sent messengers to Rahab, who told her, “Bring out the men who came to your house. They came here to gather information about the entire land.”
JOS.2.4	 But the woman had already taken the two men inside and hidden them. So she said, “Yes, the men did come here. But I didn’t know where they had come from. 
JOS.2.5	 When it was dark and the gate was just about to close, they left. I don’t know where they went. If you hurry, you’ll catch up with them.” 
JOS.2.6	 (She had taken them up to the roof and covered them with the flax which she had laid up there.)
JOS.2.7	 The king’s men pursued them on the road leading to a shallow place to cross the Jordan River. As soon as the king’s men had left, the gate was closed.
JOS.2.8	 Before the spies fell asleep, Rahab went up to them on the roof. 
JOS.2.9	 She said to them, “I know the L

JOS.2.11	 When we heard about it, we lost heart. There was no courage left in any of us because of you. The L

JOS.2.14	 The men promised her, “We pledge our lives for your lives. If you don’t tell anyone what we’re doing here, we’ll treat you kindly and honestly when the L
JOS.2.15	 So she let them down by a rope from her window since her house was built into the city wall. (She lived in the city wall.) 
JOS.2.16	 She told them, “Go to the mountains so that the men who are pursuing you will not find you. Hide there for three days until they return to Jericho. Then you can go on your way.”
JOS.2.17	 The men told her, “We will be free from the oath which you made us swear, ⌊if you tell anyone what we’re doing here⌋. 
JOS.2.18	 When we invade your land, tie this red cord in the window through which you let us down. Also, gather your father, mother, brothers, and all your father’s family into your house. 
JOS.2.19	 Whoever leaves your house will be responsible for his own life. We will be free from that responsibility. But we will take responsibility if anyone inside your house is harmed. 
JOS.2.20	 If you tell anyone what we’re doing here, we will be free from the oath which you made us swear.”
JOS.2.21	 “I agree,” she said. So she let them go and tied the red cord in the window.
JOS.2.22	 The men went to the mountains and stayed there for three days until the king’s men returned to Jericho. The king’s men had searched for them all along the road but had not found them. 
JOS.2.23	 Then the two spies came down out of the mountains, crossed the Jordan River, and returned to Joshua, son of Nun. They told him everything that had happened to them. 
JOS.2.24	 They told Joshua, “The L

JOS.4.4	 Joshua called the 12 men whom he had selected (one from each tribe). 
JOS.4.5	 He said to them, “Go to the middle of the Jordan River in front of the ark of the L

JOS.4.11	 As soon as everyone had crossed, the priests with the L
JOS.4.12	 The men of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh did as Moses had told them. They marched across in battle formation ahead of the people of Israel.

JOS.4.15	 The L
JOS.4.16	 “Order the priests who carry the ark of the testimony to come out of the Jordan River.”

JOS.4.19	 On the tenth day of the first month, the people came out of the Jordan River. They made their camp at Gilgal, just east of Jericho. 
JOS.4.20	 At Gilgal Joshua set up the 12 stones they had taken from the Jordan. 
JOS.4.21	 He said to the people of Israel, “In the future when children ask their parents, ‘What do these stones mean?’ 
JOS.4.22	 the children should be told that Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry ground. 
JOS.4.23	 The L

JOS.5.1	 All the Amorite kings west of the Jordan River and all the Canaanite kings along the Mediterranean Sea heard that the L

JOS.5.3	 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the men of Israel at the Hill of Circumcision.
JOS.5.4	 This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: All the soldiers had died on the way through the desert after they left Egypt. 
JOS.5.5	 The men who left Egypt had been circumcised. However, the men born later, on the way through the desert, were not circumcised. 
JOS.5.6	 For 40 years the Israelites wandered through the desert until all their soldiers who left Egypt died. They died because they disobeyed the L
JOS.5.7	 The sons who took their place had not been circumcised on the way. So Joshua circumcised them. 
JOS.5.8	 When all the men had been circumcised, they remained in the camp until they recovered.
JOS.5.9	 The L
JOS.5.10	 The people of Israel camped at Gilgal in the Jericho plain. There they celebrated the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month. 
JOS.5.11	 On the day after the Passover, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened bread and roasted grain. 
JOS.5.12	 The day after that, the manna stopped. The people of Israel never had manna again. That year they began to eat the crops that grew in Canaan.
JOS.5.13	 When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, “Are you one of us or one of our enemies?” 
JOS.5.14	 He answered, “Neither one! I am here as the commander of the L
JOS.5.15	 The commander of the L
JOS.6.1	 Jericho was bolted and barred shut because the people were afraid of the Israelites. No one could enter or leave.

JOS.6.3	 All the soldiers will march around the city once a day for six days. 
JOS.6.4	 Seven priests will carry rams’ horns ahead of the ark. But on the seventh day you must march around the city seven times while the priests blow their horns. 
JOS.6.5	 When you hear a long blast on the horn, all the troops must shout very loudly. The wall around the city will collapse. Then the troops must charge straight ahead into the city.”
JOS.6.6	 Joshua, son of Nun, summoned the priests. He said to them, “Pick up the ark of the promise, and have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns ahead of the L
JOS.6.7	 He told the troops, “March around the city. Let the armed men march ahead of the L
JOS.6.8	 After Joshua had given orders to the troops, the seven priests carrying the seven rams’ horns ahead of the L
JOS.6.9	 The armed men went ahead of the priests, who blew their horns. The rear guard followed the ark while the priests continued to blow their horns.
JOS.6.10	 Joshua ordered the troops, “Don’t shout, make any noise, or let one word come out of your mouth until I tell you to shout. Then shout!” 
JOS.6.11	 So the L
JOS.6.12	 Joshua got up early in the morning. The priests carried the L
JOS.6.13	 The seven priests carrying the seven rams’ horns were ahead of it. The priests blew their horns as they went. The armed men were ahead of them, and the rear guard followed the L
JOS.6.14	 They went around the city once on the second day and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
JOS.6.15	 On the seventh day they got up at dawn. They marched around the city seven times the same way they had done it before. That was the only day they marched around it seven times. 
JOS.6.16	 When they went around the seventh time, the priests blew their rams’ horns.
JOS.6.16	Joshua said to the troops, “Shout, because the L
JOS.6.17	 The city has been claimed by the L
JOS.6.18	 But stay away from what has been claimed by the L
JOS.6.19	 All the silver and gold and everything made of bronze and iron are holy and belong to the L
JOS.6.20	 So the troops shouted very loudly when they heard the blast of the rams’ horns, and the wall collapsed. The troops charged straight ahead and captured the city. 
JOS.6.21	 They claimed everything in it for the L
JOS.6.22	 But Joshua said to the two spies, “Go to the prostitute’s house. Bring the woman out, along with everything she has, as you swore you would do for her.”
JOS.6.23	 The spies went and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, everything she had, and even all of her relatives. They gave them a place outside the camp of Israel. 
JOS.6.24	 Then Israel burned the city and everything in it. But they put the silver and gold and everything made of bronze and iron into the L
JOS.6.25	 Joshua spared the prostitute Rahab, her father’s family, and everything she had. She still lives in Israel today because she hid the messengers Joshua had sent to look at Jericho.
JOS.6.26	 At that time Joshua pronounced this curse:
JOS.6.26	“The L
JOS.6.26	whoever comes to rebuild the city of Jericho.
JOS.6.26	It will cost him his firstborn son
JOS.6.26	to lay the foundation.
JOS.6.26	It will cost him his youngest son
JOS.6.26	to set up the city doors.”
JOS.6.27	 So the L
JOS.7.1	 The people of Israel proved to be disloyal about the things claimed by the L
JOS.7.2	 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai. Ai is near Beth Aven, east of Bethel. He said to them, “Go, look at that country.” So the men went and looked at Ai.
JOS.7.3	 They came back to Joshua and told him, “You don’t need to send all the troops. Only about two or three thousand men are needed to destroy Ai. Don’t tire the troops out by sending all of them. There are only a few troops in Ai.”
JOS.7.4	 So about three thousand men were sent. However, they fled from the men of Ai. 
JOS.7.5	 The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, chasing them from the city gate to the slope of the stone quarries. Israel’s troops lost heart and were scared stiff.
JOS.7.6	 Joshua and the leaders of Israel tore their clothes in grief. They put dust on their heads and bowed down to the ground in front of the L
JOS.7.7	 Joshua said, “Almighty L
JOS.7.8	 Lord, what else can I say after Israel ran away from its enemy? 
JOS.7.9	 When the Canaanites and everyone who lives in the land hears about it, they will surround us and remove every memory of us from the earth. What will you do then so that your great name ⌊will be remembered⌋?”
JOS.7.10	 The L
JOS.7.11	 Israel has sinned. They have ignored the requirements 
JOS.7.12	 “The people of Israel will not be able to defend themselves against their enemies. They will run away from their enemies because the people of Israel are now claimed for destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy what I have claimed for myself.
JOS.7.13	 “Get up! Tell the people, ‘Get ready for tomorrow by performing the ceremonies to make yourselves holy. This is what the L

JOS.7.15	 The man who is selected, along with everything he has, must be burned because he has ⌊stolen⌋ what the L
JOS.7.16	 Joshua got up early in the morning. He had Israel come forward by tribes. The tribe of Judah was selected. 
JOS.7.17	 Then he had the families of Judah come forward, and the family of Zerah was selected. Then he had the family of Zerah come forward man by man, and Zabdi was selected. 
JOS.7.18	 Then he had Zabdi’s household come forward man by man, and Achan was selected. Achan from the tribe of Judah was the son of Carmi, grandson of Zabdi, and great-grandson of Zerah.
JOS.7.19	 Joshua said to Achan, “Son, give honor and praise to the L
JOS.7.20	 Then Achan answered Joshua, “It’s true. I have sinned against the L
JOS.7.21	 I saw a fine robe from Babylonia, five pounds of silver, and a bar of gold weighing about one pound among the loot. I wanted them, so I took them. You will find them buried inside my tent with the silver beneath them.”
JOS.7.22	 Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. The loot was buried inside with the silver beneath it. 
JOS.7.23	 They took the loot from the tent and brought it to Joshua and all the people of Israel. Then they laid it out in the presence of the L
JOS.7.24	 Joshua and all Israel took Achan (son of Zerah), the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, and his tent—everything he had—and brought them to the valley of Achor [Disaster].
JOS.7.25	 Then Joshua said, “Why did you bring this disaster on us? The L
JOS.7.26	 They made such a large pile of stones over Achan that it is still there today. Then the L
JOS.8.1	 The L
JOS.8.2	 You will do the same thing to Ai and its king that you did to Jericho and its king. However, you may take its loot and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.”
JOS.8.3	 So Joshua and all the soldiers started to march against Ai. Joshua picked 30,000 of his best soldiers and sent them out at night 
JOS.8.4	 with these orders: “Set an ambush behind the city. Don’t go very far away from the city. Everyone must be ready. 
JOS.8.5	 I’ll approach the city with the rest of the troops. When they come out to attack us as they did the first time, we will run away from them. 
JOS.8.6	 They’ll come out after us, and we will lure them away from the city. They’ll say, ‘They’re running away from us just like the first time.’ As we run away from them, 
JOS.8.7	 you come out of hiding and capture the city. The L
JOS.8.8	 When you have captured the city, set it on fire. Do what the L
JOS.8.9	 So Joshua sent them out, and they hid. They took their position west of Ai, between Bethel and Ai. Joshua spent the night with the troops.
JOS.8.10	 Joshua got up early in the morning and assembled the troops. Then he and the leaders of Israel led the army to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	 All the troops with him marched until they were near the city. They camped north of Ai with the ravine between them and Ai.
JOS.8.12	 Joshua had taken about five thousand men and had them hide between Bethel and Ai, west of the city. 
JOS.8.13	 All the troops were positioned. The main camp was north of the city, and the other troops were hiding west of the city. That night Joshua went down into the middle of the valley.
JOS.8.14	 When the king of Ai saw the main camp, he and all his troops got up early in the morning. They rushed out toward the plains to meet Israel for battle, just where ⌊Joshua⌋ expected. However, the king didn’t know there were troops behind the city waiting to attack him.
JOS.8.15	 Joshua and all Israel pretended to be defeated. They ran away toward the desert. 
JOS.8.16	 All the troops in the city were called out to chase them. As they chased Joshua, they were lured away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	 Not one man was left in Ai or Bethel; they all went after Israel. So the city was left unprotected as they chased Israel.
JOS.8.18	 Then the L
JOS.8.19	 The men who were hiding got up as soon as he stretched out his hand. They entered the city, captured it, and quickly set it on fire. 
JOS.8.20	 When the men of Ai looked back, they could see the city going up in smoke. They had no place to go, since the Israelites, who had been running toward the desert, had now turned back on them. 
JOS.8.21	 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men who had been hiding had captured the city and that it was going up in smoke, they turned and attacked the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	 The men who had captured the city also came out and attacked them. The men of Ai were caught between the battle lines of Israel. So Israel attacked them on both sides. None of them survived or escaped. 
JOS.8.23	 But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	 Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the fields and in the desert where they had been pursued. They put them all to death; not one person survived. Then the Israelites went back to Ai and killed everyone left there. 
JOS.8.25	 Twelve thousand men and women from Ai died that day. 
JOS.8.26	 Joshua did not lower his hand holding the spear until he had completely destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
JOS.8.27	 Israel took the loot and the livestock of that city for themselves, as the L
JOS.8.28	 So Joshua burned Ai and made it a deserted mound of ruins.
JOS.8.29	 Joshua hung the king of Ai’s ⌊dead body⌋ on a pole and left him there until evening. When the sun went down, Joshua gave the order to take his body down. They threw it in the entrance of the city and made a large pile of stones over it. That pile is still there today.
JOS.8.30	 At that time Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal to the L
JOS.8.31	 He built an altar with uncut stones on which no iron chisels had been used. This was as the L
JOS.8.32	 There in front of the people of Israel he wrote on stone slabs a copy of the Teachings which Moses had written down.
JOS.8.33	 All the people of Israel, whether foreigners or native Israelites, the leaders, officers, and judges were standing on opposite sides of the ark. They faced the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the L
JOS.8.34	 Afterwards, Joshua read all the Teachings—the blessings and curses—as they had all been written down by Moses. 
JOS.8.35	 Joshua read ⌊Moses’ Teachings⌋ in front of the whole assembly of Israel, including women, children, and foreigners living among them. He did not leave out one word from everything Moses had commanded.
JOS.9.1	 When all the kings west of the Jordan River heard about these events, 
JOS.9.2	 they joined together to fight Joshua and Israel. (They were the kings in the mountains, the foothills, and along the whole Mediterranean coast as far as Lebanon, the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.) 
JOS.9.3	 When the people living in Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
JOS.9.4	 they devised a scheme. They posed as messengers. They took worn-out sacks on their donkeys. Their wineskins were old, split, and patched. 
JOS.9.5	 Their sandals were worn-out and repaired, and their clothes were tattered. All their bread was dried out and crumbling. 
JOS.9.6	 They came to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal. They told Joshua and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant country. Make a treaty with us right now.”
JOS.9.7	 The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “What if you’re living in this area? We wouldn’t be able to make a treaty with you.”
JOS.9.8	 They responded to Joshua, “We’re at your mercy.”
JOS.9.8	Joshua asked them, “Who are you, and where did you come from?”
JOS.9.9	 They answered him, “We came from a country very far away because the L
JOS.9.10	 We also heard everything he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan in Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	 Our leaders and everyone who lives in our country told us, ‘Take what you need for the trip, and go meet them. Tell them, “We’re at your mercy. Make a treaty with us right now.”’ 
JOS.9.12	 Our bread was warm when we left home to meet with you. Look at it now! It’s dry and crumbling. 
JOS.9.13	 These were new wineskins when we filled them. Look at them now! See how they are splitting! Our clothes and sandals are also worn-out because we have come such a long way.”
JOS.9.14	 The men believed the evidence they were shown, but they did not ask the L
JOS.9.15	 So Joshua made peace with them by making a treaty which allowed them to live. The leaders of the congregation swore to it with an oath.
JOS.9.16	 But three days after the treaty was made, the Israelites heard that these people were their neighbors and lived with them. 
JOS.9.17	 The Israelites broke camp. They came to the cities of Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim two days later. 
JOS.9.18	 The Israelites didn’t destroy these other people, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath about them to the L
JOS.9.19	 But all the leaders said to them, “We have sworn an oath about them to the L
JOS.9.20	 We must let them live to avoid ⌊the L
JOS.9.21	 The leaders said that they should be allowed to live. So they became woodcutters and water carriers for the whole congregation, as the leaders had said.
JOS.9.22	 Joshua sent for the people of Gibeon and asked, “Why did you deceive us by saying, ‘We live very far away from you,’ when you live here with us? 
JOS.9.23	 You are under a curse now. You will always be servants. You will be woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
JOS.9.24	 They answered Joshua, “We were told that the L
JOS.9.25	 Now we’re at your mercy. Do to us what you think is good and right.”
JOS.9.26	 So Joshua rescued them and did not let the people of Israel kill them. 
JOS.9.27	 But that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation. They served the L
JOS.10.1	 King Adoni Zedek of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and claimed it for the L
JOS.10.2	 He and his people were terribly afraid because Gibeon was a large city. It was like one of the royal cities, larger than Ai. All its men were warriors. 
JOS.10.3	 So King Adoni Zedek of Jerusalem sent ⌊this message⌋ to King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon: 
JOS.10.4	 “Come, help me destroy Gibeon because it has made peace with Joshua and the people of Israel.” 
JOS.10.5	 So the five Amorite kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon combined their armies. They marched to Gibeon, camped there, and attacked it.
JOS.10.6	 The men of Gibeon sent this message to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal: “Don’t abandon us! Come quickly, and save us. Help us because all the Amorite kings who live in the mountains have united against us.”
JOS.10.7	 So Joshua, with all his soldiers and best warriors, set out from Gilgal.

JOS.10.16	 The five kings ran away and hid in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	 Someone told Joshua, “The five kings have been found. They are hiding in the cave at Makkedah.”
JOS.10.18	 Joshua replied, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and post a guard there.

JOS.10.20	 Joshua and the Israelites defeated them decisively, almost destroying them. But some who survived got back into the fortified cities. 
JOS.10.21	 Then the whole army returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. Not a single person dared to speak against any of the Israelites.
JOS.10.22	 Joshua said, “Open the cave, and bring me the five kings!” 
JOS.10.23	 So they brought him the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.
JOS.10.24	 When they brought them to Joshua, he called for all the men of Israel. He told the officers who had gone with him, “Come forward and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So that’s what they did. 
JOS.10.25	 Joshua told them, “Don’t be afraid or terrified! Be strong and courageous, because this is what the L
JOS.10.26	 After this, Joshua put them to death and hung their bodies on five poles until evening. 
JOS.10.27	 When the sun went down, Joshua gave the order to take them down from the poles. Then they threw them into the cave where they had been hiding and put large stones over the mouth of the cave. These stones are still there today.

JOS.11.1	 King Jabin of Hazor heard ⌊what had happened⌋. So he sent messengers to King Jobab of Madon and to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph. 
JOS.11.2	 He also sent messengers to the northern kings in the mountains, the plains south of Chinneroth, the foothills, and Naphoth Dor in the west,

JOS.11.15	 So Joshua carried out what the L
JOS.11.16	 Joshua took all this land, the mountains, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the foothills, the plains, and the mountains and foothills of Israel. 
JOS.11.17	 The land extended from Mount Halak which ascends to Seir as far as Baal Gad in the Lebanon Valley at the foot of Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and killed them. 
JOS.11.18	 Joshua waged war with all these kings for a long time.

JOS.12.3	 It included the eastern plains from the Sea of Galilee to the Sea of the Plains (the Dead Sea) and the road that goes south from Beth Jeshimoth to the foot of the slopes of Pisgah.
JOS.12.4	 The territory of King Og of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei was captured. He was the last of the Rephaim.

JOS.12.24	The total was 31 kings.
JOS.13.1	 Joshua was old, near the end of his life. So the L
JOS.13.2	 The land that is left includes all the districts that belong to the Philistines and Geshur. 
JOS.13.3	 It extends from the Shihor River, east of Egypt, northward as far as the border of Ekron. This is considered to be Canaanite territory, even though there are five Philistine rulers over Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, as well as the Avvim people 
JOS.13.4	 in the south. This territory includes all the land of the Canaanites as well as Mearah which belongs to Sidon as far as Aphek, the Amorite border. 
JOS.13.5	 It also includes the land of the people of Gebal, all Lebanon eastward from Baal Gad at the foot of Mount Hermon to the border of Hamath. 
JOS.13.6	 I will force out of the way of the people of Israel everyone who lives in the mountains from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim and all the people of Sidon. However, you must distribute the land as an inheritance to Israel by drawing lots, as I commanded you. 
JOS.13.7	 So divide this land. It will be an inheritance for the nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh.”
JOS.13.8	 The tribes of Reuben and Gad with half of the tribe of Manasseh had received their inheritance east of the Jordan River, since the L
JOS.13.9	 The border extended from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley, including the city in the middle of the valley, and the whole plateau from Medeba to Dibon. 
JOS.13.10	 It included all the cities of King Sihon of the Amorites up to the border of Ammon. Sihon’s capital was Heshbon. 
JOS.13.11	 It also included Gilead, the territory of the people of Geshur and Maacath, all of Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan as far as Salecah 
JOS.13.12	 (the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan). Og ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei. He was the last of the Rephaim. Moses had defeated them and forced them out. 
JOS.13.13	 But the Israelites did not force out the people of Geshur and Maacath. So they still live in Israel today.
JOS.13.14	 Moses did not give any land as an inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The sacrifices offered to the L
JOS.13.15	 Moses gave some land as an inheritance to the tribe of Reuben for their families. 
JOS.13.16	 Their territory extended from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley, including the city in the middle of the valley and the whole plateau near Medeba. 
JOS.13.17	 It included Heshbon and all its cities on the plateau, Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon, 
JOS.13.18	 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the mountain in the valley, 
JOS.13.20	 Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth. 
JOS.13.21	 It also included all the cities of the plateau, the whole kingdom of King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon. Moses defeated him and Midian’s leaders—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They were princes of Sihon, who lived in that country. 
JOS.13.22	 Along with these leaders, the people of Israel also killed Balaam, son of Beor, who used black magic. 
JOS.13.23	 The border of Reuben’s territory was the Jordan River. This was Reuben’s inheritance for its families. It included cities with their villages.
JOS.13.24	 Moses gave some land as an inheritance to the tribe of Gad for its families. 
JOS.13.25	 Their territory included Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half of Ammon as far as Aroer, which is by Rabbah. 
JOS.13.26	 It extended from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Lidbir. 
JOS.13.27	 In the Jordan Valley it included Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon. The Jordan River served as its western border, extending to the end of the Sea of Galilee. 
JOS.13.28	 This was Gad’s inheritance for its families. It included cities with their villages.
JOS.13.29	 Moses gave some land as an inheritance to half of the tribe of Manasseh. It was only for the families of that half of the tribe. 
JOS.13.30	 Their territory extended from Mahanaim and included all of Bashan (the whole kingdom of King Og of Bashan) and all 60 settlements of Jair that were in Bashan. 
JOS.13.31	 It also included half of Gilead with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the royal cities of Og in Bashan. They were given to half the families of Machir, son of Manasseh, ⌊for their inheritance⌋.
JOS.13.32	 This is the land that Moses distributed on Moab’s plains, east of the Jordan River near Jericho. 
JOS.13.33	 Moses did not give any land as an inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The L

JOS.14.3	 Moses had given the two-and-a-half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan River. He did not give any land as an inheritance to Levi’s tribe, 
JOS.14.4	 because Joseph’s descendants, Manasseh and Ephraim, formed two tribes. The Levites were not given a share of the land. Joseph’s descendants gave the Levites cities to live in with pasturelands for their cattle and everything they had. 
JOS.14.5	 So the people of Israel divided the land as the L

JOS.14.13	 So Joshua blessed Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and gave him Hebron as his inheritance. 
JOS.14.14	 Hebron is still the inheritance of Caleb, son of Jephunneh and grandson of Kenaz, because Caleb was completely loyal to the L
JOS.14.15	 In the past Hebron was called Kiriath Arba. Arba was the greatest man among the people of Anak. So the land had peace.
JOS.15.1	 The lot was drawn for the families of the tribe of Judah. Their territory extends as far south as the territory of Edom and the desert of Zin. 
JOS.15.2	 The southern border starts from the south end of the Dead Sea 
JOS.15.3	 and goes south of the Akrabbim Pass. It then passes Zin and goes up south of Kadesh Barnea. From there it goes to Hezron, up to Addar, around to Karka, 
JOS.15.4	 and on to Azmon. It comes out at the River of Egypt so that the border ends at the Mediterranean Sea. This is the southern border.
JOS.15.5	 The eastern border is the Dead Sea as far north as the mouth of the Jordan River.
JOS.15.5	The northern border starts from the north end of the Dead Sea at the mouth of the Jordan 
JOS.15.6	 and goes up to Beth Hoglah. It then passes north to Beth Arabah and goes up to the Rock of Bohan, son of Reuben. 
JOS.15.7	 From the valley of Achor, the border goes up to Debir and turns north to the region that faces the Adummim Pass, south of the valley. Then the border passes the Springs of En Shemesh and ends at En Rogel. 
JOS.15.8	 It continues up the valley of Ben Hinnom to the south slope of the Jebusite city Jerusalem. It then goes to the top of the mountain that overlooks the valley of Hinnom to the west at the north end of the valley of Rephaim. 
JOS.15.9	 From the top of that mountain the border goes around to the spring of Nephtoah. From there it goes to the cities of Mount Ephron and around to Baalah (now called Kiriath Jearim). 
JOS.15.10	 From Baalah the border turns west to Mount Seir and over to the north slope of Mount Jearim (now called Chesalon). Then it goes down to Beth Shemesh and on to Timnah. 
JOS.15.11	 From there the border goes on the north side of Ekron and turns to Shikkeron, on to Mount Baalah, and comes out at Jabneel. The border ends at the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.12	 The western border is the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. These are the borders around Judah that belong to their families.
JOS.15.13	 Joshua gave Caleb, son of Jephunneh, a share of land among the people of Judah as the L
JOS.15.14	 Caleb forced out Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, three descendants of Anak from Hebron. 
JOS.15.15	 From there he marched against the people living in Debir. (In the past Debir was called Kiriath Sepher.)
JOS.15.16	 Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Achsah as a wife to anyone who attacks Kiriath Sepher and captures it.” 
JOS.15.17	 Then Othniel, son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz, captured it. So Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. 
JOS.15.18	 When she came to Othniel, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want?”
JOS.15.19	 She answered, “Give me a blessing. Since you’ve given me some dry land, also give me some springs.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
JOS.15.20	 This is the land inherited by the families of the tribe of Judah.
JOS.15.21	 On the farthest edge of the Negev, on the border of Edom, they gave the tribe of Judah 29 cities with their villages: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 
JOS.15.22	 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 
JOS.15.23	 Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, 
JOS.15.24	 Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, 
JOS.15.25	 Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (now called Hazor), 
JOS.15.26	 Amam, Shema, Moladah, 
JOS.15.27	 Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth Pelet, 
JOS.15.28	 Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah, 
JOS.15.29	 Baalah, Iim, Ezem, 
JOS.15.30	 Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah, 
JOS.15.31	 Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 
JOS.15.32	 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon.
JOS.15.33	 In the foothills they gave Judah 14 cities with their villages: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, 
JOS.15.34	 Zanoah, En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam, 
JOS.15.35	 Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah, 
JOS.15.36	 Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim.
JOS.15.37	 They also gave Judah 16 other cities with their villages: Zenan, Hadashah, Migdalgad, 
JOS.15.38	 Dilean, Mizpah, Joktheel, 
JOS.15.39	 Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, 
JOS.15.40	 Cabbon, Lahmas, Chitlish, 
JOS.15.41	 Gederoth, Beth Dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah.
JOS.15.42	 An additional nine cities with their villages were given to Judah: Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 
JOS.15.43	 Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 
JOS.15.44	 Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah.
JOS.15.45	 Judah also received Ekron with its cities and villages. 
JOS.15.46	 This included all the cities with their villages between Ekron and the Mediterranean Sea and alongside Ashdod. 
JOS.15.47	 Added to this were Ashdod and Gaza with their cities and villages as far as the River of Egypt and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.48	 In the mountains they gave Judah 11 cities with their villages: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, 
JOS.15.49	 Dannah, Kiriath Sannah (now called Debir), 
JOS.15.50	 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, 
JOS.15.51	 Goshen, Holon, and Giloh.
JOS.15.52	 They also gave Judah nine other cities with their villages: Arab, Dumah, Eshan, 
JOS.15.53	 Janim, Beth Tappuah, Aphekah, 
JOS.15.54	 Humtah, Kiriath Arba (now called Hebron), and Zior.
JOS.15.55	 They also received another ten cities with their villages: Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, 
JOS.15.56	 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 
JOS.15.57	 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah.
JOS.15.58	 Halhul, Bethzur, Gedor, 
JOS.15.59	 Maarath, Bethanoth, and Eltekon were six other cities with their villages that were given to Judah.
JOS.15.60	 The two cities of Kiriath Baal (now called Kiriath Jearim) and Rabbah with their villages ⌊were given to Judah⌋.
JOS.15.61	 In the desert Judah was given six cities with their villages: Beth Arabah, Middin, Secacah, 
JOS.15.62	 Nibshan, Ir Hamelah, and En Gedi.
JOS.15.63	 However, Judah was not able to force out the people of Jebus who lived in Jerusalem. So they still live with Judah in Jerusalem today.
JOS.16.1	 The lot was drawn for Joseph. The border of Joseph’s territory goes from the Jordan River at Jericho to the springs of Jericho on the east, through the desert that goes up from Jericho, and through the mountains to Bethel. 
JOS.16.2	 From Bethel the border goes to Luz and over to Ataroth at the border of the Archites. 
JOS.16.3	 Then it descends west to the border of Japhlet and Lower Beth Horon, on to Gezer, and ends at the Mediterranean Sea. 
JOS.16.4	 So Joseph’s sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, received this land as their inheritance.
JOS.16.5	 This is the territory for the families descended from Ephraim. The eastern border of the land they inherited is from Ataroth Addar to Upper Beth Horon. 
JOS.16.6	 From there the border goes west, with Michmethath on the north. The border then turns east to Taanath Shiloh and passes east to Janoah. 
JOS.16.7	 From Janoah it descends to Ataroth and Naarah, touches Jericho, and ends at the Jordan River. 
JOS.16.8	 At Tappuah the border goes west along the Kanah River and ends at the Mediterranean Sea. This is the land given as an inheritance to the families of the tribe of Ephraim 
JOS.16.9	 with all the cities and their villages selected for Ephraim in Manasseh’s territory. 
JOS.16.10	 However, they did not force out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer. So the Canaanites still live in Ephraim today, but they are required to do forced labor.
JOS.17.1	 The lot was drawn for the tribe of Manasseh, because Manasseh was Joseph’s firstborn. Machir, Manasseh’s firstborn, the ancestor of the people living in Gilead, had received Gilead and Bashan because he was a soldier. 
JOS.17.2	 The land was given to the rest of the families descended from Manasseh, to the descendants of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Joseph’s son Manasseh listed by their families.
JOS.17.3	 Zelophehad, son of Hepher, grandson of Gilead, and great-grandson of Machir, whose father was Manasseh, had no sons—only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
JOS.17.4	 They came to the priest Eleazar, Joshua (son of Nun), and the leaders. They said, “The L
JOS.17.5	 Ten portions of land went to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan River. 
JOS.17.6	 These portions were distributed because Manasseh’s daughters were given an inheritance along with his sons, while Gilead belonged to Manasseh’s other descendants.
JOS.17.7	 Manasseh’s border extends from Asher to Michmethath, which faces Shechem. Then the border goes south toward the people who live in En Tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	 (The land of Tappuah belongs to Manasseh, but Tappuah itself, on the border of Manasseh, belongs to Ephraim.) 
JOS.17.9	 The border then descends southward to the Kanah River. These cities belong to Ephraim, although they are among Manasseh’s cities. Manasseh’s ⌊southern⌋ border is the river, which ends at the Mediterranean Sea. 
JOS.17.10	 What is south ⌊of the river⌋ belongs to Ephraim, and what is north ⌊of it⌋ belongs to Manasseh. So the Mediterranean Sea ⌊is its western border⌋, Asher its northern border, and Issachar its eastern border. 
JOS.17.11	 In Issachar and Asher, Manasseh possessed Beth Shean and Ibleam with their villages and the people living in Dor, En Dor, Taanach, and Megiddo and their villages. The last three are on mountain ridges.
JOS.17.12	 But Manasseh was not able to take possession of these cities since the Canaanites were determined to stay in this land. 
JOS.17.13	 When the Israelites became strong enough, they made the Canaanites do forced labor, since they didn’t force all of them out.
JOS.17.14	 Joseph’s descendants asked Joshua, “Why did you give us only one region for an inheritance? We have a lot of people because the L
JOS.17.15	 Joshua replied, “If there are so many of you, go into the forest! Clear ground for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaim if the mountains of Ephraim are too confining for you.”
JOS.17.16	 Joseph’s descendants responded, “The mountains are not enough for us either. Besides, all the Canaanites living in the valley, in Beth Shean and its villages, and in the valley of Jezreel have chariots made of iron.”
JOS.17.17	 Then Joshua said to the descendants of Joseph, ⌊the tribes of⌋ Ephraim and Manasseh, “You are an important and very powerful people. One region is really not enough for you. 
JOS.17.18	 The mountain region will be yours as well. It is a forest, so you will have to clear it. All of it will be yours. But you must force out the Canaanites, even though they are strong and have chariots made of iron.”
JOS.18.1	 The whole congregation of Israel gathered at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The land was under their control.
JOS.18.2	 There were still seven tribes in Israel who had not yet received any land as their inheritance. 
JOS.18.3	 So Joshua asked the Israelites, “How long are you going to waste time conquering the land which the L
JOS.18.4	 Choose three men from each tribe, and I will send them out. They will survey the land and write a description of it which shows ⌊the borders of⌋ their inheritance. Then they will come back to me. 
JOS.18.5	 They will divide the land into seven parts. Judah will stay within its territory in the south, and Joseph’s descendants will stay within their territory in the north. 
JOS.18.6	 You must describe the seven parts of the land and report to me here. I will draw lots for you here in the presence of the L
JOS.18.7	 Levi’s tribe has no separate region among you, because their inheritance is to serve the L
JOS.18.8	 As the men got ready to go, Joshua ordered them to write a description of the land. He said, “Go survey the land. Write a description of it, and return to me. Then I will draw lots for you in the presence of the L
JOS.18.9	 The men surveyed the land. They described it in a book. The land was divided into seven parts according to its cities. Then they returned to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	 So Joshua drew lots for them in the presence of the L
JOS.18.11	 The lot was drawn for the families of the tribe of Benjamin. Their territory lies between Judah’s and Joseph’s. 
JOS.18.12	 Their northern border starts at the Jordan, goes up the slope north of Jericho, west through the mountains, and ends at the desert of Beth Aven. 
JOS.18.13	 From there the border goes to the south slope of Luz (now called Bethel). Then the border goes down to Ataroth Addar over the mountains south of Lower Beth Horon. 
JOS.18.14	 The border turns and goes around on the west side, south of the mountain that faces Beth Horon, and ends at Kiriath Baal (now called Kiriath Jearim), a city of Judah. 
JOS.18.15	 The southern border begins just outside Kiriath Jearim and goes west, to the springs of Nephtoah. 
JOS.18.16	 Then the border descends to the foot of the mountain that overlooks the valley of Ben Hinnom, in the north end of the valley of Rephaim. It descends to the valley of Hinnom, to the south slope of the city of Jebus, and down to En Rogel. 
JOS.18.17	 Then it turns north and goes to En Shemesh and from there to the region opposite the Adummim Pass. It descends to the Rock of Bohan, son of Reuben. 
JOS.18.18	 Then it continues on to the north side of the slope facing the plains and down into the plains. 
JOS.18.19	 The border continues to the north slope of Beth Hoglah and ends at the northern bay of the Dead Sea at the south end of the Jordan River. This is its southern border. 
JOS.18.20	 The Jordan River is its eastern border. These are the borders surrounding the inheritance given to Benjamin for its families.
JOS.18.21	 These are the 12 cities with their villages that belong to the tribe of Benjamin for its families: Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, 
JOS.18.22	 Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
JOS.18.23	 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
JOS.18.24	 Chephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba. 
JOS.18.25	 There were 14 other cities with their villages: Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 
JOS.18.26	 Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, 
JOS.18.27	 Rekem, Ir Peel, Taralah, 
JOS.18.28	 Zela, Eleph, Jebus (now called Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kiriath. This is Benjamin’s inheritance for its families.
JOS.19.1	 The second lot was drawn for the families of the tribe of Simeon. Their inheritance was within Judah. 
JOS.19.2	 In their inheritance they received 13 cities and their villages: Beersheba (Sheba), Moladah, 
JOS.19.3	 Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem, 
JOS.19.4	 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
JOS.19.5	 Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah, 
JOS.19.6	 Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen. 
JOS.19.7	 There were four other cities with their villages: Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan. 
JOS.19.8	 All the villages around these cities as far as Baalath Beer and Ramath Negev were also included. This is the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon for its families. 
JOS.19.9	 Simeon’s inheritance was a part of Judah’s because Judah had more land than it needed. So Simeon received its inheritance inside Judah’s borders.
JOS.19.10	 The third lot was drawn for the families descended from Zebulun. The border of their inheritance goes as far as Sarid. 
JOS.19.11	 Toward the west the border ascends to Maralah and touches Dabbesheth and the river near Jokneam. 
JOS.19.12	 But from Sarid it turns directly east toward the border of Chisloth Tabor, on to Daberath, and then ascends toward Japhia. 
JOS.19.13	 From there it goes directly east to Gath Hepher, Eth Kazin, and Rimmon, where it turns to Neah. 
JOS.19.14	 There the border turns north to Hannathon and ends at the valley of Iphtah El. 
JOS.19.15	 This also includes Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem. There were 12 cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.16	 These cities with their villages are the inheritance given to the families descended from Zebulun.
JOS.19.17	 The fourth lot was drawn for the families descended from Issachar. 
JOS.19.18	 Their territory included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 
JOS.19.19	 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 
JOS.19.20	 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 
JOS.19.21	 Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez. 
JOS.19.22	 The border touches Tabor, Shahazimah, and Beth Shemesh and ends at the Jordan River. There were 16 cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.23	 These cities with their villages are the inheritance for the families of the tribe of Issachar.
JOS.19.24	 The fifth lot was drawn for the families of the tribe of Asher. 
JOS.19.25	 Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 
JOS.19.26	 Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. The border touches Carmel and Shihor Libnath in the west. 
JOS.19.27	 Then it turns east to Beth Dagon and touches Zebulun and the valley of Iphtah El in the north and goes to Beth Emek and Neiel. From there it goes northward to Cabul, 
JOS.19.28	 Abdon,
JOS.19.29	 Then it turns at Ramah and goes on to the fortified city of Tyre. The border then turns to Hosah and ends at the Mediterranean Sea. The territory includes Meheleb, Achzib, 
JOS.19.30	 Umma, Acco, Aphek, and Rehob. There were 22 cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.31	 These cities with their villages are the inheritance for the families of the tribe of Asher.
JOS.19.32	 The sixth lot was drawn for the families descended from the tribe of Naphtali. 
JOS.19.33	 Their border starts from Heleph at the oak tree at Zaanannim. It continues to Adami Nekeb, Jabneel, to Lakkum, and ends at the Jordan River. 
JOS.19.34	 The border turns west to Aznoth Tabor, and from there to Hukok. It touches Zebulun in the south, Asher in the west, and Judah in the east at the Jordan. 
JOS.19.35	 The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, 
JOS.19.36	 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
JOS.19.37	 Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor, 
JOS.19.38	 Yiron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemeth. There were 19 cities with their villages. 
JOS.19.39	 These cities with their villages are the inheritance for the families of the tribe of Naphtali.
JOS.19.40	 The seventh lot was drawn for the families of the tribe of Dan. 
JOS.19.41	 The territory of their inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh, 
JOS.19.42	 Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 
JOS.19.43	 Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
JOS.19.44	 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
JOS.19.45	 Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon, 
JOS.19.46	 Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border passing in front of Joppa. 
JOS.19.47	 The border of Dan extended beyond them. Dan’s descendants went up and attacked Leshem, captured it, and killed everyone there. They took it, settled there, and renamed the city Dan after their ancestor Dan. 
JOS.19.48	 These cities with their villages are the inheritance for the families of the tribe of Dan.
JOS.19.49	 When they all had finally received the land they were to inherit, the people of Israel also gave land within their territory as an inheritance to Joshua, son of Nun. 
JOS.19.50	 They gave him the city he asked for, as the L
JOS.19.51	 This is the land that the tribes of Israel drew by lot. The priest Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the families divided the land by drawing lots. They did this in Shiloh in the presence of the L

JOS.20.2	 “Tell the people of Israel, ‘Now choose for yourselves the cities of refuge about which I spoke to you through Moses. 
JOS.20.3	 Choose them so that anyone who unintentionally kills someone may run to them. They will be a place of refuge from any relative who can avenge the death.
JOS.20.4	 “‘A person who kills someone accidentally can run to one of these cities. There he will stand at the entrance to the city, where court is held, and present his case to the leaders of that city. Then they will take him into their city and give him a place to live with them.
JOS.20.5	 “‘If the relative who can avenge the death pursues him, the leaders must not hand him over to the relative because he didn’t intend to kill the other person. He didn’t even hate the person he killed. 
JOS.20.6	 The accused person may remain in that city until he can stand trial in front of the congregation or until whoever is chief priest at that time dies. Then he may go back to his home in the city from which he ran away.’ ”
JOS.20.7	 Kedesh in Galilee in the mountains of Naphtali, Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (now called Hebron) in the mountains of Judah were chosen as cities of refuge. 
JOS.20.8	 Bezer on the desert plateau from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh were chosen as cities of refuge on the east side of the Jordan River, east of Jericho.
JOS.20.9	 These are the cities chosen as cities of refuge for all Israelites, including the foreigners living among them. Anyone who accidentally kills someone may escape to these cities. Then he will not be handed over to the relative who can avenge a death before he stands trial in front of the congregation.
JOS.21.1	 Then the leaders of the families of Levi came to the priest Eleazar, to Joshua (son of Nun), and to the leaders of the families of the other Israelite tribes 
JOS.21.2	 at Shiloh in Canaan. They said to them, “The L
JOS.21.3	 So, as the L
JOS.21.4	 These are the cities for the families of Kohath that were chosen by drawing lots. These descendants of the priest Aaron the Levite received 13 cities from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. 
JOS.21.5	 The rest of Kohath’s descendants received 10 cities from the families of the tribes of Ephraim and Dan and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
JOS.21.6	 Gershon’s descendants received 13 cities from the families of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and half of the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
JOS.21.7	 Merari’s descendants received 12 cities for their families from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun. 
JOS.21.8	 The Israelites gave these cities with pasturelands to Levi’s descendants by drawing lots, as the L
JOS.21.9	 These are the names of the cities from the tribes of Judah and Simeon 
JOS.21.10	 that they gave Aaron’s descendants who were from the families of Kohath in the tribe of Levi. Their lot was the first one drawn. 
JOS.21.11	 They gave them Kiriath Arba (Arba was Anak’s father) and the pastureland around it. This is the city of Hebron located in the mountains of Judah. 
JOS.21.12	 But they gave its fields and villages to Caleb, son of Jephunneh, as his possession. 
JOS.21.13	 So they gave the following cities with pasturelands to the descendants of Aaron, the priest. The nine cities from those two tribes were Hebron (a city of refuge for murderers), Libnah, 
JOS.21.14	 Jattir, Eshtemoa, 
JOS.21.15	 Holon, Debir, 
JOS.21.16	 Ain, Juttah, and Beth Shemesh. 
JOS.21.17	 The tribe of Benjamin also gave them four cities: Gibeon, Geba, 
JOS.21.18	 Anathoth, and Almon. 
JOS.21.19	 In all, 13 cities with pasturelands were given to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
JOS.21.20	 Cities were chosen by lot from the tribe of Ephraim to give to the rest of Levi’s descendants who were from the families of Kohath. 
JOS.21.21	 These four cities with pasturelands were Shechem (a city of refuge for murderers) in the mountains of Ephraim, Gezer, 
JOS.21.22	 Kibzaim, and Beth Horon. 
JOS.21.23	 The tribe of Dan gave them four cities: Eltekeh, Gibbethon, 
JOS.21.24	 Aijalon, and Gath Rimmon. 
JOS.21.25	 Half of the tribe of Manasseh gave them two cities with pasturelands: Taanach and Gath Rimmon. 
JOS.21.26	 In all, ten cities with pasturelands were given to the rest of the families of Kohath.
JOS.21.27	 They gave the families of Gershon’s descendants, who were in the tribe of Levi, two cities with pasturelands from half of the tribe of Manasseh: Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge for murderers) and Ashtaroth. 
JOS.21.28	 Four cities with pasturelands were also given to them from the tribe of Issachar: Kishion, Daberath, 
JOS.21.29	 Jarmuth, and En Gannim. 
JOS.21.30	 Another four cities with pasturelands were given to them from the tribe of Asher: Mishal, Abdon, 
JOS.21.31	 Helkath, and Rehob. 
JOS.21.32	 Also three cities with pasturelands were given to them from the tribe of Naphtali: Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for murderers), Hammoth Dor, and Kartan. 
JOS.21.33	 In all, 13 cities with pasturelands were given to Gershon’s families.
JOS.21.34	 To the families of Merari, who were from the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Zebulun gave four cities with pasturelands: Jokneam, Kartah, 
JOS.21.35	 Dimnah, and Nahalal. 
JOS.21.36	 The tribe of Reuben also gave them four cities with pasturelands: Bezer, Jahaz, 
JOS.21.37	 Kedemoth, and Mephaath. 
JOS.21.38	 The tribe of Gad also gave them four cities with pasturelands: Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge for murderers), Mahanaim, 
JOS.21.39	 Heshbon, and Jazer. 
JOS.21.40	 All these cities belonged to the families of Merari. They were the last of the families of Levi. These 12 cities were chosen by lot.
JOS.21.41	 Within the territory owned by the Israelites there were 48 cities in all for Levi’s descendants. 
JOS.21.42	 Each of these cities had its own pastureland around it.

JOS.22.6	 Then Joshua blessed them. He sent them on their way, and they went to their homes.
JOS.22.7	 Moses had given land in Bashan as an inheritance to half of Manasseh, and Joshua had given the other half of the tribe their land with their relatives west of the Jordan. When Joshua sent them home, he blessed them. 
JOS.22.8	 He also said to them, “Return to your homes with your vast wealth, large herds of livestock, silver, gold, bronze, iron, and loads of clothing. Divide the loot from your enemies with your relatives.”
JOS.22.9	 So the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh left the rest of the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan. They returned to Gilead. This was their own possession which they had captured as the L
JOS.22.10	 Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh came to the region of the Jordan that was still in Canaan. They built an altar by the Jordan River. The altar was very large and highly visible. 
JOS.22.11	 The rest of the Israelites heard about it and said, “See there! Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the border of Canaan. It’s in the region near the Jordan River on Israel’s side.” 
JOS.22.12	 When the people of Israel heard about it, the whole congregation of Israel gathered at Shiloh. They intended to wage war against them.
JOS.22.13	 The Israelites sent Phinehas, son of the priest Eleazar, to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh in Gilead. 
JOS.22.14	 Ten leaders, one from each tribe in Israel, went with him. Each man was a leader of a household and head of a family division in Israel. 
JOS.22.15	 When they arrived these leaders said to the people of Gilead, 
JOS.22.16	 “All of the L

JOS.22.21	 Then the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh answered the heads of the divisions of Israel. 
JOS.22.22	 They said, “The L

JOS.22.30	 When the priest Phinehas, the leaders of the congregation, and the heads of the divisions of Israel heard what the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh said, they were satisfied.

JOS.22.32	 Then Phinehas (son of the priest Eleazar) and the leaders returned from Reuben and Gad in Gilead to Israel in Canaan and gave them the report. 
JOS.22.33	 The people of Israel were satisfied with the report. So they praised God and didn’t talk anymore about going to war against Reuben and Gad and destroying the land where they were living.

JOS.24.5	 “Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt with plagues. Later I led you out.

JOS.24.10	 But I refused to listen to Balaam. All he could do was bless you. So I saved you from his power.
JOS.24.11	 “Then you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho, the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites fought you. But I handed them over to you.

JOS.24.33	 Aaron’s son Eleazar also died. He was buried on the hill that had been given to his son Phinehas in the mountains of Ephraim.

JDG.1.3	 The tribe of Judah said to the tribe of Simeon, “Come with us into the territory given to us when we drew lots, and together we will fight the people of Canaan. Then we’ll go with you into your territory.” So the tribe of Simeon went along with Judah.
JDG.1.4	 Judah’s troops went into battle, and the L
JDG.1.5	 At Bezek they also caught up with Adoni Bezek. They fought him and defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites. 
JDG.1.6	 Adoni Bezek fled. Judah’s troops chased him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 
JDG.1.7	 Adoni Bezek said, “Seventy kings who had their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up food under my table. God has paid me back for what I did to them.” Judah’s troops brought Adoni Bezek to Jerusalem, where he died.
JDG.1.8	 The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They killed everyone there and set the city on fire. 
JDG.1.9	 After that, the men of Judah went to fight the Canaanites who lived in the mountains, the Negev, and the foothills. 
JDG.1.10	 Then they went to fight the Canaanites who lived at Hebron. (In the past Hebron was called Kiriath Arba.) There they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
JDG.1.11	 From there Judah’s troops went to fight the people living at Debir. (In the past Debir was called Kiriath Sepher.) 
JDG.1.12	 Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Achsah as a wife to whoever defeats Kiriath Sepher and captures it.” 
JDG.1.13	 Then Othniel, son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz, captured it. So Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. 
JDG.1.14	 When she came to Othniel, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want?”
JDG.1.15	 She answered, “Give me a blessing. Since you’ve given me some dry land, also give me some springs.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
JDG.1.16	 The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went with the people of Judah from the City of Palms into the desert of Judah. There they lived with the people of Judah in the Negev near Arad.
JDG.1.17	 The tribe of Judah went to fight along with the tribe of Simeon, their close relatives. They defeated the Canaanites who lived in Zephath and claimed it for the L
JDG.1.18	 Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron with their territories.

JDG.1.20	 As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who forced out the three sons of Anak.
JDG.1.21	 The men of Benjamin did not force out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem. The Jebusites still live with the tribe of Benjamin in Jerusalem today.
JDG.1.22	 The descendants of Joseph also went into battle against Bethel, and the L
JDG.1.23	 They sent men to spy on Bethel. (In the past the city was called Luz.) 
JDG.1.24	 The spies saw a man coming out of the city. They told him, “Show us how we can get into the city, and we’ll treat you kindly.” 
JDG.1.25	 He showed them. So they got into the city and killed everyone there. But they let that man and his whole family go free. 
JDG.1.26	 The man went to the land of the Hittites. There he built a city and called it Luz. The city still has that name today.
JDG.1.27	 Now, the tribe of Manasseh did not force out the people of Beth Shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo or their villages. The Canaanites were determined to live in this land. 
JDG.1.28	 When the Israelites were strong enough, they made the Canaanites do forced labor. But they did not force all of them out.
JDG.1.29	 The tribe of Ephraim did not force out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer. So the Canaanites continued to live with them in Gezer.
JDG.1.30	 The tribe of Zebulun did not force out those who lived at Kitron or Nahalol. So the Canaanites continued to live with them and were made to do forced labor.
JDG.1.31	 The tribe of Asher did not force out those who lived at Acco or Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphek, or Rehob. 
JDG.1.32	 So the tribe of Asher continued to live with the Canaanites because they did not force them out.
JDG.1.33	 The tribe of Naphtali did not force out those who lived at Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath. So they continued to live with the Canaanites. But the people of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were made to do forced labor.
JDG.1.34	 The Amorites forced the tribe of Dan into the mountains and would not let them come down into the valley.
JDG.1.35	 The Amorites were determined to live at Har Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But when the tribes of Joseph became stronger, they made the Amorites do forced labor. 
JDG.1.36	 The territory of the Amorites extended from the Akrabbim Pass—from Selah northward.

JDG.2.19	 But after each judge died, the people went back to their old ways and acted more corruptly than their parents. They followed, served, and worshiped other gods. They never gave up their evil practices and stubborn ways.

JDG.3.4	 These nations were left to test the Israelites, to find out if they would obey the commands the L
JDG.3.5	 So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
JDG.3.6	 The Israelites allowed their sons and daughters to marry these people. Israel also served their gods.
JDG.3.7	 The people of Israel did what the L

JDG.3.12	 Once again, the people of Israel did what the L
JDG.3.13	 Eglon got the Ammonites and the Amalekites to help him, and they defeated the Israelites and occupied the City of Palms. 
JDG.3.14	 The Israelites served King Eglon of Moab for 18 years.
JDG.3.15	 Then the people of Israel cried out to the L
JDG.3.15	The people sent him with their tax payment to King Eglon of Moab. 
JDG.3.16	 Ehud made a two-edged dagger for himself. He fastened it to his right side under his clothes. 
JDG.3.17	 Then he brought the tax payment to King Eglon. (Eglon was a very fat man.) 
JDG.3.18	 When Ehud had finished delivering the payment, he sent back the men who had carried it. 
JDG.3.19	 However, Ehud turned around at the stone idols near Gilgal ⌊and returned to Eglon⌋. He said, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.”
JDG.3.19	The king replied, “Keep quiet!” Then all his advisers left the room.
JDG.3.20	 Ehud came up to him as he sat alone in his room on the roof. He said to the king, “I have a message from God for you.” As the king rose from his throne, 
JDG.3.21	 Ehud reached with his left hand, took the dagger from his right side, and plunged it into Eglon’s belly. 
JDG.3.22	 Even the handle went in after the blade. Eglon’s fat covered the blade because Ehud didn’t pull the dagger out. The blade stuck out in back.
JDG.3.23	 Ehud left the room.
JDG.3.24	 After Ehud went out, Eglon’s advisers came in. They were surprised that the doors were locked. “He must be using the toilet,” they said. 
JDG.3.25	 They waited and waited, but Eglon didn’t open the doors. So they took the key and opened the door. They were shocked to see their ruler lying on the floor, dead.
JDG.3.26	 While they had been waiting, Ehud escaped. He went past the stone idols and escaped to Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	 When he arrived there, he blew a ram’s horn in the mountains of Ephraim ⌊to summon the troops⌋. So the troops of Israel came down from the mountains with him, and he led them. 
JDG.3.28	 He told them, “Follow me! The L
JDG.3.28	They followed him and captured the shallow crossings of the Jordan River that led to Moab and refused to let anyone cross. 
JDG.3.29	 At that time they killed about ten thousand of Moab’s best fighting men. Not one of them escaped. 
JDG.3.30	 The power of Moab was crushed by Israel that day. So there was finally peace in the land for 80 years.
JDG.3.31	 After Ehud came Shamgar, son of Anath. He killed 600 Philistines with a sharp stick used for herding oxen. So he, too, rescued Israel.
JDG.4.1	 After Ehud died, the people of Israel again did what the L
JDG.4.2	 So the L
JDG.4.3	 The people of Israel cried out to the L
JDG.4.4	 Deborah, wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet. She was the judge in Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	 She used to sit under the Palm Tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. The people of Israel would come to her for legal decisions.
JDG.4.6	 Deborah summoned Barak, son of Abinoam, from Kedesh in Naphtali. She told him, “The L
JDG.4.7	 I will lead Sisera (the commander of Jabin’s army), his chariots, and troops to you at the Kishon River. I will hand him over to you.’ ”
JDG.4.8	 Barak said to her, “If you go with me, I’ll go. But if you don’t go with me, I won’t go.”
JDG.4.9	 Deborah replied, “Certainly, I’ll go with you. But you won’t win any honors for the way you’re going about this, because the L
JDG.4.9	So Deborah started out for Kedesh with Barak. 
JDG.4.10	 Barak called the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali together at Kedesh. Ten thousand men went to fight under his command. Deborah also went along with him.
JDG.4.11	 Heber the Kenite had separated from the other Kenites (the descendants of Hobab, Moses’ father-in-law). Heber went as far away as the oak tree at Zaanannim near Kedesh and set up his tent.
JDG.4.12	 The report reached Sisera that Barak, son of Abinoam, had come to fight at Mount Tabor. 
JDG.4.13	 So Sisera summoned all his chariots (900 chariots made of iron) and all his troops from Harosheth Haggoyim to come to the Kishon River.
JDG.4.14	 Then Deborah said to Barak, “Attack! This is the day the L
JDG.4.14	So Barak came down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men behind him. 
JDG.4.15	 The L
JDG.4.16	 Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth Haggoyim. So Sisera’s whole army was killed in combat. Not one man survived.
JDG.4.17	 Meanwhile, Sisera fled on foot toward the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. Sisera did this because King Jabin of Hazor and Heber’s family were on peaceful terms. 
JDG.4.18	 When Jael came out ⌊of her tent⌋, she met Sisera. She told him, “Sir, come in here! Come into my tent. Don’t be afraid.” So he went into her tent, and she hid him under a tent curtain.
JDG.4.19	 Sisera said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink. I’m thirsty.” But instead she gave him milk to drink and covered him up again.
JDG.4.20	 He said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent. If anyone comes and asks if there has been a man around here, tell them no.”
JDG.4.21	 When Sisera had fallen sound asleep from exhaustion, Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and walked quietly toward him with a hammer in her hand. She hammered the tent peg through his temples into the ground. So Sisera died.
JDG.4.22	 Barak was still pursuing Sisera. When Jael came out ⌊of her tent⌋, she met him. She said to him, “Come in! I have something to show you—the man you’ve been looking for.” So Barak went into her tent. He saw Sisera lying there dead with the tent peg through his temples.
JDG.4.23	 So on that day, God used the people of Israel to crush the power of King Jabin of Canaan. 
JDG.4.24	 The Israelites became stronger and stronger until they destroyed him.
JDG.5.1	 On that day Deborah and Barak, son of Abinoam, sang this song:
JDG.5.2	 Praise the L
JDG.5.2	Men in Israel vowed to fight,
JDG.5.2	and people volunteered for service.
JDG.5.3	 Listen, you kings!
JDG.5.3	Open your ears, you princes!
JDG.5.3	I will sing a song to the L
JDG.5.3	I will make music to the L
JDG.5.4	 O L
JDG.5.4	when you went out from Seir,
JDG.5.4	when you marched from the country of Edom,
JDG.5.4	the earth quaked,
JDG.5.4	the sky poured,
JDG.5.4	the clouds burst,
JDG.5.5	 and the mountains shook
JDG.5.5	in the presence of the L
JDG.5.5	in the presence of the L
JDG.5.6	 In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath,
JDG.5.6	in the days of Jael,
JDG.5.6	roads were deserted.
JDG.5.6	Those who traveled took back roads.
JDG.5.7	 Villages in Israel were deserted—
JDG.5.7	deserted until I, Deborah, took a stand—
JDG.5.7	took a stand as a mother of Israel.
JDG.5.8	 When the people chose new gods,
JDG.5.8	war broke out inside the city gates.
JDG.5.8	Not a weapon was seen among 40,000 in Israel.
JDG.5.9	 My heart goes out to Israel’s commanders,
JDG.5.9	to those people who volunteered.
JDG.5.9	Praise the L
JDG.5.10	 You people who ride on brown donkeys,
JDG.5.10	who sit on saddle blankets,
JDG.5.10	and who walk on the road—think.
JDG.5.11	 Listen to the voices of those singing at the wells.
JDG.5.11	Over and over again they repeat
JDG.5.11	the victories of the L
JDG.5.11	the victories for his villages in Israel.
JDG.5.11	Then the L
JDG.5.12	 Get up! Get up, Deborah!
JDG.5.12	Get up! Get up and create a song!
JDG.5.12	Barak, attack! Take your prisoners, son of Abinoam.
JDG.5.13	 Then those mighty men who were left came down.
JDG.5.13	The L
JDG.5.14	 Those who had settled in Amalek’s country
JDG.5.14	came down from Ephraim.
JDG.5.14	Benjamin came with its troops
JDG.5.14	after Ephraim.
JDG.5.14	Commanders from Machir went into battle.
JDG.5.14	The officers from Zebulun also went.
JDG.5.15	 Issachar’s commanders were with Deborah.
JDG.5.15	They were also with Barak,
JDG.5.15	sent into the valley under his command.
JDG.5.15	Among Reuben’s divisions important men had second thoughts.
JDG.5.16	 Why did you sit between the saddlebags?
JDG.5.16	Was it to listen to the shepherds playing their flutes?
JDG.5.16	Reuben’s divisions of important men had second thoughts.
JDG.5.17	 Gilead remained east of the Jordan River.
JDG.5.17	And Dan. . . Why did he stay by the ships?
JDG.5.17	Asher sat on the seashore and remained along the inlets.
JDG.5.18	 But Zebulun mocked death,
JDG.5.18	and Naphtali risked his life on the battlefield.
JDG.5.19	 Kings came and fought.
JDG.5.19	Then the kings of Canaan fought.
JDG.5.19	They fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.
JDG.5.19	But they didn’t carry off any rich loot.
JDG.5.20	 The stars fought from heaven.
JDG.5.20	They fought against Sisera from their heavenly paths.
JDG.5.21	 The Kishon River swept them away—
JDG.5.21	that old river, the Kishon.
JDG.5.21	I must march on with strength!
JDG.5.22	 Then the horses’ hoofs pounded.
JDG.5.22	The mighty war horses galloped on and on.
JDG.5.23	 “Curse Meroz!” said the Messenger of the L
JDG.5.23	“Bitterly curse those who live there!
JDG.5.23	They did not come to help the L
JDG.5.23	to help the L
JDG.5.24	 Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite,
JDG.5.24	should be the most blessed woman,
JDG.5.24	the most blessed woman living in a tent.
JDG.5.25	 Sisera asked for water.
JDG.5.25	She gave him milk.
JDG.5.25	She offered him buttermilk in a royal bowl.
JDG.5.26	 She reached for a tent peg with one hand,
JDG.5.26	for a workman’s hammer with the other.
JDG.5.26	She struck Sisera.
JDG.5.26	She crushed his head.
JDG.5.26	She shattered and pierced his temples.
JDG.5.27	 He sank.
JDG.5.27	He fell.
JDG.5.27	He lay between her feet!
JDG.5.27	He sank.
JDG.5.27	He fell between her feet.
JDG.5.27	Where he sank, he fell dead.
JDG.5.28	 Sisera’s mother looked through her window
JDG.5.28	and cried as she peered through the lattice.
JDG.5.28	“Why is his chariot taking so long?
JDG.5.28	Why don’t I hear the clatter of his chariots?”
JDG.5.29	 Her wisest servants gave her an answer.
JDG.5.29	But she kept repeating to herself,
JDG.5.30	 “They’re really finding and dividing the loot:
JDG.5.30	A girl or two for each soldier,
JDG.5.30	colorful clothes for Sisera,
JDG.5.30	colorful, embroidered clothes,
JDG.5.30	and two pieces of colorful, embroidered cloth
JDG.5.30	for the neck of the looter.”
JDG.5.31	 May all your enemies die like that, O L
JDG.5.31	But may those who love the L
JDG.5.31	be like the sun when it rises in all its brightness.
JDG.5.31	So the land had peace for 40 years.
JDG.6.1	 The people of Israel did what the L
JDG.6.2	 Midian’s power was too strong for Israel. The Israelites made hiding places in the mountains, caves, and mountain strongholds ⌊to protect themselves⌋ from Midian. 
JDG.6.3	 Whenever Israel planted crops, Midian, Amalek, and Kedem came and damaged the crops. 
JDG.6.4	 The enemy used to camp on the land and destroy the crops all the way to Gaza. They left nothing for Israel to live on—not one sheep, cow, or donkey. 
JDG.6.5	 Like swarms of locusts, they came with their livestock and their tents. They and their camels could not be counted. They came into the land only to ruin it. 
JDG.6.6	 So the Israelites became very poor because of Midian and cried out to the L
JDG.6.7	 When the people of Israel cried out to the L
JDG.6.8	 the L
JDG.6.8	I brought you out of Egypt.
JDG.6.8	I took you away from slavery.
JDG.6.9	 I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians
JDG.6.9	and from the power of those who oppressed you.
JDG.6.9	I forced people out of your way.
JDG.6.9	I gave you their land.
JDG.6.10	 I said to you, ‘I am the L
JDG.6.10	You must never fear the gods of the Amorites
JDG.6.10	in whose land you will live.’
JDG.6.10	But you have not obeyed me.”
JDG.6.11	 The Messenger of the L
JDG.6.12	 The Messenger of the L
JDG.6.13	 Gideon responded, “Excuse me, sir! But if the L
JDG.6.14	 The L
JDG.6.15	 Gideon said to him, “Excuse me, sir! How can I rescue Israel? Look at my whole family. It’s the weakest one in Manasseh. And me? I’m the least important member of my family.”
JDG.6.16	 The L
JDG.6.17	 Gideon said to him, “If you find me acceptable, give me a sign that it is really you speaking to me. 
JDG.6.18	 Don’t leave until I come back. I want to bring my gift and set it in front of you.”
JDG.6.18	“I will stay until you come back,” he said.
JDG.6.19	 Then Gideon went into ⌊his house⌋ and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread made with 18 quarts of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. Then he went out and presented them to the Messenger of the L
JDG.6.20	 The Messenger of the L
JDG.6.21	 Then the Messenger of the L
JDG.6.22	 That’s when Gideon realized that this had been the Messenger of the L
JDG.6.23	 The L
JDG.6.24	 So Gideon built an altar there to the L
JDG.6.25	 That same night the L
JDG.6.26	 Then, in the proper way, build an altar to the L
JDG.6.27	 Gideon took ten of his servants and did what the L
JDG.6.28	 When the men of the city got up early in the morning, they saw that the Baal altar had been torn down. The Asherah pole next to it had also been cut down. They saw that the second bull had been sacrificed as a burnt offering on the altar that had been built. 
JDG.6.29	 They asked each other, “Who did this?” While they were investigating the matter, someone said, “Gideon, son of Joash, did this.”
JDG.6.30	 Then the men of the city told Joash, “Bring your son out. He must die. He has torn down the Baal altar and cut down the Asherah pole that was beside it.”
JDG.6.31	 But Joash said to everyone standing around him, “You’re not going to defend Baal, are you? Do you think you should save him? Whoever defends him will be put to death in the morning. If he’s a god, let him defend himself when someone tears down his altar.” 
JDG.6.32	 So that day they nicknamed Gideon “Jerubbaal” [Let Baal Defend Himself], because they said, “When someone tears down Baal’s altar, let Baal defend himself.”
JDG.6.33	 All of Midian, Amalek, and Kedem combined their armies, crossed ⌊the Jordan River⌋, and camped in the valley of Jezreel. 
JDG.6.34	 Then the L
JDG.6.35	 He also sent messengers throughout Manasseh to summon the people to follow him. The tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali were also summoned to follow him, and they went to meet the enemy in battle.
JDG.6.36	 Then Gideon said to God, “You said that you would rescue Israel through me. 
JDG.6.37	 I’ll place some wool on the threshing floor.
JDG.6.38	 And that is what happened. The next morning Gideon got up early. He squeezed out a bowl full of water from the wool.
JDG.6.39	 Then Gideon said to God, “Don’t be angry with me. But let me ask one more thing. Let me make one more test with the wool. Let the wool be dry while all the ground is covered with dew.” 
JDG.6.40	 During the night, God did what Gideon asked. The wool was dry, but all the ground was covered with dew.
JDG.7.1	 Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the troops with him got up early and camped above En Harod. Midian’s camp was north of him at the hill of Moreh in the valley.
JDG.7.2	 The L
JDG.7.3	 Announce to the troops, ‘Whoever is scared or frightened should leave Mount Gilead and go back home.’” So 22,000 men went back home, and 10,000 were left.
JDG.7.4	 The L
JDG.7.5	 So Gideon took the men down to the water. The L
JDG.7.6	 Three hundred men lapped water with their hands to their mouths. All the rest of the men knelt down to drink water. 
JDG.7.7	 Then the L
JDG.7.8	 So Gideon sent the other men of Israel home, but the 300 men who stayed kept all the supplies and rams’ horns.
JDG.7.8	The camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
JDG.7.9	 That night the L
JDG.7.10	 But if you’re afraid to go, take your servant Purah to the camp with you. 
JDG.7.11	 Listen to what people are saying. After that, you will have the courage to go into the camp and attack it.”
JDG.7.11	So Gideon and his servant Purah went to the edge of the camp. 
JDG.7.12	 Midian, Amalek, and all of Kedem were spread out in the valley like a swarm of locusts. There were so many camels that they could not be counted. They were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore.
JDG.7.13	 When Gideon got there, he heard a man telling his friend a dream. The man said, “I had a strange dream. There was a loaf of barley bread rolling around in the camp of Midian. When it got to the command post, the loaf of bread hit that tent so hard that the tent collapsed, turned upside down, and fell flat.”
JDG.7.14	 His friend replied, “That can only be the sword of Gideon, son of Joash, from Israel. God is going to hand Midian and the whole camp over to him.”
JDG.7.15	 When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped the L
JDG.7.16	 Gideon divided the 300 men into three companies. He gave them each rams’ horns and jars with torches inside. 
JDG.7.17	 He said to them, “Watch me, and do what I do. When I come to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do. 
JDG.7.18	 When I and those with me blow our rams’ horns, then the rest of you around the camp do the same and shout, ‘For the L
JDG.7.19	 Gideon and his 100 men came to the edge of the camp. It was the beginning of the midnight watch just at the change of the guards. They blew their rams’ horns and smashed the jars they were holding in their hands. 
JDG.7.20	 The three companies also blew their rams’ horns and broke their jars. They held the torches in their left hands and the rams’ horns in their right hands so that they could blow them. They shouted, “A sword for the L
JDG.7.21	 While each man kept his position around the camp, everyone in the Midianite camp began to run away, screaming as they fled. 
JDG.7.22	 The 300 men kept on blowing their rams’ horns, and the L
JDG.7.23	 The men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh to help pursue the troops of Midian. 
JDG.7.24	 Gideon also sent messengers to the whole mountain region of Ephraim with this message, “Go into battle against Midian. Capture the watering holes as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan River.” All the men of Ephraim were also summoned to help. They captured the watering holes as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan River. 
JDG.7.25	 They also captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two Midianite commanders. They killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb and kept on pursuing Midian. Then they brought the severed heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan River.
JDG.8.1	 The men from Ephraim strongly protested Gideon’s actions. They said, “Why did you do this to us? You didn’t invite us to go fight Midian with you.”
JDG.8.2	 Gideon replied, “I haven’t done anything compared with what you have done. Aren’t the grapes that Ephraim picked after the harvest better than all the grapes in Abiezer’s entire harvest? 
JDG.8.3	 God handed Oreb and Zeeb, Midian’s commanders, over to you. What have I done compared with that?” When they heard what Gideon said, they weren’t angry with him anymore.
JDG.8.4	 Gideon and his 300 men headed toward the Jordan River. They were exhausted when they crossed it, but they kept pursuing the enemy. 
JDG.8.5	 So Gideon said to the men of Succoth, “Please give me some food for the men under my command. They’re exhausted, and I’m pursuing King Zebah and King Zalmunna of Midian.”
JDG.8.6	 The generals at Succoth replied, “We shouldn’t give your army food. You haven’t captured Zebah and Zalmunna yet.”
JDG.8.7	 Gideon responded, “Alright, then. When the L
JDG.8.8	 Then Gideon went to Penuel and asked the people there for the same help. But they gave him the same reply that the men of Succoth gave. 
JDG.8.9	 So he told them, “When I come back after my victory, I’ll tear down this tower.”
JDG.8.10	 Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with an army of about 15,000 men. This was all that was left of Kedem’s entire army. In the battle, 120,000 soldiers died. 
JDG.8.11	 So Gideon went up Tent Dwellers Road, east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and defeated the unsuspecting Midianite army. 
JDG.8.12	 Zebah and Zalmunna fled as Gideon pursued them. He captured King Zebah and King Zalmunna of Midian, and the whole Midianite army panicked.
JDG.8.13	 Gideon, son of Joash, returned from the battle through the Heres Pass 
JDG.8.14	 and captured a young man from Succoth. He questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the 77 officials and leaders of Succoth. 
JDG.8.15	 Gideon went to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna! You insulted me when you said, ‘We shouldn’t give your exhausted men food before you’ve captured Zebah and Zalmunna.’” 
JDG.8.16	 So Gideon took the leaders of the city and taught them a lesson using thorns and thistles from the desert. 
JDG.8.17	 Then he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of that city.
JDG.8.18	 He asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?”
JDG.8.18	They answered, “They were like you. Each one looked like a king’s son.”
JDG.8.19	 Gideon replied, “They were my brothers, my mother’s sons. I solemnly swear, as the L
JDG.8.20	 Then he told Jether, his firstborn son, “Get up and kill them!” But Jether didn’t draw his sword. He was afraid because he was only a young man.
JDG.8.21	 Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Get up and do it yourself! It’s a man’s job!” So Gideon got up and killed them. Then he took the half-moon ornaments that were on their camels’ necks.
JDG.8.22	 The men of Israel said to Gideon, “You, then your son, and then your grandson, must rule us. You rescued us from Midian.”
JDG.8.23	 Gideon replied, “I will not rule you nor will my son. The L
JDG.8.24	 Then Gideon said to them, “Do me a favor. Each of you give me the earrings from your loot.” (Their enemies, the Ishmaelites, wore gold earrings.)
JDG.8.25	 The men of Israel answered, “Yes, we’ll give them to you.” So they spread out a coat. Each man took the earrings from his loot and dropped them on it. 
JDG.8.26	 The gold earrings Gideon had asked for weighed 40 pounds. This did not include the half-moon ornaments, the earrings, the purple clothes worn by the kings of Midian, and the chains from their camels’ necks. 
JDG.8.27	 Then Gideon used the gold to make an idol 
JDG.8.28	 The power of Midian was crushed by the people of Israel, and Midian never again became a threat. So the land had peace for 40 years during Gideon’s life.
JDG.8.29	 Jerubbaal, son of Joash, went home to live. 
JDG.8.30	 Gideon had 70 sons because he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	 His concubine 
JDG.8.32	 Gideon, son of Joash, died at a very old age. He was buried in the tomb of his father Joash at Ophrah, the city belonging to Abiezer’s family.
JDG.8.33	 As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel chased after other gods—the Baals—as though they were prostitutes. They made Baal Berith their god. 
JDG.8.34	 The Israelites did not remember the L
JDG.8.35	 And they were not kind to the family of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) despite all the good he had done for Israel.
JDG.9.1	 Abimelech, son of Jerubbaal [Gideon], went to Shechem to see the uncles on his mother’s side of the family. He spoke to them and his mother’s whole family. 
JDG.9.2	 He said, “Please ask all citizens of Shechem, ‘What seems best to you? Do you really want all of Jerubbaal’s 70 sons to rule you or just one man? Remember, I’m your own flesh and blood.’ ”
JDG.9.3	 His uncles repeated everything he said to all citizens of Shechem. They were persuaded to follow Abimelech because he was their relative. 
JDG.9.4	 So they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the temple of Baal Berith. With the silver, Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men to follow him. 
JDG.9.5	 Then he went to his father’s home in Ophrah. There he executed his 70 brothers, Jerubbaal’s sons. But Jotham, Jerubbaal’s youngest son, survived because he hid. 
JDG.9.6	 All the citizens from Shechem and Beth Millo united. They went to the oak tree that was still standing in Shechem and proclaimed Abimelech king.
JDG.9.7	 When Jotham was told about this, he went to a high spot on Mount Gerizim. He shouted to them, “Listen to me, you citizens of Shechem, so that God might listen to you.
JDG.9.8	 “The trees went to anoint someone to be king over them.
JDG.9.8	They said to the olive tree,
JDG.9.8	‘Be our king!’
JDG.9.9	 But the olive tree responded,
JDG.9.9	‘Should I stop producing oil,
JDG.9.9	which people use to honor gods and humans,
JDG.9.9	in order to rule the trees?’
JDG.9.10	 Then the trees said to the fig tree,
JDG.9.10	‘You come and be our king!’
JDG.9.11	 But the fig tree responded,
JDG.9.11	‘Should I stop producing my good, sweet fruit
JDG.9.11	in order to rule the trees?’
JDG.9.12	 Then the trees said to the grapevine,
JDG.9.12	‘You come and be our king!’
JDG.9.13	 But the grapevine responded,
JDG.9.13	‘Should I stop producing my wine,
JDG.9.13	which makes gods and humans happy,
JDG.9.13	in order to rule the trees?’
JDG.9.14	 Then all the trees said to the thornbush,
JDG.9.14	‘You come and be our king!’
JDG.9.15	 But the thornbush responded to the trees,
JDG.9.15	‘If you really want to anoint me to be your king,
JDG.9.15	then come and take shelter in my shade.
JDG.9.15	But if not, fire will come out of the thornbush
JDG.9.15	and burn up the cedars of Lebanon.’
JDG.9.16	 “If you acted with sincerity and integrity when you made Abimelech king, ⌊be happy.⌋ If you treated Jerubbaal and his family well, if you treated him as he deserved, be happy. 
JDG.9.17	 My father fought for you. He risked his life and rescued you from Midian. 
JDG.9.18	 But today you have attacked my father’s family. You have executed his 70 sons. You have made Abimelech, who is the son of my father’s slave girl, king over the citizens of Shechem just because he’s your brother. 
JDG.9.19	 So if you are now acting with sincerity and integrity toward Jerubbaal and his family, then be happy with Abimelech and let Abimelech be happy with you. 
JDG.9.20	 But if that’s not the case, let fire come out of Abimelech and burn up citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo. Also let fire come out of citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo and burn up Abimelech.”
JDG.9.21	 Then Jotham ran away quickly. He went to Beerah and lived there ⌊to avoid⌋ his brother Abimelech.
JDG.9.22	 Abimelech ruled Israel for three years. 
JDG.9.23	 Then God sent an evil spirit to cause problems between Abimelech and citizens of Shechem. So citizens of Shechem turned against Abimelech. 
JDG.9.24	 God did this so that the bloody violence committed against Jerubbaal’s 70 sons would happen to Abimelech and citizens of Shechem. Citizens of Shechem had helped Abimelech execute his brothers.
JDG.9.25	 So citizens of Shechem set ambushes for Abimelech on top of the mountains. They also robbed everyone who passed by them on the road. This was reported to Abimelech.
JDG.9.26	 Then Gaal (son of Ebed) and his brothers moved into Shechem. Citizens of Shechem trusted him. 
JDG.9.27	 They went into the country and harvested grapes in the vineyards to make wine. Then they made an offering of praise in the temple of their gods. They ate, drank, and cursed Abimelech. 
JDG.9.28	 Gaal (son of Ebed) said, “Who’s Abimelech, and who are we, the people of Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn’t he Jerubbaal’s son, and isn’t Zebul his officer? Serve the descendants of Hamor, Shechem’s father! Why should we serve Abimelech? 
JDG.9.29	 How I wish I controlled these people! Then I’d get rid of Abimelech. I would tell him,
JDG.9.30	 Zebul, Shechem’s ruler, heard what Gaal (son of Ebed) had said, and he became angry. 
JDG.9.31	 He secretly sent messengers to Abimelech. “Watch out! Gaal (son of Ebed) and his brothers have come to Shechem. They have turned the city against you. 
JDG.9.32	 You and your men must start out tonight. Set an ambush ⌊for them⌋ in the fields ⌊around Shechem⌋. 
JDG.9.33	 In the morning, when the sun rises, get up quickly and raid the city. When Gaal and his men come out to attack you, do whatever you want to him.”
JDG.9.34	 Abimelech and all his troops started out at night. He used four companies to set ambushes around Shechem. 
JDG.9.35	 Gaal (son of Ebed) went out and stood at the entrance to the city. Then Abimelech and his troops rose from their ambush. 
JDG.9.36	 When Gaal saw the troops, he said to Zebul, “Look, troops are coming down from the mountaintops!”
JDG.9.36	Zebul replied, “The shadows of the mountains look like men to you.”
JDG.9.37	 Gaal spoke again, “No, there are troops coming down from Tabbur Haares. One company is coming along the road by the Fortune tellers’ Tree.”
JDG.9.38	 Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your big mouth now? You were the one who said, ‘Who’s Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Aren’t these the troops ⌊whose ruler⌋ you despised? Now go out and fight him.”
JDG.9.39	 Then Gaal led citizens of Shechem out to fight Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	 Abimelech chased Gaal so that he ran away from him. Many were killed at the entrance of the city. 
JDG.9.41	 Abimelech continued to live at Arumah. Zebul threw Gaal and his brothers out and would not let them live in Shechem.
JDG.9.42	 The next day the people ⌊of Shechem⌋ went into the fields. Abimelech was told about it. 
JDG.9.43	 So he took his troops, divided them into three companies, and set an ambush in the fields. He watched and saw the people coming out of the city. Then he began to attack them. 
JDG.9.44	 Abimelech and his company charged the city and captured its entrance. The other two companies charged at everyone in the fields and attacked them. 
JDG.9.45	 Abimelech attacked the city all day long. He captured the city and killed the people in it. He also tore down the city and scattered salt all over the land.
JDG.9.46	 All the citizens of Shechem’s Tower heard about it and went into the basement of the temple of El Berith. 
JDG.9.47	 When Abimelech was told that they had gathered there, 
JDG.9.48	 he and all his men went to Mount Zalmon. Abimelech took an ax, cut some brushwood, and carried it on his shoulder. He told his men, “Hurry and do what you’ve seen me do!” 
JDG.9.49	 So all his troops also cut brushwood and followed Abimelech. They piled the brushwood on top of the basement and set it on fire with the people inside. So all the people in Shechem’s Tower died too. There were about a thousand men and women.
JDG.9.50	 Then Abimelech went to Thebez, camped there, and captured it. 
JDG.9.51	 Now, there was a strong tower inside the town. All the men, women, and leaders of the town fled to it. They locked the door behind them and went up on the roof of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	 Abimelech came to the tower. He began to fight against it and went near the entrance of the tower to burn it down. 
JDG.9.53	 Then a woman threw a small millstone that hit Abimelech on the head and cracked his skull. 
JDG.9.54	 He quickly called his armorbearer. He told him, “Take your sword and kill me! I don’t want anyone to say, ‘A woman killed Abimelech.’” His armorbearer did as he said, so Abimelech died. 
JDG.9.55	 When the people of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home.
JDG.9.56	 So God paid back Abimelech for the evil he had done to his father when he killed his 70 brothers. 
JDG.9.57	 God also paid back the men of Shechem for all their evil. So the curse of Jotham, son of Jerubbaal, came true.
JDG.10.1	 After Abimelech, Tola, who was the son of Puah and grandson of Dodo, came to rescue Israel. Tola was from Issachar and lived in Shamir in the mountains of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	 He judged Israel for 23 years. Tola died and was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	 After Tola, Jair from Gilead became a judge. He judged Israel for 22 years. 
JDG.10.4	 Jair had 30 sons who rode on 30 donkeys. He also had 30 towns that are still called Havvoth Jair to this day. They are in the region of Gilead. 
JDG.10.5	 Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
JDG.10.6	 The people of Israel again did what the L
JDG.10.7	 The L
JDG.10.8	 They oppressed and crushed the people of Israel that year. For 18 years they oppressed all who lived east of the Jordan River in the land of the Amorites in Gilead. 
JDG.10.9	 Ammon also crossed the Jordan River to fight the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. So Israel suffered a great deal.
JDG.10.10	 Then the people of Israel cried out to the L
JDG.10.11	 The L
JDG.10.12	 the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed you, you cried out to me for help. Didn’t I rescue you from them? 
JDG.10.13	 But you still abandoned me and served other gods. That’s why I won’t rescue you again. 
JDG.10.14	 Cry out for help to the gods you chose. Let them rescue you when you’re in trouble.”
JDG.10.15	 The people of Israel said to the L
JDG.10.16	 Then they got rid of the foreign gods they had and served the L
JDG.10.17	 The troops of Ammon were summoned to fight, and they camped at Gilead. The people of Israel also gathered together and camped at Mizpah. 
JDG.10.18	 The leaders of the people of Gilead said to each other, “Whoever starts the fight against Ammon will rule everyone who lives in Gilead.”
JDG.11.1	 Jephthah was a soldier from the region of Gilead. Jephthah’s father was named Gilead. His mother was a prostitute. 
JDG.11.2	 Gilead’s wife also gave birth to sons. When his wife’s sons grew up, they threw Jephthah out. They told him, “You’ll get no inheritance from our father. You’re the son of that other woman.” 
JDG.11.3	 Jephthah fled from his brothers. He went to live in the land of Tob. Worthless men gathered around Jephthah and went out ⌊on raids⌋ with him.
JDG.11.4	 Later, Ammon waged war with Israel. 
JDG.11.5	 When the Ammonites attacked Israel, Gilead’s leaders went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. 
JDG.11.6	 They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our commander so that we can wage war against Ammon.”
JDG.11.7	 But Jephthah replied to Gilead’s leaders, “Don’t you hate me? Didn’t you throw me out of my father’s house? So why are you coming to me now when you’re in trouble?”
JDG.11.8	 Gilead’s leaders answered Jephthah, “The reason we’ve turned to you now is that we want you to go with us and wage war against Ammon. You will be the ruler of everyone who lives in Gilead.”
JDG.11.9	 Jephthah told them, “If you take me back to fight against Ammonites and the L
JDG.11.10	 Gilead’s leaders said to Jephthah, “The L
JDG.11.11	 Jephthah went with them, and the people made him their leader and commander. So Jephthah went to Mizpah and repeated all these things in the presence of the L
JDG.11.12	 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon. They asked the king, “Why did you invade my land and wage war against me?”
JDG.11.13	 The king of Ammon answered Jephthah’s messengers, “When the people of Israel left Egypt, they took my land. It stretched from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River and the Jordan River. Now give it back peacefully.”
JDG.11.14	 Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of Ammon. 
JDG.11.15	 They said, “This is what Jephthah says: The people of Israel didn’t take away the land belonging to Moab or Ammon. 
JDG.11.16	 When the people of Israel left Egypt, they went through the desert to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. 
JDG.11.17	 The people of Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom. They said, ‘Please let us go through your country.’ But the king of Edom wouldn’t listen to them. They also sent messengers to the king of Moab. But he wouldn’t allow it, either. So the people of Israel remained at Kadesh.
JDG.11.18	 “Then they went through the desert, by-passing Edom and Moab. They camped east of Moab—east of the Arnon River. They did not cross the Arnon River because it was Moab’s border.
JDG.11.19	 “Then the people of Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites. Sihon ruled from Heshbon. The people of Israel said to him, ‘Please let us go through your land to our own.’ 
JDG.11.20	 But Sihon did not trust the Israelites enough to let them go through his territory. Sihon assembled all his troops. He camped at Jahaz and attacked Israel. 
JDG.11.21	 But the L
JDG.11.22	 Israel took all the Amorite territory from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River and from the desert to the Jordan River.
JDG.11.23	 “The L

JDG.11.25	 You’re not any better than Balak, son of King Zippor of Moab, are you? Did he ever have a case against Israel? Or did he ever fight against Israel? 
JDG.11.26	 Israel has now lived in Heshbon, Aroer, all their villages, and in all the cities along the Arnon River for 300 years. Why didn’t you recapture these cities during that time? 
JDG.11.27	 I haven’t sinned against you. But you have done wrong by waging war against me. The L
JDG.11.28	 But the king of Ammon didn’t listen to the message Jephthah sent him.
JDG.11.29	 Then the L
JDG.11.30	 Jephthah made a vow to the L
JDG.11.31	 then whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return safely from Ammon will belong to the L
JDG.11.32	 So Jephthah went to fight against Ammon. The L
JDG.11.33	 He defeated them from Aroer to Minnith and on to Abel Keramim, 20 cities in all. It was a decisive defeat. So the Ammonites were crushed by the people of Israel.
JDG.11.34	 When Jephthah went to his home in Mizpah, he saw his daughter coming out to meet him. She was dancing with tambourines in her hands. She was his only child. Jephthah had no other sons or daughters. 
JDG.11.35	 When he saw her, he tore his clothes in grief and said, “Oh no, Daughter! You’ve brought me to my knees! What disaster you’ve brought me! I made a foolish promise to the L
JDG.11.36	 She said to him, “Father, you made a promise to the L
JDG.11.37	 Then she said to her father, “Do me a favor. Give me two months for my friends and me to walk in the mountains and mourn that I will never have an opportunity to get married.”
JDG.11.38	 “Go!” he said, and he sent her off for two months. She and her friends went to the mountains, and she cried about never being able to get married. 
JDG.11.39	 At the end of those two months she came back to her father. He did to her what he had vowed, and she never had a husband. So the custom began in Israel 
JDG.11.40	 that for four days every year the girls in Israel would go out to sing the praises of the daughter of Jephthah, the man from Gilead.
JDG.12.1	 The men of Ephraim were summoned to fight. They crossed ⌊the Jordan River⌋ to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why did you fight against Ammon without inviting us to go with you? Now we’re going to burn your house down with you in it.”
JDG.12.2	 Jephthah answered, “My people and I were involved in a legal dispute with Ammon. I asked you for help, but you didn’t rescue me from them. 
JDG.12.3	 When I saw that you would not rescue me, I risked my life and went to fight the people of Ammon. The L
JDG.12.4	 Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought Ephraim. The men of Gilead defeated Ephraim. ⌊They did this because⌋ Ephraim had said, “You people from Gilead are nothing but fugitives from Ephraim and Manasseh.”
JDG.12.5	 The men of Gilead captured the shallow crossings of the Jordan River leading back to Ephraim. Whenever a fugitive from Ephraim said, “Let me cross,” the men of Gilead would ask, “Are you from Ephraim?” If he answered, “No,” 
JDG.12.6	 they would tell him, “Say the word 
JDG.12.7	 Jephthah judged Israel for six years. Then Jephthah of Gilead died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
JDG.12.8	 After Jephthah, Ibzan from Bethlehem judged Israel. 
JDG.12.9	 He had 30 sons and 30 daughters. His sons and daughters married people from outside their own families. He judged Israel for seven years. 
JDG.12.10	 When Ibzan died, he was buried in Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	 After Ibzan, Elon from the tribe of Zebulun judged Israel. He judged Israel for ten years. 
JDG.12.12	 When Elon died, he was buried in Aijalon in the territory of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	 After Elon, Abdon, son of Hillel, from Pirathon judged Israel. 
JDG.12.14	 He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons who rode on 70 donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years. 
JDG.12.15	 When Abdon died, he was buried in Pirathon, in the territory of Ephraim, in the mountains of Amalek.
JDG.13.1	 The people of Israel again did what the L
JDG.13.2	 There was a man from Zorah named Manoah. Manoah was from the family of Dan. His wife was not able to have children. 
JDG.13.3	 The Messenger of the L
JDG.13.4	 Now you must be careful. Don’t drink any wine or liquor or eat any unclean 
JDG.13.5	 You’re going to become pregnant and have a son. You must never cut his hair because the boy will be a Nazirite dedicated to God from birth. He will begin to rescue Israel from the power of the Philistines.”
JDG.13.6	 The woman went to tell her husband. She said, “A man of God came to me. He had a very frightening appearance like the Messenger of God. So I didn’t ask him where he came from, and he didn’t tell me his name. 
JDG.13.7	 He told me, ‘You’re going to become pregnant and have a son. So don’t drink any wine or liquor or eat any unclean food because the boy will be a Nazirite dedicated to God from the time he is born until he dies.’ ”
JDG.13.8	 Then Manoah pleaded with the L
JDG.13.9	 God did what Manoah asked. The Messenger of God came back to his wife while she was sitting out in the fields. But her husband Manoah was not with her. 
JDG.13.10	 The woman ran quickly to tell her husband. She said, “The man who came to me the other day has just appeared to me ⌊again⌋.”
JDG.13.11	 Manoah immediately followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked him, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?”
JDG.13.11	“Yes,” he answered.
JDG.13.12	 Then Manoah asked, “When your words come true, how should the boy live and what should he do?”
JDG.13.13	 The Messenger of the L
JDG.13.14	 She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevines, drink any wine or liquor, or eat any unclean food. She must be careful to do everything I commanded.”
JDG.13.15	 Manoah said to the Messenger of the L
JDG.13.16	 But the Messenger of the L
JDG.13.17	 Then Manoah asked the Messenger of the L
JDG.13.18	 The Messenger of the L
JDG.13.19	 So Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and sacrificed them to the L
JDG.13.20	 As the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the Messenger of the L
JDG.13.21	 The Messenger of the L
JDG.13.22	 So Manoah said to his wife, “We will certainly die because we have seen God.”
JDG.13.23	 But Manoah’s wife replied, “If the L
JDG.13.24	 So the woman had a son and named him Samson. The boy grew up, and the L
JDG.13.25	 The L
JDG.14.1	 When Samson went to Timnah, he saw a young Philistine woman. 
JDG.14.2	 He went ⌊home⌋ and told his father and mother, “I’ve seen a Philistine woman at Timnah. Now get her for me so that I can marry her.”
JDG.14.3	 His father and mother asked him, “Aren’t there any women among our relatives or all our people? Do you have to marry a woman from those godless Philistines?”
JDG.14.3	But Samson told his father, “Get her for me! She’s the one I want!” 
JDG.14.4	 His father and mother didn’t know that the L
JDG.14.5	 Samson went with his father and mother to Timnah. When they were coming to the vineyards of Timnah, a young roaring lion met Samson. 
JDG.14.6	 The L
JDG.14.7	 Then he went to talk to the young woman. She was the one he wanted. 
JDG.14.8	 Later he went back to marry her. ⌊On his way⌋ he left the road to look at the lion he had killed. He saw a swarm of bees and some honey in the lion’s dead body. 
JDG.14.9	 He scraped ⌊the honey⌋ into his hands and ate it as he walked along. When he came to his father and mother, he gave them some of the honey to eat. He didn’t tell them he had scraped it out of the lion’s dead body.
JDG.14.10	 After his father went to see the woman, Samson threw a party. (This is what young men used to do.) 
JDG.14.11	 When ⌊her family⌋ saw him, they chose 30 of their friends to be with him.
JDG.14.12	 Then Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle. If you solve it during the seven days of the party, I’ll give you 30 linen shirts and 30 changes of clothes. 
JDG.14.13	 But if you can’t solve it, you will give me the same things.”
JDG.14.13	They responded, “Tell us your riddle! Let’s hear it!”
JDG.14.14	 So Samson said to them,
JDG.14.14	“From the eater
JDG.14.14	came something to eat.
JDG.14.14	From the strong one
JDG.14.14	came something sweet.”
JDG.14.14	For three days they couldn’t solve the riddle. 
JDG.14.15	 On the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, “Trick your husband into solving the riddle for us. If you don’t, we’ll burn you and your family to death. Did the two of you invite us ⌊just to make us poor⌋?”
JDG.14.16	 So Samson’s wife cried on his shoulder. She said, “You hate me! You don’t really love me! You gave my friends a riddle and didn’t tell me the answer.”
JDG.14.16	Samson replied, “I haven’t even told my father and mother, so why should I tell you?”
JDG.14.17	 But she cried on his shoulder for the rest of the seven days of the party. Finally, on the seventh day he told her the answer because she made his life miserable. Then she told her friends the answer to the riddle.
JDG.14.18	 So before sundown on the seventh day, the men of the city said to him,
JDG.14.18	“What is sweeter than honey?
JDG.14.18	What is stronger than a lion?”
JDG.14.18	Samson replied,
JDG.14.18	“If you hadn’t used my cow to plow,
JDG.14.18	you wouldn’t know my riddle now.”
JDG.14.19	 When the L
JDG.14.20	 Samson’s wife was given to his best man.
JDG.15.1	 Later, during the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife. He took a young goat along for her. He said, “I’m going to sleep with my wife in her bedroom.”
JDG.15.1	But her father would not let him go in. 
JDG.15.2	 Her father said, “I thought you hated her. So I gave her to your best man. Isn’t her younger sister better looking? Marry her instead!”
JDG.15.3	 Samson said to him, “This time I won’t be guilty when I get even with the Philistines, even though I’m going to do something terrible to them.” 
JDG.15.4	 So Samson caught 300 foxes. He tied them together in pairs by their tails. Then he fastened a torch between their tails. 
JDG.15.5	 He set the torches on fire and released the foxes in the Philistines’ grain fields. So he set fire to all their grain, whether it was stacked or in the fields. Their olive orchards also caught on fire.
JDG.15.6	 Some Philistines asked, “Who did this?”
JDG.15.6	They were told, “Samson! He’s the son-in-law of the man at Timnah. Samson did it because the man at Timnah took Samson’s wife and gave her to his best man.” So the Philistines burned Samson’s wife and her father to death.
JDG.15.7	 Samson said to them, “If that’s how you’re going to act, I’ll get even with you before I stop.” 
JDG.15.8	 So he attacked them violently and slaughtered them. Then he went to live in a cave in the cliff at Etam.
JDG.15.9	 The Philistines came, camped in Judah, and overran Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	 The men of Judah asked, “Why did you come to fight us?”
JDG.15.10	The Philistines answered, “We’ve come to tie up Samson and do to him what he did to us.”
JDG.15.11	 So 3,000 men from Judah went to the cave in the cliff at Etam. They said to Samson, “Don’t you know that the Philistines rule us? Why have you done this to us?”
JDG.15.11	Samson replied, “I did to them what they did to me.”
JDG.15.12	 So the men from Judah told him, “We’ve come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.”
JDG.15.12	Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you won’t harm me yourselves.”
JDG.15.13	 They told him, “We promise we’ll only tie you up and hand you over to them. We certainly won’t kill you.” So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him back from the cliff.
JDG.15.14	 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines met him with shouts ⌊of triumph⌋. But the L
JDG.15.15	 Samson found the jawbone from a donkey that had just died. He picked it up and killed 1,000 men with it. 
JDG.15.16	 Then Samson said,
JDG.15.16	“With a jawbone from a donkey,
JDG.15.16	I’ve made two piles of them.
JDG.15.16	With a jawbone from a donkey,
JDG.15.16	I’ve killed a thousand men.”
JDG.15.17	 When he finished saying this, he threw the jawbone away. He called that place Ramath Lehi [Jawbone Hill].
JDG.15.18	 Samson was very thirsty. So he called out to the L
JDG.15.19	 So God split open the hollow place at Lehi, and water gushed out. Samson drank some water. Then he was refreshed and revived. So he called the place En Hakkore [Spring of the One Who Calls Out]. It is still there at Lehi today.
JDG.15.20	 Samson judged Israel for 20 years during the time of the Philistines.
JDG.16.1	 Samson went to Gaza. There he saw a prostitute and slept with her. 
JDG.16.2	 The people of Gaza were told, “Samson’s here!” So they surrounded the place and waited all night at the city gate to ambush him. They were quiet all night. They thought, “We’ll kill him at dawn.”
JDG.16.3	 But Samson was in bed ⌊with the prostitute⌋ only until midnight. Then he got up, took hold of the doors, door posts, and bar of the city gate and pulled them out. He carried them on his shoulders to the top of the hill facing Hebron.
JDG.16.4	 After ⌊leaving Gaza⌋, he fell in love with a woman in the Sorek Valley. Her name was Delilah. 
JDG.16.5	 The Philistine rulers came to her and said, “Trick him, and find out what makes him so strong. Find out how we can overpower him. We want to tie him up in order to torture him. Each of us will give you 1,100 pieces of silver.”
JDG.16.6	 So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me what makes you so strong. How can you be tied up so that someone could torture you?”
JDG.16.7	 Samson told her, “If someone ties me up with seven new bowstrings that are not dried out, I will be like any other man.”
JDG.16.8	 The Philistine rulers brought her seven new bowstrings that were not dried out. She tied Samson up with them. 
JDG.16.9	 Some men were hiding in the bedroom waiting for her ⌊to tie him up⌋. Then she said to him, “Samson, the Philistines are attacking!” Samson snapped the bowstrings as a thread snaps when it touches fire. So no one found out why he was so strong.
JDG.16.10	 Delilah told Samson, “Look, you’re making fun of me by telling me lies. Now, tell me how you can be tied up.”
JDG.16.11	 Samson told her, “If someone ties me up tightly with new ropes that have never been used, I will be like any other man.”
JDG.16.12	 So Delilah took some new ropes and tied him up with them. Then she said to him, “Samson, the Philistines are attacking!” Some men were in her bedroom waiting to ambush him. But Samson tore the ropes off his arms as though they were strings.
JDG.16.13	 Delilah told Samson, “You’re still making fun of me by telling me lies. Tell me how you can be tied up.”
JDG.16.13	Samson replied, “Just weave the seven braids of my hair with the other threads in the loom.”
JDG.16.14	 So Delilah tied his braids to the loom shuttle. Then she said to him, “Samson, the Philistines are attacking!” But Samson woke up and tore his braids and the threads out of the loom shuttle.
JDG.16.15	 Delilah said to Samson, “How can you say that you love me when your heart isn’t mine? You’ve made fun of me three times now, but you still haven’t told me what makes you so strong.”
JDG.16.16	 Every day she made his life miserable with her questions. She pestered him until he wished he were dead. 
JDG.16.17	 Finally, he told her the truth. He told her, “Because I’m a Nazirite, no one has ever cut the hair on my head. I was dedicated to God before I was born. If my hair is ever shaved off, my strength will leave me. Then I’ll be like any other man.”
JDG.16.18	 When Delilah realized that he had told her everything, she sent a message to the Philistine rulers, “Come here once more.” (She did this because Samson had told her everything.) So the Philistine rulers arrived with the money in their hands.
JDG.16.19	 Delilah put Samson to sleep on her lap. She called for a man to shave off his seven braids. Then she began to torture him because his strength had left him. 
JDG.16.20	 She said, “Samson, the Philistines are attacking!” Samson woke up. He thought, “I’ll get out of this as usual and shake myself free.” (He didn’t realize that the L
JDG.16.21	 The Philistines grabbed him. They poked out his eyes and took him to the prison in Gaza. They tied him up with double chains and made him grind grain in the mill there.
JDG.16.22	 But his hair started to grow back as soon as it was shaved off.
JDG.16.23	 Now, the Philistine rulers gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon and to celebrate. They said, “Our god handed Samson, our enemy, over to us.” 
JDG.16.24	 When the people saw him, they praised their god. They said,
JDG.16.24	“Our god gave our enemy,
JDG.16.24	destroyer of our land
JDG.16.24	and killer of so many,
JDG.16.24	into our very hand!”
JDG.16.25	 When all the Philistines were enjoying themselves, they said, “Call Samson in to entertain us.”
JDG.16.25	Samson was called from the prison, and he made them laugh. They made him stand between two columns. 
JDG.16.26	 Samson told the young man who was leading him by the hand, “Let me rest. Let me touch the columns on which the building stands so that I can lean against them.” 
JDG.16.27	 The building was filled with people. All the Philistine rulers were there. On the roof there were about three thousand men and women who watched Samson entertain them.
JDG.16.28	 Then Samson called to the L
JDG.16.29	 Samson felt the two middle columns on which the building stood. With his right hand on one column and his left on the other, he pushed hard against them. 
JDG.16.30	 “Let me die with the Philistines,” he said. With that, he pushed with all his might, and the building fell on the rulers and everyone in it. So he killed more Philistines when he died than he had when he was alive.
JDG.16.31	 Then his relatives and his father’s whole family went to Gaza. They took Samson and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah.
JDG.16.31	Samson had judged Israel for 20 years.
JDG.17.1	 There was a man named Micah from the mountain region of Ephraim. 
JDG.17.2	 He told his mother, “You were upset about the 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you. I even heard you put a curse on them. Here’s the silver. I took it!”
JDG.17.2	His mother said, “The L
JDG.17.3	 So Micah gave the 1,100 pieces of silver back to his mother. Then his mother said, “I dedicate this silver to the L
JDG.17.4	 When Micah returned the silver to his mother, she took 200 pieces of the silver and gave it to a silversmith. He made a carved idol and a metal idol. Both were placed in Micah’s home. 
JDG.17.5	 Micah owned a shrine. He also made an ephod 
JDG.17.6	 In those days Israel didn’t have a king. Everyone did whatever he considered right.
JDG.17.7	 There was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah. (Bethlehem belongs to the family of Judah.) He was a Levite but was living in Bethlehem. 
JDG.17.8	 This man left Bethlehem in Judah to live wherever he could find ⌊a place⌋. He came to Micah’s house in the mountains of Ephraim to carry on his work.
JDG.17.9	 Micah asked him, “Where do you come from?”
JDG.17.9	The man told him, “I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I’m going to live wherever I can find ⌊a place⌋.”
JDG.17.10	 Micah told him, “Stay with me! Be a father and a priest to me. I’ll give you ten pieces of silver a year, a set of clothes, and your room and board.”
JDG.17.10	The Levite accepted the offer 
JDG.17.11	 and agreed to live with Micah. The young man became like one of Micah’s sons. 
JDG.17.12	 Micah ordained the Levite. So the young man became his priest and a part of his family.
JDG.17.13	 Then Micah said, “Now I know that the L
JDG.18.1	 In those days Israel didn’t have a king. And in those days the tribe of Dan was looking for a place to live. Up to that time they had not received land as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel as they should have. 
JDG.18.2	 So all the families of Dan sent out five qualified men from Zorah and Eshtaol. They were sent to spy throughout the land and explore it. They were told, “Go and explore the land!”
JDG.18.2	They came to Micah’s house in the mountains of Ephraim. They spent the night there. 
JDG.18.3	 While they were at Micah’s house, they recognized the young Levite’s voice. So they stopped to ask him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing here? Why are you here?”
JDG.18.4	 The Levite told them what Micah had done for him and added, “Micah hired me, so I became his priest.”
JDG.18.5	 They said to him, “Please find out from God if our journey will be successful.”
JDG.18.6	 The priest told them, “Go in peace. The L
JDG.18.7	 The five men left there and came to the city of Laish. They saw that the people there lived without a care. These people were like the people of Sidon. They were peaceful and secure. There was no one around who threatened to take away their property by force. They were far from the people of Sidon and totally independent.
JDG.18.8	 The men went back to their relatives in Zorah and Eshtaol. Their relatives asked them, “What did you find?”
JDG.18.9	 They replied, “Get up, let’s attack Laish. We saw the land. It’s very good!
JDG.18.9	“Don’t just sit there! Go at once and take the land. 
JDG.18.10	 When you get there, you will come to a secure people. The land is wide open to you. God will hand it over to you. It’s a place where you will have everything you could want.”
JDG.18.11	 So 600 men from the tribe of Dan left Zorah and Eshtaol armed for war. 
JDG.18.12	 They camped at Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place just west of Kiriath Jearim is still called Mahaneh Dan [The Camp of Dan] today. 
JDG.18.13	 From there they marched to the mountains of Ephraim as far as Micah’s house. 
JDG.18.14	 Then the five men who had gone to spy throughout the land around Laish spoke up. They said to the other men of Dan, “Do you know that there’s an ephod, a carved idol, a metal idol, and household idols in these houses? What do you think we should do?”
JDG.18.15	 So they stopped and entered Micah’s house and greeted the young Levite. 
JDG.18.16	 The 600 armed men from Dan stood at the entrance to the city. 
JDG.18.17	 The five men who had gone to spy throughout the land went inside. They took the carved idol, the ephod, the household idols, and the metal idol. The priest stood at the entrance to the city with the 600 armed men. 
JDG.18.18	 When these men entered Micah’s house and took the carved idol, the ephod, the household idols, and the metal idol, the priest asked them, “What are you doing?”
JDG.18.19	 They told him, “Keep quiet! Don’t say a word! Come with us and be our father and priest. Is it better for you to be a priest for one man’s house or for a tribe in Israel and its families?”
JDG.18.20	 The priest was content. He took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved idol and went with the people. 
JDG.18.21	 When they left, they put their children, livestock, and property in front of them.
JDG.18.22	 When they had already gone some distance from Micah’s house, Micah’s neighbors were called together to help him catch up to the people of Dan. 
JDG.18.23	 They shouted at them. But the people of Dan turned around and said to Micah, “What’s your problem? Why did you call your neighbors together to attack us?”
JDG.18.24	 Micah answered, “You’ve taken away the gods I made as well as my priest. What do I have left? How can you say to me, ‘What’s your problem?’ ”
JDG.18.25	 The people of Dan replied, “Don’t make another sound, or some violent men will attack you. Then you and your family will lose your lives.” 
JDG.18.26	 The people of Dan went on their way. Micah saw they were stronger than he was, so he turned around and went home.
JDG.18.27	 The people of Dan took what Micah had made and the man who had become his priest and went to the city of Laish. They attacked a peaceful and secure people, killed them all with swords, and burned their city. 
JDG.18.28	 There was no one to rescue them because their city was far from Sidon and totally independent. The city was in the valley that belonged to Beth Rehob. The people of Dan rebuilt the city and lived in it. 
JDG.18.29	 They named the city Dan in honor of their ancestor Dan, Israel’s son. Originally, the city was called Laish.
JDG.18.30	 The people of Dan set up the carved idol for themselves. Jonathan (son of Gershom and grandson of Moses) and his descendants were priests for Dan’s tribe until the people living in that land were taken captive. 
JDG.18.31	 So they set up for themselves the carved idol Micah had made. It stayed there the whole time the house of God was at Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	 In those days when Israel didn’t have a king, there was a Levite who lived in a remote area in the mountains of Ephraim. He took a woman from Bethlehem in Judah to be his concubine.
JDG.19.2	 But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went to her father’s home, to Bethlehem in Judah. When she had been there four months, 
JDG.19.3	 her husband went to persuade her to come back home. He took along his servant and two donkeys.
JDG.19.3	She took her husband into her father’s house. Her father was thrilled to see him. 
JDG.19.4	 He made the Levite stay there with him, celebrating for three days.
JDG.19.5	 On the fourth day they got up early in the morning to leave, but the woman’s father told his son-in-law, “Eat something to keep up your strength and then you can go.” 
JDG.19.6	 So they both sat down and ate and drank together. The woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Why don’t you spend the night and enjoy yourself?” 
JDG.19.7	 When the Levite started to leave, his father-in-law urged him to stay another night, so he did.
JDG.19.8	 On the morning of the fifth day, the Levite got up early to leave. The woman’s father said, “Eat something to keep up your strength!” So they spent the time eating until late afternoon. 
JDG.19.9	 The Levite started to leave with his concubine and his servant. But his father-in-law said to him, “It’s already evening. Please stay another night. It’s too late ⌊to leave⌋ now. Stay here, and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow you can start out early to go home.” 
JDG.19.10	 But the Levite refused to spend another night.
JDG.19.10	He left and traveled as far as Jebus (now called Jerusalem). He had with him two saddled donkeys and his concubine. 
JDG.19.11	 By the time they were near Jebus, it was very late in the day. The Levite’s servant said to him, “Let’s go spend the night in Jebus.”
JDG.19.12	 The Levite told him, “We’ll never go into a city of foreigners. They’re not Israelites. We’ll go on to Gibeah.” 
JDG.19.13	 He told his servant, “Let’s go someplace else. We’ll spend the night either at Gibeah or Ramah.”
JDG.19.14	 So they went on. It was sunset by the time they arrived at Gibeah. (Gibeah belonged to the tribe of Benjamin.) 
JDG.19.15	 They went to spend the night there. The Levite entered Gibeah and sat down in the city square, because no one offered to take them home for the night.
JDG.19.16	 That evening an old man came into the city from his work in the fields. He was from the mountain region of Ephraim but lived in Gibeah. The other people who lived there were from the tribe of Benjamin. 
JDG.19.17	 He saw the traveler in the city square. So the old man asked, “Where do you come from? And where are you going?”
JDG.19.18	 The Levite replied, “We’re on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the mountains of Ephraim. That’s where I’m from. I had gone to Bethlehem in Judah. Now I’m going to the L
JDG.19.19	 We have straw and fodder for our donkeys. I even have bread and wine for myself, the woman, and my servant. We have everything we need.”
JDG.19.20	 Then the old man said, “Welcome! Let me take care of your needs. Just don’t spend the night in the city square.” 
JDG.19.21	 So he took the Levite to his house and fed the donkeys. After they washed, they ate and drank.
JDG.19.22	 While they were enjoying themselves, some worthless men from the city surrounded the house and pounded on the door. They told the old man, the owner of the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house so that we can have sex with him.”
JDG.19.23	 The owner went out to them. He told them, “No, my friends! Please don’t do anything so evil! This man is a guest in my home. Don’t do such a godless thing! 
JDG.19.24	 Here, let me bring out my virgin daughter and this man’s concubine. Rape them, and do with them whatever you want. Just don’t do such a godless thing to this man.”
JDG.19.25	 But the men refused to listen to him. So the Levite grabbed his concubine and forced her outside. They had sex with her and abused her all night until morning. They let her go when the sun was coming up. 
JDG.19.26	 At daybreak, the woman came to the door of the house where her husband was and collapsed. She was still there when it became light.
JDG.19.27	 Her husband got up in the morning, opened the doors of the house, and was about to leave. His wife (that is, his concubine) was lying at the door of the house with her hands on the doorstep. 
JDG.19.28	 The Levite said to her, “Get up! Let’s go!” But she did not answer. So he put her on the donkey and left for home.
JDG.19.29	 When he arrived home, he got a knife. He took his concubine and cut her limb from limb into 12 pieces. Then he sent the pieces throughout the territories of Israel.
JDG.19.30	 Everyone who saw it said, “Never has such a thing happened or been seen from the time the people of Israel came out of Egypt until today. Think about it! Form a plan, and speak out!”
JDG.20.1	 All the people of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and from Gilead came to Mizpah. The congregation stood united in the presence of the L
JDG.20.2	 The leaders of all Israel’s tribes took their places in the congregation of God’s people. There were 400,000 foot soldiers with swords. 
JDG.20.3	 The people of Benjamin heard that Israel had come to Mizpah.
JDG.20.3	The people of Israel said, “Tell us how such an evil thing could happen.”
JDG.20.4	 The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered, “My concubine 
JDG.20.5	 The citizens of Gibeah came to attack me. They surrounded the house ⌊where I was staying⌋ that night. They intended to kill me, but instead, they raped my concubine until she died. 
JDG.20.6	 So I took my concubine and cut her into pieces. Then I sent the pieces throughout the territory of Israel. I did this because the citizens of Gibeah did this perverted and godless thing in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	 All you people of Israel, tell me what you think. Give me your advice right now!”
JDG.20.8	 All the people stood united, saying, “None of us will go to his tent or return to his house. 
JDG.20.9	 This is what we’ll do to Gibeah. We’ll decide by lot who should attack it.
JDG.20.10	 We’ll take one-tenth 
JDG.20.11	 So all the men of Israel assembled. They stood united against the city.
JDG.20.12	 The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin. They asked, “How could such an evil thing happen among you? 
JDG.20.13	 Now hand over those worthless men in Gibeah. We must put them to death to rid ourselves of this kind of evil in Israel.”
JDG.20.13	But the men of Benjamin refused to listen to the men of Israel. 
JDG.20.14	 So the men of Benjamin went from their towns and assembled at Gibeah to go to war with the men of Israel. 
JDG.20.15	 That day 26,000 men armed with swords came from Benjamin’s cities and organized for battle along with 700 of Gibeah’s best men. 
JDG.20.16	 Out of all these troops, the best 700 were left-handed. Each could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
JDG.20.17	 The men of Israel (Benjamin not included) totaled 400,000 soldiers armed with swords.
JDG.20.18	 The men of Israel went to Bethel. They asked God, “Who will go first to fight Benjamin?”
JDG.20.18	The L
JDG.20.19	 The Israelites got up early in the morning and camped at Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	 So the men of Israel went to war with the men of Benjamin. The Israelites formed their battle line facing Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	 That day the men of Benjamin came out from Gibeah. They slaughtered 22,000 of Israel’s men.
JDG.20.22	 But Israel’s troops got reinforcements. They formed their battle line where they had formed it on the first day. 
JDG.20.23	 The Israelites went and cried in the presence of the L
JDG.20.23	The L
JDG.20.24	 On the second day the Israelite troops advanced against Benjamin. 
JDG.20.25	 Benjamin went out from Gibeah to meet them. This time they slaughtered 18,000 men from Israel who were armed with swords. 
JDG.20.26	 Then all the men of Israel and all the troops went to Bethel. They sat there and cried in the presence of the L
JDG.20.27	 In those days the ark of God’s promise was at Bethel. 
JDG.20.28	 (Phinehas, son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, served in front of it.) So the people of Israel asked the L
JDG.20.28	The L
JDG.20.29	 Then Israel placed troops in ambush around Gibeah. 
JDG.20.30	 On the third day the men of Israel went to fight the men of Benjamin. They formed their battle line facing Gibeah as they did before. 
JDG.20.31	 The men of Benjamin went out to attack Israel’s troops and were led away from the city. They started to inflict casualties as before. They killed about 30 men from Israel in the open country and on the roads to Bethel and Gibeah. 
JDG.20.32	 The men of Benjamin shouted, “They’re defeated as before!”
JDG.20.32	But the men of Israel had said, “Let’s flee in order to lead them from the city to the roads.” 
JDG.20.33	 So the men of Israel left their positions. They formed their battle line at Baal Tamar. Meanwhile, those waiting in ambush rushed from their position to the west of Gibeah. 
JDG.20.34	 Then 10,000 of Israel’s best men attacked Gibeah. The battle was fierce. But Benjamin’s men didn’t realize their own evil was about to overtake them. 
JDG.20.35	 So the L
JDG.20.36	 Then the men of Benjamin realized they were defeated.
JDG.20.36	The Israelites had allowed the men of Benjamin to take back some ground. The Israelites relied on those waiting in ambush near Gibeah. 
JDG.20.37	 The men in ambush quickly charged toward Gibeah. They spread out in the city and killed everyone. 
JDG.20.38	 The men of Israel had arranged with those waiting in ambush that they would make a big column of smoke rise from the city as a signal. 
JDG.20.39	 Then the men of Israel would turn around in the battle.
JDG.20.39	The men of Benjamin had already killed about 30 men of Israel. They even said, “Israel is completely defeated, just like in the first battle.”
JDG.20.40	 But when the column of smoke started to rise from the city, the men of Benjamin turned around and saw the whole city going up in smoke. 
JDG.20.41	 Then the men of Israel turned around, and the men of Benjamin panicked. They realized that their evil had overtaken them. 
JDG.20.42	 They turned in front of Israel toward the road to the desert. But the battle caught up with the men of Benjamin. Israel slaughtered whoever came out of the cities on the road to the desert. 
JDG.20.43	 They closed in on the men of Benjamin and pursued them without stopping. They overtook them east of Gibeah. 
JDG.20.44	 There were 18,000 experienced men from Benjamin who died in battle. 
JDG.20.45	 The others turned and fled into the desert to Rimmon Rock. But the men of Israel killed 5,000 more on the roads. They caught up with another 2,000 and killed them near Gidom. 
JDG.20.46	 In all, 25,000 men from Benjamin who were armed with swords were killed that day. They were all experienced men.
JDG.20.47	 But 600 men turned and fled into the desert to Rimmon Rock. They stayed at Rimmon Rock for four months.
JDG.20.48	 Then the men of Israel went back to attack the rest of the territory of Benjamin. They killed all the people and cattle they found in every city. They also burned down every city they came to.
JDG.21.1	 The men of Israel had taken this oath in Mizpah: “None of us will ever let our daughters marry anyone from Benjamin.”
JDG.21.2	 The people went to Bethel and sat there in the presence of God until evening. They cried very loudly, 
JDG.21.3	 “L
JDG.21.4	 The next day the people got up early. They built an altar there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. 
JDG.21.5	 The people asked, “Is there any family from Israel that did not take part in the assembly in the presence of the L
JDG.21.6	 The people of Israel felt sorry for their close relatives, the men of Benjamin. They said, “Today one tribe has been excluded from Israel. 
JDG.21.7	 What will we do to provide wives for the men who are left? We swore to the L
JDG.21.8	 Then they asked, “Is there any family from Israel that did not come into the presence of the L
JDG.21.9	 So they questioned the people, and there was no one there from Jabesh Gilead.
JDG.21.10	 The congregation sent 12,000 soldiers. They ordered them, “Go and kill the people of Jabesh Gilead, including the women and children. 
JDG.21.11	 These are your directions: Claim every female who has gone to bed with a man, and claim every male. Claim them for the L
JDG.21.12	 Among the people of Jabesh Gilead they found 400 unmarried women who had never gone to bed with a man. They brought them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.
JDG.21.13	 Then the whole congregation sent messengers to the men of Benjamin at Rimmon Rock and offered them peace. 
JDG.21.14	 So the men of Benjamin came back at that time. These men were given the women from Jabesh Gilead who had been kept alive. However, the congregation had not found enough women for all of them.
JDG.21.15	 The congregation felt sorry for the people of Benjamin because the L
JDG.21.16	 The leaders of the congregation asked, “What should we do to provide wives for the men who are left, since the women in Benjamin have been killed?”
JDG.21.17	 Some said, “Benjamin’s men who survived must be allowed to have families. No tribe of Israel should be wiped out. 
JDG.21.18	 However, we can’t give them any of our daughters as wives. The people of Israel have taken an oath that whoever gives wives to the men of Benjamin is under a curse.”
JDG.21.19	 Others said, “Every year the L
JDG.21.20	 So they told the men of Benjamin, “Hide in the vineyards and 
JDG.21.21	 watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to take part in the dances, come out of the vineyards. Each of you catch a woman from Shiloh to be your wife. Then go back to the territory of Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	 When their fathers or brothers come to us to complain, we’ll tell them, ‘Have pity on them, since we didn’t provide a wife for each man in the battle. You won’t be guilty because you didn’t give them the wives yourselves.’ ”
JDG.21.23	 The men of Benjamin did just that. They captured the number of wives they needed from the women who were dancing and went home. So they rebuilt their cities and lived in them.
JDG.21.24	 At that time the people of Israel left. Each man went to his tribe and family. They all went home.
JDG.21.25	 In those days Israel didn’t have a king. Everyone did whatever he considered right.
RUT.1.1	 In the days when the judges were ruling, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah went with his wife and two sons to live for a while in the country of Moab. 
RUT.1.2	 The man’s name was Elimelech, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of their two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were descendants of Ephrathah from Bethlehem in the territory of Judah. They went to the country of Moab and lived there.
RUT.1.3	 Now, Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, and she was left alone with her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	 Each son married a woman from Moab. One son married a woman named Orpah, and the other son married a woman named Ruth. They lived there for about ten years. 
RUT.1.5	 Then both Mahlon and Chilion died as well. So Naomi was left alone, without her two sons or her husband.
RUT.1.6	 Naomi and her daughters-in-law started on the way back from the country of Moab. (While they were still in Moab she heard that the L
RUT.1.7	 So she left the place where she had been living, and her two daughters-in-law went with her.) They began to walk back along the road to the territory of Judah.
RUT.1.8	 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back! Each of you should go back to your mother’s home. May the L
RUT.1.9	 May the L
RUT.1.9	When she kissed them goodbye, they began to cry loudly. 
RUT.1.10	 They said to her, “We are going back with you to your people.”
RUT.1.11	 But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Do I have any more sons in my womb who could be your husbands? 
RUT.1.12	 Go back, my daughters. Go, because I am too old to get married again. If I said that I still have hope. . . . And if I had a husband tonight. . . . And even if I gave birth to sons, 
RUT.1.13	 would you wait until they grew up and stay single just for them? No, my daughters. My bitterness is much worse than yours because the L
RUT.1.14	 They began to cry loudly again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth held on to her tightly. 
RUT.1.15	 Naomi said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods. Go back with your sister-in-law.”
RUT.1.16	 But Ruth answered, “Don’t force me to leave you. Don’t make me turn back from following you. Wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. 
RUT.1.17	 Wherever you die, I will die, and I will be buried there with you. May the L
RUT.1.18	 When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ended the conversation.
RUT.1.19	 So both of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was excited about them. “This can’t be Naomi, can it?” the women asked.
RUT.1.20	 She answered them, “Don’t call me Naomi [Sweet]. Call me Mara [Bitter] because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. 
RUT.1.21	 I went away full, but the L
RUT.1.22	 When Naomi came back from the country of Moab, Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, came along with her. They happened to enter Bethlehem just when the barley harvest began.
RUT.2.1	 Naomi had a relative. He was from Elimelech’s side of the family. He was a man of outstanding character named Boaz.
RUT.2.2	 Ruth, who was from Moab, said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field of anyone who will be kind to me. There I will gather the grain left behind by the reapers.”
RUT.2.2	Naomi told her, “Go, my daughter.”
RUT.2.3	 So Ruth went. She entered a field and gathered the grain left behind by the reapers. Now it happened that she ended up in the part of the field that belonged to Boaz, who was from Elimelech’s family.
RUT.2.4	 Just then, Boaz was coming from Bethlehem, and he said to his reapers, “May the L
RUT.2.4	They answered him, “May the L
RUT.2.5	 Boaz asked the young man in charge of his reapers, “Who is this young woman?”
RUT.2.6	 The young man answered, “She’s a young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. 
RUT.2.7	 She said, ‘Please let me gather grain. I will only gather among the bundles behind the reapers.’ So she came here and has been on her feet from daybreak until now. She just sat down this minute in the shelter.”
RUT.2.8	 Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go in any other field to gather grain, and don’t even leave this one. Stay here with my young women. 
RUT.2.9	 Watch where my men are reaping, and follow the young women in that field. I have ordered my young men not to touch you. When you’re thirsty, go to the jars and drink some of the water that the young men have drawn.”
RUT.2.10	 Ruth immediately bowed down to the ground and said to him, “Why are you so helpful? Why are you paying attention to me? I’m only a foreigner.”
RUT.2.11	 Boaz answered her, “People have told me about everything you have done for your mother-in-law after your husband died. They told me how you left your father and mother and the country where you were born. They also told me how you came to people that you didn’t know before. 
RUT.2.12	 May the L
RUT.2.13	 Ruth replied, “Sir, may your kindness to me continue. You have comforted me and reassured me, and I’m not even one of your own servants.”
RUT.2.14	 When it was time to eat, Boaz told her, “Come here. Have some bread, and dip it into the sour wine.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he handed her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.
RUT.2.15	 When she got up to gather grain, Boaz ordered his servants, “Let her gather grain even among the bundles. Don’t give her any problems. 
RUT.2.16	 Even pull some grain out of the bundles and leave it for her to gather. Don’t give her a hard time about it.”
RUT.2.17	 So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening. Then she separated the grain from its husks. She had about half a bushel of barley. 
RUT.2.18	 She picked it up and went into the town, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gathered. Ruth also took out what she had left over from lunch and gave it to Naomi.
RUT.2.19	 Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you gather grain today? Just where did you work? May the man who paid attention to you be blessed.”
RUT.2.19	So Ruth told her mother-in-law about the person with whom she worked. She said, “The man I worked with today is named Boaz.”
RUT.2.20	 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May the L
RUT.2.21	 Ruth, who was from Moab, told her, “He also said to me, ‘Stay with my younger workers until they have finished the harvest.’ ”
RUT.2.22	 Naomi told her daughter-in-law Ruth, “It’s a good idea, my daughter, that you go out to the fields with his young women. If you go to someone else’s field, you may be molested.”
RUT.2.23	 So Ruth stayed with the young women who were working for Boaz. She gathered grain until both the barley harvest and the wheat harvest ended. And she continued to live with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	 Naomi, Ruth’s mother-in-law, said to her, “My daughter, shouldn’t I try to look for a home that would be good for you? 
RUT.3.2	 Isn’t Boaz, whose young women you’ve been working with, our relative? He will be separating the barley from its husks on the threshing floor 
RUT.3.3	 Freshen up, put on some perfume, dress up, and go down to the threshing floor. Don’t let him know that you’re there until he’s finished eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	 When he lies down, notice the place where he is lying. Then uncover his feet, and lie down there. He will make it clear what you must do.”
RUT.3.5	 Ruth answered her, “I will do whatever you say.”
RUT.3.6	 Ruth went to the threshing floor and did exactly as her mother-in-law had directed her. 
RUT.3.7	 Boaz had eaten and drunk to his heart’s content, so he went and lay at the edge of a pile of grain. Then she went over to him secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.
RUT.3.8	 At midnight the man was shivering. When he turned over, he was surprised to see a woman lying at his feet. 
RUT.3.9	 “Who are you?” he asked.
RUT.3.9	She answered, “I am Ruth. Spread the corner of your garment over me because you are a close relative who can take care of me.”
RUT.3.10	 Boaz replied, “May the L
RUT.3.11	 Don’t be afraid, my daughter. I will do whatever you say. The whole town knows that you are a woman who has strength of character. 
RUT.3.12	 It is true that I am a close relative of yours, but there is a relative closer than I. 
RUT.3.13	 Stay here tonight. In the morning if he will agree to take care of you, that is good. He can take care of you. But if he does not wish to take care of you, then, I solemnly swear, as the L
RUT.3.14	 So Ruth lay at his feet until morning. Then she got up early before anyone could be recognized. At that moment Boaz thought to himself, “I hope that no one will ever know that this woman came to the threshing floor.”
RUT.3.15	 Then Boaz told Ruth, “Stretch out the cape you’re wearing and hold it tight.” So she held it tight while he measured out six measures of barley. Then he placed it on her ⌊back⌋ and went into the town.
RUT.3.16	 When Ruth returned, her mother-in-law Naomi asked, “How did things go, my daughter?”
RUT.3.16	Ruth told Naomi everything the man had done for her. 
RUT.3.17	 She said, “He gave me these six measures of barley and told me not to come back to you empty-handed.”
RUT.3.18	 Naomi replied, “Stay here, my daughter, until you know how it turns out. The man won’t rest unless he settles this matter today.”
RUT.4.1	 Boaz went to the city gate and sat there. Just then, the relative about whom he had spoken was passing by. Boaz said, “Please come over here and sit, my friend.” So the man came over and sat down.
RUT.4.2	 Then Boaz chose ten men who were leaders of that city and said, “Sit here.” So they also sat down.
RUT.4.3	 Boaz said to the man, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the field that belonged to our relative Elimelech. 
RUT.4.4	 So I said that I would inform you. Buy it in the presence of these men sitting here and in the presence of the leaders of our people. If you wish to buy back the property, you can buy back the property. But if you do not wish to buy back the property, tell me. Then I will know that I am next in line because there is no other relative except me.”
RUT.4.4	The man said, “I’ll buy back the property.”
RUT.4.5	 Boaz continued, “When you buy the field from Naomi, you will also assume responsibility for the Moabite Ruth, the dead man’s widow. This keeps the inheritance in the dead man’s name.”
RUT.4.6	 The man replied, “In that case I cannot assume responsibility for her. If I did, I would ruin my inheritance. Take all my rights to buy back the property for yourself, because I cannot assume that responsibility.”
RUT.4.7	 (This is the way it used to be in Israel concerning buying back property and exchanging goods: In order to make every matter legal, a man would take off his sandal and give it to the other man. This was the way a contract was publicly approved in Israel.) 
RUT.4.8	 So when the man said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” he took off his sandal.
RUT.4.9	 Then Boaz said to the leaders and to all the people, “Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	 In addition, I have bought as my wife the Moabite Ruth, Mahlon’s widow, to keep the inheritance in the dead man’s name. In this way the dead man’s name will not be cut off from his relatives or from the public records. Today you are witnesses.”
RUT.4.11	 All the people who were at the gate, including the leaders, said, “We are witnesses. May the L
RUT.4.12	 Also, from the descendant whom the L
RUT.4.13	 Then Boaz took Ruth home, and she became his wife. He slept with her, and the L
RUT.4.14	 The women said to Naomi, “Praise the L
RUT.4.15	 He will bring you a new life and support you in your old age. Your daughter-in-law who loves you is better to you than seven sons, because she has given birth.”
RUT.4.16	 Naomi took the child, held him on her lap, and became his guardian.
RUT.4.17	 The women in the neighborhood said, “Naomi has a son.” So they gave him the name Obed.
RUT.4.17	He became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.
RUT.4.18	 This is the account of Perez and his family.
RUT.4.18	Perez was the father of Hezron.
RUT.4.19	 Hezron was the father of Ram.
RUT.4.19	Ram was the father of Amminadab.
RUT.4.20	 Amminadab was the father of Nahshon.
RUT.4.20	Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
RUT.4.21	 Salmon was the father of Boaz.
RUT.4.21	Boaz was the father of Obed.
RUT.4.22	 Obed was the father of Jesse.
RUT.4.22	Jesse was the father of David.
1SA.1.1	 There was a man named Elkanah from Ramathaim Zophim in the mountains of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, grandson of Elihu, great-grandson of Tohu, whose father was Zuph from the tribe of Ephraim. 
1SA.1.2	 Elkanah had two wives, one named Hannah, the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. 
1SA.1.3	 Every year this man would go from his own city to worship and sacrifice to the L

1SA.1.14	 “How long are you going to stay drunk?” Eli asked her. “Get rid of your wine.”
1SA.1.15	 Hannah responded, “No sir. I’m not drunk. I’m depressed. I’m pouring out my heart to the L

1SA.1.17	 Eli replied, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request.”
1SA.1.18	 “May you continue to be kind to me,” she said. Then the woman went her way and ate. She was no longer sad.

1SA.2.14	 Then he would stick it into the pot, kettle, cauldron, or pan. Whatever the fork brought up ⌊from the pot⌋ belonged to the priest. This is what the priests did in Shiloh to all the people of Israel who came there ⌊to sacrifice⌋. 
1SA.2.15	 But ⌊in the case of Eli’s sons,⌋ even before the people burned the fat, their servants would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the meat to the priest to roast. He doesn’t want boiled meat from you. He wants it raw.”
1SA.2.16	 If the man said to the servant, “First let the fat be burned, then take as much as you want,” the servant would say to him, “Give it to me now, or I’ll take it by force.”

1SA.2.29	 Why do you show no respect for my sacrifices and grain offerings that I have commanded people to make in my dwelling place? Why do you honor your sons more than me by making yourselves fat on the best of all the sacrifices offered by my people Israel?

1SA.4.14	 Hearing the cry, Eli asked, “What is this commotion?” So the man went quickly to tell Eli the news. 
1SA.4.15	 (Eli was 98 years old, and his eyesight had failed so that he couldn’t see.)
1SA.4.16	 The man told Eli, “I’m the one who came from the battle. I fled from the front line today.”
1SA.4.16	“What happened, son?” Eli asked.
1SA.4.17	 “Israel fled from the Philistines,” the messenger answered. “Our troops suffered heavy casualties. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, also are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”
1SA.4.18	 When the messenger mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell from his chair backwards toward the gate. He broke his neck, and he died. (The man was old and heavy.) He had judged 
1SA.4.19	 His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was pregnant. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor prematurely and gave birth to a son. 
1SA.4.20	 As she was dying, the women helping her said, “Don’t be afraid. You’ve given birth to a son.” But she didn’t answer or pay attention.
1SA.4.21	 She called the boy Ichabod [No Glory], saying, “Israel’s glory is gone,” because the ark of God had been captured and because her father-in-law and her husband ⌊died⌋. 
1SA.4.22	 “Israel’s glory is gone because the ark of God has been captured,” she said.
1SA.5.1	 After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	 They brought it into the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	 Early the next day the people of Ashdod saw that Dagon had fallen forward on the ground in front of the L
1SA.5.4	 But the next morning they saw that Dagon had ⌊again⌋ fallen forward on the ground in front of the L
1SA.5.5	 This is why the priests of Dagon and everyone else who comes into Dagon’s temple in Ashdod still don’t step on the temple’s threshold.
1SA.5.6	 The L
1SA.5.7	 When the people of Ashdod realized what was happening, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not stay with us, because their God is dealing harshly with us and our god Dagon.” 
1SA.5.8	 The people of Ashdod called together all the Philistine rulers. “What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” they asked.
1SA.5.8	“The ark of the God of Israel must be taken to Gath,” the rulers said.
1SA.5.9	 But after they had moved it,
1SA.5.10	 So the people of Gath sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They brought the ark of the God of Israel here to kill us.” 
1SA.5.11	 They called together all the Philistine rulers. “Send the ark of the God of Israel away,” they said. “Let it go back to its own place so that it won’t kill us or our people.” There was a fear of death throughout the city, where God dealt ⌊with them⌋ very harshly. 
1SA.5.12	 The people who didn’t die were struck with tumors. So the cry of the city went up to heaven.

1SA.6.2	 when the Philistines called for priests and people skilled in explaining omens. The Philistines asked, “What should we do with the ark of the L
1SA.6.3	 The priests answered, “If you’re returning the ark of the God of Israel, don’t send it away empty, but by all means return it to its ⌊proper⌋ place with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will know why he would not turn his anger away from you.”
1SA.6.4	 The Philistines asked, “What kind of guilt offering should we give him?”
1SA.6.4	The priests answered, “Five gold tumors and five gold mice for the ⌊five⌋ Philistine rulers because all of you and your rulers suffer from the same plague. 
1SA.6.5	 Make models of your tumors and your mice which are destroying the country, and give glory to the God of Israel. Maybe he will no longer be so hard on you, your gods, and your country. 
1SA.6.6	 Why should you be as stubborn as the Egyptians and their Pharaoh were? After he toyed with the Egyptians, didn’t they send the Israelites on their way?

1SA.6.11	 They put the ark of the L
1SA.6.12	 The cows went straight up the road to Beth Shemesh. Continually mooing, they stayed on the road and didn’t turn right or left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth Shemesh.
1SA.6.13	 The people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the ark, they were overjoyed. 
1SA.6.14	 The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stopped there by a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the L

1SA.7.7	 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the Philistine rulers came to attack Israel. The Israelites heard ⌊about the Philistine plan⌋ and were afraid of them. 
1SA.7.8	 The Israelites said to Samuel, “Don’t turn a deaf ear to us! Don’t stop crying to the L

1SA.7.10	 While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines came to fight against Israel. On that day the L
1SA.7.11	 Israel’s soldiers left Mizpah, pursued the Philistines, and killed them as far as Beth Car.

1SA.7.15	 Samuel judged Israel as long as he lived. 
1SA.7.16	 Every year he went around to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah in order to judge Israel in all those places. 
1SA.7.17	 Then he would return home to Ramah. There, too, he judged Israel. And in Ramah he built an altar to the L
1SA.8.1	 When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	 The name of his firstborn son was Joel; the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	 The sons didn’t follow their father’s example but turned to dishonest ways of making money. They took bribes and denied people justice.
1SA.8.4	 Then all the leaders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. 
1SA.8.5	 They told him, “You’re old, and your sons aren’t following your example. Now appoint a king to judge us so that we will be like all the other nations.”
1SA.8.6	 But Samuel considered it wrong for them to request a king to judge them. So Samuel prayed to the L

1SA.8.10	 Then Samuel told the people who had asked him for a king everything the L
1SA.8.11	 Samuel said, “These are the rights of a king:
1SA.8.11	He will draft your sons, make them serve on his chariots and horses, and make them run ahead of his chariots.
1SA.8.12	 He will appoint them to be his officers over 1,000 or over 50 soldiers, to plow his ground and harvest his crops, and to make weapons and equipment for his chariots.
1SA.8.13	 He will take your daughters and have them make perfumes, cook, and bake.
1SA.8.14	 He will take the best of your fields, vineyards, and olive orchards and give them to his officials.
1SA.8.15	 He will take a tenth of your grain and wine and give it to his aids and officials.
1SA.8.16	 He will take your male and female slaves, your best cattle,
1SA.8.17	 He will take a tenth of your flocks.
1SA.8.17	In addition, you will be his servants.
1SA.8.18	 “When that day comes, you will cry out because of the king whom you have chosen for yourselves. The L
1SA.8.19	 But the people refused to listen to Samuel. They said, “No, we want a king! 
1SA.8.20	 Then we, too, will be like all the other nations. Our king will judge us, lead us out ⌊to war⌋, and fight our battles.”
1SA.8.21	 When Samuel heard everything the people had to say, he reported it privately to the L
1SA.8.22	 The L
1SA.8.22	Then Samuel told the people of Israel, “Go ⌊back⌋ to your own cities.”
1SA.9.1	 There was a man from the tribe of Benjamin whose name was Kish. He was a son of Abiel, grandson of Zeror, and great-grandson of Becorath, whose father was Aphiah, a descendant of Benjamin. Kish was a powerful man. 
1SA.9.2	 He had a son named Saul, a handsome, young man. No man in Israel was more handsome than Saul. He stood a head taller than everyone else.
1SA.9.3	 When some donkeys belonging to Saul’s father Kish were lost, Kish told Saul, “Take one of the servants with you, and go look for the donkeys.”
1SA.9.4	 They went through the mountains of Ephraim and the region of Shalisha without finding the donkeys. Then Saul and his servant went through the region of Shaalim, but the donkeys weren’t there. The men went through the territory of Benjamin but ⌊still⌋ didn’t find them. 
1SA.9.5	 When they came to the territory of Zuph, Saul told his servant who was with him, “Let’s go back, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and worry about us ⌊instead⌋.”
1SA.9.6	 The servant responded, “There’s a man of God in this city, a highly respected man. Everything he says is sure to happen. Let’s go there. Maybe he’ll tell us which way we should go.”
1SA.9.7	 “If we go,” Saul asked his servant, “what could we bring the man since the food in our sacks is gone? There’s no present we can bring the man of God. What do we have?”
1SA.9.8	 The servant again answered Saul, “Look, here! I have one-tenth of an ounce of silver. I’ll give it to the man of God. Then he’ll tell us where to find the donkeys.”
1SA.9.9	 (Formerly in Israel, when a person went to ask God ⌊a question⌋, he would say, “Come, let’s go to the seer,” because a person we now call a prophet used to be called a seer.)
1SA.9.10	 Saul told his servant, “That’s a good idea! Come on, let’s go.” They went to the city where the man of God was.
1SA.9.11	 As they were going up the hill to the city, they met girls coming out to get water. They asked the girls, “Is the seer here?”
1SA.9.12	 The girls answered, “He’s there ahead of you. Hurry! He ⌊just⌋ went into the city today since the people are offering a sacrifice on the worship site. 
1SA.9.13	 As you go into the city, you can find him before he goes to the worship site to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, since he blesses the sacrifice. Then those who are invited may eat. Go. You should be able to find him now.”
1SA.9.14	 So Saul and his servant went to the city. As they entered it, Samuel was coming toward them on his way to the worship site. 
1SA.9.15	 Now, the L
1SA.9.16	 “About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the territory of Benjamin. Anoint him to be ruler of my people Israel. He will save my people from the Philistines because I’ve seen my people’s ⌊suffering⌋ and their cry has come to me.” 
1SA.9.17	 When Samuel noticed Saul, the L
1SA.9.18	 Saul approached Samuel inside the gateway and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”
1SA.9.19	 Samuel replied, “I’m the seer. Go ahead of me to the worship site. You will eat with me today. In the morning I’ll let you go after I tell you all that’s on your mind. 
1SA.9.20	 Don’t trouble yourself about the donkeys that were lost three days ago because they’ve been found. Who will have all that is desirable in Israel? Won’t it be you and your father’s family?”
1SA.9.21	 Saul replied, “I am a man from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe of Israel. My family is the most insignificant of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin. So why are you saying such things to me?”
1SA.9.22	 Samuel brought Saul and his servant to the banquet hall and had them sit at the head of the guests—about 30 people. 
1SA.9.23	 Samuel said to the cook, “Bring me the portion of the sacrificial meat that I gave you and told you to put aside.” 
1SA.9.24	 So the cook picked up the leg and thigh 
1SA.9.25	 Then they left the worship site for the city. They spread blankets on the roof for Saul, and he slept there.
1SA.9.26	 At dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up! ⌊It’s time for⌋ me to send you away.” Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went outside. 
1SA.9.27	 As they were going toward the city limits, Samuel told Saul, “Have the servant go ahead of you.” (He went ahead.) “But you stay here, and I will tell you God’s word.”
1SA.10.1	 Samuel took a flask of olive oil, poured it on Saul’s head, kissed him, and said, “The L
1SA.10.2	 When you leave me today, two men will be at Rachel’s grave on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. They’ll tell you, ‘We’ve found the donkeys you went looking for. Your father no longer cares about them. Instead, he’s worried about you. He keeps asking, “What can I do ⌊to find⌋ my son?”’ 
1SA.10.3	 Keep going until you come to the oak tree at Tabor. There you will find three men on their way to worship God at Bethel: One will be carrying three young goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a ⌊full⌋ wineskin. 
1SA.10.4	 They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you should accept from them. 
1SA.10.5	 After that, you will come to the hill of God, where the Philistines have a military post. When you arrive at the city, you will meet a group of prophets prophesying as they come from the worship site. They will be led by men playing a harp, a tambourine, a flute, and a lyre. 
1SA.10.6	 Then the L
1SA.10.7	 When these signs happen to you, do what you must, because God is with you. 
1SA.10.8	 Go ahead of me to Gilgal. Then I will come to sacrifice burnt offerings and make fellowship offerings. Wait seven days until I come to tell you what to do.”
1SA.10.9	 When Saul turned around to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s attitude. That day all these signs happened. 
1SA.10.10	 When Saul came to the hill, a group of prophets came to meet him, and God’s Spirit came over him. He prophesied with them. 
1SA.10.11	 When all who had known him before saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people asked one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul one of the prophets?” 
1SA.10.12	 But a man from that place asked, “But who’s the chief prophet?” So it became a proverb: “Is Saul one of the prophets?” 
1SA.10.13	 And when he had finished prophesying, he came to the worship site.
1SA.10.14	 Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where did you go?”
1SA.10.14	Saul answered, “To look for the donkeys, and when we couldn’t find them, we went to Samuel.”
1SA.10.15	 Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”
1SA.10.16	 “He assured us the donkeys had been found,” Saul answered his uncle. But Saul didn’t tell him what Samuel said ⌊about his becoming king⌋.
1SA.10.17	 Samuel called the people to ⌊come into the presence of⌋ the L
1SA.10.18	 He said to the Israelites, “This is what the L
1SA.10.19	 But now you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your troubles and distresses. You said, ‘No! Place a king over us.’ Now then, stand in front of the L
1SA.10.20	 When Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen. 
1SA.10.21	 When he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by families, the family of Matri was chosen. Then Saul, the son of Kish, was chosen. They looked for him but couldn’t find him. 
1SA.10.22	 They asked the L
1SA.10.22	The L
1SA.10.23	 They ran and got him from there. As he stood among the people, he was a head taller than everyone else. 
1SA.10.24	 Samuel asked the people, “Do you see whom the L
1SA.10.24	Then all the people shouted, “Long live the king!”
1SA.10.25	 Samuel explained the laws concerning kingship to the people. He wrote the laws on a scroll, which he placed in front of the L
1SA.10.26	 Saul also went home to Gibeah. With him went some soldiers whose hearts God had touched. 
1SA.10.27	 However, some good-for-nothing people asked, “How can this man save us?” They despised him and wouldn’t bring him presents, but he didn’t respond.
1SA.11.1	 King Nahash of Ammon was severely oppressing the tribes of Gad and Reuben. He would poke out everyone’s right eye and allow no one to rescue Israel. There was no one among the Israelites east of the Jordan River whose right eye King Nahash of Ammon had not poked out. However, seven thousand men had escaped from the Ammonites and gone to Jabesh Gilead. About a month later 
1SA.11.2	 Nahash the Ammon ite responded, “I’ll make a treaty with you on this one condition: I’ll poke out everyone’s right eye and bring disgrace on all Israel.”
1SA.11.3	 The leaders of Jabesh told him, “Give us seven days so that we can send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. And if there’s no one to save us, we’ll surrender to you.”
1SA.11.4	 The messengers came to Saul’s town, Gibeah. When they told the people the news, the people cried loudly. 
1SA.11.5	 Just then Saul was coming from the field behind some oxen. “Why are these people crying?” Saul asked. So they told him the news about the men of Jabesh. 
1SA.11.6	 When he heard this news, God’s Spirit came over him, and he became very angry. 
1SA.11.7	 Saul took a pair of oxen, cut them in pieces, and sent them by messengers throughout the territory of Israel with the following message: “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who doesn’t follow Saul and Samuel ⌊into battle⌋.” So the people became terrified by the L
1SA.11.8	 When Saul counted them at Bezek, there were 300,000 troops from Israel and 30,000 troops from Judah. 
1SA.11.9	 They told the messengers who had come, “This is what you are to say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun gets hot, you will be rescued.’” When the men of Jabesh received the message, they were overjoyed.
1SA.11.10	 They said ⌊to Nahash⌋, “Tomorrow we’ll surrender to you, and you may do to us whatever you think is right.”
1SA.11.11	 The next day Saul arranged the army in three divisions. They came into the ⌊Ammon ite⌋ camp during the morning hours and continued to defeat the Ammonites until it got hot that day. The survivors were so scattered that no two of them were left together.
1SA.11.12	 Then the people asked Samuel, “Who said that Saul shouldn’t rule us? Let us have them, and we’ll kill them.”
1SA.11.13	 But Saul said, “No one will be killed today, because today the L
1SA.11.14	 Samuel told the troops, “Come, let’s go to Gilgal and there acknowledge ⌊Saul’s⌋ kingship.” 
1SA.11.15	 Then all the troops went to Gilgal, and there in the L
1SA.12.1	 Then Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to everything you have said to me and appointed a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	 And now, here is the king who will lead you. I am old and gray, but my sons are with you. I have led you from my youth until this day. 
1SA.12.3	 Here I am. Testify against me in front of the L

1SA.13.1	 Saul was ⌊thirty⌋ years old when he became king, and he was king of Israel ⌊forty-two⌋ years.
1SA.13.2	 Saul chose 3,000 men from Israel; 2,000 of them were stationed with Saul at Michmash and in the mountains of Bethel, and 1,000 were stationed with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. But the rest of the people he sent home.
1SA.13.3	 Jonathan defeated the Philistine troops at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. With the sounding of the ram’s horn throughout the land, Saul announced, “Listen, Hebrews!” 
1SA.13.4	 (So all Israel listened.) “I, Saul, have defeated the Philistine troops, and now Israel has become offensive to the Philistines!” All the troops rallied behind Saul at Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	 The Philistines assembled to fight against Israel. They had 30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen, and as many soldiers as the sand on the seashore. They camped at Michmash, east of Beth Aven. 
1SA.13.6	 When the Israelites saw they were in trouble because the army was hard-pressed, they hid in caves, in thorny thickets, among rocks, in pits, and in cisterns. 
1SA.13.7	 Some Hebrews crossed the Jordan River into the territory of Gad and Gilead. But Saul remained in Gilgal, and all the people who followed him trembled ⌊in fear⌋.
1SA.13.8	 He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel. But Samuel had not come to Gilgal, and the troops began to scatter. 
1SA.13.9	 Then Saul said, “Bring me the animals for the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” So he sacrificed the burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	 As he finished sacrificing the burnt offering, Samuel came, and Saul went to greet him.
1SA.13.11	 Samuel asked, “What have you done?”
1SA.13.11	Saul replied, “I saw the troops were scattering. You didn’t come when you said you would, and the Philistines were assembling at Michmash. 
1SA.13.12	 So I thought, ‘Now, the Philistines will come against me at Gilgal, but I haven’t sought the L

1SA.13.15	 Samuel left Gilgal. The rest of the people followed Saul to meet the soldiers. They went from Gilgal 
1SA.13.16	 Saul, his son Jonathan, and the troops who were with them stayed at Geba in Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash.
1SA.13.17	 Raiding parties left the Philistine camp in three columns. One column turned onto the road to Ophrah to the region of Shual. 
1SA.13.18	 Another column turned onto the road to Beth Horon. And one turned onto the road toward the region that overlooks the valley of Zeboim and the desert.
1SA.13.19	 No blacksmith could be found in the entire land of Israel. In this way the Philistines kept the Hebrews from making swords and spears. 
1SA.13.20	 Everyone in Israel had to go to the Philistines to sharpen the blade of his plow, his mattock, ax, or sickle. 
1SA.13.21	 The price was a pim 
1SA.13.22	 So on the day of battle, not one sword or spear could be found among all the troops who were with Saul and Jonathan. But Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
1SA.13.23	 Now, Philistine troops had gone out to the pass at Michmash.
1SA.14.1	 One day Saul’s son Jonathan said to his armorbearer, “Let’s go to the Philistine military post on the other side.” But Jonathan didn’t tell his father ⌊he was going⌋.
1SA.14.2	 Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree at Migron. He had with him about 600 men 
1SA.14.3	 in addition to Ahijah, the son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub, who was the son of Phinehas and the grandson of Eli, the L
1SA.14.3	The troops didn’t know Jonathan had left. 
1SA.14.4	 There was a cliff on each side of the mountain pass where Jonathan searched for a way to cross over to attack the Philistine military post. The name of one ⌊cliff⌋ was Bozez, and the name of the other was Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	 One cliff stood like a pillar on the north facing Michmash, the other stood south facing Geba.
1SA.14.6	 Jonathan said to his armorbearer, “Let’s go to the military post of these uncircumcised people. Maybe the L
1SA.14.7	 His armorbearer answered him, “Do whatever you have in mind. Go ahead! I agree with you.”
1SA.14.8	 Jonathan continued, “Listen, we’ll cross over to the Philistines and show ourselves to them. 
1SA.14.9	 If they say to us, ‘Stay where you are until we come to you,’ then we’ll stay where we are and not go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	 But if they say to us, ‘Come up here,’ then we’ll go up, because that will be our sign that the L
1SA.14.11	 So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine troops. The Philistines said, “Look, some Hebrews are coming out of the holes they were hiding in.”
1SA.14.12	 “Come up here,” the men of the military post said to Jonathan and his armorbearer. “We have something to show you.”
1SA.14.12	Jonathan told his armorbearer, “Follow me up ⌊to the military post⌋ because the L
1SA.14.13	 Jonathan climbed up ⌊the cliff⌋, and his armorbearer followed him. Jonathan struck down the Philistines. His armorbearer, who was behind him, finished killing them. 
1SA.14.14	 In their first slaughter Jonathan and his armorbearer killed about twenty men within about a hundred yards. 
1SA.14.15	 There was panic among the army in the field and all the troops in the military post. The raiding party also trembled ⌊in fear⌋. The earth shook, and there was a panic sent from God.
1SA.14.16	 Saul’s watchmen at Gibeah in Benjamin could see the crowd ⌊in the Philistine camp⌋ dispersing in all directions.
1SA.14.17	 “Look around,” Saul told the troops who were with him, “and see who has left ⌊our camp⌋.” They looked and found that Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.
1SA.14.18	 Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the priestly ephod,” because Ahijah carried the ephod in front of Israel that day.
1SA.14.19	 While Saul was talking to the priest, the confusion in the Philistine camp grew worse and worse. Then Saul said to the priest, “Remove your hand ⌊from the ephod⌋.” 
1SA.14.20	 Saul and all the troops with him assembled and went into battle. They found Philistine soldiers killing their fellow soldiers in wild confusion. 
1SA.14.21	 The Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before this and had been stationed in the camp now joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
1SA.14.22	 When all the men of Israel who had been hiding in the mountains of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also pursued the Philistines in battle. 
1SA.14.23	 So the L
1SA.14.23	Now, the battle moved beyond Beth Aven. 
1SA.14.24	 Israel’s soldiers were driven hard that day. Saul made the troops swear, “Cursed is anyone who eats food before the evening comes and before I’ve gotten revenge on my enemies.” So none of his troops tasted any food. 
1SA.14.25	 The entire land had honeycombs,
1SA.14.26	 When the troops entered the woods, the honey was flowing. But no one put his hand to his mouth, because the troops were afraid of violating their oath.
1SA.14.27	 Jonathan hadn’t heard that his father forced the troops to take an oath. So he stretched out the tip of the staff he had in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb. When he put it to his mouth, his eyes lit up. 
1SA.14.28	 Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father forced the troops to take a solemn oath: ‘Cursed is anyone who eats food today.’”
1SA.14.28	Now, the army was exhausted. 
1SA.14.29	 Jonathan answered, “My father has brought trouble to the country. See how my eyes lit up when I tasted a little of this honey? 
1SA.14.30	 If only the troops had eaten some of the enemies’ food, which they found today. We would have killed more Philistines.”
1SA.14.31	 That day they struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, but the troops were thoroughly exhausted. 
1SA.14.32	 So the troops seized the Philistines’ belongings. They took sheep, cows, and calves, and butchered them on the ground. The troops ate the meat with blood still in it. 
1SA.14.33	 Some ⌊soldiers⌋ told Saul, “The troops are sinning against the L
1SA.14.33	Saul replied, “You have been unfaithful. Roll a large rock over to me now.” 
1SA.14.34	 Then Saul said, “Spread out through the troops, and tell them, ‘Each of you, bring me your ox or your sheep, and butcher it here, and eat. But don’t sin against the L
1SA.14.34	So each of the soldiers brought his ox with him that night and butchered it there.
1SA.14.35	 Then Saul built an altar to the L
1SA.14.36	 Saul said ⌊to his men⌋, “Let’s attack the Philistines tonight and take their possessions until the light of dawn. And let’s not leave any of them ⌊alive⌋.”
1SA.14.36	“Do whatever you think is best,” they responded.
1SA.14.36	But the priest said, “Let’s consult God first.”
1SA.14.37	 Then Saul asked God, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to Israel?” But he received no answer that day.
1SA.14.38	 So Saul ordered all the leaders of the troops, “Come here! Find out what sin was committed today. 
1SA.14.39	 I solemnly swear, as the L
1SA.14.40	 Saul told all Israel, “You stand on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will stand on the other side.”
1SA.14.40	“Do whatever you think is best,” the troops responded to Saul.
1SA.14.41	 Then Saul said to the L
1SA.14.42	 “Choose between me and my son Jonathan,” Saul said. Then Jonathan was chosen.
1SA.14.43	 “Tell me,” Saul asked Jonathan. “What did you do?”
1SA.14.43	So Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff I had in my hand. And for that I am to die?”
1SA.14.44	 Saul said, “May God do worse things to me than are in this curse if you do not die, Jonathan!”
1SA.14.45	 The troops asked Saul, “Should Jonathan die after he has won this great victory in Israel? That would be unthinkable! We solemnly swear, as the L
1SA.14.46	 Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines. So the Philistines returned to their own land.
1SA.14.47	 When Saul had taken over the kingdom of Israel, he fought against his enemies on every side—against Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he was victorious. 
1SA.14.48	 He acted forcefully and defeated Amalek. He rescued Israel from the enemies who looted their possessions.
1SA.14.49	 Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. The names of his two daughters were Merab (the firstborn daughter) and Michal (the younger daughter). 
1SA.14.50	 The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Saul’s uncle Ner. 
1SA.14.51	 Kish (Saul’s father) and Ner (Abner’s father) were the sons of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	 There was intense warfare with the Philistines as long as Saul lived. Whenever any warrior or any skilled fighting man came to Saul’s attention, Saul would enlist him in the army.
1SA.15.1	 Samuel told Saul, “The L
1SA.15.2	 This is what the L
1SA.15.3	 Now go and attack Amalek. Claim everything they have for God by destroying it. Don’t spare them, but kill men and women, infants and children, cows and sheep, camels and donkeys.”
1SA.15.4	 Saul organized the troops, and he counted them at Telaim: 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men from Judah. 
1SA.15.5	 Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the valley. 
1SA.15.6	 Then Saul said to the Kenites, “Get away from the Amalekites so that I won’t destroy you with them. You were kind to all the Israelites when they came from Egypt.” So the Kenites left the Amalekites.
1SA.15.7	 Saul attacked the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur, east of Egypt. 
1SA.15.8	 He captured King Agag of Amalek alive. But he claimed all the people for God by destroying them. 
1SA.15.9	 Saul and the army spared Agag and the best sheep and cows, the fattened animals, the lambs, and all the best ⌊property⌋. The army refused to claim them for God by destroying them. But everything that was worthless and weak the army did claim for God and destroy.
1SA.15.10	 Then the L
1SA.15.11	 “I regret that I made Saul king. He turned away from me and did not carry out my instructions.” Samuel was angry, and he prayed to the L
1SA.15.12	 Early in the morning he got up to meet Saul. Samuel was told, “Saul went to Carmel to set up a monument in his honor. Then he left there and went to Gilgal.”
1SA.15.13	 Samuel came to Saul, who said, “The L
1SA.15.14	 However, Samuel asked,
1SA.15.14	“But what is this sound of sheep in my ears
1SA.15.14	and this sound of cows that I hear?”
1SA.15.15	 Saul answered, “The army brought them from the Amalekites. They spared the best sheep and cows to sacrifice to the L
1SA.15.16	 “Be quiet,” Samuel told Saul, “and let me tell you what the L
1SA.15.16	“Speak,” Saul replied.
1SA.15.17	 Samuel said, “Even though you don’t consider yourself great, you were the head of Israel’s tribes. The L
1SA.15.18	 And the L
1SA.15.19	 Why didn’t you obey the L
1SA.15.20	 “But I did obey the L
1SA.15.21	 The army took some of their belongings—the best sheep and cows were claimed for God—in order to sacrifice to the L
1SA.15.22	 Then Samuel said,
1SA.15.22	“Is the L
1SA.15.22	as he would be with your obedience?
1SA.15.22	To follow instructions is better than to sacrifice.
1SA.15.22	To obey is better than sacrificing the fat of rams.
1SA.15.23	 The sin of black magic is rebellion.
1SA.15.23	Wickedness and idolatry are arrogance.
1SA.15.23	Because you rejected the word of the L
1SA.15.23	he rejects you as king.”
1SA.15.24	 Then Saul told Samuel, “I have sinned by not following the L
1SA.15.25	 Now please forgive my sin and come back with me so that I may worship the L
1SA.15.26	 Samuel told Saul, “I will not go back with you because you rejected what the L
1SA.15.27	 When Samuel turned to leave, Saul grabbed the hem of his robe, and it tore. 
1SA.15.28	 Samuel told him, “The L
1SA.15.29	 In addition, the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind, because he is not a mortal who changes his mind.”
1SA.15.30	 Saul replied, “I have sinned! Now please honor me in front of the leaders of my people and in front of Israel. Come back with me, and let me worship the L
1SA.15.31	 Then Samuel turned and followed Saul, and Saul worshiped the L
1SA.15.32	 “Bring me King Agag of Amalek,” Samuel said.
1SA.15.32	Agag came to him trembling.
1SA.15.33	 But Samuel said, “As your sword made women childless, so your mother will be made childless among women.” And Samuel cut Agag in pieces in the presence of the L
1SA.15.34	 Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went to his home at Gibeah. 
1SA.15.35	 Samuel didn’t see Saul again before he died, though Samuel mourned over Saul. And the L
1SA.16.1	 The L
1SA.16.2	 “How can I go?” Samuel asked. “When Saul hears about it, he’ll kill me.”
1SA.16.2	The L
1SA.16.3	 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice. I will reveal to you what you should do, and you will anoint for me the one I point out to you.”
1SA.16.4	 Samuel did what the L

1SA.16.6	 When they came, he saw Eliab and thought, “Certainly, here in the L
1SA.16.7	 But the L
1SA.16.8	 Then Jesse called Abinadab and brought him to Samuel. But Samuel said, “The L
1SA.16.9	 Then Jesse had Shammah come to Samuel. “The L
1SA.16.10	 So Jesse brought seven ⌊more⌋ of his sons to Samuel, but Samuel told Jesse, “The L
1SA.16.11	 Are these all the sons you have?”
1SA.16.11	“There’s still the youngest one,” Jesse answered. “He’s tending the sheep.”
1SA.16.11	Samuel told Jesse, “Send someone to get him. We won’t continue until he gets here.”
1SA.16.12	 So Jesse sent for him. He had a healthy complexion, attractive eyes, and a handsome appearance. The L
1SA.16.13	 Samuel took the flask of olive oil and anointed David in the presence of his brothers. The L
1SA.16.14	 Now, the L
1SA.16.15	 Saul’s officials told him, “An evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
1SA.16.16	 Your Majesty, why don’t you command us to look for a man who can play the lyre well? When the evil spirit from God comes to you, he’ll strum a tune, and you’ll feel better.”
1SA.16.17	 Saul told his officials, “Please find me a man who can play well and bring him to me.”
1SA.16.18	 One of the officials said, “I know one of Jesse’s sons from Bethlehem who can play well. He’s a courageous man and a warrior. He has a way with words, he is handsome, and the L
1SA.16.19	 Saul sent messengers to Jesse to say, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.”
1SA.16.20	 Jesse took six bushels of bread, a full wineskin, and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul. 
1SA.16.21	 David came to Saul and served him. Saul loved him very much and made David his armorbearer. 
1SA.16.22	 Saul sent ⌊this message⌋ to Jesse, “Please let David stay with me because I have grown fond of him.”
1SA.16.23	 Whenever God’s spirit came to Saul, David took the lyre and strummed a tune. Saul got relief ⌊from his terror⌋ and felt better, and the evil spirit left him.
1SA.17.1	 The Philistines assembled their armies for war. They assembled at Socoh, which is in Judah, and camped between Socoh and Azekah at Ephes Dammim. 
1SA.17.2	 So Saul and the army of Israel assembled and camped in the Elah Valley. They formed a battle line to fight the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	 The Philistines were stationed on a hill on one side, and the Israelites were stationed on a hill on the other side. There was a ravine between the two of them.
1SA.17.4	 The Philistine army’s champion came out of their camp. His name was Goliath from Gath. He was ten feet tall.
1SA.17.5	 He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he wore a bronze coat of armor scales weighing 125 pounds. 
1SA.17.6	 On his legs he had bronze shin guards and on his back a bronze javelin. 
1SA.17.7	 The shaft of his spear was like the beam used by weavers. The head of his spear was made of 15 pounds of iron. The man who carried his shield walked ahead of him.
1SA.17.8	 Goliath stood and called to the Israelites, “Why do you form a battle line? Am I not a Philistine, and aren’t you Saul’s servants? Choose a man, and let him come down to ⌊fight⌋ me. 
1SA.17.9	 If he can fight me and kill me, then we will be your slaves. But if I overpower him and kill him, then you will be our slaves and serve us.” 
1SA.17.10	 The Philistine added, “I challenge the Israelite battle line today. Send out a man so that we can fight each other.” 
1SA.17.11	 When Saul and all the Israelites heard what this Philistine said, they were gripped with fear.
1SA.17.12	 David was a son of a man named Jesse from the region of Ephrath and the city of Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul’s day he was an old man.
1SA.17.13	 Jesse’s three oldest sons joined Saul’s army for the battle. The firstborn was Eliab, the second was Abinadab, the third was Shammah, 
1SA.17.14	 and David was the youngest. The three oldest joined Saul’s army. 
1SA.17.15	 David went back and forth from Saul’s camp to Bethlehem, where he tended his father’s flock.
1SA.17.16	 Each morning and evening for 40 days, the Philistine came forward and made his challenge.
1SA.17.17	 Jesse told his son David, “Take this half-bushel of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread to your brothers. Take them to your brothers in the camp right away. 
1SA.17.18	 And take these ten cheeses to the captain of the regiment. See how your brothers are doing, and bring back some news about them. 
1SA.17.19	 They, along with Saul and all the soldiers of Israel, are in the Elah Valley fighting the Philistines.”
1SA.17.20	 David got up early in the morning and had someone else watch ⌊the sheep⌋. He took ⌊the food⌋ and went, as Jesse ordered him. He went to the camp as the army was going out to the battle line shouting their war cry. 
1SA.17.21	 Israel and the Philistines formed their battle lines facing each other. 
1SA.17.22	 David left the supplies behind in the hands of the quartermaster, ran to the battle line, and greeted his brothers. 
1SA.17.23	 While he was talking to them, the Philistine champion, Goliath from Gath, came from the battle lines of the Philistines. He repeated his words, and David heard them. 
1SA.17.24	 When all the men of Israel saw Goliath, they fled from him because they were terrified. 
1SA.17.25	 The men of Israel said, “Did you see that man coming ⌊from the Philistine lines⌋? He keeps coming to challenge Israel. The king will make the man who kills this Philistine very rich. He will give his daughter to that man to marry and elevate the social status of his family.” 
1SA.17.26	 David asked the men who were standing near him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and gets rid of Israel’s disgrace? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should challenge the army of the living God?”
1SA.17.27	 The soldiers repeated ⌊to David⌋ how the man who kills Goliath would be treated.
1SA.17.28	 Eliab, David’s oldest brother, heard David talking to the men. Then Eliab became angry with David. “Why did you come here,” he asked him, “and with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how overconfident and headstrong you are. You came here just to see the battle.”
1SA.17.29	 “What have I done now?” David snapped at him. “Didn’t I ⌊merely⌋ ask a question?” 
1SA.17.30	 He turned to face another man and asked the same question, and the other soldiers gave him the same answer.
1SA.17.31	 What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, who then sent for him. 
1SA.17.32	 David told Saul, “No one should be discouraged because of this. I will go and fight this Philistine.”
1SA.17.33	 Saul responded to David, “You can’t fight this Philistine. You’re just a boy, but he’s been a warrior since he was your age.”
1SA.17.34	 David replied to Saul, “I am a shepherd for my father’s sheep. Whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, 
1SA.17.35	 I went after it, struck it, and rescued the sheep from its mouth. If it attacked me, I took hold of its mane, struck it, and killed it. 
1SA.17.36	 I have killed lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them because he has challenged the army of the living God.” 
1SA.17.37	 David added, “The L
1SA.17.37	“Go,” Saul told David, “and may the L
1SA.17.38	 Saul put his battle tunic on David; he put a bronze helmet on David’s head and dressed him in armor. 
1SA.17.39	 David fastened Saul’s sword over his clothes and tried to walk, but he had never practiced doing this. “I can’t walk in these things,” David told Saul. “I’ve never had any practice doing this.” So David took all those things off.
1SA.17.40	 He took his stick with him, picked out five smooth stones from the riverbed, and put them in his shepherd’s bag. With a sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine. 
1SA.17.41	 The Philistine, preceded by the man carrying his shield, was coming closer and closer to David. 
1SA.17.42	 When the Philistine got a good look at David, he despised him. After all, David was a young man with a healthy complexion and good looks.
1SA.17.43	 The Philistine asked David, “Am I a dog that you come to ⌊attack⌋ me with sticks?” So the Philistine called on his gods to curse David. 
1SA.17.44	 “Come on,” the Philistine told David, “and I’ll give your body to the birds.”
1SA.17.45	 David told the Philistine, “You come to me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come to you in the name of the L
1SA.17.46	 Today the L
1SA.17.47	 Then everyone gathered here will know that the L
1SA.17.48	 When the Philistine moved closer in order to attack, David quickly ran toward the opposing battle line to attack the Philistine. 
1SA.17.49	 Then David reached into his bag, took out a stone, hurled it from his sling, and struck the Philistine in the forehead. The stone sank into Goliath’s forehead, and he fell to the ground on his face. 
1SA.17.50	 So using ⌊only⌋ a sling and a stone, David proved to be stronger than the Philistine. David struck down and killed the Philistine, even though David didn’t have a sword in his hand. 
1SA.17.51	 David ran and stood over the Philistine. He took Goliath’s sword, pulled it out of its sheath, and made certain the Philistine was dead by cutting off his head.
1SA.17.51	When the Philistines saw their hero had been killed, they fled. 
1SA.17.52	 Then the soldiers of Israel and Judah rose up, shouted a battle cry, and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Wounded Philistines lay on the road to Shaaraim and all the way to Gath and Ekron. 
1SA.17.53	 When the Israelites came back from their pursuit of the Philistines, they looted all the goods in the Philistine camp. 
1SA.17.54	 David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he kept Goliath’s armor in his tent.
1SA.17.55	 As Saul watched David going out against the Philistine, he asked Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?”
1SA.17.55	Abner answered, “I solemnly swear, as you live, Your Majesty, I don’t know.”
1SA.17.56	 The king said, “Find out whose son this young man is.”
1SA.17.57	 When David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner brought him to Saul. David had the Philistine’s head in his hand.
1SA.17.58	 Saul asked him, “Whose son are you, young man?”
1SA.17.58	“The son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem,” David answered.
1SA.18.1	 David finished talking to Saul. After that, Jonathan became David’s closest friend. He loved David as much as ⌊he loved⌋ himself. 
1SA.18.2	 (From that day on Saul kept David ⌊as his servant⌋ and didn’t let him go back to his family.) 
1SA.18.3	 So Jonathan made a pledge of mutual loyalty with David because he loved him as much as ⌊he loved⌋ himself. 
1SA.18.4	 Jonathan took off the coat he had on and gave it to David along with his battle tunic, his sword, his bow, and his belt.
1SA.18.5	 David was successful wherever Saul sent him. Saul put him in charge of the fighting men. This pleased all the people, including Saul’s officials.
1SA.18.6	 As they arrived, David was returning from a campaign against the Philistines. Women from all of Israel’s cities came to meet King Saul. They sang and danced, accompanied by tambourines, joyful music, and triangles.
1SA.18.7	 The women who were celebrating sang,
1SA.18.7	“Saul has defeated thousands
1SA.18.7	but David tens of thousands!”
1SA.18.8	 Saul became very angry because he considered this saying to be insulting. “To David they credit tens of thousands,” he said, “but to me they credit ⌊only⌋ a few thousand. The only thing left for David is my kingdom.” 
1SA.18.9	 From that day on Saul kept an eye on David.
1SA.18.10	 The next day an evil spirit from God seized Saul. He began to prophesy in his house while David strummed a tune on the lyre as he did every day. Now, Saul had a spear in his hand. 
1SA.18.11	 He raised the spear and thought, “I’ll nail David to the wall.” But David got away from him twice.
1SA.18.12	 Saul was afraid of David, because the L
1SA.18.13	 So he kept David away. He made David captain of a regiment. David led the troops out ⌊to battle⌋ and back again. 
1SA.18.14	 He was successful in everything he undertook because the L
1SA.18.15	 Saul noticed how very successful he was and became ⌊even more⌋ afraid of him. 
1SA.18.16	 Everyone in Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in and out ⌊of battle⌋.
1SA.18.17	 Finally, Saul said to David, “Here is my oldest daughter Merab. I will give her to you as your wife if you prove yourself to be a warrior for me and fight the L
1SA.18.18	 “Who am I?” David asked Saul. “And how important are my relatives or my father’s family in Israel that I should be the king’s son-in-law?”
1SA.18.19	 But when the time came to give Saul’s daughter Merab to David, she was married to Adriel from Meholah. 
1SA.18.20	 However, Saul’s daughter Michal fell in love with David. When Saul was told about it, the news pleased him. 
1SA.18.21	 Saul thought, “I’ll give her to David. She will trap him, and the Philistines will get him.” So he said to David a second time, “You will now be my son-in-law.”
1SA.18.22	 Saul ordered his officers, “Talk to David in private. Tell him, ‘The king likes you, and all his officers are fond of you. Become the king’s son-in-law.’ ”
1SA.18.23	 When Saul’s officers made it a point to say this, David asked, “Do you think it’s easy to become the king’s son-in-law? I am a poor and unimportant person.”
1SA.18.24	 When the officers told Saul what David had said, 
1SA.18.25	 Saul replied, “Tell David, ‘The king doesn’t want any payment for the bride except 100 Philistine foreskins so that he can get revenge on his enemies.’” In this way Saul planned to have David fall into the hands of the Philistines. 
1SA.18.26	 When his officers told David this, David concluded that it was acceptable to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the time was up, 
1SA.18.27	 David and his men went out and struck down 200 Philistines. David brought the foreskins, and they counted them out for the king so that David could become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal as his wife. 
1SA.18.28	 Saul realized that the L
1SA.18.29	 Then Saul was even more afraid of David, and so Saul became David’s constant enemy.
1SA.18.30	 The Philistine generals still went out ⌊to fight Israel⌋. But whenever they went out ⌊to fight⌋, David was more successful than the rest of Saul’s officers. So David gained a good reputation.
1SA.19.1	 Saul told his son Jonathan and all his officers to kill David. But Saul’s son Jonathan was very fond of David, 
1SA.19.2	 so he reported to David, “My father Saul is trying to kill you. Please be careful tomorrow morning. Go into hiding, and stay out of sight. 
1SA.19.3	 I’ll go out and stand beside my father in the field where you’ll be. I’ll speak with my father about you. If I find out anything, I’ll tell you.”
1SA.19.4	 So Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul. “You should not commit a sin against your servant David,” he said. “He hasn’t sinned against you. Instead, he has done some very fine things for you: 
1SA.19.5	 He risked his life and killed the Philistine Goliath, and the L
1SA.19.6	 Saul listened to Jonathan, and he promised, “I solemnly swear, as the L
1SA.19.7	 Jonathan told David all of this. Then Jonathan took David to Saul. So David was returned to his former status in Saul’s court.
1SA.19.8	 When war broke out again, David went to fight the Philistines. He defeated them so decisively that they fled from him. 
1SA.19.9	 Then an evil spirit from the L
1SA.19.10	 Saul tried to nail David to the wall with his spear. But David dodged it, and Saul’s spear struck the wall. David fled, escaping ⌊from Saul⌋ that night.
1SA.19.11	 Saul sent messengers to watch David’s house and kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, advised him, “If you don’t save yourself tonight, you’ll be dead tomorrow!” 
1SA.19.12	 So Michal lowered David through a window, and he ran away to escape. 
1SA.19.13	 Then Michal took some idols, laid them in the bed, put a goat-hair blanket at its head, and covered the idols with a garment.
1SA.19.14	 When Saul sent messengers to get David, Michal said, “He’s sick.” 
1SA.19.15	 Then Saul sent the messengers back to see David themselves. Saul told them, “Bring him here to me in his bed so that I can kill him.” 
1SA.19.16	 The messengers came, and there in the bed were the idols with the goat-hair blanket at its head.
1SA.19.17	 Saul asked Michal, “Why did you betray me by sending my enemy away so that he could escape?”
1SA.19.17	Michal answered, “He told me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’ ”
1SA.19.18	 David escaped and went to Samuel at Ramah. He told Samuel everything Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to the pastures and lived there.
1SA.19.19	 When it was reported to Saul that David was in the pastures at Ramah, 
1SA.19.20	 Saul sent messengers to get David. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying with Samuel serving as their leader, God’s Spirit came over Saul’s messengers so that they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.21	 When they told Saul ⌊about this⌋, he sent other messengers, but they also prophesied. Saul even sent a third group of messengers, but they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.22	 Then he went to Ramah himself. He went as far as the big cistern in Secu and asked ⌊the people⌋, “Where are Samuel and David?”
1SA.19.22	He was told, “Over there in the pastures at Ramah.” 
1SA.19.23	 As he went toward the pastures at Ramah, God’s Spirit came over him too. He continued his journey, prophesying until he came to the pastures at Ramah. 
1SA.19.24	 He even took off his clothes as he prophesied in front of Samuel and lay there naked all day and all night. This is where the saying, “Is Saul one of the prophets?” came from.
1SA.20.1	 David fled from the pastures at Ramah, came to Jonathan, and asked, “What have I done? What crime am I guilty of? What sin have I committed against your father that he’s trying to kill me?”
1SA.20.2	 Jonathan answered, “That’s unthinkable! You’re not going to die! My father does nothing without telling me, whether it’s important or not. Why should my father hide this from me? It’s just not that way.”
1SA.20.3	 But David took an oath, saying, “Your father certainly knows that you support me, so he said ⌊to himself⌋, ‘Jonathan must not know about this. It will bring him distress.’ But I solemnly swear, as the L
1SA.20.4	 Jonathan said to David, “I’ll do whatever you say.”
1SA.20.5	 David replied, “Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival, when I should sit and eat at the king’s ⌊table⌋. But let me go and hide in the countryside for two more nights. 
1SA.20.6	 If your father really misses me, tell him, ‘David repeatedly begged me to let him run to Bethlehem, his hometown, because his relatives are offering the annual sacrifice there.’ 
1SA.20.7	 If he says, ‘Good!’ then I will be safe. But if he gets really angry, then you’ll know for sure that he has decided to harm me. 
1SA.20.8	 Now, be kind to me. After all, you forced me into an agreement with the L
1SA.20.9	 Jonathan answered, “That’s unthinkable! If I knew for sure that my father had decided to harm you, I would have told you about it.”
1SA.20.10	 Then David asked, “Who will tell me whether or not your father gives you a harsh answer?”
1SA.20.11	 Jonathan said, “Let’s go out into the country.” So they went out into the country.
1SA.20.12	 “As the L
1SA.20.13	 If my father plans to harm you and I fail to tell you and send you away safely, may the L
1SA.20.14	 But as long as I live, ⌊promise me that you will⌋ show me kindness because of the L
1SA.20.15	 never stop being kind to my family. The Lord will wipe each of David’s enemies off the face of the earth. 
1SA.20.16	 At that time, if Jonathan’s name 
1SA.20.17	 Once again Jonathan swore an oath to David because of his love for David. He loved David as much as ⌊he loved⌋ himself. 
1SA.20.18	 “Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival,” Jonathan told him, “and you will be missed when your seat is empty. 
1SA.20.19	 The day after tomorrow you will be missed even more.
1SA.20.20	 I will shoot three arrows from beside it toward a target. 
1SA.20.21	 Then I will send out a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ Now, if I tell the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are next to you; get them,’ then come ⌊back with me⌋. You will be safe, and there will be no trouble. I swear it, as the L
1SA.20.22	 But if I tell the boy, ‘The arrows are next to you,’ then go, because the L
1SA.20.23	 We have made a promise to each other, and the L
1SA.20.24	 So David hid in the countryside. When the New Moon Festival came, King Saul sat down to eat the festival meal. 
1SA.20.25	 He sat in his usual seat by the wall, while Jonathan stood. Abner sat beside Saul, but David’s place was empty. 
1SA.20.26	 Saul didn’t say anything that day, thinking, “Something has happened to him so that he’s unclean.
1SA.20.27	 But on the second day of the month, David’s place was still empty.
1SA.20.27	Saul asked his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t Jesse’s son come to the meal either yesterday or today?”
1SA.20.28	 Jonathan answered Saul, “David repeatedly begged me ⌊to let him go⌋ to Bethlehem. 
1SA.20.29	 David said to me ‘Please let me go. Our relatives will offer a sacrifice in the city, and my brother ordered me to be there. If you will permit it, please let me go to see my brothers.’ This is why he hasn’t come to your banquet.”
1SA.20.30	 Then Saul got angry with Jonathan. “Son of a crooked and rebellious woman!” he called Jonathan. “I know you’ve sided with Jesse’s son. You have no shame. ⌊You act⌋ as if you are your mother’s son but not mine.
1SA.20.31	 As long as Jesse’s son lives on earth, neither you nor your right to be king is secure. Now, send some men to bring him to me. He’s a dead man!”
1SA.20.32	 Jonathan asked his father, “Why should he be killed? What has he done?”
1SA.20.33	 Saul raised his spear to strike him. Then Jonathan knew his father was determined to kill David. 
1SA.20.34	 Jonathan got up from the table very angry and ate nothing that second day of the month. He was worried sick about David because Jonathan had been humiliated by his own father.
1SA.20.35	 In the morning Jonathan went out to the country to the place he and David had agreed on. Jonathan had a young boy with him. 
1SA.20.36	 “Run,” he told the boy, “please find the arrows I shoot.”
1SA.20.36	The boy ran, and Jonathan shot the arrow over him. 
1SA.20.37	 When the boy reached the place where Jonathan’s arrow ⌊had landed⌋, Jonathan called after him, “The arrows are next to you!” 
1SA.20.38	 Jonathan added, “Quick! Hurry up! Don’t stand there!” Jonathan’s young servant gathered the arrows and came to his master. 
1SA.20.39	 The boy had no idea what was going on, but Jonathan and David understood. 
1SA.20.40	 Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy. He told the boy, “Take them back into town.”
1SA.20.41	 When the boy had left, David came out from the south side ⌊of the rock⌋ and quickly bowed down three times with his face touching the ground. Then they kissed each other and cried together, but David cried the loudest.
1SA.20.42	 “Go in peace!” Jonathan told David. “We have both taken an oath in the L
1SA.20.42	So David left, and Jonathan went into the city.
1SA.21.1	 David went to the priest Ahimelech at Nob. Ahimelech was trembling as he went to meet David. “Why are you alone?” he asked David. “Why is no one with you?”
1SA.21.2	 “The king ordered me to do something,” David answered the priest Ahimelech, “and he told me, ‘No one must know anything about this mission I’m sending you on and about the orders I’ve given you. I’ve stationed 
1SA.21.3	 ⌊David added,⌋ “Now, what do you have ⌊to eat⌋? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find.”
1SA.21.4	 “I don’t have any ordinary bread,” the chief priest answered David. “But there is holy bread for the young men if they haven’t had sexual intercourse ⌊today⌋.”
1SA.21.5	 David answered the priest, “Of course women have been kept away from us as usual when we go ⌊on a mission⌋. The young men’s bodies are kept holy even on ordinary campaigns. How much more then will their bodies be holy today?”
1SA.21.6	 So the priest gave him holy ⌊bread⌋ because he only had the bread of the presence which had been taken from the L
1SA.21.7	 That same day one of Saul’s servants who was obligated to stay in the L
1SA.21.8	 David asked Ahimelech, “Don’t you have a spear or a sword here? I didn’t take either my spear or any other weapon because the king’s business was urgent.”
1SA.21.9	 The chief priest answered, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Elah Valley, is here. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the priestly ephod.
1SA.21.9	David said, “There’s none like it. Let me have the sword.”
1SA.21.10	 That day David left. He was ⌊still⌋ fleeing from Saul when he came to King Achish of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	 Achish’s officers asked, “Isn’t this David, the king of ⌊his⌋ country? He’s the one they used to sing about in the dances:
1SA.21.11	‘Saul has defeated thousands
1SA.21.11	but David tens of thousands.’ ”
1SA.21.12	 When David realized what they had said, he was terrified of King Achish of Gath. 
1SA.21.13	 So he changed his behavior ⌊when he was⌋ in their presence and acted insane ⌊as long as he was⌋ under their authority. He scribbled on the doors of the city gate and let his spit run down his beard.
1SA.21.14	 Achish said to his officers, “Look at him! Don’t you see ⌊that he’s⌋ insane? Why bring him to me? 
1SA.21.15	 Do I have such a shortage of lunatics that you bring this man so that he can show me he is insane? Does this man have to come into my house?”
1SA.22.1	 So David escaped from that place and fled to the cave at Adullam. When his brothers and all ⌊the rest⌋ of his family heard about it, they went to him. 
1SA.22.2	 Then everyone who was in trouble, in debt, or bitter about life joined him, and he became their commander. There were about four hundred men with him.
1SA.22.3	 From there David went to Mizpah in Moab. He asked the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God is going to do for me.” 
1SA.22.4	 He brought them to the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was living in his fortified camp.
1SA.22.5	 “Don’t live in your fortified camp,” the prophet Gad told David. “Go to the land of Judah.” So David went to the forest of Hereth.
1SA.22.6	 Saul heard that David and his men had been found. Saul was staying in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree at the worship site 
1SA.22.7	 He said to his officials, “Listen here, men of Benjamin! Will Jesse’s son give every one of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all officers over a regiment or a battalion of soldiers? 
1SA.22.8	 All of you are plotting against me, and no one informed me when my son entered into a loyalty pledge with Jesse’s son. No one felt sorry for me and informed me that my son has encouraged my servant David to ambush me, as he’s doing now.”
1SA.22.9	 Then Doeg from Edom, standing with Saul’s officials, answered him, “I saw Jesse’s son when he came to Ahimelech, Ahitub’s son, in Nob. 
1SA.22.10	 Ahimelech prayed to the L
1SA.22.11	 Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelech, who was Ahitub’s son, and his entire family who were the priests in Nob. All of them came to the king. 
1SA.22.12	 Saul said, “Listen here, son of Ahitub!”
1SA.22.12	“Yes, sir?” he responded.
1SA.22.13	 Saul asked him, “Why did you and Jesse’s son plot against me? You gave him bread and a sword and prayed to God for him so that he can rise up against me and ambush me, as he’s doing now.”
1SA.22.14	 Ahimelech asked the king, “But whom among all your officials can you trust like David? Your Majesty, he’s your son-in-law, the commander of your bodyguard. He’s honored in your own household. 
1SA.22.15	 Is this the first time I have prayed to God for him? Not at all! You shouldn’t blame me or anyone in my family for this. I knew nothing at all about this.”
1SA.22.16	 Saul said, “Ahimelech, you and your entire family are going to die.”
1SA.22.17	 “Turn and kill the L
1SA.22.18	 So the king said to Doeg, “You turn and attack the priests.” Doeg from Edom turned and attacked the priests, and that day he killed 85 men wearing the linen priestly ephod.
1SA.22.19	 He also killed the people of Nob, the city of the priests. Using ⌊his⌋ sword, he killed men and women, children and infants, cows, donkeys, and sheep.
1SA.22.20	 But Ahimelech, Ahitub’s son, had one son who escaped. His name was Abiathar. He fled to David. 
1SA.22.21	 Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the L
1SA.22.22	 David told Abiathar, “I knew that day when Doeg from Edom was there that he would be certain to tell Saul. I am the one responsible 
1SA.22.23	 Stay with me. Don’t be afraid. The one who is seeking my life is ⌊also⌋ seeking your life. However, you will be under my protection.”
1SA.23.1	 David was asked, “Did you know that the Philistines are fighting against Keilah? They are robbing the threshing floors.” 
1SA.23.2	 David asked the L
1SA.23.2	“Go,” the L
1SA.23.3	 David’s men told him, “We’re afraid of staying here in Judah. How much more ⌊afraid do you think we’ll be⌋ if we go to Keilah against the Philistine army?”
1SA.23.4	 David asked the L
1SA.23.5	 David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines, drove off their livestock, and decisively defeated them. So David rescued the people who lived in Keilah.
1SA.23.6	 When Ahimelech’s son Abiathar fled to David at Keilah, Abiathar brought a priestly ephod 
1SA.23.7	 When Saul was told that David went to Keilah, Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hands. He has trapped himself by going into a city which has ⌊a gate with⌋ a double door ⌊held shut by⌋ a bar.” 
1SA.23.8	 So Saul called together all the troops to go to war and blockade Keilah, where David and his men were.
1SA.23.9	 When David learned that Saul was planning to harm him, he told the priest Abiathar, “Bring the ephod.” 
1SA.23.10	 Then David said, “L
1SA.23.11	 Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come here as I have heard? L
1SA.23.11	“He will come,” the L
1SA.23.12	 “Will the citizens of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?” David asked.
1SA.23.12	“They will hand you over,” the L
1SA.23.13	 So David and his men, about six hundred 
1SA.23.14	 David lived in fortified camps in the desert, and he lived in fortified camps in the mountains of the desert of Ziph. Saul was always searching for him, but God didn’t let him capture David.
1SA.23.15	 David was afraid because 
1SA.23.16	 Saul’s son Jonathan came to David at Horesh. He strengthened David’s ⌊faith⌋ in the L
1SA.23.17	 “Don’t be afraid,” he told David, “my father Saul won’t find you. You will rule Israel, and I will be your second-in-command. Even my father Saul knows this.” 
1SA.23.18	 Both of them made a pledge in the L
1SA.23.19	 Then the men of Ziph went to Saul in Gibeah. They said, “David is hiding with us in fortified camps at Horesh on the hills of Hachilah, south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.20	 Come, Your Majesty, whenever you want. We will hand him over to you.”
1SA.23.21	 Saul responded, “The L
1SA.23.22	 Please make more plans, and watch where he goes. Who has seen him there? I’m told he’s very clever. 
1SA.23.23	 Watch and learn about all the hiding places where he may be hiding, and come back to me with the facts. Then I’ll go with you, and if he’s in the country, I’ll search for him among all the families of Judah.” 
1SA.23.24	 They left for Ziph ahead of Saul.
1SA.23.24	David and his men were in the desert of Maon, in the plains south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.25	 When Saul and his men came to look for him, David was told the news. So he went to his mountain stronghold in the desert of Maon. Saul heard about it and pursued David into the desert of Maon. 
1SA.23.26	 Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men went on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, and Saul and his men were going around ⌊the mountain⌋ toward David and his men, trying to capture them. 
1SA.23.27	 Then a messenger came to Saul and said, “Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the country.”
1SA.23.28	 Saul gave up pursuing David and went to fight the Philistines. So that place was called Slippery Rock.
1SA.23.29	 From there David went to stay in the fortified camps of En Gedi.
1SA.24.1	 When Saul came back from ⌊fighting⌋ the Philistines, he was told “Now David is in the desert near En Gedi.” 
1SA.24.2	 Then Saul took 3,000 of the best-trained men from all Israel and went to search for David and his men on the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 
1SA.24.3	 He came to some sheep pens along the road where there was a cave. Saul went into ⌊it⌋ to relieve himself while David and his men were sitting further back in the cave.
1SA.24.4	 David’s men told him, “Today is the day the L
1SA.24.4	David quietly got up and cut off the border of Saul’s robe. 
1SA.24.5	 But afterward, David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the border of Saul’s robe. 
1SA.24.6	 He said to his men, “It would be unthinkable for me to raise my hand against His Majesty, the L
1SA.24.7	 So David stopped 
1SA.24.7	Saul left the cave and went out onto the road. 
1SA.24.8	 Later, David got up, left the cave, and called to Saul, “Your Majesty!” When Saul looked back, David knelt down with his face touching the ground. 
1SA.24.9	 David asked Saul, “Why do you listen to rumors that I am trying to harm you? 
1SA.24.10	 Today you saw how the L
1SA.24.11	 My master, look at this! The border of your robe is in my hand! Since I cut off the border of your robe and didn’t kill you, you should know and be able to see I mean no harm or rebellion. I haven’t sinned against you, but you are trying to ambush me in order to take my life. 
1SA.24.12	 May the L
1SA.24.13	 It’s like people used to say long ago, ‘Wickedness comes from wicked people.’ But I will not lay a hand on you. 
1SA.24.14	 Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? One flea? 
1SA.24.15	 So the L
1SA.24.16	 When David finished saying this, Saul asked, “Is that you speaking, my servant David?” and Saul cried loudly. 
1SA.24.17	 He told David, “You are more righteous than I. You treated me well while I treated you badly. 
1SA.24.18	 Today you have proved how good you’ve been to me. When the L
1SA.24.19	 When a person finds an enemy, does he send him away unharmed? The L
1SA.24.20	 Now I know that you certainly will rule as king, and under your guidance the kingdom of Israel will prosper. 
1SA.24.21	 Swear an oath to the L
1SA.24.22	 So David swore to Saul. Then Saul went home, and David and his men went to their fortified camp.
1SA.25.1	 Samuel died, and all Israel gathered to mourn for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David went to the desert of Paran.
1SA.25.2	 Now, there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. He was a very rich man. He had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. And he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
1SA.25.3	 This man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was sensible and beautiful, but he was harsh and mean. He was a descendant of Caleb.
1SA.25.4	 While David was in the desert, he heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
1SA.25.5	 So David sent ten young men and told them, “Go to Carmel, visit Nabal, and greet him for me. 
1SA.25.6	 Say to him, ‘May you live ⌊long⌋! May you, your home, and all you have prosper! 
1SA.25.7	 I hear that your sheepshearers are with you. Your shepherds have been with us, ⌊and⌋ we have not mistreated them. Nothing of theirs has been missing as long as they’ve been in Carmel. 
1SA.25.8	 Ask your young men, and let them tell you. Be kind to my young men, since we have come on a special occasion. Please give us and your son David anything you can ⌊spare⌋.’ ”
1SA.25.9	 When David’s young men came to Nabal, they repeated all of this to him for David, and then they waited.
1SA.25.10	 “Who is David?” Nabal answered David’s servants. “Who is Jesse’s son? So many servants nowadays are leaving their masters. 
1SA.25.11	 Should I take my bread, my water, and my meat that I butchered for my shearers and give them to men coming from who knows where?”
1SA.25.12	 David’s young men returned and told him all this.
1SA.25.13	 “Each of you put on your swords!” David told his men. And everyone, including David, put on his sword. About four hundred men went with David, while two hundred men stayed with the supplies.
1SA.25.14	 One of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David sent messengers from the desert to greet our master, who yelled at them. 
1SA.25.15	 Those men were very good to us. They didn’t mistreat us, and we found that nothing was missing wherever we went with them when we were in the fields. 
1SA.25.16	 They were a wall protecting us day and night as long as we were watching the sheep near them. 
1SA.25.17	 Now, consider what you should do because our master and his whole household are doomed. And he’s such a worthless man that it’s useless to talk to him.”
1SA.25.18	 So Abigail quickly took 200 loaves of bread, 2 full wineskins, 5 butchered sheep, a bushel of roasted grain, 100 bunches of raisins, and 200 fig cakes and loaded them on donkeys. 
1SA.25.19	 “Go on ahead,” she told her young men, “and I’ll follow you.” But she didn’t tell her husband Nabal about it.
1SA.25.20	 She was riding on her donkey down a hidden mountain path when she met David and his men coming toward her. 
1SA.25.21	 David had thought, “I guarded this man’s stuff in the desert for nothing! Not one of his possessions was missing. Yet, he has paid me back with evil when I was good to him. 
1SA.25.22	 May God punish me 
1SA.25.23	 When Abigail saw David, she quickly got down from her donkey. She immediately bowed down in front of David with her face touching the ground. 
1SA.25.24	 After she bowed at his feet, she said, “Sir, let me be held responsible for this wrong. Please let me speak with you. Please listen to my words. 
1SA.25.25	 You shouldn’t take this worthless person Nabal seriously. He is like his name. His name is Nabal [Godless Fool], and he’s foolish. But I didn’t see the young men you sent.
1SA.25.26	 “The L

1SA.25.32	 David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the L
1SA.25.33	 May your good judgment be blessed. Also, may you be blessed for keeping me from slaughtering people today and from getting a victory by my own efforts. 
1SA.25.34	 But I solemnly swear—as the L
1SA.25.35	 Then David accepted what she brought him and told her, “Go home in peace. I’ve listened to what you’ve said and granted your request.”
1SA.25.36	 When Abigail came to Nabal, he was holding a banquet in his home. It was like a king’s banquet. He was in a good mood and very drunk, so she didn’t tell him anything until dawn. 
1SA.25.37	 But in the morning, when the effects of the wine had worn off, his wife told him what had happened. Nabal’s heart failed, and he could not move.
1SA.25.38	 About ten days later the L
1SA.25.39	 When David heard Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the L
1SA.25.39	Then David sent men ⌊on his behalf⌋ to propose marriage to Abigail. 
1SA.25.40	 When David’s servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they told her, “David has sent us to you so that we can take you to him to be his wife.”
1SA.25.41	 She bowed down with her face touching the ground. “I am ready to serve,” she said. “I am ready to wash the feet of my master’s servants.” 
1SA.25.42	 Then Abigail quickly got up and rode on a donkey with five of her female servants following her. So she went with David’s messengers and became his wife.
1SA.25.43	 David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel. Both she and Abigail were his wives. 
1SA.25.44	 Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti, Laish’s son, who was from Gallim.
1SA.26.1	 The people of Ziph came to Saul at Gibeah. “David is hiding at the hill of Hachilah near Jeshimon,” they said.
1SA.26.2	 Saul went to the desert of Ziph, taking with him 3,000 of Israel’s best-trained men to search for David. 
1SA.26.3	 Saul camped by the road at the hill of Hachilah near Jeshimon, but David stayed in the desert. When he realized Saul had come to the desert for him, 
1SA.26.4	 David sent spies to confirm that Saul had arrived.
1SA.26.5	 Then David went to the place where Saul had camped. David saw the place where Saul and Ner’s son Abner, the commander of the army, were lying. Saul was lying in the camp, and the troops were camped around him.
1SA.26.6	 David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai, who was Zeruiah’s son and Joab’s brother, “Who will go with me to Saul in the camp?”
1SA.26.6	Abishai answered, “I’ll go with you.”
1SA.26.7	 So David and Abishai went among ⌊Saul’s⌋ troops that night. Saul was lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him. 
1SA.26.8	 Abishai said to David, “Today God has turned your enemy over to you. Please let me nail him to the ground with one stab of the spear. I won’t have to do it twice!”
1SA.26.9	 “Don’t kill him!” David told Abishai. “No one has ever attacked the L
1SA.26.10	 I solemnly swear, as the L
1SA.26.11	 It would be unthinkable for me to attack the L
1SA.26.12	 David took the spear and the jar of water near Saul’s head, and they left. All of them were asleep. No one saw them, knew about it, or woke up. The L
1SA.26.13	 David went over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away. (There was a wide space between them.) 
1SA.26.14	 Then David called to the troops and to Ner’s son Abner. “Won’t you answer, Abner?” he asked.
1SA.26.14	“Who is calling the king?” Abner asked.
1SA.26.15	 David asked Abner, “Aren’t you a man? Is there anyone like you in Israel? Then why didn’t you guard your master, the king? Someone came to kill His Royal Majesty. 
1SA.26.16	 What you’ve done isn’t good. I solemnly swear, as the L
1SA.26.17	 Saul recognized David’s voice. “Is that your voice, my servant David?” he asked.
1SA.26.17	“It is my voice, Your Royal Majesty,” David answered. 
1SA.26.18	 “Why are you pursuing me?” he added. “What have I done? What crime have I committed? 
1SA.26.19	 Your Majesty, please listen to my words. If the L
1SA.26.20	 Don’t let my blood fall to the ground, away from the L
1SA.26.21	 “My servant David,” Saul said, “I have sinned. Come back. I will not harm you again, because you valued my life today. I’ve acted like a fool and made a terrible mistake.”
1SA.26.22	 David responded, “Here’s the king’s spear. One of the young men should come over and get it. 
1SA.26.23	 The L
1SA.26.24	 As I placed great value on your life today, may the L
1SA.26.25	 Then Saul said, “Blessed are you, my servant David. You will accomplish many things and certainly will succeed.”
1SA.26.25	So David went his way, while Saul returned home.
1SA.27.1	 David said to himself, “One of these days Saul will sweep me away. The best thing for me to do is to make sure that I escape to Philistine territory. Then Saul will give up looking all over Israel for me, and I’ll escape from him.” 
1SA.27.2	 So David went with his 600 men to King Achish of Gath, Moach’s son. 
1SA.27.3	 David and his men stayed with Achish in Gath. Each one had his family, and David had his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail (who had been Nabal’s wife) from Carmel. 
1SA.27.4	 When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he didn’t search for him anymore.
1SA.27.5	 David said to Achish, “If you will permit me, let me have a place in one of the outlying towns so that I can live there. Why should I live in the royal city with you?” 
1SA.27.6	 So Achish immediately gave him Ziklag. (This is why Ziklag still belongs to the kings of Judah today.)
1SA.27.7	 David stayed in Philistine territory for one year and four months. 
1SA.27.8	 Then David and his men went to raid the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (They lived in the territory which extends from Telaim 
1SA.27.9	 Whenever David attacked the territory, he left no man or woman alive. He also took sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing and returned to Achish.
1SA.27.10	 Achish would ask, “Whom did you raid today?” 
1SA.27.10	And David would answer, “the Negev in Judah,” or “the portion of the Negev where the descendants of Jerahmeel live,” or “the portion of the Negev where the Kenites live.” 
1SA.27.11	 He did not bring a single man or woman back to Gath alive. He thought, “They could tell Achish what I ⌊really⌋ did.” This was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory. 
1SA.27.12	 And Achish believed David. Achish thought, “He has definitely made his own people in Israel despise him. He’ll be my servant from now on.”
1SA.28.1	 At that time the Philistines had gathered their army to fight against Israel. Then Achish said to David, “You need to know that you and your men will be going with me into battle.”
1SA.28.2	 “Very well,” David responded to Achish, “you will then know what I can do.”
1SA.28.2	“Very well,” Achish told David, “I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
1SA.28.3	 Meanwhile, Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his hometown Ramah. (Saul had rid the land of mediums and psychics.)
1SA.28.4	 The Philistines assembled and camped in Shunem. Saul also assembled the whole Israelite army, and they camped at Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	 When Saul looked at the Philistine army, he was very afraid—terrified. 
1SA.28.6	 He prayed to the L
1SA.28.7	 Saul told his officers, “Find me a woman who conjures up the dead. Then I’ll go to her and ask for her services.”
1SA.28.7	His officers told him, “There is a woman at Endor who conjures up the dead.”
1SA.28.8	 After disguising himself by putting on other clothes, Saul left with two men and came to the woman that night. He said to her, “Please consult with a dead person for me. Conjure up the person I request.”
1SA.28.9	 The woman told him, “You know that Saul rid the land of mediums and psychics. Why are you trying to trap me and have me killed?”
1SA.28.10	 But Saul took an oath in the L
1SA.28.11	 “Whom should I conjure up for you?” the woman asked.
1SA.28.11	“Conjure up Samuel for me,” he answered.
1SA.28.12	 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out loudly and asked, “Why did you deceive me? You’re Saul!”
1SA.28.13	 “Don’t be afraid,” the king said to her. “What do you see?”
1SA.28.13	“I see a god rising from the ground,” the woman answered.
1SA.28.14	 “In what form?” he asked her.
1SA.28.14	She answered, “An old man is coming up, and he’s wearing a robe.” Then Saul knew it was Samuel. Saul knelt down with his face touching the ground.
1SA.28.15	 Samuel asked Saul, “Why did you disturb me by conjuring me up?”
1SA.28.15	Saul answered, “I’m in serious trouble. The Philistines are at war with me, and God has turned against me and doesn’t answer me anymore—either by the prophets or in dreams. So I’ve called on you to tell me what to do.”
1SA.28.16	 Samuel said, “Why are you asking me when the L
1SA.28.17	 The L
1SA.28.18	 The L
1SA.28.19	 For the same reasons the L
1SA.28.20	 Immediately, Saul fell flat on the ground. He was frightened by Samuel’s words. He also had no strength left, because he hadn’t eaten anything all day or all night. 
1SA.28.21	 The woman came over to Saul and saw that he was terrified. “I listened to you,” she told him, “and I took my life in my hands when I did what you told me to do. 
1SA.28.22	 Now please listen to me. I will serve you something to eat. Eat it so that you will have strength when you leave.”
1SA.28.23	 But he refused. “I don’t want to eat,” he said. Nevertheless, his officers and the woman kept urging 
1SA.28.24	 The woman immediately butchered a fattened calf that she owned. She took flour, kneaded it, and baked some unleavened bread. 
1SA.28.25	 Then she served it to Saul and his officers. They ate and left that ⌊same⌋ night.
1SA.29.1	 The Philistines assembled their whole army at Aphek, and Israel camped at the spring in Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	 The Philistine leaders were marching by with their companies and regiments. David and his men were marching in the rear with Achish.
1SA.29.3	 The Philistine officers asked, “What are these Hebrews doing here?”
1SA.29.3	Achish asked the Philistine officers, “Isn’t this David, the servant of King Saul of Israel, who has been with me now for a year or two? I’ve found nothing wrong with him from the day he defected until now.”
1SA.29.4	 But the Philistine officers were angry with Achish. “Send the man back,” the Philistine officers told him. “Return him to the place you assigned him. He shouldn’t go with us into battle. He shouldn’t ⌊be allowed to⌋ become our enemy during the battle. Is this man going to try to regain his master’s favor? He’ll do it with the lives of our men! 
1SA.29.5	 Isn’t this David of whom people sing in dances:
1SA.29.5	‘Saul has defeated thousands
1SA.29.5	but David tens of thousands’?”
1SA.29.6	 Then Achish called David and told him, “I solemnly swear, as the L
1SA.29.7	 So leave peacefully without doing anything to displease the Philistine rulers.”
1SA.29.8	 “What have I done?” David asked Achish. “What have you learned about me from the time I came to you until now? Why shouldn’t I fight your enemies, Your Majesty?”
1SA.29.9	 Achish answered David, “I admit that in my judgment you’re as good as God’s Messenger. However, the Philistine officers said, ‘He shouldn’t go into battle with us.’ 
1SA.29.10	 Get up early in the morning with Saul’s servants who came with you, and go to the place I have assigned to you. Don’t worry about the unkind words, because I still approve of you.
1SA.29.11	 Early the next morning David and his men returned to Philistine territory, while the Philistines went to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	 Two days later, when David and his men came to Ziklag, the Amalekites had raided the Negev, including Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it. 
1SA.30.2	 Although they captured the young and old women who were there, they killed no one. Instead, they had taken ⌊the women and other prisoners⌋ and gone away. 
1SA.30.3	 By the time David and his men came to the town, it had been burned down, and their wives, sons, and daughters had been taken captive. 
1SA.30.4	 Then David and his men cried loudly until they didn’t have the strength to cry anymore. 
1SA.30.5	 The Amalekites also captured David’s two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail (who had been Nabal’s wife) from Carmel. 
1SA.30.6	 David was in great distress because the people in their bitterness said he should be stoned. (They were thinking of their sons and daughters. But David found strength in the L
1SA.30.7	 David told the priest Abiathar, Ahimelech’s son, “Please bring me the priestly ephod.” 
1SA.30.8	 Then David asked the L
1SA.30.8	“Pursue them,” the L
1SA.30.9	 So David and his 600 men went to the Besor Valley, where some were left behind. 
1SA.30.10	 David and 400 men went in pursuit, while 200 men who were too exhausted to cross the Besor Valley stayed behind.
1SA.30.11	 David’s men found an Egyptian in the open country and took him to David. They gave him food to eat and water to drink. 
1SA.30.12	 They gave him a slice of fig cake and two bunches of raisins. After he had eaten, he revived. (He hadn’t eaten any food or drunk any water for three whole days.) 
1SA.30.13	 David asked him, “To whom do you belong? Where do you come from?”
1SA.30.13	“I’m an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite,” the young man answered. “My master left me behind because I got sick three days ago. 
1SA.30.14	 We raided the portion of the Negev where the Cherethites live, the territory of Judah, the portion of the Negev where Caleb settled, and we burned down Ziklag.”
1SA.30.15	 “Will you lead me to these troops?” David asked him.
1SA.30.15	He answered, “Take an oath in front of God that you won’t kill me or hand me over to my master, and I’ll lead you to these troops.”
1SA.30.16	 The Egyptian led him ⌊to them⌋. They were spread out all over the land, eating, and drinking. They were celebrating because they had taken so much loot from Philistine territory and from the land of Judah. 
1SA.30.17	 From dawn until evening the next day, David attacked them. No one escaped except 400 young men who rode away on camels. 
1SA.30.18	 David rescued everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	 Nothing was missing—young or old, sons or daughters, the loot or anything else they had taken with them. David brought back everything. 
1SA.30.20	 He took all the sheep and the cattle. His men drove the animals ahead of him and said, “This is David’s loot.”
1SA.30.21	 David came to the 200 men who had been too exhausted to go with him and had stayed in the Besor Valley. They came to meet David and the people with him. As David approached the men, he greeted them. 
1SA.30.22	 Then every wicked and worthless man who had gone with David said, “Since they didn’t go with us, they shouldn’t be given any of the loot we recovered. Each of them should take only his wife and children and leave.”
1SA.30.23	 But David said, “My brothers, don’t do that with the things which the L
1SA.30.24	 Besides, who is going to pay attention to what you have to say in this matter? Certainly, the share of those who go into battle must be like the share of those who stay with the supplies. They will all share alike.” 
1SA.30.25	 From that time on he made this a rule and a custom in Israel as it is to this day.
1SA.30.26	 When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the loot to his friends, the leaders of Judah. He said, “Here is a gift for you from the loot ⌊taken from⌋ the L
1SA.30.27	 There were shares for those in Bethel, Ramoth in the Negev, Jattir, 
1SA.30.28	 Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	 Racal, the cities belonging to the Jerahmeelites, the cities belonging to the Kenites, 
1SA.30.30	 Hormah, Borashan, Athach, 
1SA.30.31	 Hebron, and to all the places David and his men visited from time to time.
1SA.31.1	 When the Philistines were fighting against Israel, the men of Israel fled from the Philistines and were killed in battle on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	 The Philistines caught up to Saul and his sons. They killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons. 
1SA.31.3	 The heaviest fighting was against Saul. When the archers got him in their range, he was badly wounded by them.
1SA.31.4	 Saul told his armorbearer, “Draw your sword! Stab me, or these godless men will come, stab me, and make fun of me.” But his armorbearer refused because he was terrified. So Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
1SA.31.5	 When the armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	 So Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men died together that day.
1SA.31.7	 When the people of Israel on the other side of the valley and across the Jordan River saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities. So the Philistines came to live in these cities.
1SA.31.8	 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons lying on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	 They cut off his head and stripped off his armor. Then they sent men throughout Philistine territory to tell the people this good news in their idols’ temples. 
1SA.31.10	 They put his armor in the temple of their goddesses—the Asherahs—and fastened his corpse to the wall of Beth Shan.
1SA.31.11	 When the people living in Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	 all the fighting men marched all night and took the dead bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan. They came back to Jabesh and burned the bodies there. 
1SA.31.13	 They took the bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh. Then they fasted seven days.
2SA.1.1	 After Saul died and David returned from defeating the Amalekites,
2SA.1.2	 On the third day a man came from Saul’s camp. His clothes were torn, and he had dirt on his head. When he came to David, he immediately bowed down with his face touching the ground.
2SA.1.3	 “Where did you come from?” David asked him.
2SA.1.3	“I escaped from the camp of Israel,” he answered.
2SA.1.4	 “What happened?” David asked him. “Please tell me.”
2SA.1.4	The man answered, “The army fled from the battle, and many of the soldiers died. Saul and his son Jonathan are dead too.”
2SA.1.5	 “How do you know Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” David asked the young man who had brought him the news.
2SA.1.6	 The young man answered, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa. Saul was there leaning on his spear, and the chariots and horsemen were catching up with him. 
2SA.1.7	 When he looked back and saw me, he called to me, and I said, ‘Yes?’ ”
2SA.1.8	 “He asked me, ‘Who are you?’
2SA.1.8	“I said to him, ‘I’m an Amalekite.’
2SA.1.9	 “He said to me, ‘Please stand over me and kill me. I’m alive, but I’m suffering.’ 
2SA.1.10	 “So I stood over him and killed him, since I knew he couldn’t survive after he had been wounded. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm and brought them here to you, sir.”
2SA.1.11	 Then David grabbed his own clothes and tore them in grief. All the men with him did the same. 
2SA.1.12	 They mourned, cried, and fasted until evening because Saul, his son Jonathan, the L
2SA.1.13	 David asked the young man who had brought him the news, “Where are you from?”
2SA.1.13	And the young man answered, “I’m an Amalekite, the son of a foreign resident.”
2SA.1.14	 David asked, “Why weren’t you afraid to take it upon yourself to destroy the L
2SA.1.15	 Then David called one of ⌊his⌋ young men and told him, “Come here and attack him.” David’s young man executed him 
2SA.1.16	 while David said, “You are responsible for spilling your own blood. You testified against yourself when you said, ‘I killed the L
2SA.1.17	 David wrote this song of mourning for Saul and his son Jonathan. 
2SA.1.18	 He said,
2SA.1.18	“Teach this 
2SA.1.18	(It is recorded in the Book of Jashar.)
2SA.1.19	 “Your glory, Israel, lies dead on your hills.
2SA.1.19	See how the mighty have fallen!
2SA.1.20	 Don’t tell the news in Gath.
2SA.1.20	Don’t announce the victory in the streets of Ashkelon,
2SA.1.20	or the daughters of the Philistines will be glad,
2SA.1.20	and the daughters of godless men will celebrate.
2SA.1.21	 You mountains in Gilboa,
2SA.1.21	may there be no dew or rain on you
2SA.1.21	or on your slopes,
2SA.1.21	because warriors’ shields were tarnished there.
2SA.1.21	Saul’s shield was never rubbed with olive oil.
2SA.1.22	 From the blood of those killed and the fat of the warriors,
2SA.1.22	Jonathan’s bow did not turn away,
2SA.1.22	nor did Saul’s sword return unused.
2SA.1.23	 Saul and Jonathan were loved and well-liked while they were living.
2SA.1.23	They were not separated even when they died.
2SA.1.23	They were swifter than eagles and stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	 Daughters of Israel, cry over Saul,
2SA.1.24	who dressed you in decorated, red clothes,
2SA.1.24	who put gold jewelry on your clothes.
2SA.1.25	 See how the mighty have fallen in battle!
2SA.1.25	On your hills Jonathan was killed!
2SA.1.26	 I am heartbroken over you, my brother Jonathan.
2SA.1.26	You were my great delight.
2SA.1.26	Your love was more wonderful to me than the love of women.
2SA.1.27	 See how the mighty have fallen!
2SA.1.27	See how the weapons of war have been destroyed!”
2SA.2.1	 After this, David asked the L
2SA.2.1	“Go,” the L
2SA.2.1	“Where should I go?” David asked.
2SA.2.1	“To Hebron,” the L
2SA.2.2	 David went there with his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail (who had been Nabal’s wife) from Carmel. 
2SA.2.3	 David took his men and their families with him, and they settled in the towns around Hebron. 
2SA.2.4	 Then the people of Judah came to Hebron and anointed David to be king over the tribe of Judah.
2SA.2.4	They told David, “The people of Jabesh Gilead were the ones who buried Saul.” 
2SA.2.5	 So David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh Gilead. He said to them, “May the L
2SA.2.6	 May the L
2SA.2.7	 Now, be strong and courageous. Because your master Saul is dead, the tribe of Judah has anointed me to be their king.”
2SA.2.8	 Ner’s son Abner, commander of Saul’s army, took Saul’s son Ishbosheth 
2SA.2.9	 Abner made him king of Gilead, Asher,
2SA.2.10	 Saul’s son Ishbosheth was 40 years old when he became king of Israel. He ruled for two years, but the tribe of Judah followed David. 
2SA.2.11	 In Hebron David was king over the tribe of Judah for seven years and six months.
2SA.2.12	 Ner’s son Abner and the officers of Saul’s son Ishbosheth went from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	 Zeruiah’s son Joab and David’s officers also left ⌊Hebron⌋. Both groups met at the pool of Gibeon. They sat down there, one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the other side of the pool.
2SA.2.14	 Abner said to Joab, “Let’s have the young men hold a contest.” Joab agreed.
2SA.2.15	 The men got up and were counted as they passed by. Twelve were from the tribe of Benjamin (representing Saul’s son Ishbosheth), and twelve were from David’s officers. 
2SA.2.16	 Each one grabbed his opponent by the head, stuck his sword into his opponent’s side, and they fell down together. Therefore, that place in Gibeon is called the Field of Enemies. 
2SA.2.17	 Fierce fighting broke out that day, and David’s men defeated Abner and the men of Israel.
2SA.2.18	 Zeruiah’s three sons were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as fast on his feet as a wild gazelle. 
2SA.2.19	 He chased Abner and refused to leave him alone. 
2SA.2.20	 When Abner looked back, he asked, “Are you Asahel?”
2SA.2.20	“Yes,” Asahel answered.
2SA.2.21	 Abner told him, “Leave me alone! Catch one of the young men, and take his weapon.” 
2SA.2.21	But Asahel refused to turn away from him. 
2SA.2.22	 So Abner spoke again to Asahel. “Stop following me,” he said. “Why should I kill you? How could I look your brother Joab in the face again?”
2SA.2.23	 But Asahel refused to turn away. So Abner struck him with the butt of the spear. The spear went into his belly and came out his back. He fell down there and died on the spot. And everyone who came to the place where Asahel fell and died stopped there.
2SA.2.24	 But Joab and Abishai chased Abner. When the sun went down, they came to the hill of Ammah, opposite Giah on the road from Gibeon to the desert. 
2SA.2.25	 The men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner, banding together and taking their position on top of a hill.
2SA.2.26	 Then Abner called to Joab, “Should this slaughter go on forever? Don’t you know this will end in bitterness? How long will it be before you will call off your troops from chasing their relatives?”
2SA.2.27	 Joab answered, “I solemnly swear, as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would not have stopped chasing their relatives until morning.” 
2SA.2.28	 So Joab blew a ram’s horn, and all the troops stopped. They didn’t chase or fight Israel anymore.
2SA.2.29	 Abner and his men marched through the plains all that night. They crossed the Jordan River and passed through the entire Bithron until they came to Mahanaim.
2SA.2.30	 Joab returned from chasing Abner. When he had gathered all the troops, ⌊only⌋ 19 of David’s officers and Asahel were missing. 
2SA.2.31	 However, David’s officers had killed 360 of the men of Benjamin under Abner’s command. 
2SA.2.32	 They took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.
2SA.3.1	 As the war between the royal families of Saul and David dragged on, David’s family became stronger and stronger, and Saul’s family became weaker and weaker.
2SA.3.2	 Sons were born to David while he was in Hebron. His first son was Amnon, ⌊born⌋ to Ahinoam from Jezreel. 
2SA.3.3	 The second was Chileab, ⌊born⌋ to Abigail (who had been Nabal’s wife) from Carmel. The third was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah (the daughter of King Talmai) from Geshur. 
2SA.3.4	 The fourth was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith. The fifth was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital. 
2SA.3.5	 The sixth was Ithream, ⌊born⌋ to David’s wife Eglah. These sons were born to David while he was in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	 During the war between the families of Saul and David, Abner strengthened his position in Saul’s royal family. 
2SA.3.7	 Saul had a concubine 
2SA.3.8	 Ishbosheth’s question made Abner very angry. “Have I been behaving like some Judean dog?” 
2SA.3.9	 May God strike me dead unless I do for David what the L
2SA.3.10	 ‘I, the L
2SA.3.11	 Ishbosheth couldn’t respond to a single word, because he was afraid of Abner.
2SA.3.12	 Then Abner sent messengers to David to speak on his behalf. “Who owns this country?” he asked. “Make an agreement with me,” he said. “I’ll support you and bring all Israel to you.”
2SA.3.13	 “Good!” David answered. “I’ll make an agreement with you. But there’s one condition: You can’t come to see me unless you bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come.”
2SA.3.14	 Then David sent messengers to Saul’s son Ishbosheth to say, “Give me my wife Michal. I made a payment of 100 Philistine foreskins for her.”
2SA.3.15	 So Ishbosheth sent men to take her from her husband Paltiel, son of Laish. 
2SA.3.16	 Her husband went with her and cried over her all the way to Bahurim. “Go home,” Abner told him. So he went home.
2SA.3.17	 Meanwhile, Abner sent the following message to the leaders of Israel: “For some time now you’ve wanted to make David your king. 
2SA.3.18	 Do it now, because the L
2SA.3.19	 Abner also spoke specifically to the people of Benjamin.
2SA.3.19	Then Abner went directly to David in Hebron to tell him everything Israel and the entire tribe of Benjamin had approved. 
2SA.3.20	 So Abner came with 20 men to David in Hebron, and David had a feast for Abner and his men.
2SA.3.21	 Abner told David, “I must go now so that I can gather all Israel for you, Your Majesty. They will make a treaty with you, and you will rule everything your heart desires.” Then David dismissed Abner, who left peacefully.
2SA.3.22	 Just then David’s men and Joab were coming home from a raid with a lot of goods. Abner had been dismissed, so he was no longer with David in Hebron. 
2SA.3.23	 When Joab came back with the whole army, he was told, “Ner’s son Abner came to the king, but David dismissed him, and Abner left peacefully.”
2SA.3.24	 Then Joab went to the king and asked, “What have you done? Abner came to see you. Why did you dismiss him and let him get away? 
2SA.3.25	 Certainly you must know that Ner’s son Abner came to deceive you, to find out about your movements and learn everything you’re doing!”
2SA.3.26	 After leaving David, Joab sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the cistern of Sirah without David knowing about it. 
2SA.3.27	 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gateway as if to talk to him privately. There he stabbed Abner in the belly. Abner died because he spilled the blood of Joab’s brother Asahel.
2SA.3.28	 Later when David heard about it, he said, “As far as the L
2SA.3.29	 May the blame fall on the head of Joab and all of his family. May there always be members of Joab’s family who have oozing sores and skin diseases, who can only work a spindle,
2SA.3.30	 (Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)
2SA.3.31	 David told Joab and all the people with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn for Abner.” King David followed the open casket. 
2SA.3.32	 They buried Abner in Hebron. The king cried loudly at Abner’s grave, and all the people cried. 
2SA.3.33	 The king sang a funeral song for Abner:
2SA.3.33	Should Abner die like a godless fool?
2SA.3.34	 Your hands were not tied.
2SA.3.34	Your feet were not chained.
2SA.3.34	You fell as one falls in front of wicked men.
2SA.3.34	And all the people continued to cry for him.
2SA.3.35	 That entire day all the people tried to get David to eat some food. But David had taken an oath: “May God strike me dead if I taste any food or anything else before the sun goes down.” 
2SA.3.36	 Then all the people understood and approved of this, as all the people approved of everything the king did. 
2SA.3.37	 That day all the people of Israel knew the king wasn’t responsible for killing Ner’s son Abner. 
2SA.3.38	 The king said to his officers, “Don’t you know that today a leader, a great man, has fallen in Israel? 
2SA.3.39	 Today I’m weak, though I’m the anointed king. These men, Zeruiah’s sons, are too cruel for me. May the L
2SA.4.1	 When Saul’s son Ishbosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost his courage, and all Israel was alarmed. 
2SA.4.2	 Saul’s son had two men who were captains of raiding parties. One was named Baanah, and the other was named Rechab. They were the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth from the tribe of Benjamin.
2SA.4.2	(Beeroth was considered a part of Benjamin, 
2SA.4.3	 even though the people of Beeroth had fled to Gittaim. They still live there today. 
2SA.4.4	 In addition, Saul’s son Jonathan had a son who was crippled. When the boy was five years old, the news about ⌊the death of⌋ Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled ⌊to Gittaim⌋. She was in a hurry when she left, and he fell ⌊from her arms⌋ and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.)
2SA.4.5	 Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth, came to Ishbosheth’s home at the hottest time of the day. Ishbosheth was taking his midday nap 
2SA.4.6	 when they came into the house as though they were going to get some flour. Instead, they stabbed him in the belly. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped. 
2SA.4.7	 (They had come into the house while Ishbosheth was sleeping on his bed in his bedroom. They stabbed him, killed him, and cut off his head.) They took his head and traveled all night along the road to the plains.
2SA.4.8	 They brought Ishbosheth’s head to David at Hebron. “Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul who tried to kill you,” they told the king. “Today the L
2SA.4.9	 David responded to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth, 
2SA.4.10	 “I once seized a man who told me that Saul had died. He thought he was bringing good news. I killed him in Ziklag to reward him for his news. 
2SA.4.11	 How much more ⌊should I reward⌋ wicked men who kill an innocent man on his own bed in his home? The L
2SA.4.12	 So David gave an order to his young men, who executed Rechab and Baanah, cut off their hands and feet, and hung their dead bodies by the pond in Hebron. Then they took Ishbosheth’s head and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.
2SA.5.1	 All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron. “We are your own flesh and blood,” they said. 
2SA.5.2	 “Even in the past when Saul ruled us, you were the one who led Israel in battle. The L
2SA.5.3	 All the leaders of Israel had come to Hebron. King David made an agreement with them at Hebron in front of the L
2SA.5.4	 David was 30 years old when he became king, and he ruled for 40 years. 
2SA.5.5	 In Hebron he ruled Judah for seven years and six months. In Jerusalem he ruled for 33 years over all Israel and Judah.
2SA.5.6	 The king and his men went to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived in that region. The Jebusites told David, “You will never get in here. Even the blind and the lame could turn you away” (meaning that David could never get in there). 
2SA.5.7	 But David captured the fortress Zion (that is, the City of David). 
2SA.5.8	 That day David said, “Whoever wants to defeat the Jebusites must reach the lame and the blind who hate me by using the water shaft.” So there is a saying, “The blind and the lame will not get into the palace.” 
2SA.5.9	 David lived in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built the city ⌊of Jerusalem⌋ around it from the Millo 
2SA.5.10	 David continued to grow more powerful because the L
2SA.5.11	 Then King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedarwood, carpenters, and stonemasons. They built a palace for David. 
2SA.5.12	 So David realized that the L
2SA.5.13	 David married more concubines 
2SA.5.14	 These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of Israel, all of them came to attack David. But David heard about it and went to the fortress. 
2SA.5.18	 The Philistines had come and overrun the valley of Rephaim.
2SA.5.19	 David asked the L
2SA.5.19	The L
2SA.5.20	 So David went to Baal Perazim and defeated the Philistines there. He said, “The L
2SA.5.21	 The Philistines left their idols there, so David and his men carried the idols away.
2SA.5.22	 The Philistines again attacked and overran the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.23	 David asked the L
2SA.5.24	 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, act immediately because the L
2SA.5.25	 David did as the L
2SA.6.1	 David again assembled all the best soldiers in Israel, 30,000 men. 
2SA.6.2	 He and all the people with him left Baalah in Judah 
2SA.6.3	 David and his men put God’s ark on a new cart and brought it from Abinadab’s home on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab’s sons, were guiding the new cart. 
2SA.6.4	 They brought it from Abinadab’s home, with Ahio walking ahead of the ark. 
2SA.6.5	 David and the entire nation of Israel were celebrating in the L
2SA.6.6	 But when they came to Nacon’s threshing floor,
2SA.6.7	 The L
2SA.6.8	 David was angry because the L
2SA.6.9	 David was afraid of the L
2SA.6.10	 So David wouldn’t bring the ark of the L
2SA.6.11	 The ark of the L
2SA.6.12	 King David was told, “The L
2SA.6.13	 When those who carried the ark of the L

2SA.6.15	 He and the entire nation of Israel brought the ark of the L
2SA.6.16	 When the ark of the L
2SA.6.17	 The men carrying the ark set it in its place inside the tent David had put up for it. David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in the L
2SA.6.18	 When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the L
2SA.6.19	 He also distributed to all the people—to the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women—one loaf of bread, one date cake, and one raisin cake. Then all the people went home.
2SA.6.20	 When David returned to bless his family, Saul’s daughter Michal came out to meet him. “How dignified Israel’s king was today! He was exposing himself before the eyes of the slave girls of his palace staff—like a mindless fool might expose himself!”
2SA.6.21	 David answered Michal, “⌊I didn’t dance in front of the slave girls but⌋ in front of the L
2SA.6.22	 and I will degrade myself even more than this. Even if I am humiliated in your eyes, I will be honored by these slave girls you speak about.”
2SA.6.23	 So Saul’s daughter Michal was childless her entire life.
2SA.7.1	 While King David was living in his house, the L
2SA.7.2	 So the king said to the prophet Nathan, “Look, I’m living in a house made of cedar, while the ark of God remains in the tent.”
2SA.7.3	 Nathan told the king, “Do everything you have in mind, because the L
2SA.7.4	 But that same night the L

2SA.7.6	 I haven’t lived in a house from the day I took Israel out of Egypt to this day. Instead, I moved around in a tent, the tent ⌊of meeting⌋.

2SA.7.14	 I will be his Father, and he will be my Son. If he sins, I will punish him with a rod and with blows inflicted by people. 
2SA.7.15	 But I will never stop showing him my love as I did to Saul, whom I took out of your way. 
2SA.7.16	 Your royal house will remain in my presence 
2SA.7.17	 Nathan told David all these words and everything he had seen.
2SA.7.18	 King David went into the tent and sat in front of the L
2SA.7.19	 And even this you consider to be a small act, Almighty L
2SA.7.20	 “What more can I, David, say to you, Almighty L

2SA.8.1	 After this, David defeated and crushed the Philistines. He took control of the main Philistine city from them.
2SA.8.2	 He also defeated Moab, made the Moabites lie down on the ground, and measured them with a rope. He measured two lengths which were to be killed, and one length which was to be spared. So the Moabites became David’s subjects and paid taxes ⌊to him⌋.
2SA.8.3	 When David went to restore his control ⌊over the territory⌋ along the Euphrates River, he defeated Zobah’s King Hadadezer, son of Rehob. 
2SA.8.4	 David took 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers from him. David also disabled all but 100 of their horses so that they couldn’t pull chariots.
2SA.8.5	 When the Arameans from Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David killed 22,000 of them. 
2SA.8.6	 David put troops in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became his subjects and paid taxes ⌊to him⌋. Everywhere David went, the L
2SA.8.7	 David took the gold shields that belonged to Hadadezer’s 
2SA.8.8	 King David also took a large quantity of bronze from Betah and Berothai, Hadadezer’s cities.
2SA.8.9	 When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated Hadadezer’s whole army, 
2SA.8.10	 he sent his son Joram to greet King David and congratulate him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer. (There had often been war between Hadadezer and Toi.) Joram brought articles of gold, silver, and bronze with him. 
2SA.8.11	 King David dedicated these articles to the L
2SA.8.12	 from Edom, Moab, Ammon, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the goods taken from Zobah’s King Hadadezer, son of Rehob.
2SA.8.13	 David made a name for himself by killing 18,000 Edomites 
2SA.8.14	 He put troops everywhere in Edom, and all the Edomites were David’s subjects. Everywhere David went, the L
2SA.8.15	 So David ruled all Israel. He did what was fair and right for all his people. 
2SA.8.16	 Zeruiah’s son Joab was in charge of the army. Ahilud’s son Jehoshaphat was the royal historian. 
2SA.8.17	 Ahitub’s son Zadok and Abiathar’s son Ahimelech were priests. Seraiah was the royal scribe. 
2SA.8.18	 Jehoiada’s son Benaiah was commander of the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And David’s sons were priests.
2SA.9.1	 David asked, “Is there anyone left in Saul’s family to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”
2SA.9.2	 Now, Saul’s family had a servant whose name was Ziba. He was summoned to ⌊come to⌋ David. “Are you Ziba?” the king asked him.
2SA.9.2	“⌊Yes,⌋ I am,” he answered.
2SA.9.3	 David asked, “Is there someone left in Saul’s family to whom I can show God’s kindness?”
2SA.9.3	“Jonathan has a son who is disabled,” Ziba answered.
2SA.9.4	 “Where is he?” the king asked.
2SA.9.4	Ziba replied, “He is at the home of Machir, Ammiel’s son, in Lo Debar.”
2SA.9.5	 So King David sent men to get him from the home of Ammiel’s son Machir in Lo Debar. 
2SA.9.6	 When Mephibosheth (son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul) came to David, he quickly bowed down with his face touching the ground.
2SA.9.6	“Mephibosheth!” David said to him.
2SA.9.6	“Yes, sir,” he answered.
2SA.9.7	 “Don’t be afraid,” David told him, “I will certainly show you kindness for your father Jonathan’s sake. I will give back to you all the land of your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.”
2SA.9.8	 Mephibosheth bowed down ⌊again⌋ and answered, “Who am I that you would look at a dead dog like me?”
2SA.9.9	 Then the king called for Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “I have given your master’s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family. 
2SA.9.10	 You, your sons, and your servants should farm the land for him and harvest ⌊the crops⌋ so that your master’s family will have food to eat. However, your master’s grandson Mephibosheth will always eat at my table.” (Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants.)
2SA.9.11	 Ziba responded, “I will do everything you’ve commanded, Your Majesty.” From then on, Mephibosheth ate at David’s table as one of the king’s sons.
2SA.9.12	 Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. Everyone who lived at Ziba’s home became Mephibosheth’s servant. 
2SA.9.13	 However, Mephibosheth, who was disabled, lived in Jerusalem. He always ate at the king’s table.
2SA.10.1	 Later the king of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king in his place. 
2SA.10.2	 David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun as his father Nahash showed me kindness.” So David sent his servants to comfort Hanun after his father’s ⌊death⌋. But when David’s servants entered Ammon ite territory, 
2SA.10.3	 the Ammon ite princes asked their master Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father because he sent men to comfort you? Hasn’t David sent his men to explore the city, spy on it, and destroy it?” 
2SA.10.4	 So Hanun took David’s men, shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their clothes from the waist down, and sent them away.
2SA.10.5	 After David was told ⌊what had happened⌋, he sent ⌊someone⌋ to meet them because they were deeply humiliated. The king said to them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return ⌊to Jerusalem⌋.”
2SA.10.6	 The Ammonites realized that they had made themselves offensive to David. So they hired the Arameans from Beth Rehob and Zobah (20,000 foot soldiers), ⌊the army of⌋ the king of Maacah (1,000 men), and the men of Tob (12,000 men).
2SA.10.7	 After David heard about this, he sent Joab and all the elite troops. 
2SA.10.8	 The Ammonites formed a battle line at the entrance of the ⌊city⌋ gate, while the Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the men from Tob and Maacah remained by themselves in the open country.
2SA.10.9	 When Joab saw he was under attack in front and behind, he took the select troops of Israel and organized them for combat against the Arameans. 
2SA.10.10	 He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the troops. Abishai organized them for combat against the Ammonites.
2SA.10.11	 Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for my ⌊troops⌋, be ready to help me. And if the Ammonites are too strong for your ⌊troops⌋, I’ll come to help you. 
2SA.10.12	 Be strong! Let’s prove ourselves strong for our people and for the cities of our God, and the L
2SA.10.13	 Then Joab and his troops advanced to fight the Arameans, and the Arameans fled. 
2SA.10.14	 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, the Ammonites fled from Abishai and went into the city. So Joab stopped his campaign against the Ammonites and returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	 Realizing that Israel had defeated them, the Arameans reassembled ⌊their troops⌋. 
2SA.10.16	 Hadadezer sent ⌊messengers⌋ to get Arameans from beyond the Euphrates River. The Arameans came to Helam with Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army, leading them.
2SA.10.17	 When David was told ⌊about this⌋, he assembled Israel’s army, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Helam. The Arameans formed a battle line against David’s ⌊troops⌋ and fought him. 
2SA.10.18	 The Arameans fled from Israel, and David killed 700 chariot drivers and 40,000 horsemen. David struck Shobach dead.
2SA.10.19	 When all the kings who were subject to Hadadezer saw that Israel had defeated them, they made peace with Israel and became their subjects. And the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.
2SA.11.1	 In the spring, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, his mercenaries, and Israel’s army ⌊to war⌋. They destroyed the Ammonites and attacked Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem.
2SA.11.2	 Now, when evening came, David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the royal palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing, and she was very pretty. 
2SA.11.3	 David sent someone to ask about the woman. The man said, “She’s Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite.” 
2SA.11.4	 So David sent messengers and took her. She came to him, and he went to bed with her. (She had just cleansed herself after her monthly period.) Then she went home. 
2SA.11.5	 The woman had become pregnant. So she sent someone to tell David that she was pregnant.
2SA.11.6	 Then David sent a messenger to Joab, saying, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent Uriah to David. 
2SA.11.7	 When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab and the troops were and how the war was going.
2SA.11.8	 “Go home,” David said to Uriah, “and wash your feet.” Uriah left the royal palace, and the king sent a present to him. 
2SA.11.9	 But Uriah slept at the entrance of the royal palace among his superior’s mercenaries. He didn’t go home.
2SA.11.10	 When they told David, “Uriah didn’t go home,” David asked Uriah, “Didn’t you just come from a journey? Why didn’t you go home?”
2SA.11.11	 Uriah answered David, “The ark and ⌊the army of⌋ Israel and Judah are in temporary shelters, and my commander Joab and Your Majesty’s mercenaries are living in the field. Should I then go to my house to eat and drink and go to bed with my wife? I solemnly swear, as sure as you’re living, I won’t do this!”
2SA.11.12	 David said to Uriah, “Then stay here today, and tomorrow I’ll send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
2SA.11.13	 David summoned him, ate and drank with him, and got him drunk. But that evening Uriah went to lie down on his bed among his superior’s mercenaries. He didn’t go home.
2SA.11.14	 In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. 
2SA.11.15	 In the letter he wrote, “Put Uriah on the front line where the fighting is heaviest. Then abandon him so that he’ll be struck down and die.”
2SA.11.16	 Since Joab had kept the city under observation, he put Uriah at the place where he knew the experienced warriors were. 
2SA.11.17	 The men of the city came out and fought Joab. Some of the people, namely, some of David’s mercenaries, fell and died—including Uriah the Hittite.
2SA.11.18	 Then Joab sent ⌊a messenger⌋ to report to David all the details of the battle. 
2SA.11.19	 And he commanded the messenger, “When you finish telling the king about the battle, 
2SA.11.20	 the king may become angry. He might ask you, ‘Why did you go so close to the city to fight? Didn’t you know they would shoot from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	 Who killed Jerubbesheth’s 
2SA.11.22	 The messenger left, and when he arrived, he reported to David everything Joab told him to say.
2SA.11.23	 The messenger said, “Their men overpowered us and came to attack us in the field. Then we forced them back to the entrance of the city gate. 
2SA.11.24	 The archers on the wall shot down at your mercenaries, and some of Your Majesty’s mercenaries died. Your man Uriah the Hittite also is dead.”
2SA.11.25	 David said to the messenger, “This is what you are to say to Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing trouble you, because a sword can kill one person as easily as another. Strengthen your attack against the city, and destroy it.’ Say this to encourage him.”
2SA.11.26	 When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned for him. 
2SA.11.27	 When her mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to his home, and she became his wife. Then she gave birth to a son. But the L
2SA.12.1	 So the L
2SA.12.2	 The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cows, 
2SA.12.3	 but the poor man had only one little female lamb that he had bought. He raised her, and she grew up in his home with his children. She would eat his food and drink from his cup. She rested in his arms and was like a daughter.
2SA.12.4	 “Now, a visitor came to the rich man. The rich man thought it would be a pity to take one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler. So he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared her for the traveler.”
2SA.12.5	 David burned with anger against the man. “I solemnly swear, as the L
2SA.12.6	 And he must pay back four times the price of the lamb because he did this and had no pity.”
2SA.12.7	 “You are the man!” Nathan told David. “This is what the L
2SA.12.8	 I gave you your master Saul’s house and his wives. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if this weren’t enough, I would have given you even more. 
2SA.12.9	 Why did you despise my word by doing what I considered evil? You had Uriah the Hittite killed in battle. You took his wife as your wife. You used the Ammonites to kill him. 
2SA.12.10	 So warfare will never leave your house because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
2SA.12.11	 “This is what the L
2SA.12.12	 You did this secretly, but I will make this happen in broad daylight in front of all Israel.”
2SA.12.13	 Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the L
2SA.12.13	Nathan replied, “The L
2SA.12.14	 But since you have shown total contempt for the L
2SA.12.15	 Then Nathan went home.
2SA.12.15	The L
2SA.12.16	 David pleaded with God for the child; he fasted and lay on the ground all night. 
2SA.12.17	 The older leaders in his palace stood beside him to raise him up from the ground, but he was unwilling. And he wouldn’t eat with them.
2SA.12.18	 On the seventh day the child died. But David’s officials were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. They thought, “While the child was alive, we talked to him, and he wouldn’t listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may harm ⌊himself⌋.”
2SA.12.19	 But when David saw that his officials were whispering to one another, he realized that the child was dead. “Is the child dead?” David asked them.
2SA.12.19	“⌊Yes,⌋ he is dead,” they answered.
2SA.12.20	 So David got up from the ground, bathed, anointed himself, and changed his clothes. He went into the L
2SA.12.21	 His officials asked him, “Why are you acting this way? You fasted and cried over the child when he was alive. But as soon as the child died, you got up and ate.”
2SA.12.22	 David answered, “As long as the child was alive, I fasted and cried. I thought, ‘Who knows? The L
2SA.12.23	 But why should I fast now that he’s dead? Can I bring him back? ⌊Someday⌋ I’ll go to him, but he won’t come back to me.”
2SA.12.24	 Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He went to bed with her, and she later gave birth to a son. David named him Solomon. The L
2SA.12.25	 and sent a message through the prophet Nathan to name the baby Jedidiah [The L
2SA.12.26	 Meanwhile, Joab fought against the Ammon ite city of Rabbah and captured its royal fortress. 
2SA.12.27	 So he sent messengers to tell David, “I fought against Rabbah and captured the fortress guarding its water supply. 
2SA.12.28	 Gather the rest of the troops, surround the city, and capture it. Otherwise, I will capture the city, and it will be named after me.”
2SA.12.29	 So David gathered all the troops and went to Rabbah. He fought against the city and captured it. 
2SA.12.30	 He took the gold crown from the head of Rabbah’s king and put it on his own head. (The crown weighed 75 pounds and contained a precious stone.) David also took a lot of goods from the city. 
2SA.12.31	 He brought out the troops who were there and put them to work with saws, hoes, and axes. He did the same to all the Ammon ite cities. Then David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.13.1	 After this, David’s son Amnon fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of David’s son Absalom. 
2SA.13.2	 Amnon was so obsessed with his half sister Tamar that he made himself sick. It seemed impossible for him to be alone with her because she was a virgin.
2SA.13.3	 Amnon had a friend by the name of Jonadab, a son of David’s brother Shimea. Jonadab was a very clever man. 
2SA.13.4	 He asked Amnon, “Why are you, the king’s son, so worn out morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?”
2SA.13.4	“I’m in love with Absalom’s sister Tamar,” he answered.
2SA.13.5	 Then Jonadab told him, “Lie down on your bed. Act sick, and when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come to feed me. She can prepare a meal in front of me as I watch her, and she can feed me.’ ”
2SA.13.6	 So Amnon lay down and acted sick, and the king came to see him. Amnon asked the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make some bread in front of me, and she can feed me.”
2SA.13.7	 David sent for Tamar at the palace. “Please go to your brother Amnon’s home,” he said, “and prepare some food for him.”
2SA.13.8	 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s home. He was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made flat bread in front of him, and cooked it. 
2SA.13.9	 Then she took the pan and served him ⌊the bread⌋. But he refused to eat.
2SA.13.9	“Have everyone leave me,” he said. So everyone left him.
2SA.13.10	 Amnon told Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom so that you can feed me.”
2SA.13.10	Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in the bedroom. 
2SA.13.11	 When she handed it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me, Tamar!”
2SA.13.12	 “No,” she told him, “don’t rape me! That shouldn’t be done in Israel. Don’t do this godless act! 
2SA.13.13	 Where could I go in my disgrace? And you will be considered one of the godless fools in Israel! Speak to the king. He won’t refuse your request to marry me.”
2SA.13.14	 But Amnon wouldn’t listen to her. He grabbed his sister and raped her.
2SA.13.15	 Now, Amnon developed an intense hatred for her. His hatred for her was greater than the lust he had felt for her. “Get out of here,” he told her.
2SA.13.16	 She said to him, “No, sending me away is a greater wrong than the other thing you did to me!” But he wouldn’t listen to her.
2SA.13.17	 Then he called his personal servant and said, “Get rid of her. Put her out, and bolt the door behind her.” 
2SA.13.18	 (She was wearing a long-sleeved gown. The king’s virgin daughters wore this kind of robe.) So his servant took her out and bolted the door behind her. 
2SA.13.19	 Tamar put ashes on her head, tore the long-sleeved gown she had on, put her hands on her head, and went away crying.
2SA.13.20	 Her brother Absalom asked her, “Has your brother Amnon been with you? Sister, be quiet for now. He’s your brother. Don’t dwell on this matter.” So Tamar stayed there at the home of her brother Absalom and was depressed.
2SA.13.21	 When King David heard about this, he became very angry. But David didn’t punish his son Amnon. He favored Amnon because he was his firstborn son.
2SA.13.22	 Absalom wouldn’t speak at all to Amnon. He hated Amnon for raping his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	 Two years later Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal Hazor near Ephraim. He invited all the king’s sons.
2SA.13.24	 Absalom went to the king and said, “Since I have sheepshearers, Your Majesty and your officials are invited ⌊to feast⌋ with me.”
2SA.13.25	 “No, Son,” the king answered Absalom. “If we all go, we’ll be a burden to you.” Even when Absalom continued to urge 
2SA.13.26	 So Absalom said, “If you won’t go, then please let my brother Amnon go with us.”
2SA.13.26	“Why should he go with you?” the king asked him. 
2SA.13.27	 But when Absalom urged him, he let Amnon and all ⌊the rest of⌋ the king’s sons go with him.
2SA.13.28	 Then Absalom gave an order to his servants. “Watch now,” he said. “When Amnon begins to feel good from drinking ⌊too much⌋ wine, I’ll tell you, ‘Attack Amnon.’ Then kill him. Don’t be afraid. I’ve given you the order, haven’t I? Be strong and courageous.”
2SA.13.29	 Absalom’s servants did to Amnon as Absalom had ordered. Then all the king’s sons got up, mounted their mules, and fled. 
2SA.13.30	 While they were on their way, David heard this rumor: “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons, and not a single one is left.” 
2SA.13.31	 The king stood up, tore his clothes, and lay down on the ground. All his servants were standing beside him with their clothes torn ⌊to show their grief⌋.
2SA.13.32	 Then Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimea, said, “Sir, don’t think that all the young men, all the king’s sons, have been killed. Only Amnon is dead. Absalom decided to do this the day his half brother raped his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.33	 You shouldn’t burden your heart with the idea that all the king’s sons are dead, Your Majesty. Only Amnon is dead. 
2SA.13.34	 Absalom has fled.”
2SA.13.34	When the servant who kept watch looked up, he saw many people coming down the road beside the mountain west of him. 
2SA.13.35	 Then Jonadab told the king, “The king’s sons have come. It’s just as I said.” 
2SA.13.36	 When he finished speaking, the king’s sons arrived and cried loudly. The king and all his men also cried very bitterly.
2SA.13.37	 Absalom, however, fled to Geshur’s King Talmai, Ammihud’s son. But the king mourned for his son Amnon every day. 
2SA.13.38	 Absalom, having fled to Geshur, stayed there three years. 
2SA.13.39	 King David began to long for Absalom once people had consoled him over Amnon’s death.
2SA.14.1	 Joab, Zeruiah’s son, knew the king was still thinking about Absalom. 
2SA.14.2	 So Joab sent ⌊someone⌋ to Tekoa to get a clever woman from there. He told her, “Please act like a mourner, and dress in mourning clothes. Don’t rub olive oil on yourself,
2SA.14.3	 Go to the king, and tell him this. . . .” Then Joab told her exactly what to say.
2SA.14.4	 The woman from Tekoa came 
2SA.14.5	 The king asked her, “What can I do for you?”
2SA.14.5	She answered, “I’m a widow; my husband is dead. 
2SA.14.6	 I had two sons who quarreled in the field, and there was no one to separate them. One killed the other. 
2SA.14.7	 Then the entire family turned against me. They said, ‘Give us the man who killed his brother so that we can kill him because he took his brother’s life. We’re going to destroy the one who ⌊now⌋ would be the heir.’ In this way they wish to extinguish the ⌊one⌋ burning coal that is left for me. They will not let my husband’s name or descendants remain on the face of the earth.”
2SA.14.8	 “Go home,” the king told the woman. “I will order someone to take care of this matter.”
2SA.14.9	 The woman from Tekoa said to the king, “Let me be held responsible for the sin, Your Majesty. Let my father’s family be held responsible. Your Majesty and your throne are innocent.”
2SA.14.10	 The king said, “If anyone says anything against you, bring him to me. He’ll never harm you again.”
2SA.14.11	 She said, “Your Majesty, please pray to the L
2SA.14.11	“I solemnly swear, as the L
2SA.14.12	 The woman said, “Please let me say something else to you.”
2SA.14.12	“Speak,” he said.
2SA.14.13	 “Why have you devised something like this against God’s people?” she said. “When you say this, you condemn yourself because you haven’t brought back the one you banished! 
2SA.14.14	 We are all going to die; we are all like water that is poured on the ground and can’t be gathered up. But doesn’t God forgive a person? He never plans to keep a banished person in exile.
2SA.14.15	 “I’ve come to say this to you because the people have frightened me. So I thought, ‘I will speak to the king about this. Maybe the king will do something for me, his subject. 
2SA.14.16	 Maybe the king will listen and rescue me, his subject, from the man who wants to cut off both me and my son from ⌊our⌋ God-given inheritance.’ 
2SA.14.17	 I thought that you would reassure me. You are like God’s Messenger, who is able to distinguish right from wrong. May the L
2SA.14.18	 The king said to the woman, “Please don’t refuse to answer the question I’m going to ask you.”
2SA.14.18	The woman responded, “Please speak, Your Majesty.”
2SA.14.19	 “Did Joab put you up to this?” the king asked.
2SA.14.19	The woman answered, “I solemnly swear on your life, Your Majesty, you are absolutely right. Yes, your servant Joab ordered me ⌊to do this⌋. He told me to say exactly what I said. 
2SA.14.20	 Your servant Joab has done this to portray the matter in a different light. You are as wise as God’s Messenger, who knows everything on earth.”
2SA.14.21	 Then the king told Joab, “This is what you’ll do. Bring back the young man Absalom.”
2SA.14.22	 Joab quickly bowed down with his face touching the ground, and he blessed the king. He said, “Today I know that you have been kind to me because you have done what I wanted.”
2SA.14.23	 So Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	 But the king said, “Absalom should return to his own house. He will not see me.” So Absalom returned to his house and didn’t see the king.
2SA.14.25	 Now, no one in all Israel was praised for his good looks as much as Absalom was. He had no blemish from head to toe. 
2SA.14.26	 At the end of every year, he used to cut his hair because it became heavy for him. When he cut the hair on his head and weighed it, it weighed five pounds according to the royal standard. 
2SA.14.27	 Absalom had three sons and one daughter. His daughter Tamar was a beautiful woman.
2SA.14.28	 Absalom stayed in Jerusalem two full years without seeing the king. 
2SA.14.29	 So Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come. Absalom sent for him a second time, but he still refused to come. 
2SA.14.30	 So Absalom said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine. He has barley in it. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set it on fire.
2SA.14.30	Joab’s servants came to him ⌊in grief⌋ and said, “Absalom’s servants have set ⌊your⌋ field on fire.” 
2SA.14.31	 Then Joab immediately went to Absalom at his home. “Why did your servants set my field on fire?” he asked.
2SA.14.32	 Absalom answered Joab, “I sent someone to tell you to come here because I wanted to send you to the king to ask him why I had to come from Geshur. It would be better for me if I were still there. Let me see the king now! If I’m guilty of a sin, he should kill me.”
2SA.14.33	 Joab went to the king and told him this. The king then called for Absalom, who came to the king and bowed down with his face touching the ground. And the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	 Soon after this, Absalom acquired a chariot, horses, and 50 men to run ahead of him. 
2SA.15.2	 Absalom used to get up early and stand by the road leading to the city gate. When anyone had a case to be tried by King David, Absalom would ask, “Which city are you from?”
2SA.15.2	After the person had told him which tribe in Israel he was from, 
2SA.15.3	 Absalom would say, “Your case is good and proper, but the king hasn’t appointed anyone to hear it.” 
2SA.15.4	 He would add, “I wish someone would make me judge in the land. Then anyone who had a case to be tried could come to me, and I would make sure that he got justice.” 
2SA.15.5	 When anyone approached him and bowed down, Absalom would reach out, take hold of him, and kiss him. 
2SA.15.6	 This is what he did for all Israelites who came to the king to have him try their case. So Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel.
2SA.15.7	 Four years later Absalom said to the king, “Let me go to Hebron and keep the vow I made to the L
2SA.15.8	 I made a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram. I said, ‘If the L
2SA.15.9	 “Go in peace,” the king told him.
2SA.15.9	So he went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	 But Absalom sent his loyal supporters to all the tribes of Israel and said, “When you hear the sound of the ram’s horn, say, ‘Absalom has become king in Hebron.’ ”
2SA.15.11	 Two hundred men invited from Jerusalem went with Absalom. They went innocently, knowing nothing ⌊about Absalom’s plans⌋. 
2SA.15.12	 While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel, David’s adviser, to come from his home in Giloh. Meanwhile, the conspiracy grew stronger, and the number of people siding with Absalom kept getting larger.
2SA.15.13	 Someone came to tell David, “The hearts of the people of Israel are with Absalom.”
2SA.15.14	 David told all his men who were with him in Jerusalem, “Let’s flee immediately, or none of us will escape from Absalom. Let’s leave right away, or he’ll catch up to us and bring disaster on us when he massacres the city.”
2SA.15.15	 The king’s servants told him, “No matter what happens, we are Your Majesty’s servants.”
2SA.15.16	 The king left on foot, and his whole household followed him except ten concubines 
2SA.15.17	 As the king and his troops were leaving the city on foot, they stopped at the last house. 
2SA.15.18	 All his mercenaries passed by him; all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, Ittai, and all 600 men who had followed him from Gath were marching past the king.
2SA.15.19	 The king asked Ittai from Gath, “Why should you go with us? Go back, and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland. 
2SA.15.20	 You came to us just yesterday. Should I make you wander around with me when I don’t even know where I’m going? Go back, and take your countrymen with you. ⌊May the L
2SA.15.21	 But Ittai answered the king, “I solemnly swear, as the L
2SA.15.22	 So David told Ittai, “Go ahead and keep marching.” So Ittai from Gath marched on with all his men and all the families who were with him.
2SA.15.23	 The whole country was crying loudly as all the troops were passing by. The king was crossing the Kidron Valley, and all the people were moving down the road toward the desert. 
2SA.15.24	 Zadok and all the Levites with him were carrying the ark of God’s promise. They set down the ark of God beside Abiathar until all the troops had withdrawn from the city.
2SA.15.25	 The king told Zadok, “Take God’s ark back to the city. If the L
2SA.15.26	 But if he says, ‘I’m not pleased with you,’ let him do to me what he considers right.”
2SA.15.27	 “Aren’t you a seer?” 
2SA.15.28	 I’ll wait at the river crossings in the desert until I receive a message from you.” 
2SA.15.29	 So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.
2SA.15.30	 David cried as he went up the Mount of Olives. He covered his head and walked barefoot. And all of the troops with him covered their heads and cried as they went.
2SA.15.31	 Then David was told, “Ahithophel is among those conspiring with Absalom.” So David prayed, “L
2SA.15.32	 When David came to the top ⌊of the Mount of Olives⌋ where people worshiped God, Hushai from Archi’s family was there to meet him. His clothes were torn, and he had dirt on his head. 
2SA.15.33	 David told him, “If you go with me, you will only be a burden to me. 
2SA.15.34	 But if you go back to the city and say to Absalom, ‘Your Majesty, I’ll be your servant. I was your father’s servant in the past, but now I’ll be your servant,’ then you’ll ⌊help me by⌋ undoing Ahithophel’s advice. 
2SA.15.35	 The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be with you there. When you hear anything from the royal palace, tell it to the priests Zadok and Abiathar. 
2SA.15.36	 They have two sons with them: Zadok has Ahimaaz, and Abiathar has Jonathan. Send them to report to me anything you hear.”
2SA.15.37	 So Hushai, David’s friend, went to the city as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
2SA.16.1	 When David had gone over the top ⌊of the Mount of Olives⌋, Ziba, Mephibosheth’s servant, met him with a pair of saddled donkeys. They were loaded with 200 loaves of bread, 100 bunches of raisins, 100 pieces of ripened fruit, and a full wineskin.
2SA.16.2	 “Why did you bring these?” David asked Ziba.
2SA.16.2	“The donkeys are for the king’s family to ride on,” Ziba answered. “The bread and the ripe fruit are for ⌊your⌋ servants to eat. The wine is for those who become tired and thirsty in the desert.”
2SA.16.3	 “Where is your master Saul’s grandson?” the king asked.
2SA.16.3	“He’s staying in Jerusalem,” Ziba answered the king. “He said, ‘Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfather’s kingdom.’ ”
2SA.16.4	 The king told Ziba, “In that case everything that belonged to Mephibosheth now belongs to you.”
2SA.16.4	“I sincerely thank you,” said Ziba. “I hope to remain in your good graces, Your Majesty.”
2SA.16.5	 When King David came to Bahurim, a man who was a distant cousin of Saul came out cursing. His name was Shimei, son of Gera. 
2SA.16.6	 He threw stones at David and David’s servants, although all the people and all the warriors were shielding David. 
2SA.16.7	 Shimei cursed and said, “Get out! Get out, you bloodthirsty man! You worthless person! 
2SA.16.8	 The L
2SA.16.9	 Abishai, Zeruiah’s son, asked the king, “Why should this dead dog curse you, Your Majesty? Let me go over there and tear off his head.”
2SA.16.10	 But the king said, “You don’t think like me at all, sons of Zeruiah. Let him curse. If the L
2SA.16.11	 David told Abishai and all his servants, “My own son, my own flesh and blood, is trying to kill me. Why, then, shouldn’t this Benjaminite do this? Leave him alone. Let him curse, since the L
2SA.16.12	 Maybe the L
2SA.16.13	 As David and his men went along the road, Shimei was walking along the hillside parallel to him. Shimei cursed, hurled stones, and threw dirt at David. 
2SA.16.14	 The king and all the people with him finally arrived ⌊at their destination⌋ and rested there.
2SA.16.15	 Meanwhile, Absalom and all Israel’s troops came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. 
2SA.16.16	 When David’s friend Hushai from Archi’s family came to Absalom, he said, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
2SA.16.17	 “Is that how loyal you are to your friend?” Absalom asked Hushai. “Why didn’t you go with him?”
2SA.16.18	 Hushai answered Absalom, “No, I want to be with the one whom the L
2SA.16.19	 And besides, whom should I serve? Shouldn’t it be his son? As I served your father, so I’ll serve you.”
2SA.16.20	 Then Absalom asked Ahithophel, “What’s your advice? What should we do?”
2SA.16.21	 Ahithophel told Absalom, “Sleep with your father’s concubines 
2SA.16.22	 So a tent was put up on the roof for Absalom, and he slept with his father’s concubines in plain sight of Israel.
2SA.16.23	 In those days both David and Absalom thought that Ahithophel’s advice was like getting an answer from God.
2SA.17.1	 Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose 12,000 men and leave tonight to go after David. 
2SA.17.2	 I’ll attack him while he’s tired and weak, and I’ll cause him to panic. All the people with him will flee, but I’ll kill only him. 
2SA.17.3	 I’ll return all the people to you as a bride is returned to her husband. Since you will be seeking the life of only one man,
2SA.17.4	 Absalom and all the leaders of Israel approved this plan.
2SA.17.5	 Absalom said, “Please call Hushai, who is descended from Archi’s family, and let us hear what he, too, has to say.”
2SA.17.6	 When Hushai arrived, Absalom said to him, “Ahithophel has told us his plan. Should we do what he says? If not, tell us.”
2SA.17.7	 “This time Ahithophel’s advice is no good,” Hushai said to Absalom. 
2SA.17.8	 “You know your father and his men. They are warriors as fierce as a wild bear whose cubs have been stolen. Your father is an experienced soldier. He will not camp with the troops tonight. 
2SA.17.9	 He has already hidden in one of the ravines or some other place. If some of our soldiers are killed in the initial attack, others will definitely hear about it and say, ‘The troops that support Absalom have been defeated.’ 
2SA.17.10	 Even the bravest man with a heart like a lion would lose his courage, because all Israel knows that your father is a warrior and the men with him are brave. 
2SA.17.11	 So my advice is to gather all Israel’s troops from Dan to Beersheba, since they are as numerous as the sand on the seashore. Lead them into battle yourself. 
2SA.17.12	 Then we’ll attack him wherever we find him. We’ll fall on him as dew falls on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left ⌊alive⌋. 
2SA.17.13	 If he retreats into a city, all Israel will bring ropes to that city and drag it into a valley so that not even a pebble will be found there.”
2SA.17.14	 Absalom and all the people of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai from Archi’s family is better than Ahithophel’s advice.” (The L
2SA.17.15	 Then Hushai told the priests Zadok and Abiathar, “Ahithophel advised Absalom and the leaders of Israel to do one thing, but I advised them to do something else. 
2SA.17.16	 Now send messengers quickly to tell David, ‘Don’t rest tonight in the river crossings in the desert, but make sure you cross ⌊the river⌋, or Your Majesty and all the troops with him will be wiped out.’ ”
2SA.17.17	 Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En Rogel. They could not risk being seen coming into the city, so a servant girl was to go and tell them, and they were to go and tell King David. 
2SA.17.18	 But a young man saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz and told Absalom. So both of them left quickly and came to the home of a man in Bahurim who had a cistern in his courtyard, and they went down into it. 
2SA.17.19	 The man’s wife took a cover, spread it over the top of the cistern, and scattered some grain 
2SA.17.20	 Absalom’s servants came to the woman at her home. “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” they asked.
2SA.17.20	The woman said, “They’ve crossed the stream.”
2SA.17.20	The servants looked for them but did not find them. So Absalom’s servants returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.17.21	 After Absalom’s servants left, both men came out of the cistern and went and told King David. “Leave right away,” they told David. “Cross the river quickly because this is what Ahithophel has advised against you. . . .”
2SA.17.22	 David and all the troops with him left to cross the Jordan River. When the dawn came, everyone had crossed the Jordan River.
2SA.17.23	 When Ahithophel saw that his advice hadn’t been followed, he saddled his donkey, left, and went home to his own city. He gave instructions to his family. Then he hanged himself, died, and was buried in his father’s tomb.
2SA.17.24	 David had ⌊already⌋ come to Mahanaim by the time Absalom and all the men of Israel with him crossed the Jordan River. 
2SA.17.25	 Absalom appointed Amasa to take Joab’s place as commander of the army. (Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra, a descendant of Ishmael.
2SA.17.26	 The Israelites and Absalom camped in the region of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	 When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi, son of Nahash from Rabbah in Ammon, and Machir, son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai from Rogelim in Gilead 
2SA.17.28	 brought ⌊supplies⌋ and food for David and his troops: bedding, bowls, pots, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,
2SA.17.29	 honey, buttermilk, sheep, and calves. They brought these things because they thought, “The troops in the desert are hungry, exhausted, and thirsty.”
2SA.18.1	 David called together the troops that were with him. He appointed commanders in charge of regiments and battalions. 
2SA.18.2	 David put a third of the troops under Joab’s command, another third under Joab’s brother Abishai (Zeruiah’s son), and the last third under Ittai from Gath.
2SA.18.2	“I am going ⌊into battle⌋ with you,” the king said to the troops.
2SA.18.3	 “You’re not going ⌊with us⌋,” the troops said. “If we flee, they won’t care about us, and if half of us die, they won’t care either. But you’re worth 10,000 of us. It’s better for you to be ready to send us help from the city.”
2SA.18.4	 “I’ll do what you think best,” the king responded. So the king stood by the gate while all the troops marched out by battalions and regiments.
2SA.18.5	 The king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.” All the troops heard him give all the commanders this order regarding Absalom.
2SA.18.6	 So the troops went out to the country to fight Israel in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	 There David’s men defeated Israel’s army, and the massacre was sizable that day—20,000 men. 
2SA.18.8	 The fighting spread over the whole country. That day the woods devoured more people than the battle.
2SA.18.9	 Absalom happened to come face to face with some of David’s men. He was riding on a mule, and the mule went under the tangled branches of a large tree. Absalom’s head became caught in the tree. So he was left hanging 
2SA.18.10	 A man who saw this told Joab, “I saw Absalom hanging in a tree.”
2SA.18.11	 “What! You saw that!” Joab said to the man who told him. “Why didn’t you strike him to the ground? Then I would have felt obligated to give you four ounces of silver and a belt.”
2SA.18.12	 But the man told Joab, “Even if I felt the weight of 25 pounds of silver in my hand, I wouldn’t raise my hand against the king’s son. We heard the order the king gave you, Abishai, and Ittai: ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.’ 
2SA.18.13	 If I had done something treacherous to him, would you have stood by me? Like everything else, it wouldn’t stay hidden from the king.”
2SA.18.14	 Then Joab said, “I shouldn’t waste time with you like this.” He took three sharp sticks and plunged them into Absalom’s heart while he was still alive in the tree. 
2SA.18.15	 Then ten of Joab’s armorbearers surrounded Absalom, attacked him, and killed him.
2SA.18.16	 Joab blew the ram’s horn to stop their ⌊fighting⌋, and the troops returned from pursuing Israel. 
2SA.18.17	 They took Absalom, threw him into a huge pit in the forest, and piled a large heap of stones over him. Meanwhile, all Israel fled and went back to their homes.
2SA.18.18	 (⌊While he was still living,⌋ Absalom had taken a rock and set it up for himself in the king’s valley. He said, “I have no son to keep the memory of my name alive.” He called the rock by his name, and it is still called Absalom’s Monument today.)
2SA.18.19	 Then Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, said, “Let me run and bring the king the good news that the L
2SA.18.20	 But Joab told him, “You won’t be the man carrying good news today. You can carry the news some other day. You must not deliver the news today because the king’s son is dead.” 
2SA.18.21	 Then Joab said to a man from Sudan, “Go, tell the king what you saw.” The messenger bowed down with his face touching the ground in front of Joab and then ran off.
2SA.18.22	 Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, spoke to Joab again, “Whatever may happen, I also want to run after the Sudanese messenger.”
2SA.18.22	“Now, son, why should you deliver the message?” Joab asked. “You won’t be rewarded for this news.”
2SA.18.23	 “Whatever happens, I’d like to run,” ⌊replied Ahimaaz.⌋
2SA.18.23	“Run,” Joab told him. So Ahimaaz ran along the valley road and got ahead of the Sudanese messenger.
2SA.18.24	 David was sitting between the two gates while the watchman walked along the roof of the gate by the wall. As he looked, he saw a man running alone. 
2SA.18.25	 The watchman called and alerted the king.
2SA.18.25	“If he’s alone,” the king said, “he has good news to tell.” The runner continued to come closer.
2SA.18.26	 When the watchman saw another man running, the watchman called, “There’s ⌊another⌋ man running alone.”
2SA.18.26	The king said, “This one is also bringing good news.”
2SA.18.27	 The watchman said, “It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son.”
2SA.18.27	“He’s a good man,” the king said. “He must be coming with good news.”
2SA.18.28	 Then Ahimaaz came up to the king, greeted him, and bowed down in front of him. Ahimaaz said, “May the L
2SA.18.29	 “Is the young man Absalom alright?” the king asked.
2SA.18.29	Ahimaaz answered, “I saw a lot of confusion when Joab sent me away, but I didn’t know what it meant.”
2SA.18.30	 “Step aside, and stand here,” the king said. He stepped aside and stood there.
2SA.18.31	 Then the Sudanese messenger came. “Good news for Your Majesty!” he said. “Today the L
2SA.18.32	 “Is the young man Absalom alright?” the king asked.
2SA.18.32	The Sudanese messenger answered, “May your enemies and all who turned against you be like that young man!” 
2SA.18.33	 The king was shaken ⌊by the news⌋. He went to the room above the gate and cried. “My son Absalom!” he said as he went. “My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died in your place! Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.1	 Joab was told, “The king is crying and mourning for Absalom.” 
2SA.19.2	 The victory of that day was turned into mourning because all the troops heard that the king was grieving for his son. 
2SA.19.3	 That day the troops sneaked into the city as if they had fled from battle and were ashamed of it. 
2SA.19.4	 The king covered his face and cried loudly, “My son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.5	 Then Joab came into the house. “Today you have made all your men feel ashamed,” he said. “They saved your life and the lives of your sons, daughters, wives, and concubines 
2SA.19.6	 You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. Today, you have made it clear that your commanders and servants mean nothing to you. I think you would be pleased if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead. 
2SA.19.7	 Now, get up, go out, and encourage your men. I swear to you by the L
2SA.19.8	 The king sat in the gateway. When all the troops were told, “The king is sitting in the gateway,” they came to the king.
2SA.19.8	Meanwhile, Israel had fled and went back to their own homes. 
2SA.19.9	 All the people in all the tribes of Israel were arguing with one another, saying, “The king rescued us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines, but now he has fled from Absalom and left the country. 
2SA.19.10	 However, Absalom, whom we anointed to rule us, has died in battle. Why is no one talking about bringing back the king?”
2SA.19.11	 What all Israel was saying reached the king at his house. So King David sent ⌊this message⌋ to the priests Zadok and Abiathar: “Ask the leaders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last ⌊tribe⌋ to bring the king back to his palace? 
2SA.19.12	 You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood. Why should you be the last to bring back the king?’ 
2SA.19.13	 And tell Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my flesh and blood? May God strike me dead unless you are given Joab’s place to serve me always as the commander of the army.’ ”
2SA.19.14	 All the people of Judah were in total agreement. So they sent the king this message: “Come back with all your servants.”
2SA.19.15	 The king came back to the Jordan River, and the people of Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and bring him across the Jordan River. 
2SA.19.16	 Shimei, Gera’s son from the tribe of Benjamin and the town of Bahurim, hurried down with the people of Judah to meet King David. 
2SA.19.17	 One thousand people from Benjamin were with him. And Ziba, the servant of Saul’s family, rushed to the Jordan River across from the king. Ziba brought his 15 sons and 20 servants. 
2SA.19.18	 They crossed the river to bring over the king’s family and to do anything else the king wanted.
2SA.19.18	Shimei, Gera’s son, bowed down in front of the king as he was going to cross the Jordan River. 
2SA.19.19	 He pleaded with the king, “Don’t remember the crime I committed the day you left Jerusalem. Don’t hold it against me or even think about it, Your Majesty. 
2SA.19.20	 I know I’ve sinned. Today I’ve come as the first of all the house of Joseph to meet you.”
2SA.19.21	 But Abishai, Zeruiah’s son, replied, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for cursing the L
2SA.19.22	 David responded, “Are you sure we’re from the same family, sons of Zeruiah? You are my enemies today. Should anyone in Israel be killed today? Don’t I know that I’m king of Israel again?”
2SA.19.23	 The king promised Shimei, “You won’t die,” and the king swore to it.
2SA.19.24	 Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, went to meet the king. He had not tended to his feet, trimmed his mustache, or washed his clothes from the day the king left until he came home safely. 
2SA.19.25	 When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”
2SA.19.26	 He answered, “My servant deceived me, Your Majesty. Since I am disabled, I said, ‘Saddle the donkey for me, and I’ll ride on it and go with the king.’ 
2SA.19.27	 He told you lies about me, Your Majesty. However, you are like God’s Messenger. Do what you think is right. 
2SA.19.28	 You could have killed anyone in my entire family, Your Majesty. Instead, you’ve seated me with those who eat at your table. So I no longer have the right to complain to the king.”
2SA.19.29	 The king asked him, “Why do you keep talking about it? I’ve said that you and Ziba should divide the land.”
2SA.19.30	 “Let him take it all,” Mephibosheth told the king. “It’s enough for me that you’ve come home safely.”
2SA.19.31	 Barzillai, the man from Gilead, came from Rogelim with the king to the Jordan River to send him on his way. 
2SA.19.32	 Barzillai was an elderly man, 80 years old. Because he was a very rich man, he had provided the king with food while he was staying at Mahanaim.
2SA.19.33	 The king told Barzillai, “Cross the river with me. I’ll provide for you in Jerusalem.”
2SA.19.34	 Barzillai replied, “I don’t have much longer to live. I shouldn’t go with Your Majesty to Jerusalem. 
2SA.19.35	 I’m 80 years old now. How can I tell what is pleasant and what is not? Can I taste what I eat or drink? Can I still hear the singing of men and women? Why should I now become a burden to you, Your Majesty? 
2SA.19.36	 I’ll just cross the Jordan River with you. Why should you give me such a reward? 
2SA.19.37	 Please let me go back so that I can die in my city near the grave of my father and mother. But here is Chimham. Let him go across with you. And do for him what you think is right.”
2SA.19.38	 “Chimham will go across with me,” the king said. “I will do for him whatever you want. Anything you wish I’ll do for you.”
2SA.19.39	 All the troops crossed the Jordan River, and then the king crossed. The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him. Then Barzillai went back home.
2SA.19.40	 The king crossed the river to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him. All the troops from Judah and half of the troops from Israel brought the king across.
2SA.19.41	 Then all the people of Israel kept coming to the king. They asked, “Why did our cousins, the people of Judah, kidnap you and bring Your Majesty and your family and men across the Jordan River?”
2SA.19.42	 All the people of Judah answered the people of Israel, “Because the king is our relative. Why are you angry about this? Did we eat the king’s food, or did he give us any gifts?” 
2SA.19.43	 The people of Israel answered the people of Judah, “We have ten times your interest in the king and a greater claim on David than you have. Why, then, do you despise us? Weren’t we the first to suggest bringing back our king?”
2SA.19.43	But the people of Judah spoke ⌊even⌋ more harshly than the people of Israel.
2SA.20.1	 A good-for-nothing man by the name of Sheba, Bichri’s son, from the tribe of Benjamin happened to be at Gilgal. He blew a ram’s horn ⌊to announce⌋,
2SA.20.1	“We have no share in David’s kingdom.
2SA.20.1	We won’t receive an inheritance from Jesse’s son.
2SA.20.1	Everyone to his own tent, Israel!”
2SA.20.2	 So all the people of Israel left David to follow Sheba, Bichri’s son. But the people of Judah remained loyal to their king ⌊on his way⌋ from the Jordan River to Jerusalem.
2SA.20.3	 When David came to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines 
2SA.20.4	 The king told Amasa, “Call the people of Judah together for me, and in three days be here yourself.” 
2SA.20.5	 Amasa went to call Judah together, but he took longer to do it than David had given him.
2SA.20.6	 David then told Abishai, “Sheba, son of Bichri, will do us more harm than Absalom. Take my men and go after him, or he will find some fortified cities and take the best ones for himself.” 
2SA.20.7	 So Joab’s men, the Cherethites, Pelethites, and all the soldiers went with Abishai. They left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba, Bichri’s son. 
2SA.20.8	 When they were at the large rock in Gibeon, Amasa met them there. Joab wore a military uniform, and strapped over it at his hip was a sword in a scabbard. As he stepped forward, the sword dropped ⌊into his hand⌋. 
2SA.20.9	 “How are you, my brother?” Joab asked Amasa. He took hold of Amasa’s beard with his right hand to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	 Amasa wasn’t on his guard against the sword in Joab’s ⌊left⌋ hand. Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and his intestines poured out on the ground. (He died without being stabbed again.) Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba, son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.11	 One of Joab’s young men stood beside Amasa 
2SA.20.12	 Amasa was wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road. When the man saw that all the troops stopped as they came to the body, he carried Amasa from the road to the field and threw a sheet over him. 
2SA.20.13	 As soon as he was moved from the road, everyone followed Joab and pursued Sheba, Bichri’s son.
2SA.20.14	 Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel (Beth Maacah). All the Berites were gathered together and followed him to the city. 
2SA.20.15	 Joab’s army came and attacked him in Abel (Beth Maacah). They put up a dirt ramp against the city, and it stood level with the outer wall. All the troops with Joab were trying to destroy the wall and tear it down.
2SA.20.16	 Then a clever woman called from the city, “Listen, listen! Tell Joab to come here so that I can talk to him.”
2SA.20.17	 He came near, and she asked, “Are you Joab?”
2SA.20.17	“I am,” he answered.
2SA.20.17	“Listen to what I have to say,” she told him.
2SA.20.17	“I’m listening,” he answered.
2SA.20.18	 So she said, “There’s an old saying: ‘Be sure to ask at Abel ⌊before doing anything⌋. That’s the way they settle matters.’ 
2SA.20.19	 We are peaceful and faithful Israelites. Are you trying to destroy a mother city in Israel? Why should you swallow up what belongs to the L
2SA.20.20	 Joab answered, “That’s unthinkable! I don’t wish to swallow ⌊it⌋ up or destroy ⌊it⌋. 
2SA.20.21	 That isn’t the case. A man from the mountains of Ephraim by the name of Sheba, son of Bichri, has rebelled against King David. Give him to me, and I’ll withdraw from the city.”
2SA.20.21	“That’s fine,” the woman told Joab. “His head will be thrown to you from the wall.” 
2SA.20.22	 Then the woman went to all the people with her clever plan. They cut off Sheba’s head and threw it to Joab. He blew the ram’s horn, and everyone scattered and withdrew from the city and went home. Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem.
2SA.20.23	 Now, Joab was put in charge of Israel’s whole army. Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was in charge of the Cherethites and Pelethites. 
2SA.20.24	 Adoram was in charge of forced labor. Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the royal historian. 
2SA.20.25	 Sheva was the royal scribe. Zadok and Abiathar were priests. 
2SA.20.26	 And Ira, a descendant of Jair, was a priest to David.
2SA.21.1	 In the time of David, there was a famine for three successive years, and David asked the L
2SA.21.2	 (The Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were left over from the Amorites. Although the Israelites had sworn ⌊to spare them⌋, Saul, in his eagerness, tried to destroy them for Israel and Judah.)
2SA.21.2	The king called the Gibeonites 
2SA.21.3	 and asked them, “What can I do for you? What should I ⌊give you⌋ to make peace with you so that you will bless what belongs to the L
2SA.21.4	 “We do not want silver or gold from Saul’s family,” the Gibeonites answered him. “And none of us wants to kill ⌊anyone⌋ in Israel.”
2SA.21.4	The king asked, “What are you saying that I should do for you?”
2SA.21.5	 They answered the king, “Give us seven of the male descendants of the man who wanted to finish us off. He planned to wipe us out to keep us from staying anywhere in Israel’s territory. 
2SA.21.6	 We will execute them in the L
2SA.21.6	“I will give them ⌊to you⌋,” the king said.
2SA.21.7	 But the king spared Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s son and Saul’s grandson, because of the oath in the L
2SA.21.8	 The king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons whom Rizpah (Aiah’s daughter) gave birth to for Saul, and five sons whom Merab 
2SA.21.9	 The king handed them over to the Gibeonites, who executed them on the mountain in the L
2SA.21.10	 Rizpah (Aiah’s daughter) took sackcloth and stretched it out on the rock for herself from the beginning of the harvest until the sky rained on the dead bodies. She wouldn’t let any birds land on them during the day or any wild animals come near them during the night.
2SA.21.11	 When David was told what Saul’s concubine 
2SA.21.12	 David went and took the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. They had stolen them from the public square of Beth Shean, where the Philistines had hung them the day they killed Saul at Gilboa. 
2SA.21.13	 When David brought up the bones of Saul and Jonathan, his men gathered the bones of those who had been executed. 
2SA.21.14	 Then they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin, in Zela, in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish. They did everything the king ordered. After that, God answered the prayers for the land.
2SA.21.15	 Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. So David and his men went to fight the Philistines, but David became exhausted. 
2SA.21.16	 A descendant of Haraphah named Benob, who had a bronze spear weighing 7½ pounds which he wore on a new belt, captured David and intended to kill him. 
2SA.21.17	 But Abishai, son of Zeruiah, came to help David. He attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then David’s men swore an oath, saying, “You’ll never go into battle with us again. The lamp of Israel must never be extinguished.”
2SA.21.18	 After this, there was another battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai from Hushah killed Saph, another descendant of Haraphah. 
2SA.21.19	 When more fighting broke out with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan, son of Jaare Oregim from Bethlehem, killed Goliath of Gath. (The shaft of Goliath’s spear was like a beam used by weavers.) 
2SA.21.20	 In another battle at Gath, there was a tall man who had a total of 24 fingers and toes: six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He also was a descendant of Haraphah. 
2SA.21.21	 When he challenged Israel, Jonathan, son of David’s brother Shimei, killed him. 
2SA.21.22	 These four were descendants of Haraphah from Gath, and David and his men killed them.
2SA.22.1	 David sang this song to the L
2SA.22.2	 He said,

2SA.22.3	my refuge, and my Savior who saved me from violence.
2SA.22.4	 The L
2SA.22.4	I called on him, and I was saved from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	 The waves of death had surrounded me.
2SA.22.5	The torrents of destruction had overwhelmed me.
2SA.22.6	 The ropes of the grave had surrounded me.
2SA.22.6	The clutches of death had confronted me.
2SA.22.7	 I called on the L
2SA.22.7	I called to my God for help.
2SA.22.7	He heard my voice from his temple,
2SA.22.7	and my cry for help reached his ears.
2SA.22.8	 Then the earth shook and quaked.
2SA.22.8	Even the foundations of the heavens trembled.
2SA.22.8	They shook violently because he was angry.
2SA.22.9	 Smoke went up from his nostrils,
2SA.22.9	and a raging fire came out of his mouth.
2SA.22.9	Glowing coals flared up from it.
2SA.22.10	 He spread apart the heavens
2SA.22.10	and came down with a dark cloud under his feet.
2SA.22.11	 He rode on one of the angels 
2SA.22.11	and he soared on the wings of the wind.
2SA.22.12	 He surrounded himself with darkness.
2SA.22.12	He made the dark rain clouds his covering.
2SA.22.13	 Out of the brightness in front of him, he made lightning.
2SA.22.14	 The L
2SA.22.14	The Most High made his voice heard.
2SA.22.15	 He shot arrows and scattered them.
2SA.22.15	He flashed streaks of lightning and threw them into confusion.
2SA.22.16	 Then the ocean floor could be seen.
2SA.22.16	The foundations of the earth were laid bare
2SA.22.16	at the L
2SA.22.16	at the blast of the breath from his nostrils.
2SA.22.17	 He reached down from high above and took hold of me.
2SA.22.17	He pulled me out of the raging water.

2SA.23.19	 and was honored more than they were. So he became their captain, but he didn’t become a member of the three.
2SA.23.20	 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was from Kabzeel and was a brave man who did many things. He killed two distinguished soldiers from Moab. He also went into a pit and killed a lion on the day it snowed. 
2SA.23.21	 And he killed a handsome Egyptian. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand. Benaiah went to him with a club, grabbed the spear from him, and killed him with it.

2SA.23.23	 He was honored more than the thirty, but he was not a member of the three. David put him in charge of his bodyguards.

2SA.24.4	 However, the king overruled Joab and the commanders of the army. So they left the king ⌊in order⌋ to count the people of Israel. 
2SA.24.5	 They crossed the Jordan River and camped at Aroer, south of the city in the middle of the valley. Then they went to Gad and to Jazer. 
2SA.24.6	 They went to Gilead and to Tahtim Hodshi and then to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon. 
2SA.24.7	 They went to the fortified city of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah. 
2SA.24.8	 When they had covered the whole country, they came to Jerusalem after 9 months and 20 days. 
2SA.24.9	 Joab reported the census figures to the king: In Israel there were 800,000 able-bodied men who could serve in the army, and in Judah there were 500,000.
2SA.24.10	 After David counted the people, his conscience troubled him. David said to the L

1KI.1.1	 King David had grown old, and although he was covered with blankets, he couldn’t get warm. 
1KI.1.2	 His officials told him, “Your Majesty, let us search for a young woman who has never been married. She can stay with you and be your servant. She can lie in your arms and keep you warm.”
1KI.1.3	 So they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful, young woman. They found Abishag from Shunem and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	 The woman was very beautiful. She became the king’s servant and took care of him, but the king did not make love to her.
1KI.1.5	 Adonijah, son of Haggith,
1KI.1.6	 His father had never confronted him by asking why he was doing this. 
1KI.1.7	 But Adonijah had discussed his actions with Joab (son of Zeruiah) and with the priest Abiathar, so they supported him. 
1KI.1.8	 But the priest Zadok, Benaiah (son of Jehoiada), the prophet Nathan, Shimei, Rei, and David’s ⌊thirty⌋ fighting men did not join Adonijah.
1KI.1.9	 Adonijah sacrificed sheep, cattle, and fattened calves at Zoheleth Rock near En Rogel. He had invited all his brothers, the king’s ⌊other⌋ sons, all the men of Judah, and the king’s officials. 
1KI.1.10	 But he didn’t invite the prophet Nathan, Benaiah, the fighting men, or his brother Solomon.
1KI.1.11	 Then Nathan asked Solomon’s mother Bathsheba, “Haven’t you heard that Adonijah, Haggith’s son, has become king, and our master David doesn’t ⌊even⌋ know about it? 
1KI.1.12	 Bathsheba, let me give you some advice about how to save your life and your son’s life. 
1KI.1.13	 Go to King David and ask him, ‘Your Majesty, didn’t you swear to me that my son Solomon will be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne? Why is Adonijah acting as king?’ 
1KI.1.14	 And while you’re still there talking to the king, I’ll come in and confirm what you have said.”
1KI.1.15	 Bathsheba went to the king in his private room. The king was very old, and Abishag from Shunem was taking care of him. 
1KI.1.16	 Bathsheba knelt and bowed down in front of the king. “What do you want?” the king asked.
1KI.1.17	 “Sir,” she answered, “You took an oath to the L
1KI.1.18	 But now, you see, Adonijah has become king, and you don’t ⌊even⌋ know anything about it, Your Majesty. 
1KI.1.19	 He has sacrificed many fattened calves, bulls, and sheep. He has invited all the king’s sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army ⌊to his feast⌋. But he hasn’t invited your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.20	 All Israel is looking to you, Your Majesty, to tell them who should succeed you on your throne. 
1KI.1.21	 Otherwise, my son Solomon and I will be treated like criminals when you lie down in death with your ancestors.”
1KI.1.22	 While she was still talking to the king, the prophet Nathan arrived. 
1KI.1.23	 The servants told the king, “The prophet Nathan is here.” When he came to the king, he bowed down in front of him. 
1KI.1.24	 Nathan said, “Your Majesty, you must have said that Adonijah will be king after you and that he will sit on your throne, 
1KI.1.25	 because today he went and sacrificed many bulls, fattened calves, and sheep. He invited all the king’s sons, the army’s commanders, and the priest Abiathar ⌊to his feast⌋. They are eating and drinking with him and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ 
1KI.1.26	 But he didn’t invite me or the priest Zadok or Benaiah, who is Jehoiada’s son, or your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.27	 Did you allow this to happen without telling me who would sit on your throne next?”
1KI.1.28	 Then King David answered, “Call Bathsheba in here.” So she stood in front of him, 
1KI.1.29	 and he swore an oath. He said, “I solemnly swear, as the L
1KI.1.30	 I will do today exactly what I swore to you by the L
1KI.1.31	 Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face touching the ground in front of the king. “May Your Majesty, King David, live forever!” she said.
1KI.1.32	 King David said, “Summon the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah, son of Jehoiada.” So they came to the king, 
1KI.1.33	 and he said, “Take my officials with you. Put my son Solomon on my mule, and take him to Gihon. 
1KI.1.34	 Have the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan anoint him king of Israel there. Then blow the ram’s horn and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 
1KI.1.35	 Follow him ⌊back⌋ here when he comes to sit on my throne. He will be king in place of me. I have appointed him to be the leader of Israel and Judah.”

1KI.1.38	 Then the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, Benaiah (son of Jehoiada), the Cherethites, and the Pelethites put Solomon on King David’s mule and brought him to Gihon. 
1KI.1.39	 The priest Zadok took the container of olive oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram’s horn, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!” 
1KI.1.40	 All the people followed him, blew flutes, and celebrated so loudly that their voices shook the ground.
1KI.1.41	 Adonijah and all his guests heard this as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the horn, he asked, “What’s the reason for the noise in the city?” 
1KI.1.42	 He was still speaking when Jonathan, son of the priest Abiathar, arrived. “Come in,” Adonijah said. “You’re an honorable man, so you must be bringing good news.”
1KI.1.43	 “Not at all,” Jonathan answered Adonijah. “His Majesty King David has made Solomon king. 
1KI.1.44	 The king has sent the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, Benaiah (son of Jehoiada), the Cherethites, and the Pelethites with him. They have put him on the king’s mule. 
1KI.1.45	 The priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan have anointed him king at Gihon. They have come from there celebrating, so the city is excited. That is the sound you heard. 
1KI.1.46	 Solomon is now seated on the royal throne. 
1KI.1.47	 Furthermore, the royal officials have come ⌊to congratulate⌋ His Majesty King David, saying, ‘May your God make Solomon’s name more famous than yours and his reign greater than your reign.’ The king himself bowed down on his bed 
1KI.1.48	 and said, ‘Praise the L
1KI.1.49	 Adonijah’s guests were frightened, so they got up and scattered in all directions. 
1KI.1.50	 Adonijah was afraid of Solomon. He got up, went ⌊to the tent of meeting,⌋ and took hold of the horns of the altar.
1KI.1.51	 Someone told Solomon, “Adonijah is afraid of you, King Solomon. He is holding on to the horns of the altar and saying, ‘Make King Solomon swear to me today that he will not have me killed.’ ”
1KI.1.52	 Solomon said, “If he will behave like an honorable man, not one hair on his head will fall to the ground. But if he does ⌊anything⌋ wrong, he will die.” 
1KI.1.53	 King Solomon sent men to take him from the altar. Adonijah bowed down in front of King Solomon. “Go home,” Solomon told him.
1KI.2.1	 When David was about to die, he instructed his son Solomon, 
1KI.2.2	 “I’m about to leave this world. Be strong and mature.

When there was peace, he shed blood as if it were wartime. With their blood he stained the belt around his waist and the shoes on his feet. 
1KI.2.6	 Use your wisdom. Don’t let that gray-haired, old man go to his grave peacefully.
1KI.2.7	 “Be kind to the sons of Barzillai from Gilead. Let them eat at your table. They helped me when I was fleeing from your brother Absalom.

1KI.2.9	 Now, don’t let him go unpunished. You are wise and know what to do to him: Put that gray-haired, old man into his grave by slaughtering him.”
1KI.2.10	 David lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. 
1KI.2.11	 He ruled as king of Israel for 40 years. He ruled for 7 years in Hebron and for 33 years in Jerusalem.
1KI.2.12	 Solomon sat on his father David’s throne, and his power was firmly established.
1KI.2.13	 Then Adonijah, son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. “Is this a friendly visit?” she asked.
1KI.2.13	“Yes,” he answered. 
1KI.2.14	 Then he added, “I have a matter ⌊to discuss⌋ with you.”
1KI.2.14	“What is it?” she asked.

1KI.2.18	 “Very well,” Bathsheba answered. “I will talk to the king for you.”
1KI.2.19	 Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk to him on Adonijah’s behalf. The king got up to meet her and bowed down in front of her. Then he sat on his throne. He had a throne brought for his mother, and she sat at his right side.
1KI.2.20	 “I’m asking you for one little thing,” she said. “Don’t refuse me.”
1KI.2.20	“Ask, Mother,” the king told her. “I won’t refuse you.”
1KI.2.21	 She replied, “Let Abishag from Shunem be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife.”
1KI.2.22	 King Solomon then said, “Why do you ask that Abishag from Shunem be given to Adonijah? That would be the same as giving him the kingship. After all, he is my older brother. The priest Abiathar and Joab (Zeruiah’s son) are supporting him.”

1KI.2.35	 The king then appointed Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, to replace Joab as commander of the army. King Solomon also replaced Abiathar with the priest Zadok.
1KI.2.36	 The king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem, and stay there. Don’t leave ⌊the city⌋ to go anywhere else.

1KI.2.38	 “Very well,” Shimei answered. “I’ll do just what Your Majesty said.”
1KI.2.38	So Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time. 
1KI.2.39	 But after three years, two of Shimei’s slaves fled to Gath’s King Achish, son of Maacah. Shimei was told that his slaves were in Gath, 
1KI.2.40	 so he saddled his donkey and went to Achish in Gath to search for his slaves. Shimei went to Gath and got his slaves.
1KI.2.41	 After Solomon heard that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and back, 
1KI.2.42	 he summoned Shimei. Solomon asked him, “Didn’t I make you take an oath by the L
1KI.2.43	 Why didn’t you keep your oath to the L
1KI.2.44	 Shimei, you know in your heart all the evil that you did to my father David. The L
1KI.2.45	 But King Solomon is blessed, and David’s dynasty will always be firmly established by the L
1KI.2.46	 Then the king gave orders to Benaiah, son of Jehoiada. He went to attack and kill Shimei.
1KI.2.46	Solomon’s power as king was now firmly established.
1KI.3.1	 Solomon became the son-in-law of Pharaoh (the king of Egypt). After marrying Pharaoh’s daughter, Solomon brought her to the City of David until he finished building his own house, the L
1KI.3.2	 The people were still sacrificing at other worship sites because a temple for the name of the L
1KI.3.3	 Solomon loved the L
1KI.3.4	 King Solomon went to Gibeon to sacrifice because it was the most important place of worship. Solomon sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings on that altar.
1KI.3.5	 In Gibeon the L
1KI.3.6	 Solomon responded, “You’ve shown great love to my father David, who was your servant. He lived in your presence with truth, righteousness, and commitment. And you continued to show him your great love by giving him a son to sit on his throne today.
1KI.3.7	 “L
1KI.3.8	 I’m among your people whom you have chosen. They are too numerous to count or record. 
1KI.3.9	 Give me a heart that listens so that I can judge your people and tell the difference between good and evil. After all, who can judge this great people of yours?”
1KI.3.10	 The L
1KI.3.11	 God replied, “You’ve asked for this and not for a long life, or riches for yourself, or the death of your enemies. Instead, you’ve asked for understanding so that you can do what is right. 
1KI.3.12	 So I’m going to do what you’ve asked. I’m giving you a wise and understanding heart so that there will never be anyone like you. 
1KI.3.13	 I’m also giving you what you haven’t asked for—riches and honor—so that no other king will be like you as long as you live. 
1KI.3.14	 And if you follow me and obey my laws and commands as your father David did, then I will also give you a long life.”
1KI.3.15	 Solomon woke up and realized it had been a dream. He went to Jerusalem and stood in front of the ark of the L
1KI.3.16	 A short time later two prostitutes came to the king and stood in front of him. 
1KI.3.17	 One woman said to him, “Sir, this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth ⌊to a son⌋ while she was with me in the house. 
1KI.3.18	 Two days later this woman also gave birth ⌊to a son⌋. We were alone. No one else was with us. Just the two of us were in the house. 
1KI.3.19	 That night this woman’s son died because she rolled over on top of him. 
1KI.3.20	 So she got up during the night and took my son, who was beside me, while I was asleep. She held him in her arms. Then she laid her dead son in my arms. 
1KI.3.21	 When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, he was dead! I took a good look at him and realized that he wasn’t my son at all!”
1KI.3.22	 The other woman said, “No! My son is alive—your son is dead.”
1KI.3.22	The first woman kept on saying, “No! Your son is dead—my son is alive.” So they argued in front of the king.
1KI.3.23	 The king said, “This one keeps saying, ‘My son is alive—your son is dead,’ and that one keeps saying, ‘No! Your son is dead—my son is alive.’ ”
1KI.3.24	 So the king told his servants to bring him a sword. When they brought it, 
1KI.3.25	 he said, “Cut the living child in two. Give half to the one and half to the other.”
1KI.3.26	 Then the woman whose son was still alive was deeply moved by her love for the child. She said to the king, “Please, sir, give her the living child. Please don’t kill him!”
1KI.3.26	But the other woman said, “He won’t be mine or yours. Cut him ⌊in two⌋.”
1KI.3.27	 The king replied, “Give the living child to the first woman. Don’t kill him. She is his mother.”
1KI.3.28	 All Israel heard about the decision the king made. They respected the king very highly, because they saw he possessed wisdom from God to do what was right.
1KI.4.1	 When King Solomon was the king of all Israel, 
1KI.4.2	 these were his officials:
1KI.4.2	Azariah, son of Zadok, was the ⌊chief⌋ priest.
1KI.4.3	 Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, were scribes.
1KI.4.3	Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the royal historian.
1KI.4.4	 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was commander of the army.
1KI.4.4	Zadok and Abiathar were priests.
1KI.4.5	 Azariah, son of Nathan, was in charge of the district governors.
1KI.4.5	Zabud, son of Nathan, was the king’s adviser.
1KI.4.6	 Ahishar was in charge of the palace.
1KI.4.6	Adoniram, son of Abda, was in charge of forced labor.
1KI.4.7	 Solomon appointed 12 district governors in Israel. They were to provide food for the king and his palace. Each one had to supply food for one month every year. 
1KI.4.8	 Their names were
1KI.4.8	Benhur, who was in charge of the hills of Ephraim,
1KI.4.9	 Bendeker, who was in charge of Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan, and
1KI.4.10	 Benhesed, who was in charge of Arubboth, Socoh, and the entire region of Hepher.
1KI.4.11	 Benabinadab had the entire region of Dor.
1KI.4.11	(Solomon’s daughter Taphath was his wife.)
1KI.4.12	 Baana, son of Ahilud, had Taanach, Megiddo, and all of Beth Shean.
1KI.4.12	(This was near Zarethan, below Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah and over to Jokmeam.)
1KI.4.13	 Bengeber was in charge of Ramoth Gilead; he had the settlements of Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, in Gilead.
1KI.4.13	He ⌊also⌋ had the territory of Argob in Bashan, 60 large cities with walls and bronze bars across their gates.
1KI.4.14	 Ahinadab, son of Iddo, was in charge of Mahanaim.
1KI.4.15	 Ahimaaz was in charge of Naphtali.
1KI.4.15	(He also married Solomon’s daughter Basemath.)
1KI.4.16	 Baana, son of Hushai, was in charge of Asher and Aloth.
1KI.4.17	 Jehoshaphat, son of Paruah, was in charge of Issachar.
1KI.4.18	 Shimei, son of Ela, was in charge of Benjamin.
1KI.4.19	 Geber, son of Uri, was in charge of Gilead, the territory of King Sihon the Amorite and King Og of Bashan. (There was only one governor in that territory.) 
1KI.4.20	 The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They ate and drank and lived happily.
1KI.4.21	 Solomon ruled all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the country of the Philistines and as far as the Egyptian border. These kingdoms paid taxes and were subject to Solomon as long as he lived.
1KI.4.22	 Solomon’s food supply for one day was 180 bushels of flour, 360 bushels of coarse flour, 
1KI.4.23	 10 fattened cows, 20 cows from the pasture, and 100 sheep in addition to deer, gazelles, fallow deer, and fattened birds. 
1KI.4.24	 He controlled all the territory west of the Euphrates River from Tiphsah to Gaza and all of its kings. So he lived in peace with all the neighboring countries. 
1KI.4.25	 As long as Solomon lived, Judah and Israel (from Dan to Beersheba) lived securely, everyone under his own vine and fig tree.
1KI.4.26	 Solomon had stalls for 40,000 chariot horses. He also had 12,000 chariot soldiers.
1KI.4.27	 Each of the governors provided food for one month every year for King Solomon and all who ate at his table. The governors saw to it that nothing was in short supply. 
1KI.4.28	 They brought their quota of barley and straw for the chariot horses to the proper places.
1KI.4.29	 God gave Solomon wisdom—keen insight and a mind as limitless as the sand on the seashore. 
1KI.4.30	 Solomon’s wisdom was greater than that of all the eastern people and all the wisdom of the Egyptians. 
1KI.4.31	 He was wiser than anyone, than Ethan the Ezrahite, or Heman, Calcol, or Darda, Mahol’s sons. His fame spread to all the nations around him.
1KI.4.32	 Solomon spoke 3,000 proverbs and wrote 1,005 songs. 
1KI.4.33	 He described and classified trees—from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing out of the wall. He described and classified animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. 
1KI.4.34	 People came from every nation to hear his wisdom; they came from all the kings of the earth who had heard about his wisdom.
1KI.5.1	 King Hiram of Tyre sent his officials to Solomon when he heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father. Hiram had always been David’s friend.
1KI.5.2	 Solomon sent word to Hiram, by saying, 
1KI.5.3	 “You know that my father David was surrounded by war. He couldn’t build a temple for the name of the L
1KI.5.4	 But the L
1KI.5.5	 Now I’m thinking of building a temple for the name of the L
1KI.5.6	 So order men to cut down cedars from Lebanon for me. My workers will work with your workers. I will pay you whatever wages you ask for your workers. You know we don’t have any skilled lumberjacks like those from Sidon.”
1KI.5.7	 Hiram was very glad to hear what Solomon had said. Hiram responded, “May the L
1KI.5.8	 Hiram sent men to Solomon to say, “I’ve received the message you sent me. I will do everything you want in regard to the cedar and cypress logs. 
1KI.5.9	 My workers will bring logs from Lebanon to the sea, and I will have them make them into rafts to go by sea to any place you specify. There I will have them taken apart, and you can use them. You can pay me by providing food for my palace.” 
1KI.5.10	 So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and cypress wood he wanted. 
1KI.5.11	 Solomon gave Hiram 120,000 bushels of wheat and 120,000 gallons of pure olive oil. Solomon paid Hiram this much every year.
1KI.5.12	 The L
1KI.5.13	 King Solomon forced 30,000 men from all over Israel to work for him. 
1KI.5.14	 He sent a shift of 10,000 men to Lebanon for a month. They would spend one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of forced labor.
1KI.5.15	 Solomon had 70,000 men who carried heavy loads, 70,000 who quarried stone in the mountains, 
1KI.5.16	 and 3,300 foremen who were in charge of the workers. 
1KI.5.17	 The king commanded them to quarry large, expensive blocks of stone in order to provide a foundation of cut stone for the temple. 
1KI.5.18	 Solomon’s workmen, Hiram’s workmen, and men from Gebal quarried the stone and prepared the logs and stone to build the temple.
1KI.6.1	 Solomon began to build the L
1KI.6.2	 The temple that King Solomon built for the L
1KI.6.3	 The entrance hall in front of the main room of the temple was the same length as the shorter side of the temple. It extended 15 feet in front of the temple. 
1KI.6.4	 He also made latticed windows for the temple.
1KI.6.5	 He built an annex containing side rooms all around the temple. This annex was next to the walls of the main building and the inner sanctuary. 
1KI.6.6	 The ⌊interior of⌋ the lowest story of the annex was 7½ feet wide, the second story was 9 feet wide, and the third story was 10½ feet wide. Solomon made ledges all around the temple so that this annex would not be fastened to the walls of the temple.
1KI.6.7	 The temple was built with stone blocks that were finished at the quarry. No hammer, chisel, or any other iron tool made a sound at the temple construction site.
1KI.6.8	 The entrance to the first story 
1KI.6.9	 When he had finished building the walls, he roofed the temple with rows of cedar beams and planks.
1KI.6.10	 He built ⌊each story of the⌋ annex 7½ feet high alongside the entire temple. Its cedar beams were attached to the temple.
1KI.6.11	 The L
1KI.6.12	 “This concerns the temple you are building: If you live by my laws, follow my rules, and keep my commands, I will fulfill the promise I made about you to your father David. 
1KI.6.13	 I will live among the Israelites and never abandon my people.”
1KI.6.14	 When Solomon had finished building the temple’s ⌊frame⌋, 
1KI.6.15	 he began to line the inside walls of the temple with cedar boards. He paneled the inside of the temple with wood from floor to ceiling. He covered the floor of the temple with cypress planks.
1KI.6.16	 He sectioned off a 30-foot-long room at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from the floor to the rafters. He built it to serve as an inner room, the most holy place. 
1KI.6.17	 The 60-foot-long room at the front of the temple served as the main hall. 
1KI.6.18	 Gourds and flowers were carved into the cedar paneling inside the temple. Everything was ⌊covered with⌋ cedar. No stone could be seen.
1KI.6.19	 He prepared the inner room of the temple in order to put the ark of the L
1KI.6.20	 The inner room was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high. Solomon covered it and the cedar altar with pure gold. 
1KI.6.21	 He covered the inside of the temple with pure gold. He put golden chains across the front of the inner room which was covered with gold. 
1KI.6.22	 He covered the entire inside of the temple with gold. He also covered the entire altar in the inner room with gold.
1KI.6.23	 In the inner room he made two 15-foot-tall angels 
1KI.6.24	 Each wing of the angels was 7½ feet long. The distance from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other was 15 feet. 
1KI.6.25	 Both angels had a 15-foot ⌊wingspan⌋. Both had the same measurements and the same shape. 
1KI.6.26	 Each was 15 feet high. 
1KI.6.27	 Solomon put the angels in the inner room of the temple. The wings of the angels extended so that the wing of one of the angels touched the one wall, and the wing of the other touched the other wall. Their remaining wings touched each other in the center of the room. 
1KI.6.28	 He covered the angels with gold.
1KI.6.29	 He carved angels, palm trees, and flowers into the walls all around the inner and outer rooms of the temple. 
1KI.6.30	 He covered the floor of the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.
1KI.6.31	 He made doors for the entrance to the inner room out of olive wood. The doorposts had five sides. 
1KI.6.32	 The two doors were ⌊made out of⌋ olive wood. He carved angels, palm trees, and flowers into them and covered them with gold. The gold was hammered onto the angels and the palm trees.
1KI.6.33	 In the same way he made square doorposts out of olive wood for the temple’s entrance. 
1KI.6.34	 He made two doors from cypress. Each of the doors had two folding panels. 
1KI.6.35	 On them he carved angels, palm trees, and flowers. He evenly covered them with gold.
1KI.6.36	 He built the inner courtyard with three courses of finished stones and a course of finished cedar beams.
1KI.6.37	 In the month of Ziv of the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, the foundation of the L
1KI.6.38	 In the month of Bul (the eighth month) of the eleventh year ⌊of his reign⌋, the temple was finished according to all its plans and specifications. He spent seven years building it.
1KI.7.1	 Solomon took 13 years to finish building his palace. 
1KI.7.2	 He built a hall ⌊named⌋ the Forest of Lebanon. It was 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. It had four rows of cedar pillars supporting cedar beams. 
1KI.7.3	 The hall was covered with cedar above the side rooms, which were supported by 45 pillars (15 per row).
1KI.7.4	 The windows were in three rows facing each other on opposite sides ⌊of the palace⌋. 
1KI.7.5	 All the doors and doorframes were square. There were three doors facing each other on opposite sides ⌊of the palace⌋.
1KI.7.6	 Solomon made the Hall of Pillars 75 feet long and 45 feet wide. In front of the hall was an entrance hall with pillars.
1KI.7.7	 He made the Hall of Justice, where he sat on his throne and served as judge. The hall was covered with cedar from floor to ceiling.
1KI.7.8	 His own private quarters were in a different location than the Hall of Justice, but they were similar in design. Solomon also built private quarters like this for his wife, Pharaoh’s daughter.
1KI.7.9	 From the foundation to the roof, all these buildings, including the large courtyard, were built with high-grade stone blocks. The stone blocks were cut to size and trimmed with saws on their inner and outer faces. 
1KI.7.10	 The foundation was made with large, high-grade stones (some 12 feet long, others 15 feet long). 
1KI.7.11	 Above ⌊the foundation⌋ were cedar beams and high-grade stone blocks, which had been cut to size. 
1KI.7.12	 The large courtyard had three layers of cut stone blocks and a layer of cedar beams, like the inner courtyard of the L
1KI.7.13	 King Solomon had Hiram brought from Tyre. 
1KI.7.14	 Hiram was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali. His father, a native of Tyre, was a skilled bronze craftsman. Hiram was highly skilled, resourceful, and knowledgeable about all kinds of bronze craftsmanship. He came to King Solomon and did all his ⌊bronze⌋ work.
1KI.7.15	 He made two bronze pillars. Each was 27 feet high and 18 feet in circumference. 
1KI.7.16	 He made two capitals of cast bronze to put on top of the pillars. Each capital was 7½ feet high. 
1KI.7.17	 He also made seven rows of filigree and chains for each capital. 
1KI.7.18	 After he made the pillars, he made two rows ⌊of decorations⌋ around the filigree to cover the capitals which were above the pillars.
1KI.7.19	 The capitals on top of the pillars in the entrance hall were lily-shaped. ⌊Each⌋ was six feet high. 
1KI.7.20	 Two hundred pomegranates in rows were directly above the bowl-shaped parts around the filigree on the capitals on both pillars.
1KI.7.21	 Hiram set up the pillars in the temple’s entrance hall. He set up the pillar on the right and named it Jachin [He Establishes]. Then he set up the pillar on the left and named it Boaz [In Him Is Strength]. 
1KI.7.22	 There were lily-shaped capitals at the top of the pillars. He finished the work on the pillars.
1KI.7.23	 Hiram made a pool from cast metal. It was 15 feet in diameter. It was round, 7½ feet high, and had a circumference of 45 feet. 
1KI.7.24	 Under the rim were two rows of gourds all around the 45-foot circumference of the pool. They were cast in metal when the pool was cast. 
1KI.7.25	 The pool was set on 12 metal bulls. Three bulls faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. The pool was set on them, and their hindquarters were toward the center ⌊of the pool⌋. 
1KI.7.26	 The pool was three inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup, shaped like a lily’s bud. It held 12,000 gallons.
1KI.7.27	 He made ten bronze stands. Each stand was 6 feet square and 4½ feet high. 
1KI.7.28	 The stands were made this way: They had side panels set in frames. 
1KI.7.29	 On the panels set in frames were lions, oxen, and angels.
1KI.7.30	 Each stand had four bronze wheels on bronze axles and four supports beneath the basin. The supports were made of cast metal with designs on the sides. 
1KI.7.31	 Each had a 1½-foot-deep opening in the center to the circular frame on top. The opening was round, formed like a pedestal, and was two feet ⌊wide⌋. Around the opening there were engravings. But the panels were square, not round. 
1KI.7.32	 The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles were attached to the stand. Each wheel was two feet high. 
1KI.7.33	 The wheels were made like chariot wheels. The axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all cast metal. 
1KI.7.34	 The four supports at the four corners of each stand were part of the stand. 
1KI.7.35	 The top of each stand had a round, nine-inch-high band. Above the stand were supports which were part of the panels. 
1KI.7.36	 Hiram engraved angels, lions, palm trees, and designs in every available space on the supports and panels. 
1KI.7.37	 This is the way he made the ten stands. All of them were cast in the same mold, identical in size and shape.
1KI.7.38	 Hiram also made ten bronze basins. Each basin held 240 gallons. Every basin was six feet ⌊wide⌋. There was one basin on each of the ten stands. 
1KI.7.39	 He put five stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north side of the temple. He set the pool on the south side of the temple in the southeast ⌊corner⌋. 
1KI.7.40	 Hiram also made pots, shovels, and bowls.
1KI.7.40	So Hiram finished all the work for King Solomon on the L
1KI.7.41	 2 pillars, the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the 2 pillars, and 2 sets of filigree to cover the 2 bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars, 
1KI.7.42	 400 pomegranates for the 2 sets of filigree (2 rows of pomegranates for each filigree to cover the 2 bowl-shaped capitals on the pillars), 
1KI.7.43	 10 stands and 10 basins on the stands, 
1KI.7.44	 1 pool, 12 bulls under the pool, 
1KI.7.45	 pots, shovels, and bowls. Hiram made all these utensils out of polished bronze for the L
1KI.7.46	 The king cast them in foundries in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan. 
1KI.7.47	 Solomon left all the products unweighed because so much bronze was used. No one tried to determine how much the bronze weighed.
1KI.7.48	 Solomon made all the furnishings for the L
1KI.7.49	 lamp stands of pure gold (five on the south side and five on the north in front of the inner room), flowers, lamps, gold tongs, 
1KI.7.50	 dishes, snuffers, bowls, saucers, incense burners of pure gold, the gold sockets for the doors of the inner ⌊room⌋ (the most holy place), and the doors of the temple.
1KI.7.51	 All the work King Solomon did on the L
1KI.8.1	 Then Solomon assembled the respected leaders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the Israelite families. They came to King Solomon in Jerusalem to take the ark of the L
1KI.8.2	 All the people of Israel gathered around King Solomon at the Festival ⌊of Booths⌋ in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month.
1KI.8.3	 When all the leaders of Israel had arrived, the priests picked up the L
1KI.8.4	 They brought the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy utensils in it ⌊to the temple⌋. The priests and the Levites carried them 
1KI.8.5	 while King Solomon with the whole assembly from Israel were offering countless sheep and cattle sacrifices in front of the ark. 
1KI.8.6	 The priests brought the ark of the L
1KI.8.7	 When the angels’ outstretched wings were over the place where the ark ⌊rested⌋, the angels became a covering above the ark and its poles. 
1KI.8.8	 The poles were so long that their ends could be seen in the holy place by anyone standing in front of the inner room, but they couldn’t be seen outside. (They are still there today.) 
1KI.8.9	 There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets Moses put there at Horeb, where the L
1KI.8.10	 When the priests left the holy place, a cloud filled the L
1KI.8.11	 The priests couldn’t serve because of the cloud. The L
1KI.8.12	 Then Solomon said, “The L
1KI.8.13	 I certainly have built you a high temple, a home for you to live in permanently.”
1KI.8.14	 Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel while they were standing. 
1KI.8.15	 “Thanks be to the L
1KI.8.16	 ‘Ever since I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I didn’t choose any city in any of the tribes of Israel as a place to build a temple for my name. But now I’ve chosen David to rule my people Israel.’
1KI.8.17	 “My father David had his heart set on building a temple for the name of the L
1KI.8.18	 However, the L
1KI.8.19	 But you must not build the temple. Instead, your own son will build the temple for my name.’ 
1KI.8.20	 The L
1KI.8.21	 I’ve made a place there for the ark which contains the L
1KI.8.22	 In the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, Solomon stood in front of the L
1KI.8.23	 and said,
1KI.8.23	“L
1KI.8.23	there is no god like you in heaven above or on earth below.
1KI.8.23	You keep your promise 
1KI.8.23	who obey you wholeheartedly.

1KI.8.24	With your mouth you promised it.
1KI.8.24	With your hand you carried it out as it is today.
1KI.8.25	 “Now, L
1KI.8.25	keep your promise to my father David, your servant.

1KI.8.26	 “So now, God of Israel,

1KI.9.12	 Hiram left Tyre to see the cities Solomon gave him. However, they didn’t please him. 
1KI.9.13	 “What kind of cities have you given me, brother?” he asked. So he named it the region of Cabul [Good for Nothing]. (⌊They’re⌋ still ⌊called⌋ that today.) 
1KI.9.14	 Hiram had sent the king 9,000 pounds of gold.
1KI.9.15	 This is the record of the forced laborers whom King Solomon drafted to build the L
1KI.9.16	 (The king of Egypt captured Gezer, burned it down, and killed the Canaanites living there. Then he gave it to his daughter, Solomon’s wife, as a wedding present.) 
1KI.9.17	 So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, Lower Beth Horon, 
1KI.9.18	 Baalath, Tadmor in the desert (inside the country), and 
1KI.9.19	 all the storage cities that he owned. He also built cities for his chariots, cities for his war horses, and whatever ⌊else⌋ he wanted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, or the entire territory that he governed.
1KI.9.20	 The Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites had been left ⌊in the land⌋ because the Israelites had not been able to claim them for God by destroying them.
1KI.9.21	 but they had descendants who were still in the land. Solomon drafted them for slave labor. (They are still ⌊slaves⌋ today.) 
1KI.9.22	 But Solomon didn’t make any of the Israelites slaves. Instead, they were soldiers, officials, officers, generals, and commanders of his chariot and cavalry units.
1KI.9.23	 These were the officers in charge of Solomon’s projects: 550 foremen for the people who did the work.
1KI.9.24	 Pharaoh’s daughter moved from the City of David to the palace that Solomon had built for her. Then he built the Millo.
1KI.9.25	 Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he built for the L
1KI.9.26	 King Solomon also built a fleet near the Red Sea coast at Ezion Geber by Elath in Edom. 
1KI.9.27	 Hiram sent his own servants ⌊who were⌋ experienced seamen with the fleet. Along with Solomon’s servants 
1KI.9.28	 they went to Ophir, got 31,500 pounds of gold, and brought it to King Solomon.
1KI.10.1	 The queen of Sheba heard about Solomon’s reputation. (He owed his reputation to the name of the L
1KI.10.2	 She arrived in Jerusalem with a large group of servants, with camels carrying spices, a very large quantity of gold, and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she talked to him about everything she had on her mind. 
1KI.10.3	 Solomon answered all her questions. No question was too difficult for the king to answer.
1KI.10.4	 When the queen of Sheba saw all of Solomon’s wisdom, the palace he built,

1KI.10.8	 How blessed your men must be! How blessed these servants of yours must be because they are always stationed in front of you, listening to your wisdom! 
1KI.10.9	 Thank the L
1KI.10.10	 She gave the king 9,000 pounds of gold, a very large quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again was such a large quantity of spices brought ⌊into Israel⌋ as those that the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.
1KI.10.11	 Hiram’s fleet that brought gold from Ophir also brought a large quantity of sandalwood and precious stones from Ophir. 
1KI.10.12	 With the sandalwood the king made supports for the L
1KI.10.13	 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba anything she wanted, whatever she asked for, besides what he had given her out of his royal generosity. Then she and her servants went back to her country.
1KI.10.14	 The gold that came to Solomon in one year weighed 49,950 pounds, 
1KI.10.15	 not counting ⌊the gold⌋ which came from the merchants, the traders’ profits, all the Arab kings, and the governors of the country.
1KI.10.16	 King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold, using 15 pounds of gold on each shield. 
1KI.10.17	 He also made 300 small shields of hammered gold, using four pounds of gold on each shield. The king put them in the hall ⌊which he called⌋ the Forest of Lebanon.
1KI.10.18	 The king also made a large ivory throne and covered it with fine gold. 
1KI.10.19	 Six steps led to the throne. Carved into the back of the throne was a calf’s head. There were armrests on both sides of the seat. Two lions stood beside the armrests. 
1KI.10.20	 Twelve lions stood on six steps, one on each side. Nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.
1KI.10.21	 All King Solomon’s cups were gold, and all the utensils for the hall ⌊which he called⌋ the Forest of Lebanon were fine gold. (Nothing was silver, because it wasn’t considered valuable in Solomon’s time.) 
1KI.10.22	 The king had a fleet headed for Tarshish with Hiram’s fleet. Once every three years the Tarshish fleet would bring gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys.
1KI.10.23	 In wealth and wisdom King Solomon was greater than all the ⌊other⌋ kings of the world. 
1KI.10.24	 The whole world wanted to listen to the wisdom that God gave Solomon. 
1KI.10.25	 So everyone who came brought him gifts: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This happened year after year.
1KI.10.26	 Solomon built up ⌊his army⌋ with chariots and war horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 war horses. He stationed ⌊some⌋ in chariot cities and ⌊others⌋ with himself in Jerusalem. 
1KI.10.27	 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as plentiful as fig trees in the foothills.
1KI.10.28	 Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue. The king’s traders bought them from Kue for a fixed price. 
1KI.10.29	 Each chariot was imported from Egypt for 15 pounds of silver and each horse for 6 ounces of silver. For the same price they obtained horses to export to all the Hittite and Aramean kings.
1KI.11.1	 King Solomon loved many foreign women in addition to Pharaoh’s daughter. He loved Hittite women and women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidon. 
1KI.11.2	 They came from the nations about which the L

1KI.11.5	 Solomon followed Astarte (the goddess of the Sidonians) and Milcom (the disgusting idol of the Ammonites). 
1KI.11.6	 So Solomon did what the L
1KI.11.7	 Then Solomon built an illegal worship site on the hill east of Jerusalem for Chemosh (the disgusting idol of Moab) and for Molech (the disgusting idol of the Ammonites). 
1KI.11.8	 He did these things for each of his foreign wives who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
1KI.11.9	 So the L

1KI.11.12	 But I will not do it in your lifetime because of your father David. I will tear it away from the hands of your son. 
1KI.11.13	 However, I will not tear the whole kingdom away from you. I will give your son one tribe for my servant David’s sake and for the sake of Jerusalem, ⌊the city⌋ that I chose.”

1KI.11.15	 When David had conquered Edom, Joab, the commander of the army, went to bury those killed in battle and killed every male in Edom. 
1KI.11.16	 (Joab and all Israel stayed there six months until they had destroyed every male in Edom.) 
1KI.11.17	 Hadad was a young boy at the time. He and some of his father’s Edomite servants fled to Egypt. 
1KI.11.18	 They left Midian and went to Paran. Taking some men from Paran with them, they went to Pharaoh (the king of Egypt). Pharaoh gave Hadad a home, a food allowance, and land.
1KI.11.19	 Pharaoh approved of Hadad. So he gave Hadad his sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, to be Hadad’s wife. 
1KI.11.20	 Tahpenes’ sister had a son ⌊named⌋ Genubath. Tahpenes presented the boy to Pharaoh in the palace, and Genubath lived in the palace among Pharaoh’s children.
1KI.11.21	 When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had lain down in death with his ancestors and that Joab, the commander of the army, had died, he said to Pharaoh, “Let me go to my own country.”
1KI.11.22	 Pharaoh asked him, “What don’t you have here that makes you eager to go home?”
1KI.11.22	“Nothing,” he said. “But let me leave anyway.”
1KI.11.23	 God also raised up Rezon, son of Eliada, as a rival to Solomon. Rezon fled from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah, 
1KI.11.24	 after David killed the men of Zobah. Rezon gathered men and became the leader of a troop of warriors. They went to Damascus, settled there, and ruled a kingdom in Damascus. 
1KI.11.25	 In addition to the trouble that Hadad caused, Rezon was Israel’s rival as long as Solomon lived. He ruled Aram and despised Israel.
1KI.11.26	 There was also Jer o boam, who was the son of Nebat and an Ephrathite from Zeredah. His mother Zeruah was a widow. He was one of Solomon’s officers, but he rebelled against the king.
1KI.11.27	 This was the situation when he rebelled against the king: Solomon was building the Millo 
1KI.11.28	 Solomon saw that Jer o boam was a very able and hardworking man. So he put Jer o boam in charge of all forced labor from the tribes of Joseph.
1KI.11.29	 At that time Jer o boam left Jerusalem. The prophet Ahijah from Shiloh met him on the road. The two of them were alone in the open country, and Ahijah had on new clothes. 
1KI.11.30	 Ahijah took his new garment and tore it into 12 pieces.
1KI.11.31	 He told Jer o boam, “Take 10 pieces because this is what the L
1KI.11.32	 He will have one tribe ⌊left⌋ because of my servant David and Jerusalem, the city I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel. 
1KI.11.33	 I will do this because he has abandoned me and worshiped Astarte (the goddess of the Sidonians), Chemosh (the god of Moab), and Milcom (the god of Ammon). He has not followed my ways. He did not do what I consider right or keep my laws and decrees as his father David did.
1KI.11.34	 “I will not take the whole kingdom from him. Instead, I will allow him to be ruler as long as he lives because of my servant David whom I chose, who obeyed my commands and laws. 
1KI.11.35	 But I will take the kingdom away from his son and give you ten tribes. 
1KI.11.36	 I will give his son one tribe so that my servant David will always have a lamp in my presence in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to place my name.
1KI.11.37	 “I will choose you so that you can rule everything you desire. You will be king of Israel. 
1KI.11.38	 If you will do all I command you, follow my ways, and do what I consider right by obeying my laws and commands as my servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build a permanent dynasty for you as I did for David. And I will give you Israel. 
1KI.11.39	 I will make David’s descendants suffer for this, but not always.”
1KI.11.40	 Then Solomon tried to kill Jer o boam, but Jer o boam fled to King Shishak of Egypt. He stayed in Egypt until Solomon died.
1KI.11.41	 Aren’t the rest of Solomon’s acts—everything he did—and his wisdom written in the records of Solomon? 
1KI.11.42	 The length of Solomon’s reign in Jerusalem over all Israel was 40 years. 
1KI.11.43	 Solomon lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. His son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.
1KI.12.1	 Rehoboam went to Shechem because all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	 Jer o boam (Nebat’s son) was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon. When he heard ⌊about Rehoboam⌋, he returned from Egypt.
1KI.12.3	 ⌊Israel⌋ sent for Jer o boam and invited him back. Jer o boam and the entire assembly of Israel went to speak to Rehoboam. They said, 
1KI.12.4	 “Your father made us carry a heavy burden. Reduce the hard work and lighten the heavy burden he put on us, and we will serve you.”
1KI.12.5	 He said to them, “Leave and come back the day after tomorrow.” So the people left.
1KI.12.6	 King Rehoboam sought advice from the older leaders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive. He asked, “What do you advise? How should I respond to these people?”
1KI.12.7	 They told him, “If you will serve these people today, humble yourself, and speak gently, then they will always be your servants.”
1KI.12.8	 But he ignored the advice the older leaders gave him. He sought advice from the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. 
1KI.12.9	 He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we respond to these people who are asking me to lighten the burden my father put on them?”
1KI.12.10	 The young men who had grown up with him answered, “This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is heavier than my father’s whole body.
1KI.12.11	 If my father put a heavy burden on you, I will add to it. If my father punished you with whips, I will punish you with scorpions.’ ”
1KI.12.12	 So Jer o boam and all the people came back to Rehoboam two days later, as the king had instructed them. 
1KI.12.13	 The king answered the people harshly. He ignored the advice the older leaders gave him. 
1KI.12.14	 He spoke to them as the young men advised. He said, “If my father made your burden heavy, I will add to it. If my father punished you with whips, I will punish you with scorpions.” 
1KI.12.15	 The king refused to listen to the people because the L
1KI.12.16	 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king,
1KI.12.16	“What share do we have in David’s kingdom?
1KI.12.16	We won’t receive an inheritance from Jesse’s son.
1KI.12.16	To your own tents, Israel!
1KI.12.16	Now look after your own house, David!”
1KI.12.16	So Israel went home to their own tents. 
1KI.12.17	 But Rehoboam ruled the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.
1KI.12.18	 Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram to Israel. He was in charge of forced labor, but they stoned him to death. So King Rehoboam got on his chariot as fast as he could and fled to Jerusalem. 
1KI.12.19	 Israel has rebelled against David’s dynasty to this day.
1KI.12.20	 When all Israel heard that Jer o boam had returned, they sent men to invite him to the assembly. They made him king of all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to David’s dynasty.
1KI.12.21	 When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he gathered all the people of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 of the best soldiers, to fight against the people of Israel and return the kingdom to Rehoboam, son of Solomon.
1KI.12.22	 But God spoke his word to Shemaiah, the man of God. He said, 
1KI.12.23	 “Speak to Judah’s King Rehoboam, son of Solomon, and all the people of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people. 
1KI.12.24	 This is what the L
1KI.12.25	 Jer o boam rebuilt Shechem in the hills of Ephraim and lived there. Then he left that place and built Penuel. 
1KI.12.26	 He said to himself, “The kingdom will probably return to David’s dynasty now. 
1KI.12.27	 King Rehoboam of Judah, the former master of these people, will regain popularity if they go to sacrifice in the L
1KI.12.28	 After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said, “You’ve been worshiping in Jerusalem long enough. Israel, here are your gods who brought you out of Egypt.” 
1KI.12.29	 He put one in Bethel and the other in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	 Worshiping them became ⌊Israel’s⌋ sin. The people went as far as Dan to worship the one calf. 
1KI.12.31	 Jer o boam built worship sites on hilltops. He appointed men who were not descended from Levi to be priests.
1KI.12.32	 Jer o boam appointed a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, just like the festival in Judah. He went to the altar in Bethel to sacrifice to the calves he had made. He appointed priests from the illegal worship sites ⌊to serve⌋ in Bethel. 
1KI.12.33	 He went to his altar in Bethel to burn an offering on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, ⌊the festival⌋ he had invented for the Israelites.
1KI.13.1	 A man of God from Judah had come to Bethel. When he arrived, Jer o boam was standing at the altar to offer a sacrifice.

1KI.13.4	 When King Jer o boam heard the man of God condemning the altar in Bethel, he pointed to the man across the altar. “Arrest him,” he said. But the arm that he used to point to the man of God was paralyzed so that he couldn’t pull it back. 
1KI.13.5	 The altar was torn apart, and the ashes from the altar were poured ⌊on the ground⌋. This was the miraculous sign the man of God performed at the L
1KI.13.6	 Then the king asked the man of God, “Please make an appeal to the L
1KI.13.7	 The king told the man of God, “Come home with me; have something to eat and drink, and I will give you a gift.”

1KI.13.11	 An old prophet was living in Bethel. His sons told him everything the man of God did in Bethel that day and the exact words he had spoken to the king. When they told their father, 
1KI.13.12	 he said to them, “Which road did he take?” (His sons had seen which road the man of God from Judah had taken.) 
1KI.13.13	 The old prophet told his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” After they had saddled the donkey for him, he got on it.
1KI.13.14	 He went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree. The old prophet asked him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?”
1KI.13.14	“Yes,” he answered.
1KI.13.15	 “Come home with me, and eat a meal,” the old prophet replied.
1KI.13.16	 The man of God said, “I’m not allowed to go back with you. I’m not allowed to eat or drink with you.

1KI.13.23	 After the old prophet had something to eat and drink, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
1KI.13.24	 The man of God left. A lion found him ⌊as he traveled⌋ on the road and killed him. His dead body was thrown on the road. The donkey and the lion were standing by the body. 
1KI.13.25	 People who passed by saw the body lying on the road and the lion standing by the body. They talked about it in the city where the old prophet was living.

1KI.13.27	 Then the old prophet told his sons to saddle his donkey for him. So they did.
1KI.13.28	 He found the body of the man thrown on the road. He also found the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had not eaten the body, nor had it torn the donkey to pieces. 
1KI.13.29	 The old prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. He came to his own city to mourn for him and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	 He laid the body of the man of God in his own tomb and mourned over the man, saying, “Oh no, my brother, my brother!” 
1KI.13.31	 After he had buried the man of God, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the tomb where the man of God was buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.

1KI.13.34	 Appointing illegal priests became the sin of Jer o boam’s family so that it had to be destroyed and wiped off the face of the earth.

1KI.15.1	 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jer o boam (Nebat’s son), Abijam began to rule Judah.

1KI.15.20	 Benhadad did what King Asa requested. He sent his generals and their armies to attack the cities of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah, and the entire area around Chinneroth with the entire territory of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	 When Baasha heard the news, he stopped fortifying Ramah and lived in Tirzah. 
1KI.15.22	 Then King Asa drafted everyone in Judah and excused no one. He made them carry the stones and lumber from Ramah. Baasha had been using those to fortify the city. King Asa used the materials to fortify Geba in Benjamin and Mizpah.

1KI.16.22	 But the half which followed Omri was stronger than the half which followed Tibni, Ginath’s son. Tibni died, and Omri became king. 
1KI.16.23	 Omri began to rule Israel in Asa’s thirty-first year as king of Judah. He ruled for 12 years, 6 of them in Tirzah.
1KI.16.24	 Omri bought a hill from Shemer for 150 pounds of silver. He fortified the hill and built the city of Samaria on it. He named the city after its former owner, Shemer.

1KI.18.26	 They took the bull he gave them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon. They said, “Baal, answer us!” But there wasn’t a sound or an answer. So they danced around the altar they had made. 
1KI.18.27	 At noon Elijah started to make fun of them. “Shout louder, since he is a god. Maybe he’s thinking, relieving himself, or traveling! Maybe he’s sleeping, and you have to wake him!”
1KI.18.28	 So they shouted louder. They also cut themselves with swords and spears until their blood flowed. (This is what their ritual called for.) 
1KI.18.29	 In the afternoon they continued to rant and rave until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no sound, no answer, no attention given to them.

1KI.18.35	 The water flowed around the altar, and even the trench was filled with water.

1KI.18.41	 Then Elijah told Ahab, “Get up, eat, and drink. It sounds like a heavy rain ⌊is coming⌋.” 
1KI.18.42	 Ahab got up to eat and drink.
1KI.18.42	Elijah went to the top of Carmel and bowed down on the ground to pray. 
1KI.18.43	 He said to his servant, “Please go back to ⌊Mount Carmel⌋, and look toward the sea.”

1KI.18.43	Seven times Elijah told him, “Go back.”
1KI.18.44	 After the seventh time the servant said, “A little cloud like a man’s hand is coming from the sea.”
1KI.18.44	Elijah said, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Prepare ⌊your chariot⌋, and leave before the rain delays you.’ ”

1KI.19.3	 Frightened, Elijah fled to save his life. He came to Beersheba in Judah and left his servant there.

1KI.19.19	 Elijah found Elisha, son of Shaphat. Elisha was plowing behind 12 pairs of oxen. He was using the twelfth pair. Elijah took off his coat and put it on Elisha. 
1KI.19.20	 So Elisha left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye. Then I will follow you.”
1KI.19.20	“Go back,” Elijah answered him. “I’m not stopping you.”
1KI.19.21	 Elisha left him, took two oxen, and butchered them. He boiled the meat, using the oxen’s yoke 
1KI.20.1	 King Benhadad of Aram gathered together his whole army. With him were 32 kings along with their horses and chariots. He went to blockade Samaria and fight against it. 
1KI.20.2	 He sent messengers into the city to King Ahab of Israel. They told Ahab, “This is what Benhadad says: 
1KI.20.3	 Your silver and gold are mine. Your beloved wives and children are mine.”
1KI.20.4	 The king of Israel answered, “As you say, Your Majesty. I and everything I have are yours.”
1KI.20.5	 But Benhadad sent messengers back ⌊to Ahab⌋. They said, “Benhadad has sent this message to you: ‘Your silver, gold, wives, and children are mine. Give ⌊them to me⌋. 
1KI.20.6	 At this time tomorrow I’m going to send my servants to search your palace and your servants’ houses. They will take anything that you consider valuable.’ ”
1KI.20.7	 Then the king of Israel called for all the leaders of the country. He said, “You can see how this man is looking for trouble. When he sent for my wives, children, silver, and gold, I didn’t refuse him.”
1KI.20.8	 All the leaders and all the people told him, “Don’t listen to him. Don’t agree ⌊to his demands⌋.”
1KI.20.9	 Ahab told Benhadad’s messengers, “Tell His Majesty, ‘I did everything your messengers told me the first time, but I can’t do this.’” The messengers left to take back his answer.
1KI.20.10	 Then Benhadad sent Ahab the following message: “May the gods strike me dead if there will be enough dust left from Samaria to give a handful to each soldier who follows me.”
1KI.20.11	 The king of Israel answered, “The saying goes, ‘Don’t brag about a victory before you have even dressed for battle.’ ”
1KI.20.12	 Benhadad heard this as he and his allies were drinking in their tents. He told his officers to get ready. So they got ready ⌊to attack⌋ the city.
1KI.20.13	 Then a prophet came to King Ahab of Israel and said, “This is what the L
1KI.20.14	 Ahab asked, “How ⌊will this be done⌋?”
1KI.20.14	The prophet answered, “This is what the L
1KI.20.14	“Who will start the battle?” Ahab asked.
1KI.20.14	“You will,” the prophet answered.
1KI.20.15	 Ahab counted the young officers of the district governors. There were 232. After counting them, he counted all the Israelite soldiers. There were 7,000. 
1KI.20.16	 They attacked at noon, when Benhadad was in his tent getting drunk with the 32 kings who were his allies. 
1KI.20.17	 The young officers of the district governors went out first.
1KI.20.17	Benhadad had sent men ⌊to watch the city⌋. They informed him that some men had come out of Samaria.
1KI.20.18	 He said, “Take them alive, whether they have come out to make peace or to fight.”
1KI.20.19	 The young officers of the district governors led an attack, and the troops followed them. 
1KI.20.20	 Each officer killed his opponent. The Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them. King Benhadad of Aram escaped on a horse with the cavalry. 
1KI.20.21	 The king of Israel went out and destroyed the horses and chariots and decisively defeated the Arameans.
1KI.20.22	 Then the prophet came to the king of Israel and said, “Reinforce your army. Consider what you have to do. When spring comes, the king of Aram will attack ⌊again⌋.”
1KI.20.23	 Meanwhile, the officers of King Benhadad of Aram told him, “Their god is a god of the hills. That is why they were stronger than we were. However, if we fight them on the plain, we will be stronger than they are. 
1KI.20.24	 This is what we must do: Remove all of the kings from their positions, and substitute governors for them. 
1KI.20.25	 Recruit an army with as many horses and chariots as the one which was defeated. Then, if we fight them on the plain, we will be stronger than they are.” He took their advice and followed it.
1KI.20.26	 Spring came, and Benhadad organized the Aramean army and went to Aphek to fight Israel. 
1KI.20.27	 When the Israelite ⌊troops⌋ had been organized and given provisions, they went to meet the enemy. The Israelites, while camped opposite the Arameans who filled the country, seemed like two newborn goats.
1KI.20.28	 The man of God came again. He said to the king of Israel, “This is what the L
1KI.20.29	 They camped facing one another for seven days, and on the seventh day the battle started. The Israelites killed 100,000 Aramean foot soldiers in one day. 
1KI.20.30	 The survivors fled to Aphek, the city where the wall fell on 27,000 of them. Benhadad had also fled. He came to the city and hid in an inner room.
1KI.20.31	 His officers told him, “We have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful. Allow us to dress in sackcloth, put ropes around our necks, and go to the king of Israel. Maybe he’ll let you live.” 
1KI.20.32	 So they dressed in sackcloth and put ropes around their necks. They went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Benhadad says, ‘Please let me live.’”
1KI.20.32	Ahab asked, “He’s still alive? He’s my brother.”
1KI.20.33	 The men, watching for a good sign, were quick to take him at his word. “Benhadad is your brother,” they said.
1KI.20.33	Ahab said, “Bring him here.” When Benhadad arrived, Ahab had him come up on the chariot with him.
1KI.20.34	 Benhadad told him, “I will give back the towns my father took from your father. You may set up trading centers in Damascus as my father did in Samaria.”
1KI.20.34	Ahab said, “If you will put this into a treaty, I will let you go.” So Ahab made a treaty with Benhadad and let him go.
1KI.20.35	 A disciple of the prophets spoke to a friend as the word of the L
1KI.20.36	 The disciple said, “Since you didn’t obey the L
1KI.20.37	 Then the disciple found another man. He said, “Punch me.” The man punched him hard and wounded him.
1KI.20.38	 Then the prophet, disguised with a bandage over his eyes, waited for the king by the road. 
1KI.20.39	 When the king passed by, the disciple called to him. “I went to fight in the battle. A man turned around and brought a prisoner to me. He said, ‘Guard this prisoner. If he gets away, you will pay for his life with your own life or be fined 75 pounds of silver.’ 
1KI.20.40	 But while I was busy doing other things, he got away.”
1KI.20.40	The king of Israel told him, “That’s your own penalty. You have determined it yourself.”
1KI.20.41	 Then he quickly took the bandage off his eyes. The king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
1KI.20.42	 The prophet told him, “This is what the L
1KI.20.43	 Resentful and upset, the king of Israel went home to Samaria.
1KI.21.1	 This is what happened next. Naboth from Jezreel had a vineyard in Jezreel next to the palace of King Ahab of Samaria.
1KI.21.2	 Ahab told Naboth, “Give me your vineyard. It will become my vegetable garden because it is near my house. I will give you a better vineyard for it. Or if you prefer, I will pay you a fair price for it.”
1KI.21.3	 Naboth told Ahab, “The L
1KI.21.4	 Resentful and upset, Ahab went home because of what Naboth from Jezreel had told him. (⌊Naboth had said,⌋ “I will not give you what I inherited from my ancestors.”) So Ahab lay on the couch, turned his face ⌊from everyone⌋, and refused to eat.
1KI.21.5	 His wife Jezbel came to him and asked, “Why are you so resentful of everything? Why don’t you eat?”
1KI.21.6	 He told her, “I talked to Naboth from Jezreel. I said to him, ‘Sell me your vineyard. Or, if you like, I’ll give you another vineyard for it.’ But he said, ‘I won’t give you my vineyard.’ ”
1KI.21.7	 His wife Jezbel said to him, “Aren’t you king of Israel? Get up, eat, and cheer up. I’ll give you the vineyard belonging to Naboth from Jezreel.”
1KI.21.8	 So Jezbel wrote letters, signed them with Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal. She sent them to the respected leaders and nobles living in Naboth’s city. 
1KI.21.9	 In these letters she wrote: “Announce a fast. Seat Naboth as leader of the people. 
1KI.21.10	 Have two good-for-nothing men sit opposite him and accuse him of cursing God and the king. Then stone him to death outside the city.”
1KI.21.11	 The men in Naboth’s city—the respected leaders and nobles who lived there—did what Jezbel asked them to do. They did just as she had written in the letters she sent. 
1KI.21.12	 They announced a fast and had Naboth seated as the leader of the people. 
1KI.21.13	 The two good-for-nothing men came in and sat opposite him. In front of the people, these men accused Naboth of cursing God and the king. So the people stoned him to death outside the city. 
1KI.21.14	 Then the leaders sent ⌊this message⌋ to Jezbel: “Naboth has been stoned to death.”
1KI.21.15	 Jezbel received the message and said to Ahab, “Get up! Confiscate the vineyard which Naboth from Jezreel refused to sell you. He’s dead now.”
1KI.21.16	 When he heard about Naboth’s death, Ahab went to confiscate the vineyard.
1KI.21.17	 Then the L
1KI.21.18	 “Go, meet King Ahab of Israel, who lives in Samaria. He went to confiscate Naboth’s vineyard.

1KI.21.20	Elijah answered, “I found you. Because you sold yourself to do what the L
1KI.21.21	 So I am going to bring evil on you. I will destroy your descendants. I will destroy every male 
1KI.21.22	 I will make your family like the family of Jer o boam (Nebat’s son) and like the house of Baasha, son of Ahijah, because you made me furious. You led Israel to sin.”
1KI.21.23	 Then the L
1KI.21.24	 If anyone from Ahab’s ⌊house⌋ dies in the city, dogs will eat him. If anyone dies in the country, birds will eat him.”
1KI.21.25	 There was no one else like Ahab. At the urging of his wife, he sold himself to do what the L
1KI.21.26	 He did many disgusting things as a result of worshiping idols as the Amorites had done. (The L
1KI.21.27	 When Ahab heard these things, he tore his clothes ⌊in distress⌋ and dressed in sackcloth. He fasted, lay in sackcloth, and walked around depressed.
1KI.21.28	 Then the L
1KI.21.29	 “Do you see how Ahab is humbling himself in my presence? Because he’s humbling himself in my presence, I will not let any evil happen to his family while he is alive. I will bring evil on it during his son’s lifetime.”
1KI.22.1	 For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel. 
1KI.22.2	 In the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit the king of Israel.
1KI.22.3	 The king of Israel asked his staff, “Do you know that Ramoth in Gilead belongs to us, and we are doing nothing to take it back from the king of Aram?” 
1KI.22.4	 Then he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth in Gilead?”
1KI.22.4	Jehoshaphat told the king of Israel, “I will do what you do. My troops will do what your troops do. My horses will do what your horses do.” 
1KI.22.5	 Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “But first, find out what the word of the L
1KI.22.6	 So the king of Israel called 400 prophets together. He asked them, “Should I go to war against Ramoth in Gilead or not?”
1KI.22.6	“Go,” they said. “The Lord 
1KI.22.7	 But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of the L
1KI.22.8	 The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, “We can ask the L
1KI.22.8	Jehoshaphat answered, “The king must not say that.”
1KI.22.9	 The king of Israel called for an officer and said, “Quick! ⌊Get⌋ Micaiah, son of Imlah!”
1KI.22.10	 The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were dressed in royal robes and seated on thrones. They were on the threshing floor 
1KI.22.11	 Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said, “This is what the L
1KI.22.12	 All the other prophets made the same prophecy. They said, “Attack Ramoth in Gilead, and you will win. The L
1KI.22.13	 The messenger who went to call Micaiah told him, “The prophets have all told the king the same good message. Make your message agree with their message. Say something good.”
1KI.22.14	 Micaiah answered, “I solemnly swear, as the L
1KI.22.15	 When he came to the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth in Gilead or not?”
1KI.22.15	Micaiah said to him, “Attack and you will win. The L
1KI.22.16	 The king asked him, “How many times must I make you take an oath in the L
1KI.22.17	 So Micaiah said, “I saw Israel’s troops scattered in the hills like sheep without a shepherd. The L
1KI.22.18	 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you he wouldn’t prophesy anything good about me, only evil?”
1KI.22.19	 Micaiah added, “Then hear the word of the L

1KI.22.25	 Micaiah answered, “You will find out on the day you go into an inner room to hide.”
1KI.22.26	 The king of Israel then said, “Send Micaiah back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the prince. 
1KI.22.27	 Say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I come home safely.’ ”
1KI.22.28	 Micaiah said, “If you really do come back safely, then the L
1KI.22.29	 So the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to Ramoth in Gilead. 
1KI.22.30	 The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you should wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
1KI.22.31	 The king of Aram had given orders to the 32 chariot commanders. He said, “Don’t fight anyone except the king of Israel.”
1KI.22.32	 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “He must be the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight him. But when Jehoshaphat cried out, 
1KI.22.33	 the chariot commanders realized that he wasn’t the king of Israel. They turned away from him.
1KI.22.34	 One man aimed his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between his scale armor and his breastplate. Ahab told his chariot driver, “Turn around, and get me away from these troops. I’m badly wounded.” 
1KI.22.35	 But the battle got worse that day, and the king was kept propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. He died that evening. The blood from the wound had flowed into the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	 At sundown a cry went through the army, “Every man to his own city! Every man to his own property!”
1KI.22.37	 When the king was dead, he was brought to Samaria to be buried. 
1KI.22.38	 His chariot was washed at the pool of Samaria, where the prostitutes bathed. The dogs licked up his blood, as the L
1KI.22.39	 Isn’t everything else about Ahab—everything he did, the ivory palace he built, and all the cities he fortified—written in the official records of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.22.40	 Ahab lay down in death with his ancestors. His son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.
1KI.22.41	 Jehoshaphat, son of Asa, became king of Judah in Ahab’s fourth year as king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	 Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	 Jehoshaphat carefully followed the example his father Asa had set and did what the L
1KI.22.44	 But the illegal worship sites were not torn down. The people continued to sacrifice and burn incense at these worship sites.
1KI.22.45	 Isn’t everything else about Jehoshaphat—the heroic acts he did and ⌊the wars⌋ he fought—written in the official records of the kings of Judah? 
1KI.22.46	 He rid the land of the male temple prostitutes who were left there from the time of his father Asa. 
1KI.22.47	 There was no king in Edom; instead, a deputy ruled.
1KI.22.48	 Jehoshaphat made Tarshish-style ships to go to Ophir for gold. But they didn’t go because the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber. 
1KI.22.49	 Then Ahaziah, son of Ahab, said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat refused.
1KI.22.50	 Jehoshaphat lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of his ancestor David. His son Jehoram succeeded him as king.
1KI.22.51	 Ahaziah, son of Ahab, became king of Israel in Samaria during Jehoshaphat’s seventeenth year as king of Judah. Ahaziah ruled Israel for two years. 
1KI.22.52	 He did what the L

2KI.1.1	 After Ahab died, Moab rebelled against Israel. 
2KI.1.2	 During the rebellion King Ahaziah fell through a window lattice in his upstairs room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers ⌊to Ekron⌋. He had told them, “Go ask Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, if I will recover from this injury.”
2KI.1.3	 Then the angel of the L

2KI.1.5	 When the messengers returned, the king asked them, “Why have you come back so soon?”
2KI.1.6	 They told him that a man came to meet them and said to them, “Go back to the king who sent you. Tell him, ‘This is what the L
2KI.1.7	 The king asked them, “What was the man who told you this like?”
2KI.1.8	 They replied, “He was hairy and had a leather belt around his waist.”
2KI.1.8	“That’s Elijah from Tishbe,” the king answered.
2KI.1.9	 The king sent an army officer with 50 men to Elijah. When the officer found Elijah sitting on top of a hill, he told Elijah, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down.’ ”
2KI.1.10	 Elijah answered the officer, “If I’m a man of God, fire will come from heaven and burn up you and your 50 men.” Then fire came from heaven and burned up the officer and his 50 men.
2KI.1.11	 The king sent another officer with 50 men to Elijah. The officer said, “Man of God, this is what the king says: Come here right away!”
2KI.1.12	 Elijah answered the officer, “If I’m a man of God, fire will come from heaven and burn up you and your 50 men.” Then God’s fire came from heaven and burned up the officer and his 50 men.
2KI.1.13	 The king sent a third officer with 50 men. The officer of the third group went up the hill and knelt in front of Elijah. The officer begged him, “Man of God, please treat my life and the lives of these 50 servants of yours as something precious. 
2KI.1.14	 Fire has come from heaven and burned up the first two officers and their 100 men. But treat my life as something precious.”

2KI.2.7	 Fifty disciples of the prophets stood at a distance as Elijah and Elisha stood by the Jordan River. 
2KI.2.8	 Elijah took his coat, rolled it up, and struck the water with it. The water divided to their left and their right, and the two men crossed ⌊the river⌋ on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	 While they were crossing, Elijah asked Elisha, “What should I do for you before I’m taken from you?”
2KI.2.9	Elisha answered, “Let me inherit a double share of your spirit.”
2KI.2.10	 Elijah said, “You have asked for something difficult. If you see me taken from you, it will be yours. Otherwise, it will not.”
2KI.2.11	 As they continued walking and talking, a fiery chariot with fiery horses separated the two of them, and Elijah went to heaven in a windstorm.
2KI.2.12	 When Elisha saw this, he cried out, “Master! Master! Israel’s chariot and horses!” When he couldn’t see Elijah anymore, he grabbed his own garment and tore it in two ⌊to show his grief⌋. 
2KI.2.13	 Then he picked up Elijah’s coat (which had fallen off Elijah), went back, and stood on the bank of the Jordan River. 
2KI.2.14	 He took the coat and struck the water with it. He asked, “Where is the L
2KI.2.15	 The disciples of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him from a distance. They said, “Elijah’s spirit rests on Elisha!” Then they went to meet him and bowed in front of him with their faces touching the ground.

2KI.2.16	Elisha answered, “Don’t send them ⌊to look⌋.” 
2KI.2.17	 But the disciples kept urging him ⌊to send the men⌋ until he was embarrassed. So he said, “Send them.” They sent 50 men who searched for three days without finding him. 
2KI.2.18	 They returned to Elisha in Jericho, where he was waiting. He said, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?”
2KI.2.19	 The people of the city ⌊of Jericho⌋ told Elisha, “This city’s location is as good as you will ever find. But the water is bad, and the land cannot grow crops.”
2KI.2.20	 Elisha said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” They brought it to him. 
2KI.2.21	 He went to the spring and threw the salt into it. Then he said, “This is what the L
2KI.2.22	 To this day the water is still pure, as Elisha had said.
2KI.2.23	 From there he went to Bethel. As he walked along the road, some boys came out of the city and mocked him. They said, “Go away, baldy! Go away!”
2KI.2.24	 Looking back, he saw them and cursed them in the L
2KI.2.25	 He left that place, went to Mount Carmel, and returned to Samaria.

2KI.3.3	 But he would not give up the sins that Jer o boam (Nebat’s son) led Israel to commit. Joram would not turn away from those sins.
2KI.3.4	 King Mesha of Moab raised sheep. ⌊Each year⌋ he had to pay the king of Israel 100,000 male lambs and the wool from 100,000 rams. 
2KI.3.5	 But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the ⌊new⌋ king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	 King Joram immediately left Samaria to prepare Israel’s army for war. 
2KI.3.7	 He sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you fight Moab with me?”
2KI.3.7	Jehoshaphat answered, “I’ll go. I will do what you do. My troops will do what your troops do. My horses will do what your horses do.”
2KI.3.8	 Joram asked, “Which road should we take?”
2KI.3.8	Jehoshaphat answered, “The road through the desert of Edom.”
2KI.3.9	 So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom took an indirect route ⌊to Moab⌋. After seven days they ran out of water for the army and the animals.

2KI.3.20	 That is what happened in the morning. At the time of the grain offering, water flowed from Edom and filled the countryside.
2KI.3.21	 All the people of Moab heard that the kings had come to fight them. So all men old enough to bear arms were called to fight. They stood at the border. 
2KI.3.22	 When the Moabites got up early in the morning as the sun was rising over the water, they saw the water from a distance. It was as red as blood. 
2KI.3.23	 They said, “It’s blood! The kings have been fighting one another and have killed each other. Now, Moabites, let’s take their goods!”
2KI.3.24	 So when the Moabites came to Israel’s camp, the Israelites attacked them, and they fled from the Israelites. Israel went after the Moabites and defeated them. 
2KI.3.25	 Then Israel tore down the cities, each man throwing rocks on every good field until it was covered. They sealed every well and cut down every good tree. Only the stones ⌊in the walls⌋ of Kir Hareseth were left. Soldiers surrounded Kir Hareseth and attacked it with slings and stones. 
2KI.3.26	 When the king of Moab saw he was losing the battle, he took 700 swordsmen to try to break through to the king of Edom. But they couldn’t do it. 
2KI.3.27	 Then he took his firstborn son, who would have succeeded him as king, and sacrificed him on the wall as a burnt offering. There was bitter anger against the Israelites. So they went home to their own country.
2KI.4.1	 One of the wives of a disciple of the prophets called to Elisha, “Sir, my husband is dead! You know how he feared the L
2KI.4.2	 Elisha asked her, “What should I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?”
2KI.4.2	She answered, “I have nothing in the house except a jar of olive oil.”
2KI.4.3	 Elisha said, “Borrow many empty containers from all your neighbors. 
2KI.4.4	 Then close the door behind you and your children, and pour oil into all those containers. When one is full, set it aside.”
2KI.4.5	 So she left him and closed the door behind her and her children. The children kept bringing containers to her, and she kept pouring. 
2KI.4.6	 When the containers were full, she told her son, “Bring me another container.”
2KI.4.6	He told her, “There are no more containers.” So the olive oil stopped flowing. 
2KI.4.7	 She went and told the man of God.
2KI.4.7	He said, “Sell the oil, and pay your debt. The rest is for you and your children.”
2KI.4.8	 One day Elisha was traveling through Shunem, where a rich woman lived. She had invited him to eat ⌊with her⌋. So whenever he was in the area, he stopped in to eat.
2KI.4.9	 She told her husband, “I know he’s a holy man of God. And he regularly travels past our house. 
2KI.4.10	 Let’s make a small room on the roof and put a bed, table, chair, and lamp stand there for him. He can stay there whenever he comes to visit us.”
2KI.4.11	 One day he came ⌊to their house⌋, went into the upstairs room, and rested there. 
2KI.4.12	 He told his servant Gehazi, “Call this Shunem woman.”
2KI.4.12	Gehazi called her, and she stood in front of him. 
2KI.4.13	 Elisha said to Gehazi, “Ask her what we can do for her, since she has gone to a lot of trouble for us. Maybe she would like us to speak to the king or the commander of the army for her.”
2KI.4.13	She answered, “I’m already living among my own people.”
2KI.4.14	 “What should we do for her?” Elisha asked.
2KI.4.14	Gehazi answered, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.”
2KI.4.15	 Elisha said, “Call her.” So Gehazi called her, and she stood in the doorway. 
2KI.4.16	 Elisha said, “At this time next spring, you will hold a baby boy in your arms.”
2KI.4.16	She answered, “Don’t say that, sir. Don’t lie to me. You’re a man of God.”
2KI.4.17	 But the woman became pregnant and had a son at that time next year, as Elisha had told her.
2KI.4.18	 Several years later the boy went to his father, who was with the harvest workers. 
2KI.4.19	 ⌊Suddenly,⌋ he said to his father, “My head! My head!”
2KI.4.19	The father told his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”
2KI.4.20	 The servant picked him up and brought him to his mother. The boy sat on her lap until noon, when he died. 
2KI.4.21	 She took him upstairs and laid him on the bed of the man of God, left ⌊the room⌋, and shut the door behind her. 
2KI.4.22	 She called her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys. I will go quickly to the man of God and come back again.”
2KI.4.23	 Her husband asked, “Why are you going to him today? It isn’t a New Moon Festival or a day of worship.”
2KI.4.23	But she said goodbye to him.
2KI.4.24	 She saddled the donkey. Then she told her servant, “Lead on. Don’t slow down unless I tell you.” 
2KI.4.25	 So she came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.
2KI.4.25	When he saw her coming at a distance, he told his servant Gehazi, “There is the woman from Shunem. 
2KI.4.26	 Run to meet her and ask her how she, her husband, and the boy are doing.”
2KI.4.26	“Everyone’s fine,” she answered.
2KI.4.27	 When she came to the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi went to push her away. But the man of God said, “Leave her alone. She is bitter. The L
2KI.4.28	 The woman said, “I didn’t ask you for a son. I said, ‘Don’t raise my hopes.’ ”
2KI.4.29	 The man of God told Gehazi, “Put on a belt, take my shepherd’s staff in your hand, and go. Whenever you meet anyone, don’t stop to greet him. If he greets you, don’t stop to answer him. Lay my staff on the boy’s face.”
2KI.4.30	 The boy’s mother said, “I solemnly swear, as the L
2KI.4.31	 Gehazi went ahead of them and put the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or sign of life. So Gehazi came back to meet the man of God. Gehazi told him, “The boy didn’t wake up.”
2KI.4.32	 When Elisha came to the house, the dead boy was lying on Elisha’s bed. 
2KI.4.33	 He went into the room, closed the door, and prayed to the L
2KI.4.34	 Then he lay on the boy, putting his mouth on the boy’s mouth, his eyes on the boy’s eyes, his hands on the boy’s hands. He crouched over the boy’s body, and it became warm. 
2KI.4.35	 Elisha got up, walked across the room and came back, and then got back on the bed and crouched over him. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. 
2KI.4.36	 Elisha called Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunem woman.” Gehazi called her. When she came to him, he said, “Take your son.”
2KI.4.37	 Then she immediately bowed at his feet. She took her son and left.
2KI.4.38	 When Elisha went back to Gilgal, there was a famine in the country. ⌊One day,⌋ while the disciples of the prophets were meeting with him, he told his servant, “Put a large pot on the fire, and cook some stew for the disciples of the prophets.”
2KI.4.39	 One of them went into the field to gather vegetables and found a wild vine. He filled his clothes with wild gourds. Then he cut them into the pot of stew without knowing what they were. 
2KI.4.40	 They dished out the food for the men to eat. As they were eating the stew, they cried out, “There’s death in the pot, man of God!” So they couldn’t eat it.
2KI.4.41	 Elisha said, “Bring some flour.” He threw it into the pot and said, “Dish it out for the people to eat.” Then there was nothing harmful in the pot.
2KI.4.42	 A man from Baal Shalisha brought bread made from the first harvested grain, 20 barley loaves, and fresh grain to the man of God. The man of God said, “Give it to the people to eat.”
2KI.4.43	 But his servant asked, “How can I set this in front of a hundred people?”
2KI.4.43	“Give it to the people to eat,” the man of God said. “This is what the L
2KI.4.44	 The servant set it in front of them. They ate and had some left over, as the L
2KI.5.1	 Naaman, the commander of the Aramean king’s army, was respected and highly honored by his master. The L
2KI.5.2	 Once, when the Arameans went on raids, they had brought back a little girl from Israel. She became the servant of Naaman’s wife. 
2KI.5.3	 The girl told her mistress, “If only my master were with the prophet in Samaria. Then the prophet could cure him of his skin disease.”
2KI.5.4	 Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said.
2KI.5.5	 The king of Aram said, “You may go. I will also send a letter to the king of Israel.” When Naaman left, he took 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold, and 10 sets of clothing with him. 
2KI.5.6	 He brought the letter to the king of Israel. It read, “I’m sending my officer Naaman with this letter. Cure him of his skin disease.”
2KI.5.7	 When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes ⌊in distress⌋. He asked, “Am I God? Can I kill someone and then bring him back to life? This man sends someone to me so that I can cure his skin disease! All of you should realize and understand that he’s trying to pick a fight with me.”
2KI.5.8	 But when Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a messenger to the king. He asked, “Why did you tear your clothes? Please let Naaman come to me and find out that there is a prophet in Israel.”
2KI.5.9	 Naaman came with his horses and chariot and stopped at the entrance to Elisha’s home. 
2KI.5.10	 Elisha sent a messenger to him. He said, “Wash yourself seven times in the Jordan River, and your skin will be healthy and clean.” 
2KI.5.11	 But Naaman became angry and left. He said, “I thought he would at least come out ⌊of his house⌋, stand somewhere, call on the name of the L
2KI.5.12	 The Abana and Pharpar Rivers in Damascus have better water than any of the rivers in Israel. Couldn’t I wash in them and be clean?” So he turned around and left in anger.
2KI.5.13	 But Naaman’s servants went to him and said, “Master, if the prophet had asked you to do some extraordinary act, wouldn’t you have done it? Why shouldn’t you do as he said: ‘Wash and be clean’?”
2KI.5.14	 So he went to dip himself in the Jordan River seven times, as the man of God had instructed him. His skin became healthy again like a little child’s skin. 
2KI.5.15	 Then he and all his men returned to the man of God. Naaman stood in front of Elisha and said, “Now I know that there’s no god in the whole world, except the God of Israel. So please accept a present from me.”
2KI.5.16	 Elisha said, “I solemnly swear, as the L
2KI.5.17	 So Naaman said, “If you won’t take it, please have someone give me as much dirt as a pair of mules can carry. From now on I will sacrifice to the L
2KI.5.18	 May the L
2KI.5.19	 Elisha told Naaman, “Go in peace.”
2KI.5.19	After Elisha had left him and gone some distance, 
2KI.5.20	 Gehazi, the servant of Elisha (the man of God), thought, “My master let this Aramean Naaman go without accepting what he had brought. As sure as the L
2KI.5.21	 So Gehazi went after Naaman. When Naaman saw Gehazi running after him, he got down from his chariot to speak to him. “Is something wrong?” he asked.
2KI.5.22	 Gehazi answered, “No. My master has sent me. He says, ‘Just now two young men from the disciples of the prophets in the hills of Ephraim have arrived. Please give them 75 pounds of silver and two sets of clothing.’ ”
2KI.5.23	 Naaman replied, “Please let me give you 150 pounds of silver.” Naaman urged him ⌊to take the silver⌋. Naaman tied up 150 pounds of silver in two bags with two sets of clothing. He gave them to a couple of his own servants to carry in front of Gehazi.
2KI.5.24	 When Gehazi came to the Ophel in Samaria, he took these things and put them away in the house. Then he dismissed the men, and they left. 
2KI.5.25	 He went and stood in front of his master.
2KI.5.25	Elisha asked him, “Where were you, Gehazi?”
2KI.5.25	“I didn’t go anywhere,” he answered.
2KI.5.26	 Then Elisha said to him, “I went with you in spirit when the man turned around in his chariot to speak to you. How could you accept silver, clothes, olive orchards, vineyards, sheep, cattle, or slaves? 
2KI.5.27	 Naaman’s skin disease will cling to you and your descendants permanently!”
2KI.5.27	When he left Elisha, Gehazi had a disease that made his skin as flaky as snow.
2KI.6.1	 The disciples of the prophets said to Elisha, “The place where we’re staying is too small for us. 
2KI.6.2	 Let’s go to the Jordan River. Each of us can get some logs and make a place for us to live there.”
2KI.6.2	Elisha said, “Go ahead.”
2KI.6.3	 Then one of the disciples asked, “Won’t you please come with us?”
2KI.6.3	Elisha answered, “I’ll go.”
2KI.6.4	 So he went with them. They came to the Jordan River and began to cut down trees. 
2KI.6.5	 As one of them was cutting down a tree, the ax head fell into the water. He cried out, “Oh no, master! It was borrowed!”
2KI.6.6	 The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” When he showed Elisha the place, Elisha cut off a piece of wood. He threw it into the water at that place and made the ax head float. 
2KI.6.7	 Elisha said, “Pick it up.” The disciple reached for it and picked it up.
2KI.6.8	 Whenever the king of Aram was fighting against Israel, he asked for advice from his officers about where they were to camp.
2KI.6.9	 So the man of God would send a message to the king of Israel, “Be careful not to go by that place. The Arameans are hiding there.” 
2KI.6.10	 Then the king of Israel would send someone to the place that the man of God told him about. Elisha warned them so that they would be on their guard. He did this repeatedly.
2KI.6.11	 The king of Aram was very angry about this. He called his officers and asked them, “Won’t you tell me who among us is ⌊a spy⌋ for the king of Israel?”
2KI.6.12	 One of his officers answered, “No one, Your Majesty. Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel everything you say—even what you say in your bedroom.”
2KI.6.13	 The king said, “Find out where he is. Then I will send men to capture him.”
2KI.6.13	The king was told, “He is in Dothan.” 
2KI.6.14	 So the king sent horses and chariots and a large fighting unit there. They came at night and surrounded the city.
2KI.6.15	 When the servant of the man of God got up in the morning and went outside, he saw troops, horses, and chariots surrounding the city. Elisha’s servant asked, “Master, what should we do?”
2KI.6.16	 Elisha answered, “Don’t be afraid. We have more forces on our side than they have on theirs.” 
2KI.6.17	 Then Elisha prayed, “L
2KI.6.18	 As the Arameans came down to get him, Elisha prayed to the L
2KI.6.19	 Elisha told them, “This isn’t the way! This isn’t the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you’re looking for.” So he led them into Samaria. 
2KI.6.20	 When they came into Samaria, Elisha said, “L
2KI.6.21	 When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “Master, should I kill them? Should I kill them?”
2KI.6.22	 Elisha answered, “Don’t kill them. Do you kill everyone you take captive in combat? Give them food and water. Let them eat and drink. Then let them go back to their master.”
2KI.6.23	 So the king prepared a great feast for them. They ate and drank, and then he sent them back to their master. After this, Aramean troops didn’t raid Israel’s territory anymore.
2KI.6.24	 Later King Benhadad of Aram assembled his whole army. They went to Samaria and blockaded it. 
2KI.6.25	 The shortages caused by the blockade of Samaria became so severe that a donkey’s head sold for two pounds of silver and a half-pint of dove 
2KI.6.26	 As the king of Israel was walking on the city wall, a woman cried to him, “Help me, Your Majesty!”
2KI.6.27	 He answered, “If the L
2KI.6.28	 Then the king asked her, “What’s the matter?”
2KI.6.28	She answered, “This woman told me, ‘Give up your son. Let’s eat him today. We’ll eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	 So we boiled my son and ate him. The next day I told her, ‘Give up your son. We’ll eat him,’ but she hid her son.”
2KI.6.30	 When the king heard the woman say this, he tore his clothes ⌊in distress⌋. As he was walking on the city wall, the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes. 
2KI.6.31	 He said, “May God strike me dead if the head of Elisha, son of Shaphat, stays on his ⌊body⌋ today.”
2KI.6.32	 Elisha was sitting in his home with the ⌊city’s⌋ leaders. The king had sent one of his men ahead of him ⌊to Elisha’s house⌋. But before the messenger arrived, Elisha asked the leaders, “Do you see how this murderer has sent someone to tear off my head? When the messenger comes, close the door. Hold it shut because the king will be following him.”
2KI.6.33	 While he was still talking to them, the messenger arrived. He said to Elisha, “This severe famine is from the L
2KI.7.1	 Elisha answered, “Listen to the word of the L
2KI.7.2	 The servant on whose arm the king was leaning answered the man of God, “Could this happen even if the L
2KI.7.2	Elisha replied, “You will see it with your own eyes, but you won’t eat any of it.”
2KI.7.3	 Four men with skin diseases were at the entrance of the city gate. One of them asked, “Why are we sitting here waiting to die? 
2KI.7.4	 If we go into the city, the famine is also there, and we’ll still die. But if we stay here, we’ll die. So let’s go to the Aramean camp. If they give us something to keep us alive, we’ll live. But if they kill us, we’ll die anyway.” 
2KI.7.5	 So they started out at dusk to go into the Aramean camp. When they came to the edge of the camp, no one was there.
2KI.7.6	 (The L
2KI.7.7	 So at dusk they fled. They abandoned the camp as it was with its tents, horses, and donkeys and ran for their lives.)
2KI.7.8	 When the men with skin diseases came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried off the silver, gold, and clothes they found in that tent. They went away and hid them. Then they came back, went into another tent, carried off its contents, went away, and hid them.
2KI.7.9	 Then they said to one another, “What we’re doing is not right. This is a day of good news, and we’re not telling anyone about it. If we wait until morning when it’s light out, we’ll be punished. Let’s bring the news to the royal palace.” 
2KI.7.10	 So they called the city gatekeepers and told them, “We went into the Aramean camp, and we didn’t see or hear anyone. The horses and donkeys were still tied up. Even the tents were left exactly as they were.”
2KI.7.11	 The gatekeepers announced the news to the royal palace. 
2KI.7.12	 So the king got up at night and told his officers what the Arameans had planned for them. He said, “They know we’re starving, so they’ve left the camp to hide in the countryside. They’re thinking, ‘When they’ve left the city, we’ll capture them alive and get into the city.’ ”
2KI.7.13	 One of his officers replied, “Please let some men take five of the horses that are left here. Those men will be no worse off than the rest of the Israelites who are dying. Let’s send them to take a look.” 
2KI.7.14	 So they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them to follow the Aramean army and told them to find out what happened. 
2KI.7.15	 They followed them as far as the Jordan River and saw how the whole road was littered with clothes and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their hurry. The messengers returned and told the king about it.
2KI.7.16	 So the people went out and looted the Aramean camp. Then 24 cups of the best flour sold for half an ounce of silver, and 48 cups of barley sold for half an ounce of silver, as the L
2KI.7.17	 The king appointed the servant on whose arm he used to lean to be in charge of the gate. But the people trampled him to death in the gateway, as the man of God had predicted when the king came to him. 
2KI.7.18	 (It happened exactly as the man of God told the king, “48 cups of barley will sell for half an ounce of silver. And 24 cups of the best flour will sell for half an ounce of silver. This will happen about this time tomorrow in the gateway to Samaria.” 
2KI.7.19	 Then the servant answered the man of God, “Could this happen even if the L
2KI.7.20	 So this is what happened to the king’s servant: The people trampled him to death in the gateway.
2KI.8.1	 Elisha had told the woman whose son he had brought back to life, “Go away with your family. Stay wherever you can. The L
2KI.8.2	 The woman did what the man of God told her. She and her family went to live in Philistine territory for seven years. 
2KI.8.3	 At the end of seven years, the woman came home from Philistine territory but left again to make an appeal to the king about her house and land.
2KI.8.4	 The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God. He said, “Please tell me about all the great things Elisha has done.” 
2KI.8.5	 While Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha brought a dead child back to life, the mother ⌊came to⌋ make an appeal to the king about her house and land.
2KI.8.5	Gehazi said, “Your Majesty, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha brought back to life.”
2KI.8.6	 When the king asked the woman ⌊about this⌋, she told him the story. So the king assigned to her an attendant to whom he said, “Restore all that is hers, including whatever her property produced from the day she left the country until now.”
2KI.8.7	 Elisha went to Damascus. King Benhadad of Aram, who was sick, was told, “The man of God has come here.”
2KI.8.8	 The king told Hazael, “Take a present, and meet the man of God. Ask the L
2KI.8.9	 Hazael went to meet Elisha. He took with him a present and all kinds of goods from Damascus. He had loaded the goods on 40 camels. He stood in front of Elisha and said, “Your humble servant King Benhadad of Aram has sent me to you. He asks whether he will recover from this illness.”
2KI.8.10	 Elisha replied, “Tell him that he will get better, although the L
2KI.8.11	 He stared at him until he became embarrassed. Then the man of God began to cry.
2KI.8.12	 “Sir, why are you crying?” Hazael asked.
2KI.8.12	Elisha answered, “I know the evil you will do to the Israelites: You will set their fortresses on fire, kill their best young men, smash their little children, and rip open their pregnant women.”
2KI.8.13	 But Hazael asked, “How can a dog like me do such a significant thing?”
2KI.8.13	Elisha answered, “The L
2KI.8.14	 Hazael left Elisha and went to his master Benhadad, who asked him what Elisha had said.
2KI.8.14	Hazael answered, “He told me that you will get better.”
2KI.8.15	 But the next day Hazael took a blanket, soaked it in water, and smothered the king with it. Hazael ruled as king in his place.
2KI.8.16	 Joram (Ahab’s son) was in his fifth year as king of Israel when Jehoram,
2KI.8.17	 He was 32 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for 8 years in Jerusalem. 
2KI.8.18	 He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as Ahab’s family had done, because his wife was Ahab’s daughter. So he did what the L
2KI.8.19	 But for David’s sake the L
2KI.8.20	 During Jehoram’s time Edom rebelled against Judah and chose its own king. 
2KI.8.21	 Jehoram took all his chariots to attack Zair. The Edomites and their chariot commanders surrounded him, but he got up at night, broke through their lines, and his troops fled home. 
2KI.8.22	 So Edom rebelled against Judah’s rule and is still independent today. At that time Libnah also rebelled. 
2KI.8.23	 Isn’t everything else about Jehoram—everything he did—written in the official records of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.8.24	 Jehoram lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. His son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.
2KI.8.25	 Joram (Ahab’s son) was in his twelfth year as king of Israel when Jehoram’s son Ahaziah became king of Judah. 
2KI.8.26	 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	 Ahaziah followed the ways of Ahab’s family. He did what the L
2KI.8.28	 Ahaziah went with Ahab’s son Joram to fight against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. There the Arameans wounded Joram. 
2KI.8.29	 King Joram returned to Jezreel to let his wounds heal. (He had been wounded by the Arameans at Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Aram.) Then Jehoram’s son Ahaziah went to Jezreel to see Ahab’s son Joram, who was sick.
2KI.9.1	 The prophet Elisha called one of the disciples of the prophets. He said, “Put on your belt. Take this flask of olive oil, and go to Ramoth Gilead. 
2KI.9.2	 When you arrive there, look for Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi. Go inside, and have him get up and leave his companions. Take him into an inner room. 
2KI.9.3	 Take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and say, ‘This is what the L
2KI.9.4	 The young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead. 
2KI.9.5	 When he arrived there, the army’s generals were sitting together. He said, “I have something to tell you, General.”
2KI.9.5	Jehu asked, “Which one of us?”
2KI.9.5	He answered, “You, General!”
2KI.9.6	 Jehu got up and went into the house. The prophet poured olive oil on his head and told him, “This is what the L
2KI.9.7	 You will destroy the family of your master Ahab. I will get revenge on Jezbel for shedding the blood of my servants the prophets and all the L
2KI.9.8	 Ahab’s entire family will die. I will destroy every male 
2KI.9.9	 I will make Ahab’s family like the family of Jer o boam (Nebat’s son) and like the family of Baasha, son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	 Dogs will eat Jezbel inside the walls of Jezreel, and no one will bury her.” Then he opened the door and left.
2KI.9.11	 Jehu came out to his master’s officials. One of them asked him, “Is everything alright? Why did this lunatic come to you?”
2KI.9.11	He answered, “You know the man and the kind of things he says.”

2KI.9.12	Jehu replied, “We talked for a while, and he said to me, ‘This is what the L
2KI.9.13	 Then each one of them immediately took off his coat and laid it on the stairs below him. They blew a ram’s horn and said, “Jehu is king!”
2KI.9.14	 So Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi, plotted against Joram. (Joram and all Israel were guarding Ramoth Gilead against King Hazael of Aram. 
2KI.9.15	 But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received while fighting King Hazael of Aram.)
2KI.9.15	Then Jehu said, “If you want me to be king, don’t let anyone escape from the city to take the news to Jezreel.” 
2KI.9.16	 So Jehu got on his chariot and drove to Jezreel because Joram was lying in bed there. (King Ahaziah of Judah had come to see Joram.)
2KI.9.17	 The watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s troops coming. He said, “I see some troops.”
2KI.9.17	So Joram said, “Take a chariot driver, send him to meet them, and ask, ‘Is everything alright?’ ”
2KI.9.18	 So a chariot driver rode off, met Jehu, and said, “The king asks, ‘Is everything alright?’”
2KI.9.18	Jehu replied, “Why should that matter to you? Follow me.”
2KI.9.18	So the watchman announced, “The messenger you sent has reached them, but he isn’t coming back.”
2KI.9.19	 Then Joram sent out a second driver. When he came to them, he said, “The king asks, ‘Is everything alright?’”
2KI.9.19	Jehu replied, “Why should that matter to you? Follow me.”
2KI.9.20	 So the watchman announced, “He has reached them, but he isn’t coming back. The troop’s leader is driving like a lunatic, like Jehu, grandson of Nimshi.”
2KI.9.21	 “Hitch the horses to the chariot,” Joram ordered. When that was done, King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah went to meet Jehu, each in his own chariot. They found him in the field that belonged to Naboth from Jezreel.
2KI.9.22	 When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Is everything alright, Jehu?”
2KI.9.22	Jehu answered, “How can everything be alright as long as your mother continues her idolatry and witchcraft?”
2KI.9.23	 As Joram turned his chariot around and tried to flee, he said to Ahaziah, “It’s a trap, Ahaziah!” 
2KI.9.24	 But Jehu took his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow came out of his chest, and he slumped over in his chariot.
2KI.9.25	 Then Jehu said to his attendant Bidkar, “Take him away, and throw him into the field that belonged to Naboth from Jezreel. Remember when you and I were driving our chariots behind his father Ahab? The L
2KI.9.26	 ‘Just as I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday, I will pay you back in this field,’ declares the L
2KI.9.27	 When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled on the road leading to Beth Haggan. Jehu pursued him and ordered, “Shoot him down in his chariot.” They shot him at Gur Pass, which is near Ibleam. Ahaziah continued to flee until he got to Megiddo, where he died. 
2KI.9.28	 His servants brought him in a chariot to Jerusalem. They buried him in a tomb with his ancestors in the City of David. 
2KI.9.29	 (Ahaziah had become king of Judah in the eleventh year that Joram, Ahab’s son, was king of Israel.)
2KI.9.30	 When Jehu arrived in Jezreel, Jezbel heard about it. She put on eye shadow, fixed her hair, and looked out of a second-story window. 
2KI.9.31	 When Jehu entered the gateway, she asked, “Is everything alright, Zimri, murderer of your master?”
2KI.9.32	 Looking up at the window, he asked, “Is anyone on my side? Anyone?” Then two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
2KI.9.33	 He said, “Throw her down.” They threw her down, and some of her blood splattered on the wall and the horses. The horses trampled her.
2KI.9.34	 He went inside, ate, and drank. Then he said, “Take care of this woman who had a curse on her. After all, she was a king’s daughter.” 
2KI.9.35	 But when they went out to bury her, they couldn’t find any of her body except her skull, feet, and hands. 
2KI.9.36	 They came back and told him.
2KI.9.36	Jehu said, “The L
2KI.9.37	 Jezbel’s corpse will be like manure on the ground in the fields surrounding Jezreel so that no one will be able to say that this is Jezbel.’ ”
2KI.10.1	 Ahab had 70 male heirs in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters to the officials of Jezreel, the respected leaders, and the guardians of Ahab’s descendants in Samaria. The letters read, 
2KI.10.2	 “Your master’s heirs are with you, and you have chariots, horses, fortified cities, and weapons. As soon as this letter reaches you, 
2KI.10.3	 choose the best and most honest of your master’s heirs, and put him on Ahab’s throne. Fight for your master’s family.”
2KI.10.4	 But they panicked. They said, “If two kings couldn’t stand up to him, how can we stand up to him?” 
2KI.10.5	 So the official in charge of the palace, the mayor of the city, the respected leaders, and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: “We are your servants. We’ll do everything you tell us. We won’t make anyone king. Do what you think is best.”
2KI.10.6	 So he wrote them a second letter. It read, “If you are on my side and ready to listen to me, bring the heads of your master’s heirs to me in Jezreel about this time tomorrow.”
2KI.10.6	The 70 male heirs were staying with the city’s most powerful men. These men had raised them. 
2KI.10.7	 When the letter came to the men, they slaughtered all 70 heirs. They put the heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	 A messenger told him, “They’ve brought the heads of the king’s heirs.”
2KI.10.8	Jehu said, “Put them in two piles at the entrance to the gateway until morning.” 
2KI.10.9	 In the morning he stood there. He told the people, “You are innocent. I plotted against my master and killed him. But who killed all these men? 
2KI.10.10	 You can be sure that the word of the L
2KI.10.11	 Jehu also killed every member of Ahab’s household who was left in Jezreel: all the most powerful men, friends, and priests. Not one of them was left.
2KI.10.12	 Then Jehu left for Samaria. When he came to Beth Eked of the Shepherds, 
2KI.10.13	 he found some relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah. “Who are you?” he asked.
2KI.10.13	They answered, “We’re Ahaziah’s relatives. We’ve come to greet the families of the king and the queen mother.”
2KI.10.14	 Jehu ordered, “Capture them!”
2KI.10.14	⌊Jehu’s men⌋ captured and slaughtered 42 of them at a cistern near Beth Eked. They didn’t leave any survivors.
2KI.10.15	 When he left that place, he met Jehonadab, son of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and asked, “Are you as loyal to me as I am to you?”
2KI.10.15	“I am,” Jehonadab answered.
2KI.10.15	⌊So Jehu said,⌋ “If you are, give me your hand.”
2KI.10.15	When he gave Jehu his hand, Jehu helped him up into the chariot. 
2KI.10.16	 Jehu said, “Come with me. See how devoted I am to the L
2KI.10.17	 When they arrived in Samaria, Jehu killed the rest of Ahab’s family, every member who was left in Samaria. He wiped them out, as the L
2KI.10.18	 Then Jehu brought all the people together. He said, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him a lot. 
2KI.10.19	 Summon all the prophets, servants, and priests of Baal. Make sure no one is missing because I have a great sacrifice to offer Baal. Whoever is missing will not live.” (Jehu was deceiving ⌊them⌋. He actually wanted to destroy those who worshiped Baal.)
2KI.10.20	 Jehu said, “Call a holy assembly to honor Baal.” So they did. 
2KI.10.21	 Jehu sent messengers to all the Israelites. All the worshipers of Baal came, and there wasn’t one who didn’t come. They went into the temple of Baal and filled it from one end to the other.
2KI.10.22	 Then Jehu told the man in charge of the priests’ robes, “Bring out the robes for all the worshipers of Baal.” So he brought out robes for them. 
2KI.10.23	 Jehu and Jehonadab, son of Rechab, went into the temple of Baal and said to the worshipers of Baal, “Make sure that there are no worshipers of the L
2KI.10.24	 So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. But Jehu had stationed 80 of his men outside. He said ⌊to them⌋, “If any of the people I’m putting in your hands escape, you will pay for their lives with yours.”
2KI.10.25	 When the burnt offerings had been made, Jehu said to the guards and attendants, “Kill them. Don’t let anyone get away.” So they used swords to kill the Baal worshipers and threw out the bodies until the guards and attendants came to the stronghold in the temple of Baal. 
2KI.10.26	 Then they brought out the large sacred stone of the temple of Baal and burned it. 
2KI.10.27	 They destroyed the sacred stone of Baal and the temple of Baal and made it into a latrine. It is still a latrine today.
2KI.10.28	 So Jehu got rid of Baal worship throughout Israel. 
2KI.10.29	 But Jehu did not turn away from the sins that Jer o boam (Nebat’s son) led Israel to commit—⌊the worship of⌋ the golden calves that were at Bethel and Dan.

2KI.10.34	 Isn’t everything else about Jehu—everything he did, all his heroic acts—written in the official records of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.10.35	 Jehu lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz succeeded him as king. 
2KI.10.36	 Jehu ruled as king of Israel in Samaria for 28 years.
2KI.11.1	 When Ahaziah’s mother, Athaliah, saw that her son was dead, she began to destroy the entire royal family. 
2KI.11.2	 But Jehosheba, daughter of King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, took Ahaziah’s son Joash. She saved him from being killed with the king’s other sons, and in a bedroom she hid him and his nurse from Athaliah. So Joash wasn’t killed 
2KI.11.3	 but was hidden with her in the L
2KI.11.4	 In the seventh year of Athaliah’s reign, Jehoiada sent for the company commanders of the Carites and the guards and had them come to him in the L
2KI.11.5	 He ordered them, “This is what you must do: One third of you, those who are on duty on the day of worship, must guard the royal palace. 
2KI.11.6	 Another third must be at Sur Gate. And another third must be at the gate behind the guards. You will guard the king’s residence.
2KI.11.7	 Then your two groups who ⌊normally⌋ go off duty on the day of worship must guard the king at the L
2KI.11.8	 Surround the king. Each man should have his weapons in his hand. Kill anyone who tries to break through your ranks. Stay with the king wherever he goes.”
2KI.11.9	 The company commanders did as the priest Jehoiada had ordered them. Each commander took his men who were coming on duty on the day of worship as well as those who were about to go off duty and came to the priest Jehoiada. 
2KI.11.10	 He gave the commanders the spears and the shields that had belonged to King David but were now in the L
2KI.11.11	 The guards stood with their weapons in their hands. They were stationed around the king and around the altar and the temple (from the south side to the north side of the temple). 
2KI.11.12	 Then Jehoiada brought out the king’s son, gave him the crown and the religious instructions, and made him king by anointing him. As the guards clapped their hands, they said, “Long live the king!”
2KI.11.13	 When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the other people, she went into the L
2KI.11.14	 She looked, and the king was standing by the pillar according to custom. The commanders and the trumpeters were by his side. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. As Athaliah tore her clothes ⌊in distress⌋, she cried, “Treason, treason!”
2KI.11.15	 Then the priest Jehoiada ordered the company commanders who were in charge of the army, “Take her out of the temple. Use your sword to kill anyone who follows her.” (The priest had said, “She must not be killed in the L

2KI.11.18	 Then all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed Baal’s altars and his statues and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.

2KI.11.20	 All the people of the land were celebrating. But the city was quiet because they had killed Athaliah with a sword at the royal palace.
2KI.11.21	 Joash 
2KI.12.1	 Joash began to rule in Jehu’s seventh year as king of Israel, and he ruled for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 
2KI.12.2	 Joash did what the L
2KI.12.3	 But the illegal places of worship weren’t torn down. The people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense at these worship sites.
2KI.12.4	 Joash told the priests, “⌊Collect⌋ all the holy contributions that are brought into the L
2KI.12.5	 Each of the priests should receive it from the donors and use it to make repairs on the temple where they are needed.”
2KI.12.6	 But by Joash’s twenty-third year as king, the priests still had not repaired the temple. 
2KI.12.7	 So King Joash called for Jehoiada and the other priests and asked them, “Why aren’t you repairing the damage in the temple? Don’t take any more money from the donors ⌊for your own use⌋. Instead, use it to make repairs on the temple.” 
2KI.12.8	 The priests agreed neither to receive money from the people ⌊for personal use⌋ nor to be responsible for repairing the temple.
2KI.12.9	 Then the priest Jehoiada took a box, drilled a hole in its lid, and put it at the right side of the altar as one comes into the L
2KI.12.10	 Whenever they saw a lot of money in the box, the king’s scribe and the chief priest would collect and count the money that was donated in the L

2KI.12.13	 But no silver bowls, snuffers, dishes, trumpets, or any other gold and silver utensils were made for the L
2KI.12.14	 Instead, the money was given to the workmen, and they used it to repair the temple. 
2KI.12.15	 They didn’t require the men who were entrusted with the money for the workers to give an account, because they were honest people. 
2KI.12.16	 The money from the guilt offerings and the offerings for sin was not brought into the L
2KI.12.17	 At this time King Hazael of Aram fought against Gath and conquered it. He was also determined to attack Jerusalem.

2KI.12.19	 Isn’t everything else about Joash—everything he did—written in the official records of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.12.20	 His own officials plotted against him and killed him at Beth Millo on the road that goes down to Silla. 
2KI.12.21	 Joash’s officials Jozacar, son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of Shomer, executed him. They buried him with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Amaziah succeeded him as king.
2KI.13.1	 Ahaziah’s son King Joash of Judah was in his twenty-third year as king of Judah when Jehoahaz,

2KI.13.7	 Jehoahaz had no army left except for 50 horses, 10 chariots, and 10,000 foot soldiers because the king of Aram had destroyed the rest. He had made them like dust that people trample. 
2KI.13.8	 Isn’t everything else about Jehoahaz—everything he did, his heroic acts—written in the official records of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.9	 Jehoahaz lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoash 
2KI.13.10	 In Joash’s thirty-seventh year as king of Judah, Jehoahaz’s son Jehoash began to rule Israel in Samaria. He ruled for 16 years.

2KI.13.13	 Jehoash lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried with the kings of Israel in Samaria. Then Jer o boam claimed the throne.
2KI.13.14	 Elisha became fatally ill. King Jehoash of Israel visited him, cried over him, and said, “Master! Master! Israel’s chariot and horses!”
2KI.13.15	 Elisha told him, “Get a bow and some arrows.” So he got a bow and some arrows. 
2KI.13.16	 Then Elisha told the king of Israel, “Take the bow in your hand.” So the king picked up the bow. Elisha laid his hands on the king’s hands. 
2KI.13.17	 Elisha said, “Open the window that faces east.” So the king opened it. “Shoot,” Elisha said, and the king shot. Then Elisha said, “That is the arrow of the L
2KI.13.18	 Then Elisha said, “Take the arrows.” So the king took them. “Stomp on them,” he told the king of Israel. The king stomped three times and stopped.
2KI.13.19	 Then the man of God became angry with him. “You should have stomped five or six times!” he said. “Then you would have completely defeated the Arameans. But now you will only defeat the Arameans three times.”
2KI.13.20	 Elisha died and was buried. Moabite raiding parties used to invade the country in the spring. 
2KI.13.21	 One day some people who were burying a man saw one of these raiding parties. So they quickly put the man into Elisha’s tomb. But when the body touched Elisha’s bones, the man came back to life and stood up.
2KI.13.22	 King Hazael of Aram oppressed Israel as long as Jehoahaz ruled. 
2KI.13.23	 But the L
2KI.13.24	 King Hazael of Aram died, and his son Benhadad succeeded him as king. 
2KI.13.25	 Then Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, reconquered the cities that Benhadad had taken from his father Jehoahaz. Jehoash defeated Benhadad three times and recovered those cities of Israel.
2KI.14.1	 Jehoahaz’s son King Jehoash was in his second year as king of Israel when King Amaziah, son of Joash of Judah, began to rule. 
2KI.14.2	 Amaziah was 25 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem.

2KI.14.6	 But he didn’t execute their children. He obeyed the L
2KI.14.7	 Amaziah killed 10,000 Edomites in the Dead Sea region and took the city of Sela in battle. He gave it the name Joktheel, which is still its name today.
2KI.14.8	 Then Amaziah sent messengers to King Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu of Israel, to declare war on Israel.
2KI.14.9	 King Jehoash of Israel sent this message to King Amaziah of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon. It said, ‘Let your daughter marry my son,’ but a wild animal from Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle. 
2KI.14.10	 You certainly defeated Edom, and now you have become arrogant. Enjoy your fame, but stay home. Why must you invite disaster and your own defeat and take Judah with you?”
2KI.14.11	 But Amaziah wouldn’t listen. So King Jehoash of Israel attacked, and King Amaziah of Judah met him in battle at Beth Shemesh in Judah. 
2KI.14.12	 Israel defeated the army of Judah, and the Judeans fled to their homes. 
2KI.14.13	 King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah, son of Joash and grandson of Ahaziah of Judah, at Beth Shemesh and went to Jerusalem. He tore down a 600-foot section of the wall around Jerusalem from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate.

2KI.14.18	 Isn’t everything else about Amaziah written in the official records of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.14.19	 Conspirators in Jerusalem plotted against him, so he fled to Lachish. But they sent men to Lachish after him and killed him there.

2KI.14.21	 All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was 16 years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.

2KI.15.30	 Hoshea, son of Elah, plotted against Pekah, son of Remaliah. Hoshea attacked him and killed him. Hoshea began to rule as king in his place in the twentieth year that Azariah, son of Jotham, was king of Judah. 
2KI.15.31	 Everything else about Pekah—everything he did—is written in the official records of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.32	 In the second year that King Pekah, son of Remaliah, ruled Israel, Jotham, son of Azariah, began to rule as king of Judah. 
2KI.15.33	 He was 25 years old when he began to rule. He ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jerusha, daughter of Zadok. 
2KI.15.34	 He did what the L

2KI.16.1	 Pekah, son of Remaliah, was in his seventeenth year as king of Israel when King Ahaz, son of Jotham, began to rule as king of Judah. 
2KI.16.2	 Ahaz was 20 years old when he began to rule. He ruled for 26 years in Jerusalem. He didn’t do what the L
2KI.16.3	 He followed the example of the kings of Israel and even sacrificed his son by burning him alive. Sacrificing ⌊children⌋ was one of the disgusting things done by the nations that the L

2KI.16.5	 Then King Rezin of Aram and King Pekah, son of Remaliah of Israel, came to wage war against Jerusalem. They blockaded Ahaz but couldn’t get him to fight. 
2KI.16.6	 At that time King Rezin of Aram drove the Judeans out of Elath and gave it back to Edom.
2KI.16.7	 Ahaz sent messengers to King Tiglath Pileser of Assyria to say, “I’m your servant, your son. Come and save me from the kings of Aram and Israel who are attacking me.” 
2KI.16.8	 Ahaz took the silver and gold he found in the L
2KI.16.9	 The king of Assyria listened to him and attacked Damascus. He captured it, took the people to Kir as captives, and killed Rezin.
2KI.16.10	 Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet King Tiglath Pileser of Assyria. He saw an altar there in Damascus. So King Ahaz sent the priest Urijah a model of the altar and a set of detailed plans. 
2KI.16.11	 Urijah built an altar exactly like the model King Ahaz sent from Damascus. He finished it before Ahaz returned home from Damascus.
2KI.16.12	 When the king came from Damascus, he saw the altar. The king approached the altar and went up to it. 
2KI.16.13	 He sacrificed his burnt offering and grain offering, poured out his wine offering, and sprinkled the blood of his fellowship offering on the altar. 
2KI.16.14	 But he moved the bronze altar dedicated to the L
2KI.16.15	 King Ahaz gave this command to the priest Urijah: “On this great altar you must burn the morning burnt offerings and the evening grain offering, the king’s burnt offerings and grain offerings, and the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and wine offerings of all the people of the land. Sprinkle all the blood of the burnt offerings and ⌊other⌋ sacrifices on it. I will use the bronze altar for prayer.” 
2KI.16.16	 The priest Urijah did what King Ahaz had commanded.
2KI.16.17	 King Ahaz cut off the side panels of the ⌊bronze⌋ stands ⌊used in the temple⌋ and removed the basin from each of them. He took the bronze pool down from the bronze bulls that were under it and set it on a stone base. 
2KI.16.18	 Ahaz removed the covered walkway used on the day of worship. This walkway had been built in the temple. He also removed the outer entrance for the king from the L

2KI.16.20	 Ahaz lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. His son Hezekiah succeeded him as king.

2KI.17.2	 He did what the L
2KI.17.3	 King Shalmaneser of Assyria defeated Hoshea, who became his servant and was required to make annual payments to him. 
2KI.17.4	 The king of Assyria found Hoshea to be a traitor. (Hoshea had sent messengers to King Dais of Egypt and had stopped making annual payments to the king of Assyria.) So the king of Assyria arrested him and put him in prison. 
2KI.17.5	 Then the king of Assyria attacked the entire country. He attacked Samaria and blockaded it for three years. 
2KI.17.6	 In Hoshea’s ninth year as king of Israel, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and took the Israelites to Assyria as captives. He settled them in Halah, along the Habor River in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

2KI.17.16	They prayed to the entire army of heaven.
2KI.17.16	They worshiped Baal.
2KI.17.17	 They sacrificed their sons and daughters by burning them alive.

2KI.17.24	 The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the Israelites. They took over Samaria and lived in its cities.

2KI.17.26	 Then someone said to the king of Assyria, “The people you took as captives and settled in the cities of Samaria don’t know the customs of the god of that country, so he sent lions. Now the lions are killing them because they don’t know the customs of the god of this country.”
2KI.17.27	 The king of Assyria gave this command: “Bring one of the priests you captured from there. Let him go back to teach them the customs of the god of that country.” 
2KI.17.28	 So one of the priests who had been taken prisoner from Samaria went to live in Bethel. He taught them how to worship the L
2KI.17.29	 But each group ⌊that settled in Samaria⌋ continued to make its own gods. They put them at the illegal places of worship, which the people of Samaria had made. Each group did this in the cities where they lived:

2KI.17.30	The people from Cuth made Nergal.
2KI.17.30	The people from Hamath made Ashima.

2KI.18.3	 He did what the L
2KI.18.4	 He got rid of the illegal places of worship, crushed the sacred stones, and cut down the poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah. He even crushed the bronze snake that Moses had made because up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. They called it Nehushtan.

2KI.18.10	 and captured it at the end of three years. Samaria was taken in Hezekiah’s sixth year as king (which was Hoshea’s ninth year as king of Israel). 
2KI.18.11	 The king of Assyria took the Israelites to Assyria as captives. He put them in Halah, along the Habor River in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

2KI.18.14	So the king of Assyria demanded that King Hezekiah of Judah pay 22,500 pounds of silver and 2,250 pounds of gold.

2KI.18.17	 Then the king of Assyria sent his commander-in-chief, his quartermaster, and his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They came there and stood at the channel for the Upper Pool on the road to the Laundryman’s Field. 
2KI.18.18	 When they called for King Hezekiah, Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace and was the son of Hilkiah, Shebnah the scribe, and Joah, who was the royal historian and the son of Asaph, went out to the field commander.
2KI.18.19	 The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What makes you so confident? 
2KI.18.20	 You give useless advice about getting ready for war. Whom, then, do you trust for support in your rebellion against me? 
2KI.18.21	 Now, look! When you trust Egypt, you’re trusting a broken stick for a staff. If you lean on it, it stabs your hand and goes through it. This is what Pharaoh (the king of Egypt) is like for everyone who trusts him.

2KI.18.27	 But the field commander asked them, “Did my master send me to tell these things only to you and your master? Didn’t he send me to the men sitting on the wall who will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine with you?”
2KI.18.28	 Then the field commander stood and shouted loudly in the Judean language, “Listen to the great king, the king of Assyria.

2KI.19.1	 When King Hezekiah heard the message, he tore his clothes in grief, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the L
2KI.19.2	 Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and the leaders of the priests, clothed in sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz.
2KI.19.3	 They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day filled with misery, punishment, and disgrace. We are like a woman who is about to give birth but doesn’t have the strength to do it.

2KI.19.8	 The field commander returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah. He had heard that the king left Lachish. 
2KI.19.9	 Now, Sennacherib heard that King Tirhakah of Sudan was coming to fight him.
2KI.19.9	Sennacherib sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
2KI.19.10	 “Tell King Hezekiah of Judah, ‘Don’t let the god whom you trust deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be put under the control of the king of Assyria. 
2KI.19.11	 You heard what the kings of Assyria did to all countries, how they totally destroyed them. Will you be rescued? 
2KI.19.12	 Did the gods of the nations which my ancestors destroyed rescue Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? 
2KI.19.13	 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the cities of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’ ”
2KI.19.14	 Hezekiah took the letters from the messengers, read them, and went to the L

2KI.22.11	 When the king heard what the book of the Teachings said, he tore his clothes ⌊in distress⌋. 
2KI.22.12	 Then the king gave an order to the priest Hilkiah, to Ahikam (son of Shaphan), Achbor (son of Micaiah), the scribe Shaphan, and the royal official Asaiah. He said,

2KI.23.14	 Josiah crushed the sacred stones, cut down the poles dedicated to Asherah, and filled their places with human bones. 
2KI.23.15	 He also tore down the altar at Bethel—the place of worship made by Jer o boam (Nebat’s son), who had made Israel sin. He tore down both the altar and the place of worship. They burned the worship site, crushing it to powder and burning the pole dedicated to Asherah.

2KI.23.35	 Jehoiakim gave Pharaoh the silver and the gold. But he had to tax the country to pay the silver Pharaoh had demanded. He taxed each person according to his wealth so that he could get the silver and gold from the people of the land and give it to Pharaoh Necoh.

2KI.25.2	 The blockade of the city lasted until Zedekiah’s eleventh year as king. 
2KI.25.3	 On the ninth day of the fourth 
2KI.25.4	 The enemy broke through the city walls that night. All Judah’s soldiers left on the road of the gate between the two walls beside the king’s garden. While the Babylonians were attacking the city from all sides, the king took the road to the plain ⌊of Jericho⌋. 
2KI.25.5	 The Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and caught up with him in the plain of Jericho. His entire army had deserted him. 
2KI.25.6	 The Babylonians captured the king, brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and passed sentence on him. 
2KI.25.7	 They slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons as he watched, and then they blinded Zedekiah. They put him in bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.

2KI.25.19	 From the city he also took an army commander, 5 men who had access to the king whom he found in the city, the scribe who was in charge of the militia, and 60 of the common people whom he found in the city. 
2KI.25.20	 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	 The king of Babylon executed them at Riblah in the territory of Hamath. So the people of Judah were captives when they left their land.
2KI.25.22	 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon appointed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to govern the remaining people in the land of Judah. 
2KI.25.23	 When all the army commanders and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They were Ishmael (son of Nethaniah), Johanan (son of Kareah), Seraiah (son of Tanhumeth from Netophah), and Jaazaniah from Beth Maacah and their men. 
2KI.25.24	 Gedaliah swore an oath to them and their men. He said, “Don’t be afraid of the Babylonian officers. Live in this country, serve the king of Babylon, and you will prosper.”
2KI.25.25	 In the seventh month Ishmael (son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama, a descendant of the kings) went with ten men to kill Gedaliah and the Judeans and Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah. 
2KI.25.26	 Then people of all classes and the army commanders left for Egypt because they were afraid of the Babylonians.
2KI.25.27	 On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the imprisonment of King Jehoiakin of Judah, King Evil Merodach of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, freed King Jehoiakin of Judah from prison.

1CH.5.20	 and received help while fighting them. Hagar’s descendants and the nations with them were handed over to Reuben’s descendants. They had called out to God during the battle, and he answered their prayers because they trusted him. 
1CH.5.21	 They confiscated the Hagrites’ livestock: 50,000 of their camels, 250,000 sheep and goats, and 2,000 donkeys. They captured 100,000 people.

1CH.5.25	 But Gad, Reuben, and half of the tribe of Manasseh were unfaithful to the God of their ancestors. They chased after the gods of the people of the land as if they were prostitutes. God had destroyed these people as the Israelites arrived. 
1CH.5.26	 Then the God of Israel led King Pul of Assyria (King Tiglath Pilneser of Assyria) to take Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh into captivity. He brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the Gozan River. They are still there today.

1CH.10.4	 Saul told his armorbearer, “Draw your sword! Stab me, or these godless men will come and make fun of me.” But his armorbearer refused because he was terrified. So Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
1CH.10.5	 When the armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on the sword and died. 
1CH.10.6	 So Saul, his three sons, and his dynasty died together.
1CH.10.7	 When all the people of Israel in the valley saw that ⌊their army⌋ had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities. So the Philistines came to live in these cities.

1CH.10.13	 So Saul died because of his unfaithfulness to the L
1CH.10.14	 He didn’t request information from the L
1CH.11.1	 All Israel gathered around David at Hebron. “We are your own flesh and blood,” they said. 
1CH.11.2	 “Even in the past when Saul ruled, you were the one who led Israel on its campaigns to war. The L
1CH.11.3	 All the leaders of Israel had come to Hebron. David made an agreement with them at Hebron in front of the L
1CH.11.4	 David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites were living in that region. 
1CH.11.5	 They told David, “You will never get in here.” But David captured the fortress Zion (that is, the City of David).
1CH.11.6	 Now, David said, “Whoever is the first to kill a Jebusite will be made a general and a prince.” Zeruiah’s son Joab was the first to go ⌊into Jerusalem⌋, so he became the general.
1CH.11.7	 David lived in the fortress, so it was called the City of David. 
1CH.11.8	 He built the city ⌊of Jerusalem⌋ around it, starting from the Millo

1CH.11.13	 Eleazar was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. There was a field of ripe barley. When the troops fled from the Philistines, 
1CH.11.14	 they stood in the middle of the field and defended it by killing Philistines. So the L
1CH.11.15	 Once three of the thirty leading men went down to David’s rock at the cave of Adullam when the army of the Philistines was camping in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.11.16	 While David was in the fortified camp, Philistine troops were in Bethlehem.
1CH.11.17	 David was thirsty and said, “I wish I could have a drink of water from the cistern at the city gate of Bethlehem.” 
1CH.11.18	 So the three burst into the Philistine camp and drew water from the cistern. They brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. He poured it out ⌊as an offering⌋ to the L
1CH.11.19	 and said, “It’s unthinkable that I would do this, God. Should I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives? They had to risk their lives to get this water.” So he refused to drink it.
1CH.11.19	These are the things which the three fighting men did.
1CH.11.20	 Joab’s brother Abishai was the leader of the thirty. He used his spear to kill 300 men, but he was not one of the three, 
1CH.11.21	 although he was honored more than they were. So he became their captain but didn’t become a member of the three.
1CH.11.22	 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was from Kabzeel and was a brave man who did many things. He killed two distinguished soldiers from Moab. He also went into a cistern and killed a lion on the day it snowed.

1CH.11.24	 These are the things that Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, did. He was as famous as the three fighting men. 
1CH.11.25	 He was honored more than the thirty, but he was not a member of the three. David put him in charge of his bodyguards.
1CH.11.26	 The distinguished fighting men were

1CH.12.2	 They were armed with bows and could sling stones or shoot arrows with either their right or their left hands. They were Saul’s relatives, ⌊from the tribe of⌋ Benjamin. 
1CH.12.3	 Ahiezer was the leader, then Joash (they were the sons of Shemaah from Gibeah), Azmaveth’s sons Jeziel and Pelet, Beracah and Jehu from Anathoth, 
1CH.12.4	 Ishmaiah from Gibeon (one of the thirty fighting men and one of their leaders),
1CH.12.5	 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah from Haruph, 
1CH.12.6	 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam (Korah’s descendants), 
1CH.12.7	 and Joelah and Zebadiah, Jeroham’s sons from Gedor.
1CH.12.8	 Some men left Gad to join David at the fortified camp in the desert. They were warriors, trained soldiers, able to fight with shields and spears. They looked like lions and were as fast as gazelles on the hills. 
1CH.12.9	 Ezer was the first of these soldiers. The second was Obadiah. The third was Eliab. 
1CH.12.10	 The fourth was Mishmannah. The fifth was Jeremiah.

1CH.12.15	 In the first month of the year, these men crossed the Jordan River when it was flooding its banks. They chased away all the people in the valleys to the east and west.
1CH.12.16	 Some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to David at the fortified camp. 
1CH.12.17	 David went to meet them. He told them, “If you’ve come to help me as friends would, then you may join me. But if you’ve come to betray me to my enemies, even though I haven’t committed a crime, may the God of our ancestors see this and judge you.”
1CH.12.18	 Then the Spirit gave Amasai, the leader of the thirty, the strength ⌊to say⌋,
1CH.12.18	“We are yours, David.
1CH.12.18	We are with you, son of Jesse.
1CH.12.18	Success, success to you!
1CH.12.18	Success to those who help you,
1CH.12.18	because your God is helping you.”
1CH.12.18	So David welcomed them and made them officers over his troops.
1CH.12.19	 Some men from Manasseh had deserted ⌊Saul’s army⌋ to join David when he went with the Philistines to attack Saul. (However, David didn’t help the Philistines because their rulers sent him away after considering the matter. They said, “It will cost us our heads when he deserts and joins his master Saul.”) 
1CH.12.20	 When David went to Ziklag, these men from Manasseh deserted to join him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. Each one was an officer over 1,000 men in Manasseh. 
1CH.12.21	 They helped David fight raiding parties because they were all warriors, commanders in the army. 
1CH.12.22	 From day to day, men came to help David until he had an army as large as God’s army.
1CH.12.23	 These are the numbers of the men equipped for war. The men joined David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingship over to David, as the L

1CH.12.37	 From the east side of the Jordan River, from Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, there were 120,000 soldiers ready to fight with all kinds of weapons.
1CH.12.38	 All of these soldiers, who were prepared for battle, came with a single purpose to Hebron—to make David king of all Israel. The rest of Israel also had agreed to make David king. 
1CH.12.39	 They ate and drank with David for three days because their relatives ⌊in Judah⌋ had provided enough for them. 
1CH.12.40	 Also, their neighbors as far as the territories of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. There was plenty of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle, and sheep, because Israel was celebrating.
1CH.13.1	 David consulted with every officer who commanded a regiment or battalion. 
1CH.13.2	 Then he told the whole assembly of Israel, “If you approve and if the L
1CH.13.3	 Then we’ll bring back our God’s ark, which we ignored while Saul was king.”
1CH.13.4	 The whole assembly agreed to this because the people considered it the right thing to do. 
1CH.13.5	 So David gathered all Israel from the Shihor River near Egypt to the border of Hamath in order to bring God’s ark from Kiriath Jearim.
1CH.13.6	 David and all Israel went to Baalah in Kiriath Jearim, which is in Judah, to bring God’s ark ⌊to Jerusalem⌋. (The L
1CH.13.7	 David and his men put God’s ark on a new cart from Abinadab’s home. Uzzah and Ahio guided the cart. 
1CH.13.8	 David and all Israel were celebrating in God’s presence with all their might, with songs, with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
1CH.13.9	 But when they came to Chidon’s threshing floor,
1CH.13.10	 The L
1CH.13.11	 David was angry because the L
1CH.13.12	 David was afraid of God that day. “How can I bring God’s ark to my ⌊city⌋?” he asked. 
1CH.13.13	 So he didn’t bring God’s ark to his ⌊home⌋, the City of David. Instead, he rerouted it to the home of Obed Edom, who was from Gath. 
1CH.13.14	 God’s ark stayed at the home of Obed Edom with his family for three months, and the L
1CH.14.1	 King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedarwood, masons, and carpenters to build a palace for David. 
1CH.14.2	 So David realized that the L
1CH.14.3	 David married more wives in Jerusalem and fathered more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	 These are the names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
1CH.14.5	 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.8	 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of Israel, all of them came to attack David. But David heard about it and went out to meet them. 
1CH.14.9	 The Philistines had come and raided the valley of Rephaim.
1CH.14.10	 David asked God, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?”
1CH.14.10	The L
1CH.14.11	 So David ⌊and his men⌋ attacked and defeated the Philistines at Baal Perazim. David said, “Using my power like an overwhelming flood, God has overwhelmed my enemies.” That is why they call that place Baal Perazim [The Lord Overwhelms]. 
1CH.14.12	 The Philistines left their gods there, so David ordered that the gods be burned.
1CH.14.13	 The Philistines again raided the valley. 
1CH.14.14	 Once more David asked God.
1CH.14.14	God answered him, “Don’t go after them. Circle around, and come at them in front of the balsam trees. 
1CH.14.15	 As you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out and fight because God has gone ahead of you to defeat the Philistine army.”
1CH.14.16	 David did as God ordered him, and his men defeated the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	 David’s fame spread through all lands, and the L
1CH.15.1	 After David constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, he prepared a place for God’s ark and set up a tent for it. 
1CH.15.2	 Then David insisted that only the Levites carry God’s ark because the L
1CH.15.3	 David called together all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the L
1CH.15.4	 David also called together Aaron’s descendants and the Levites. 
1CH.15.5	 Leading Kohath’s descendants was Uriel, who came with 120 of his relatives. 
1CH.15.6	 Leading Merari’s descendants was Asaiah, who came with 220 of his relatives. 
1CH.15.7	 Leading Gershom’s descendants was Joel, who came with 130 of his relatives. 
1CH.15.8	 Leading Elizaphan’s descendants was Shemaiah, who came with 200 of his relatives. 
1CH.15.9	 Leading Hebron’s descendants was Eliel, who came with 80 of his relatives. 
1CH.15.10	 Leading Uzziel’s descendants was Amminadab, who came with 112 of his relatives.
1CH.15.11	 David called for the priests Zadok and Abiathar and for the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 
1CH.15.12	 He said to them, “You are the heads of the Levite families. You and your relatives must perform the ceremonies to make yourselves holy. Then bring the ark of the L
1CH.15.13	 Because you weren’t there the first time, the L
1CH.15.14	 So the priests and the Levites made themselves holy in order to move the ark of the L
1CH.15.15	 The Levites carried God’s ark on their shoulders. They used poles as Moses had commanded according to the L
1CH.15.16	 David told the Levite leaders to appoint some of their relatives to serve as musicians. They were expected to play music on harps, lyres, and cymbals to produce joyful music for singing. 
1CH.15.17	 So the Levites appointed Heman, son of Joel, and from his relatives they appointed Asaph, Berechiah’s son. From their own relatives, Merari’s descendants, they appointed Ethan, son of Kushaiah. 
1CH.15.18	 In addition, they appointed their relatives from the second division: Zechariah,
1CH.15.19	 The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were appointed to play bronze cymbals. 
1CH.15.20	 Zechariah, Jaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were appointed to play harps according to 
1CH.15.21	 Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were appointed to play lyres and to conduct the 
1CH.15.22	 Chenaniah, a Levite leader, instructed others how to sing prophetic songs because he was skilled at it. 
1CH.15.23	 Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark. 
1CH.15.24	 The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer blew trumpets in front of God’s ark. Obed Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1CH.15.25	 So David, the leaders of Israel, and the army’s commanders joyfully went to get the ark of the L
1CH.15.26	 Because God helped the Levites who carried the ark of the L
1CH.15.27	 David was dressed in a fine linen robe, as were all the Levites who carried the ark, the ⌊Levites who were⌋ singers, and Chenaniah, the leader of the musicians’ prophetic songs. David also wore a linen ephod.
1CH.15.28	 All Israel brought the ark of the L
1CH.15.29	 When the ark of the L
1CH.16.1	 The men carrying the ark set it inside the tent David had put up for it. They presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in God’s presence. 
1CH.16.2	 When David had finished sacrificing burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the L
1CH.16.3	 He also distributed to every person in Israel—both men and women—a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.
1CH.16.4	 David appointed some Levites to serve in front of the L
1CH.16.5	 Asaph was the head; Zechariah was second, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed Edom, and Jeiel with harps and lyres. Asaph played the cymbals. 
1CH.16.6	 The priests Benaiah and Jahaziel played trumpets all the time in front of the ark of God’s promise. 
1CH.16.7	 For the first time David entrusted Asaph and his relatives with the task of singing songs of thanks to the L
1CH.16.8	 “Give thanks to the L
1CH.16.8	Call on his name.
1CH.16.8	Make known among the nations what he has done.

1CH.16.9	Meditate on all the miracles he has done.
1CH.16.10	 Brag about his holy name.
1CH.16.10	Let the hearts of those who seek the L
1CH.16.11	 Search for the L
1CH.16.11	Always seek his presence.
1CH.16.12	 Remember the miracles he performed,

1CH.16.13	you descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones.
1CH.16.14	 “He is the L
1CH.16.14	His judgments are pronounced throughout the earth.
1CH.16.15	 Remember his promise 
1CH.16.15	the word that he commanded for a thousand generations,
1CH.16.16	 the promise that he made to Abraham,
1CH.16.16	and his sworn promise to Isaac.
1CH.16.17	 He confirmed it as a law for Jacob,
1CH.16.17	as an everlasting promise to Israel,
1CH.16.18	 by saying, ‘I will give you Canaan.
1CH.16.18	It is your share of the inheritance.’
1CH.16.19	 “While they were few in number,

1CH.16.20	 they wandered from nation to nation
1CH.16.20	and from one kingdom to another.
1CH.16.21	 He didn’t permit anyone to oppress them.
1CH.16.21	He warned kings about them:
1CH.16.22	 ‘Do not touch my anointed ones
1CH.16.22	or harm my prophets.’
1CH.16.23	 “Sing to the L

1CH.16.26	The L

1CH.16.36	 Thanks be to the L
1CH.16.36	from everlasting to everlasting.”
1CH.16.36	Then all the people said amen and praised the L
1CH.16.37	 David left Asaph and his relatives to serve continually in front of the ark of the L
1CH.16.38	 David also left Obed Edom and 68 of his relatives ⌊to serve there⌋. Obed Edom (Jeduthun’s son) and Hosah were to be gatekeepers. 
1CH.16.39	 David left Zadok and his priestly relatives to serve in the L
1CH.16.40	 They were ordered to sacrifice burnt offerings to the L
1CH.16.41	 With Zadok and his relatives were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest of the Levites who had been selected, chosen by name, to give thanks to the L
1CH.16.42	 Also, Heman and Jeduthun played trumpets, cymbals, and the ⌊other⌋ musical instruments that accompany sacred songs. Jeduthun’s sons were stationed at the gate.
1CH.16.43	 Then all the people went home. David went back to bless his family.
1CH.17.1	 When David was living in his house, he said to the prophet Nathan, “I’m living in a house made of cedar, while the ark of the L
1CH.17.2	 Nathan told David, “Do everything you have in mind, because God is with you.”
1CH.17.3	 But that same night God spoke his word to Nathan: 
1CH.17.4	 “Say to David, my servant, ‘This is what the L
1CH.17.5	 I haven’t lived in a house from the day I brought Israel out ⌊of Egypt⌋ to this day, but I’ve gone from tent site to tent site, moving the tent ⌊of meeting⌋ from one location ⌊to another⌋. 
1CH.17.6	 In all the places I’ve moved with all Israel, did I ever ask any of the judges of Israel whom I ordered to be shepherds of my people why they didn’t build me a house of cedar?’
1CH.17.7	 “Now this is what you will say to my servant David: ‘This is what the L
1CH.17.8	 I was with you wherever you went, and I destroyed all your enemies in front of you. I will make your name like the names of the greatest people on earth. 
1CH.17.9	 I will make a place for my people Israel and plant them there. They will live in their own place and not be troubled anymore. The wicked will no longer frighten them as they used to do

1CH.17.13	 I will be his Father, and he will be my Son. And I will never stop showing him my love as I did to your predecessor. 
1CH.17.14	 I will place him in my royal house forever, and his throne will be established forever.’ ”
1CH.17.15	 Nathan told David all these words and everything he had seen.
1CH.17.16	 Then King David went into the tent and sat in front of the L
1CH.17.17	 And this you consider to be a small act, God. You’ve spoken about the distant future of my house. L

1CH.18.1	 After this, David defeated and crushed the Philistines. He took Gath and its surrounding villages from them.
1CH.18.2	 He also defeated Moab, and the Moabites became David’s subjects and paid taxes ⌊to him⌋.
1CH.18.3	 When David went to establish his control ⌊over the territory⌋ along the Euphrates River, he defeated King Hadadezer at Hamath. 
1CH.18.4	 David took 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers from him. David also disabled all but 100 of their horses so that they couldn’t pull chariots.
1CH.18.5	 When the Arameans from Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David killed 22,000 of them. 
1CH.18.6	 David put troops in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became his subjects and paid taxes ⌊to him⌋. Everywhere David went, the L
1CH.18.7	 David took the gold shields that Hadadezer’s servants carried, and he brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	 David also took a large quantity of bronze from Tibhath and Cun, Hadadezer’s cities. (⌊Later⌋ Solomon used it to make the pool, pillars, and utensils ⌊for the temple⌋.)
1CH.18.9	 When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Zobah’s King Hadadezer, 
1CH.18.10	 he sent his son Hadoram to greet King David and congratulate him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer. (There had often been war between Hadadezer and Tou.) 
1CH.18.11	 King David dedicated all the articles of gold, silver, and bronze to the L
1CH.18.12	 Zeruiah’s son Abishai killed 18,000 Edomites in the Dead Sea region. 
1CH.18.13	 He put troops in Edom, and all its people became David’s subjects. Everywhere David went, the L
1CH.18.14	 So David ruled all Israel. He did what was fair and right for all his people. 
1CH.18.15	 Zeruiah’s son Joab was in charge of the army. Ahilud’s son Jehoshaphat was the royal historian. 
1CH.18.16	 Ahitub’s son Zadok and Abiathar’s son Abimelech 
1CH.18.17	 Jehoiada’s son Benaiah was commander of the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And David’s sons were his main officials.
1CH.19.1	 Later King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son became king in his place. 
1CH.19.2	 David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun because his father Nahash showed me kindness.” So David sent messengers to comfort Hanun after his father’s ⌊death⌋. But when David’s servants entered Ammon ite territory to comfort Hanun, 
1CH.19.3	 the Ammon ite princes asked Hanun, “Do you think David is honoring your father because he sent men to comfort you? Haven’t his servants come to explore, destroy, and spy on the country?” 
1CH.19.4	 So Hanun took David’s men, shaved them, cut off their clothes from the waist down, and sent them away.
1CH.19.5	 After people told David ⌊what had happened⌋ to the men, he sent ⌊someone⌋ to meet them because they were deeply humiliated. The king said to them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return ⌊to Jerusalem⌋.”
1CH.19.6	 The Ammonites realized that they had made themselves offensive to David. So Hanun and the Ammonites sent 75,000 pounds of silver to hire chariots and horses from the Arameans in Upper Mesopotamia, Maacah, and Zobah. 
1CH.19.7	 They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army. They camped near Medeba. The Ammonites gathered for the battle from their cities.
1CH.19.8	 After David heard about this, he sent Joab and all the elite troops. 
1CH.19.9	 The Ammonites formed a battle line at the entrance of the city, while the Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the kings who had come remained by themselves in the open country.
1CH.19.10	 When Joab saw he was under attack in front and behind, he took the select troops of Israel and organized them for combat against the Arameans. 
1CH.19.11	 He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the troops. They organized for combat against the Ammonites.
1CH.19.12	 Joab said, “If the Arameans are too strong for my ⌊troops⌋, be ready to help me. And if the Ammonites are too strong for your ⌊troops⌋, I’ll help you. 
1CH.19.13	 Be strong! Let’s prove ourselves strong for our people and for the cities of our God, and the L
1CH.19.14	 Then Joab and his troops advanced to fight the Arameans, and the Arameans fled. 
1CH.19.15	 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they, too, fled from Joab’s brother Abishai and went into the city. So Joab returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	 Realizing that Israel had defeated them, the kings sent ⌊messengers⌋ to get ⌊other⌋ Arameans from beyond the Euphrates River. Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army, led them.
1CH.19.17	 When David was told ⌊about this⌋, he assembled Israel’s army, crossed the Jordan, and confronted them. David formed a battle line against the Arameans, and they fought him. 
1CH.19.18	 The Arameans fled from Israel, and David killed 7,000 chariot drivers and 40,000 foot soldiers. David also killed Shophach. 
1CH.19.19	 When all the kings who were subject to Hadadezer saw that Israel had defeated them, they made peace with David and became his subjects. And the Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.
1CH.20.1	 In the spring, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led the army ⌊to war⌋. They destroyed the Ammonites and came to Rabbah to attack it, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab defeated Rabbah and tore it down. 
1CH.20.2	 He took the gold crown from the head of Rabbah’s king and put it on David’s head. (The crown was found to weigh 75 pounds, and in it was a precious stone.) David also took a lot of goods from the city. 
1CH.20.3	 He brought out the troops who were there and put them to work with saws, hoes, and axes.
1CH.20.4	 After this, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. Then Sibbecai from Hushah 
1CH.20.5	 When more fighting broke out with the Philistines, Elhanan, son of Jair, killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath from Gath. (The shaft of Lahmi’s spear was like a beam used by weavers.) 
1CH.20.6	 In another battle at Gath, there was a tall man who had 24 fingers and toes: six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He also was a descendant of Haraphah. 
1CH.20.7	 When he challenged Israel, Jonathan, son of David’s brother Shimea, killed him. 
1CH.20.8	 These ⌊men⌋ were the descendants of Haraphah from Gath, and David and his men killed them.
1CH.21.1	 Satan attempted to attack Israel by provoking David to count the Israelites. 
1CH.21.2	 David said to Joab and the leaders of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan. Bring me ⌊the results⌋ so that I may know how many ⌊people⌋ there are.”
1CH.21.3	 Joab responded, “May the L
1CH.21.4	 However, the king overruled Joab. So Joab left, went throughout Israel, and returned to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	 Joab reported the census figures to David: In Israel there were 1,100,000 men who could serve in the army, and in Judah there were 470,000 who could serve in the army. 
1CH.21.6	 Joab didn’t include Levi and Benjamin in the number because he was disgusted with the king’s order.
1CH.21.7	 God considered the census to be sinful, so he struck Israel ⌊with a plague⌋.
1CH.21.8	 David said to God, “I have committed a terrible sin by doing this thing. Forgive me because I have acted very foolishly.”
1CH.21.9	 The L
1CH.21.10	 “Go and tell David, ‘This is what the L
1CH.21.11	 When Gad came to David, he said, “This is what the L

1CH.21.19	 David went as Gad had told him in the L
1CH.21.20	 Now, Ornan had turned around and seen the Messenger. Ornan’s four sons who were with him hid, but Ornan kept on threshing the wheat.
1CH.21.21	 When David arrived, Ornan looked up and saw him. So he left the threshing floor and bowed down with his face touching the ground in front of David. 
1CH.21.22	 David said to Ornan, “Let me have the land this threshing floor is on. I’ll build an altar for the L
1CH.21.23	 Ornan said to David, “Take it, Your Majesty, and do whatever you think is right. I’ll give you oxen for the burnt offering, threshers

1CH.21.25	 So David gave Ornan 15 pounds of gold for that place.
1CH.21.26	 David built an altar for the L

1CH.22.4	 The men of Sidon and Tyre brought David so many cedar logs that the logs couldn’t be counted.

1CH.23.2	 He gathered all the officials of Israel and the priests and Levites. 
1CH.23.3	 Every male Levite who was at least 30 years old was counted. There were 38,000.

1CH.23.6	 David organized the Levites into divisions based on which of Levi’s sons (Gershon, Kohath, or Merari) they were descended from.
1CH.23.7	 Ladan and Shimei were Gershon’s descendants. 
1CH.23.8	 Ladan had three sons: Jehiel was the first, then Zetham, and Joel. 
1CH.23.9	 Shimei had three sons: Shelomith, Haziel, and Haran. They were the heads of Ladan’s families. 
1CH.23.10	 Shimei’s sons were Jahath, Zina,
1CH.23.11	 Jahath was the first, and Ziza was the second. Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons, so they were given an assignment as one family.
1CH.23.12	 Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
1CH.23.13	 Amram’s sons were Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his sons were forever designated to dedicate the most holy things ⌊to God⌋, to offer sacrifices to the L
1CH.23.14	 The sons of Moses, the man of God, were counted with the tribe of Levi. 
1CH.23.15	 Moses’ sons were Gershom and Eliezer. 
1CH.23.16	 Gershom’s only son was Shebuel. 
1CH.23.17	 Eliezer’s only son was Rehabiah. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many sons. 
1CH.23.18	 Izhar’s only son was Shelomith. 
1CH.23.19	 Hebron’s first son was Jeriah; his second was Amariah; his third was Jahaziel; his fourth was Jekameam. 
1CH.23.20	 Uzziel’s first son was Micah; his second was Isshiah.
1CH.23.21	 Merari’s sons were Mahli and Mushi. Mahli’s sons were Eleazar and Kish. 
1CH.23.22	 Eleazar died without having any sons. He only had daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them. 
1CH.23.23	 Mushi had three sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.
1CH.23.24	 These were Levi’s descendants, who were grouped according to their families. The heads of their families were registered by name as they were counted. Everyone who served in the L

1CH.23.27	 David’s last instructions were to count the Levites who were at least 20 years old. 
1CH.23.28	 They were appointed to stand beside Aaron’s descendants to serve in the L
1CH.23.29	 They were also responsible for the rows of bread, the flour for the grain offerings, the unleavened bread wafers, and the bread made in frying pans. In addition, they were responsible for mixing the ingredients and keeping track of all weights and measures.

1CH.24.1	 The divisions of Aaron’s descendants were as follows: Aaron’s sons were Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
1CH.24.2	 Nadab and Abihu died before their father died, and neither had any children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
1CH.24.3	 David, Eleazar’s descendant Zadok, and Ithamar’s descendant Ahimelech divided Aaron’s descendants into groups for service. 
1CH.24.4	 Since Eleazar’s descendants had more men who were family heads than Ithamar’s descendants, they were divided so that Eleazar’s descendants had 16 family leaders and Ithamar’s descendants had 8 family leaders. 
1CH.24.5	 Both groups were divided impartially by drawing lots so that there were officers for the holy place and officers for God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants. 
1CH.24.6	 The scribe Shemaiah was a son of Nethanel and a descendant of Levi. Shemaiah recorded their names in the presence of the king, the princes, the priest Zadok, Ahimelech (son of Abiathar), and the family leaders of the priests and Levites. One family was chosen for Eleazar, another for Ithamar.
1CH.24.7	 The first lot drawn was for Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah,

1CH.24.30	These were Levi’s descendants according to their families. 
1CH.24.31	 They drew lots as their relatives, Aaron’s descendants, had done. They drew them in front of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the leaders of the families of the priests and Levites. The families of the oldest brother were treated the same way as those of the youngest.

1CH.29.4	 There are 225,000 pounds of gold from Ophir and 525,000 pounds of refined silver. They are to be used to cover the walls of the buildings,

1CH.29.6	 Then the leaders of the families, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of regiments and battalions, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave generously. 
1CH.29.7	 They gave 375,186 pounds of gold, 750,000 pounds of silver, 135,000 pounds of bronze, and 7,500,000 pounds of iron for the work on God’s temple.

1CH.29.12	You rule everything.

1CH.29.14	Everything comes from you.
1CH.29.14	We give you only what has come from your hands.
1CH.29.15	 To you we are all like our ancestors—
1CH.29.15	foreigners without permanent homes.

1CH.29.24	 All the leaders and soldiers and all of King David’s sons pledged their loyalty to King Solomon. 
1CH.29.25	 The L
1CH.29.26	 David, son of Jesse, had ruled all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	 He ruled as king of Israel for 40 years. He ruled for 7 years in Hebron and for 33 in Jerusalem. 
1CH.29.28	 He died at a very old age. His long life was full of wealth and honor. Then his son Solomon succeeded him as king.
1CH.29.29	 Everything about King David from first to last is written in the records of the seer 
1CH.29.30	 It includes everything about his reign, his power, and the things that happened to him, Israel, and all the other kingdoms.
2CH.1.1	 Solomon, son of David, strengthened his position over the kingdom. The L
2CH.1.2	 Solomon spoke to all Israel—to the commanders of regiments and battalions, judges, every prince, and the heads of Israel’s families.

2CH.1.7	 That night God appeared to Solomon. He said, “What can I give you?”
2CH.1.8	 Solomon responded to God, “You’ve shown great love to my father David, and you’ve made me king in his place. 
2CH.1.9	 Now, L
2CH.1.10	 Give me wisdom and knowledge so that I may lead these people. After all, who can judge this great people of yours?”
2CH.1.11	 God replied to Solomon, “I know this request is from your heart. You didn’t ask for riches, fortunes, honor, or the death of those who hate you. You didn’t even ask for a long life. Instead, you’ve asked for wisdom and knowledge to judge my people, over whom I made you king. 
2CH.1.12	 So wisdom and knowledge will be given to you. I will also give you riches, fortunes, and honor like no other king before or after you.”
2CH.1.13	 Solomon went from the tent of meeting at the place of worship in Gibeon to Jerusalem. And he ruled Israel.
2CH.1.14	 Solomon built up ⌊his army⌋ with chariots and war horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 war horses. He stationed ⌊some⌋ in chariot cities and ⌊others⌋ with himself in Jerusalem.
2CH.1.15	 The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as plentiful as fig trees in the foothills.
2CH.1.16	 Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue. The king’s traders bought them from Kue for a fixed price. 
2CH.1.17	 They imported each chariot from Egypt for 15 pounds of silver and each horse for 6 ounces of silver. For the same price they obtained horses to export to all the Hittite and Aramean kings.
2CH.2.1	 Solomon gave orders to begin building the temple for the L
2CH.2.2	 Solomon drafted 70,000 men to carry heavy loads, 80,000 to quarry stones in the mountains, and 3,600 foremen. 
2CH.2.3	 Solomon sent word to King Huram of Tyre by saying, “Do what you did for my father David. You sent him cedar so that he could build a palace to live in. 
2CH.2.4	 I want to build the temple for the name of the L
2CH.2.5	 The temple I am building will be great because our God is greater than all other gods. 
2CH.2.6	 But who is able to build him a temple when heaven itself, the highest heaven, cannot hold him? Who am I to build him a temple except as a place to sacrifice in his presence?
2CH.2.7	 “Send me a man who has the skill to work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron as well as purple, dark red, and violet cloth. He should know how to make engravings with the skilled men whom my father David provided for me in Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.2.8	 Send me cedar, cypress, and sandalwood from Lebanon. I know that your servants are skilled Lebanese lumberjacks. My workers will work with your workers. 
2CH.2.9	 They’ll prepare plenty of lumber for me, because the temple I want to build will be large and astonishing. 
2CH.2.10	 I will give your lumberjacks 120,000 bushels of ground wheat, 120,000 bushels of barley, 200,000 gallons of wine, and 200,000 gallons of olive oil.”
2CH.2.11	 Then King Huram of Tyre responded to Solomon by sending a letter that said, “Because the L
2CH.2.12	 Huram added, “May the L
2CH.2.13	 And now, I’m sending a man with skill and intelligence—Huram Abi. 
2CH.2.14	 He was the son of a woman from the tribe of Dan, and his father is a native of Tyre. Huram knows how to work with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, wood, purple, violet, and dark red cloth, and linen. He also knows how to make all kinds of engravings and follow any set of plans that will be given to him. ⌊He can work⌋ with your skilled workmen and the skilled workmen of His Majesty David, your father. 
2CH.2.15	 Your Majesty may now send the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine he promised the workers. 
2CH.2.16	 We will cut all the lumber you need in Lebanon. Then we will make rafts out of it and send them to you in Joppa by sea. You can take it ⌊from there⌋ to Jerusalem.”
2CH.2.17	 Solomon counted all the men who were foreigners in the land of Israel, as his father David had counted them. Solomon counted 153,600 foreigners. 
2CH.2.18	 He made 70,000 of them carry heavy loads, 80,000 of them quarry stone in the mountains, and 3,600 of them supervise the work as foremen.
2CH.3.1	 Solomon began to build the L
2CH.3.2	 He began to build on the second day in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
2CH.3.3	 This is how Solomon laid the foundation to build God’s temple. It was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide. (They used the old standard measurement.) 
2CH.3.4	 The entrance hall in front of ⌊the main room⌋ was 30 feet wide (the same as the width of the temple) and 30 feet high. He covered its inside walls with pure gold. 
2CH.3.5	 He paneled the larger building with cypress, overlaid it with fine gold, and decorated it with ⌊designs in the form of⌋ palm trees and chains. 
2CH.3.6	 He covered the building with gems to beautify it and used gold from Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	 He also overlaid the building, the rafters, the threshold, the walls, and the doors with gold, and he carved angels 
2CH.3.8	 He made the most holy place. It was as long as the temple was wide, 30 feet long. It was also 30 feet wide. He overlaid it with 45,000 pounds of fine gold. 
2CH.3.9	 The gold nails weighed 20 ounces. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.
2CH.3.10	 In the most holy place he made two sculptured angels and covered them with gold. 
2CH.3.11	 The combined length of the angels’ wings was 30 feet. A wing of one of the angels was 7½ feet long and touched the wall of the building. Its other wing was 7½ feet long and touched one wing of the other. 
2CH.3.12	 The wing of the other one of the angels was 7½ feet long and touched the other wall of the building. Its other wing was 7½ feet long and touched the wing of the first. So the angels’ combined wingspan was 30 feet. 
2CH.3.13	 They stood on their feet and faced the main hall. 
2CH.3.14	 Solomon made the canopy of violet, purple, and dark red cloth and of linen and decorated it with angels.
2CH.3.15	 He made two pillars for the front of the temple. They were 53 feet long, and the capital on each pillar was 7½ feet ⌊high⌋. 
2CH.3.16	 He made chains for the inner room and ⌊also⌋ put them on the capitals. He made 100 pomegranates and put them on the chains. 
2CH.3.17	 He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right and the other on the left. He named the one on the right Jachin [He Establishes] and the one on the left Boaz [In Him Is Strength].
2CH.4.1	 He made a bronze altar 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet high.
2CH.4.2	 Huram made a pool from cast metal. It was 15 feet in diameter. It was round, 7½ feet high, and had a circumference of 45 feet. 
2CH.4.3	 Under the rim were two rows of figurines shaped like bulls all around the 45-foot circumference of the pool. They were cast in metal when the pool was cast. 
2CH.4.4	 The pool was set on 12 metal bulls. Three bulls faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. The pool was set on them, and their hindquarters were toward the center ⌊of the pool⌋. 
2CH.4.5	 The pool was three inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup, shaped like a lily’s bud. It held 18,000 gallons.
2CH.4.6	 Huram also made ten basins for washing and put five on the south side and five on the north side. The priests rinsed the meat prepared for the burnt offerings in them. They used the pool to wash themselves.
2CH.4.7	 Huram made ten gold lamp stands according to their specifications and put them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north side. 
2CH.4.8	 He made ten tables and put them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north side. And he made 100 gold bowls.
2CH.4.9	 He also made the priests’ courtyard and the large courtyard and its doors. He covered the doors with bronze. 
2CH.4.10	 He set the pool on the south side in the southeast ⌊corner⌋. 
2CH.4.11	 Huram also made the pots, shovels, and bowls.
2CH.4.11	So Huram finished the work for King Solomon in God’s temple: 
2CH.4.12	 2 pillars, bowl-shaped capitals on top of the 2 pillars, and 2 sets of filigree to cover the 2 bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars, 
2CH.4.13	 400 pomegranates for the 2 sets of filigree (2 rows of pomegranates for each filigree to cover the 2 bowl-shaped capitals on the pillars), 
2CH.4.14	 10 stands and 10 
2CH.4.15	 1 pool and the 12 bulls under it, 
2CH.4.16	 pots, shovels, and three-pronged forks. Huram made all of them out of polished bronze for the L
2CH.4.17	 The king cast them in foundries in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah. 
2CH.4.18	 Solomon made so many of these products that no one tried to determine how much the bronze weighed.
2CH.4.19	 Solomon made all the furnishings for God’s temple: the gold altar, the gold tables on which the bread of the presence was placed, 
2CH.4.20	 lamp stands and lamps of pure gold (to burn as directed in front of the inner room), 
2CH.4.21	 flowers, lamps, pure gold tongs, 
2CH.4.22	 snuffers, basins, dishes, incense burners of pure gold, the gold entrance to the temple, the gold doors of the inner ⌊room⌋ (the most holy place), and the gold doors of the temple.
2CH.5.1	 All the work Solomon did on the L
2CH.5.2	 Then Solomon assembled the respected leaders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the Israelite families. They came to Jerusalem to take the ark of the L
2CH.5.3	 All the men of Israel gathered around the king at the Festival ⌊of Booths⌋ in the seventh month.
2CH.5.4	 When all the leaders of Israel had arrived, the Levites picked up the ark. 
2CH.5.5	 They brought the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy utensils in it ⌊to the temple⌋. The priests and the Levites carried them 
2CH.5.6	 while King Solomon and the whole assembly from Israel were offering countless sheep and cattle sacrifices in front of the ark. 
2CH.5.7	 The priests brought the ark of the L
2CH.5.8	 The angels’ outstretched wings were over the place where the ark ⌊rested⌋ so that the angels became a covering above the ark and its poles. 
2CH.5.9	 The poles were so long that their ends could be seen in the holy place by anyone standing in front of the inner room,
2CH.5.10	 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets Moses placed there at Horeb, where the L
2CH.5.11	 All the priests who were present had performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy to God without regard to staying in their divisions. 
2CH.5.12	 All the Levites who were musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their sons, and their relatives—were dressed in fine linen and stood east of the altar with cymbals, harps, and lyres. With the musicians were 120 priests blowing trumpets. When the priests left the holy place,
2CH.5.13	 the trumpeters and singers praised and thanked the L
2CH.5.14	 The priests couldn’t serve because of the cloud. The L
2CH.6.1	 Then Solomon said, “The L
2CH.6.2	 But I have built you a high temple, a home for you to live in permanently.”
2CH.6.3	 Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly from Israel while they were standing. 
2CH.6.4	 “Thanks be to the L
2CH.6.5	 ‘Ever since I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I didn’t choose any city from the tribes of Israel as a place to build a temple for my name. And I didn’t choose any man to be prince over my people Israel. 
2CH.6.6	 But now I’ve chosen Jerusalem to be a place for my name; I’ve chosen David to rule my people Israel.’
2CH.6.7	 “My father David had his heart set on building a temple for the name of the L
2CH.6.8	 However, the L
2CH.6.9	 But you must not build the temple. Instead, your own son will build the temple for my name.’ 
2CH.6.10	 The L
2CH.6.11	 I’ve put the ark which contains the L
2CH.6.12	 In the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, Solomon stood in front of the L
2CH.6.13	 (Solomon had made a bronze platform 7½ feet long, 7½ feet wide, and 4½ feet high. He put it in the middle of the courtyard. He stood on the platform, knelt in front of the entire assembly, and stretched out his hands toward heaven.) 
2CH.6.14	 He said,
2CH.6.14	“L
2CH.6.14	there is no god like you in heaven or on earth.
2CH.6.14	You keep your promise 
2CH.6.14	who obey you wholeheartedly.
2CH.6.15	 You have kept your promise to my father David, your servant.
2CH.6.15	With your mouth you promised it.
2CH.6.15	With your hand you carried it out as it is today.
2CH.6.16	 “Now, L
2CH.6.16	keep your promise to my father David, your servant.
2CH.6.16	You said, ‘You will never fail to have an heir
2CH.6.16	sitting in front of me on the throne of Israel
2CH.6.16	if your descendants are faithful to me
2CH.6.16	as you have been faithful to me.’
2CH.6.17	 “So now, L
2CH.6.17	may the promise you made to David, your servant, come true.
2CH.6.18	 “Does God really live on earth with people?

2CH.6.19	Listen to my cry for help as I pray to you.
2CH.6.20	 Day and night may your eyes be on this temple,
2CH.6.20	the place about which you said your name will be there.
2CH.6.20	Listen to me as I pray toward this place.

2CH.6.21	that your people Israel and I pray toward this place.

2CH.6.23	Repay the guilty person with the proper punishment,
2CH.6.23	but declare the innocent person innocent.
2CH.6.24	 “An enemy may defeat your people Israel
2CH.6.24	because they have sinned against you.
2CH.6.24	But when your people turn, praise your name, pray,

2CH.6.27	Teach them the proper way to live.
2CH.6.27	Then send rain on the land,

2CH.6.28	 “There may be famine in the land.

2CH.6.30	(You know what is in their hearts,

2CH.6.31	 Then, as long as they live in the land that you gave to our ancestors,
2CH.6.31	they will fear you and follow you.
2CH.6.32	 “People who are not Israelites

2CH.7.19	 But if you and your descendants turn away from me
2CH.7.19	and abandon my commands and laws that I gave you,
2CH.7.19	and follow and serve other gods and worship them,
2CH.7.20	 then I will uproot Israel from the land I gave them.
2CH.7.20	I will reject this temple that I declared holy for my name.
2CH.7.20	I will make it an example
2CH.7.20	and an object of ridicule for all the people of the world.

2CH.8.1	 It took Solomon 20 years to build the L
2CH.8.2	 He rebuilt the cities Huram gave him, and he had Israelites live in them.
2CH.8.3	 Then Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and conquered it. 
2CH.8.4	 He rebuilt Tadmor in the desert and built all the storage cities in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	 He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon into cities fortified with walls, double-door gates, and bars. 
2CH.8.6	 ⌊He also rebuilt⌋ Baalath and all the storage cities that he owned. He built all the cities for his chariots, all the cities for his war horses, and whatever ⌊else⌋ he wanted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, or the entire territory that he governed.
2CH.8.7	 The Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites had been left ⌊in the land⌋ because the Israelites had not been able to destroy them.
2CH.8.8	 but they had descendants who were still in the land. Solomon drafted them for slave labor. (They are still ⌊slaves⌋ today.) 
2CH.8.9	 But Solomon didn’t make any of the Israelites slaves for his projects. Instead, they were the soldiers, officers, generals, and commanders of his chariot and cavalry units.
2CH.8.10	 These were the officers in charge of King Solomon’s projects: 250 foremen for the people who did the work.
2CH.8.11	 Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter from the City of David to a palace he had built for her. He said, “My wife will not live in the palace of King David of Israel because these places where the L

2CH.8.13	 He sacrificed every day, on weekly worship days, on the New Moon Festivals, and on the three annual festivals (the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths) as Moses had commanded. 
2CH.8.14	 As Solomon’s father David had directed, he set up the divisions of priests for their service and the ⌊divisions of⌋ Levites for their appointed places. ⌊The Levites⌋ were to lead in praising ⌊the L
2CH.8.15	 No one neglected the king’s orders to the priests or the Levites in any matter, including the ⌊temple’s⌋ finances. 
2CH.8.16	 All of Solomon’s work was carried out from the day the foundation of the L
2CH.8.17	 Then Solomon went to the coast near Ezion Geber and Elath in Edom. 
2CH.8.18	 Huram sent his own servants and his experienced sailors with ships to Solomon. They went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir, got 33,750 pounds of gold, and brought it to King Solomon.
2CH.9.1	 The queen of Sheba heard about Solomon’s reputation. So she came to Jerusalem to test him with riddles. She arrived with a large group of servants, with camels carrying spices, a large quantity of gold, and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she talked to him about everything she had on her mind. 
2CH.9.2	 Solomon answered all her questions. No question was too difficult for Solomon to answer.
2CH.9.3	 When the queen of Sheba saw Solomon’s wisdom, the palace he built,

2CH.9.5	 She told the king, “What I heard in my country about your words and your wisdom is true! 
2CH.9.6	 But I didn’t believe the reports until I came and saw it with my own eyes. I wasn’t even told about half of the extent of your wisdom. You’ve surpassed the stories I’ve heard. 
2CH.9.7	 How blessed your men must be! How blessed these servants of yours must be because they are always stationed in front of you and listen to your wisdom! 
2CH.9.8	 Thank the L
2CH.9.9	 She gave the king 9,000 pounds of gold, a very large quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never was there such a large quantity of spices ⌊in Israel⌋ as those that the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.
2CH.9.10	 Huram’s servants and Solomon’s servants who brought gold from Ophir also brought sandalwood and precious stones. 
2CH.9.11	 With the sandalwood the king made gateways to the L
2CH.9.12	 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba anything she wanted, whatever she asked for, more than what she had brought him. Then she and her servants went back to her country.
2CH.9.13	 The gold that came to Solomon in one year weighed 49,950 pounds, 
2CH.9.14	 not counting ⌊the gold⌋ which the merchants and traders brought. All the Arab kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2CH.9.15	 King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold, using 15 pounds of gold on each shield. 
2CH.9.16	 He also made 300 small shields of hammered gold, using 7½ pounds of gold on each shield. The king put them in the hall ⌊named⌋ the Forest of Lebanon.
2CH.9.17	 The king also made a large ivory throne and covered it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	 Six steps led to the throne, which had a gold footstool attached to it. There were armrests on both sides of the seat. Two lions stood beside the armrests. 
2CH.9.19	 Twelve lions stood on six steps, one on each side. Nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.
2CH.9.20	 All King Solomon’s cups were gold, and all the utensils for the hall ⌊named⌋ the Forest of Lebanon were fine gold. (Silver wasn’t considered valuable in Solomon’s time.) 
2CH.9.21	 The king had ships going to Tarshish with Huram’s sailors. Once every three years the Tarshish ships would bring gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys.
2CH.9.22	 In wealth and wisdom King Solomon was greater than all the ⌊other⌋ kings of the world. 
2CH.9.23	 All the kings of the world wanted to listen to the wisdom that God gave Solomon. 
2CH.9.24	 So everyone who came brought him gifts: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This happened year after year.
2CH.9.25	 Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 war horses. He stationed ⌊some⌋ in chariot cities and ⌊others⌋ with himself in Jerusalem. 
2CH.9.26	 He ruled all the kings from the Euphrates River to the country of the Philistines and as far as the Egyptian border. 
2CH.9.27	 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as plentiful as fig trees in the foothills. 
2CH.9.28	 Horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all other countries.
2CH.9.29	 Aren’t the rest of Solomon’s acts from first to last written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah from Shiloh, and in Iddo the seer’s 
2CH.9.30	 Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for 40 years. 
2CH.9.31	 Solomon lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. His son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.
2CH.10.1	 Rehoboam went to Shechem because all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	 Jer o boam (Nebat’s son) was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon. When he heard ⌊about Rehoboam⌋, he returned from Egypt. 
2CH.10.3	 ⌊Israel⌋ sent for Jer o boam and invited him back. Jer o boam and all Israel went to speak to Rehoboam. They said, 
2CH.10.4	 “Your father made us carry a heavy burden. Reduce the hard work and lighten the heavy burden he put on us, and we will serve you.”
2CH.10.5	 He said to them, “Come back the day after tomorrow.” So the people left.
2CH.10.6	 King Rehoboam sought advice from the older leaders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive. He asked, “What do you advise? How should I respond to these people?”
2CH.10.7	 They told him, “If you are good to these people and try to please them by speaking gently to them, then they will always be your servants.”
2CH.10.8	 But he ignored the advice the older leaders gave him. He sought advice from the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. 
2CH.10.9	 He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we respond to these people who are asking me to lighten the burden my father put on them?”
2CH.10.10	 The young men who had grown up with him answered, “This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is heavier than my father’s whole body.
2CH.10.11	 If my father put a heavy burden on you, I will add to it. If my father punished you with whips, I will punish you with scorpions.’ ”
2CH.10.12	 So Jer o boam and all the people came back to Rehoboam two days later, as the king had instructed them. 
2CH.10.13	 The king answered them harshly. He ignored the older leaders’ advice. 
2CH.10.14	 He spoke to them as the young men advised. He said, “If my father made your burden heavy, I will add to it. If my father punished you with whips, I will use scorpions.” 
2CH.10.15	 The king refused to listen to the people because the L
2CH.10.16	 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king,
2CH.10.16	“What share do we have in David’s kingdom?
2CH.10.16	We won’t receive an inheritance from Jesse’s son.
2CH.10.16	Everyone to his own tent, Israel!
2CH.10.16	Now look after your own house, David!”
2CH.10.16	So all Israel went home to their own tents. 
2CH.10.17	 But Rehoboam ruled the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.
2CH.10.18	 Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram to the Israelites. He was in charge of forced labor, but they stoned him to death. So King Rehoboam got on his chariot as fast as he could and fled to Jerusalem. 
2CH.10.19	 Israel has rebelled against David’s dynasty to this day.
2CH.11.1	 When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he gathered the people of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 of the best soldiers, to fight against Israel and return the kingdom to Rehoboam.
2CH.11.2	 But God spoke his word to Shemaiah, the man of God. He said, 
2CH.11.3	 “Speak to Judah’s King Rehoboam, son of Solomon, and all Israel in Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.11.4	 This is what the L
2CH.11.5	 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built fortified cities in Judah. 
2CH.11.6	 He rebuilt Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	 Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	 He strengthened them and put army officers with reserves of food, olive oil, and wine in them. 
2CH.11.12	 In each city he stored shields and spears. He made the cities very secure. So Rehoboam held on to Judah and Benjamin.
2CH.11.13	 The priests and Levites in every region of Israel sided with Rehoboam. 
2CH.11.14	 The priests abandoned their land and property and went to Judah and Jerusalem because Jer o boam and his descendants rejected them as the L
2CH.11.15	 Instead, Jer o boam appointed ⌊his own⌋ priests for the illegal worship sites and the goat and calf statues he had made as idols. 
2CH.11.16	 People from every tribe of Israel who were determined to seek the L
2CH.11.17	 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah by supporting Rehoboam, son of Solomon, for three years. During ⌊those⌋ three years they lived the way David and Solomon had lived.
2CH.11.18	 Rehoboam married Mahalath, daughter of Jerimoth. (Jerimoth was the son of David and Abihail. Abihail was the daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse.) 
2CH.11.19	 Mahalath gave birth to the following sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
2CH.11.20	 After marrying Mahalath, he married Maacah, Absalom’s granddaughter. She gave birth to Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	 Rehoboam loved Maacah, Absalom’s granddaughter, more than all his other wives and concubines.
2CH.11.22	 Rehoboam appointed Abijah, son of Maacah, as family head and prince among his brothers. By doing this, Rehoboam could make him king. 
2CH.11.23	 He wisely placed his sons in every region of Judah and Benjamin, in every fortified city. He gave them allowances and obtained many wives for them.
2CH.12.1	 When Rehoboam had established his kingdom and made himself strong, he and all Israel abandoned the L
2CH.12.2	 In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. This happened because all Israel was not loyal to the L
2CH.12.3	 Shishak had 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horses, and an army of countless Libyans, Sukkites, and Sudanese from Egypt.
2CH.12.4	 He captured the fortified cities in Judah and then came to Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	 The prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who had gathered in Jerusalem because of Shishak. Shemaiah said to them, “This is what the L
2CH.12.6	 Then the commanders of Israel and the king humbled themselves. “The L

2CH.12.8	 But they will become his servants so that they can learn the difference between serving me and serving foreign kings.”
2CH.12.9	 King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took the treasures from the L

2CH.12.12	 After Rehoboam humbled himself, the L
2CH.12.13	 King Rehoboam strengthened his position in Jerusalem and ruled. He was 41 years old when he began to rule. He ruled for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city that the L

2CH.12.15	 Aren’t the events concerning Rehoboam from first to last written in the records of the prophet Shemaiah and the records of the seer 
2CH.12.16	 Rehoboam lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. His son Abijah succeeded him as king.
2CH.13.1	 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jer o boam, Abijah began to rule Judah. 
2CH.13.2	 He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother was named Micaiah, daughter of Uriel from Gibeah.
2CH.13.2	There was war between Abijah and Jer o boam.
2CH.13.3	 Abijah prepared for battle with an army of 400,000 of the best soldiers, while Jer o boam arranged to oppose him with 800,000 of the best professional soldiers.
2CH.13.4	 Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the mountains of Ephraim. He called out, “Jer o boam and all Israel, listen to me! 
2CH.13.5	 Don’t you know that the L
2CH.13.6	 But Jer o boam (Nebat’s son) rebelled against his master. He had been the servant of David’s son Solomon. 
2CH.13.7	 Worthless, good-for-nothing men gathered around him. They opposed Rehoboam, son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was too young and inexperienced to challenge them. 
2CH.13.8	 Do you now intend to challenge the L

2CH.13.13	 But Jer o boam had set an ambush to attack them from behind. So Jer o boam’s army was in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them. 
2CH.13.14	 When Judah’s soldiers looked around, the battle was in front of them and behind them. They cried out to the L
2CH.13.15	 and the men of Judah shouted. When they shouted, God attacked Jer o boam and all Israel in front of Abijah and Judah. 
2CH.13.16	 The Israelites fled from Judah’s ⌊army⌋, and God handed them over to Judah. 
2CH.13.17	 So Abijah and his men defeated them decisively, and 500,000 of the best men of Israel were killed. 
2CH.13.18	 So the Israelites were humbled at that time, and the men of Judah won because they trusted the L
2CH.13.19	 Abijah pursued Jer o boam and captured some of his cities: Bethel and its villages, Jeshanah and its villages, and Ephron and its villages.
2CH.13.20	 Jer o boam never regained power during Abijah’s time. The L
2CH.13.21	 But Abijah became strong. He married 14 wives and fathered 22 sons and 16 daughters.
2CH.13.22	 Everything else about Abijah—how he lived and what he said—is written in the history by the prophet Iddo.
2CH.14.1	 Abijah lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. His son Asa succeeded him as king. In Asa’s time the land had peace for ten years.
2CH.14.2	 Asa did what the L

2CH.14.4	 He told the people of Judah to dedicate their lives to serving the L
2CH.14.5	 He got rid of the illegal places of worship and the altars for incense in all the cities of Judah. The kingdom was at peace during his reign.
2CH.14.6	 He built fortified cities in Judah because the land had peace. There was no war during those years because the L
2CH.14.7	 So Asa told Judah, “Let’s build these cities and make walls around them with towers and doors that can be barred. The country is still ours because we have dedicated our lives to serving the L
2CH.14.8	 Asa had an army of 300,000 Judeans who were armed with large shields and spears and 280,000 Benjaminites who were armed with small shields and bows. All of these men were good fighting men.
2CH.14.9	 Then Zerah from Sudan came with 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots to attack Asa. Zerah got as far as Mareshah. 
2CH.14.10	 Asa went to confront him, and the two armies set up their battle lines in the Zephathah Valley at Mareshah.
2CH.14.11	 Asa called on the L

2CH.14.13	 Asa and his troops pursued them as far as Gerar. Many of the Sudanese died in battle. As a result, the Sudanese army couldn’t fight again. It was crushed in front of the L
2CH.14.14	 It attacked all the cities around Gerar because the cities were afraid of the L
2CH.14.15	 It also attacked those who were letting their cattle graze and captured many sheep and camels. Then it returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	 God’s Spirit came to Azariah, son of Oded. 
2CH.15.2	 Azariah went to Asa and said to him, “Listen to me, Asa and all you men from Judah and Benjamin. The L

2CH.15.5	 At those times no one could come and go in peace, because everyone living in the land had a lot of turmoil. 
2CH.15.6	 One nation crushed another nation; one city crushed another. God had tormented them with every kind of trouble. 
2CH.15.7	 But you must remain strong and not become discouraged. Your actions will be rewarded.”
2CH.15.8	 When Asa heard the prophet Oded’s words of prophecy, he was encouraged and put away the detestable idols from all of Judah, Benjamin, and the cities he had captured in the mountains of Ephraim. He also repaired the L

2CH.15.16	 King Asa also removed his grandmother Maacah from the position of queen mother because she made a statue of the repulsive goddess Asherah. Asa cut the statue down, crushed it, and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
2CH.15.17	 Although the illegal worship sites in Israel were not taken down, Asa remained committed ⌊to the L
2CH.15.18	 He brought into God’s temple the silver, the gold, and the utensils he and his father had set apart as holy.
2CH.15.19	 There was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2CH.16.1	 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and fortified Ramah to keep anyone from going to or coming from King Asa of Judah.
2CH.16.2	 Then Asa brought out all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the L
2CH.16.3	 He said, “There’s a treaty between you and me ⌊as⌋ there was between your father and my father. I’m sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone.”
2CH.16.4	 Benhadad did what King Asa requested. He sent his generals and their armies to attack the cities of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities in the territory of Naphtali. 
2CH.16.5	 When Baasha heard the news, he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned his work on it.
2CH.16.6	 Then King Asa took everyone in Judah ⌊to Ramah⌋. He made them carry the stones and lumber from Ramah. Baasha had been using those to fortify the city. Asa used the materials to fortify Geba in Benjamin and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	 At that time the seer

2CH.16.10	 Asa was furious at the seer. He was so angry with Hanani that he put Hanani in prison. Asa also oppressed some of the people at that time in his reign.
2CH.16.11	 Everything about Asa from first to last is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2CH.16.12	 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa got a foot disease that became progressively worse. Instead of asking the L
2CH.16.13	 Asa lay down in death with his ancestors. He died in the forty-first year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	 They buried him in the tomb that he had prepared for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bed full of spices and blended perfumes. And they burned a bonfire in his honor.
2CH.17.1	 Asa’s son Jehoshaphat succeeded him as king. Jehoshaphat strengthened himself ⌊to wage war⌋ against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	 He put troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and placed military posts in Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
2CH.17.3	 The L
2CH.17.4	 Instead, he dedicated his life to his ancestor’s God and lived by God’s commands. Jehoshaphat did not do what Israel was doing.

2CH.17.7	 In the third year of his reign, he sent his officers Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah. 
2CH.17.8	 With them were the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, Tob Adonijah, and the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 
2CH.17.9	 They taught in Judah. They had the Book of the L

2CH.17.11	 Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as taxes. The Arabs also brought him flocks: 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats. 
2CH.17.12	 So Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful. He built fortresses and cities where supplies were stored in Judah. 
2CH.17.13	 He had large supplies of food in the cities of Judah and an army of professional soldiers with him in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	 The following is a breakdown of these soldiers. They are listed by families. Judah’s regimental commanders were Commander Adnah (with 300,000 fighting men), 
2CH.17.15	 next to him Commander Jehohanan (with 280,000), 
2CH.17.16	 and next to him Amasiah, Zichri’s son, who volunteered to serve the L
2CH.17.17	 From Benjamin there was the fighting man Eliada (with 200,000 armed men with bows and shields), 
2CH.17.18	 and next to him was Jehozabad (with him was an army of 180,000 armed men). 
2CH.17.19	 These were the men who served the king in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
2CH.18.1	 Jehoshaphat was wealthy and honorable and became Ahab’s in-law. 
2CH.18.2	 A few years later he went to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for a banquet in honor of Jehoshaphat and the people who were with him. And Ahab persuaded Jehoshaphat to attack Ramoth in Gilead with him.
2CH.18.3	 King Ahab of Israel asked King Jehoshaphat of Judah, “Will you go with me to Ramoth in Gilead?”
2CH.18.3	Jehoshaphat told the king of Israel, “I will do what you do. My troops will do what your troops do. ⌊We will join⌋ your troops in battle.” 
2CH.18.4	 Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “But first, find out what the word of the L
2CH.18.5	 So the king of Israel called 400 prophets together. He asked them, “Should we go to war against Ramoth in Gilead or not?”
2CH.18.5	“Go,” they said. “God will hand over Ramoth to you.”
2CH.18.6	 But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of the L
2CH.18.7	 The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, “We can ask the L
2CH.18.7	Jehoshaphat answered, “The king must not say that.”
2CH.18.8	 The king of Israel called for an officer and said, “Quick! ⌊Get⌋ Micaiah, son of Imla!”
2CH.18.9	 The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were dressed in royal robes and seated on thrones. They were sitting on the threshing floor 
2CH.18.10	 Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said, “This is what the L

2CH.18.18	 Micaiah added, “Then hear the word of the L

2CH.18.24	 Micaiah answered, “You will find out on the day you go into an inner room to hide.”
2CH.18.25	 The king of Israel then said, “Send Micaiah back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the prince. 
2CH.18.26	 Say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return home safely.’ ”
2CH.18.27	 Micaiah said, “If you really do come back safely, then the L
2CH.18.28	 So the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to Ramoth in Gilead. 
2CH.18.29	 The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you should wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
2CH.18.30	 The king of Aram had given orders to the chariot commanders. He said, “Don’t fight anyone except the king of Israel.”
2CH.18.31	 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “He must be the king of Israel.” So they surrounded him in order to fight him. But when Jehoshaphat cried out, the L
2CH.18.32	 and the chariot commanders realized that Jehoshaphat wasn’t the king of Israel. Then they turned away from him.
2CH.18.33	 One man aimed his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between his scale armor and his breastplate. Ahab told the chariot driver, “Turn around, and get me away from these troops. I’m badly wounded.” 
2CH.18.34	 But the battle got worse that day, and the king propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. At sundown he died.
2CH.19.1	 King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his home in Jerusalem.

2CH.20.23	 Then the Ammonites and Moabites attacked the people from Mount Seir and annihilated them. After they had finished off the people of Seir, they helped destroy one another.
2CH.20.24	 The people of Judah went to the watchtower in the desert and looked for the crowd. Corpses were lying on the ground. No one had escaped. 
2CH.20.25	 When Jehoshaphat and his troops came to take the loot, they found among them a lot of goods, clothes,

2CH.20.30	 Jehoshaphat’s kingdom was peaceful, since his God surrounded him with peace.
2CH.20.31	 Jehoshaphat ruled as king of Judah. He was 35 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi. 
2CH.20.32	 Jehoshaphat carefully followed the example his father Asa had set and did what the L
2CH.20.33	 But the illegal worship sites on the hills were not torn down. The people still didn’t have their hearts set on the God of their ancestors.
2CH.20.34	 Everything else about Jehoshaphat from first to last is written in the records of Jehu, son of Hanani, which is included in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
2CH.20.35	 After this, King Jehoshaphat of Judah allied himself with King Ahaziah of Israel, who led him to do evil. 
2CH.20.36	 Jehoshaphat joined him in making ships to go to Tarshish. They made the ships in Ezion Geber. 
2CH.20.37	 Then Eliezer, son of Dodavahu from Mareshah, prophesied against Jehoshaphat. He said, “The L
2CH.21.1	 Jehoshaphat lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. His son Jehoram succeeded him as king. 
2CH.21.2	 He had the following brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. All were the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Israel. 
2CH.21.3	 Their father gave them many gifts: silver, gold, and other expensive things, along with fortified cities in Judah. But Jehoshaphat gave the kingdom to Jehoram, who was the firstborn.
2CH.21.4	 After Jehoram had taken over his father’s kingdom, he strengthened his position and then executed all his brothers and some of the officials of Israel. 
2CH.21.5	 Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king, and he ruled for 8 years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.21.6	 He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as Ahab’s family had done, because his wife was Ahab’s daughter. So he did what the L
2CH.21.7	 But the L
2CH.21.8	 During Jehoram’s time Edom rebelled against Judah and chose its own king. 
2CH.21.9	 Jehoram took all his chariot commanders to attack. The Edomites and their chariot commanders surrounded him, but he got up at night and broke through their lines. 
2CH.21.10	 So Edom rebelled against Judah’s rule and is still independent today. At the same time Edom rebelled, Libnah rebelled because Jehoram had abandoned the L
2CH.21.11	 Jehoram made illegal places of worship in the hills of Judah. This caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to chase after foreign gods as if they were prostitutes. So he led Judah astray.
2CH.21.12	 Then a letter came to him from the prophet Elijah. It read, “This is what the L
2CH.21.13	 Instead, you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel. You, like Ahab’s family, have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to chase after foreign gods as if they were prostitutes. You have killed your brothers, your father’s family. Your brothers were better than you. 
2CH.21.14	 The L
2CH.21.15	 You will suffer from a chronic intestinal disease until your intestines come out.”
2CH.21.16	 The L
2CH.21.17	 They fought against Judah, broke into the country, and took away everything that could be found in the royal palace. They even took Jehoram’s sons and wives. The only son left was Ahaziah,
2CH.21.18	 After this, the L
2CH.21.19	 Two years later, as his life was coming to an end, his intestines fell out because of his sickness. He died a painful death.
2CH.21.19	His people did not make a bonfire in his honor as they had done for his ancestors. 
2CH.21.20	 He was 32 years old when he became king, and he ruled for 8 years in Jerusalem. No one was sorry to see him die. He was buried in the City of David but not in the tombs of the kings.
2CH.22.1	 The people of Jerusalem made Jehoram’s youngest son Ahaziah king in his place, because the raiders who came to the camp with the Arabs had killed all the older sons. So Jehoram’s son Ahaziah became king of Judah. 
2CH.22.2	 Ahaziah 
2CH.22.3	 Ahaziah also followed the ways of Ahab’s family, because his mother gave him advice that led him to sin. 
2CH.22.4	 He did what the L
2CH.22.5	 Ahaziah followed their advice and went with Ahab’s son King Joram 
2CH.22.6	 Joram returned to Jezreel to let his wounds heal. (He had been wounded by the Arameans at Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Aram.) Then Jehoram’s son Ahaziah 
2CH.22.7	 God brought about Ahaziah’s downfall when he went to Joram. He went with Joram to meet Jehu, grandson of Nimshi. (The L
2CH.22.8	 When Jehu was executing judgment on Ahab’s family, he found Judah’s leaders (Ahaziah’s nephews) who were serving Ahaziah, and he killed them. 
2CH.22.9	 He searched for Ahaziah, and Jehu’s men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. They brought him to Jehu and killed him. Then they buried him. They explained, “Ahaziah is Jehoshaphat’s grandson. Jehoshaphat dedicated his life to serving the L
2CH.22.10	 When Ahaziah’s mother, Athaliah, saw that her son was dead, she began to destroy the entire royal family of the house of Judah. 
2CH.22.11	 But Jehoshebath, daughter of the king and sister of Ahaziah, took Ahaziah’s son Joash. She saved him from being killed with the king’s other sons, and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Jehoshebath was the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the priest. Because she was also Ahaziah’s sister, she hid Joash from Athaliah. So he wasn’t killed. 
2CH.22.12	 Joash was with the priests. He was hidden in God’s temple for six years while Athaliah ruled the country.
2CH.23.1	 In the seventh year of Athaliah’s reign, Jehoiada strengthened his position by making an agreement with the company commanders: Azariah, son of Jeroham, Ishmael, son of Jehohanan, Azariah, son of Obed, Maaseiah, son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat, son of Zichri. 
2CH.23.2	 They went around Judah, gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the leaders of the families of Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.23.3	 The whole assembly made an agreement with the king in God’s temple.
2CH.23.3	Then Jehoiada said to them, “Here is the king’s son. He should be king, as the L
2CH.23.4	 This is what you must do: One third of you, the priests and Levites who are on duty on the day of worship, must guard the gates. 
2CH.23.5	 Another third must be at the royal palace. And another third must be at Foundation Gate. All the people must be in the courtyards of the L
2CH.23.6	 No one should come into the L
2CH.23.7	 The Levites should surround the king. Each man should have his weapon in his hand. Kill anyone who tries to come into the temple. Stay with the king wherever he goes.”
2CH.23.8	 So the Levites and all the Judeans did what the priest Jehoiada had ordered them. Each took his men who were coming on duty on the day of worship as well as those who were about to go off duty. Jehoiada had not dismissed the priestly divisions.
2CH.23.9	 Jehoiada gave the commanders the spears and the small and large shields that had belonged to King David but were now in God’s temple. 
2CH.23.10	 All the troops stood with their weapons drawn. They were stationed around the king and around the altar and the temple (from the south side to the north side of the temple). 
2CH.23.11	 Then they brought out the king’s son, gave him the crown and the religious instructions, and Jehoiada and his sons made him king by anointing him. They said, “Long live the king!”
2CH.23.12	 When Athaliah heard the people running and praising the king, she went into the L
2CH.23.13	 She looked, and the king was standing by the pillar at the entrance. The commanders and the trumpeters were by his side. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. The singers were leading the celebration with songs accompanied by musical instruments. As Athaliah tore her clothes ⌊in distress⌋, she said, “Treason, treason!”
2CH.23.14	 Then the priest Jehoiada brought the company commanders who were in charge of the army out ⌊of the temple⌋. He said to them, “Take her out of the temple. Use your sword to kill anyone who follows her.” (The priest had said, “Don’t kill her in the L
2CH.23.15	 So they arrested her as she entered Horse Gate of the royal palace, and they killed her there.
2CH.23.16	 Jehoiada made a promise to the L
2CH.23.17	 Then all the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed Baal’s altars and his statues and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.
2CH.23.18	 Next, Jehoiada appointed officials to be in charge of the L
2CH.23.19	 Jehoiada appointed gatekeepers for the gates of the L
2CH.23.20	 He took the company commanders, the nobles, the people’s governors, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king from the L
2CH.23.21	 all the people of the land were celebrating. But the city was quiet because they had killed Athaliah with a sword.
2CH.24.1	 Joash 
2CH.24.2	 Joash did what the L
2CH.24.3	 Jehoiada got Joash two wives, and Joash had sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	 After this, Joash wanted to renovate the L
2CH.24.5	 He gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them, “Go to the cities of Judah, and collect money throughout Israel to repair the temple of your God every year. Do it immediately!” But the Levites didn’t do it immediately.
2CH.24.6	 So the king called for the chief priest Jehoiada and asked him, “Why didn’t you require the Levites to bring the contributions from Judah and Jerusalem? The L
2CH.24.7	 (The sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into God’s temple and used all the holy things of the L
2CH.24.8	 The king issued an order, and they made a box and placed it outside the gate of the L
2CH.24.9	 Then they issued a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem that the contributions should be brought to the L
2CH.24.10	 All the officials and all the people were overjoyed. They brought the money and dropped it into the box until it was full. 
2CH.24.11	 Whenever the Levites brought the box to the king’s officers and they saw a lot of money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer would empty the box and put it back in its place. They would do this every day, so they collected a lot of money. 
2CH.24.12	 The king and Jehoiada would give the money to the foremen who were working on the L
2CH.24.13	 As the men worked, the project progressed under the foremen’s guidance. They restored God’s temple to its proper condition and reinforced it.
2CH.24.14	 When they finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, who used it to make utensils for the L
2CH.24.15	 When Jehoiada was old and had lived out his years, he died. He was 130 years old when he died. 
2CH.24.16	 He was buried in the City of David with the kings because of the good he had done in Israel for God and the temple.
2CH.24.17	 After he died, the officials of Judah bowed in front of the king with their faces touching the ground. Then the king listened to their advice. 
2CH.24.18	 They abandoned the temple of the L
2CH.24.19	 The L
2CH.24.20	 God’s Spirit gave Zechariah, son of the priest Jehoiada, strength. Zechariah stood in front of the people and said to them, “This is what God says: Why are you breaking the L
2CH.24.21	 But they plotted against Zechariah, and by the king’s order they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the L
2CH.24.22	 King Joash did not remember how kind Zechariah’s father, Jehoiada, had been to him. Instead, he killed Jehoiada’s son. As Zechariah died, he said, “May the L
2CH.24.23	 At the end of the year, the Aramean army attacked Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the people’s leaders. The Arameans sent all the loot they took from Judah and Jerusalem to the king of Damascus. 
2CH.24.24	 The Aramean army had come with a small number of men, but the L
2CH.24.25	 When the Arameans withdrew, they left him suffering from many wounds. His own officials plotted against him for murdering the son of the priest Jehoiada. They killed Joash in his bed. When he died, they buried him in the City of David, but they didn’t bury him in the tombs of the kings. 
2CH.24.26	 These were the men who conspired against him: Zabad, son of an Ammon ite woman named Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of a Moabite woman named Shimrith. 
2CH.24.27	 The record about his sons, the many divine revelations against him, and the rebuilding of God’s temple is in the notes made in the Book of the Kings. His son Amaziah succeeded him as king.
2CH.25.1	 Amaziah was 25 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddan from Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	 He did what the L
2CH.25.3	 As soon as he had firm control over the kingdom, he executed the officials who killed his father, the former king. 
2CH.25.4	 But he didn’t execute their children. He obeyed the L
2CH.25.5	 Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them by families to regiment and battalion commanders for all of Judah and Benjamin. He organized those who were at least 20 years old and found that he had 300,000 of the best men for the army, those who could handle a spear and a shield. 
2CH.25.6	 He also hired 100,000 soldiers from Israel for 7,500 pounds of silver.
2CH.25.7	 But a man of God came to him and said, “Your Majesty, Israel’s army must not go with you, because the L
2CH.25.8	 If you go into battle with them, no matter how courageous you are, God will use the enemy to defeat you, because God has the power to help you or to defeat you.”
2CH.25.9	 Amaziah asked the man of God, “What should I do about the 7,500 pounds of silver I gave the troops from Israel?”
2CH.25.9	The man of God answered, “The L
2CH.25.10	 Then Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim. But they became furious with Judah and returned home.
2CH.25.11	 Amaziah courageously led his troops. When he came to the Dead Sea region, he killed 10,000 men from Seir.
2CH.25.12	 The Judeans captured another 10,000 alive, took them to the top of a cliff, and threw them off the top of the cliff so that they were dismembered.
2CH.25.13	 The troops that Amaziah sent back so that they couldn’t go with him into battle raided the towns in Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed 3,000 people and took a lot of goods.
2CH.25.14	 After Amaziah came back from defeating the Edomites, he brought the gods of the people of Seir, set them up as his gods, bowed down to them, and burned sacrifices to them. 
2CH.25.15	 The L
2CH.25.16	 As he was talking, the king asked him, “Did we make you an adviser to the king? Stop! Do you want me to have you killed?”
2CH.25.16	The prophet stopped. He said, “I know that God has decided to destroy you because you did this, but you refuse to listen to my advice.”
2CH.25.17	 After getting advice ⌊from his advisers⌋, King Amaziah of Judah sent messengers to King Jehoash,
2CH.25.18	 King Jehoash of Israel sent this message to King Amaziah of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon. It said, ‘Let your daughter marry my son,’ but a wild animal from Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle. 
2CH.25.19	 You say you defeated Edom, and now you’ve become arrogant enough to look for more fame. Stay home! Why must you invite disaster and your own defeat and take Judah with you?”
2CH.25.20	 But Amaziah wouldn’t listen. (God made this happen because he wanted to hand over the Judeans to Jehoash because they had sought help from Edom’s gods.) 
2CH.25.21	 So King Jehoash of Israel attacked, and King Amaziah of Judah met him in battle at Beth Shemesh in Judah. 
2CH.25.22	 Israel defeated the army of Judah, and the Judeans fled to their homes. 
2CH.25.23	 King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah, son of Joash and grandson of Ahaziah of Judah, at Beth Shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem. He tore down a 600-foot section of the wall around Jerusalem from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate. 
2CH.25.24	 ⌊He took⌋ all the gold, silver, and all the utensils he found in God’s temple with Obed Edom and in the royal palace treasury. He also took hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.25	 Joash’s son King Amaziah of Judah lived 15 years after the death of Jehoahaz’s son King Jehoash of Israel. 
2CH.25.26	 Isn’t everything else about Amaziah, from beginning to end, written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel? 
2CH.25.27	 After Amaziah turned away from the L
2CH.25.28	 They brought him back by horse and buried him in the city of Judah with his ancestors.
2CH.26.1	 All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was 16 years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. 
2CH.26.2	 Uzziah rebuilt Elath and returned it to Judah after King Amaziah lay down in death with his ancestors. 
2CH.26.3	 Uzziah was 16 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jecoliah from Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	 He did what the L
2CH.26.5	 He dedicated his life to serving God in the days of Zechariah, who taught him to fear God. As long as he dedicated his life to serving the L
2CH.26.6	 Uzziah went to wage war against the Philistines. He tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. He built cities near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. 
2CH.26.7	 God helped him when he attacked the Philistines, the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunites. 
2CH.26.8	 The Ammonites paid taxes to Uzziah, and his fame spread to the border of Egypt because he became very powerful. 
2CH.26.9	 Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at Corner Wall, Valley Gate, and the Angle, and he reinforced them. 
2CH.26.10	 He built towers in the desert. He dug many cisterns because he had a lot of herds in the foothills and the plains. He had farmers and vineyard workers in the mountains and the fertile fields because he loved the soil.
2CH.26.11	 Uzziah had an army of professional soldiers. They were ready to go to war in their companies based on the number organized by the scribe Jeiel and the officer Maaseiah. They were commanded by Hananiah, one of the king’s officials. 
2CH.26.12	 The total number of family heads among these warriors was 2,600. 
2CH.26.13	 Under them was an army of 307,500 soldiers. They were a powerful force that could support the king against the enemy. 
2CH.26.14	 For the entire army Uzziah prepared shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and stones for slings. 
2CH.26.15	 In Jerusalem he made machines designed by inventive people. The machines were placed on the towers and corners to shoot arrows and hurl large stones.
2CH.26.15	Uzziah’s fame spread far and wide because he had strong support until he became powerful. 
2CH.26.16	 But when he became powerful, his pride destroyed him. He was unfaithful to the L
2CH.26.17	 The priest Azariah went in after him with 80 of the L

2CH.26.20	 When the chief priest Azariah and all the priests turned toward him, a skin disease was on his forehead. They rushed him away. Uzziah was in a hurry to get out because the L

2CH.26.22	 Everything else about Uzziah, from beginning to end, is recorded by the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz. 
2CH.26.23	 Uzziah lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried with them in a field containing tombs that belonged to the kings. People said, “He had a skin disease.” His son Jotham succeeded him as king.
2CH.27.1	 Jotham was 25 years old when he began to rule. He ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jerushah, daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	 He did what the L
2CH.27.3	 Jotham built the Upper Gate of the L
2CH.27.4	 He built cities in the hills of Judah, and he built forts and towers in the wooded areas. 
2CH.27.5	 He fought with the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. That year the Ammonites gave him 7,500 pounds of silver, 60,000 bushels of wheat, and 60,000 bushels of barley. The Ammonites gave him the same amount for two more years. 
2CH.27.6	 Jotham grew powerful because he was determined to live as the L
2CH.27.7	 Everything else about Jotham—all his wars and his life—is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	 He was 25 years old when he began to rule as king. He ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	 Jotham lay down in death with his ancestors, and they buried him in the City of David. His son Ahaz succeeded him as king.
2CH.28.1	 Ahaz was 20 years old when he began to rule. He ruled for 26 years in Jerusalem. He didn’t do what the L
2CH.28.2	 He followed the example of the kings of Israel and even made metal idols for worshiping other gods—the Baals. 
2CH.28.3	 He burned sacrifices in the valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his son by burning him alive, one of the disgusting things done by the nations that the L
2CH.28.4	 He offered sacrifices and burned incense as an offering at the illegal worship sites, which were on hills and under every large tree.
2CH.28.5	 So the L
2CH.28.6	 In one day Pekah, son of Remaliah, killed 120,000 soldiers in Judah because they had abandoned the L
2CH.28.7	 Zichri, a fighting man from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah, who was the king’s son, Azrikam, who was in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, who was the king’s second-in-command. 
2CH.28.8	 The Israelites captured 200,000 women, boys, and girls from their relatives ⌊the Judeans⌋. They also took a lot of goods from Judah and brought them to Samaria.
2CH.28.9	 A prophet of the L
2CH.28.10	 Now you intend to enslave the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem. But aren’t you also guilty of sinning against the L
2CH.28.11	 Listen to me. Return these prisoners you have captured from your relatives, because the L
2CH.28.12	 Then Azariah, son of Jehohan, Berechiah, son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah, son of Shallum, and Amasa, son of Hadlai (some leaders of Ephraim) opposed those coming home from the army. 
2CH.28.13	 They said to the army, “Don’t bring the prisoners here. You’ll make us responsible for this sin against the L
2CH.28.14	 So the army left the prisoners and the loot in front of the leaders and the whole assembly. 
2CH.28.15	 Then the men who were mentioned by name took charge of the prisoners and gave clothes from the loot to all the prisoners who were naked. They provided clothes for them, gave them sandals, gave them something to eat and drink, and let them bathe. They put everyone who was exhausted on donkeys and brought them to Jericho (the City of Palms) near their own people. Then they returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	 At that time King Ahaz sent for help from the kings of Assyria. 
2CH.28.17	 The Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and captured prisoners. 
2CH.28.18	 The Philistines had raided the foothills and the Negev in Judah. They captured and began living in Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco and its villages, Timnah and its villages, and Gimzo and its villages. 
2CH.28.19	 The L
2CH.28.20	 King Tillegath Pilneser of Assyria attacked Ahaz. Instead of strengthening Ahaz, Tillegath Pilneser made trouble for him. 
2CH.28.21	 Ahaz took some of the things from the L
2CH.28.22	 When he had this trouble, King Ahaz became more unfaithful to the L
2CH.28.23	 He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, the gods who had defeated him. He thought, “The gods of the kings of Aram are helping them. I’ll sacrifice to them so that they will help me.” But they ruined him and all Israel.
2CH.28.24	 Ahaz collected the utensils in God’s temple, cut them up, and closed the doors to the L
2CH.28.25	 And in each city of Judah, he made places of worship to sacrifice to other gods. So he made the L
2CH.28.26	 Everything else about him—everything from beginning to end—is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.28.27	 Ahaz lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the city of Jerusalem because they didn’t put him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah succeeded him as king.
2CH.29.1	 Hezekiah began to rule as king when he was 25 years old. He ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abijah, daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	 He did what the L
2CH.29.3	 In the first month of his first year as king, he opened the doors of the L
2CH.29.4	 He brought the priests and Levites together in the square on the east side ⌊of the temple⌋.
2CH.29.5	 He said to them, “Listen to me, Levites. Perform the ceremonies to make the temple of the L

2CH.29.7	 They also shut the doors of the ⌊temple’s⌋ entrance hall, extinguished the lamps, and didn’t burn incense or sacrifice burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	 So the L
2CH.29.9	 Our fathers were killed in battle, and our sons, daughters, and wives are prisoners because of this. 
2CH.29.10	 Now I intend to make a pledge to the L
2CH.29.11	 Don’t be negligent, my sons. The L
2CH.29.12	 So the Levites started to work.
2CH.29.12	From Kohath’s descendants were Mahath, son of Amasai, and Joel, son of Azariah.
2CH.29.12	From Merari’s descendants were Kish, son of Abdi, and Azariah, son of Jehallelel.
2CH.29.12	From Gershon’s descendants were Joah, son of Zimmah, and Eden, son of Joah.
2CH.29.13	 From Elizaphan’s descendants were Shimri and Jeiel.
2CH.29.13	From Asaph’s descendants were Zechariah and Mattaniah.
2CH.29.14	 From Heman’s descendants were Jehiel and Shimei.
2CH.29.14	From Jeduthun’s descendants were Shemaiah and Uzziel.
2CH.29.15	 These men gathered their relatives and performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy. Then they obeyed the king’s order from the L
2CH.29.16	 The priests entered the L
2CH.29.17	 They started on the first day of the first month. On the eighth day they went into the L
2CH.29.18	 Then they went to King Hezekiah. They said ⌊to him⌋, “We have made all of the L
2CH.29.19	 and all the utensils King Ahaz refused to use during his reign when he was unfaithful. We have restored them and made them holy. They are in front of the L
2CH.29.20	 Early in the morning Hezekiah gathered the leaders of the city and went to the L
2CH.29.21	 They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as an offering for sin for the kingdom, the holy place, and Judah. Hezekiah told the priests, Aaron’s descendants, to sacrifice the animals on the L
2CH.29.22	 So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests sprinkled the blood on the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. After that, they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 
2CH.29.23	 Then they brought the male goats for the offering for sin in front of the king and the assembly, who laid their hands on them. 
2CH.29.24	 The priests slaughtered the goats and made their blood an offering for sin at the altar to make peace with the L
2CH.29.25	 He had the Levites stand in the L
2CH.29.26	 The Levites stood with David’s instruments, and the priests had the trumpets. 
2CH.29.27	 Then Hezekiah ordered the sacrificing of burnt offerings on the altar. When the burnt offerings started, the songs to the L
2CH.29.28	 The whole assembly bowed down with their faces touching the ground, singers began to sing, and the trumpets blew until the burnt offering was finished. 
2CH.29.29	 When the burnt offerings were finished, the king and everyone who was with him kneeled and bowed down. 
2CH.29.30	 Then King Hezekiah and the leaders told the Levites to praise the L
2CH.29.31	 Hezekiah said, “You have dedicated your lives to the L
2CH.29.31	The assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and everyone who was willing brought burnt offerings. 
2CH.29.32	 The burnt offerings brought by the assembly totaled 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs. All of these were burnt offerings to the L
2CH.29.33	 The animals dedicated as holy sacrifices were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep. 
2CH.29.34	 But the priests needed more help to skin all the burnt offerings. So their relatives, the Levites, helped them until the work was completed and the priests could make themselves holy. The Levites were more diligent in making themselves holy than the priests were. 
2CH.29.35	 There were many burnt offerings in addition to the fat of the fellowship offerings and wine offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings. So the worship in the L
2CH.29.36	 Hezekiah and all the people were overjoyed because of what God had done for the people. Everything had happened so quickly.
2CH.30.1	 Hezekiah sent a message to all Israel and Judah and wrote letters to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. He invited them to come to the L
2CH.30.2	 The king, his officials, and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month. 
2CH.30.3	 They couldn’t celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy and the people hadn’t gathered in Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.4	 The king and the whole assembly considered their plan to be the right thing to do. 
2CH.30.5	 So they decided to send an announcement throughout Israel from Beersheba to Dan. They summoned everyone to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the L
2CH.30.6	 Messengers took letters from the king and his officials throughout Israel and Judah. The king’s order said, “Israelites, return to the L
2CH.30.7	 Don’t be like your ancestors and your relatives who were unfaithful to the L
2CH.30.8	 Don’t be impossible to deal with like your ancestors. Reach out for the L
2CH.30.9	 When you return to the L
2CH.30.10	 So the messengers went from city to city in the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun. But the people ridiculed them. 
2CH.30.11	 However, some people from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	 Also, God guided the people of Judah so that they united to carry out the command which the king and the leaders gave from the L
2CH.30.13	 Many people gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month. They formed a large assembly.
2CH.30.14	 Then the people got rid of the ⌊idols’⌋ altars in Jerusalem. They got rid of all the altars for incense by dumping them in the Kidron Valley.
2CH.30.15	 They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed, so they performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy. Then they brought burnt offerings to the L
2CH.30.16	 They stood in their regular places as instructed by Moses’ Teachings. (Moses was a man of God.) The priests sprinkled the blood they received from the Levites. 
2CH.30.17	 Many people in the assembly had not made themselves holy. So the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all who weren’t clean 
2CH.30.18	 Many people from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not made themselves clean. So they ate the Passover, but not in the way the written instructions said they should. Hezekiah prayed for them: “May the good L
2CH.30.19	 those who have their hearts set on dedicating their lives to serving God. May the L
2CH.30.20	 The L
2CH.30.21	 So the Israelites in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. Each day the Levites and priests praised the L
2CH.30.22	 Hezekiah spoke encouraging words to all the Levites who had the skills to serve the L
2CH.30.23	 Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate the festival for seven more days. So they joyfully celebrated for seven more days. 
2CH.30.24	 King Hezekiah of Judah provided 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep as sacrifices for the assembly. The leaders provided 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep for the assembly. So a large number of priests were able to perform the ceremonies to make themselves holy.
2CH.30.25	 The whole assembly from Judah, the priests, the Levites, the whole assembly from Israel, the foreigners who came from Israel, and those who lived in Judah rejoiced. 
2CH.30.26	 The city of Jerusalem was filled with joy. Nothing like this had happened in Jerusalem since the days of King Solomon of Israel.
2CH.30.27	 Then the Levitical priests blessed the people. Their voices were heard, and their prayers went to God’s holy place in heaven.
2CH.31.1	 When this was over, all the Israelites who were there went to the cities in Judah. They crushed the sacred stones, cut down the poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah, and tore down the illegal places of worship and the altars throughout Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. The Israelites destroyed all of these things. Then all the Israelites returned to their own cities. Each person went to his own property.
2CH.31.2	 Hezekiah assigned the priests and the Levites to divisions. Each priest or Levite was put in a division based on the service he performed: sacrificing burnt offerings, sacrificing fellowship offerings, serving, giving thanks, or praising within the gates of the L
2CH.31.3	 He set aside part of the king’s property for burnt offerings, the morning and evening offerings, burnt offerings on the weekly worship days, the New Moon Festivals, and the annual festivals, as it is written in the L
2CH.31.4	 He told the people living in Jerusalem to give the priests and Levites the portions they were due so that they could devote themselves to the L
2CH.31.5	 As soon as the word spread, the Israelites brought plenty of offerings from the first of their produce: grain, new wine, fresh olive oil, honey, and every crop from the fields. They brought large quantities, a tenth of everything. 
2CH.31.6	 The people of Israel and Judah who were living in the cities of Judah brought a tenth of their cattle and sheep and a tenth of the holy things they had dedicated to the L
2CH.31.7	 In the third month they started piling them up, and in the seventh month they finished. 
2CH.31.8	 When Hezekiah and the leaders saw the heaps, they praised the L
2CH.31.9	 Hezekiah asked the priests and the Levites about the heaps. 
2CH.31.10	 The chief priest Azariah from Zadok’s family said, “Since the people started to bring the offerings to the L
2CH.31.11	 Then Hezekiah told them to prepare storerooms in the L
2CH.31.12	 they faithfully brought in the contributions, the offerings of one-tenth of the crops, and the gifts dedicated to God. The Levite Conaniah was in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was his assistant. 
2CH.31.13	 King Hezekiah and Azariah, who was in charge of God’s temple, appointed Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah to serve under Conaniah and his brother Shimei. 
2CH.31.14	 Kore, son of Imnah the Levite, was the gatekeeper at East Gate and had to take care of the freewill offerings made to God. His responsibility was to distribute the offerings made to the L
2CH.31.15	 Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah served under him in the cities belonging to the priests. They were to distribute the offerings faithfully to all their relatives, young and old, by their divisions. 
2CH.31.16	 They were appointed to distribute them to males who were at least three years old. The way they were enrolled in the genealogical records did not matter. The six men who served under Kore were to distribute the offerings to everyone who went to the L
2CH.31.17	 They were to distribute offerings to the priests who were enrolled by families and to the Levites who were at least 20 years old. Distribution was based on the way they served in their divisions. 
2CH.31.18	 The priests and Levites were enrolled with their wives, sons, daughters, and other people who depended on them—the whole community. The priests and Levites had to be faithful in keeping themselves holy for the holy work. 
2CH.31.19	 Men were appointed to give a portion of the offerings to all the males in the priestly families and to everyone listed in the genealogies of the Levites. These men were Aaron’s descendants, priests who lived in the pasturelands of every Levite city.
2CH.31.20	 This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He did what was good and right and true to the L
2CH.31.21	 Hezekiah incorporated Moses’ Teachings and commands into worship and dedicated his life to serving God. Whatever he did for the worship in God’s temple, he did wholeheartedly, and he succeeded.
2CH.32.1	 After everything Hezekiah had done so faithfully, King Sennacherib of Assyria came to invade Judah. He set up camp ⌊to attack⌋ the fortified cities. He intended to conquer them himself.
2CH.32.2	 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come to wage war against Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	 he, his officers, and his military staff made plans to stop the water from flowing out of the springs outside the city. They helped him do it. 
2CH.32.4	 A large crowd gathered as they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land. They said, “Why should the kings of Assyria find plenty of water?”
2CH.32.5	 Hezekiah worked hard. He rebuilt all the broken sections of the wall, made the towers taller, built another wall outside ⌊the city wall⌋, strengthened the Millo 
2CH.32.6	 He appointed military commanders over the troops and gathered the commanders in the square by the city gate. He spoke these words of encouragement: 
2CH.32.7	 “Be strong and courageous. Don’t be frightened or terrified by the king of Assyria or the crowd with him. Someone greater is on our side. 
2CH.32.8	 The king of Assyria has human power on his side, but the L
2CH.32.9	 After this, while King Sennacherib of Assyria and all his royal forces were attacking Lachish, he sent his officers to King Hezekiah of Judah and to all of the people in Judah who were in Jerusalem to say: 
2CH.32.10	 “This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says: Why are you so confident as you live in Jerusalem while it is blockaded? 
2CH.32.11	 Isn’t Hezekiah misleading you and abandoning you to die from hunger and thirst when he says, ‘The L
2CH.32.12	 Isn’t this the same Hezekiah who got rid of the L
2CH.32.13	 Don’t you know what I and my predecessors have done to the people of all other countries? Were any of the gods of these other nations ever able to rescue their countries from me? 
2CH.32.14	 Were the gods of these nations able to rescue their people from my control? My predecessors claimed and destroyed those nations. Is your God able to rescue you from my control? 
2CH.32.15	 Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you like this. Don’t believe him. No god of any nation or kingdom could save his people from me or my ancestors. Certainly, your God will not rescue you from me!”
2CH.32.16	 Sennacherib’s officers said more against the L
2CH.32.17	 Sennacherib wrote letters cursing the L
2CH.32.18	 Sennacherib’s officers shouted loudly in the Judean language to the troops who were on the wall of Jerusalem. They tried to frighten and terrify the troops so that they could capture the city. 
2CH.32.19	 They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as if he were one of the gods made by human hands and worshiped by the people in other countries.
2CH.32.20	 Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, prayed about this and called to heaven. 
2CH.32.21	 The L
2CH.32.22	 So the L
2CH.32.23	 Many people still went to Jerusalem to bring gifts to the L
2CH.32.24	 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was about to die. He prayed to the L
2CH.32.25	 But Hezekiah was conceited, so he didn’t repay the L
2CH.32.26	 Hezekiah and the people living in Jerusalem humbled themselves when they realized they had become conceited. So the L
2CH.32.27	 Hezekiah became richer and was highly honored. He prepared storerooms for himself to hold silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuables. 
2CH.32.28	 He made sheds to store his harvests of grain, new wine, and fresh olive oil, and he made barns for all his cattle and stalls for his flocks. 
2CH.32.29	 He made cities for himself because he had many sheep and cattle. God had given him a lot of property. 
2CH.32.30	 Hezekiah was the one who stopped the water from flowing from the upper outlet of Gihon. He channeled the water directly underground to the west side of the City of David. Hezekiah succeeded in everything he did.
2CH.32.31	 When the leaders of Babylon sent ambassadors to ask him about the miraculous sign that had happened in the land, God left him. God did this to test him, to find out everything that was in Hezekiah’s heart.
2CH.32.32	 Everything else about Hezekiah, including his devotion to God, is written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, and in the records of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.32.33	 Hezekiah lay down in death with his ancestors. He was buried in the upper tombs of David’s descendants. When Hezekiah died, all of Judah and the people in Jerusalem honored him. His son Manasseh succeeded him as king.
2CH.33.1	 Manasseh was 12 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for 55 years in Jerusalem.
2CH.33.2	 He did what the L
2CH.33.3	 He rebuilt the illegal places of worship that his father Hezekiah had torn down. He set up altars dedicated to other gods—the Baals—and made a pole dedicated to the goddess Asherah as King Ahab of Israel had done. Manasseh, like Ahab, worshiped and served the entire army of heaven. 
2CH.33.4	 He built altars in the L
2CH.33.5	 In the two courtyards of the L

2CH.33.8	 I will never again remove Israel from the land that I set aside for their ancestors if they will obey all the commands, all the teachings, the ordinances, and the regulations ⌊I gave⌋ through Moses.” 
2CH.33.9	 Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that they did more evil things than the nations that the L

2CH.33.14	 After this, Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David from west of Gihon Spring in the valley to the entrance of Fish Gate. He made the wall go around the Ophel, and he built it very high. He put army commanders in every fortified city in Judah.
2CH.33.15	 Manasseh got rid of the foreign gods and the idol in the L
2CH.33.16	 He built the L
2CH.33.17	 The people continued to sacrifice at the illegal places of worship, but they sacrificed only to the L
2CH.33.18	 Everything else about Manasseh—including his prayer to his God and the words that the seers 
2CH.33.19	 His prayer and how God accepted it are written in the records of Hozai. The things he did before he humbled himself are also written there. This includes all his sins and unfaithfulness and the places where he built illegal worship sites and set up idols and poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah.
2CH.33.20	 Manasseh lay down in death with his ancestors. They buried him in his own palace. His son Amon succeeded him as king.
2CH.33.21	 Amon was 22 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for 2 years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.22	 He did what the L
2CH.33.23	 He didn’t humble himself in front of the L
2CH.33.24	 His officials plotted against him and killed him in his palace. 
2CH.33.25	 Then the people of the land killed everyone who had plotted against King Amon. They made his son Josiah king in his place.
2CH.34.1	 Josiah was 8 years old when he began to rule, and he was king for 31 years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.2	 He did what the L
2CH.34.3	 In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a boy, he began to dedicate his life to serving the God of his ancestor David. In his twelfth year as king, he began to make Judah and Jerusalem clean 
2CH.34.4	 He had the altars of the various Baal gods torn down. He cut down the incense altars that were above them. He destroyed the Asherah poles, carved idols, and metal idols. He ground them into powder and scattered the powder over the tombs of those who had sacrificed to them. 
2CH.34.5	 He burned the bones of the priests on their altars. So he made Judah and Jerusalem clean. 
2CH.34.6	 In the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, he removed all their temples,
2CH.34.7	 tore down the altars, beat the Asherah poles and idols into powder, and cut down all the incense altars everywhere in Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	 In the eighteenth year of his reign as he was making the land and the temple clean, Josiah sent Shaphan, son of Azaliah, Maaseiah, the mayor of the city, and Joah, the royal historian and son of Joahaz, to repair the temple of the L
2CH.34.9	 They came to the chief priest Hilkiah and gave him the money that had been brought to God’s temple, the money that the Levite doorkeepers had collected from the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, from all who were left in Israel, from everyone in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.10	 They gave the money to the foremen who were in charge of the L
2CH.34.11	 (These workers included carpenters and builders.) They were to buy quarried stones and wood for the fittings and beams of the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to become run-down. 
2CH.34.12	 The men did their work faithfully under the supervision of Jahath and Obadiah (Levites descended from Merari), and Zechariah and Meshullam (descendants of Kohath). The Levites, who were skilled musicians, 
2CH.34.13	 also supervised the workers and directed all the workmen on the various jobs. Some of the Levites served as scribes, officials, or gatekeepers.
2CH.34.14	 When they brought out the money that had been deposited in the L
2CH.34.15	 Hilkiah told the scribe Shaphan, “I have found the Book of the Teachings in the L
2CH.34.16	 Shaphan took the book to the king and reported, “We are doing everything you told us to do. 
2CH.34.17	 We took the money that was donated in the L
2CH.34.18	 Then the scribe Shaphan told the king, “The priest Hilkiah has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it to the king.
2CH.34.19	 When the king heard what the Teachings said, he tore his clothes ⌊in distress⌋. 
2CH.34.20	 Then the king gave an order to Hilkiah, Ahikam (son of Shaphan), Abdon (son of Micah), the scribe Shaphan, and the royal official Asaiah. He said, 
2CH.34.21	 “On behalf of those who are left in Israel and Judah and me, ask the L
2CH.34.22	 So Hilkiah and the king’s officials went to talk to the prophet Huldah about this matter. She was the wife of Shallum, son of Tokhath and grandson of Hasrah. Shallum was in charge of the ⌊royal⌋ wardrobe. Huldah was living in the Second Part of Jerusalem.
2CH.34.23	 She told them, “This is what the L
2CH.34.24	 ‘This is what the L
2CH.34.25	 I will do this because they have abandoned me and sacrificed to other gods in order to make me furious. Therefore, my anger will be poured on this place and will never come to an end.’ ”
2CH.34.26	 ⌊Huldah added,⌋ “Tell Judah’s king who sent you to me to ask the L
2CH.34.27	 You had a change of heart and humbled yourself in front of God when you heard my words against this place and those who live here. You humbled yourself, tore your clothes ⌊in distress⌋, and cried in front of me. So I will listen ⌊to you⌋, declares the L
2CH.34.28	 That is why I’m going to bring you to your ancestors. I’m going to bring you to your grave in peace, and your eyes will not see any of the disaster I’m going to bring on this place and those who live here.’”
2CH.34.28	So they reported this to the king.
2CH.34.29	 Then the king sent for all the respected leaders of Judah and Jerusalem to join him. 
2CH.34.30	 The king, everyone in Judah, everyone living in Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and all the people (young and old) went up to the L
2CH.34.31	 The king stood in his place and made a promise to the L
2CH.34.32	 He also made all those found in Jerusalem and Benjamin join with him ⌊in the promise⌋. Then the people of Jerusalem lived according to the promise of God, the God of their ancestors.
2CH.34.33	 Josiah got rid of all the disgusting idols throughout Israelite territory. He made all people found in Israel serve the L
2CH.35.1	 Josiah celebrated the Passover for the L
2CH.35.2	 Josiah appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them to serve in the L
2CH.35.3	 He told the Levites, who instructed all Israel and performed ceremonies to make themselves holy to the L
2CH.35.4	 Get yourselves ready with the family groups of your divisions, which are listed in the records of King David of Israel and the records of his son Solomon. 
2CH.35.5	 Stand in the holy place representing the family divisions of your relatives, the people ⌊of Israel⌋. Let the Levites be considered a part of each family.
2CH.35.6	 Slaughter the Passover lamb, perform the ceremonies to make yourselves holy, and prepare ⌊the lambs⌋ for the other Israelites as the L
2CH.35.7	 Josiah provided the people with 33,000 sheep and goats to be sacrificed as Passover offerings for all who were present. In addition, he provided 3,000 bulls. (These animals were the king’s property.) 
2CH.35.8	 His officials also voluntarily gave animals to the people, priests, and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the men in charge of God’s temple, gave the priests 2,600 sheep and goats and 300 bulls for Passover sacrifices. 
2CH.35.9	 Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, gave the Levites 5,000 sheep and goats and 500 bulls as Passover sacrifices.
2CH.35.10	 So the service was prepared. The priests took their positions with the Levites according to their divisions, as the king had ordered. 
2CH.35.11	 They slaughtered the Passover lambs. The priests sprinkled the blood with their hands while the Levites skinned the lambs. 
2CH.35.12	 They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the laypeople according to their family divisions. The laypeople could then present them to the L
2CH.35.13	 They roasted the Passover lambs according to the directions. They boiled the holy offerings in pots, kettles, and pans and immediately served them to all the people. 
2CH.35.14	 Later, they prepared ⌊the animals⌋ for themselves and for the priests because the priests (Aaron’s descendants) were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat until that evening.
2CH.35.14	So the Levites prepared ⌊the animals⌋ for themselves and the priests. 
2CH.35.15	 The singers (Asaph’s descendants) were in their places as David, Asaph, Heman, and the king’s seer 
2CH.35.16	 So everything was arranged that day for the worship of the L
2CH.35.17	 The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time. They also celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
2CH.35.18	 Never had a Passover like this been celebrated in Israel during the time of the prophet Samuel or the kings of Israel. They did not celebrate the Passover as Josiah celebrated it with priests, Levites, all of Judah, the people of Israel who could be found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	 In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, this Passover was celebrated.
2CH.35.20	 After all this, when Josiah had repaired the temple, King Neco of Egypt came to fight a battle at Carchemish at the Euphrates River. Josiah went to attack him. 
2CH.35.21	 But Neco sent messengers to Josiah to say, “What’s your quarrel with me, king of Judah? I’m not attacking you. I’ve come to fight those who are at war with me. God told me to hurry. God is with me, so stop now or else he will destroy you.”
2CH.35.22	 But Josiah would not stop his attack. He disguised himself as he went into battle. He refused to listen to Neco’s words, which came from God, and he went to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
2CH.35.23	 Some archers shot King Josiah. The king told his officers, “Take me away because I’m badly wounded.”
2CH.35.24	 His officers took him out of the chariot and brought him to Jerusalem in his other chariot. He died and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 
2CH.35.25	 Jeremiah sang a funeral song about Josiah. All the male and female singers still sing funeral songs about Josiah today. This became a tradition in Israel. They are written in ⌊the Book of⌋ the Funeral Songs.
2CH.35.26	 Everything else about Josiah—including his devotion to God by following what is written in the L
2CH.35.27	 and his acts from first to last—are written in the records of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.1	 Then people of the land took Josiah’s son Jehoahaz and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father. 
2CH.36.2	 Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king, and he was king in Jerusalem for 3 months. 
2CH.36.3	 The king of Egypt removed him from office in Jerusalem and fined the country 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold. 
2CH.36.4	 The king of Egypt made Jehoahaz’s brother Eliakim king of Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Jehoahaz away to Egypt.
2CH.36.5	 Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. He did what the L
2CH.36.6	 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked Jehoiakim and put him in bronze shackles to take him to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	 Nebuchadnezzar also brought some of the utensils of the L
2CH.36.8	 Everything else about Jehoiakim—the disgusting things he did and all the charges against him—is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. His son Jehoiakin succeeded him as king.
2CH.36.9	 Jehoiakin was eight years old when he began to rule as king. He was king for three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what the L

2CH.36.12	 He did what the L

2CH.36.14	 All the officials, the priests, and the people became increasingly unfaithful and followed all the disgusting practices of the nations. Although the L

2CH.36.19	 They burned God’s temple, tore down Jerusalem’s walls, burned down all its palaces, and destroyed everything of value. 
2CH.36.20	 The king of Babylon took those who weren’t executed to Babylon to be slaves for him and his sons. They remained captives until the Persian Empire began to rule. 
2CH.36.21	 This happened so that the L

EZR.1.4	 All who ⌊choose to⌋ remain behind, wherever they may be living, should provide the people who are leaving with silver, gold, supplies, livestock, and freewill offerings to be used in God’s temple in Jerusalem.
EZR.1.5	 Then the heads of the families of Judah and Benjamin, the priests, and the Levites—everyone God had inspired—came forward to rebuild the L
EZR.1.6	 All their neighbors ⌊who were remaining behind⌋ provided them with articles made from silver and gold, supplies, livestock, and valuable gifts besides everything that was freely offered. 
EZR.1.7	 King Cyrus brought out the utensils belonging to the L
EZR.1.8	 King Cyrus of Persia put the treasurer Mithredath in charge of bringing them out. So Mithredath made a list of them for Prince Sheshbazzar of Judah.
EZR.1.9	 This is the inventory:
EZR.1.9	gold dishes 
EZR.1.9	silver dishes—1,000
EZR.1.9	knives 
EZR.1.10	 gold bowls—30
EZR.1.10	other silver bowls—410
EZR.1.10	other utensils—1,000
EZR.1.11	 The gold and silver utensils totaled 5,400.
EZR.1.11	Sheshbazzar took all these utensils with him when the exiles left Babylon to go to Jerusalem.
EZR.2.1	 These were the people in the province. They were the ones who left the place where the exiles had been taken captive. (King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had taken them to Babylon.) These exiles returned to Jerusalem and Judah. All of them went to their own cities. 
EZR.2.2	 They went with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah.
EZR.2.2	This is the number of Israelite men from the people in exile:

EZR.2.55	 These descendants of Solomon’s servants returned from exile: the descendants of Sotai, Hassophereth, Peruda, 
EZR.2.56	 Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel, 
EZR.2.57	 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth Hazzebaim, and Ami.
EZR.2.58	 The temple servants and the descendants of Solomon’s servants totaled 392.
EZR.2.59	 The following people came from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but they couldn’t prove they were Israelites on the basis of their father’s family or their genealogy: 
EZR.2.60	 the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda. These people totaled 652.
EZR.2.61	 These descendants of the priests ⌊couldn’t prove their families were Israelites⌋: the descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai (who had married one of the daughters of Barzillai from Gilead and took that ⌊family⌋ name). 
EZR.2.62	 These people searched for their ⌊family⌋ names in the genealogical records, but their names couldn’t be found there. For this reason they were considered contaminated and couldn’t be priests. 
EZR.2.63	 The governor told them not to eat any of the most holy food until a priest could use the Urim and Thummim 
EZR.2.64	 The whole assembly totaled 42,360. 
EZR.2.65	 In addition to the male and female servants who numbered 7,337, they also had 200 male and female singers. 
EZR.2.66	 They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 
EZR.2.67	 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
EZR.2.68	 When some of the heads of the families came to the L
EZR.2.69	 They contributed as much as they could to the treasury for this work: 1,030 pounds of gold, 5,740 pounds of silver, and 100 robes for the priests.
EZR.2.70	 The priests, the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants settled in their own cities. All the other Israelites settled in their own cities.
EZR.3.1	 When the seventh month came, the people gathered together in Jerusalem. (The Israelites had already settled in their cities.) 
EZR.3.2	 Then Jozadak’s son Jeshua and his relatives ⌊who were⌋ priests and Shealtiel’s son Zerubbabel and his relatives built an altar for the God of Israel. They built it in order to sacrifice burnt offerings. They ⌊followed the directions⌋ written in Moses’ Teachings. (Moses was a man of God). 
EZR.3.3	 So they rebuilt the altar on its original site, though they were afraid of the people in the neighboring regions. They sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the L
EZR.3.4	 Following the written directions, they celebrated the Festival of Booths. Each day they sacrificed the required number of burnt offerings. 
EZR.3.5	 After that, they sacrificed the daily burnt offerings, the offerings for the New Moon Festival and all the other holy festivals of the L
EZR.3.6	 They started to bring these burnt offerings to the L
EZR.3.7	 So they gave money to the stonecutters and carpenters. Then they gave food, drink, and olive oil to the men from Sidon and Tyre in exchange for cedar, which the men would bring by sea from Lebanon to Joppa as King Cyrus of Persia had authorized them to do.
EZR.3.8	 Zerubbabel (who was Shealtiel’s son), Jeshua (who was Jozadak’s son), and the rest of the Jews, (the priests, Levites, and all the others who had come back from exile to Jerusalem) began to rebuild the temple. This happened in the second month of the second year following their return to ⌊the site⌋ of God’s house in Jerusalem. They began by appointing the Levites who were at least 20 years old to direct the work on the L
EZR.3.9	 Then Jeshua with his sons and relatives and Kadmiel with his sons who were Judah’s descendants joined Henadad’s family and their sons and relatives, the Levites, in directing those working on God’s house.
EZR.3.10	 The builders laid the foundation of the L
EZR.3.11	 As they praised and gave thanks to the L
EZR.3.11	“He is good; his mercy toward Israel endures forever.”
EZR.3.11	Then all the people shouted, “Praise the L
EZR.3.12	 But many of the priests, Levites, and the heads of the families who were old enough to have seen the first temple with their own eyes began to sob when they saw the foundation of this temple. Many others shouted for joy. 
EZR.3.13	 No one could distinguish between the joyful shouts and the loud sobbing because the people were shouting so loudly. The noise was heard from far away.
EZR.4.1	 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people who returned from exile were building a temple for the L
EZR.4.2	 they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families. They told them, “We want to help you build because we worship the same God you worship. We have been sacrificing to him 
EZR.4.3	 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of Israel’s families told them, “It isn’t right for your people and our people to build a temple for our God together. We must build it alone for the L
EZR.4.4	 Then the people of that region discouraged the people of Judah and made them afraid to continue building. 
EZR.4.5	 They bribed officials to keep the people of Judah from carrying out their plans throughout the reign of King Cyrus of Persia until the reign of King Darius of Persia.
EZR.4.6	 When Xerxes began to rule, the enemies of Judah and Jerusalem wrote a letter in which they made an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.4.7	 Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their group wrote to him when Artaxerxes was king of Persia. The letter was written with the Aramaic script and translated into the Aramaic language.
EZR.4.8	 Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote another letter against ⌊the people of⌋ Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes. 
EZR.4.9	 At that time, Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe were with the others of their group—the people from Denya, Partakka, Tarpel, Persia, Erech, Babylon, Susa, (that is, those of Elam), 
EZR.4.10	 and the rest of the people whom the great and noble Assurbanipal deported. (Assurbanipal settled them in the cities of Samaria and the rest of the lands west of the Euphrates River.) 
EZR.4.11	 This is the copy of the letter they sent to him:
EZR.4.11	To King Artaxerxes,
EZR.4.11	From your servants, the people west of the Euphrates:
EZR.4.12	 Your Majesty, you should know that the Jews who came to us from you are now in Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are close to finishing the walls. The foundations are already in place. 
EZR.4.13	 You should also know that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, the Jews will no longer pay taxes, fees, and tolls.
EZR.4.13	Ultimately, this will hurt the king’s income. 
EZR.4.14	 Now, because we are paid by your palace, it isn’t right for us to watch something happen that will dishonor the king. So we are sending this letter to inform you 
EZR.4.15	 that you should search the official records of your predecessors. You will find in those official records that this city has been rebellious and has been a threat to kings and provinces. This city has a history of rebelliousness. That’s why this city was destroyed. 
EZR.4.16	 We want the king to know that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, you will have nothing left ⌊of your province⌋ west of the Euphrates River.
EZR.4.17	 Then the king sent this reply:
EZR.4.17	To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their group living in Samaria, and to others west of the Euphrates River:
EZR.4.17	I wish you peace and prosperity!
EZR.4.18	 The letter you sent me has been read word for word in my presence. 
EZR.4.19	 I gave the order, and a search was made. I discovered that this city has a long history of uprisings against kings. Its inhabitants are guilty of treason and rebellion. 
EZR.4.20	 Jerusalem has had powerful kings who have ruled the whole ⌊province⌋ west of the Euphrates. Taxes, fees, and tolls were paid to them. 
EZR.4.21	 So order these men to stop rebuilding. Keep this city from being rebuilt until I give the order. 
EZR.4.22	 Be careful not to neglect your duty in this matter. Why should I, the king, suffer any more harm?
EZR.4.23	 Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and their group hurried to Jerusalem after hearing a copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter. They forced the Jews to stop rebuilding.
EZR.4.24	 Then the work on God’s temple in Jerusalem was stopped. Nothing more was done until Darius’ second year as king of Persia.
EZR.5.1	 The prophet Haggai and Zechariah, grandson of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of Israel’s God, who was over them. 
EZR.5.2	 Then Zerubbabel, who was Shealtiel’s son, and Jeshua, who was Jozadak’s son, began to rebuild God’s temple in Jerusalem. God’s prophets were with them and supported them.
EZR.5.3	 At the same time, Governor Tattenai ⌊from the province⌋ west of the Euphrates River, Shethar Bozenai, and their group went to the Jews and asked them, “Who gave you permission to rebuild this temple and finish its walls?” 
EZR.5.4	 They also asked the Jews for the names of the men who were working on this building.
EZR.5.5	 But the leaders of the Jews were under God’s watchful eye. They couldn’t be stopped until Darius received a report and sent a reply to it.
EZR.5.6	 Here is a copy of the letter Governor Tattenai ⌊from the province⌋ west of the Euphrates River, Shethar Bozenai and his group (the Persians west of that river) sent to King Darius. 
EZR.5.7	 They sent him the following report:
EZR.5.7	To King Darius,
EZR.5.7	We wish you peace and prosperity in everything you do.
EZR.5.8	 Your Majesty should know that we went to the province of Judah, to the temple of the great God. The temple is being built with large stones and with wooden beams laid in its walls. The builders are doing an excellent job and making rapid progress. 
EZR.5.9	 We asked their leaders the following question: “Who gave you permission to rebuild this temple and finish its walls?” 
EZR.5.10	 For your information, we also asked them for their names so that we would have a record of the men who were their leaders. 
EZR.5.11	 This was their reply to us:
EZR.5.11	“We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth. We are rebuilding the temple that was originally built many years ago by a great king of Israel. 
EZR.5.12	 But because our ancestors made the God of heaven angry, he handed them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon (a Chaldean). So Nebuchadnezzar destroyed this temple and deported its people to Babylon.
EZR.5.13	 “However, in the first year of the reign of King Cyrus of Babylon, Cyrus gave permission for God’s temple to be rebuilt. 
EZR.5.14	 In addition, Cyrus took out of a temple in Babylon the gold and silver utensils that belonged to God’s temple. (Nebuchadnezzar had taken them out of God’s temple in Jerusalem and brought them into a temple in Babylon.) Cyrus gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor. 
EZR.5.15	 Cyrus told him, ‘Take these utensils. Place them in the temple in Jerusalem. Rebuild God’s temple on its original site.’ 
EZR.5.16	 Then Sheshbazzar laid the foundation of God’s temple in Jerusalem. The temple has been under construction from that time until now, but it still isn’t finished.”
EZR.5.17	 If it pleases Your Majesty, allow someone to search the king’s archives in Babylon to determine whether King Cyrus gave permission for the temple of God to be rebuilt in Jerusalem. Then please send us Your Majesty’s decision on this matter.
EZR.6.1	 Then King Darius gave the order to search the library where the archives were stored in Babylon. 
EZR.6.2	 A scroll was found in the palace of Ecbatana, which is in the province of Media. This was written on it:
EZR.6.2	MEMORANDUM
EZR.6.3	 Date: Cyrus’ first year as king
EZR.6.3	From: King Cyrus
EZR.6.3	Subject: God’s temple in Jerusalem
EZR.6.3	The temple should be rebuilt as a place to offer sacrifices. Its foundation should be laid. It should be 90 feet high and 90 feet wide 
EZR.6.4	 with three rows of large stones and a row of wood. The king’s palace will pay for it. 
EZR.6.5	 In addition, Cyrus took out of a temple in Babylon the gold and silver utensils that belonged to God’s temple. (Nebuchadnezzar had taken them out of God’s temple in Jerusalem and brought them into a temple in Babylon.) They should be returned to their proper place in the temple in Jerusalem. You should put each one in God’s temple.
EZR.6.6	 Governor Tattenai ⌊from the province⌋ west of the Euphrates, Shethar Bozenai, and those of your group (the Persians west of the river):
EZR.6.6	You must stay away from there. 
EZR.6.7	 Don’t interfere with the work on God’s temple. Let the governor of the Jews and the leaders of Judah rebuild God’s temple on its ⌊original⌋ foundation. 
EZR.6.8	 I am issuing this decree about how you must help the Jewish leaders rebuild God’s temple:
EZR.6.8	The cost ⌊for this⌋ should be paid out of the king’s own money from the taxes ⌊on the province⌋ west of the Euphrates. Full payment should be made to these men so that the work is not interrupted. 
EZR.6.9	 Also, whatever the priests in Jerusalem need for burnt offerings to the God of heaven—young bulls, rams, lambs, wheat, salt, wine, and olive oil—should be provided for them each day. Make sure that nothing is omitted. 
EZR.6.10	 Then they can offer sacrifices that please the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
EZR.6.11	 I am also issuing a decree that if anyone tampers with my orders, that person should be impaled on a beam torn from his own house and his house should be turned into a pile of rubble.
EZR.6.12	 May the God whose name is worshiped there cause the downfall of each king and nation who tries to tamper with my orders or tries to destroy the temple of the God in Jerusalem.
EZR.6.12	I, Darius, have issued a decree. It’s to be carried out exactly as ordered.
EZR.6.13	 Then Governor Tattenai ⌊from the province⌋ west of the Euphrates River, Shethar Bozenai, and their group did exactly what King Darius had ordered. 
EZR.6.14	 So the Jewish leaders continued to make progress because of the message from the prophet Haggai and Zechariah, the grandson of Iddo. They finished building as the God of Israel had ordered and as Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes (the kings of Persia) had ordered. 
EZR.6.15	 This temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar in the sixth year of King Darius’ reign.
EZR.6.16	 Then the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the others who had returned from exile celebrated at the dedication of God’s temple. 
EZR.6.17	 At the dedication of God’s temple, they sacrificed 100 bulls, 200 rams, and 400 lambs. They sacrificed 12 male goats as an offering for sin, one goat for each of the tribes of Israel.
EZR.6.18	 The priests were assigned to their divisions and the Levites to their groups ⌊to lead⌋ the worship of God in Jerusalem by following the directions written in the Book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	 On the fourteenth day of the first month, those who had returned from exile celebrated the Passover. 
EZR.6.20	 Since the priests and Levites had cleansed themselves, all of them were ⌊now⌋ clean.
EZR.6.21	 The lambs were eaten by the Israelites who had returned from exile and by all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of the non-Jews in the land to worship the L
EZR.6.22	 So for seven days they celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread because the L
EZR.7.1	 After these things, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra left Babylon.
EZR.7.1	Ezra was the son of Seraiah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Hilkiah, 
EZR.7.2	 who was the son of Shallum, who was the son of Zadok, who was the son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	 who was the son of Amariah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	 who was the son of Zerahiah, who was the son of Uzzi, who was the son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	 who was the son of Abishua, who was the son of Phinehas, who was the son of Eleazer, who was the son of Aaron (the first priest).
EZR.7.6	 As a scribe, Ezra was an expert in Moses’ Teachings, which the L
EZR.7.7	 Some Israelites (including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants) went to Jerusalem in Artaxerxes’ seventh year as king. 
EZR.7.8	 In that same year in the fifth month, Ezra arrived in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.9	 He had left Babylon on the first day of the first month, and on the first day of the fifth month, he arrived in Jerusalem, since his God was good to him. 
EZR.7.10	 Ezra was determined to study the L

EZR.7.12	 From: Artaxerxes, king of kings
EZR.7.12	To: Ezra the priest, a scribe for the Teachings of the God of Heaven:
EZR.7.12	I wish you peace and prosperity!
EZR.7.13	 I have issued a decree that any Israelites who are in my kingdom and want to go with you to Jerusalem may go. This also includes the priests and Levites. 
EZR.7.14	 I, the king, and my seven advisers are sending you to evaluate the situation in Judah and Jerusalem on the basis of your God’s Teachings, which you hold in your hands. 
EZR.7.15	 Also, you must take the silver and gold that the king and his advisers willingly contributed to the God of Israel, the God whose temple is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.16	 Take any silver and gold that you find in the whole province of Babylon when you take the gifts contributed by the people and the priests. They willingly contributed these gifts for the temple of their God in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.17	 You must use this money to buy bulls, rams, lambs, grain, and wine to offer on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	 You and your relatives may do whatever you think is right with the rest of the silver and gold. However, what you do must conform to the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	 The utensils that have been given to you so that they can be used in your God’s temple must all be presented to the God of Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.20	 You may use the king’s treasury to pay for anything else that you must provide for your God’s temple.
EZR.7.21	 I, King Artaxerxes, order all the treasurers ⌊in the province⌋ west of the Euphrates River to do exactly what Ezra the priest, a scribe for the Teachings of the God of Heaven, asks you to do. 
EZR.7.22	 ⌊You may give him⌋ up to 7,500 pounds of silver, 100 measures of wheat, 600 gallons of wine, 600 gallons of olive oil, and as much salt as he needs. 
EZR.7.23	 Whatever the God of heaven has commanded must be carried out in detail for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should God become angry with the king’s empire and his sons? 
EZR.7.24	 Furthermore, we are notifying you that you are forbidden to make any priest, Levite, singer, gatekeeper, servant, or worker in the temple of this God pay any taxes, fees, or tolls.
EZR.7.25	 You, Ezra, using your God’s wisdom—the Teachings you hold in your hands—will appoint judges and administrators for all the people who know your God’s Teachings and live ⌊in the province⌋ west of the Euphrates River. In addition, you will teach anyone who doesn’t know the Teachings.
EZR.7.26	 Whoever will not strictly follow your God’s Teachings and the king’s orders should be promptly exiled, have his goods confiscated, be imprisoned or be sentenced to die.
EZR.7.27	 ⌊I, Ezra, said:⌋ Thanks be to the L

EZR.8.1	 These are the leaders of the families and the genealogy of those who left Babylon with me during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
EZR.8.2	 from the family of Phinehas:
EZR.8.2	Gershom
EZR.8.2	from the family of Ithamar:
EZR.8.2	Daniel
EZR.8.3	 from the family of David:
EZR.8.3	Hattush, son of Shecaniah
EZR.8.3	from the family of Parosh:
EZR.8.3	Zechariah, with 150 males whose genealogies were known
EZR.8.4	 from the family of Pahath Moab:
EZR.8.4	Eliehoenai, son of Zerahiah, with 200 males
EZR.8.5	 from the family of Zattu: 
EZR.8.5	Shecaniah, son of Jahaziel, with 300 males
EZR.8.6	 from the family of Adin:
EZR.8.6	Ebed, son of Jonathan, with 50 males
EZR.8.7	 from the family of Elam:
EZR.8.7	Jeshaiah, son of Athaliah, with 70 males
EZR.8.8	 from the family of Shephatiah:
EZR.8.8	Zebadiah, son of Michael, with 80 males
EZR.8.9	 from the family of Joab:
EZR.8.9	Obadiah, son of Jehiel, with 210 males
EZR.8.10	 from the family of Bani: 
EZR.8.10	Shelomith, son of Josiphiah, with 160 males
EZR.8.11	 from the family of Bebai:
EZR.8.11	Zechariah, son of Bebai, with 38 males
EZR.8.12	 from the family of Azgad:
EZR.8.12	Johanan, son of Hakkatan, with 110 males
EZR.8.13	 from the family of Adonikam:
EZR.8.13	Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, who arrived later with 60 males
EZR.8.14	 from the family of Bigvai:
EZR.8.14	Uthai and Zabbud, with 70 males.
EZR.8.15	 I had this group gather by the river that flows to Ahava, and we camped there for three days. I noticed laypeople and priests there, but I didn’t find any Levites. 
EZR.8.16	 Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam (who were leading men) and for Joiarib and Elnathan (who were wise). 
EZR.8.17	 I sent them to Iddo, the leader in Casiphia. I told them to tell Iddo and his relatives, the temple servants in Casiphia, that they should bring us men who can serve in our God’s temple. 
EZR.8.18	 God was guiding us, so Iddo and his relatives brought us someone competent, Sherebiah, who was a descendant of Mahli, Levi, and Israel. They brought us 18 of Sherebiah’s sons and relatives. 
EZR.8.19	 They also brought Hashabiah, Jeshaiah (who was a descendant of Merari), 20 of Jeshaiah’s relatives and their sons, 
EZR.8.20	 and 220 temple servants. ⌊They were descended⌋ from the temple servants whom David and his officials had appointed to work for the Levites. These were all listed by name.
EZR.8.21	 Then I announced a fast there at the Ahava River so that we might humble ourselves in the presence of our God to ask him for a safe journey for ourselves, for our little ones, and for all our goods. 
EZR.8.22	 I was ashamed to ask the king for an armed escort with cavalry to help us against an enemy attack on the way. We had already told the king, “Our God works things out for the good of everyone who dedicates his life to serving him, but his power and his anger oppose everyone who abandons him.” 
EZR.8.23	 So we fasted and asked our God for a safe journey, and he answered our prayer.
EZR.8.24	 Then I selected 12 leaders from the priests—Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and 10 of their relatives. 
EZR.8.25	 I weighed for them the silver, the gold, and the utensils. ⌊These were⌋ the contributions that the king, his advisers, his officials, and all the Israelites had contributed for our God’s temple. 
EZR.8.26	 I weighed ⌊the contributions⌋ for them to guard: about 24 tons of silver, 100 silver utensils weighing 150 pounds apiece, 7,500 pounds of gold, 
EZR.8.27	 20 gold bowls weighing 18 pounds apiece, and two utensils of fine polished bronze that were as precious as gold. 
EZR.8.28	 I told them, “You and the utensils are holy to the L
EZR.8.29	 Guard them carefully. In Jerusalem, inside the storerooms of the L
EZR.8.30	 So the priests and the Levites took charge of the silver, the gold, and the utensils. They were responsible for bringing these items to the temple of our God in Jerusalem.
EZR.8.31	 Then we left the Ahava River on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem. God was guiding us, and he rescued us from our enemies and from ambushes along the way. 
EZR.8.32	 When we reached Jerusalem, we rested for three days. 
EZR.8.33	 On the fourth day we weighed the silver, the gold, and the utensils in our God’s temple. We put them under the supervision of Meremoth, son of the priest Uriah, as well as Eleazar, the son of Phinehas. The Levites, Jeshua’s son Jozabad, and Binnui’s son Noadiah, assisted them. 
EZR.8.34	 Everything was counted and weighed, and the entire weight was recorded at that time.
EZR.8.35	 The exiles who had come back from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, and 12 male goats for an offering for sin. All of these animals were burnt offerings for the L
EZR.8.36	 The exiles delivered the king’s orders to the king’s satraps and governors ⌊in the province⌋ west of the Euphrates River. These officials then gave their support to the people and the temple of God.
EZR.9.1	 After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, “The people of Israel, including the priests and Levites, have failed to keep themselves separate from the neighboring groups of people and from the disgusting practices of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. 
EZR.9.2	 The Israelites and their sons have married some of these foreign women. They have mixed our holy race with the neighboring groups of people. Furthermore, the leaders and officials have led the way in being unfaithful.”
EZR.9.3	 When I heard this, I tore my clothes ⌊in distress⌋, pulled hair from my scalp and my beard, and sat down in shock. 
EZR.9.4	 Since the former exiles had been unfaithful, everyone who gathered around me there trembled at the words of the God of Israel. I sat in shock until the evening sacrifice. 
EZR.9.5	 At the evening sacrifice I got up from my misery, and with my clothes torn, I knelt down, stretched out my hands to the L
EZR.9.6	 and said,
EZR.9.6	“I am ashamed, my God. I am embarrassed to look at you. Our sins have piled up over our heads, and our guilt is so overwhelming that it reaches heaven. 
EZR.9.7	 From our ancestors’ days until now, we have been deep in guilt. Our kings and our priests have been handed over to foreign kings to be executed. We have been taken captive, robbed, and humiliated, as we still are today because of our sins. 
EZR.9.8	 And now, for a brief moment, the L
EZR.9.9	 We are slaves, but our God hasn’t abandoned us in our slavery. Instead, he has made the kings of Persia treat us kindly. He did this to give us an opportunity to rebuild our God’s temple and restore its ruins and to give us a protective wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	 “And now, our God, what can we say after all this? We have abandoned your commandments! 
EZR.9.11	 The commandments you gave us through your servants the prophets, said, ‘The land you are going to take possession of has been polluted by its perverted people and by their disgusting practices that have filled it with wickedness from one end to another. 
EZR.9.12	 So never let your daughters marry their sons or your sons marry their daughters, and never seek peace or trade with them. Then you will be strong, be able to eat the good things the land produces, and be able to give this land as a long-lasting inheritance to your children.’
EZR.9.13	 “After all that has happened to us because of the evil things we have done and because of our overwhelming guilt, you, our God, have punished us far less than we deserve and have permitted a few of us to survive. 
EZR.9.14	 If we break your commandments again and intermarry with people doing these disgusting things, you will become even more angry with us until you finally destroy us and no survivors are left. 
EZR.9.15	 L
EZR.10.1	 While Ezra was praying, confessing ⌊these sins⌋, crying, and throwing himself down in front of God’s temple, a large crowd of Israelite men, women, and children gathered around him. They also began to cry bitterly. 
EZR.10.2	 Then Shecaniah, son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, interrupted by saying to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women who came from the people around us. However, there is still hope for Israel. 
EZR.10.3	 So we must now make a promise to our God to get rid of all foreign women and the children born from them, as my lord ⌊Ezra⌋ and the others who tremble at the commandments of our God have advised us to do. We must do what Moses’ Teachings tell us. 
EZR.10.4	 Get up! It’s your duty to take action. We are with you, so be strong and take action.”
EZR.10.5	 Then Ezra got up and made the leaders, priests, Levites, and all the rest of Israel swear to do what they had said. So they took an oath. 
EZR.10.6	 Then Ezra left the front of God’s temple and went to the room of Jehohanan, son of Eliashib. Ezra didn’t eat any food or drink any water while he was there. He was mourning because these former exiles had been so unfaithful.
EZR.10.7	 Then he sent a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the former exiles must gather in Jerusalem. 
EZR.10.8	 If any of them didn’t come within three days as the leaders and the older men had advised, then they would lose all their property and be excluded from the community of former exiles. 
EZR.10.9	 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered within three days in Jerusalem. On the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people sat in the courtyard of God’s temple. They were trembling because of this matter and shivering because of the heavy rain.
EZR.10.10	 Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women, and now you have added to Israel’s guilt. 
EZR.10.11	 Confess to the L
EZR.10.12	 Then the whole assembly shouted in reply, “Yes! We will do as you say. 
EZR.10.13	 But the crowd is too large, and it’s the rainy season. We can’t take care of this outside. Besides, there are so many of us who are involved in this sin that it can’t be taken care of in a day or two. 
EZR.10.14	 Let our leaders represent the whole community. At a set time, everyone who has married a foreign woman must meet with the leaders and judges of each city until our God’s burning anger has turned away from us in this matter.”
EZR.10.15	 (Only Jonathan, Asahel’s son, and Jahzeiah, Tikvah’s son, opposed this. Meshullam and Shabbethai, the Levite, supported Jonathan and Jahzeiah.)
EZR.10.16	 The former exiles did this. Ezra the priest chose men who were heads of families. He chose one from each family division. (They were all ⌊listed⌋ by name.) They sat down on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter. 
EZR.10.17	 By the first day of the first month, they had finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.
EZR.10.18	 Among the descendants of the priests, the following were married to foreign women: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah, a descendant of Jeshua (who was Jozadak’s son) and his brothers. 
EZR.10.19	 They shook hands as a pledge that they would get rid of their wives. They sacrificed a ram from their flock as an offering for guilt because they were guilty.

NEH.1.1	 These are the words of Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah:
NEH.1.1	During the month of Chislev, in Artaxerxes’ twentieth year as king, while I was in the fortress at Susa, 
NEH.1.2	 one of my brothers, Hanani, arrived with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had survived captivity and about Jerusalem. 
NEH.1.3	 They told me, “Those who survived captivity are in the province. They are enduring serious troubles and being insulted. The wall of Jerusalem has been broken down, and its gates have been destroyed by fire.”
NEH.1.4	 When I heard this, I sat down and cried. I mourned for days. I continued to fast and pray to the God of heaven. 
NEH.1.5	 I said,
NEH.1.5	“L
NEH.1.6	 Open your eyes, and pay close attention with your ears to what I, your servant, am praying. I am praying to you day and night about your servants the Israelites. I confess the sins that we Israelites have committed against you as well as the sins that my father’s family and I have committed. 
NEH.1.7	 We have done you a great wrong. We haven’t obeyed the commandments, laws, or regulations that you gave us through your servant Moses. 
NEH.1.8	 Please remember what you told us through your servant Moses: ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations. 
NEH.1.9	 But if you return to me and continue to obey my commandments, though your people may be driven to the most distant point on the horizon, I will come and get you from there and bring you to the place where I chose to put my name.’ 
NEH.1.10	 These are your servants and your people whom you have saved by your great power and your strong hand. 
NEH.1.11	 Lord, please pay attention to my prayer and to the prayers of all your other servants who want to worship your name. Please give me success today and make this man, King Artaxerxes, show me compassion.”
NEH.1.11	I was cupbearer 
NEH.2.1	 In the month of Nisan, in Artaxerxes’ twentieth year as king, after some wine was brought for the king, I picked up the cup of wine and gave it to the king. I had never been sad in his presence before.
NEH.2.2	 The king asked me, “Why do you look so sad? You aren’t sick, are you? You must be troubled about something.” (I was really afraid).
NEH.2.3	 “May the king live forever!” I said to the king. “Why shouldn’t I look sad when the city, the place where my ancestors are buried, is in ruins and its gates are burned down?”
NEH.2.4	 “What do you want?” the king asked me.
NEH.2.4	So I prayed to the God of heaven, 
NEH.2.5	 and I asked the king, “If it pleases Your Majesty, and you are willing to grant my request, let me go to Judah, to the city where my ancestors are buried, so that I can rebuild it.”
NEH.2.6	 Then, while the queen was sitting beside him, the king asked me, “How long will you be gone, and when will you come back?” When I gave him a specific date, he was willing to let me go.
NEH.2.7	 I also asked the king, “If it pleases Your Majesty, let me have letters addressed to the governors ⌊of the province⌋ west of the Euphrates River. In the letters tell them to grant me safe conduct until I arrive in Judah. 
NEH.2.8	 Also, let me have a letter addressed to Asaph, the supervisor of Your Majesty’s forest. In the letter order him to give me wood for the gates of the fortress near the temple, for the city wall, and for the house I’ll move into.” (The king let me have the letters, because God was guiding me.)
NEH.2.9	 I went to the governors ⌊of the province⌋ west of the Euphrates River and gave them the king’s letters. (The king had sent army officers and cavalry to be with me.) 
NEH.2.10	 But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammon ite servant heard this, they were very upset that someone had come to give the people of Israel so much assistance.
NEH.2.11	 I went to Jerusalem and was there for three days. 
NEH.2.12	 During the night I went out with a few men without telling anyone what my God had inspired me to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I had was the one I was riding. 
NEH.2.13	 I went through Valley Gate that night toward Snake Fountain and Dung Gate and examined the places where the walls of Jerusalem were broken down and where its gates had been burned. 
NEH.2.14	 Passing through Fountain Gate, I arrived at King’s Pool, but the animal I was riding couldn’t get through. 
NEH.2.15	 So I went through the valley that night and examined the wall. Then I turned back, entered Valley Gate, and returned.
NEH.2.16	 The officials didn’t know where I had gone or what I had done. I hadn’t yet told the Jews, the priests, the leaders, the other officials, or any of the rest who would be doing the work. 
NEH.2.17	 Then I told them, “You see the trouble we’re in. Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates are burned down. Let’s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be insulted.” 
NEH.2.18	 Then I told them that my God had been guiding me and what the king had told me.
NEH.2.18	They replied, “Let’s begin to rebuild.” So they encouraged one another to begin this God-pleasing work.
NEH.2.19	 When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammon ite servant, and Geshem the Arab heard about this, they made fun of us and ridiculed us. They asked, “What are you doing? Are you going to rebel against the king?”
NEH.2.20	 “The God of heaven will give us success,” I answered them. “We, his servants, are going to rebuild. You have no property or claim or historic right in Jerusalem.”
NEH.3.1	 The chief priest Eliashib and his relatives, the priests, started by rebuilding Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set its doors in place. They rebuilt as far as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and then as far as the Tower of Hananel. 
NEH.3.2	 The men from Jericho were rebuilding next to Eliashib. Zaccur, son of Imri, was next to them. 
NEH.3.3	 The sons of Hassenaah rebuilt Fish Gate. They laid its beams and set its doors, locks, and bars in place. 
NEH.3.4	 Next to them Meremoth, son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, made repairs. Next to them Meshullam, son of Berechiah and grandson of Meshezabel, made repairs. Next to them Zadok, son of Baana, made repairs. 
NEH.3.5	 Next to them the men from Tekoa made repairs. However, the nobles wouldn’t lower themselves to work under supervisors.
NEH.3.6	 Joiada, Paseah’s son, and Meshullam, Besodeiah’s son, made repairs on Old Gate. They laid its beams and set its doors, locks, and bars in place. 
NEH.3.7	 Next to them Melatiah from Gibeon and Jadon from Meronoth, with men from Gibeon and Mizpah, made repairs on the wall. They did this under the authority of the governor ⌊from the province⌋ west of the Euphrates River. 
NEH.3.8	 Next to them Uzziel, Harhaiah’s son, a goldsmith, made repairs. Next to him Hananiah, a perfume maker, made repairs. They left out part of Jerusalem as far as Broad Wall. 
NEH.3.9	 Next to them Rephaiah, Hur’s son, an official in charge of half a district of Jerusalem, made repairs. 
NEH.3.10	 Next to them Jedaiah, Harumaph’s son, made repairs across from his own home. Next to them Hattush, Hashabneiah’s son, made repairs. 
NEH.3.11	 Malchiah, Harim’s son, and Hasshub, Pahath Moab’s son, made repairs on a section that included the Tower of the Ovens. 
NEH.3.12	 Next to them Shallum, Hallohesh’s son, an official in charge of half a district of Jerusalem, made repairs with the help of his daughters.
NEH.3.13	 Hanun and the people of Zanoah repaired Valley Gate. They rebuilt it and set its doors, locks, and bars in place, and they repaired 1,500 feet of the wall, as far as Dung Gate. 
NEH.3.14	 Dung Gate itself was repaired by Malchiah, Rechab’s son, the official in charge of the district of Beth Hakkerem. He rebuilt it and set its doors, locks, and bars in place.
NEH.3.15	 Shallun, Col Hozeh’s son, the official in charge of the district of Mizpah, repaired Fountain Gate. He rebuilt it, put a roof over it, and set its doors, locks, and bars in place. He also made repairs on the wall of the Pool of Shelah by the King’s Garden as far as the stairs going down from the City of David. 
NEH.3.16	 After him Nehemiah, Azbuk’s son, the official in charge of half the district of Beth Zur, made repairs all the way to a point across from the tombs of David as far as the pool and the soldiers’ barracks. 
NEH.3.17	 After him the Levites, including Rehum (Bani’s son), made repairs. Next to him Hashabiah, the official in charge of half the district of Keilah, made repairs for his district. 
NEH.3.18	 After him their relatives made repairs. This included Binnui, Henadad’s son, the official in charge of half the district of Keilah. 
NEH.3.19	 Next to him Ezer, Jeshua’s son, the official in charge of Mizpah, repaired a section across from the ascent to the Armory at the Angle. 
NEH.3.20	 After him Baruch, Zabbai’s son,
NEH.3.21	 After him Meremoth, son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, made repairs on a section from the door of Eliashib’s house to the end of Eliashib’s house. 
NEH.3.22	 After him the priests who lived in that area made repairs. 
NEH.3.23	 After them Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs across from their own homes. After them Azariah, son of Maaseiah and grandson of Ananiah, made repairs next to his home. 
NEH.3.24	 After him Binnui, Henadad’s son, made repairs on a section from Azariah’s home to the Angle and to the corner of the wall. 
NEH.3.25	 Palal, Uzai’s son, made repairs across from the Angle and the upper tower that projects from the king’s palace to the guards’ courtyard. After him Pedaiah, Parosh’s son, 
NEH.3.26	 and the temple servants who were living on the Ophel made repairs on the wall as far as a point across from Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower. 
NEH.3.27	 After him the men from Tekoa repaired a section across from the large projecting tower as far as the Wall of the Ophel.
NEH.3.28	 Above Horse Gate the priests made repairs. Each priest made repairs across from his own home. 
NEH.3.29	 After them Zadok, Immer’s son, made repairs across from his own home. After him Shemaiah, Shecaniah’s son, the guard at East Gate, made repairs. 
NEH.3.30	 After him Hananiah, Shelemiah’s son, and Hanun, Zalaph’s sixth son, repaired another section. After him Meshullam, Berechiah’s son, made repairs across from his living quarters. 
NEH.3.31	 After him Malchiah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the building that housed the temple servants and merchants across from Inspection Gate and as far as the upper room at the corner. 
NEH.3.32	 The goldsmiths and merchants made repairs between the upper room at the corner and Sheep Gate.
NEH.4.1	 When Sanballat heard we were rebuilding the wall, he became enraged and made fun of the Jews. 
NEH.4.2	 In front of his allies and the army from Samaria, he said, “What do these miserable Jews think they’re doing? Can they rebuild it by themselves? Are they going to offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in a day? Will they get the stones out of the rubbish heaps, burned as these stones are, and give them new strength?”
NEH.4.3	 Tobiah the Ammon ite, who was beside Sanballat, said, “Even a fox would make their stone wall collapse if it walked on top of what they’re building!”
NEH.4.4	 ⌊Nehemiah prayed,⌋ “Our God, hear us. We are despised. Turn their insults back on them, and let them be robbed in the land where they are prisoners. 
NEH.4.5	 Don’t ignore their guilt, and don’t let their sins disappear from your records. They have insulted you in front of these builders.”
NEH.4.6	 So we rebuilt the wall, which was rebuilt to about half its ⌊original⌋ height. The people worked with determination.
NEH.4.7	 When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people from Ashdod heard that the repair work on the walls of Jerusalem was making progress and that the gaps were being filled in, they became furious. 
NEH.4.8	 All of them plotted to attack Jerusalem to create confusion. 
NEH.4.9	 But we prayed to our God and set guards to protect us day and night.
NEH.4.10	 Then the people of Judah said, “The work crews are worn out, and there is too much rubble. We can’t continue to rebuild the wall.”
NEH.4.11	 Our enemies said, “Before they know what is happening or see a thing, we will be right in the middle of them. We’ll kill them and bring the work to an end.”
NEH.4.12	 Jews who were living near our enemies warned us ten times that our enemies would attack us from every direction.
NEH.4.13	 That is why I positioned people by their families behind the wall where it was lowest and most exposed. The people were armed with swords, spears, and bows. 
NEH.4.14	 I looked them over and proceeded to tell the nobles, the leaders, and the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of our enemies. Remember how great and awe-inspiring the L
NEH.4.15	 When our enemies heard that we knew about their plots and that God had prevented their plans from being successful, we all went back to the work on the wall. Each person performed his own job. 
NEH.4.16	 From that day on, half of my men worked on the wall, and the other half were wearing body armor and holding spears, shields, and bows. The leaders stood behind all the Judeans 
NEH.4.17	 who were rebuilding the wall. The workers who were carrying loads did the work with one hand and held their weapons with the other, 
NEH.4.18	 and each builder had his sword fastened to his side. The man who was supposed to sound the trumpet alarm was with me. 
NEH.4.19	 I told the nobles, the leaders, and the rest of the people, “So much work has to be done in different places that we are widely separated from one another on the wall. 
NEH.4.20	 When you hear the trumpet, assemble around me. Our God will fight for us!”
NEH.4.21	 So we continued to work. Half of us held spears from early dawn until the stars came out. 
NEH.4.22	 At that time I told the people, “Every man and his servant should stay overnight in Jerusalem so that we can set a guard at night and work during the day.” 
NEH.4.23	 My brothers, my servants, and the guards assigned to me never changed their clothes. Neither did I. We each kept our weapons at hand.
NEH.5.1	 Then some of the people, the men and their wives, complained publicly about their Jewish relatives. 
NEH.5.2	 Some of them said, “We have large families! We need some grain ⌊if we are going⌋ to eat and stay alive.” 
NEH.5.3	 Others said, “We’ve had to mortgage our fields, our vineyards, and our homes in order to get some grain because of this famine.” 
NEH.5.4	 Others said, “We’ve had to borrow money to pay the king’s taxes on our fields and vineyards. 
NEH.5.5	 We have the same flesh and blood as our relatives. Our children are just like theirs. Yet, we have to force our sons and daughters to become slaves. Some of our daughters have already become slaves. But we can’t do anything else when our fields and vineyards belong to others.”
NEH.5.6	 I became furious when I heard their complaint and what they had to say. 
NEH.5.7	 After thinking it over, I confronted the nobles and the leaders. I told them, “You are charging interest on loans made to your own relatives.” I arranged for a large meeting to deal with them. 
NEH.5.8	 Then I told them, “We have done our best to buy back our Jewish relatives who had been sold to other nations. Now you are selling your Jewish relatives so that we have to buy them back again!” They were unable to say anything. 
NEH.5.9	 I added, “What you’re doing is wrong. Shouldn’t you live in the fear of our God to keep our enemies from ridiculing us? 
NEH.5.10	 My brothers, my servants, and I are lending money and grain to the poor. But we must stop charging them interest. 
NEH.5.11	 You must return their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their homes today. Also, you must return the interest on the money, grain, new wine, and olive oil you’ve been charging them.”
NEH.5.12	 They responded, “We’ll return it and not try to get it from them ⌊again⌋. We’ll do what you say.” Then I called the priests and made them swear to do what they promised. 
NEH.5.13	 I brushed off my clothes and said, “In the same way, may God brush off from home and work everyone who refuses to keep this promise. In the same way, may everyone be brushed off and left with nothing.” Then the whole congregation said amen and praised the L
NEH.5.14	 During the 12 years that I was governor of Judah, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes’ reign to the thirty-second year of his reign, my brothers and I never ate any food that was paid for by the governor’s food allowance. 
NEH.5.15	 Those who were governors before me had made life difficult for the people by taking from them food and wine plus one pound of silver. Even the governors’ servants took advantage of their power over the people. But I didn’t do that, because I feared God. 
NEH.5.16	 Instead, I put my best effort into the work on this wall, and we bought no land. All my men gathered here for work. 
NEH.5.17	 I fed 150 Jewish leaders and their people who came to us from the surrounding nations. 
NEH.5.18	 Preparing one ox and six choice sheep was necessary every day. Poultry was prepared for me. Once every ten days a supply of wine was ordered. Yet, in spite of all this, I never demanded anything from the governor’s food allowance, because these people were already carrying a heavy load.
NEH.5.19	 Remember me, my God. Consider everything that I have done for these people.
NEH.6.1	 Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and that no gaps had been left in it (although at that time I had not yet hung the doors in the city gates). 
NEH.6.2	 Then Sanballat and Geshem sent this message to me: “Let’s meet in Hakkephirim on the plain of Ono.” They were planning to harm me.
NEH.6.3	 I sent messengers to tell them, “I’m working on an important project and can’t get away. Why should the work stop while I leave to meet with you?” 
NEH.6.4	 They sent the same message to me four times, and I answered them the same way. 
NEH.6.5	 When Sanballat sent me the same message a fifth time, his servant held in his hand an unsealed letter. 
NEH.6.6	 In it was written:
NEH.6.6	It has been reported throughout the nations, and Geshem has confirmed it, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel. That’s why you’re rebuilding the wall. According to this report, you want to become their king. 
NEH.6.7	 You’ve appointed prophets to announce about you in Jerusalem, ‘There’s a king in Judah!’ This report will get back to the king. So let’s talk about this.
NEH.6.8	 Then I sent someone to tell him, “None of your accusations are true. You are making them up out of your own imagination.”
NEH.6.9	 They were all trying to intimidate us. They thought we would give up and not finish the work.
NEH.6.9	But God made me strong.
NEH.6.10	 ⌊One day⌋ I went to the home of Shemaiah, son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel. Shemaiah who was confined to his house, said, “Let’s meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and close the temple doors. Some men are coming at night to kill you.”
NEH.6.11	 But I asked, “Should a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the temple to save his life? I won’t go.”
NEH.6.12	 Then I realized that God hadn’t sent him. Instead, Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him to prophesy against me. 
NEH.6.13	 He was hired to intimidate me into doing this so that I would sin. Then they could give me a bad reputation in order to discredit me.
NEH.6.14	 ⌊Nehemiah prayed,⌋ “My God, remember what Tobiah and Sanballat have done. Also, remember the female prophet Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me.”
NEH.6.15	 The wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul. The wall took 52 days to finish. 
NEH.6.16	 When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence. They realized we had done this work with the help of our God.
NEH.6.17	 In those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah sent many letters back to them. 
NEH.6.18	 Many in Judah had promised to support Tobiah because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah, Arah’s son. In addition, Tobiah’s son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam, Berechiah’s son. 
NEH.6.19	 The nobles were singing Tobiah’s praises to me and reporting to him what I said. Tobiah kept sending letters to intimidate me.
NEH.7.1	 The gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites were assigned their duties after the wall had been rebuilt and I had hung the doors. 
NEH.7.2	 I put my brother Hanani and Hananiah, the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem. Hananiah was a trustworthy man, and he feared God more than most people do. 
NEH.7.3	 I told them, “The gates of Jerusalem should not be opened at the hottest time of the day. While the ⌊gatekeepers⌋ are still standing there, they should shut the doors and bar them. Order some of the men in Jerusalem to stand guard, some at their posts and others in front of their homes.” 
NEH.7.4	 The city was large and wide-open. Few people were in it, and no houses were being built.
NEH.7.5	 Then my God put the idea into my head that I should gather the nobles, leaders, and people so that they could check their genealogy. I found the book with the genealogy of those who came back the first time. I found the following written in it:
NEH.7.6	 These were the people in the province. They were the ones who left the place where the exiles had been taken captive. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had taken them captive. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah. All of them went to their own cities. 
NEH.7.7	 They went with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.
NEH.7.7	This is the number of Israelite men from the people in exile:

NEH.7.23	 of Bezai—324
NEH.7.24	 of Hariph—112
NEH.7.25	 of Gibeon—95
NEH.7.26	 the people of Bethlehem and Netophah—188
NEH.7.27	 of Anathoth—128
NEH.7.28	 of Beth Azmaveth—42
NEH.7.29	 of Kiriath Jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth—743
NEH.7.30	 of Ramah and Geba—621
NEH.7.31	 of Michmas—122
NEH.7.32	 of Bethel and Ai—123
NEH.7.33	 of the other Nebo—52
NEH.7.34	 of the other Elam—1,254
NEH.7.35	 of Harim—320
NEH.7.36	 of Jericho—345
NEH.7.37	 of Lod, Hadid, and Ono—721
NEH.7.38	 of Senaah—3,930
NEH.7.39	 These priests returned from exile:
NEH.7.39	the descendants of Jedaiah (through the family of Jeshua)—973
NEH.7.40	 of Immer—1,052
NEH.7.41	 of Pashhur—1,247
NEH.7.42	 of Harim—1,017
NEH.7.43	 These Levites returned from exile:
NEH.7.43	the descendants of Jeshua, that is, of Kadmiel ⌊and⌋ of Hodeiah—74
NEH.7.44	 These singers returned from exile:
NEH.7.44	the descendants of Asaph—148
NEH.7.45	 These gatekeepers returned from exile:
NEH.7.45	the descendants of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai—138
NEH.7.46	 These temple servants returned from exile: the descendants of Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth, 
NEH.7.47	 Keros, Sia, Padon, 
NEH.7.48	 Lebanah, Hagabah, Shalmai, 
NEH.7.49	 Hanan, Giddel, Gahar, 
NEH.7.50	 Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda, 
NEH.7.51	 Gazzam, Uzza, Paseah, 
NEH.7.52	 Besai, Meunim, Nephusheshim, 
NEH.7.53	 Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur, 
NEH.7.54	 Bazlith, Mehida, Harsha, 
NEH.7.55	 Barkos, Sisera, Temah, 
NEH.7.56	 Neziah, and Hatipha.
NEH.7.57	 These descendants of Solomon’s servants returned from exile: the descendants of Sotai, Sophereth, Perida, 
NEH.7.58	 Jaala, Darkon, Giddel, 
NEH.7.59	 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth Hazzebaim, and Amon.
NEH.7.60	 The temple servants and the descendants of Solomon’s servants totaled 392.
NEH.7.61	 The following people came from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but they couldn’t prove they were Israelites on the basis of their father’s family or their genealogy: 
NEH.7.62	 the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda. These people totaled 642.
NEH.7.63	 These priests ⌊couldn’t prove they were Israelites⌋: the descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai (who had married one of the daughters of Barzillai from Gilead and took that ⌊family⌋ name). 
NEH.7.64	 These people searched for their ⌊family⌋ names in the genealogical records, but their names couldn’t be found there. For this reason they were considered contaminated and couldn’t be priests. 
NEH.7.65	 The governor told them not to eat any of the most holy food until a priest could use the Urim and Thummim 
NEH.7.66	 The whole assembly totaled 42,360. 
NEH.7.67	 In addition to the male and female servants who numbered 7,337, they also had 245 male and female singers. 
NEH.7.68	 They had 736 horses, 245 mules,
NEH.7.69	 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
NEH.7.70	 Some of the heads of the families contributed to this work. The governor contributed the following to the treasury: nearly 18 pounds of gold, 50 bowls, and 530 robes for the priests. 
NEH.7.71	 Some of the heads of the families contributed to the treasury for this work: 337 pounds of gold and 3,215 pounds of silver. 
NEH.7.72	 The rest of the people contributed 337 pounds of gold, 2,923 pounds of silver, and 67 robes for the priests.
NEH.7.73	 The priests, Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and the rest of Israel settled in their own cities. When the seventh month came, the people of Israel were in their own cities.
NEH.8.1	 ⌊When the seventh month came,⌋ all the people gathered together in the courtyard in front of Water Gate. They told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of Moses’ Teachings, which the Lord had commanded Israel ⌊to follow⌋. 
NEH.8.2	 Then Ezra the priest brought the Teachings in front of the assembly. This included men, women, and any ⌊children⌋ who could understand what they heard. This took place on the first day of the seventh month. 
NEH.8.3	 From daybreak until noon, he read from it in the courtyard in front of Water Gate to the men, women, and ⌊children⌋ who could understand it. All the people listened to the Book of Moses’ Teachings.
NEH.8.4	 Ezra the scribe stood on a raised wooden platform made for this occasion. Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah stood beside him on his right. Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchiah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam stood beside him on his left. 
NEH.8.5	 Ezra, standing higher than all the other people, opened the book in front of all the people. As he opened it, all the people stood up. 
NEH.8.6	 Ezra thanked the L
NEH.8.7	 The Levites— Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah—explained the Teachings to the people while they were standing there. 
NEH.8.8	 They read the Book of God’s Teachings clearly and explained the meaning so that the people could understand what was read.
NEH.8.9	 Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people told them, “This is a holy day for the L
NEH.8.10	 Then he told them, “Go, eat rich foods, drink sweet drinks, and send portions to those who cannot provide for themselves. Today is a holy day for the Lord. Don’t be sad because the joy you have in the L
NEH.8.11	 So the Levites calmed all the people by saying, “Listen. Today is a holy day. Don’t be sad.”
NEH.8.12	 Then all the people went to eat and drink and to send portions. They had a big, joyful celebration because they understood the words that had been explained to them.
NEH.8.13	 On the second day the leaders of the families of all the people, including the priests and the Levites, met with Ezra the scribe to study the words of God’s Teachings. 
NEH.8.14	 They found written in the Teachings that the L
NEH.8.15	 They should announce this command and send this message throughout all their cities and Jerusalem: “Go to the mountains, and get branches—olive and wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other thick-leaved branches—to make booths as it is written.”
NEH.8.16	 So the people went to get branches to make booths for themselves. Some made booths on their roofs, others in their courtyards, in the courtyards of God’s temple, in the open area by Water Gate, or in the open area at Ephraim Gate.
NEH.8.17	 The whole assembly that had come back from exile made booths and lived in them. From the time of Jeshua (son of Nun) to that day, the people of Israel had not done this. There was a big, joyful celebration. 
NEH.8.18	 Day by day, from the first day of the festival to the last day, Ezra continued to read from the Book of God’s Teachings. The people celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, they had a closing festival assembly in accordance with the regulations.
NEH.9.1	 When the Israelites assembled on the twenty-fourth day of this month, they fasted, wore sackcloth, and threw dirt on their heads. 
NEH.9.2	 Those who were descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood and confessed their sins as well as the wicked things their ancestors had done. 
NEH.9.3	 They stood in their places, and for one-fourth of the day, ⌊they listened as⌋ the Book of the Teachings of the L
NEH.9.4	 Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chanani stood on the stairs built for the Levites and cried loudly to the L
NEH.9.5	 Then the Levites— Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said, “Stand up, and thank the L
NEH.9.5	From everlasting to everlasting your glorious name is praised
NEH.9.5	and lifted high above all blessing and praise.
NEH.9.6	 You alone are the L
NEH.9.6	You made heaven, the highest heaven, with all its armies.
NEH.9.6	You made the earth and everything on it,
NEH.9.6	the seas and everything in them.
NEH.9.6	You give life to them all, and the armies of heaven worship you.

NEH.9.7	and gave him the name Abraham.
NEH.9.8	 You found that his heart was faithful to you.
NEH.9.8	You made a promise 
NEH.9.8	Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites to his descendants.
NEH.9.8	You kept your promise because you are fair.
NEH.9.9	 You saw how our ancestors suffered in Egypt,
NEH.9.9	and you heard them crying at the Red Sea.
NEH.9.10	 You performed miraculous signs and did amazing things to Pharaoh
NEH.9.10	and all his servants and all the people in his land
NEH.9.10	because you knew how arrogantly
NEH.9.10	they were treating our ancestors.
NEH.9.10	You made a name for yourself, a name which remains to this day.
NEH.9.11	 You divided the sea in front of them
NEH.9.11	so that they could walk through the sea on dry ground.
NEH.9.11	You threw into deep water those who pursued your people
NEH.9.11	as someone throws a stone into raging water.
NEH.9.12	 You led them during the day by a column of smoke
NEH.9.12	and during the night by a column of fire to give them light
NEH.9.12	to see the way they should go.
NEH.9.13	 You came from heaven to Mount Sinai
NEH.9.13	and spoke with them from heaven.
NEH.9.13	You gave them fair rules, trustworthy teachings,
NEH.9.13	and good laws and commandments.
NEH.9.14	 You taught them about your holy day of worship.
NEH.9.14	You gave them commandments, laws, and teachings
NEH.9.14	through your servant Moses.
NEH.9.15	 You gave them bread from heaven to satisfy their hunger
NEH.9.15	and made water flow from a rock to quench their thirst.
NEH.9.15	You told them to take possession of the land
NEH.9.15	that you swore you would give them.
NEH.9.16	 But they—our own ancestors—acted arrogantly.
NEH.9.16	They became stubborn and wouldn’t obey your commands.
NEH.9.17	 They refused to listen.
NEH.9.17	They forgot the miracles you performed for them.
NEH.9.17	They became stubborn and appointed a leader
NEH.9.17	to take them back to slavery ⌊in Egypt⌋.
NEH.9.17	But you are a forgiving God,
NEH.9.17	one who is compassionate, merciful, patient,
NEH.9.17	and always ready to forgive.
NEH.9.17	You never abandoned them,
NEH.9.18	 even when they made a metal statue of a calf for themselves
NEH.9.18	and said, ‘This is your god who took you out of Egypt.’
NEH.9.18	They committed outrageous sins.
NEH.9.19	 But because of your endless compassion,
NEH.9.19	you didn’t abandon them in the desert.
NEH.9.19	The column of smoke didn’t leave them during the day,
NEH.9.19	but it led them on their way.
NEH.9.19	The column of fire didn’t leave them during the night,
NEH.9.19	but it gave them light to see the way they should go.
NEH.9.20	 You gave them your good Spirit to teach them.
NEH.9.20	You didn’t keep your manna to yourself.
NEH.9.20	You gave them water to quench their thirst.
NEH.9.21	 You provided for them in the desert for 40 years,
NEH.9.21	and they had everything they needed.
NEH.9.21	Their clothes didn’t wear out, and their feet didn’t swell.
NEH.9.22	 You gave kingdoms and nations to the Israelites
NEH.9.22	and assigned them their boundaries.
NEH.9.22	So they took possession of the land of Sihon,
NEH.9.22	the land of the king of Heshbon,
NEH.9.22	and the land of King Og of Bashan.
NEH.9.23	 You made their children as numerous as the stars in the sky.
NEH.9.23	You brought them into the land you told their parents to enter and possess.
NEH.9.24	 Their children took possession of the land.
NEH.9.24	You defeated for them the Canaanites, who lived in the land.
NEH.9.24	You handed the Canaanite kings and their people over to them
NEH.9.24	to do whatever they wanted with the Canaanites.
NEH.9.25	 The Israelites captured fortified cities and a rich land.
NEH.9.25	They took possession of houses filled with all sorts of good things,
NEH.9.25	cisterns, vineyards, olive trees,
NEH.9.25	and plenty of fruit trees.
NEH.9.25	So they ate and were satisfied and grew fat.
NEH.9.25	They enjoyed the vast supply of good things you gave them.
NEH.9.26	 But they were defiant and rebelled against you.
NEH.9.26	They threw your teachings over their shoulders
NEH.9.26	and killed your prophets who warned them to turn back to you.
NEH.9.26	They committed outrageous sins.
NEH.9.27	 You handed them over to their enemies, who made them suffer.
NEH.9.27	When they began to suffer, they cried to you.
NEH.9.27	You heard them from heaven.
NEH.9.27	You gave them saviors to rescue them from their enemies
NEH.9.27	because of your endless compassion.
NEH.9.28	 As soon as they felt some relief,
NEH.9.28	they were again doing what you considered evil.
NEH.9.28	You abandoned them to their enemies, who conquered them.
NEH.9.28	They cried to you again, and you heard them from heaven.
NEH.9.28	You rescued them many times because of your compassion.
NEH.9.29	 You warned them in order to bring them back to your teachings,
NEH.9.29	but they became arrogant and would not obey your commandments.
NEH.9.29	They sinned by not following your regulations.
NEH.9.29	If anyone follows them, he will find life in them.
NEH.9.29	But they gave you the cold shoulder,
NEH.9.29	became impossible to deal with, and wouldn’t listen.
NEH.9.30	 You were patient with them for many years.
NEH.9.30	You warned them by your Spirit through your prophets.
NEH.9.30	However, they wouldn’t listen.
NEH.9.30	So you handed them over to the people in the surrounding nations.
NEH.9.31	 But your compassion is endless.
NEH.9.31	You didn’t destroy them or abandon them.
NEH.9.31	You are a merciful and compassionate God.
NEH.9.32	 And now, our God, you are the great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God.
NEH.9.32	You faithfully keep your promises.
NEH.9.32	Do not consider all the hardships
NEH.9.32	that we have been going through as unimportant.
NEH.9.32	The hardships have come to our kings, leaders, priests, prophets,
NEH.9.32	ancestors, and all your people
NEH.9.32	from the time of the kings of Assyria until now.
NEH.9.33	 But you were fair about everything that has happened to us.
NEH.9.33	You have been faithful, but we have been wicked.
NEH.9.34	 Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors didn’t obey your teachings.
NEH.9.34	They didn’t pay attention to your commandments or the warnings
NEH.9.34	that you gave them.
NEH.9.35	 When they lived in their own kingdom and enjoyed the many good things
NEH.9.35	that you gave them in a vast, fertile land
NEH.9.35	which was set in front of them, they didn’t serve you
NEH.9.35	or turn away from their wicked lives.
NEH.9.36	 Look ⌊at us⌋ now. We’re slaves!
NEH.9.36	In the land you gave our ancestors,
NEH.9.36	they could eat its produce and ⌊enjoy⌋ its good things.
NEH.9.36	But now we’re slaves!
NEH.9.37	 The many products ⌊from our land⌋ go to the kings you put over us.
NEH.9.37	This is because of our sins.
NEH.9.37	These kings have control over our bodies,
NEH.9.37	and they do as they please with our livestock.
NEH.9.37	We are in agony.
NEH.9.38	 “We are making a binding agreement ⌊and putting it⌋ in writing because of all this. Our leaders, Levites, and priests are putting their seals on the document.”
NEH.10.1	 The following people sealed the agreement: Governor Nehemiah (son of Hacaliah), Zedekiah, 
NEH.10.2	 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.10.3	 Pashhur, Amariah, Malchiah, 
NEH.10.4	 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, 
NEH.10.5	 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah, 
NEH.10.6	 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, 
NEH.10.7	 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, 
NEH.10.8	 Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah. These were the priests.
NEH.10.9	 These were the Levites: Jeshua (son of Azaniah), Binnui (of the sons of Henadad), Kadmiel, 
NEH.10.10	 and their relatives Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, 
NEH.10.11	 Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, 
NEH.10.12	 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah, 
NEH.10.13	 Hodiah, Bani, and Beninu.
NEH.10.14	 These were the leaders of the people: Parosh, Pahath Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 
NEH.10.15	 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, 
NEH.10.16	 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 
NEH.10.17	 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 
NEH.10.18	 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, 
NEH.10.19	 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai, 
NEH.10.20	 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, 
NEH.10.21	 Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua, 
NEH.10.22	 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah, 
NEH.10.23	 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub, 
NEH.10.24	 Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek, 
NEH.10.25	 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, 
NEH.10.26	 Ahiah, Hanan, Anan, 
NEH.10.27	 Malluch, Harim, and Baanah.
NEH.10.28	 The rest of the people took an oath. These people included the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, temple servants, and all who had separated themselves from the inhabitants of the land for the sake of God’s Teachings. Their wives, sons, daughters, and everyone who is capable of understanding also took an oath. 
NEH.10.29	 They joined their relatives, the nobles, in binding themselves with a curse and an oath to follow God’s teachings given by Moses, God’s servant. They also bound themselves to follow all the commandments, rules, and regulations of the L
NEH.10.30	 We will not allow our daughters to marry the inhabitants of the land or allow their daughters to marry our sons. 
NEH.10.31	 If the inhabitants of the land bring merchandise or grain to sell on the day of worship, we won’t buy anything from them on the day of worship or any other holy day. During the seventh year, we won’t plant the fields or collect any debts.
NEH.10.32	 Also, we take upon ourselves the obligation to give an eighth of an ounce of silver every year for worship in our God’s temple: 
NEH.10.33	 for rows of the bread of the presence, and for the daily grain offerings and daily burnt offerings, on the weekly days of worship, and on the New Moon Festivals, and at the appointed annual festivals, for the holy gifts and offerings for sin that make peace with God for Israel, and for all the other work in the temple of our God.
NEH.10.34	 We priests, Levites, and laypeople have drawn lots to decide the order in which the heads of our families should bring wood to our God’s temple to burn on the altar of the L
NEH.10.35	 We have drawn lots to decide who should bring the first produce harvested and the first fruit from every tree each year to the L
NEH.10.36	 Following the directions in the Teachings, we have drawn lots to decide who should bring the firstborn of our sons, our cattle, and our flocks to the priests serving in our God’s temple. 
NEH.10.37	 Also, we have drawn lots to decide who should bring the best of our coarse flour, contributions, fruit from every tree, new wine, and olive oil to the priests, to the storerooms. We will bring for the Levites one-tenth of the produce from our fields, because the Levites are the ones who collect one-tenth of the produce from all our farm communities. 
NEH.10.38	 A priest—one of Aaron’s descendants—should be with the Levites when they collect the tenth. Then the Levites should bring one-tenth of these tenths to our God’s temple, into the rooms of the storehouses there. 
NEH.10.39	 The Israelites and the Levites should bring into the storerooms their contributions of grain, new wine, and olive oil. They should bring these products to the place where the utensils of the holy place are and where the priests who serve and the gatekeepers and the singers are. We won’t neglect our God’s temple.
NEH.11.1	 The leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem. The rest of the people drew lots to bring one out of every ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city. The remaining nine-tenths were supposed to live in the other cities. 
NEH.11.2	 The people blessed everyone who willingly offered to live in Jerusalem.
NEH.11.3	 These were the officials of the province who settled in Jerusalem. Some Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants, and descendants of Solomon’s servants settled in the cities of Judah. They lived on their own property in their own cities.
NEH.11.4	 Some of the descendants of Judah and of Benjamin settled in Jerusalem. The descendants of Judah were Athaiah, who was the son of Uzziah, who was the son of Zechariah, who was the son of Amariah, who was the son of Shephatiah, who was the son of Mahalalel, who was the son of Perez; 
NEH.11.5	 Maaseiah was the son of Baruch, who was the son of Col Hozeh, who was the son of Hazaiah, who was the son of Adaiah, who was the son of Joiarib, who was the son of Zechariah, who was the son of Shiloni. 
NEH.11.6	 All the descendants of Perez who settled in Jerusalem were 468 outstanding men. 
NEH.11.7	 These are the descendants of Benjamin: Sallu, who was the son of Meshullam, who was the son of Joed, who was the son of Pedaiah, who was the son of Kolaiah, who was the son of Maaseiah, who was the son of Ithiel, who was the son of Jeshaiah, 
NEH.11.8	 and after him, Gabbai ⌊and⌋ Sallai. ⌊The number of Benjamin’s descendants⌋ totaled 928. 
NEH.11.9	 Joel, son of Zichri, was in charge, and Judah, son of Senuah, was second-in-command over the city.
NEH.11.10	 These were the priests: Jedaiah (son of Joiarib), Jachin, 
NEH.11.11	 Seraiah, who was the son of Hilkiah, who was the son of Meshullam, who was the son of Zadok, who was the son of Meraioth, who was the son of Ahitub, who was the supervisor of God’s temple. 
NEH.11.12	 From Seraiah’s relatives 822 did the work in the temple. Also, Adaiah worked in the temple. He was the son of Jeroham, who was the son of Pelaliah, who was the son of Amzi, who was the son of Zechariah, who was the son of Pashhur, who was the son of Malchiah. 
NEH.11.13	 Adaiah’s relatives, the heads of the families, totaled 242. Amashsai was the son of Azarel, who was the son of Ahzai, who was the son of Meshillemoth, who was the son of Immer. 
NEH.11.14	 Their relatives, who were warriors, totaled 128. The man in charge of them was Zabdiel, son of Haggedolim.
NEH.11.15	 These were the Levites: Shemaiah who was the son of Hasshub, who was the son of Azrikam, who was the son of Hashabiah, who was the son of Bunni. 
NEH.11.16	 Shabbethai and Jozabad, Levite leaders, who were in charge of the work outside God’s temple. 
NEH.11.17	 Mattaniah was the son of Mica, who was the son of Zabdi, who was the son of Asaph, the leader who led the prayer of thanksgiving. The Levite leader Bakbukiah was the second-in-command among his relatives; and so was Abda who was the son of Shammua, who was the son of Galal, who was the son of Jeduthum. 
NEH.11.18	 All the Levites in the holy city totaled 284.
NEH.11.19	 These were the gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their relatives who guarded the gates totaled 172.
NEH.11.20	 The rest of the Israelites, priests, and Levites lived in all the cities of Judah. Everyone lived on his own inherited property. 
NEH.11.21	 But the temple servants lived on Mount Ophel with Ziha and Gishpa in charge of them.
NEH.11.22	 The man in charge of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi, who was the son of Bani, who was the son of Hashabiah, who was the son of Mattaniah, who was the son of Mica from Asaph’s descendants who were the singers in charge of worship in God’s temple. 
NEH.11.23	 They were under orders from the king, orders that determined which duties they should perform day by day. 
NEH.11.24	 Pethahiah, son of Meshezabel, one of the descendants of Zerah, Judah’s son, was the king’s adviser on all matters concerning the people.
NEH.11.25	 Many people lived in villages that had fields. Some people of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its villages, in Dibon and its villages, in Jekabzeel and its villages, 
NEH.11.26	 in Jeshua, Moladah, and Beth Pelet, 
NEH.11.27	 in Hazar Shual, in Beersheba and its villages, 
NEH.11.28	 in Ziklag, and in Meconah and its villages, 
NEH.11.29	 in En Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth, 
NEH.11.30	 Zanoah, and Adullam and their villages, in Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah and its villages. So they settled in the land from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom.
NEH.11.31	 Benjamin’s descendants live in the area of Geba, in Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its villages, 
NEH.11.32	 in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 
NEH.11.33	 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 
NEH.11.34	 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 
NEH.11.35	 Lod, Ono, and in the valley of the Craftsmen. 
NEH.11.36	 Some divisions of Levites in Judah were assigned to Benjamin.
NEH.12.1	 These are the priests and Levites who came back with Zerubbabel (Shealtiel’s son) and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 
NEH.12.2	 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 
NEH.12.3	 Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 
NEH.12.4	 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, 
NEH.12.5	 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 
NEH.12.6	 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, 
NEH.12.7	 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and of their relatives at the time of Jeshua.
NEH.12.8	 The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his relatives was in charge of the thanksgiving hymns. 
NEH.12.9	 Their relatives Bakbukiah and Unno stood across from them in worship.
NEH.12.10	 Jeshua was the father of Joiakim. Joiakim was the father of Eliashib. Eliashib was the father of Joiada. 
NEH.12.11	 Joiada was the father of Jonathan. Jonathan was the father of Jaddua.
NEH.12.12	 At the time of Joiakim, these were the priests who were the leaders of their families: From Seraiah, Meraiah; from Jeremiah, Hananiah; 
NEH.12.13	 from Ezra, Meshullam; from Amariah, Jehohanan; 
NEH.12.14	 from Malluchi, Jonathan; from Shebaniah, Joseph; 
NEH.12.15	 from Harim, Adna; from Meraioth, Helkai; 
NEH.12.16	 from Iddo, Zechariah; from Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
NEH.12.17	 from Abijah, Zichri; from Miniamin, from Moadiah, Piltai; 
NEH.12.18	 from Bilgah, Shammua; from Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
NEH.12.19	 from Joiarib, Mattenai; from Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
NEH.12.20	 from Sallai, Kallai; from Amok, Eber; 
NEH.12.21	 from Hilkiah, Hashabiah; from Jedaiah, Nethanel.
NEH.12.22	 ⌊The names of⌋ the family heads of the Levites and the priests at the time of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were recorded until the reign of Darius the Persian. 
NEH.12.23	 ⌊The names of⌋ the family heads of the Levites were recorded in the Book of Chronicles until the time of Johanan, grandson of Eliashib. 
NEH.12.24	 The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua (son of Kadmiel). They and their relatives stood in groups across from one another to sing hymns of praise and thanksgiving antiphonally as David, the man of God, had ordered. 
NEH.12.25	 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers standing guard at the storehouses by the gates. 
NEH.12.26	 They lived in the days of Joiakim, son of Jeshua, grandson of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe.
NEH.12.27	 When the wall of Jerusalem was going to be dedicated, they went to wherever the Levites lived and had them come to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication joyfully with hymns of thanksgiving, with songs and cymbals, and with harps and lyres. 
NEH.12.28	 So the groups of singers came together from the countryside around Jerusalem, from the villages of Netophah, 
NEH.12.29	 from Beth Gilgal, and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth. The singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	 The priests and the Levites cleansed themselves. Then they cleansed the people, the gates, and the wall.
NEH.12.31	 Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on the wall, and I arranged two large choirs to give thanks and march in procession. One choir went to the right on the wall to Dung Gate. 
NEH.12.32	 Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them. 
NEH.12.33	 Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah also followed. 
NEH.12.35	 So did some priests with trumpets: Zechariah, who was the son of Jonathan, who was the son of Shemaiah, who was the son of Mattaniah, who was the son of Micaiah, who was the son of Zaccur, who was the son of Asaph. 
NEH.12.36	 Also, these relatives of Zechariah followed: Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani with the musical instruments of David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe led them. 
NEH.12.37	 At Fountain Gate they went straight up the stairs of the City of David. There the wall rises past David’s palace and reaches Water Gate on the east.
NEH.12.38	 The other choir went to the left. I followed them with the other half of the people. We walked on the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens, as far as Broad Wall, 
NEH.12.39	 then past Ephraim Gate, over Old Gate and Fish Gate, and by the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as Sheep Gate. The choir stopped at Guard’s Gate. 
NEH.12.40	 So both choirs stood in God’s temple, as did I and the half of the leaders who were with me. 
NEH.12.41	 Likewise, these priests stood in God’s temple: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah with trumpets, 
NEH.12.42	 and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchiah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang under the direction of Jezrahiah.
NEH.12.43	 That day they offered many sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them reason to rejoice. The women and children rejoiced as well. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard from far away.
NEH.12.44	 On that day men were put in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, the first produce harvested, and a tenth of the people’s money. They stored in those rooms the gifts designated by Moses’ Teachings for the priests and Levites from the fields around the cities. The people of Judah were pleased with the ministry of the priests and Levites. 
NEH.12.45	 They were doing what their God required, what needed to be done for cleansing. The singers and the gatekeepers did what David and his son Solomon had ordered them to do. 
NEH.12.46	 Long ago in the time of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the singers to lead ⌊in singing⌋ the songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God. 
NEH.12.47	 At the time of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all the Israelites were giving gifts for the daily support of the singers and the gatekeepers. They set aside holy gifts for ⌊the daily support of⌋ the Levites, and the Levites set aside holy gifts for support of Aaron’s descendants.
NEH.13.1	 On that day the Book of Moses was read while the people were listening. They heard the passage that no Ammon ite or Moabite should ever be admitted into God’s assembly. 
NEH.13.2	 (After all, they didn’t welcome the Israelites with food and water. Instead, they hired Balaam to curse the Israelites. But our God turned the curse into a blessing.) 
NEH.13.3	 After the people heard this Teaching, they separated the non-Israelites from the Israelites.
NEH.13.4	 Even before this, the priest Eliashib, who was related to Tobiah and had been put in charge of the storerooms of our God’s temple, 
NEH.13.5	 had provided a large room for Tobiah. Previously, this room had been used to store grain offerings, incense, utensils, a tenth of all the grain harvested, new wine, and olive oil. These things belonged by law to the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers. The contributions for the priests had also been stored there.
NEH.13.6	 While all of this was taking place, I wasn’t in Jerusalem. In the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes’ reign in Babylon, I returned to the king. Later, I asked the king for permission to return. 
NEH.13.7	 I went to Jerusalem and discovered the evil thing Eliashib had done by providing Tobiah with a room in God’s temple. 
NEH.13.8	 I was furious. So I threw all of Tobiah’s household goods out of the room. 
NEH.13.9	 Then I told them to cleanse the rooms, and I put back in there the utensils from God’s temple, the offerings, and the incense.
NEH.13.10	 I learned that the Levites had not been given their portions. So each of the Levites and singers, who conducted the worship ⌊in the temple⌋, had left for their own fields. 
NEH.13.11	 I reprimanded the leaders. “Why is God’s temple being neglected?” I asked. So I brought the Levites back together and put them back in their places of service. 
NEH.13.12	 Then all Judah brought a tenth of all the grain harvested, new wine, and olive oil to the storerooms. 
NEH.13.13	 I appointed the following men to be in charge of the storerooms: Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah the Levite, and I appointed Hanan, son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah to help them. Since they could be trusted, I made them responsible for distributing ⌊the portions⌋ to their relatives.
NEH.13.14	 ⌊Nehemiah prayed,⌋ “Remember me for what I have done, my God, and don’t wipe out the good things that I have done for your temple and for the worship that is held there.”
NEH.13.15	 In those days I saw people in Judah stomping grapes in the winepresses on the day of worship. I saw them bringing in loads of wine, grapes, figs, and every other kind of load. They piled the loads on donkeys and brought them into Jerusalem on the day of worship. I warned them about selling food on that day. 
NEH.13.16	 People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of goods. They were selling them on the day of worship to the people of Judah, even in Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.17	 I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and asked them, “What is this evil thing you’re doing? How dare you treat the day of worship as unholy! 
NEH.13.18	 Isn’t this what your ancestors did, with the results that our God brought all these evils on us and on this city? Now you’re making him even more angry with Israel by treating the day of worship as unholy.”
NEH.13.19	 Before the day of worship, when the gates of Jerusalem were cleared of traffic, I ordered the doors to be shut and not to be reopened until after the day of worship. I stationed some of my men by the gates to make sure that no loads could be brought in on the day of worship. 
NEH.13.20	 Once or twice merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.21	 I warned them. “Why are you spending the night in front of the wall?” I asked them. “If you do it again, I’ll arrest you.” After that, they no longer came on the day of worship. 
NEH.13.22	 Then I told the Levites to cleanse themselves and guard the gates to keep the day of worship holy.
NEH.13.22	⌊Nehemiah prayed,⌋ “Remember me also for this, my God, and spare me, since you are very kind.”
NEH.13.23	 In those days I saw some Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 
NEH.13.24	 Half their children spoke the language of Ashdod or one of the other languages, but they couldn’t understand the language of Judah well enough to speak it. 
NEH.13.25	 So I reprimanded those Jews, cursed them, beat some of them, and pulled out their hair. I made them swear by God: “We won’t allow our daughters to marry their sons, and we won’t allow their daughters to marry us or our sons.” 
NEH.13.26	 I said, “Wasn’t it because of marriages like these that King Solomon of Israel sinned? There wasn’t a king like him among all nations. God loved him, and God made him king of all Israel. But his non-Israelite wives led him to sin. 
NEH.13.27	 Should we follow your example, commit such a serious crime against our God, and be unfaithful to him by marrying non-Israelite women?”
NEH.13.28	 Even one of Joiada’s sons was a son-in-law of Sanballat from Beth Horon. (Joiada was the son of the chief priest Eliashib.) I chased Joiada’s son away from me.
NEH.13.29	 ⌊Nehemiah prayed,⌋ “Remember them, my God, because they have contaminated the priestly office and the promise 
NEH.13.30	 So I cleansed them from everything that was foreign. I assigned duties to the priests and Levites. Each one had his own assignment. 
NEH.13.31	 I also arranged for delivering wood at regular times and for bringing the first produce to be harvested.
NEH.13.31	⌊Nehemiah prayed,⌋ “Remember me, my God, for my benefit.”
EST.1.1	 In the days of Xerxes the following events took place. This was the same Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Sudan. 
EST.1.2	 At the time when King Xerxes sat on the royal throne in the fortress of Susa, 
EST.1.3	 he held a banquet in the third year of his reign. The banquet was for all his officials and advisers, that is, the military officers of the Persians and Medes, the nobles and officials of the provinces who had access to him. 
EST.1.4	 He showed them the enormous wealth of his kingdom and the costly splendor of his greatness for many days, 180 to be exact. 
EST.1.5	 When those days were over, the king held a banquet lasting seven days. This banquet was held in the enclosed garden of the king’s palace for all people in the fortress of Susa, whatever their rank.
EST.1.6	 The garden had white and violet linen curtains. These curtains were attached to silver rods and marble pillars by cords made of white and purple fine linen. Gold and silver couches were on a mosaic pavement of purple rock, white marble, pearl-like stone, and black marble. 
EST.1.7	 People drank from golden cups. No two cups were alike. The king also provided plenty of royal wine out of his royal generosity. 
EST.1.8	 The drinking followed this rule: Drink as you please. (The king had ordered all the waiters in his palace to let everyone do as he pleased.)
EST.1.9	 Queen Vashti also held a banquet for the women at the royal palace of King Xerxes.
EST.1.10	 On the seventh day when the king was drunk on wine, he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who served under King Xerxes, 
EST.1.11	 to bring Queen Vashti in front of the king, wearing her royal crown. He wanted to show the people, especially the officials, her beauty, because she was very attractive. 
EST.1.12	 But Queen Vashti refused the king’s command that the eunuchs delivered to her. As a result, the king became very angry, and his rage burned inside him.
EST.1.13	 Now, the king usually asked for advice from all the experts in royal decrees and decisions, 
EST.1.14	 from those closest to him—Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These seven officials of the Persians and Medes had access to the king and held the highest rank in the kingdom. The king asked these wise men who knew the times,
EST.1.15	 “According to the royal decrees, what must we do with Queen Vashti since she did not obey King Xerxes’ command, which the eunuchs delivered?”
EST.1.16	 Then Memucan spoke up in the presence of the king and the officials, “Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the officials and all the people in every province of King Xerxes. 
EST.1.17	 The news of what the queen has done will spread to all women, and they will despise their husbands. They will say, ‘King Xerxes ordered Queen Vashti to be brought to him, but she would not come.’ 
EST.1.18	 Today the wives of the officials in Persia and Media who have heard what the queen did will talk back to all the king’s officials. There will be contempt and short tempers. 
EST.1.19	 If it pleases you, Your Majesty, issue a royal decree. It should be recorded in the decrees of the Persians and Medes, never to be repealed, that Vashti may never again appear in front of King Xerxes. Furthermore, Your Majesty, you should give her royal position to another woman who is more worthy than she. 
EST.1.20	 When you issue your decree, your whole kingdom, great as it is, will hear it. Then all the wives will honor their husbands, regardless of their status.”
EST.1.21	 The king and his officials approved of this, and so the king did as Memucan suggested. 
EST.1.22	 He sent official documents to all the king’s provinces, to each province in its own script and to the people in each province in their own language: “Let every husband be the ruler in his own house and speak with authority.” 
EST.2.1	 Later, when King Xerxes got over his raging anger, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decided against her.
EST.2.2	 So the king’s personal staff said to him, “Search for attractive young virgins for the king. 
EST.2.3	 And appoint scouts in all the provinces of your kingdom to gather all the attractive young virgins and bring them to the fortress of Susa, to the women’s quarters. There, in the care of the king’s eunuch Hegai, the guardian of the women, they will have their beauty treatment. 
EST.2.4	 Then the young woman who pleases you, Your Majesty, will become queen instead of Vashti.”
EST.2.4	The king liked the suggestion, and so he did just that.
EST.2.5	 In the fortress of Susa there was a Jew from the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai. He was the son of Jair, the grandson of Shimei, and the great-grandson of Kish. 
EST.2.6	 (Kish had been taken captive from Jerusalem together with the others who had gone into exile along with Judah’s King Jehoiakin,
EST.2.7	 Mordecai had raised Hadassah, also known as Esther, his uncle’s daughter, because she was an orphan. The young woman had a beautiful figure and was very attractive. When her father and mother died, Mordecai adopted her as his own daughter.
EST.2.8	 When the king’s announcement and decree were heard, many young women were gathered together and brought to the fortress of Susa. They were placed in the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king’s palace and placed in the care of Hegai, the guardian of the women. 
EST.2.9	 The young woman pleased him and won his affection. So he immediately provided her with the beauty treatment, a daily supply of food, and seven suitable female servants from the king’s palace. Then he moved her and her servants to the best place in the women’s quarters.
EST.2.10	 Esther did not reveal her nationality or her family background, because Mordecai had ordered her not to. 
EST.2.11	 Every day Mordecai would walk back and forth in front of the courtyard of the women’s quarters to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.
EST.2.12	 Each young woman had her turn to go to King Xerxes after she had completed the required 12-month treatment for women. The time of beauty treatment was spent as follows: six months using oil of myrrh and six months using perfumes and other treatments for women.
EST.2.13	 After that, the young woman would go to the king. Anything she wanted to take with her from the women’s quarters to the king’s palace was given to her. 
EST.2.14	 She would go in the evening and come back in the morning to the other quarters for women. There she would be in the care of the king’s eunuch Shaashgaz, the guardian of the concubines.
EST.2.15	 (Esther was the daughter of Abihail, Mordecai’s uncle. Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter.)
EST.2.15	When Esther’s turn came to go to the king, she asked only for what the king’s eunuch Hegai, the guardian of the women, advised. Everyone who saw Esther liked her. 
EST.2.16	 So Esther was taken to King Xerxes in his royal palace in the month of Tebeth, the tenth month, in the seventh year of his reign.
EST.2.17	 Now, the king loved Esther more than all the other women and favored her over all the other virgins. So he put the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	 Then the king held a great banquet for Esther. He invited all his officials and his advisers. He also declared that day a holiday in the provinces, and he handed out gifts from his royal generosity.
EST.2.19	 When the virgins were gathered a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate. 
EST.2.20	 Esther still had not revealed her family background or nationality, as Mordecai had ordered her. Esther always did whatever Mordecai told her, as she did when she was a child.
EST.2.21	 In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the entrance, became angry and planned to kill King Xerxes. 
EST.2.22	 But Mordecai found out about it and informed Queen Esther. Then Esther told the king, on behalf of Mordecai. 
EST.2.23	 When the report was investigated and found to be true, the dead bodies of Bigthan and Teresh were hung on a pole. The matter was written up in the king’s presence in his official record of daily events.
EST.3.1	 Later, King Xerxes promoted Haman. (Haman was the son of Hammedatha and was from Agag.) He gave Haman a position higher in authority than all the other officials who were with him. 
EST.3.2	 All the king’s advisers were at the king’s gate, kneeling and bowing to Haman with their faces touching the ground, because the king had commanded it. But Mordecai would not kneel and bow to him.
EST.3.3	 Then the king’s advisers at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you ignore the king’s command?” 
EST.3.4	 Although they asked him day after day, he paid no attention to them. So they informed Haman to see if Mordecai’s actions would be tolerated, since Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew.
EST.3.5	 When Haman saw that Mordecai did not kneel and bow to him, Haman was infuriated. 
EST.3.6	 Because the king’s advisers had informed him about Mordecai’s nationality, he thought it beneath himself to kill only Mordecai. So Haman planned to wipe out Mordecai’s people—all the Jews in the entire kingdom of Xerxes.
EST.3.7	 In Xerxes’ twelfth year as king, 
EST.3.8	 Now, Haman told King Xerxes, “Your Majesty, there is a certain nationality scattered among—but separate from—the nationalities in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws differ from those of all other nationalities. They do not obey your decrees. So it is not in your interest to tolerate them, Your Majesty. 
EST.3.9	 If you approve, have the orders for their destruction be written. For this I will pay 750,000 pounds of silver to your treasurers to be put in your treasury.”
EST.3.10	 At that, the king removed his signet ring and gave it to Haman, the enemy of the Jews. (Haman was the son of Hammedatha and was from Agag.) 
EST.3.11	 The king told Haman, “You can keep your silver and do with the people whatever you like.”
EST.3.12	 On the thirteenth day of the first month the king’s scribes were summoned. All Haman’s orders were written to the king’s satraps, the governors of every province, and the officials of every people. They wrote to each province in its own script and to the people in each province in their own language. The orders were signed in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the king’s ring. 
EST.3.13	 Messengers were sent with official documents to all the king’s provinces. ⌊The people were ordered⌋ to wipe out, kill, and destroy all the Jews—young and old, women and children—on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. Their possessions were also to be seized. 
EST.3.14	 A copy of the document was made public in a decree to every province. All the people were to be ready for this day.
EST.3.15	 The messengers hurried out as the king told them. The decree was also issued at the fortress of Susa. So the king and Haman sat down to drink a toast, but the city of Susa was in turmoil.
EST.4.1	 When Mordecai found out about everything that had been done, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes. He went into the middle of the city and cried loudly and bitterly. 
EST.4.2	 He even went right up to the king’s gate. (No one could enter it wearing sackcloth.)
EST.4.3	 In every province touched by the king’s command and decree, the Jews went into mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing. Many put on sackcloth and ashes.
EST.4.4	 Esther’s servants and eunuchs came and informed her ⌊about Mordecai⌋. The queen was stunned. She sent clothing for Mordecai to put on in place of his sackcloth, but he refused to accept it. 
EST.4.5	 Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs appointed to serve her. She commanded him to go to Mordecai and find out what was going on and why.
EST.4.6	 So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the king’s gate. 
EST.4.7	 Mordecai informed him about everything that had happened to him. He told him the exact amount of silver that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasury to destroy the Jews. 
EST.4.8	 He also gave him a copy of the decree that was issued in Susa. The decree gave permission to exterminate the Jews. Hathach was supposed to show it to Esther to inform and command her to go to the king, beg him for mercy, and appeal to him for her people. 
EST.4.9	 So Hathach returned and told Esther what Mordecai had said.
EST.4.10	 Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to say to Mordecai, 
EST.4.11	 “All the king’s advisers and the people in the king’s provinces know that no one approaches the king in the throne room without being summoned. By law that person must be put to death. Only if the king holds out the golden scepter to him will he live. I, myself, have not been summoned to enter the king’s presence for 30 days now.” 
EST.4.12	 So Esther’s servants told Mordecai what Esther said.
EST.4.13	 Mordecai sent this answer back to Esther, “Do not imagine that just because you are in the king’s palace you will be any safer than all the rest of the Jews. 
EST.4.14	 The fact is, even if you remain silent now, someone else will help and rescue the Jews, but you and your relatives will die. And who knows, you may have gained your royal position for a time like this.”
EST.4.15	 Esther sent this reply back to Mordecai, 
EST.4.16	 “Assemble all the Jews in Susa. Fast for me: Do not eat or drink at all for three entire days. My servants and I will also fast. After that, I will go to the king, even if it is against a royal decree. If I die, I die.”
EST.4.17	 Mordecai did just as Esther had commanded him.
EST.5.1	 On the third day Esther put on her royal robes. She stood in the courtyard of the king’s palace, facing the king’s throne room. The king was sitting on the royal throne inside the palace, facing the entrance.
EST.5.2	 When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the entrance, she won his favor. So the king held out the golden scepter that was in his hand to Esther. Esther went up to him and touched the top of the scepter.
EST.5.3	 Then the king asked her, “What is troubling you, Queen Esther? What would you like? Even if it is up to half of the kingdom, it will be granted to you.”
EST.5.4	 So Esther answered, “If it pleases you, Your Majesty, come today with Haman to a dinner I have prepared for you.”
EST.5.5	 The king replied, “Bring Haman right away, and do whatever Esther asks.” So the king and Haman came to the dinner that Esther had prepared.
EST.5.6	 While they were drinking wine, the king asked Esther, “What is your request? It will be granted to you. What would you like? Even if it is up to half of the kingdom, it will be granted.”
EST.5.7	 Esther answered, “My request? What would I like? 
EST.5.8	 Your Majesty, come with Haman to a dinner I will prepare for you. And tomorrow I will answer you, Your Majesty. If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, Your Majesty, may you ⌊then⌋ grant my request and do what I would like.”
EST.5.9	 When Haman left that day, he was happy and feeling good. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king’s gate, neither getting up nor trembling in his presence, Haman was furious with Mordecai. 
EST.5.10	 However, Haman controlled himself. He went home and sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh.
EST.5.11	 Then Haman began to relate in detail to them how very rich he was, the many sons he had, and all about how the king promoted him to a position over the officials and the king’s advisers. 
EST.5.12	 Haman went on to say, “What’s more, Queen Esther allowed no one except me to come with the king to the dinner she had prepared. And again tomorrow I am her invited guest together with the king. 
EST.5.13	 Yet, all this is worth nothing to me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”
EST.5.14	 Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a pole set up, 75 feet high, and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai’s ⌊dead body⌋ hung on it. Then go with the king to the dinner in good spirits.”
EST.5.14	Haman liked the idea, so he had the pole set up.
EST.6.1	 That night the king could not sleep. So he told ⌊a servant⌋ to bring the official daily records, and they were read to the king. 
EST.6.2	 The records showed how Mordecai had informed him that Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the entrance, had plotted a rebellion against King Xerxes.
EST.6.3	 The king asked, “How did I reward and promote Mordecai for this?”
EST.6.3	The king’s personal staff replied, “Nothing was done for him.”
EST.6.4	 The king asked, “Who is in the courtyard?” At that moment, Haman came through the courtyard to the king’s palace to ask the king about hanging Mordecai on the pole he had prepared for him.
EST.6.5	 The king’s staff answered him, “Haman happens to be standing in the courtyard.”
EST.6.5	“Let him come in,” the king said.
EST.6.6	 So Haman came in. The king then asked him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to reward?”
EST.6.6	Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king wish to reward more than me?” 
EST.6.7	 So Haman told the king, “This is what should be done: 
EST.6.8	 ⌊The servants⌋ should bring a royal robe that the king has worn and a horse that the king has ridden, one that has a royal crest on its head. 
EST.6.9	 Give the robe and the horse to one of the king’s officials, who is a noble. Put the robe on the man whom the king wishes to reward and have him ride on the horse in the city square. The king’s servants are also to shout ahead of him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to reward.’ ”
EST.6.10	 The king told Haman, “Hurry, take the robe and the horse as you said. Do this for Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king’s gate. Do not omit anything you have said.”
EST.6.11	 So Haman took the robe and the horse. He put the robe on Mordecai and had him ride in the city square, shouting ahead of him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to reward.”
EST.6.12	 After that, Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried home. He was in despair and covered his head. 
EST.6.13	 There, Haman began to relate in detail to his wife Zeresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his counselors and his wife Zeresh told him, “You are starting to lose power to Mordecai. If Mordecai is of Jewish descent, you will never win out over him. He will certainly lead to your downfall.”
EST.6.14	 While they were still speaking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and quickly took Haman to the dinner Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	 So the king and Haman came to have dinner with Queen Esther. 
EST.7.2	 On the second day, while they were drinking wine, the king asked Esther, “What is your request, Queen Esther? It will be granted to you. And what would you like? Even if it is up to half of the kingdom, it will be granted.”
EST.7.3	 Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, Your Majesty, spare my life. That is my request. And spare the life of my people. That is what I ask for. 
EST.7.4	 You see, we—my people and I—have been sold so that we can be wiped out, killed, and destroyed. If our men and women had only been sold as slaves, I would have kept silent because the enemy is not worth troubling you about, Your Majesty.”
EST.7.5	 Then King Xerxes interrupted Queen Esther and said, “Who is this person? Where is the person who has dared to do this?”
EST.7.6	 Esther answered, “Our vicious enemy is this wicked man Haman!” Then Haman became panic-stricken in the presence of the king and queen.
EST.7.7	 The king was furious as he got up from dinner and went into the palace garden. But Haman stayed to beg Queen Esther for his life, because he saw that the king had a terrible end in mind for him. 
EST.7.8	 When the king returned from the palace garden to the palace dining room, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was lying. The king thought, “Is he even going to rape the queen while I’m in the palace?” Then the king passed sentence on him, and servants covered Haman’s face.
EST.7.9	 Harbona, one of the eunuchs present with the king, said, “What a coincidence! The 75-foot pole Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke up for the well-being of the king, is still standing at Haman’s house.”
EST.7.9	The king responded, “Hang him on it!” 
EST.7.10	 So servants hung Haman’s ⌊dead body⌋ on the very pole he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king got over his raging anger.
EST.8.1	 On that same day King Xerxes gave the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther. Also, Mordecai came to the king because Esther had told him how Mordecai was related to her. 
EST.8.2	 Then the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther put Mordecai in charge of Haman’s property.
EST.8.3	 Esther spoke again to the king. She fell down at his feet crying and begged him to have mercy and to undo the evil plot of Haman, who was from Agag, and his conspiracy against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	 The king held out his golden scepter to Esther, and Esther got up and stood in front of the king. 
EST.8.5	 She said, “Your Majesty, if it pleases you, and if I have found favor with you, if you consider my cause to be reasonable and if I am pleasing to you, cancel the official orders ⌊concerning⌋ the plot of Haman (who was the son of Hammedatha and was from Agag). He signed ⌊the order⌋ to destroy the Jews in all your provinces, Your Majesty. 
EST.8.6	 I cannot bear to see my people suffer such evil. And I simply cannot bear to see the destruction of my relatives.”
EST.8.7	 King Xerxes said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “I have given Haman’s property to Esther, and Haman’s ⌊dead body⌋ was hung on the pole because he tried to kill the Jews. 
EST.8.8	 You write what you think is best for the Jews in the king’s name. Seal it also with the king’s signet ring, because whatever is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be canceled.”
EST.8.9	 At that time on the twenty-third day of Sivan, the third month, the king’s scribes were summoned. What Mordecai had ordered was written to the Jews and to the satraps, governors, and officers of the 127 provinces from India to Sudan. It was written to each province in its own script, to each people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and their own language.
EST.8.10	 Mordecai wrote in King Xerxes’ name and sealed the official documents with the king’s signet ring. Then he sent them by messengers who rode special horses bred for speed. ⌊He wrote⌋ 
EST.8.11	 that the king had given permission for the Jews in every city to assemble, to defend themselves, to wipe out, to kill, and to destroy every armed force of the people and province that is hostile to them, even women and children, and to seize their goods. 
EST.8.12	 ⌊This was permitted⌋ on one day in all the provinces of King Xerxes, on the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month. 
EST.8.13	 The copy of the document was made public in a decree to every province for all people. On that day the Jews were to be ready to take revenge on their enemies.
EST.8.14	 The messengers rode the king’s fastest horses. They left quickly, in keeping with the king’s command. The decree was issued also in the fortress of Susa.
EST.8.15	 Mordecai went out from the presence of the king wearing the royal violet and white robe, a large gold crown, and a purple outer robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa cheered and rejoiced.
EST.8.16	 So the Jews were cheerful, happy, joyful, and successful. 
EST.8.17	 In every province and every city where the king’s message and decree arrived, the Jews were happy and joyful, feasting and enjoying a holiday. Then many common people pretended to be Jews because they were terrified of the Jews.
EST.9.1	 On the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month, the king’s command and decree were to be carried out. On that very day, when the enemies of the Jews expected to overpower them, the exact opposite happened: The Jews overpowered those who hated them.
EST.9.2	 The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes to kill those who were planning to harm them. No one could stand up against them, because all the people were terrified of them. 
EST.9.3	 All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and the king’s treasurers assisted the Jews because they were terrified of Mordecai. 
EST.9.4	 Mordecai was an important man in the king’s palace. Moreover, his reputation was spreading to all the provinces, since Mordecai was becoming more and more powerful.
EST.9.5	 Then with their swords, the Jews attacked all their enemies, killing them, destroying them, and doing whatever they pleased to those who hated them. 
EST.9.6	 In the fortress of Susa the Jews killed and wiped out 500 men. 
EST.9.7	 They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha. 
EST.9.10	 These were the ten sons of Haman, who was the son of Hammedatha and the enemy of the Jews. But the Jews did not seize any of their possessions.
EST.9.11	 On that day the number of those killed in the fortress of Susa was reported to the king. 
EST.9.12	 So the king said to Queen Esther, “In the fortress of Susa the Jews have killed and wiped out 500 men and Haman’s 10 sons. What must they have done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now, what is your request? It will be granted to you. And what else would you like? It, too, will be granted.”
EST.9.13	 Esther said, “If it pleases you, Your Majesty, allow the Jews in Susa to do tomorrow what was decreed for today. Let them hang Haman’s ten sons on poles.”
EST.9.14	 The king commanded this, issuing a decree in Susa. And so they hung Haman’s ten sons ⌊on poles⌋.
EST.9.15	 The Jews in Susa also assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed 300 men in Susa, but they did not seize any of their possessions. 
EST.9.16	 The other Jews who were in the king’s provinces had also assembled to defend and free themselves from their enemies. They killed 75,000 of those who hated them, but they did not seize any of their possessions. 
EST.9.17	 This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. On the fourteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and celebration. 
EST.9.18	 But the Jews in Susa had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth. They rested on the fifteenth and made it a day of feasting and celebration. 
EST.9.19	 That is why the Jews who live in the villages and in the unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a holiday for feasting and celebration. They also send gifts of food to one another.
EST.9.20	 Now, Mordecai wrote these things down and sent official letters to all the Jews in all the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far. 
EST.9.21	 He established the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar as days they must observe every year. 
EST.9.22	 They were to observe them just like the days when the Jews freed themselves from their enemies. In that month their grief turned to joy and their mourning into a holiday. He declared that these days are to be days for feasting and celebrating and for sending gifts of food to one another, especially gifts to the poor.
EST.9.23	 So the Jews accepted as tradition what they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them. 
EST.9.24	 It was because Haman, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them. (Haman was the son of Hammedatha and was from Agag.) Haman had the 
EST.9.25	 But when this came to the king’s attention, he ordered, in the well-known letter, that the evil plan Haman had plotted against the Jews should turn back on his own head. As a result, they hung Haman and his sons on poles.
EST.9.26	 So the Jews called these days Purim, based on the word 
EST.9.27	 the Jews established a tradition for themselves and their descendants and for anyone who would join them. The tradition was that a person should never fail to observe these two days every year, as they were described and at their appointed time. 
EST.9.28	 So these days must be remembered and observed in every age, family, province, and city. These days of Purim must not be ignored among the Jews, and the importance of these days must never be forgotten by the generations to come.
EST.9.29	 Abihail’s daughter Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority in order to establish with this second letter the well-known celebration of Purim. 
EST.9.30	 Mordecai sent official documents granting peace and security to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Xerxes. 
EST.9.31	 He did this in order to establish these days of Purim at the appointed time. Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther established them for themselves, as they had established for themselves and their descendants the practices of fasting with sadness. 
EST.9.32	 Esther’s command had established these practices of Purim, and they are written in a book.
EST.10.1	 King Xerxes levied a tax on the country and the islands of the sea. 
EST.10.2	 All his acts of power and might along with the whole account of the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king had promoted, are recorded in the history of the kings of the Medes and Persians. 
EST.10.3	 Mordecai the Jew was ranked second only to King Xerxes. He was greatly respected by, and popular with, all of the other Jews, since he provided for the good of his people and spoke for the welfare of his fellow Jews.
JOB.1.1	 A man named Job lived in Uz. He was a man of integrity: He was decent, he feared God, and he stayed away from evil. 
JOB.1.2	 He had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.1.3	 He owned 7,000 sheep and goats, 3,000 camels, 1,000 oxen, 500 donkeys, and a large number of servants. He was the most influential person in the Middle East.
JOB.1.4	 His sons used to go to each other’s homes, where they would have parties. (Each brother took his turn having a party.) They would send someone to invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
JOB.1.5	 When they finished having their parties, Job would send for them in order to cleanse them from sin. He would get up early in the morning and sacrifice burnt offerings for each of them. Job thought, “My children may have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Job offered sacrifices for them all the time.
JOB.1.6	 One day when the sons of God came to stand in front of the L
JOB.1.7	 The L
JOB.1.7	Satan answered the L
JOB.1.8	 The L
JOB.1.9	 Satan answered the L
JOB.1.10	 Haven’t you put a protective fence around him, his home, and everything he has? You have blessed everything he does. His cattle have spread out over the land. 
JOB.1.11	 But now stretch out your hand, and strike everything he has. I bet he’ll curse you to your face.”

JOB.1.12	Then Satan left the L
JOB.1.13	 One day when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s home, 
JOB.1.14	 a messenger came to Job. He said, “While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, 
JOB.1.15	 men from Sheba attacked. They took the livestock and massacred the servants. I’m the only one who has escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.16	 While he was still speaking, another ⌊messenger⌋ came and said, “A fire from God fell from heaven and completely burned your flocks and servants. I’m the only one who has escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.17	 While he was still speaking, another ⌊messenger⌋ came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three companies and made a raid on the camels. They took the camels and massacred the servants. I’m the only one who has escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.18	 While he was still speaking, another ⌊messenger⌋ came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine at their oldest brother’s home 
JOB.1.19	 when suddenly a great storm swept across the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It fell on the young people, and they died. I’m the only one who has escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.20	 Job stood up, tore his robe in grief, and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground and worshiped. 
JOB.1.21	 He said,
JOB.1.21	“Naked I came from my mother,
JOB.1.21	and naked I will return.
JOB.1.21	The L

JOB.2.7	 Satan left the L
JOB.2.8	 Job took a piece of broken pottery to scratch himself as he sat in the ashes.
JOB.2.9	 His wife asked him, “Are you still holding on to your principles? Curse God and die!”
JOB.2.10	 He said to her, “You’re talking like a godless fool. We accept the good that God gives us. Shouldn’t we also accept the bad?”
JOB.2.10	Through all this Job’s lips did not utter one sinful word.
JOB.2.11	 When Job’s three friends heard about all the terrible things that had happened to him, each of them came from his home—Eliphaz of Teman, Bildad of Shuah, Zophar of Naama. They had agreed they would go together to sympathize with Job and comfort him.
JOB.2.12	 When they saw him from a distance, they didn’t even recognize him. They cried out loud and wept, and each of them tore his own clothes in grief. They threw dust on their heads. 
JOB.2.13	 Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him because they saw that he was in such great pain.
JOB.3.1	 After all this, Job ⌊finally⌋ opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born. 
JOB.3.2	 Job said,
JOB.3.3	 “Scratch out the day I was born
JOB.3.3	and the night that said, ‘A boy has been conceived!’
JOB.3.4	 “That day—
JOB.3.4	let it be pitch-black.
JOB.3.4	Let God above not ⌊even⌋ care about it.
JOB.3.4	Let no light shine on it.
JOB.3.5	 Let the darkness and long shadows claim it as their own.
JOB.3.5	Let a dark cloud hang over it.
JOB.3.5	Let the gloom terrify it.
JOB.3.6	 “That night—
JOB.3.6	let the blackness take it away.
JOB.3.6	Let it not be included in the days of the year
JOB.3.6	or be numbered among the months.
JOB.3.7	 Let that night be empty.
JOB.3.7	Let no joyful singing be heard in it.
JOB.3.8	 Let those who curse the day 
JOB.3.8	(those who know how to wake up Leviathan
JOB.3.8	curse that night.
JOB.3.9	 Let its stars turn dark before dawn.
JOB.3.9	Let it hope for light and receive none.
JOB.3.9	Let it not see the first light of dawn
JOB.3.10	 because it did not shut the doors of the womb ⌊from which I came⌋
JOB.3.10	or hide my eyes from trouble.
JOB.3.11	 “Why didn’t I die as soon as I was born
JOB.3.11	and breathe my last breath when I came out of the womb?
JOB.3.12	 Why did knees welcome me?
JOB.3.12	Why did breasts let me nurse?
JOB.3.13	 Instead of being alive,
JOB.3.13	I would now be quietly lying down.
JOB.3.13	I would now be sleeping peacefully.
JOB.3.14	 I would be with the kings and the counselors of the world
JOB.3.14	who built for themselves ⌊what are now⌋ ruins.
JOB.3.15	 I would be with princes
JOB.3.15	who had gold,
JOB.3.15	who filled their homes with silver.
JOB.3.16	 I would be buried like a stillborn baby.
JOB.3.16	I would not exist.
JOB.3.16	I would be like infants who never saw the light.
JOB.3.17	 There the wicked stop their raging.
JOB.3.17	There the weary are able to rest.
JOB.3.18	 There the captives have no troubles at all.
JOB.3.18	There they do not hear the shouting of the slave driver.
JOB.3.19	 There ⌊you find⌋ both the unimportant and important people.
JOB.3.19	There the slave is free from his master.
JOB.3.20	 “Why give light to one in misery
JOB.3.20	and life to those who find it so bitter,
JOB.3.21	 to those who long for death but it never comes—
JOB.3.21	though they dig for it more than for buried treasure?
JOB.3.22	 They are ecstatic,
JOB.3.22	delighted to find the grave.
JOB.3.23	 Why give light to those whose paths have been hidden,
JOB.3.23	to those whom God has fenced in?
JOB.3.24	 “When my food is in front of me, I sigh.
JOB.3.24	I pour out my groaning like water.
JOB.3.25	 What I fear most overtakes me.
JOB.3.25	What I dread happens to me.
JOB.3.26	 I have no peace!
JOB.3.26	I have no quiet!
JOB.3.26	I have no rest!
JOB.3.26	And trouble keeps coming!”
JOB.4.1	 Then Eliphaz from Teman replied ⌊to Job⌋,
JOB.4.2	 “If someone tries to talk to you, will you become impatient?
JOB.4.2	But who can keep from talking?
JOB.4.3	 Certainly, you have instructed many people:
JOB.4.3	When hands were weak, you made them strong.
JOB.4.4	 When someone stumbled, you lifted him up with your words.
JOB.4.4	When knees were weak, you gave them strength.
JOB.4.5	 But trouble comes to you, and you’re impatient.
JOB.4.5	It touches you, and you panic.
JOB.4.6	 Doesn’t your fear of God give you confidence
JOB.4.6	and your lifetime of integrity give you hope?
JOB.4.7	 “Now think about this:
JOB.4.7	Which innocent person ⌊ever⌋ died ⌊an untimely death⌋?
JOB.4.7	Find me a decent person who has been destroyed.
JOB.4.8	 Whenever I saw those who plowed wickedness and planted misery,
JOB.4.8	they gathered its harvest.
JOB.4.9	 God destroys them with his breath
JOB.4.9	and kills them with a blast of his anger.
JOB.4.10	 Though the roar of the lion
JOB.4.10	and the growl of the ferocious lion ⌊is loud⌋,
JOB.4.10	the young lions have had their teeth knocked out.
JOB.4.11	 The old lions die without any prey ⌊to eat⌋,
JOB.4.11	and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
JOB.4.12	 “I was told something secretly
JOB.4.12	and heard something whispered in my ear.
JOB.4.13	 With disturbing thoughts from visions in the night,
JOB.4.13	when deep sleep falls on people,
JOB.4.14	 fear and trembling came over me,
JOB.4.14	and all my bones shook.
JOB.4.15	 A spirit passed in front of me.
JOB.4.15	It made my hair stand on end.
JOB.4.16	 Something stood there.
JOB.4.16	I couldn’t tell what it was.
JOB.4.16	A vague image was in front of my eyes.
JOB.4.16	I heard a soft voice:
JOB.4.17	 ‘Can ⌊any⌋ mortal be righteous to God?
JOB.4.17	Can ⌊any⌋ human being be pure to his maker?’
JOB.4.18	 “You see, God doesn’t trust his own servants,
JOB.4.18	and he accuses his angels of making mistakes.
JOB.4.19	 How much more will he accuse those who live in clay houses
JOB.4.19	that have their foundation in the dust.
JOB.4.19	Those houses can be crushed quicker than a moth!
JOB.4.20	 From morning to evening, they are shattered.
JOB.4.20	They will disappear forever without anyone paying attention.
JOB.4.21	 Haven’t the ropes of their tent been loosened?
JOB.4.21	Won’t they die without wisdom?
JOB.5.1	 “Cry out!
JOB.5.1	Is there anyone to answer you?
JOB.5.1	To which of the holy ones will you turn?
JOB.5.2	 Certainly, anger kills a stubborn fool,
JOB.5.2	and jealousy murders a gullible person.
JOB.5.3	 I have seen a stubborn fool take root,
JOB.5.3	but I quickly cursed his house.
JOB.5.4	 His children are far from help.
JOB.5.4	They are crushed at the city gate,
JOB.5.4	and no one is there to rescue them.
JOB.5.5	 What a stubborn fool gathers, hungry people eat.
JOB.5.5	They take it even from among the thorns,
JOB.5.5	and thirsty people pant after his wealth.
JOB.5.6	 Certainly, sorrow doesn’t come from the soil,
JOB.5.6	and trouble doesn’t sprout from the ground.
JOB.5.7	 But a person is born for trouble as surely as sparks fly up ⌊from a fire⌋.
JOB.5.8	 “But I would seek God’s help
JOB.5.8	and present my case to him.
JOB.5.9	 He does great things that ⌊we⌋ cannot understand
JOB.5.9	and miracles that ⌊we⌋ cannot count.
JOB.5.10	 He gives rain to the earth
JOB.5.10	and sends water to the fields.
JOB.5.11	 He places lowly people up high.
JOB.5.11	He lifts those who mourn to safety.
JOB.5.12	 He keeps shrewd people from carrying out their plans
JOB.5.12	so that they cannot do anything successfully.
JOB.5.13	 He catches the wise with their own tricks.
JOB.5.13	The plans of schemers prove to be hasty.
JOB.5.14	 In the daytime they meet darkness
JOB.5.14	and grope in the sunlight as if it were night.
JOB.5.15	 “But he saves ⌊other people⌋ from their slander
JOB.5.15	and the needy from the power of the mighty.
JOB.5.16	 Then the poor have hope
JOB.5.16	while wrongdoing shuts its mouth.
JOB.5.17	 “Blessed is the person whom God corrects.
JOB.5.17	That person should not despise discipline from the Almighty.
JOB.5.18	 God injures, but he bandages.
JOB.5.18	He beats you up, but his hands make you well.
JOB.5.19	 He will keep you safe from six troubles,
JOB.5.19	and when the seventh one comes, no harm will touch you:
JOB.5.20	 “In famine he will save you from death,
JOB.5.20	and in war he will save you from the sword.
JOB.5.21	 “When the tongue lashes out, you will be safe,
JOB.5.21	and you will not be afraid of destruction when it comes.
JOB.5.22	 “You will be able to laugh at destruction and starvation,
JOB.5.22	so do not be afraid of wild animals on the earth.
JOB.5.23	 “You will have a binding agreement with the stones in the field,
JOB.5.23	and wild animals will be at peace with you.
JOB.5.24	 “You will know peace in your tent.
JOB.5.24	You will inspect your house and find nothing missing.
JOB.5.25	 “You will find that your children are many
JOB.5.25	and your descendants are like the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	 “You will come to your grave at a ripe old age
JOB.5.26	like a stack of hay in the right season.
JOB.5.27	 “We have studied all of this thoroughly! This is the way it is.
JOB.5.27	Listen to it, and learn it for yourself.”
JOB.6.1	 Then Job replied ⌊to his friends⌋,
JOB.6.2	 “If only my grief could be weighed,
JOB.6.2	if only my misery could be laid on the scales with it,
JOB.6.3	 then they would be heavier than the sand of the seas.
JOB.6.3	I spoke carelessly
JOB.6.4	 because the arrows of the Almighty ⌊have found their target⌋ in me,
JOB.6.4	and my spirit is drinking their poison.
JOB.6.4	God’s terrors line up in battle against me.
JOB.6.5	 “Does a wild donkey bray when it’s ⌊eating⌋ grass,
JOB.6.5	or does an ox make a sound over its hay?
JOB.6.6	 Is tasteless food eaten without salt,
JOB.6.6	or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?
JOB.6.7	 I refuse to touch such things.
JOB.6.7	They are disgusting to me.
JOB.6.8	 “How I wish that my prayer would be answered—
JOB.6.8	that God would give me what I’m hoping for,
JOB.6.9	 that God would ⌊finally⌋ be willing to crush me,
JOB.6.9	that he would reach out to cut me off.
JOB.6.10	 Then I would still have comfort.
JOB.6.10	I would be happy despite my endless pain,
JOB.6.10	because I have not rejected the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	 What strength do I have ⌊left⌋ that I can go on hoping?
JOB.6.11	What goal do I have that I would want to prolong my life?
JOB.6.12	 Do I have the strength of rocks?
JOB.6.12	Does my body have the strength of bronze?
JOB.6.13	 Am I not completely helpless?
JOB.6.13	Haven’t my skills been taken away from me?
JOB.6.14	 “A friend should treat a troubled person kindly,
JOB.6.14	even if he abandons the fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	 My brothers have been as deceptive as seasonal rivers,
JOB.6.15	like the seasonal riverbeds that flood.
JOB.6.16	 They are dark with ice.
JOB.6.16	They are hidden by snow.
JOB.6.17	 They vanish during a scorching summer.
JOB.6.17	In the heat their riverbeds dry up.
JOB.6.18	 They change their course.
JOB.6.18	They go into a wasteland and disappear.
JOB.6.19	 Caravans from Tema look for them.
JOB.6.19	Travelers from Sheba search for them.
JOB.6.20	 They are ashamed because they relied on the streams.
JOB.6.20	Arriving there, they are disappointed.
JOB.6.21	 “So you are as unreliable to me ⌊as they are⌋.
JOB.6.21	You see something terrifying, and you are afraid.
JOB.6.22	 Did I ever say, ‘Give me a gift,’
JOB.6.22	or ‘Offer me a bribe from your wealth,’
JOB.6.23	 or ‘Rescue me from an enemy,’
JOB.6.23	or ‘Ransom me from a tyrant’?
JOB.6.24	 Teach me, and I’ll be silent.
JOB.6.24	Show me where I’ve been wrong.
JOB.6.25	 How painful an honest discussion can be!
JOB.6.25	In correcting me, you correct yourselves!
JOB.6.26	 Do you think my words need correction?
JOB.6.26	Do you think they’re what a desperate person says to the wind?
JOB.6.27	 Would you also throw dice for an orphan?
JOB.6.27	Would you buy and sell your friend?
JOB.6.28	 “But now, if you’re willing, look at me.
JOB.6.28	I won’t lie to your face.
JOB.6.29	 Please change your mind.
JOB.6.29	Don’t permit any injustice.
JOB.6.29	Change your mind because I am still right about this!
JOB.6.30	 Is there injustice on my tongue,
JOB.6.30	or is my mouth unable to tell the difference between right and wrong?
JOB.7.1	 “Isn’t a mortal’s stay on earth difficult
JOB.7.1	like a hired hand’s daily ⌊work⌋?
JOB.7.2	 Like a slave, he longs for shade.
JOB.7.2	Like a hired hand, he eagerly looks for his pay.
JOB.7.3	 Likewise, I have been given months that are of no use,
JOB.7.3	and I have inherited nights filled with misery.
JOB.7.4	 When I lie down, I ask,
JOB.7.4	‘When will I get up?’
JOB.7.4	But the evening is long,
JOB.7.4	and I’m exhausted from tossing about until dawn.
JOB.7.5	 My body is covered with maggots and scabs.
JOB.7.5	My skin is crusted over with sores; then they ooze.
JOB.7.6	 My days go swifter than a weaver’s shuttle.
JOB.7.6	They are spent without hope.
JOB.7.7	 Remember, my life is only a breath,
JOB.7.7	and never again will my eyes see anything good.
JOB.7.8	 The eye that watches over me will no longer see me.
JOB.7.8	Your eye will look for me, but I’ll be gone.
JOB.7.9	 As a cloud fades away and disappears,
JOB.7.9	so a person goes into the grave and doesn’t come back again.
JOB.7.10	 He doesn’t come back home again,
JOB.7.10	and his household doesn’t recognize him anymore.
JOB.7.11	 So I won’t keep my mouth shut,
JOB.7.11	but I will speak from the distress that is in my spirit
JOB.7.11	and complain about the bitterness in my soul.
JOB.7.12	 “Am I the sea or a sea monster
JOB.7.12	that you have set a guard over me?
JOB.7.13	 When I say,
JOB.7.13	‘My couch may give me comfort.
JOB.7.13	My bed may help me bear my pain,’
JOB.7.14	 then you frighten me with dreams
JOB.7.14	and terrify me with visions.
JOB.7.15	 My throat would rather be choked.
JOB.7.15	My body 
JOB.7.16	 I hate my life; I do not want to live forever.
JOB.7.16	Leave me alone because my days are so brief.
JOB.7.17	 “What is a mortal that you should make so much of him,
JOB.7.17	that you should be concerned about him?
JOB.7.18	 ⌊What is he⌋ that you should inspect him every morning
JOB.7.18	and examine him every moment?
JOB.7.19	 Why don’t you stop looking at me
JOB.7.19	long enough to let me swallow my spit?
JOB.7.20	 If I sin, what can I ⌊possibly⌋ do to you
JOB.7.20	since you insist on spying on people?
JOB.7.20	Why do you make me your target?
JOB.7.20	I’ve become a burden even to myself.
JOB.7.21	 Why don’t you forgive my disobedience
JOB.7.21	and take away my sin?
JOB.7.21	Soon I’ll lie down in the dust.
JOB.7.21	Then you will search for me, but I’ll be gone!”
JOB.8.1	 Then Bildad from Shuah replied ⌊to Job⌋,
JOB.8.2	 “How long will you say these things?
JOB.8.2	How long will your words be so windy?
JOB.8.3	 Does God distort justice,
JOB.8.3	or does the Almighty distort righteousness?
JOB.8.4	 If your children sinned against him,
JOB.8.4	he allowed them to suffer the consequences of their sinfulness.
JOB.8.5	 If you search for God
JOB.8.5	and plead for mercy from the Almighty,
JOB.8.6	 if you are moral and ethical,
JOB.8.6	then he will rise up on your behalf
JOB.8.6	and prove your righteousness by rebuilding your home.
JOB.8.7	 Then what you had in the past will seem small
JOB.8.7	compared with the great prosperity you’ll have in the future.
JOB.8.8	 “Ask the people of past generations.
JOB.8.8	Find out what their ancestors had learned.
JOB.8.9	 We have only been around since yesterday, and we know nothing.
JOB.8.9	Our days on earth are only a fleeting shadow.
JOB.8.10	 Won’t their words teach you?
JOB.8.10	Won’t they share their thoughts with you?
JOB.8.11	 “Can papyrus grow up where there is no swamp?
JOB.8.11	Can rushes grow tall without water?
JOB.8.12	 Even if they were fresh and not cut,
JOB.8.12	they would wither quicker than grass.
JOB.8.13	 The same thing happens to all who forget God.
JOB.8.13	The hope of the godless dies.
JOB.8.14	 His confidence is easily shattered.
JOB.8.14	His trust is a spider’s web.
JOB.8.15	 If one leans on his house, it collapses.
JOB.8.15	If one holds on to it, it will not support his weight.
JOB.8.16	 He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine.
JOB.8.16	The shoots spread over his garden.
JOB.8.17	 Its roots weave through a pile of stones.
JOB.8.17	They cling to a stone house.
JOB.8.18	 But when it is uprooted from its place,
JOB.8.18	⌊the ground⌋ denies it ⌊and says⌋, ‘I never saw you!’
JOB.8.19	 That is its joy in this life,
JOB.8.19	and others sprout from the same ground to ⌊take its place⌋.
JOB.8.20	 “Certainly, God does not reject a person of integrity
JOB.8.20	or give a helping hand to wicked people.
JOB.8.21	 He will fill your mouth with laughter
JOB.8.21	and your lips with happy shouting.
JOB.8.22	 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,
JOB.8.22	and the tent of the wicked will cease to exist.”
JOB.9.1	 Then Job replied ⌊to his friends⌋,
JOB.9.2	 “Yes, I know that this is true.
JOB.9.2	But how can a mortal be declared righteous to God?
JOB.9.3	 If he wished to debate with God,
JOB.9.3	he wouldn’t be able to answer one question in a thousand.
JOB.9.4	 “God is wise in heart and mighty in power.
JOB.9.4	Who could oppose him and win?
JOB.9.5	 He moves mountains without their knowing it,
JOB.9.5	and he topples them in his anger.
JOB.9.6	 He shakes the earth from its place,
JOB.9.6	and its pillars tremble.
JOB.9.7	 He commands the sun not to rise.
JOB.9.7	He doesn’t let the stars come out.
JOB.9.8	 He stretches out the heavens by himself
JOB.9.8	and walks on the waves of the sea.
JOB.9.9	 He made ⌊the constellations⌋ Ursa Major, Orion, and the Pleiades,
JOB.9.9	and the clusters of stars in the south.
JOB.9.10	 He does great things that are unsearchable
JOB.9.10	and miracles that cannot be numbered.
JOB.9.11	 He passes alongside of me, and I don’t even see him.
JOB.9.11	He goes past me, and I don’t even notice him.
JOB.9.12	 He takes something away, ⌊but⌋ who can stop him?
JOB.9.12	Who is going to ask him, ‘What are you doing?’
JOB.9.13	 God does not hold back his anger.
JOB.9.13	Even Rahab’s
JOB.9.14	 “How can I possibly answer God?
JOB.9.14	How can I find the right words ⌊to speak⌋ with him?
JOB.9.15	 Even if I were right, I could not answer ⌊him⌋.
JOB.9.15	I would have to plead for mercy from my judge.
JOB.9.16	 If I cried out and he answered me,
JOB.9.16	I do not believe that he would listen to me.
JOB.9.17	 He would knock me down with a storm
JOB.9.17	and bruise me without a reason.
JOB.9.18	 He would not let me catch my breath.
JOB.9.18	He fills me with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	 If it is a matter of strength,
JOB.9.19	then he is the mighty one.
JOB.9.19	If it is about justice,
JOB.9.19	who will charge me with a crime?
JOB.9.20	 If I am righteous, my own mouth would condemn me.
JOB.9.20	It would declare that I am corrupt even if I am a man of integrity.
JOB.9.21	 If I am a man of integrity, I have no way of knowing it.
JOB.9.21	I hate my life!
JOB.9.22	 It is all the same.
JOB.9.22	That is why I say,
JOB.9.22	‘He destroys ⌊both⌋ the man of integrity and the wicked.’
JOB.9.23	 When a sudden disaster brings death,
JOB.9.23	he makes fun of the despair of innocent people.
JOB.9.24	 The earth is handed over to the wicked.
JOB.9.24	He covers the faces of its judges.
JOB.9.24	If he isn’t the one ⌊doing this⌋, who is?
JOB.9.25	 “My days go by more quickly than a runner.
JOB.9.25	They sprint away.
JOB.9.25	They don’t see anything good.
JOB.9.26	 They pass by quickly like boats made from reeds,
JOB.9.26	like an eagle swooping down on its prey.
JOB.9.27	 ⌊Even⌋ if I say, ‘I will forget my complaining;
JOB.9.27	I will change my expression and smile,’
JOB.9.28	 I ⌊still⌋ dread everything I must suffer.
JOB.9.28	I know that you won’t declare me innocent.
JOB.9.29	 I’ve already been found guilty.
JOB.9.29	Why should I work so hard for nothing?
JOB.9.30	 If I wash myself with lye soap
JOB.9.30	and cleanse my hands with bleach,
JOB.9.31	 then you would plunge me into a muddy pit,
JOB.9.31	and my own clothes would find me disgusting.
JOB.9.32	 A human like me cannot answer God,
JOB.9.32	‘Let’s take our case to court.’
JOB.9.33	 There is no mediator between us
JOB.9.33	to put his hand on both of us.
JOB.9.34	 God should take his rod away from me,
JOB.9.34	and he should not terrify me.
JOB.9.35	 Then I would speak and not be afraid of him.
JOB.9.35	But I know that I am not like that.
JOB.10.1	 “I hate my life.
JOB.10.1	I will freely express my complaint.
JOB.10.1	I will speak as bitterly as I feel.
JOB.10.2	 I will say to God,
JOB.10.2	‘Don’t condemn me.
JOB.10.2	Let me know why you are quarreling with me.
JOB.10.3	 What do you gain by mistreating me,
JOB.10.3	by rejecting the work of your hands
JOB.10.3	while you favor the plans of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	 Do you actually have human eyes?
JOB.10.4	Do you see as a mortal sees?
JOB.10.5	 Are your days like a mortal’s days?
JOB.10.5	Are your years like a human’s years?
JOB.10.6	 Is that why you look for guilt in me
JOB.10.6	and search for sin in me?
JOB.10.7	 You know I’m not guilty,
JOB.10.7	but there is no one to rescue me from your hands.
JOB.10.8	 “‘Your hands formed me and made every part of me,
JOB.10.8	then you turned to destroy me.
JOB.10.9	 Please remember that you made me out of clay
JOB.10.9	and that you will return me to the dust again.
JOB.10.10	 Didn’t you pour me out like milk
JOB.10.10	and curdle me like cheese?
JOB.10.11	 Didn’t you dress me in skin and flesh
JOB.10.11	and weave me together with bones and tendons?
JOB.10.12	 You gave me life and mercy.
JOB.10.12	Your watchfulness has preserved my spirit.
JOB.10.13	 But in your heart you hid these things.
JOB.10.13	I know this is what you did.
JOB.10.14	 “‘If I sin, you watch me
JOB.10.14	and will not free me from my guilt.
JOB.10.15	 How terrible it will be for me if I’m guilty!
JOB.10.15	Even if I’m righteous, I dare not lift up my head.
JOB.10.15	I am filled with disgrace
JOB.10.15	while I look on my misery.
JOB.10.16	 Like a proud, ferocious lion you hunt me down.
JOB.10.16	You keep working your miracles against me.
JOB.10.17	 You keep finding new witnesses against me.
JOB.10.17	You keep increasing your anger toward me.
JOB.10.17	You keep bringing new armies against me.
JOB.10.18	 “‘Why did you take me out of the womb?
JOB.10.18	I wish I had breathed my last breath
JOB.10.18	before anyone had laid eyes on me.
JOB.10.19	 Then it would be as if I had never existed,
JOB.10.19	as if I had been carried from the womb to the tomb.
JOB.10.20	 “‘Isn’t my life short enough?
JOB.10.20	So stop ⌊this⌋, and leave me alone.
JOB.10.20	Let me smile a little
JOB.10.21	 before I go away
JOB.10.21	to a land of darkness and gloom,
JOB.10.22	 to a dismal land of long shadows and confusion
JOB.10.22	where light is as bright as darkness.
JOB.10.22	I’ll never return.’ ”
JOB.11.1	 Then Zophar from Naama replied ⌊to Job⌋,
JOB.11.2	 “Shouldn’t someone answer this flood of words?
JOB.11.2	Should a good public speaker be acquitted?
JOB.11.3	 Should your empty talk silence others
JOB.11.3	so that you can make fun of us without any shame?
JOB.11.4	 You say, ‘My teaching is morally correct,’
JOB.11.4	and, ‘As you can see, I’m innocent.’
JOB.11.5	 I only wish God would speak
JOB.11.5	and open his mouth ⌊to talk⌋ to you.
JOB.11.6	 He would tell you the secrets of wisdom,
JOB.11.6	because ⌊true⌋ wisdom is twice ⌊as great as your wisdom⌋,
JOB.11.6	and you would know that God forgets your sin.
JOB.11.7	 “Can you discover God’s hidden secrets,
JOB.11.7	or are you able to find the Almighty’s limits?
JOB.11.8	 ⌊God’s wisdom is⌋ higher than heaven.
JOB.11.8	What can you do?
JOB.11.8	It is deeper than ⌊the depths⌋ of hell.
JOB.11.8	What can you know?
JOB.11.9	 It is longer than the earth
JOB.11.9	and wider than the sea.
JOB.11.10	 If God comes along and imprisons ⌊someone⌋
JOB.11.10	and then calls a court into session, who can stop him?
JOB.11.11	 He knows who the scoundrels are.
JOB.11.11	And when he sees sin, doesn’t he pay attention to it?
JOB.11.12	 But an empty-headed person will gain understanding
JOB.11.12	when a wild donkey is born tame.
JOB.11.13	 “If you want to set your heart right,
JOB.11.13	then pray to him.
JOB.11.14	 If you’re holding on to sin, put it far away,
JOB.11.14	and don’t let injustice live in your tent.
JOB.11.15	 Then you will be able to show your face without being ashamed,
JOB.11.15	and you will be secure and unafraid.
JOB.11.16	 ⌊Then⌋ you will forget your misery
JOB.11.16	and remember it like water that has flowed downstream.
JOB.11.17	 Then your life will be brighter than the noonday sun.
JOB.11.17	The darkness in your life will become like morning.
JOB.11.18	 You will feel confident because there’s hope,
JOB.11.18	and you will look around and rest in safety.
JOB.11.19	 You will lie down with no one to frighten you,
JOB.11.19	and many people will try to gain your favor.
JOB.11.20	 But the wicked will lose their eyesight.
JOB.11.20	Their escape route will be closed.
JOB.11.20	Their only hope is to take their last breath.”
JOB.12.1	 Then Job replied ⌊to his friends⌋,
JOB.12.2	 “You certainly are ⌊wise⌋ people,
JOB.12.2	and when you die, wisdom will die.
JOB.12.3	 Like you, I have a mind.
JOB.12.3	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.12.3	But who doesn’t know these things?
JOB.12.4	 I am a laughingstock to my neighbors.
JOB.12.4	I am one who calls on God and expects an answer.
JOB.12.4	A man of integrity, a man who is righteous, has become a laughingstock.
JOB.12.5	 “A person who has an easy life has no appreciation for misfortune.
JOB.12.5	He thinks it is the fate of those who slip up.
JOB.12.6	 ⌊But⌋ robbers’ tents are prosperous,
JOB.12.6	and there is security for those who provoke God,
JOB.12.6	for those whose god is their power.
JOB.12.7	 “Instead, ask the animals, and they will teach you.
JOB.12.7	Ask the birds, and they will tell you.
JOB.12.8	 Or speak with the earth, and it will teach you.
JOB.12.8	Even the fish will relate ⌊the story⌋ to you.
JOB.12.9	 What creature doesn’t know that the L
JOB.12.10	 The life of every living creature
JOB.12.10	and the spirit in every human body are in his hands.
JOB.12.11	 Doesn’t the ear distinguish sounds
JOB.12.11	and the tongue taste food?
JOB.12.12	 “Wisdom is with the ancient one.
JOB.12.12	The one who has had many days has insight.
JOB.12.13	 God has wisdom and strength.
JOB.12.13	Advice and insight are his.
JOB.12.14	 When he tears ⌊something⌋ down, it cannot be rebuilt.
JOB.12.14	When he puts someone in prison, that person cannot be freed.
JOB.12.15	 When he holds back the waters, there is a drought.
JOB.12.15	When he releases them, they flood the earth.
JOB.12.16	 “God has power and priceless wisdom.
JOB.12.16	He owns ⌊both⌋ the deceiver and the person who is deceived.
JOB.12.17	 He leads counselors away barefoot
JOB.12.17	and makes fools out of judges.
JOB.12.18	 He loosens kings’ belts
JOB.12.18	and strips them of their pants.
JOB.12.19	 He leads priests away barefoot
JOB.12.19	and misleads those who serve in a temple.
JOB.12.20	 He makes trusted advisers unable to speak
JOB.12.20	and takes away the good judgment of respected leaders.
JOB.12.21	 He pours contempt on influential people
JOB.12.21	and unbuckles the belt of the mighty.
JOB.12.22	 He uncovers mysteries ⌊hidden⌋ in the darkness
JOB.12.22	and brings gloom into the light.
JOB.12.23	 He makes nations important and then destroys them.
JOB.12.23	He makes nations large and leads them away.
JOB.12.24	 He takes away the common sense of a country’s leaders
JOB.12.24	and makes them stumble about in a pathless wilderness.
JOB.12.25	 They grope in the dark with no light,
JOB.12.25	and he makes them stumble like drunks.
JOB.13.1	 “My eye has certainly seen all of this!
JOB.13.1	My ear has heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	 After all, I know it as well as you do.
JOB.13.2	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.13.3	 However, I want to speak to the Almighty,
JOB.13.3	and I wish to argue my case in front of God.
JOB.13.4	 But you are smearing me with lies.
JOB.13.4	All of you are worthless physicians.
JOB.13.5	 I wish you would keep silent.
JOB.13.5	For you, that would be wisdom.
JOB.13.6	 Please listen to my argument,
JOB.13.6	and pay attention to my plea.
JOB.13.7	 “Will you talk wickedly for God
JOB.13.7	and talk deceitfully on his behalf?
JOB.13.8	 Will you favor him
JOB.13.8	⌊as⌋ if you were arguing in court on God’s behalf?
JOB.13.9	 Will it go well when he cross-examines you?
JOB.13.9	Will you try to trick him as one mortal tricks another?
JOB.13.10	 Will he really defend you
JOB.13.10	if you secretly favor ⌊him⌋?
JOB.13.11	 Doesn’t his majesty terrify you?
JOB.13.11	Doesn’t the fear of him fall upon you?
JOB.13.12	 “Your recollections are worthless proverbs.
JOB.13.12	Your answers are absolutely useless.
JOB.13.13	 Be quiet, because I want to speak.
JOB.13.13	Let whatever may happen to me ⌊happen⌋!
JOB.13.14	 I am biting off more than I can chew
JOB.13.14	and taking my life in my own hands.
JOB.13.15	 If God would kill me, I would have no hope ⌊left⌋.
JOB.13.15	Nevertheless, I will defend my behavior to his face.
JOB.13.16	 This also will be my salvation
JOB.13.16	because no godless person could face him.
JOB.13.17	 “Listen carefully to my words.
JOB.13.17	Hear my declaration.
JOB.13.18	 I have prepared my case.
JOB.13.18	I know that I will be declared righteous.
JOB.13.19	 Who can make a case against me?
JOB.13.19	If someone could, I’d be silent and die.
JOB.13.20	 “Please don’t do two things to me

JOB.13.21	 Stop oppressing me.
JOB.13.21	Don’t let your terror frighten me.
JOB.13.22	 Then call, and I’ll answer.
JOB.13.22	Otherwise, I’ll speak, and you’ll answer me.
JOB.13.23	 How many crimes and sins have I committed?
JOB.13.23	Make me aware of my disobedience and my sin.
JOB.13.24	 Why do you hide your face ⌊from me⌋ and consider me your enemy?
JOB.13.25	 Are you trying to make a fluttering leaf tremble
JOB.13.25	or trying to chase dry husks?
JOB.13.26	 You write down bitter accusations against me.
JOB.13.26	You make me suffer for the sins of my youth.
JOB.13.27	 You put my feet in shackles.
JOB.13.27	You follow my trail by engraving marks on the soles of my feet.
JOB.13.28	 I am like worn-out wineskins,
JOB.13.28	like moth-eaten clothes.
JOB.14.1	 “A person who is born of a woman is short-lived
JOB.14.1	and is full of trouble.
JOB.14.2	 He comes up like a flower; then he withers.
JOB.14.2	He is like a fleeting shadow; he doesn’t stay long.
JOB.14.3	 You observe this
JOB.14.3	and call me to account to you.
JOB.14.4	 “If only an unclean person could become clean!
JOB.14.4	It’s not possible.
JOB.14.5	 If the number of his days
JOB.14.5	and the number of his months are determined by you,
JOB.14.5	and you set his limit,
JOB.14.5	then he cannot go past it.
JOB.14.6	 Look away from him, and he will cease to be.
JOB.14.6	Meanwhile, he loves life as a laborer loves work.
JOB.14.7	 There is hope for a tree when it is cut down.
JOB.14.7	It will sprout again.
JOB.14.7	Its shoots will not stop sprouting.
JOB.14.8	 If its roots grow old in the ground
JOB.14.8	and its stump dies in the soil,
JOB.14.9	 merely a scent of water will make it sprout
JOB.14.9	and grow branches like a plant.
JOB.14.10	 But a human dies and is powerless.
JOB.14.10	A person breathes his last breath, and where is he?
JOB.14.11	 ⌊As⌋ water drains out of a lake,
JOB.14.11	or ⌊as⌋ a river dries up completely,
JOB.14.12	 so each person lies down
JOB.14.12	and does not rise until the heavens cease to exist.
JOB.14.12	He does not wake up.
JOB.14.12	He is not awakened from his sleep.
JOB.14.13	 I wish you would hide me in Sheol
JOB.14.13	and keep me hidden there until your anger cools.
JOB.14.13	Set a specific time for me when you will remember me.
JOB.14.14	 “If a person dies, will he go on living?
JOB.14.14	I will wait for my relief to come
JOB.14.14	as long as my hard labor continues.
JOB.14.15	 You will call, and I will answer you.
JOB.14.15	You will long for the person your hands have made.
JOB.14.16	 Though now you count my steps,
JOB.14.16	you will not keep ⌊a record of⌋ my sins.
JOB.14.17	 My disobedience will be closed up in a bag,
JOB.14.17	and you will cover over my sins.
JOB.14.18	 As surely as a mountain falls
JOB.14.18	and rocks are dislodged,
JOB.14.19	 ⌊so⌋ water wears away stone,
JOB.14.19	floods wash away soil from the land,
JOB.14.19	and you destroy a mortal’s hope.
JOB.14.20	 You overpower him forever, and he passes away.
JOB.14.20	You change his appearance and send him away.
JOB.14.21	 His sons are honored, and he doesn’t know it.
JOB.14.21	Or they become unimportant, and he doesn’t realize it.
JOB.14.22	 He feels only his body’s pain.
JOB.14.22	He is only worried about himself.”
JOB.15.1	 Then Eliphaz from Teman replied ⌊to Job⌋,
JOB.15.2	 “Should a wise person answer with endless details
JOB.15.2	and fill his stomach with the east wind?
JOB.15.3	 Should he argue with words that don’t help,

JOB.15.4	 Yes, you destroy the fear ⌊of God⌋
JOB.15.4	and diminish devotion to God.
JOB.15.5	 Your sin teaches you what to say.
JOB.15.5	You choose ⌊to talk with⌋ a sly tongue.
JOB.15.6	 Your ⌊own⌋ mouth condemns you, not I.
JOB.15.6	Your lips testify against you.
JOB.15.7	 “Were you the first human to be born?
JOB.15.7	Were you delivered before the hills ⌊existed⌋?

JOB.15.9	 What do you know that we don’t know?
JOB.15.9	What do you understand that we don’t?
JOB.15.10	 Both the old and the gray-haired are among us.
JOB.15.10	They are older than your father.
JOB.15.11	 Isn’t God’s comfort enough for you,
JOB.15.11	even when gently spoken to you?
JOB.15.12	 Why have your emotions carried you away?
JOB.15.12	Why do your eyes flash
JOB.15.13	 when you turn against God
JOB.15.13	and spit these words out of your mouth?
JOB.15.14	 Why should a mortal be considered faultless
JOB.15.14	or someone born of a woman be considered righteous?
JOB.15.15	 If God doesn’t trust his holy ones,
JOB.15.15	and the heavens are not pure in his sight,
JOB.15.16	 how much less will he trust the one who is disgusting and corrupt,
JOB.15.16	the one who drinks wickedness like water.
JOB.15.17	 “I’ll tell you; listen to me!
JOB.15.17	I’ll relate what I have seen.
JOB.15.18	 I’ll tell you what wise people have declared
JOB.15.18	and what was not kept secret from their ancestors.
JOB.15.19	 (The land was given to them alone,
JOB.15.19	and no stranger passed through their land.)
JOB.15.20	 “The wicked person is tortured all his days.
JOB.15.20	Only a few years are reserved for the ruthless person.
JOB.15.21	 Terrifying sounds are in his ears.
JOB.15.21	While he enjoys peace, the destroyer comes to him.
JOB.15.22	 He doesn’t believe he’ll return from the dark.
JOB.15.22	He is destined ⌊to be killed⌋ with a sword.
JOB.15.23	 He wanders around for food and asks, ‘Where is it?’
JOB.15.23	He knows that his ruin is close at hand.
JOB.15.24	 “The day of darkness
JOB.15.24	Distress and anguish terrify him
JOB.15.24	like a king ready for battle.
JOB.15.25	 He stretches out his hand against God
JOB.15.25	and attacks the Almighty like a warrior.
JOB.15.26	 He stubbornly charges at him with a thick shield.
JOB.15.27	 “His face is bloated with fat,
JOB.15.27	and he is fat around the waist.
JOB.15.28	 He lives in ruined cities
JOB.15.28	where no one dwells,
JOB.15.28	in houses that are doomed to be piles of rubble.
JOB.15.29	 He won’t get rich,
JOB.15.29	and his wealth won’t last.
JOB.15.29	His possessions won’t spread out over the land.
JOB.15.30	 “He won’t escape the darkness.
JOB.15.30	A flame will shrivel his branches.
JOB.15.30	He will be blown away by his own breath.
JOB.15.31	 He shouldn’t trust in worthless things and deceive himself
JOB.15.31	because he will get worthless things in return.
JOB.15.32	 It will happen before his time has come,
JOB.15.32	and his branch will not become green.
JOB.15.33	 He will drop his unripened grapes like a vine
JOB.15.33	and throw off his blossoms like an olive tree
JOB.15.34	 because a mob of godless people produces nothing,
JOB.15.34	and fire burns up the tents of those who offer bribes.
JOB.15.35	 They conceive trouble and give birth to evil.
JOB.15.35	Their wombs produce deception.”
JOB.16.1	 Then Job replied ⌊to his friends⌋,
JOB.16.2	 “I have heard many things like this before.
JOB.16.2	You are all pathetic at comforting me.

JOB.16.3	What disturbs you that you keep on answering ⌊me⌋?
JOB.16.4	 I, too, could speak like you

JOB.16.4	I could string words together against you
JOB.16.4	and shake my head at you.
JOB.16.5	 I could encourage you with my mouth,

JOB.16.6	 If I speak, my pain is not eased.
JOB.16.6	If I stop talking, how much of it will go away?
JOB.16.7	 “But now, God has worn me out.
JOB.16.7	You, ⌊God,⌋ have destroyed everyone who supports me.

JOB.16.9	 “God’s anger tore me ⌊apart⌋ and attacked me.
JOB.16.9	He gritted his teeth at me.
JOB.16.9	My opponent looked sharply at me.
JOB.16.10	 People gaped at me with wide-open mouths.
JOB.16.10	In scorn they slapped my cheeks.
JOB.16.10	They united against me.
JOB.16.11	 God handed me over to unjust people
JOB.16.11	and threw me into the hands of wicked people.
JOB.16.12	 I was at ease, and he shattered me.
JOB.16.12	He grabbed me by the back of the neck and smashed ⌊my skull⌋.
JOB.16.12	He set me up as his target,
JOB.16.13	 and his archers surrounded me.
JOB.16.13	He slashes open my kidneys without mercy
JOB.16.13	and spills my blood
JOB.16.14	 He inflicts wound after wound on me.
JOB.16.14	He lunges at me like a warrior.
JOB.16.15	 “I have sewn sackcloth over my skin,

JOB.16.20	 the spokesman for my thoughts.
JOB.16.20	My eyes drip ⌊with tears⌋ to God
JOB.16.22	 because in a few short years I will take the path of no return.
JOB.16.21	 But my witness will plead for a human in front of God.
JOB.16.21	The Son of Man will plead for his friend!
JOB.17.1	 “My spirit is broken.
JOB.17.1	My days have been snuffed out.
JOB.17.1	The cemetery ⌊is waiting⌋ for me.
JOB.17.2	 Certainly, mockers are around me.

JOB.17.3	 Please guarantee my bail yourself.
JOB.17.3	Who else will guarantee it with a handshake?
JOB.17.4	 You have closed their minds so that they cannot understand.
JOB.17.4	That is why you will not honor them.
JOB.17.5	 (Whoever turns in friends to get their property

JOB.17.6	 “Now he has made me a laughingstock for many people.

JOB.17.7	Now all my limbs are like a shadow.
JOB.17.8	 Decent people are shocked by this,
JOB.17.8	and it stirs up the innocent against godless people.
JOB.17.9	 Yet, the righteous person clings to his way,
JOB.17.9	and the one with clean hands grows stronger.
JOB.17.10	 “But now, all of you, come and try again!
JOB.17.10	I won’t find one wise man among you.
JOB.17.11	 My days are passing by.
JOB.17.11	My plans are broken.
JOB.17.11	My dreams ⌊are shattered⌋.
JOB.17.12	 You say that night is day.
JOB.17.12	Light has nearly become darkness.
JOB.17.13	 If I look for the grave as my home
JOB.17.13	and make my bed in the darkness,
JOB.17.14	 if I say to the pit, ‘You are my father,’
JOB.17.14	and to the worm, ‘You are my mother and sister,’
JOB.17.15	 then where is my hope?
JOB.17.15	Can you see any hope left in me?
JOB.17.16	 Will hope go down with me to the gates of the grave?
JOB.17.16	Will my hope rest with me in the dust?”
JOB.18.1	 Then Bildad from Shuah replied ⌊to Job⌋,
JOB.18.2	 “How long before your words will end?
JOB.18.2	Think it through, and then we’ll talk.
JOB.18.3	 Why do you think of us as cattle?
JOB.18.3	Why are we considered stupid in your eyes?
JOB.18.4	 Why do you rip yourself apart in anger?
JOB.18.4	Should the earth be abandoned for your sake
JOB.18.4	or a boulder be dislodged?
JOB.18.5	 “Indeed, the light of the wicked is snuffed out.
JOB.18.5	The flame of his fire stops glowing.
JOB.18.6	 The light in his tent becomes dark,
JOB.18.6	and the lamp above him is snuffed out.
JOB.18.7	 “His healthy stride is shortened,
JOB.18.7	and his own planning trips him up.
JOB.18.8	 His own feet get him tangled in a net
JOB.18.8	as he walks around on its webbing.
JOB.18.9	 A trap catches his heel.
JOB.18.9	A snare holds him.
JOB.18.10	 A rope is hidden on the ground for him.
JOB.18.10	A trap is on his path ⌊to catch⌋ him.
JOB.18.11	 “Terrors suddenly pounce on him from every side
JOB.18.11	and chase him every step he takes.
JOB.18.12	 Hunger undermines his strength.
JOB.18.12	Disaster is waiting beside him.
JOB.18.13	 His skin is eaten away by disease.
JOB.18.13	Death’s firstborn son eats away at the limbs of his body.
JOB.18.14	 He is dragged from the safety of his tent
JOB.18.14	and marched off to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	 Fire lives in his tent.
JOB.18.15	Sulfur is scattered over his home.
JOB.18.16	 His roots dry up under him.
JOB.18.16	His branches wither over him.
JOB.18.17	 All memory about him will vanish from the earth,
JOB.18.17	and his reputation will not be known on the street corner.
JOB.18.18	 He will be driven from the light into the dark
JOB.18.18	and chased out of the world.
JOB.18.19	 He will not have any children or descendants among his people
JOB.18.19	or any survivor where he used to live.
JOB.18.20	 People in the west are shocked by what happens to him.
JOB.18.20	People in the east are seized with horror.
JOB.18.21	 This is what happens to the homes of wicked people
JOB.18.21	and to those who do not know God.”
JOB.19.1	 Then Job replied ⌊to his friends⌋,
JOB.19.2	 “How long will you torment me
JOB.19.2	and depress me with words?
JOB.19.3	 You have insulted me ten times now.
JOB.19.3	You’re not even ashamed of mistreating me.
JOB.19.4	 Even if it were true that I’ve made a mistake without realizing it,
JOB.19.4	my mistake would affect only me.
JOB.19.5	 If you are trying to make yourselves look better than me
JOB.19.5	by using my disgrace as an argument against me,
JOB.19.6	 then I want you to know that God has wronged me
JOB.19.6	and surrounded me with his net.
JOB.19.7	 Indeed, I cry, ‘Help! I’m being attacked!’ but I get no response.
JOB.19.7	I call for help, but there is no justice.
JOB.19.8	 “God has blocked my path so that I can’t go on.
JOB.19.8	He has made my paths dark.
JOB.19.9	 He has stripped me of my honor.
JOB.19.9	He has taken the crown off my head.
JOB.19.10	 He beats me down on every side until I’m gone.
JOB.19.10	He uproots my hope like a tree.
JOB.19.11	 He is very angry at me.
JOB.19.11	He considers me to be his enemy.
JOB.19.12	 His troops assemble against me.
JOB.19.12	They build a ramp to attack me
JOB.19.12	and camp around my tent.
JOB.19.13	 “My brothers stay far away from me.
JOB.19.13	My friends are complete strangers to me.
JOB.19.14	 My relatives and my closest friends have stopped coming.
JOB.19.14	My house guests have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	 My female slaves consider me to be a stranger.
JOB.19.15	I am like a foreigner to them.
JOB.19.16	 I call my slave, but he doesn’t answer, though I beg him.
JOB.19.17	 My breath offends my wife.
JOB.19.17	I stink to my own children.
JOB.19.18	 Even young children despise me.
JOB.19.18	If I stand up, they make fun of me.
JOB.19.19	 All my closest friends are disgusted with me.
JOB.19.19	Those I love have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	 I am skin and bones,
JOB.19.20	and I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	 “Have pity on me, my friends!
JOB.19.21	Have pity on me because God’s hand has struck me down.
JOB.19.22	 Why do you pursue me as God does?
JOB.19.22	Why are you never satisfied with my flesh?
JOB.19.23	 “I wish now my words were written.
JOB.19.23	I wish they were inscribed on a scroll.
JOB.19.24	 I wish they were forever engraved on a rock
JOB.19.24	with an iron stylus and lead.
JOB.19.25	 But I know that my defender lives,
JOB.19.25	and afterwards, he will rise on the earth.
JOB.19.26	 Even after my skin has been stripped off my body,
JOB.19.26	I will see God in my own flesh.
JOB.19.27	 I will see him with my own eyes,
JOB.19.27	not with someone else’s.
JOB.19.27	My heart fails inside me!
JOB.19.28	 “You say,
JOB.19.28	‘We will persecute him!
JOB.19.28	The root of the problem is found in him.’
JOB.19.29	 Fear death,
JOB.19.29	because ⌊your anger⌋ is punishable by death.
JOB.19.29	Then you will know there is a judge.”
JOB.20.1	 Then Zophar from Naama replied ⌊to Job⌋,
JOB.20.2	 “My disturbing thoughts make me answer,
JOB.20.2	and because of them I am upset.
JOB.20.3	 I have heard criticism that makes me ashamed,
JOB.20.3	but a spirit beyond my understanding gives me answers.
JOB.20.4	 “Don’t you know
JOB.20.4	that from ancient times,
JOB.20.4	from the time humans were placed on earth,
JOB.20.5	 the triumph of the wicked is short-lived,
JOB.20.5	and the joy of the godless person lasts only a moment?
JOB.20.6	 If his height reaches to the sky
JOB.20.6	and his head touches the clouds,
JOB.20.7	 he will certainly rot
JOB.20.7	Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
JOB.20.8	 He will fly away like a dream and not be found.
JOB.20.8	He will be chased away like a vision in the night.
JOB.20.9	 Eyes that saw him will see him no more.
JOB.20.9	His home will not look at him again.
JOB.20.10	 His children will have to ask the poor for help.
JOB.20.10	His own hands will have to give back his wealth.
JOB.20.11	 His bones, once full of youthful vigor,
JOB.20.11	will lie down with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	 “Though evil is sweet in his mouth
JOB.20.12	and he hides it under his tongue. . . .
JOB.20.13	 Though he savors it and won’t let go of it
JOB.20.13	and he holds it on the roof of his mouth,
JOB.20.14	 the food in his belly turns sour.
JOB.20.14	It becomes snake venom in his stomach.
JOB.20.15	 He vomits up the riches that he swallowed.
JOB.20.15	God forces them out of his stomach.
JOB.20.16	 The godless person sucks the poison of snakes.
JOB.20.16	A viper’s fang kills him.
JOB.20.17	 He won’t be able to drink from the streams
JOB.20.17	or from the rivers of honey and buttermilk.
JOB.20.18	 He will give back what he earned without enjoying it.
JOB.20.18	He will get no joy from the profits of his business
JOB.20.19	 because he crushed and abandoned the poor.
JOB.20.19	He has taken by force a house that he didn’t build.
JOB.20.20	 He will never know peace in his heart.
JOB.20.20	He will never allow anything he desires to escape ⌊his grasp⌋.
JOB.20.21	 “Nothing is left for him to eat.
JOB.20.21	His prosperity won’t last.
JOB.20.22	 ⌊Even⌋ with all his wealth
JOB.20.22	the full force of misery comes down on him.
JOB.20.23	 Let that misery fill his belly.
JOB.20.23	⌊God⌋ throws his burning anger at the godless person
JOB.20.23	and makes his wrath come down on him like rain.
JOB.20.24	 If that person flees from an iron weapon,
JOB.20.24	a bronze bow will pierce him.
JOB.20.25	 He pulls it out, and it comes out of his back.
JOB.20.25	The glittering point comes out of his gallbladder.
JOB.20.25	“Terrors come quickly to the godless person:
JOB.20.26	 Total darkness waits in hiding for his treasure.
JOB.20.26	A fire that no one fans will burn him.
JOB.20.26	Whatever is left in his tent will be devoured.
JOB.20.27	 Heaven exposes his sin.
JOB.20.27	Earth rises up against him.
JOB.20.28	 A flood will sweep away his house,
JOB.20.28	a flash flood on the day of his anger.
JOB.20.29	 This is the reward God gives to the wicked person,
JOB.20.29	the inheritance God has appointed for him.”
JOB.21.1	 Then Job replied ⌊to his friends⌋,
JOB.21.2	 “Listen carefully to my words,
JOB.21.2	and let that be the comfort you offer me.
JOB.21.3	 Bear with me while I speak.
JOB.21.3	Then after I’ve spoken, you may go on mocking.
JOB.21.4	 Am I complaining about a person?
JOB.21.4	Why shouldn’t I be impatient?
JOB.21.5	 Look at me, and be shocked,
JOB.21.5	and put ⌊your⌋ hand over ⌊your⌋ mouth.
JOB.21.6	 When I remember it, I’m terrified,
JOB.21.6	and shuddering seizes my body.
JOB.21.7	 “Why do the wicked go on living, grow old,
JOB.21.7	and even become more powerful?
JOB.21.8	 They see their children firmly established with them,
JOB.21.8	and they get to see their descendants.
JOB.21.9	 Their homes are free from fear,
JOB.21.9	and God doesn’t use his rod on them.
JOB.21.10	 Their bulls are fertile when they breed.
JOB.21.10	Their cows give birth to calves and never miscarry.
JOB.21.11	 They send their little children out ⌊to play⌋
JOB.21.11	like a flock of lambs,
JOB.21.11	and their children dance around.
JOB.21.12	 They sing with the tambourine and lyre,
JOB.21.12	and they are happy with the music of the flute.
JOB.21.13	 They spend their days in happiness,
JOB.21.13	and they go peacefully to the grave.
JOB.21.14	 But they say to God,
JOB.21.14	‘Leave us alone.
JOB.21.14	We don’t want to know your ways.
JOB.21.15	 Who is the Almighty that we should serve him?
JOB.21.15	What do we gain if we pray to him?’
JOB.21.16	 Anyhow, isn’t their happiness in their own power?
JOB.21.16	(The plan of the wicked is foreign to my way of thinking.)
JOB.21.17	 “How often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out?
JOB.21.17	How often does disaster happen to them?
JOB.21.17	How often does an angry God give them pain?
JOB.21.18	 How often are they like straw in the wind
JOB.21.18	or like husks that the storm sweeps away?
JOB.21.19	 “⌊You say,⌋ ‘God saves a person’s punishment for his children.’
JOB.21.19	God should pay back that person
JOB.21.19	so that he would know that it is a punishment.
JOB.21.20	 His eyes should see his own ruin.
JOB.21.20	He should drink from the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	 How can he be interested in his family after he’s gone,
JOB.21.21	when the number of his months is cut short?
JOB.21.22	 “Can anyone teach God knowledge?
JOB.21.22	Can anyone judge the Most High?
JOB.21.23	 One person dies in his prime
JOB.21.23	and feels altogether happy and contented.
JOB.21.24	 His stomach is full of milk,
JOB.21.24	and his bones are strong and healthy.
JOB.21.25	 Another person, never having tasted happiness,
JOB.21.25	dies with a bitter soul.
JOB.21.26	 Together they lie down in the dust,
JOB.21.26	and worms cover them.
JOB.21.27	 “You see, I know your thoughts
JOB.21.27	and the schemes you plot against me
JOB.21.28	 because you ask,
JOB.21.28	‘Where is the house of the influential person?
JOB.21.28	Where is the tent where wicked people live?’
JOB.21.29	 Haven’t you asked travelers?
JOB.21.29	But you didn’t pay attention to their directions.
JOB.21.30	 On the day of disaster the wicked person is spared.
JOB.21.30	On the day of ⌊God’s⌋ anger he is rescued.
JOB.21.31	 Who will tell him to his face how he lived?
JOB.21.31	Who will pay him back for what he did?
JOB.21.32	 He is carried to the cemetery,
JOB.21.32	and his grave is guarded.
JOB.21.33	 The soil in the creekbed is sweet to him.
JOB.21.33	Everyone follows him.
JOB.21.33	Countless others went before him.
JOB.21.34	 How can you comfort me with this nonsense
JOB.21.34	when your answers continue to betray me?”
JOB.22.1	 Then Eliphaz from Teman replied ⌊to Job⌋,
JOB.22.2	 “Can a human be of any use to God
JOB.22.2	when even a wise person is only useful to himself?
JOB.22.3	 Is the Almighty pleased when you are righteous?
JOB.22.3	Does he gain anything when you follow the path of integrity?
JOB.22.4	 Does God correct you
JOB.22.4	and bring you into a court of law because you fear him?
JOB.22.5	 “Aren’t you really very wicked?
JOB.22.5	Is there no end to your wrongdoing?
JOB.22.6	 For no reason you take your brothers’ goods as security for a loan
JOB.22.6	and strip them of their clothes.
JOB.22.7	 You don’t even give a tired person a drink of water,
JOB.22.7	and you take food away from hungry people.
JOB.22.8	 A strong person owns the land.
JOB.22.8	A privileged person lives in it.
JOB.22.9	 You send widows away empty-handed,
JOB.22.9	and the arms of orphans are broken.
JOB.22.10	 That is why traps are all around you
JOB.22.10	and great fear suddenly grips you.
JOB.22.11	 ⌊That is why⌋ darkness surrounds you and you cannot see
JOB.22.11	and a flood of water covers you.
JOB.22.12	 “Isn’t God high above in the heavens?
JOB.22.12	Look how high the highest stars are!
JOB.22.13	 You ask, ‘What does God know?
JOB.22.13	Can he judge ⌊anything⌋ from behind a dark cloud?
JOB.22.14	 Thick clouds surround him so that he cannot see.
JOB.22.14	He walks above the clouds.’
JOB.22.15	 “Are you following the old path that wicked people have taken?
JOB.22.16	 They are snatched up before their time.
JOB.22.16	A river washes their foundation away.
JOB.22.17	 They told God, ‘Leave us alone!
JOB.22.17	What can the Almighty do for us?’
JOB.22.18	 Yet, he filled their homes with good things.
JOB.22.18	(The plan of the wicked is foreign to my way of thinking.)
JOB.22.19	 The righteous saw it and were glad,
JOB.22.19	and the innocent made fun of them by saying,
JOB.22.20	 ‘Indeed, their wealth has been wiped out,
JOB.22.20	and a fire has burned up what ⌊little⌋ they had left.’
JOB.22.21	 “Be in harmony and at peace with God.
JOB.22.21	In this way you will have prosperity.
JOB.22.22	 Accept instruction from his mouth,
JOB.22.22	and keep his words in your heart.
JOB.22.23	 If you return to the Almighty, you will prosper.
JOB.22.23	If you put wrongdoing out of your tent,
JOB.22.24	 and lay your gold down in the dust,
JOB.22.24	and put your gold from Ophir among the pebbles in the rivers,
JOB.22.25	 then the Almighty will become your gold
JOB.22.25	and your large supply of silver.
JOB.22.26	 Then you will be happy with the Almighty
JOB.22.26	and look up toward God.
JOB.22.27	 You will pray to him, and he will listen to you,
JOB.22.27	and you will keep your vow to him.
JOB.22.28	 When you promise to do something, you will succeed,
JOB.22.28	and light will shine on your path.
JOB.22.29	 When others are discouraged, you will say, ‘Cheer up!’
JOB.22.29	Then he will save the humble person.
JOB.22.30	 He will rescue one who is not innocent.
JOB.22.30	That person will be rescued by your purity.”
JOB.23.1	 Then Job replied ⌊to his friends⌋,
JOB.23.2	 “My complaint is bitter again today.
JOB.23.2	I try hard to control my sighing.
JOB.23.3	 “If only I knew where I could find God!
JOB.23.3	I would go where he lives.
JOB.23.4	 I would present ⌊my⌋ case to him.
JOB.23.4	I would have a mouthful of arguments.
JOB.23.5	 I want to know the words he would use to answer me.
JOB.23.5	I want to understand the things he would say to me.
JOB.23.6	 Would he sue me and hide behind great legal maneuvers?
JOB.23.6	No, he certainly would press charges against me.
JOB.23.7	 Then decent people could argue with him,
JOB.23.7	and I would escape my judgment forever.
JOB.23.8	 However, if I go east, he isn’t there.
JOB.23.8	If I go west, I can’t find him.
JOB.23.9	 If I go northward, where he is at work, I can’t observe him.
JOB.23.9	If I turn southward, I can’t see him.
JOB.23.10	 ⌊I can’t find him⌋ because he knows the road I take.
JOB.23.10	When he tests me,
JOB.23.10	I’ll come out as pure as gold.
JOB.23.11	 I have followed his footsteps closely.
JOB.23.11	I have stayed on his path and did not turn from it.
JOB.23.12	 I have not left his commands behind.
JOB.23.12	I have treasured his words in my heart.
JOB.23.13	 “But God is one of a kind.
JOB.23.13	Who can make him change his mind?
JOB.23.13	He does whatever he wants!
JOB.23.14	 He will carry out ⌊his⌋ orders concerning me
JOB.23.14	as he does with so many other things.
JOB.23.15	 That is why I’m terrified of him.
JOB.23.15	When I think of it, I’m afraid of him.
JOB.23.16	 God has discouraged me.
JOB.23.16	The Almighty has filled me with terror.
JOB.23.17	 But I am not silenced by the dark
JOB.23.17	or by the thick darkness that covers my face.
JOB.24.1	 “Why doesn’t the Almighty set aside times ⌊for punishment⌋?
JOB.24.1	Why don’t those who are close to him see his days ⌊of judgment⌋?
JOB.24.2	 “⌊People⌋ move boundary markers.
JOB.24.2	They steal flocks and tend them as shepherds.
JOB.24.3	 They drive away the orphan’s donkey.
JOB.24.3	They take the widow’s ox as security for a loan.
JOB.24.4	 They force needy people off the road.
JOB.24.4	All the poor people of the country go into hiding.
JOB.24.5	 Like wild donkeys in the desert,
JOB.24.5	poor people go out to do their work, looking for food.
JOB.24.5	The plains provide food for their children.
JOB.24.6	 They harvest animal food in the field ⌊to feed themselves⌋.
JOB.24.6	They pick the leftover grapes in the wicked person’s vineyard.
JOB.24.7	 All night they lie naked
JOB.24.7	without a covering from the cold.
JOB.24.8	 They are drenched by the rainstorms in the mountains.
JOB.24.8	They hug the rocks because they can’t find shelter.
JOB.24.9	 “⌊People⌋ snatch the ⌊nursing⌋ orphan from a breast
JOB.24.9	and take a poor woman’s baby as security for a loan.
JOB.24.10	 ⌊That is why⌋ the poor go around naked.
JOB.24.10	They are hungry, yet they carry bundles of grain.
JOB.24.11	 They press out olive oil between rows ⌊of olive trees⌋.
JOB.24.11	They stomp on grapes in wine vats, yet they are thirsty.
JOB.24.12	 Those dying in the city groan.
JOB.24.12	Wounded people cry for help,
JOB.24.12	but God pays no attention to their prayers.
JOB.24.13	 “Such people are among those who rebel against the light.
JOB.24.13	They are not acquainted with its ways.
JOB.24.13	They do not stay on its paths.
JOB.24.14	 At dawn murderers rise; they kill the poor and needy.
JOB.24.14	At night they become thieves.
JOB.24.15	 Adulterers watch for twilight.
JOB.24.15	They say, ‘No one is watching us,’ as they cover their faces.
JOB.24.16	 In the dark, they break into houses,
JOB.24.16	⌊but⌋ by day they lock themselves in.
JOB.24.16	They do not ⌊even⌋ know the light,
JOB.24.17	 because morning and deep darkness are the same to them,
JOB.24.17	because they are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness.
JOB.24.18	 Such people are like scum on the surface of the water.
JOB.24.18	Their property is cursed in the land.
JOB.24.18	People do not travel the road that goes to their vineyards.
JOB.24.19	 ⌊Just as⌋ drought and heat steal water from snow,
JOB.24.19	so the grave steals people who sin.
JOB.24.20	 The womb forgets them.
JOB.24.20	Worms feast on them.
JOB.24.20	No one remembers them anymore,
JOB.24.20	and wickedness is snapped like a twig.
JOB.24.21	 These men take advantage of childless women.
JOB.24.21	These men show no kindness to widows.
JOB.24.22	 ⌊God⌋ will drag away ⌊these⌋ mighty men by his power.
JOB.24.22	These people may prosper,
JOB.24.22	but they will never feel secure about life.
JOB.24.23	 ⌊God⌋ may let them feel confident and self-reliant,

JOB.24.24	 ⌊Such people⌋ may be prosperous for a little while,
JOB.24.24	but then they’re gone.
JOB.24.24	They are brought down low and disappear like everything else.
JOB.24.24	They wither like heads of grain.
JOB.24.25	 “If it isn’t so, who can prove I’m a liar
JOB.24.25	and show that my words are worthless?”
JOB.25.1	 Then Bildad from Shuah replied ⌊to Job⌋,
JOB.25.2	 “Authority and terror belong to God.
JOB.25.2	He establishes peace in his high places.
JOB.25.3	 Is there any ⌊limit to the⌋ number of his troops?

JOB.26.1	 Then Job replied ⌊to his friends⌋,
JOB.26.2	 “You have helped the person who has no power

JOB.26.5	 “The souls of the dead tremble beneath the water,
JOB.26.5	and so do the creatures living there.
JOB.26.6	 Sheol is naked in God’s presence,
JOB.26.6	and Abaddon has no clothing.
JOB.26.7	 “He stretches out his heavens
JOB.26.7	He hangs the earth on nothing whatsoever.
JOB.26.8	 He holds the water in his thick clouds,
JOB.26.8	and the clouds don’t ⌊even⌋ split under its ⌊weight⌋.
JOB.26.9	 He covers his throne
JOB.26.9	by spreading his cloud over it.
JOB.26.10	 He marks the horizon on the surface of the water
JOB.26.10	at the boundary where light meets dark.
JOB.26.11	 The pillars of heaven tremble
JOB.26.11	and are astonished when he yells at them.
JOB.26.12	 With his power he calmed the sea.
JOB.26.12	With his insight he killed Rahab ⌊the sea monster⌋.
JOB.26.13	 With his wind the sky was cleared.
JOB.26.13	With his hand he stabbed the fleeing snake.
JOB.26.14	 “These are only glimpses of what he does.
JOB.26.14	We ⌊only⌋ hear a whisper of him!
JOB.26.14	Who can understand the thunder of his power?”
JOB.27.1	 Job continued his poems and said,
JOB.27.2	 “I swear an oath
JOB.27.2	by God, the one who has taken away my rights,
JOB.27.2	by the Almighty, who has made my life bitter:
JOB.27.3	 ‘As long as there is one breath ⌊left⌋ in me
JOB.27.3	and God’s breath fills my nostrils,
JOB.27.4	 my lips will not say anything wrong,
JOB.27.4	and my tongue will not mumble anything deceitful.’
JOB.27.5	 It’s unthinkable for me to admit that you are right.
JOB.27.5	Until I breathe my last breath, I will never give up my claim of integrity.
JOB.27.6	 I cling to my righteousness and won’t let go.
JOB.27.6	My conscience won’t accuse me as long as I live.
JOB.27.7	 “Let my enemy be ⌊treated⌋ like wicked people.
JOB.27.7	Let anyone who attacks me be ⌊treated⌋ like unrighteous people.
JOB.27.8	 After all, what hope does the godless person have when he is cut off,
JOB.27.8	when God takes away his life?
JOB.27.9	 Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him?
JOB.27.10	 Can he be happy with the Almighty?
JOB.27.10	Can he call on God at all times?
JOB.27.11	 “I will teach you about God’s power.
JOB.27.11	I will not hide what the Almighty has done.
JOB.27.12	 Certainly, you have all seen it.
JOB.27.12	Why then do you chatter on about such nonsense?
JOB.27.13	 This is what God has waiting for the wicked person,
JOB.27.13	the inheritance that tyrants receive from the Almighty:
JOB.27.14	 If he has many children, swords will kill them,
JOB.27.14	and his descendants won’t have enough food.
JOB.27.15	 Those who survive him will be buried by a plague,
JOB.27.15	and their widows won’t cry ⌊for them⌋.
JOB.27.16	 Though he collects silver like dust
JOB.27.16	and piles up clothing like dirt,
JOB.27.17	 righteous people will wear what he piles up,
JOB.27.17	and the innocent will divide the silver
JOB.27.17	⌊among themselves⌋.
JOB.27.18	 He builds his house like a moth,
JOB.27.18	like a shack that a watchman makes.
JOB.27.19	 He may go to bed rich, but he’ll never be rich again.
JOB.27.19	When he opens his eyes, nothing will be left.
JOB.27.20	 Terrors overtake him like a flood.
JOB.27.20	A windstorm snatches him away at night.
JOB.27.21	 The east wind carries him away, and he’s gone.
JOB.27.21	It sweeps him from his place.
JOB.27.22	 It hurls itself at him without mercy.
JOB.27.22	He flees from its power.
JOB.27.23	 It claps its hands over him.
JOB.27.23	It whistles at him from his own place.
JOB.28.1	 “There is a place where silver is mined
JOB.28.1	and a place where gold is refined.
JOB.28.2	 Iron is taken from the ground,
JOB.28.2	and rocks are melted for ⌊their⌋ copper.
JOB.28.3	 ⌊Humans⌋ bring an end to darkness ⌊there⌋
JOB.28.3	and search to the limit of the gloomy, pitch-black rock.
JOB.28.4	 They open up a mineshaft far from civilization,
JOB.28.4	where no one has set foot.
JOB.28.4	⌊In this shaft⌋ men dangle and swing back and forth.
JOB.28.5	 “Above the ground food grows,
JOB.28.5	but beneath it the food decays as if ⌊it were burned⌋ by fire.
JOB.28.6	 That place’s stones are sapphire.
JOB.28.6	Its dust contains gold.
JOB.28.7	 No bird of prey knows the way to it.
JOB.28.7	No hawk’s eye has ever seen it.
JOB.28.8	 No proud beast has ever walked on it.
JOB.28.8	No ferocious lion has ever passed over it.
JOB.28.9	 “Humans exert their power on the flinty rocks
JOB.28.9	and overturn mountains at their base.
JOB.28.10	 They cut out mineshafts in the rocks.
JOB.28.10	Their eyes see every precious thing.
JOB.28.11	 They explore
JOB.28.11	so that they bring hidden treasures to light.
JOB.28.12	 “Where can wisdom be found?
JOB.28.12	Where does understanding live?
JOB.28.13	 No mortal knows where it is.
JOB.28.13	It cannot be found in this world of the living.
JOB.28.14	 The deep ocean says, ‘It isn’t in me.’
JOB.28.14	The sea says, ‘It isn’t with me.’
JOB.28.15	 You cannot obtain it with solid gold
JOB.28.15	or buy it for any amount of silver.
JOB.28.16	 It can’t be bought with the gold from Ophir
JOB.28.16	or with precious onyx or sapphire.
JOB.28.17	 Neither gold nor glass can equal its value.
JOB.28.17	Nor can gold ornaments, jewels, or crystal
JOB.28.18	 be exchanged for it.
JOB.28.18	Wisdom is more valuable than gems.
JOB.28.19	 Topaz from Ethiopia cannot equal its value.
JOB.28.19	It cannot be bought for ⌊any amount of⌋ pure gold.
JOB.28.20	 “Where does wisdom come from?
JOB.28.20	Where does understanding live?
JOB.28.21	 It is hidden from the eyes of every living being,
JOB.28.21	hidden even from the birds in the air.
JOB.28.22	 Decay and Death say,
JOB.28.22	‘We’ve heard a rumor about it.’
JOB.28.23	 “God understands the way to it.
JOB.28.23	He knows where it lives
JOB.28.24	 because he can see to the ends of the earth
JOB.28.24	and observe everything under heaven.
JOB.28.25	 When he gave the wind its force
JOB.28.25	and measured the water ⌊in the sea⌋,
JOB.28.26	 when he made rules for the rain
JOB.28.26	and set paths for the thunderstorms,
JOB.28.27	 then he saw it and announced it.
JOB.28.27	He confirmed it and examined it.
JOB.28.28	 So he told humans,
JOB.28.28	‘The fear of the Lord is wisdom!
JOB.28.28	To stay away from evil is understanding.’ ”
JOB.29.1	 Job continued his poems and said,
JOB.29.2	 “If only my life could be like it used to be,
JOB.29.2	in the days when God watched over me,
JOB.29.3	 when he made his lamp shine on my head,
JOB.29.3	when I walked through the dark in his light.
JOB.29.4	 If only I were in the prime of my life ⌊again⌋,
JOB.29.4	when God was an adviser in my tent.
JOB.29.5	 When the Almighty was still with me
JOB.29.5	and my children were around me,
JOB.29.6	 my steps were bathed in buttermilk,
JOB.29.6	and the rocks poured streams of olive oil on me.
JOB.29.7	 When I went through the city gate
JOB.29.7	and took my seat in the town square,
JOB.29.8	 young men saw me and kept out of sight.
JOB.29.8	Old men stood up straight out of respect ⌊for me⌋.
JOB.29.9	 Princes held back ⌊their⌋ words
JOB.29.9	and put their hands over their mouths.
JOB.29.10	 The voices of nobles were hushed,
JOB.29.10	and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.
JOB.29.11	 “⌊Any⌋ ears that heard me blessed me.
JOB.29.11	⌊Any⌋ eyes that saw me spoke well of me,
JOB.29.12	 because I rescued the poor who called ⌊for help⌋
JOB.29.12	and the orphans who had no one to help them.
JOB.29.13	 I received a blessing from the dying.
JOB.29.13	I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	 I put on righteousness, and it was my clothing.
JOB.29.14	I practiced justice, and it was my robe and my turban.
JOB.29.15	 I was eyes for the blind person.
JOB.29.15	I was feet for the lame person.
JOB.29.16	 I was father to the needy.
JOB.29.16	I carefully investigated cases brought by strangers.
JOB.29.17	 I broke the teeth of the wicked person
JOB.29.17	and made him drop the prey out of his mouth.
JOB.29.18	 “I thought, ‘I may die in my own house,
JOB.29.18	but I will make my days as numerous as the sand.
JOB.29.19	 My roots will grow toward the water,
JOB.29.19	and dew will lie on my branches all night.
JOB.29.20	 My power will be fresh ⌊every day⌋,
JOB.29.20	and the bow in my hand will remain new.’
JOB.29.21	 “People listened to me eagerly,
JOB.29.21	quietly waiting for my advice.
JOB.29.22	 After I had spoken, they wouldn’t speak again.
JOB.29.22	After all, my words fell gently on them.
JOB.29.23	 They were as eager to hear me as they were for rain.
JOB.29.23	They opened their mouths wide as if waiting for a spring shower.
JOB.29.24	 When I smiled at them, they could hardly believe it,
JOB.29.24	but the expression on my face did not change.
JOB.29.25	 I decided how they should live.
JOB.29.25	I sat as their leader.
JOB.29.25	I lived like a king among his troops,
JOB.29.25	like one who comforts mourners.
JOB.30.1	 “But now those who are younger than I am laugh at me.
JOB.30.1	I didn’t think their fathers were fit to sit with the dogs of my flock.
JOB.30.2	 Of what use to me was the strength of their hands?
JOB.30.2	Their strength is gone.
JOB.30.3	 Shriveled up from need and hunger,
JOB.30.3	they gnaw at the dry and barren ground during the night.
JOB.30.4	 They pick saltwort from the underbrush,
JOB.30.4	and the roots of the broom plant are their food.
JOB.30.5	 They are driven from the community.
JOB.30.5	People shout at them in the same way they shout at thieves.
JOB.30.6	 They have to live in dry riverbeds,
JOB.30.6	in holes in the ground, and among rocks.
JOB.30.7	 They howl in bushes
JOB.30.7	and huddle together under thornbushes.
JOB.30.8	 Godless fools and worthless people
JOB.30.8	are forced out of the land with whips.
JOB.30.9	 “And now they make fun of me with songs.
JOB.30.9	I have become a joke to them.
JOB.30.10	 Since they consider me disgusting, they keep their distance from me
JOB.30.10	and don’t hesitate to spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	 Because God has untied my cord and has made me suffer,
JOB.30.11	they are no longer restrained in my presence.
JOB.30.12	 They have attacked me on my right side like a mob.
JOB.30.12	They trip my feet
JOB.30.12	and then prepare ways to destroy me.
JOB.30.13	 Yes, they remove all traces of my path in order to destroy me.
JOB.30.13	No one is there to help me against them.
JOB.30.14	 They come through a wide hole ⌊in the wall⌋.
JOB.30.14	They crawl through the ruins.
JOB.30.15	 Terrors are directed toward me.
JOB.30.15	They blow away my dignity like the wind.
JOB.30.15	My prosperity vanishes like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	 “Now my life is pouring out of me.
JOB.30.16	Days of suffering seize me.
JOB.30.17	 At night God pierces my bones.
JOB.30.17	My body 
JOB.30.18	 With great strength he grabs my clothes.
JOB.30.18	He seizes me by the collar of my robe.
JOB.30.19	 He throws me into the dirt
JOB.30.19	so that I become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	 “I call to you for help,
JOB.30.20	but you don’t answer me.
JOB.30.20	I stand up, but you just look at me.
JOB.30.21	 You have begun to treat me cruelly.
JOB.30.21	With your mighty hand you assault me.
JOB.30.22	 You pick me up and let the wind carry me away.
JOB.30.22	You toss me around with a storm.
JOB.30.23	 I know you will lead me to death,
JOB.30.23	to the dwelling place appointed for all living beings.
JOB.30.24	 “But God doesn’t stretch out his hand against one who is ruined
JOB.30.24	when that person calls for help in his disaster.
JOB.30.25	 Didn’t I cry for the person whose days were difficult?
JOB.30.25	Didn’t my soul grieve for the poor?
JOB.30.26	 When I waited for good, evil came.
JOB.30.26	When I looked for light, darkness came.
JOB.30.27	 My insides are churning and won’t calm down.
JOB.30.27	Days of misery are ahead of me.
JOB.30.28	 I walk in the dark without the sun.
JOB.30.28	I stand up in public and call for help.
JOB.30.29	 I’m a brother to jackals
JOB.30.29	and a companion of ostriches.
JOB.30.30	 My skin turns dark and peels.
JOB.30.30	My body burns with fever.
JOB.30.31	 So my lyre is used for mourning
JOB.30.31	and my flute for loud weeping.
JOB.31.1	 “I have made an agreement with my eyes.
JOB.31.1	Then how can I look with lust at a virgin?
JOB.31.2	 What would God above do ⌊to me⌋?
JOB.31.2	What would be my inheritance from the Almighty on high?
JOB.31.3	 Aren’t there catastrophes for wicked people
JOB.31.3	and disasters for those who do wrong?
JOB.31.4	 Doesn’t he see my ways
JOB.31.4	and count all my steps?
JOB.31.5	 “If I have walked with lies
JOB.31.5	or my feet have run after deception,
JOB.31.6	 ⌊then⌋ let God weigh me on honest scales,
JOB.31.6	and he will know I have integrity.
JOB.31.7	 “If my steps have left the ⌊proper⌋ path,
JOB.31.7	or my heart has followed ⌊the desire of⌋ my eyes,
JOB.31.7	or my hands are stained ⌊with sin⌋,
JOB.31.8	 ⌊then⌋ let someone else eat what I have planted,
JOB.31.8	and let my crops be uprooted.
JOB.31.9	 “If I have been seduced by a woman
JOB.31.9	or I have secretly waited near my neighbor’s door,
JOB.31.10	 ⌊then⌋ let my wife grind for another ⌊man⌋,
JOB.31.10	and let other ⌊men⌋ kneel over her.
JOB.31.11	 That would be a scandal,
JOB.31.11	and that would be a criminal offense.
JOB.31.12	 It would be a fire that burns even in Abaddon.
JOB.31.12	It would uproot my entire harvest.
JOB.31.13	 “If I have abused the rights of my servants, male or female,
JOB.31.13	when they have disagreed with me,
JOB.31.14	 then what could I do if God rises up?
JOB.31.14	If he examines me, how could I answer him?
JOB.31.15	 Didn’t he who made me in my mother’s belly make them?
JOB.31.15	Didn’t the same God form us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	 “If I have refused the requests of the poor
JOB.31.16	or made a widow’s eyes stop ⌊looking for help⌋,
JOB.31.17	 or have eaten my food alone
JOB.31.17	without letting the orphan eat any of it. . . .
JOB.31.18	 (From my youth the orphan grew up with me
JOB.31.18	as though I were his father,
JOB.31.18	and from my birth I treated the widow kindly.)
JOB.31.19	 If I have seen anyone die because he had no clothes
JOB.31.19	or a poor person going naked. . . .
JOB.31.20	 (If his body didn’t bless me,
JOB.31.20	or the wool from my sheep didn’t keep him warm. . . .)
JOB.31.21	 If I have shaken my fist at an orphan
JOB.31.21	because I knew that others would back me up in court,
JOB.31.22	 ⌊then⌋ let my shoulder fall out of its socket,
JOB.31.22	and let my arm be broken at the elbow.
JOB.31.23	 “A disaster from God terrifies me.
JOB.31.23	In the presence of his majesty I can do nothing.
JOB.31.24	 “If I put my confidence in gold
JOB.31.24	or said to fine gold, ‘I trust you’. . . .
JOB.31.25	 If I enjoyed being very rich
JOB.31.25	because my hand had found great ⌊wealth⌋. . . .
JOB.31.26	 If I saw the light shine
JOB.31.26	or the moon move along in its splendor
JOB.31.27	 so that my heart was secretly tempted,
JOB.31.27	and I threw them a kiss with my hand,
JOB.31.28	 then that, too, would be a criminal offense,
JOB.31.28	and I would have denied God above.
JOB.31.29	 “If I enjoyed the ruin of my enemy
JOB.31.29	or celebrated when harm came to him
JOB.31.30	 (even though I didn’t speak sinfully
JOB.31.30	by calling down a curse on his life). . . .
JOB.31.31	 “If the people who were in my tent had said,
JOB.31.31	‘We wish we had never filled ⌊our stomachs⌋ with his food’. . . .
JOB.31.32	 (The visitor never spent the night outside,
JOB.31.32	because I opened my door to the traveler.)
JOB.31.33	 “If I have covered my disobedience like Adam
JOB.31.33	and kept my sin to myself,
JOB.31.34	 because I dreaded the large, noisy crowd
JOB.31.34	and because the contempt of the ⌊local⌋ mobs terrified me
JOB.31.34	so that I kept quiet and didn’t go outside. . . .
JOB.31.35	 “If only I had someone who would listen to me!
JOB.31.35	Look, here is my signature!
JOB.31.35	Let the Almighty answer me.
JOB.31.35	Let the prosecutor write ⌊his complaint⌋ on a scroll.
JOB.31.36	 I would certainly carry it on my shoulder
JOB.31.36	and place it on my head like a crown.
JOB.31.37	 I would tell him the number of my steps
JOB.31.37	and approach him like a prince.
JOB.31.38	 “If my land has cried out against me,
JOB.31.38	and its furrows have wept. . . .
JOB.31.39	 If I have eaten its produce without paying for it
JOB.31.39	and made its owners breathe their last,
JOB.31.40	 ⌊then⌋ let it grow thistles instead of wheat,
JOB.31.40	and foul-smelling weeds instead of barley.”
JOB.31.40	This is the end of Job’s words.
JOB.32.1	 These three men stopped answering Job because Job thought he was righteous. 
JOB.32.2	 Then Elihu, son of Barachel, a descendant of Buz from the family of Ram, became very angry with Job because Job thought he was more righteous than God. 
JOB.32.3	 Elihu was also very angry with Job’s three friends because they had found no answer. They made it look as if God
JOB.32.4	 Elihu waited as they spoke to Job because they were older than he was. 
JOB.32.5	 When Elihu saw that the three men had no further responses, he became very angry.
JOB.32.6	 So Elihu, son of Barachel, the descendant of Buz, replied ⌊to Job⌋,
JOB.32.6	“I am young, and you are old.
JOB.32.6	That’s why I refrained from speaking
JOB.32.6	and was afraid to tell you what I know.
JOB.32.7	 I thought, ‘Age should speak,
JOB.32.7	and experience should teach wisdom.’
JOB.32.8	 However, there is in humans a Spirit,
JOB.32.8	the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.
JOB.32.9	 People do not become wise merely because they live long.
JOB.32.9	They don’t understand what justice is merely because they’re old.
JOB.32.10	 “That is why I say, ‘Listen to me!
JOB.32.10	Let me tell you what I know.’
JOB.32.11	 I waited for you to speak.
JOB.32.11	I listened for you to share your understanding
JOB.32.11	until you could find the right words.
JOB.32.12	 I’ve paid close attention to you,
JOB.32.12	but none of you refuted Job.
JOB.32.12	None of you has an answer to what he says.
JOB.32.13	 So don’t say, ‘We’ve found wisdom.
JOB.32.13	Let God, not humans, defeat him.’
JOB.32.14	 Job did not choose his words to refute me,
JOB.32.14	so I won’t answer him with your speeches.
JOB.32.15	 “Job’s friends have been overwhelmed and don’t have any more answers.
JOB.32.15	They don’t have another word to say.
JOB.32.16	 Should I wait because they don’t speak,
JOB.32.16	because they stand there and don’t have any more answers?
JOB.32.17	 “I’ll give my answer.
JOB.32.17	I’ll tell you what I know.
JOB.32.18	 I’m full of words.
JOB.32.18	The Spirit within me forces me ⌊to speak⌋.
JOB.32.19	 My belly is like ⌊a bottle of⌋ wine that has not been opened,
JOB.32.19	like new wineskins that are ready to burst.
JOB.32.20	 I must speak to get relief.
JOB.32.20	I must open my mouth and answer.
JOB.32.21	 I won’t be partial toward anyone
JOB.32.21	or flatter anyone.
JOB.32.22	 I don’t know how to flatter.
JOB.32.22	If I did, my maker would soon carry me away.
JOB.33.1	 “Please, Job, listen to my words
JOB.33.1	and consider everything I say.
JOB.33.2	 I’ve opened my mouth.
JOB.33.2	The words are on the tip of my tongue.
JOB.33.3	 My words are straight from the heart,
JOB.33.3	and I sincerely speak the knowledge that is on my lips.
JOB.33.4	 “God’s Spirit has made me.
JOB.33.4	The breath of the Almighty gives me life.
JOB.33.5	 Answer me if you can.
JOB.33.5	Present your case to me, and take your stand.
JOB.33.6	 Indeed, I stand in front of God as you do.
JOB.33.6	I, too, was formed from a piece of clay.
JOB.33.7	 You certainly don’t need to be terrified of me.
JOB.33.7	I won’t put too much pressure on you.
JOB.33.8	 “But you spoke directly to me,
JOB.33.8	and I listened to your words.
JOB.33.9	 ⌊You said,⌋ ‘I’m pure—without any rebellious acts ⌊against God⌋.
JOB.33.9	I’m clean; I have no sin.
JOB.33.10	 God is only looking for an excuse to attack me.
JOB.33.10	He considers me his enemy.
JOB.33.11	 He puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths.’
JOB.33.12	 You aren’t right about this!
JOB.33.12	I’ve got an answer for you:
JOB.33.12	God is greater than any mortal.
JOB.33.13	 Why do you quarrel with him
JOB.33.13	since he doesn’t answer any questions?
JOB.33.14	 “God speaks in one way,
JOB.33.14	even in two ways without people noticing it:
JOB.33.15	 In a dream, a prophetic vision at night,
JOB.33.15	when people fall into a deep sleep,
JOB.33.15	when they sleep on their beds,
JOB.33.16	 he opens people’s ears
JOB.33.16	and terrifies them with warnings.
JOB.33.17	 ⌊He warns them⌋ to turn away from doing ⌊wrong⌋
JOB.33.17	and to stop being arrogant.
JOB.33.18	 He keeps their souls from the pit
JOB.33.18	and their lives from crossing the River ⌊of Death⌋.
JOB.33.19	 In pain on their sickbeds, they are disciplined
JOB.33.19	with endless aching in their bones
JOB.33.20	 so that their whole being hates food
JOB.33.20	and they lose their appetite for a delicious meal.
JOB.33.21	 Their flesh becomes so thin that it can’t be seen.
JOB.33.21	Their bones, not seen before, will be exposed.
JOB.33.22	 Their souls approach the pit.
JOB.33.22	Their lives come close to those already dead.
JOB.33.23	 “If they have a messenger for them,
JOB.33.23	a spokesman, one in a thousand,
JOB.33.23	to tell people what is right for them,
JOB.33.24	 then he will have pity on them and say,
JOB.33.24	‘Free them from going into the pit.
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom.’
JOB.33.25	 Then their flesh will become softer than a child’s.
JOB.33.25	They will go back to the days of their youth.
JOB.33.26	 They will pray to God, who will be pleased with them.
JOB.33.26	They will see God’s face and shout for joy
JOB.33.26	as he restores their righteousness.
JOB.33.27	 Each one sings in front of other people and says,
JOB.33.27	‘I sinned and did wrong instead of what was right,
JOB.33.27	and it did me no good.
JOB.33.28	 The messenger has freed my soul from going into the pit,
JOB.33.28	and my life will see the light.’
JOB.33.29	 Truly, God does all this two or three times with people
JOB.33.30	 to turn their souls away from the pit
JOB.33.30	and to enlighten them with the light of life.
JOB.33.31	 “Pay attention, Job! Listen to me!
JOB.33.31	Keep quiet, and let me speak.
JOB.33.32	 If you have a response, answer me.
JOB.33.32	Speak, because I’d be happy if you were right.
JOB.33.33	 If not, you listen to me.
JOB.33.33	Keep quiet, and I’ll teach you wisdom.”
JOB.34.1	 Elihu continued to speak ⌊to Job and his friends⌋,
JOB.34.2	 “Listen to my words, you wise men.
JOB.34.2	Open your ears to me, you intelligent men.
JOB.34.3	 The ear tests words
JOB.34.3	like the tongue tastes food.
JOB.34.4	 Let’s decide for ourselves what is right
JOB.34.4	and agree among ourselves as to what is good,
JOB.34.5	 because Job has said,
JOB.34.5	‘I’m righteous, but God has taken away my rights.
JOB.34.6	 I’m considered a liar in spite of my rights.
JOB.34.6	I’ve been wounded by a deadly arrow,
JOB.34.6	though I haven’t been disobedient.’
JOB.34.7	 What person is like Job,
JOB.34.7	who drinks scorn like water,
JOB.34.8	 who travels with troublemakers
JOB.34.8	and associates with evil people?
JOB.34.9	 He says, ‘It doesn’t do any good to try to please God.’
JOB.34.10	 “You people who have understanding, listen to me.
JOB.34.10	It is unthinkable that God would ever do evil
JOB.34.10	or that the Almighty would ever do wicked things.
JOB.34.11	 God will repay humanity for what it has done
JOB.34.11	and will give each person what he deserves.
JOB.34.12	 Certainly, God will never do anything evil,
JOB.34.12	and the Almighty will never pervert justice.
JOB.34.13	 Who put him in charge of the earth?
JOB.34.13	Who appointed him to be over the whole world?
JOB.34.14	 If he thought only of himself
JOB.34.14	and withdrew his Spirit and his breath,
JOB.34.15	 all living beings would die together,
JOB.34.15	and humanity would return to dust.
JOB.34.16	 “If you understand, listen to this.
JOB.34.16	Open your ears to my words!
JOB.34.17	 Should anyone who hates justice be allowed to govern?
JOB.34.17	Will you condemn the one who is righteous and mighty?
JOB.34.18	 Should anyone ⌊even⌋ say to a king,
JOB.34.18	‘You good-for-nothing scoundrel!’
JOB.34.18	or to nobles, ‘You wicked people!’
JOB.34.19	 The one who is righteous and mighty
JOB.34.19	does not grant special favors to princes
JOB.34.19	or prefer important people over poor people
JOB.34.19	because his hands made them all.
JOB.34.20	 They die suddenly in the middle of the night.
JOB.34.20	People have seizures and pass away.
JOB.34.20	Mighty people are taken away but not by human hands.
JOB.34.21	 God’s eyes are on a person’s ways.
JOB.34.21	He sees all his steps.
JOB.34.22	 There’s no darkness or deep shadow
JOB.34.22	where troublemakers can hide.
JOB.34.23	 He doesn’t have to set a time for a person
JOB.34.23	in order to bring him to divine judgment.
JOB.34.24	 He breaks mighty people into pieces without examining them
JOB.34.24	and puts others in their places.
JOB.34.25	 He knows what they do,
JOB.34.25	so he overthrows them at night, and they’re crushed.
JOB.34.26	 In return for their evil, he strikes them in public,
JOB.34.27	 because they turned away from following him
JOB.34.27	and didn’t consider any of his ways.
JOB.34.28	 They forced the poor to cry out to him,
JOB.34.28	and he hears the cry of those who suffer.
JOB.34.29	 If he keeps quiet, who can condemn him?
JOB.34.29	If he hides his face, who can see him
JOB.34.29	whether it is a nation or a single person?
JOB.34.30	 ⌊He does this⌋ so that godless people cannot rule
JOB.34.30	and so that they cannot trap people.
JOB.34.31	 “But suppose such a person says to God, ‘I am guilty,
JOB.34.31	I will stop my immoral behavior.
JOB.34.32	 Teach me what I cannot see.
JOB.34.32	If I’ve done wrong, I won’t do it again.’
JOB.34.33	 Should God reward you on your own terms since you have rejected his?
JOB.34.33	You must choose, not I.
JOB.34.33	Tell me what you know. Speak!
JOB.34.34	 “People of understanding, the wise people
JOB.34.34	who listen to me, will say,
JOB.34.35	 ‘Job speaks without knowledge.
JOB.34.35	His words show no insight.’
JOB.34.36	 “My Father, let Job be thoroughly tested
JOB.34.36	for giving answers like wicked people do.
JOB.34.37	 He adds disobedience to his sin.
JOB.34.37	He claps his hands to insult us.
JOB.34.37	He multiplies his words against God.”
JOB.35.1	 Elihu continued to speak ⌊to Job and his friends⌋,
JOB.35.2	 “Do you think this is right
JOB.35.2	when you say, ‘My case is more just than God’s,’
JOB.35.3	 when you ask, ‘What benefit is it to you?’
JOB.35.3	and, ‘What would I gain by sinning?’
JOB.35.4	 I will answer you and your friends.
JOB.35.5	 “Look at the heavens and see.
JOB.35.5	Observe the clouds high above you.
JOB.35.6	 If you’ve sinned, what effect can you have on God?
JOB.35.6	If you’ve done many wrongs, what can you do to him?
JOB.35.7	 If you’re righteous, what can you give him,
JOB.35.7	or what can he get from you?
JOB.35.8	 Your wickedness affects only someone like yourself.
JOB.35.8	Your righteousness affects only the descendants of Adam.
JOB.35.9	 The weight of oppression makes them cry out.
JOB.35.9	The power of mighty people makes them call for help.
JOB.35.10	 But no one asks,
JOB.35.10	‘Where is God, my Creator,
JOB.35.10	who inspires songs in the night,
JOB.35.11	 who teaches us more than he teaches the animals of the earth,
JOB.35.11	who makes us wiser than the birds in the sky?’
JOB.35.12	 Then they cry out, but he doesn’t answer them
JOB.35.12	because of the arrogance of ⌊those⌋ evil people.
JOB.35.13	 “Surely, God doesn’t listen to idle complaints.
JOB.35.13	The Almighty doesn’t even pay attention to them.
JOB.35.14	 Although you say that you pay attention to him,
JOB.35.14	your case is in front of him, but you’ll have to wait for him.
JOB.35.15	 And now ⌊you say⌋ that his anger doesn’t punish ⌊anyone⌋
JOB.35.15	and he isn’t too concerned about evil.
JOB.35.16	 Job opens his mouth for no good reason
JOB.35.16	and talks a lot without having any knowledge.”
JOB.36.1	 Elihu continued to speak ⌊to Job⌋,
JOB.36.2	 “Be patient with me a little longer, and I will show you
JOB.36.2	that there is more to be said in God’s defense.
JOB.36.3	 I will get my knowledge from far away
JOB.36.3	and prove that my Creator is fair.
JOB.36.4	 Certainly, my words are not lies.
JOB.36.4	The one who knows everything is ⌊speaking⌋ with you.
JOB.36.5	 “Certainly, God is mighty.
JOB.36.5	He doesn’t despise anyone.
JOB.36.5	He is mighty and brave.
JOB.36.6	 He doesn’t allow the wicked person to live.
JOB.36.6	He grants justice to those who are oppressed.
JOB.36.7	 He doesn’t take his eyes off righteous people.
JOB.36.7	He seats them on thrones with kings to honor them forever.
JOB.36.8	 However, if righteous people are bound in chains
JOB.36.8	and tangled in ropes of misery,
JOB.36.9	 he tells them what they’ve done wrong
JOB.36.9	and that they’ve behaved arrogantly.
JOB.36.10	 He makes them listen to his warning
JOB.36.10	and orders them to turn away from wrong.
JOB.36.11	 “If righteous people listen and serve ⌊him⌋,
JOB.36.11	they will live out their days in prosperity
JOB.36.11	and their years in comfort.
JOB.36.12	 But if they don’t listen,
JOB.36.12	they will cross the River ⌊of Death⌋
JOB.36.12	and die like those who have no knowledge.
JOB.36.13	 But those who have godless hearts remain angry.
JOB.36.13	They don’t even call for help when he chains them up.
JOB.36.14	 They die while they’re young,
JOB.36.14	or they live on as male prostitutes in the temples of idols.
JOB.36.15	 He rescues suffering people through their suffering,
JOB.36.15	and he opens their ears through distress.
JOB.36.16	 “Yes, he lured you away from the jaws of trouble
JOB.36.16	into an open area where you were not restrained,
JOB.36.16	and your table was covered with rich foods.
JOB.36.17	 But you are given the judgment evil people deserve.
JOB.36.17	A fair judgment will be upheld.
JOB.36.18	 Be careful that you are not led astray with riches.
JOB.36.18	Don’t let a large bribe turn you ⌊to evil ways⌋.
JOB.36.19	 Will your riches save you from having to suffer?
JOB.36.19	Will all your mighty strength help you?
JOB.36.20	 Don’t look forward to the night,
JOB.36.20	when people disappear from their places.
JOB.36.21	 Be careful! Don’t turn to evil,
JOB.36.21	because you have chosen evil instead of suffering.
JOB.36.22	 “God does great things by his power.
JOB.36.22	Is there any teacher like him?
JOB.36.23	 Who can tell him which way he should go?
JOB.36.23	Who can say to him, ‘You did wrong’?
JOB.36.24	 Remember that you should praise his work.
JOB.36.24	People have sung about it.
JOB.36.25	 Every person has seen it.
JOB.36.25	Mortals have looked at it from a distance.
JOB.36.26	 “Certainly, God is so great
JOB.36.26	that he is beyond our understanding.
JOB.36.26	The number of his years cannot be counted.
JOB.36.27	 He collects drops of water.
JOB.36.27	He distills rain from his mist,
JOB.36.28	 which then drips from the clouds.
JOB.36.28	It pours down on many people.
JOB.36.29	 Can anyone really understand how clouds spread out
JOB.36.29	or how he thunders from his dwelling place?
JOB.36.30	 Look, he scatters his flashes of lightning around him
JOB.36.30	and covers the depths of the sea.
JOB.36.31	 This is how he uses the rains to provide for people
JOB.36.31	and to give them more than enough food.
JOB.36.32	 He fills his hands with lightning
JOB.36.32	and orders it to hit the target.
JOB.36.33	 The thunder announces his coming.
JOB.36.33	The storm announces his angry wrath.
JOB.37.1	 “My heart pounds because of this
JOB.37.1	and jumps out of its place.
JOB.37.2	 Listen! Listen to the roar of God’s voice,
JOB.37.2	to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
JOB.37.3	 He flashes his lightning everywhere under heaven.
JOB.37.3	His light flashes to the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	 It is followed by the roar of his voice.
JOB.37.4	He thunders with his majestic voice.
JOB.37.4	He doesn’t hold the lightning back when his thunder is heard.
JOB.37.5	 God’s voice thunders in miraculous ways.
JOB.37.5	It does great things that we cannot understand.
JOB.37.6	 “He says to the snow, ‘Fall to the ground,’
JOB.37.6	and to the pouring rain, ‘Rain harder!’
JOB.37.7	 He makes it impossible to do anything 
JOB.37.7	so that people will recognize his work.
JOB.37.8	 Animals go into their dens
JOB.37.8	and stay in their lairs.
JOB.37.9	 A storm comes out of its chamber.
JOB.37.9	It is cold because of the strong winds.
JOB.37.10	 God’s breath produces ice,
JOB.37.10	and the seas freeze over.
JOB.37.11	 Yes, he loads the thick clouds with moisture
JOB.37.11	and scatters his lightning from the clouds.
JOB.37.12	 He guides the clouds as they churn round and round
JOB.37.12	over the face of the inhabited earth
JOB.37.12	to do everything he orders them.
JOB.37.13	 Whether for discipline,
JOB.37.13	or for ⌊the good of⌋ his earth,
JOB.37.13	or out of mercy,
JOB.37.13	he makes the storm appear.
JOB.37.14	 “Open your ears to this, Job.
JOB.37.14	Stop and consider God’s miracles.

JOB.37.19	 Teach us what we should say to him.
JOB.37.19	We are unable to prepare ⌊a case⌋ because of darkness.
JOB.37.20	 Should he be told that I want to speak?

JOB.40.19	Its maker approaches it with his sword.
JOB.40.20	 The hills bring it food,
JOB.40.20	and all the wild animals play there.
JOB.40.21	 It lies down under the lotus plants
JOB.40.21	in a hiding place among reeds and swamps.
JOB.40.22	 Lotus plants provide it with cover.
JOB.40.22	Poplars by the stream surround it.
JOB.40.23	 Though the river flows powerfully against it, it’s not alarmed.
JOB.40.23	It’s confident ⌊even⌋ when the Jordan rushes against its mouth.
JOB.40.24	 Can anyone blind its eyes 
JOB.40.24	or pierce its nose with snares?
JOB.41.1	 “Can you pull Leviathan 
JOB.41.1	or tie its tongue down with a rope?
JOB.41.2	 Can you put a ring through its nose
JOB.41.2	or pierce its jaw with a hook?
JOB.41.3	 Will it plead with you for mercy
JOB.41.3	or speak tenderly to you?
JOB.41.4	 Will it make an agreement with you
JOB.41.4	so that you can take it as your permanent slave?
JOB.41.5	 Can you play with it like a bird
JOB.41.5	or keep it on a leash for your girls?
JOB.41.6	 Will traders bargain over it
JOB.41.6	and divide it among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	 Can you fill its hide with harpoons
JOB.41.7	or its head with fishing spears?
JOB.41.8	 Lay your hand on it.
JOB.41.8	Think of the struggle!
JOB.41.8	Don’t do it again!
JOB.41.9	 Certainly, any hope ⌊of defeating it⌋ is a false hope.
JOB.41.9	Doesn’t the sight of it overwhelm you?
JOB.41.10	 No one is brave enough to provoke Leviathan.
JOB.41.10	Then who can stand in front of me? 
JOB.41.11	 Who can confront me that I should repay him?
JOB.41.11	Everything under heaven belongs to me!
JOB.41.12	 “I will not be silent about Leviathan’s limbs,
JOB.41.12	its strength, or its graceful form.
JOB.41.13	 Who can skin its hide?
JOB.41.13	Who can approach it with a harness?
JOB.41.14	 Who can open its closed mouth?
JOB.41.14	Its teeth are surrounded by terror.
JOB.41.15	 Its back has rows of scales that are tightly sealed.
JOB.41.16	 One is so close to the other
JOB.41.16	that there is no space between them.
JOB.41.17	 Each is joined to the other.
JOB.41.17	They are locked together and inseparable.
JOB.41.18	 When Leviathan sneezes, it gives out a flash of light.
JOB.41.18	Its eyes are like the first rays of the dawn.
JOB.41.19	 Flames shoot from its mouth.
JOB.41.19	Sparks of fire fly from it.
JOB.41.20	 Smoke comes from its nostrils
JOB.41.20	like a boiling pot heated over brushwood.
JOB.41.21	 Its breath sets coals on fire,
JOB.41.21	and a flame pours from its mouth.
JOB.41.22	 Strength resides in its neck,
JOB.41.22	and power dances in front of it.
JOB.41.23	 The folds of its flesh stick to each other.
JOB.41.23	They are solid and cannot be moved.
JOB.41.24	 Its chest is solid like a rock,
JOB.41.24	solid like a millstone.
JOB.41.25	 “The mighty are afraid when Leviathan rises.
JOB.41.25	Broken down, they draw back.
JOB.41.26	 A sword may strike it but not pierce it.
JOB.41.26	Neither will a spear, lance, or dart.
JOB.41.27	 It considers iron to be like straw
JOB.41.27	and bronze to be like rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	 An arrow won’t make it run away.
JOB.41.28	Stones from a sling turn to dust against it.
JOB.41.29	 It considers clubs to be like stubble,
JOB.41.29	and it laughs at a rattling javelin.
JOB.41.30	 Its underside is like sharp pieces of broken pottery.
JOB.41.30	It stretches out like a threshing 
JOB.41.31	 It makes the deep sea boil like a pot.
JOB.41.31	It stirs up the ocean like a boiling kettle.
JOB.41.32	 It leaves a shining path behind it
JOB.41.32	so that the sea appears to have silvery hair.
JOB.41.33	 Nothing on land can compare to it.
JOB.41.33	It was made fearless.
JOB.41.34	 It looks down on all high things.
JOB.41.34	It is king of everyone who is arrogant.”
JOB.42.1	 Then Job answered the L
JOB.42.2	 “I know that you can do everything
JOB.42.2	and that your plans are unstoppable.
JOB.42.3	 “⌊You said,⌋ ‘Who is this that belittles my advice
JOB.42.3	without having any knowledge ⌊about it⌋?’
JOB.42.3	Yes, I have stated things I didn’t understand,
JOB.42.3	things too mysterious for me to know.
JOB.42.4	 “⌊You said,⌋ ‘Listen now, and I will speak.
JOB.42.4	I will ask you, and you will teach me.’
JOB.42.5	 I had heard about you with my own ears,
JOB.42.5	but now I have seen you with my own eyes.
JOB.42.6	 That is why I take back what I said,

JOB.42.7	 After the L
JOB.42.8	 So take seven young bulls and seven rams. Go to my servant Job, and make a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you. Then I will accept his prayer not to treat you as godless fools. After all, you didn’t speak what is right about me as my servant Job has done.”
JOB.42.9	 Then Eliphaz of Teman, Bildad of Shuah, and Zophar of Naama went and did what the L
JOB.42.10	 After Job prayed for his friends, the L

JOB.42.13	 He also had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	 He named the first ⌊daughter⌋ Jemimah, the second Cassia, and the third Keren Happuch. 
JOB.42.15	 Nowhere in the whole country could be found women who were as beautiful as Job’s daughters. Their father gave them and their brothers an inheritance.
JOB.42.16	 Job lived 140 years after this. He saw his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
JOB.42.17	 Then at a very old age, Job died.
PSA.1.1	 Blessed is the person who does not
PSA.1.1	follow the advice of wicked people,

PSA.1.3	 He is like a tree planted beside streams—
PSA.1.3	a tree that produces fruit in season
PSA.1.3	and whose leaves do not wither.
PSA.1.3	He succeeds in everything he does.
PSA.1.4	 Wicked people are not like that.
PSA.1.4	Instead, they are like husks that the wind blows away.
PSA.1.5	 That is why wicked people will not be able to stand in the judgment

PSA.1.6	but the way of wicked people will end.
PSA.2.1	 Why do the nations gather together?

PSA.2.2	 Kings take their stands.
PSA.2.2	Rulers make plans together
PSA.2.2	against the L
PSA.2.3	 “Let’s break apart their chains

PSA.2.4	 The one enthroned in heaven laughs.
PSA.2.4	The L

PSA.2.10	 Now, you kings, act wisely.
PSA.2.10	Be warned, you rulers of the earth!
PSA.2.11	 Serve the L

PSA.37.33	or condemn him when he is brought to trial.
PSA.37.34	 Wait with hope for the L
PSA.37.34	and he will honor you by giving you the land.
PSA.37.34	When wicked people are cut off, you will see it.
PSA.37.35	 I have seen a wicked person ⌊acting like⌋ a tyrant,
PSA.37.35	spreading himself out like a large cedar tree.
PSA.37.36	 But he moved on, and now there is no trace of him.
PSA.37.36	I searched for him, but he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	 Notice the innocent person,
PSA.37.37	and look at the decent person,
PSA.37.37	because the peacemaker has a future.
PSA.37.38	 But rebels will be completely destroyed.
PSA.37.38	The future of wicked people will be cut off.
PSA.37.39	 The victory for righteous people comes from the L
PSA.37.39	He is their fortress in times of trouble.
PSA.37.40	 The L
PSA.37.40	He rescues them from wicked people.
PSA.37.40	He saves them because they have taken refuge in him.
PSA.38.1	 O L
PSA.38.1	or discipline me in your wrath.
PSA.38.2	 Your arrows have struck me.
PSA.38.2	Your hand has struck me hard.
PSA.38.3	 No healthy spot is left on my body
PSA.38.3	because of your rage.
PSA.38.3	There is no peace in my bones
PSA.38.3	because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	 My guilt has overwhelmed me.
PSA.38.4	Like a heavy load, it is more than I can bear.
PSA.38.5	 My wounds smell rotten.
PSA.38.5	They fester because of my stupidity.
PSA.38.6	 I am bent over and bowed down very low.
PSA.38.6	All day I walk around in mourning.
PSA.38.7	 My insides are filled with burning pain,
PSA.38.7	and no healthy spot is left on my body.
PSA.38.8	 I am numb and completely devastated.
PSA.38.8	I roar because my heart’s in turmoil.
PSA.38.9	 You know all my desires, O Lord,
PSA.38.9	and my groaning has not been hidden from you.
PSA.38.10	 My heart is pounding.
PSA.38.10	I have lost my strength.
PSA.38.10	Even the light of my eyes has left me.
PSA.38.11	 My loved ones and my friends keep their distance
PSA.38.11	and my relatives stand far away because of my sickness.
PSA.38.12	 Those who seek my life lay traps for me.
PSA.38.12	Those who are out to harm me talk about ruining me.
PSA.38.12	All day long they think of ways to deceive me.
PSA.38.13	 But I am like a person who cannot hear
PSA.38.13	and like a person who cannot speak.
PSA.38.14	 I am like one who cannot hear
PSA.38.14	and who can offer no arguments.
PSA.38.15	 But I wait with hope for you, O L
PSA.38.15	You will answer, O Lord, my God.
PSA.38.16	 I said, “Do not let them gloat over me.
PSA.38.16	When my foot slips,
PSA.38.16	do not let them promote themselves at my expense.”
PSA.38.17	 I am ready to fall.
PSA.38.17	I am continually aware of my pain.
PSA.38.18	 I confess my guilt.
PSA.38.18	My sin troubles me.
PSA.38.19	 My mortal enemies are growing stronger.
PSA.38.19	Many hate me for no reason.
PSA.38.20	 They pay me back with evil instead of good,
PSA.38.20	and they accuse me because I try to do what is good.
PSA.38.21	 Do not abandon me, O L
PSA.38.21	O my God, do not be so distant from me.
PSA.38.22	 Come quickly to help me, O Lord, my savior.
PSA.39.1	 I said,
PSA.39.1	“I will watch my ways so that I do not sin with my tongue.
PSA.39.1	I will bridle my mouth while wicked people are in my presence.”
PSA.39.2	 I remained totally speechless.
PSA.39.2	I kept silent, although it did me no good.
PSA.39.2	While I was deep in thought, my pain grew worse.
PSA.39.3	 My heart burned like a fire flaring up within me.
PSA.39.3	Then I spoke with my tongue:
PSA.39.4	 “Teach me, O L
PSA.39.4	Teach me about the number of days I have left
PSA.39.4	so that I may know how temporary my life is.
PSA.39.5	 Indeed, you have made the length of my days ⌊only⌋ a few inches.
PSA.39.5	My life span is nothing compared to yours.
PSA.39.5	Certainly, everyone alive is like a whisper in the wind. 
PSA.39.6	 Each person who walks around is like a shadow.
PSA.39.6	They are busy for no reason.
PSA.39.6	They accumulate riches without knowing who will get them.”
PSA.39.7	 And now, Lord, what am I waiting for?
PSA.39.7	My hope is in you!
PSA.39.8	 Rescue me from all my rebellious acts.
PSA.39.8	Do not disgrace me in front of godless fools.
PSA.39.9	 I remained speechless.
PSA.39.9	I did not open my mouth
PSA.39.9	because you are the one who has done this.
PSA.39.10	 Remove the sickness you laid upon me.
PSA.39.10	My life is over because you struck me with your hand.
PSA.39.11	 With stern warnings you discipline people for their crimes.
PSA.39.11	Like a moth you eat away at what is dear to them.
PSA.39.11	Certainly, everyone is like a whisper in the wind. 
PSA.39.12	 Listen to my prayer, O L
PSA.39.12	Open your ear to my cry for help.
PSA.39.12	Do not be deaf to my tears,
PSA.39.12	for I am a foreign resident with you,
PSA.39.12	a stranger like all my ancestors.
PSA.39.13	 Look away from me so that I may smile again
PSA.39.13	before I go away and am no more.
PSA.40.1	 I waited patiently for the L
PSA.40.1	He turned to me and heard my cry for help.
PSA.40.2	 He pulled me out of a horrible pit,
PSA.40.2	out of the mud and clay.
PSA.40.2	He set my feet on a rock
PSA.40.2	and made my steps secure.
PSA.40.3	 He placed a new song in my mouth,
PSA.40.3	a song of praise to our God.
PSA.40.3	Many will see this and worship.
PSA.40.3	They will trust the L
PSA.40.4	 Blessed is the person
PSA.40.4	who places his confidence in the L
PSA.40.4	and does not rely on arrogant people
PSA.40.4	or those who follow lies.
PSA.40.5	 You have done many miraculous things, O L
PSA.40.5	You have made many wonderful plans for us.
PSA.40.5	No one compares to you!
PSA.40.5	I will tell others about your miracles,
PSA.40.5	which are more than I can count.
PSA.40.6	 You were not pleased with sacrifices and offerings.
PSA.40.6	You have dug out two ears for me.
PSA.40.6	You did not ask for burnt offerings or sacrifices for sin.
PSA.40.7	 Then I said, “I have come!
PSA.40.7	(It is written about me in the scroll of the book.)
PSA.40.8	 I am happy to do your will, O my God.”
PSA.40.8	Your teachings are deep within me.
PSA.40.9	 I will announce the good news of righteousness
PSA.40.9	among those assembled for worship.
PSA.40.9	I will not close my lips.
PSA.40.9	You know that, O L
PSA.40.10	 I have not buried your righteousness deep in my heart.
PSA.40.10	I have been outspoken about your faithfulness and your salvation.
PSA.40.10	I have not hidden your mercy and your truth
PSA.40.10	from those assembled for worship.
PSA.40.11	 Do not withhold your compassion from me, O L
PSA.40.11	May your mercy and your truth always protect me.
PSA.40.12	 Countless evils have surrounded me.
PSA.40.12	My sins have caught up with me so that I can no longer see.
PSA.40.12	They outnumber the hairs on my head.
PSA.40.12	I have lost heart.
PSA.40.13	 O L
PSA.40.13	Come quickly to help me, O L
PSA.40.14	 Let all those who seek to end my life
PSA.40.14	be confused and put to shame.
PSA.40.14	Let those who want my downfall
PSA.40.14	be turned back and disgraced.
PSA.40.15	 Let those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”
PSA.40.15	be stunned by their own shame.
PSA.40.16	 Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad because of you.
PSA.40.16	Let those who love your salvation continually say,
PSA.40.16	“The L
PSA.40.17	 But I am oppressed and needy.
PSA.40.17	May the Lord think of me.
PSA.40.17	You are my help and my savior.

PSA.41.1	 Blessed is the one who has concern for helpless people.
PSA.41.1	The L

PSA.41.2	He will be blessed in the land.
PSA.41.2	Do not place him at the mercy of his enemies.
PSA.41.3	 The L
PSA.41.3	You will restore this person to health when he is ill.
PSA.41.4	 I said, “O L
PSA.41.4	Heal my soul because I have sinned against you.”
PSA.41.5	 My enemies say terrible things about me:
PSA.41.5	“When will he die, and when will his family name disappear?”
PSA.41.6	 When one of them comes to visit me, he speaks foolishly.
PSA.41.6	His heart collects gossip.
PSA.41.6	⌊Then⌋ he leaves to tell others.
PSA.41.7	 Everyone who hates me whispers about me.
PSA.41.7	They think evil things about me and say,
PSA.41.8	 “A devilish disease has attached itself to him.
PSA.41.8	He will never leave his sickbed.”
PSA.41.9	 Even my closest friend whom I trusted,
PSA.41.9	the one who ate my bread,
PSA.41.9	has lifted his heel against me.
PSA.41.10	 Have pity on me, O L
PSA.41.10	Raise me up so that I can pay them back
PSA.41.11	 and my enemy cannot shout in triumph over me.
PSA.41.11	When you do this, I know that you are pleased with me.
PSA.41.12	 You defend my integrity,
PSA.41.12	and you set me in your presence forever.
PSA.41.13	 Thank the L
PSA.41.13	Amen and amen!
PSA.42.1	 As a deer longs for flowing streams,
PSA.42.1	so my soul longs for you, O God.
PSA.42.2	 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
PSA.42.2	When may I come to see God’s face?
PSA.42.3	 My tears are my food day and night.
PSA.42.3	People ask me all day long, “Where is your God?”
PSA.42.4	 I will remember these things as I pour out my soul:
PSA.42.4	how I used to walk with the crowd
PSA.42.4	and lead it in a procession to God’s house.
PSA.42.4	⌊I sang⌋ songs of joy and thanksgiving
PSA.42.4	while crowds of people celebrated a festival.
PSA.42.5	 Why are you discouraged, my soul?
PSA.42.5	Why are you so restless?
PSA.42.5	Put your hope in God,
PSA.42.5	because I will still praise him.
PSA.42.5	He is my savior and my God.
PSA.42.6	 My soul is discouraged.
PSA.42.6	That is why I will remember you
PSA.42.6	in the land of Jordan, on the peaks of Hermon, on Mount Mizar.
PSA.42.7	 One deep sea calls to another at the roar of your waterspouts.
PSA.42.7	All the whitecaps on your waves have swept over me.
PSA.42.8	 The L
PSA.42.8	and at night his song is with me—
PSA.42.8	a prayer to the God of my life.
PSA.42.9	 I will ask God, my rock,
PSA.42.9	“Why have you forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why must I walk around in mourning
PSA.42.9	while the enemy oppresses me?”
PSA.42.10	 With a shattering blow to my bones,
PSA.42.10	my enemies taunt me.
PSA.42.10	They ask me all day long, “Where is your God?”
PSA.42.11	 Why are you discouraged, my soul?
PSA.42.11	Why are you so restless?
PSA.42.11	Put your hope in God,
PSA.42.11	because I will still praise him.
PSA.42.11	He is my savior and my God.
PSA.43.1	 Judge me, O God,
PSA.43.1	and plead my case against an ungodly nation.
PSA.43.1	Rescue me from deceitful and unjust people.
PSA.43.2	 You are my fortress, O God!
PSA.43.2	Why have you rejected me?
PSA.43.2	Why must I walk around in mourning
PSA.43.2	while the enemy oppresses me?
PSA.43.3	 Send your light and your truth.
PSA.43.3	Let them guide me.
PSA.43.3	Let them bring me to your holy mountain
PSA.43.3	and to your dwelling place.
PSA.43.4	 Then let me go to the altar of God, to God my ⌊highest⌋ joy,
PSA.43.4	and I will give thanks to you on the lyre, O God, my God.
PSA.43.5	 Why are you discouraged, my soul?
PSA.43.5	Why are you so restless?
PSA.43.5	Put your hope in God,
PSA.43.5	because I will still praise him.
PSA.43.5	He is my savior and my God.
PSA.44.1	 O God,
PSA.44.1	we have heard it with our own ears.
PSA.44.1	Our ancestors have told us
PSA.44.1	about the miracle you performed in their day,
PSA.44.1	in days long ago.
PSA.44.2	 By your power you forced nations ⌊out of the land⌋,
PSA.44.2	but you planted our ancestors ⌊there⌋.
PSA.44.2	You shattered many groups of people,
PSA.44.2	but you set our ancestors free.
PSA.44.3	 It was not with their swords that they took possession of the land.
PSA.44.3	They did not gain victory with their own strength.
PSA.44.3	It was your right hand, your arm,
PSA.44.3	and the light of your presence ⌊that did it⌋,
PSA.44.3	because you were pleased with them.
PSA.44.4	 You alone are my king, O God.
PSA.44.4	You won those victories for Jacob.
PSA.44.5	 With you we can walk over our enemies.
PSA.44.5	With your name we can trample those who attack us.
PSA.44.6	 I do not rely on my bow,
PSA.44.6	and my sword will never save me.
PSA.44.7	 But you saved us from our enemies.
PSA.44.7	You put to shame those who hate us.
PSA.44.8	 All day long we praise our God.
PSA.44.8	We give thanks to you forever. 
PSA.44.9	 But now you have rejected and disgraced us.
PSA.44.9	You do not even go along with our armies.
PSA.44.10	 You make us retreat from the enemy.
PSA.44.10	Those who hate us rob us at will.
PSA.44.11	 You hand us over to be butchered like sheep
PSA.44.11	and scatter us among the nations.
PSA.44.12	 You sell your people for almost nothing,
PSA.44.12	and at that price you have gained nothing.
PSA.44.13	 You made us a disgrace to our neighbors
PSA.44.13	and an object of ridicule and contempt to those around us.
PSA.44.14	 You made our ⌊defeat⌋ a proverb among the nations
PSA.44.14	so that people shake their heads at us.
PSA.44.15	 All day long my disgrace is in front of me.
PSA.44.15	Shame covers my face
PSA.44.16	 because of the words of those who insult and slander us,
PSA.44.16	because of the presence of the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.44.17	 Although all of this happened to us,
PSA.44.17	we never forgot you.
PSA.44.17	We never ignored your promise.
PSA.44.18	 Our hearts never turned away.
PSA.44.18	Our feet never left your path.
PSA.44.19	 Yet, you crushed us in a place for jackals
PSA.44.19	and covered us with the shadow of death.
PSA.44.20	 If we forgot the name of our God
PSA.44.20	or stretched out our hands to pray to another god,
PSA.44.21	 wouldn’t God find out,
PSA.44.21	since he knows the secrets in our hearts?
PSA.44.22	 Indeed, we are being killed all day long because of you.
PSA.44.22	We are thought of as sheep to be slaughtered.
PSA.44.23	 Wake up! Why are you sleeping, O Lord?
PSA.44.23	Awake! Do not reject us forever!
PSA.44.24	 Why do you hide your face?
PSA.44.24	Why do you forget our suffering and misery?
PSA.44.25	 Our souls are bowing in the dust.
PSA.44.25	Our bodies cling to the ground.
PSA.44.26	 Arise! Help us!
PSA.44.26	Rescue us because of your mercy!
PSA.45.1	 My heart is overflowing with good news.
PSA.45.1	I will direct my song to the king.
PSA.45.1	My tongue is a pen for a skillful writer.
PSA.45.2	 You are the most handsome of Adam’s descendants.
PSA.45.2	Grace is poured on your lips.
PSA.45.2	That is why God has blessed you forever.
PSA.45.3	 O warrior, strap your sword to your side
PSA.45.3	with your splendor and majesty.
PSA.45.4	 Ride on victoriously in your majesty
PSA.45.4	for the cause of truth, humility, and righteousness.
PSA.45.4	Let your right hand teach you awe-inspiring things.
PSA.45.5	 Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies.
PSA.45.5	Nations fall beneath you.
PSA.45.6	 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
PSA.45.6	The scepter in your kingdom is a scepter for justice.
PSA.45.7	 You have loved what is right and hated what is wrong.
PSA.45.7	That is why God, your God, has anointed you,
PSA.45.7	rather than your companions, with the oil of joy.
PSA.45.8	 All your robes are ⌊fragrant⌋ with myrrh, aloes, and cassia.
PSA.45.8	From ivory palaces the music of stringed instruments delights you.
PSA.45.9	 The daughters of kings are among your noble ladies.
PSA.45.9	The queen takes her place at your right hand
PSA.45.9	and wears gold from Ophir.
PSA.45.10	 Listen, daughter! Look closely!
PSA.45.10	Turn your ear ⌊toward me⌋.
PSA.45.10	Forget your people, and forget your father’s house.
PSA.45.11	 The king longs for your beauty.
PSA.45.11	He is your Lord.
PSA.45.11	Worship him.
PSA.45.12	 The people of Tyre, the richest people,
PSA.45.12	want to win your favor with a gift.
PSA.45.13	 The daughter of the king is glorious inside ⌊the palace⌋.
PSA.45.13	Her dress is embroidered with gold.
PSA.45.14	 Wearing a colorful gown, she is brought to the king.
PSA.45.14	Her bridesmaids follow her.
PSA.45.14	They will be brought to you.
PSA.45.15	 With joy and delight they are brought in.
PSA.45.15	They enter the palace of the king.
PSA.45.16	 Your sons will take the place of your father.
PSA.45.16	You will make them princes over the whole earth.
PSA.45.17	 I will cause your name to be remembered throughout every generation.
PSA.45.17	That is why the nations will give thanks to you forever and ever.
PSA.46.1	 God is our refuge and strength,
PSA.46.1	an ever-present help in times of trouble.
PSA.46.2	 That is why we are not afraid
PSA.46.2	even when the earth quakes
PSA.46.2	or the mountains topple into the depths of the sea.
PSA.46.3	 Water roars and foams,
PSA.46.3	and mountains shake at the surging waves. 
PSA.46.4	 There is a river
PSA.46.4	whose streams bring joy to the city of God,
PSA.46.4	the holy place where the Most High lives.
PSA.46.5	 God is in that city.
PSA.46.5	It cannot fall.
PSA.46.5	God will help it at the break of dawn.
PSA.46.6	 Nations are in turmoil, and kingdoms topple.
PSA.46.6	The earth melts at the sound of ⌊God’s⌋ voice.
PSA.46.7	 The L
PSA.46.7	The God of Jacob is our stronghold. 
PSA.46.8	 Come, see the works of the L
PSA.46.8	the devastation he has brought to the earth.
PSA.46.9	 He puts an end to wars all over the earth.
PSA.46.9	He breaks an archer’s bow.
PSA.46.9	He cuts spears in two.
PSA.46.9	He burns chariots.
PSA.46.10	 Let go ⌊of your concerns⌋!
PSA.46.10	Then you will know that I am God.
PSA.46.10	I rule the nations.
PSA.46.10	I rule the earth.
PSA.46.11	 The L
PSA.46.11	The God of Jacob is our stronghold. 
PSA.47.1	 Clap your hands, all you people.
PSA.47.1	Shout to God with a loud, joyful song.
PSA.47.2	 We must fear the L
PSA.47.2	He is the great king of the whole earth.
PSA.47.3	 He brings people under our authority
PSA.47.3	and ⌊puts⌋ nations under our feet.
PSA.47.4	 He chooses our inheritance for us,
PSA.47.4	the pride of Jacob, whom he loved. 
PSA.47.5	 God has gone up with a joyful shout.
PSA.47.5	The L
PSA.47.6	 Make music to praise God.
PSA.47.6	Play music for him!
PSA.47.6	Make music to praise our king.
PSA.47.6	Play music for him!
PSA.47.7	 God is the king of the whole earth.
PSA.47.7	Make your best music for him!
PSA.47.8	 God rules the nations.
PSA.47.8	He sits upon his holy throne.
PSA.47.9	 The influential people from the nations gather together
PSA.47.9	as the people of the God of Abraham.
PSA.47.9	The rulers of the earth belong to God.
PSA.47.9	He rules everything.
PSA.48.1	 The L
PSA.48.1	He should be highly praised.
PSA.48.1	His holy mountain is in the city of our God.
PSA.48.2	 Its beautiful peak is the joy of the whole earth.
PSA.48.2	Mount Zion is on the northern ridge.
PSA.48.2	It is the city of the great king.
PSA.48.3	 God is in its palaces.
PSA.48.3	He has proved that he is a stronghold.
PSA.48.4	 The kings have gathered.
PSA.48.4	They marched together.
PSA.48.5	 ⌊When⌋ they saw ⌊Mount Zion⌋,
PSA.48.5	they were astonished.
PSA.48.5	They were terrified and ran away in fear.
PSA.48.6	 Trembling seized them
PSA.48.6	like the trembling that a woman experiences during labor.
PSA.48.7	 With the east wind you smash the ships of Tarshish.
PSA.48.8	 The things we had only heard about, we have now seen
PSA.48.8	in the city of the L
PSA.48.8	in the city of our God.
PSA.48.8	God makes Zion stand firm forever. 
PSA.48.9	 Inside your temple we carefully reflect on your mercy, O God.
PSA.48.10	 Like your name, O God,
PSA.48.10	your praise ⌊reaches⌋ to the ends of the earth.
PSA.48.10	Your right hand is filled with righteousness.
PSA.48.11	 Let Mount Zion be glad
PSA.48.11	and the cities of Judah rejoice
PSA.48.11	because of your judgments.
PSA.48.12	 Walk around Zion.
PSA.48.12	Go around it.
PSA.48.12	Count its towers.
PSA.48.13	 Examine its embankments.
PSA.48.13	Walk through its palaces.
PSA.48.13	Then you can tell the next generation,
PSA.48.14	 “This God is our God forever and ever.
PSA.48.14	He will lead us beyond death.”
PSA.49.1	 Listen to this, all you people.
PSA.49.1	Open your ears, all who live in the world—
PSA.49.2	 common people and important ones,
PSA.49.2	rich people and poor ones.
PSA.49.3	 My mouth will speak wise sayings,
PSA.49.3	the insights I have carefully considered.
PSA.49.4	 I will turn my attention to a proverb.
PSA.49.4	I will explain my riddle with the ⌊music of⌋ a lyre.
PSA.49.5	 Why should I be afraid in times of trouble,
PSA.49.5	when slanderers surround me with evil?
PSA.49.6	 They trust their riches
PSA.49.6	and brag about their abundant wealth.
PSA.49.7	 No one can ever buy back another person
PSA.49.7	or pay God a ransom for his life.
PSA.49.8	 The price to be paid for his soul is too costly.
PSA.49.8	He must always give up
PSA.49.9	 in order to live forever and never see the pit.
PSA.49.10	 Indeed, one can see that wise people die,
PSA.49.10	that foolish and stupid people meet the same end.
PSA.49.10	They leave their riches to others.
PSA.49.11	 Although they named their lands after themselves,
PSA.49.11	their graves 
PSA.49.11	their dwelling places throughout every generation.
PSA.49.12	 But mortals will not continue here with what they treasure.
PSA.49.12	They are like animals that die.
PSA.49.13	 This is the final outcome for fools and their followers
PSA.49.13	who are delighted by what they say: 
PSA.49.14	 Like sheep, they are driven to hell
PSA.49.14	with death as their shepherd.
PSA.49.14	(Decent people will rule them in the morning.)
PSA.49.14	Their forms will decay in the grave,
PSA.49.14	far away from their comfortable homes.
PSA.49.15	 But God will buy me back from the power of hell
PSA.49.15	because he will take me. 
PSA.49.16	 Do not be afraid when someone becomes rich,
PSA.49.16	when the greatness of his house increases.
PSA.49.17	 He will not take anything with him when he dies.
PSA.49.17	His greatness cannot follow him.
PSA.49.18	 Even though he blesses himself while he is alive
PSA.49.18	(and they praise you when you do well for yourself),
PSA.49.19	 he must join the generation of his ancestors,
PSA.49.19	who will never see light ⌊again⌋.
PSA.49.20	 Mortals, with what they treasure, still don’t have understanding.
PSA.49.20	They are like animals that die.
PSA.50.1	 The L
PSA.50.1	He has summoned the earth
PSA.50.1	from where the sun rises to where it sets.
PSA.50.2	 God shines from Zion,
PSA.50.2	the perfection of beauty.
PSA.50.3	 Our God will come and will not remain silent.
PSA.50.3	A devouring fire is in front of him
PSA.50.3	and a raging storm around him.
PSA.50.4	 He summons heaven and earth to judge his people:
PSA.50.5	 “Gather around me, my godly people
PSA.50.5	who have made a pledge to me through sacrifices.”
PSA.50.6	 The heavens announce his righteousness
PSA.50.6	because God is the judge. 
PSA.50.7	 “Listen, my people, and I will speak.
PSA.50.7	Listen, Israel, and I will testify against you:
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God!
PSA.50.8	 I am not criticizing you for your sacrifices or burnt offerings,
PSA.50.8	which are always in front of me.
PSA.50.9	 ⌊But⌋ I will not accept ⌊another⌋ young bull from your household
PSA.50.9	or a single male goat from your pens.
PSA.50.10	 Every creature in the forest,
PSA.50.10	⌊even⌋ the cattle on a thousand hills, is mine.
PSA.50.11	 I know every bird in the mountains.
PSA.50.11	Everything that moves in the fields is mine.
PSA.50.12	 If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
PSA.50.12	because the world and all that it contains are mine.
PSA.50.13	 Do I eat the meat of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	 Bring ⌊your⌋ thanks to God as a sacrifice,
PSA.50.14	and keep your vows to the Most High.
PSA.50.15	 Call on me in times of trouble.
PSA.50.15	I will rescue you, and you will honor me.”
PSA.50.16	 But God says to wicked people,
PSA.50.16	“How dare you quote my decrees
PSA.50.16	and mouth my promises! 
PSA.50.17	 You hate discipline.
PSA.50.17	You toss my words behind you.
PSA.50.18	 When you see a thief, you want to make friends with him.
PSA.50.18	You keep company with people who commit adultery.
PSA.50.19	 You let your mouth say anything evil.
PSA.50.19	Your tongue plans deceit.
PSA.50.20	 You sit and talk against your own brother.
PSA.50.20	You slander your own mother’s son.
PSA.50.21	 When you did these things, I remained silent.
PSA.50.21	⌊That⌋ made you think I was like you.
PSA.50.21	I will argue my point with you
PSA.50.21	and lay it all out for you to see.
PSA.50.22	 Consider this, you people who forget God.
PSA.50.22	Otherwise, I will tear you to pieces,
PSA.50.22	and there will be no one left to rescue you.
PSA.50.23	 Whoever offers thanks as a sacrifice honors me.
PSA.50.23	I will let everyone who continues in my way
PSA.50.23	see the salvation that comes from God.”
PSA.51.1	 Have pity on me, O God, in keeping with your mercy.
PSA.51.1	In keeping with your unlimited compassion, wipe out my rebellious acts.
PSA.51.2	 Wash me thoroughly from my guilt,
PSA.51.2	and cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	 I admit that I am rebellious.
PSA.51.3	My sin is always in front of me.
PSA.51.4	 I have sinned against you, especially you.
PSA.51.4	I have done what you consider evil.
PSA.51.4	So you hand down justice when you speak,
PSA.51.4	and you are blameless when you judge.
PSA.51.5	 Indeed, I was born guilty.
PSA.51.5	I was a sinner when my mother conceived me.
PSA.51.6	 Yet, you desire truth and sincerity.
PSA.51.6	Deep down inside me you teach me wisdom.
PSA.51.7	 Purify me from sin with hyssop,
PSA.51.7	Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	 Let me hear ⌊sounds of⌋ joy and gladness.
PSA.51.8	Let the bones that you have broken dance.
PSA.51.9	 Hide your face from my sins,
PSA.51.9	and wipe out all that I have done wrong.
PSA.51.10	 Create a clean heart in me, O God,
PSA.51.10	and renew a faithful spirit within me.
PSA.51.11	 Do not force me away from your presence,
PSA.51.11	and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	 Restore the joy of your salvation to me,
PSA.51.12	and provide me with a spirit of willing obedience.
PSA.51.13	 ⌊Then⌋ I will teach your ways to those who are rebellious,
PSA.51.13	and sinners will return to you.
PSA.51.14	 Rescue me from the guilt of murder,
PSA.51.14	O God, my savior.
PSA.51.14	Let my tongue sing joyfully about your righteousness!
PSA.51.15	 O Lord, open my lips,
PSA.51.15	and my mouth will tell about your praise.
PSA.51.16	 You are not happy with any sacrifice.
PSA.51.16	Otherwise, I would offer one ⌊to you⌋.
PSA.51.16	You are not pleased with burnt offerings.
PSA.51.17	 The sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit.
PSA.51.17	O God, you do not despise a broken and sorrowful heart.
PSA.51.18	 Favor Zion with your goodness.
PSA.51.18	Rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	 Then you will be pleased with sacrifices offered in the right spirit—
PSA.51.19	with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings.
PSA.51.19	Young bulls will be offered on your altar.
PSA.52.1	 Why do you brag about the evil you’ve done, you hero?
PSA.52.1	The mercy of God lasts all day long!
PSA.52.2	 Your tongue makes up threats.
PSA.52.2	It’s like a sharp razor, you master of deceit.
PSA.52.3	 You prefer evil to good.
PSA.52.3	You prefer lying to speaking the truth. 
PSA.52.4	 You love every destructive accusation, you deceitful tongue!
PSA.52.5	 But God will ruin you forever.
PSA.52.5	He will grab you and drag you out of your tent.
PSA.52.5	He will pull your roots out of this world of the living. 
PSA.52.6	 Righteous people will see ⌊this⌋ and be struck with fear.
PSA.52.6	They will laugh at you and say,
PSA.52.7	 “Look at this person who refused to make God his fortress!
PSA.52.7	Instead, he trusted his great wealth
PSA.52.7	and became strong through his greed.”
PSA.52.8	 But I am like a large olive tree in God’s house.
PSA.52.8	I trust the mercy of God forever and ever.
PSA.52.9	 I will give thanks to you forever
PSA.52.9	for what you have done.
PSA.52.9	In the presence of your godly people,
PSA.52.9	I will wait with hope in your good name.
PSA.53.1	 Godless fools say in their hearts,
PSA.53.1	“There is no God.”
PSA.53.1	They are corrupt.
PSA.53.1	They do disgusting things.
PSA.53.1	There is no one who does good things.
PSA.53.2	 God looks down from heaven on Adam’s descendants
PSA.53.2	to see if there is anyone who acts wisely,
PSA.53.2	if there is anyone who seeks help from God.
PSA.53.3	 Everyone has fallen away.
PSA.53.3	Together they have become rotten to the core.
PSA.53.3	No one, not even one person, does good things.
PSA.53.4	 Are all those troublemakers,
PSA.53.4	those who devour my people as if they were devouring food,
PSA.53.4	so ignorant that they do not call on God?
PSA.53.5	 There they are—panic-stricken—
PSA.53.5	⌊but⌋ there was no reason to panic,
PSA.53.5	because God has scattered the bones
PSA.53.5	of those who set up camp against you.
PSA.53.5	You put them to shame.
PSA.53.5	After all, God has rejected them.
PSA.53.6	 If only salvation for Israel would come from Zion!
PSA.53.6	When God restores the fortunes of his people,
PSA.53.6	Jacob will rejoice.
PSA.53.6	Israel will be glad.
PSA.54.1	 O God, save me by your name,
PSA.54.1	and defend me with your might.
PSA.54.2	 O God, hear my prayer,
PSA.54.2	and open your ears to the words from my mouth.
PSA.54.3	 Strangers have attacked me.
PSA.54.3	Ruthless people seek my life.
PSA.54.3	They do not think about God.
PSA.54.4	 God is my helper!
PSA.54.4	The Lord is the provider for my life.
PSA.54.5	 My enemies spy on me.
PSA.54.5	Pay them back with evil.
PSA.54.5	Destroy them with your truth!
PSA.54.6	 I will make a sacrifice to you along with a freewill offering.
PSA.54.6	I will give thanks to your good name, O L
PSA.54.7	 Your name rescues me from every trouble.
PSA.54.7	My eyes will gloat over my enemies.
PSA.55.1	 Open your ears to my prayer, O God.
PSA.55.1	Do not hide from my plea for mercy.
PSA.55.2	 Pay attention to me, and answer me.
PSA.55.2	My thoughts are restless, and I am confused
PSA.55.3	 because my enemy shouts at me
PSA.55.3	and a wicked person persecutes me.
PSA.55.3	They bring misery crashing down on me,
PSA.55.3	and they attack me out of anger.
PSA.55.4	 My heart is in turmoil.
PSA.55.4	The terrors of death have seized me.
PSA.55.5	 Fear and trembling have overcome me.
PSA.55.5	Horror has overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	 I said, “If only I had wings like a dove—
PSA.55.6	I would fly away and find rest.
PSA.55.7	 Indeed, I would run far away.
PSA.55.7	I would stay in the desert. 
PSA.55.8	 I would hurry to find shelter
PSA.55.8	from the raging wind and storm.”
PSA.55.9	 Completely confuse their language, O Lord,
PSA.55.9	because I see violence and conflict in the city.
PSA.55.10	 Day and night they go around on ⌊top of⌋ the city walls.
PSA.55.10	Trouble and misery are everywhere.
PSA.55.11	 Destruction is everywhere.
PSA.55.11	Oppression and fraud never leave the streets.
PSA.55.12	 If an enemy had insulted me,
PSA.55.12	then I could bear it.
PSA.55.12	If someone who hated me had attacked me,
PSA.55.12	then I could hide from him.
PSA.55.13	 But it is you, my equal,
PSA.55.13	my best friend,
PSA.55.13	one I knew so well!
PSA.55.14	 We used to talk to each other in complete confidence
PSA.55.14	and walk into God’s house with the festival crowds.
PSA.55.15	 Let death suddenly take ⌊wicked people⌋!
PSA.55.15	Let them go into the grave while they are still alive,
PSA.55.15	because evil lives in their homes as well as in their hearts.
PSA.55.16	 But I call on God,
PSA.55.16	and the L
PSA.55.17	 Morning, noon, and night I complain and groan,
PSA.55.17	and he listens to my voice.
PSA.55.18	 With ⌊his⌋ peace, he will rescue my soul
PSA.55.18	from the war waged against me,
PSA.55.18	because there are many ⌊soldiers fighting⌋ against me.
PSA.55.19	 God will listen.
PSA.55.19	The one who has sat enthroned from the beginning
PSA.55.19	will deal with them. 
PSA.55.19	They never change. They never fear God.
PSA.55.20	 ⌊My best friend⌋ has betrayed his friends.
PSA.55.20	He has broken his solemn promise.
PSA.55.21	 His speech is smoother than butter,
PSA.55.21	but there is war in his heart.
PSA.55.21	His words are more soothing than oil,
PSA.55.21	but they are like swords ready to attack.
PSA.55.22	 Turn your burdens over to the L
PSA.55.22	and he will take care of you.
PSA.55.22	He will never let the righteous person stumble.
PSA.55.23	 But you, O God, will throw ⌊wicked people⌋ into the deepest pit.
PSA.55.23	Bloodthirsty and deceitful people will not live out half their days.
PSA.55.23	But I will trust you.
PSA.56.1	 Have pity on me, O God, because people are harassing me.
PSA.56.1	All day long warriors oppress me.
PSA.56.2	 All day long my enemies spy on me.
PSA.56.2	They harass me.
PSA.56.2	There are so many fighting against me.
PSA.56.3	 Even when I am afraid, I still trust you.
PSA.56.4	 I praise the word of God.
PSA.56.4	I trust God.
PSA.56.4	I am not afraid.
PSA.56.4	What can mere flesh ⌊and blood⌋ do to me?
PSA.56.5	 All day long my enemies twist my words.
PSA.56.5	Their every thought is an evil plan against me.
PSA.56.6	 They attack, and then they hide.
PSA.56.6	They watch my every step as they wait to take my life.
PSA.56.7	 With the wrong they do, can they escape?
PSA.56.7	O God, angrily make the nations fall.
PSA.56.8	 (You have kept a record of my wanderings.
PSA.56.8	Put my tears in your bottle.
PSA.56.8	They are already in your book.)
PSA.56.9	 Then my enemies will retreat when I call ⌊to you⌋.
PSA.56.9	This I know: God is on my side.
PSA.56.10	 I praise the word of God.
PSA.56.10	I praise the word of the L
PSA.56.11	 I trust God.
PSA.56.11	I am not afraid.
PSA.56.11	What can mortals do to me?
PSA.56.12	 I am bound by my vows to you, O God.
PSA.56.12	I will keep my vows by offering songs of thanksgiving to you.
PSA.56.13	 You have rescued me from death.
PSA.56.13	You have kept my feet from stumbling
PSA.56.13	so that I could walk in your presence, in the light of life.
PSA.57.1	 Have pity on me, O God. Have pity on me,
PSA.57.1	because my soul takes refuge in you.
PSA.57.1	I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings
PSA.57.1	until destructive storms pass by.
PSA.57.2	 I call to God Most High,
PSA.57.2	to the God who does everything for me.
PSA.57.3	 He sends his help from heaven and saves me.
PSA.57.3	He disgraces the one who is harassing me. 
PSA.57.3	God sends his mercy and his truth!
PSA.57.4	 My soul is surrounded by lions.
PSA.57.4	I must lie down with man-eating lions.
PSA.57.4	Their teeth are spears and arrows.
PSA.57.4	Their tongues are sharp swords.
PSA.57.5	 May you be honored above the heavens, O God.
PSA.57.5	Let your glory extend over the whole earth.
PSA.57.6	 ⌊My enemies⌋ spread out a net to catch me.
PSA.57.6	(My soul is bowed down.) 
PSA.57.6	They dug a pit to trap me,
PSA.57.6	but then they fell into it. 
PSA.57.7	 My heart is confident, O God.
PSA.57.7	My heart is confident.
PSA.57.7	I want to sing and make music.
PSA.57.8	 Wake up, my soul! 
PSA.57.8	Wake up, harp and lyre!
PSA.57.8	I want to wake up at dawn.
PSA.57.9	 I want to give thanks to you among the people, O Lord.
PSA.57.9	I want to make music to praise you among the nations
PSA.57.10	 because your mercy is as high as the heavens.
PSA.57.10	Your truth reaches the skies.
PSA.57.11	 May you be honored above the heavens, O God.
PSA.57.11	Let your glory extend over the whole earth.
PSA.58.1	 Do you rulers really give fair verdicts?
PSA.58.1	Do you judge Adam’s descendants fairly?
PSA.58.2	 No, you invent new crimes on earth,
PSA.58.2	and your hands spread violence.
PSA.58.3	 ⌊Even⌋ inside the womb wicked people are strangers ⌊to God⌋.
PSA.58.3	From their birth liars go astray.
PSA.58.4	 They have poisonous venom like snakes.
PSA.58.4	They are like a deaf cobra that shuts its ears
PSA.58.5	 so that it cannot hear the voice of a snake charmer
PSA.58.5	or of anyone trained to cast spells.
PSA.58.6	 O God, knock the teeth out of their mouths.
PSA.58.6	Break the young lions’ teeth, O L
PSA.58.7	 Let them disappear like water that drains away.
PSA.58.7	When they aim their bows, let their arrows miss the target.
PSA.58.8	 Let them become like a snail that leaves behind a slimy trail
PSA.58.8	or like a stillborn child who never sees the sun.
PSA.58.9	 Let ⌊God⌋ sweep them away
PSA.58.9	faster than a cooking pot is heated by burning twigs.
PSA.58.10	 Righteous people will rejoice when they see ⌊God⌋ take revenge.
PSA.58.10	They will wash their feet in the blood of wicked people.
PSA.58.11	 Then people will say,
PSA.58.11	“Righteous people certainly have a reward.
PSA.58.11	There is a God who judges on earth.”
PSA.59.1	 Rescue me from my enemies, O my God.
PSA.59.1	Protect me from those who attack me.
PSA.59.2	 Rescue me from troublemakers.
PSA.59.2	Save me from bloodthirsty people.
PSA.59.3	 They lie in ambush for me right here!
PSA.59.3	Fierce men attack me, O L
PSA.59.3	but not because of any disobedience,
PSA.59.4	 or any sin, or any guilt on my part.
PSA.59.4	They hurry to take positions against me.
PSA.59.4	Wake up, and help me; see ⌊for yourself⌋.
PSA.59.5	 O L
PSA.59.5	arise to punish all the nations.
PSA.59.5	Have no pity on any traitors. 
PSA.59.6	 They return in the evening.
PSA.59.6	They howl like dogs.
PSA.59.6	They prowl the city.
PSA.59.7	 See what pours out of their mouths—
PSA.59.7	swords from their lips!
PSA.59.7	⌊They think,⌋ “Who will hear us?”
PSA.59.8	 O L
PSA.59.8	You make fun of all the nations.
PSA.59.9	 O my strength, I watch for you!
PSA.59.9	God is my stronghold, my merciful God!
PSA.59.10	 God will come to meet me.
PSA.59.10	He will let me gloat over those who spy on me.
PSA.59.11	 Do not kill them.
PSA.59.11	Otherwise, my people may forget.
PSA.59.11	Make them wander aimlessly by your power.
PSA.59.11	Bring them down, O Lord, our shield,
PSA.59.12	 ⌊because of⌋ the sins from their mouths
PSA.59.12	and the words on their lips.
PSA.59.12	Let them be trapped by their own arrogance
PSA.59.12	because they speak curses and lies.
PSA.59.13	 Destroy them in your rage.
PSA.59.13	Destroy them until not one of them is left.
PSA.59.13	Then they will know that God rules Jacob
PSA.59.13	to the ends of the earth. 
PSA.59.14	 They return in the evening.
PSA.59.14	They howl like dogs.
PSA.59.14	They prowl the city.
PSA.59.15	 They wander around to find something to eat.
PSA.59.15	If they are not full enough,
PSA.59.15	they will stay all night.
PSA.59.16	 But I will sing about your strength.
PSA.59.16	In the morning I will joyfully sing about your mercy.
PSA.59.16	You have been my stronghold
PSA.59.16	and a place of safety in times of trouble.
PSA.59.17	 O my strength, I will make music to praise you!
PSA.59.17	God is my stronghold, my merciful God!
PSA.60.1	 O God, you have rejected us.
PSA.60.1	You have broken down our defenses.
PSA.60.1	You have been angry.
PSA.60.1	Restore us!
PSA.60.2	 You made the land quake.
PSA.60.2	You split it wide open.
PSA.60.2	Heal the cracks in it
PSA.60.2	because it is falling apart.
PSA.60.3	 You have made your people experience hardships.
PSA.60.3	You have given us wine that makes us stagger.
PSA.60.4	 Yet, you have raised a flag for those who fear you
PSA.60.4	so that they can rally to it
PSA.60.4	when attacked by bows ⌊and arrows⌋. 
PSA.60.5	 Save ⌊us⌋ with your powerful hand, and answer us
PSA.60.5	so that those who are dear to you may be rescued.
PSA.60.6	 God has promised the following through his holiness:
PSA.60.6	“I will triumph!
PSA.60.6	I will divide Shechem.
PSA.60.6	I will measure the valley of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	 Gilead is mine.
PSA.60.7	Manasseh is mine.
PSA.60.7	Ephraim is the helmet on my head.
PSA.60.7	Judah is my scepter.
PSA.60.8	 Moab is my washtub.
PSA.60.8	I will throw my shoe over Edom.
PSA.60.8	I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”
PSA.60.9	 Who will bring me into the fortified city?
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	 Isn’t it you, O God, who rejected us?
PSA.60.10	Isn’t it you, O God, who refused to accompany our armies?
PSA.60.11	 Give us help against the enemy
PSA.60.11	because human assistance is worthless.
PSA.60.12	 With God we will display great strength.
PSA.60.12	He will trample our enemies.
PSA.61.1	 Listen to my cry for help, O God.
PSA.61.1	Pay attention to my prayer.
PSA.61.2	 From the ends of the earth, I call to you
PSA.61.2	when I begin to lose heart.
PSA.61.2	Lead me to the rock that is high above me.
PSA.61.3	 You have been my refuge,
PSA.61.3	a tower of strength against the enemy.
PSA.61.4	 I would like to be a guest in your tent forever
PSA.61.4	and to take refuge under the protection of your wings. 
PSA.61.5	 O God, you have heard my vows.
PSA.61.5	You have given me the inheritance
PSA.61.5	that belongs to those who fear your name.
PSA.61.6	 Add days upon days to the life of the king.
PSA.61.6	May his years endure throughout every generation.
PSA.61.7	 May he sit enthroned in the presence of God forever.
PSA.61.7	May mercy and truth protect him.
PSA.61.8	 Then I will make music to praise your name forever,
PSA.61.8	as I keep my vows day after day.
PSA.62.1	 My soul waits calmly for God alone.
PSA.62.1	My salvation comes from him.
PSA.62.2	 He alone is my rock and my savior—my stronghold.
PSA.62.2	I cannot be severely shaken.
PSA.62.3	 How long will all of you attack a person?
PSA.62.3	How long will you try to murder him,
PSA.62.3	as though he were a leaning wall or a sagging fence?
PSA.62.4	 They plan to force him out of his high position.
PSA.62.4	They are happy to lie.
PSA.62.4	They bless with their mouths,
PSA.62.4	but in their hearts they curse. 
PSA.62.5	 Wait calmly for God alone, my soul,
PSA.62.5	because my hope comes from him.
PSA.62.6	 He alone is my rock and my savior—my stronghold.
PSA.62.6	I cannot be shaken.
PSA.62.7	 My salvation and my glory depend on God.
PSA.62.7	God is the rock of my strength, my refuge.
PSA.62.8	 Trust him at all times, you people.
PSA.62.8	Pour out your hearts in his presence.
PSA.62.8	God is our refuge. 
PSA.62.9	 Common people are only a whisper in the wind.
PSA.62.9	Important people are only a delusion.
PSA.62.9	When all of them are weighed on a scale, they amount to nothing.
PSA.62.9	They are less than a whisper in the wind.
PSA.62.10	 Do not count on extortion ⌊to make you rich⌋.
PSA.62.10	Do not hope to gain anything through robbery.
PSA.62.10	When riches increase, do not depend on them.
PSA.62.11	 God has spoken once.
PSA.62.11	I have heard it ⌊said⌋ twice:
PSA.62.11	“Power belongs to God.
PSA.62.12	 Mercy belongs to you, O Lord.
PSA.62.12	You reward a person based on what he has done.”
PSA.63.1	 O God, you are my God.

PSA.73.1	to those whose lives are pure.
PSA.73.2	 But my feet had almost stumbled.
PSA.73.2	They had almost slipped
PSA.73.3	 because I was envious of arrogant people
PSA.73.3	when I saw the prosperity that wicked people enjoy.
PSA.73.4	 They suffer no pain.
PSA.73.4	Their bodies are healthy.
PSA.73.5	 They have no drudgery in their lives like ordinary people.
PSA.73.5	They are not plagued ⌊with problems⌋ like others.
PSA.73.6	 That is why they wear arrogance like a necklace
PSA.73.6	and acts of violence like clothing.
PSA.73.7	 Their eyes peer out from their fat faces,
PSA.73.7	and their imaginations run wild.
PSA.73.8	 They ridicule.
PSA.73.8	They speak maliciously.
PSA.73.8	They speak arrogantly about oppression.
PSA.73.9	 They verbally attack heaven,
PSA.73.9	and they order people around on earth.
PSA.73.10	 That is why God’s people turn to wickedness 
PSA.73.10	and swallow their words.
PSA.73.11	 Then wicked people ask, “What does God know?”
PSA.73.11	“Does the Most High know anything?”
PSA.73.12	 Look how wicked they are!
PSA.73.12	They never have a worry.
PSA.73.12	They grow more and more wealthy.
PSA.73.13	 I’ve received no reward for keeping my life pure
PSA.73.13	and washing my hands of any blame.
PSA.73.14	 I’m plagued ⌊with problems⌋ all day long,
PSA.73.14	and every morning my punishment ⌊begins again⌋.
PSA.73.15	 If I had said, “I will continue to talk like that,”
PSA.73.15	I would have betrayed God’s people.
PSA.73.16	 But when I tried to understand this,
PSA.73.16	it was too difficult for me.
PSA.73.17	 Only when I came into God’s holy place
PSA.73.17	did I ⌊finally⌋ understand what would happen to them.
PSA.73.18	 You put them in slippery places
PSA.73.18	and make them fall into ruin.
PSA.73.19	 They are suddenly destroyed.
PSA.73.19	They are completely swept away by terror!
PSA.73.20	 As ⌊someone⌋ gets rid of a dream when he wakes up,
PSA.73.20	so you, O Lord, get rid of the thought of them
PSA.73.20	when you wake up.
PSA.73.21	 When my heart was filled with bitterness
PSA.73.21	and my mind was seized ⌊with envy⌋,
PSA.73.22	 I was stupid, and I did not understand.
PSA.73.22	I was like a dumb animal in your presence.
PSA.73.23	 Yet, I am always with you.
PSA.73.23	You hold on to my right hand.
PSA.73.24	 With your advice you guide me,
PSA.73.24	and in the end you will take me to glory.
PSA.73.25	 As long as I have you,
PSA.73.25	I don’t need anyone else in heaven or on earth.
PSA.73.26	 My body and mind may waste away,
PSA.73.26	but God remains the foundation of my life
PSA.73.26	and my inheritance forever.
PSA.73.27	 Without a doubt, those who are far from you will die.
PSA.73.27	You destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
PSA.73.28	 Being united with God is my highest good.
PSA.73.28	I have made the Almighty L
PSA.73.28	so that I may report everything that he has done.
PSA.74.1	 Why, O God, have you rejected us forever?
PSA.74.1	Why does your anger
PSA.74.1	smolder against the sheep in your care?
PSA.74.2	 Remember your congregation.
PSA.74.2	Long ago you made it your own.
PSA.74.2	You bought this tribe to be your possession.
PSA.74.2	This tribe is Mount Zion, where you have made your home.
PSA.74.3	 Turn your steps toward 
PSA.74.3	The enemy has destroyed everything in the holy temple.
PSA.74.4	 Your opponents have roared inside your meeting place.
PSA.74.4	They have set up their own emblems as symbols.
PSA.74.5	 Starting from its entrance, they hacked away
PSA.74.5	like a woodcutter in a forest.
PSA.74.6	 They smashed all its carved paneling with axes and hatchets.
PSA.74.7	 They burned your holy place to the ground.
PSA.74.7	They dishonored the place where you live among us.
PSA.74.8	 They said to themselves, “We will crush them.”
PSA.74.8	They burned every meeting place of God in the land.
PSA.74.9	 We no longer see miraculous signs.
PSA.74.9	There are no prophets anymore.
PSA.74.9	No one knows how long this will last.
PSA.74.10	 How long, O God, will the enemy insult us?
PSA.74.10	Will the enemy despise you forever?
PSA.74.11	 Why do you hold back your hand, especially your right hand?
PSA.74.11	Take your hands out of your pockets.
PSA.74.11	Destroy your enemies! 
PSA.74.12	 And yet, from long ago God has been my king,
PSA.74.12	the one who has been victorious throughout the earth.
PSA.74.13	 You stirred up the sea with your own strength.
PSA.74.13	You smashed the heads of sea monsters in the water.
PSA.74.14	 You crushed the heads of Leviathan 
PSA.74.14	and gave them to the creatures of the desert for food.
PSA.74.15	 You opened the springs and brooks.
PSA.74.15	You dried up the ever-flowing rivers.
PSA.74.16	 The day and the night are yours.
PSA.74.16	You set the moon and the sun in their places.
PSA.74.17	 You determined all the boundaries of the earth.
PSA.74.17	You created summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	 Remember how the enemy insulted you, O L
PSA.74.18	Remember how an entire nation of godless fools despised your name.
PSA.74.19	 Do not hand over the soul of your dove to wild animals.
PSA.74.19	Do not forget the life of your oppressed people forever.
PSA.74.20	 Consider your promise 
PSA.74.20	because every dark corner of the land is filled with violence.
PSA.74.21	 Do not let oppressed people come back in disgrace.
PSA.74.21	Let weak and needy people praise your name.
PSA.74.22	 Arise, O God!
PSA.74.22	Fight for your own cause!
PSA.74.22	Remember how godless fools insult you all day long.
PSA.74.23	 Do not forget the shouting of your opponents.
PSA.74.23	Do not forget the uproar made by those who attack you.
PSA.75.1	 We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks.
PSA.75.1	You are present, and your miracles confirm that.
PSA.75.2	 When I choose the right time,
PSA.75.2	I will judge fairly.
PSA.75.3	 When the earth and everyone who lives on it begin to melt,
PSA.75.3	I will make its foundations as solid as rock. 
PSA.75.4	 I said to those who brag, “Don’t brag,”
PSA.75.4	and to wicked people,
PSA.75.4	“Don’t raise your weapons.
PSA.75.5	 Don’t raise your weapons so proudly
PSA.75.5	or speak so defiantly.”
PSA.75.6	 The ⌊authority⌋ to reward someone does not ⌊come⌋
PSA.75.6	from the east,
PSA.75.6	from the west,
PSA.75.6	or ⌊even⌋ from the wilderness.
PSA.75.7	 God alone is the judge.
PSA.75.7	He punishes one person and rewards another.
PSA.75.8	 A cup is in the L
PSA.75.8	(Its foaming wine is thoroughly mixed with spices.)
PSA.75.8	He will empty it,
PSA.75.8	⌊and⌋ all the wicked people on earth
PSA.75.8	will have to drink every last drop.
PSA.75.9	 But I will speak ⌊about your miracles⌋ forever.
PSA.75.9	I will make music to praise the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	 I will destroy all the weapons of wicked people,
PSA.75.10	but the weapons of righteous people will be raised proudly.
PSA.76.1	 God is known in Judah.
PSA.76.1	His name is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	 His tent is in Salem.
PSA.76.2	His home is in Zion.
PSA.76.3	 There he destroyed flaming arrows,
PSA.76.3	shields, swords, and weapons of war. 
PSA.76.4	 You are the radiant one.
PSA.76.4	You are more majestic than the ancient mountains.
PSA.76.5	 Brave people were robbed.
PSA.76.5	They died.
PSA.76.5	None of the warriors were able to lift a hand.
PSA.76.6	 At your stern warning, O God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	chariot riders and horses were put to sleep.
PSA.76.7	 You alone must be feared!
PSA.76.7	Who can stand in your presence when you become angry?
PSA.76.8	 From heaven you announced a verdict.
PSA.76.8	The earth was fearful and silent
PSA.76.9	 when you rose to judge, O God,
PSA.76.9	when you rose to save every oppressed person on earth. 
PSA.76.10	 Even angry mortals will praise you.
PSA.76.10	You will wear the remainder of ⌊their⌋ anger.
PSA.76.11	 Make vows to the L
PSA.76.11	Let everyone around him bring gifts to the one who must be feared.
PSA.76.12	 He cuts short the lives of influential people.
PSA.76.12	He terrifies the kings of the earth.
PSA.77.1	 Loudly, I cried to God.
PSA.77.1	Loudly, I cried to God
PSA.77.1	so that he would open his ears to ⌊hear⌋ me.
PSA.77.2	 On the day I was in trouble, I went to the Lord for help.
PSA.77.2	At night I stretched out my hands in prayer without growing tired.
PSA.77.2	Yet, my soul refused to be comforted.
PSA.77.3	 I sigh as I remember God.
PSA.77.3	I begin to lose hope as I think about him. 
PSA.77.4	 (You keep my eyelids open.)
PSA.77.4	I am so upset that I cannot speak.
PSA.77.5	 I have considered the days of old,
PSA.77.5	the years long ago.
PSA.77.6	 I remember my song in the night
PSA.77.6	and reflect ⌊on it⌋.
PSA.77.6	My spirit searches ⌊for an answer⌋:
PSA.77.7	 Will the L
PSA.77.7	Will he ever accept me?
PSA.77.8	 Has his mercy come to an end forever?
PSA.77.8	Has his promise been canceled throughout every generation?
PSA.77.9	 Has God forgotten to be merciful?
PSA.77.9	Has he locked up his compassion because of his anger? 
PSA.77.10	 Then I said, “It makes me feel sick
PSA.77.10	that the power of the Most High is no longer the same.” 
PSA.77.11	 I will remember the deeds of the L
PSA.77.11	I will remember your ancient miracles.
PSA.77.12	 I will reflect on all your actions
PSA.77.12	and think about what you have done.
PSA.77.13	 O God, your ways are holy!
PSA.77.13	What god is as great as our God?
PSA.77.14	 You are the God who performs miracles.
PSA.77.14	You have made your strength known among the nations.
PSA.77.15	 With your might you have defended your people,
PSA.77.15	the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. 
PSA.77.16	 The water saw you, O God.
PSA.77.16	The water saw you and shook.
PSA.77.16	Even the depths of the sea trembled.
PSA.77.17	 The clouds poured out water.
PSA.77.17	The sky thundered.
PSA.77.17	Even your arrows flashed in every direction.
PSA.77.18	 The sound of your thunder rumbled in the sky.
PSA.77.18	Streaks of lightning lit up the world.
PSA.77.18	The earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	 Your road went through the sea.
PSA.77.19	Your path went through raging water,
PSA.77.19	but your footprints could not be seen.
PSA.77.20	 Like a shepherd, you led your people.
PSA.77.20	You had Moses and Aaron take them by the hand.
PSA.78.1	 Open your ears to my teachings, my people.
PSA.78.1	Turn your ears to the words from my mouth.
PSA.78.2	 I will open my mouth to illustrate points.
PSA.78.2	I will explain what has been hidden long ago,
PSA.78.3	 things that we have heard and known about,
PSA.78.3	things that our parents have told us.
PSA.78.4	 We will not hide them from our children.
PSA.78.4	We will tell the next generation
PSA.78.4	about the L
PSA.78.4	and the miraculous things he has done.
PSA.78.5	 He established written instructions for Jacob’s people.
PSA.78.5	He gave his teachings to Israel.
PSA.78.5	He commanded our ancestors to make them known to their children
PSA.78.6	 so that the next generation would know them.
PSA.78.6	Children yet to be born ⌊would learn them⌋.
PSA.78.6	They will grow up and tell their children
PSA.78.7	 to trust God, to remember what he has done,
PSA.78.7	and to obey his commands.
PSA.78.8	 Then they will not be like their ancestors,
PSA.78.8	a stubborn and rebellious generation.
PSA.78.8	Their hearts were not loyal.
PSA.78.8	Their spirits were not faithful to God.
PSA.78.9	 The men of Ephraim, well-equipped with bows ⌊and arrows⌋,
PSA.78.9	turned ⌊and ran⌋ on the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	 They had not been faithful to God’s promise.
PSA.78.10	They refused to follow his teachings.
PSA.78.11	 They forgot what he had done—
PSA.78.11	the miracles that he had shown them.
PSA.78.12	 In front of their ancestors he performed miracles
PSA.78.12	in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.
PSA.78.13	 He divided the sea and led them through it.
PSA.78.13	He made the waters stand up like a wall.
PSA.78.14	 He guided them by a cloud during the day
PSA.78.14	and by a fiery light throughout the night.
PSA.78.15	 He split rocks in the desert.
PSA.78.15	He gave them plenty to drink, an ocean of water.
PSA.78.16	 He made streams come out of a rock.
PSA.78.16	He made the water flow like rivers.
PSA.78.17	 They continued to sin against him,
PSA.78.17	to rebel in the desert against the Most High.
PSA.78.18	 They deliberately tested God by demanding the food they craved.
PSA.78.19	 They spoke against God by saying,
PSA.78.19	“Can God prepare a banquet in the desert?
PSA.78.20	 True, he did strike a rock,
PSA.78.20	and water did gush out,
PSA.78.20	and the streams did overflow.
PSA.78.20	But can he also give us bread or provide us, his people, with meat?”
PSA.78.21	 When the L
PSA.78.21	His fire burned against Jacob
PSA.78.21	and his anger flared up at Israel
PSA.78.22	 because they did not believe God
PSA.78.22	or trust him to save them.
PSA.78.23	 In spite of that, he commanded the clouds above
PSA.78.23	and opened the doors of heaven.
PSA.78.24	 He rained manna down on them to eat
PSA.78.24	and gave them grain from heaven.
PSA.78.25	 Humans ate the bread of the mighty ones,
PSA.78.25	and God sent them plenty of food.
PSA.78.26	 He made the east wind blow in the heavens
PSA.78.26	and guided the south wind with his might.
PSA.78.27	 He rained meat down on them like dust,
PSA.78.27	birds like the sand on the seashore.
PSA.78.28	 He made the birds fall in the middle of his camp,
PSA.78.28	all around his dwelling place.
PSA.78.29	 They ate more than enough.
PSA.78.29	He gave them what they wanted,
PSA.78.30	 but they still wanted more.
PSA.78.30	While the food was still in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	 the anger of God flared up against them.
PSA.78.31	He killed their strongest men
PSA.78.31	and slaughtered the best young men in Israel.
PSA.78.32	 In spite of all this, they continued to sin,
PSA.78.32	and they no longer believed in his miracles.
PSA.78.33	 He brought their days to an end like a whisper in the wind.
PSA.78.33	He brought their years to an end in terror.
PSA.78.34	 When he killed ⌊some of⌋ them, ⌊the rest⌋ searched for him.
PSA.78.34	They turned from their sins and eagerly looked for God.
PSA.78.35	 They remembered that God was their rock,
PSA.78.35	that the Most High was their defender.
PSA.78.36	 They flattered him with their mouths
PSA.78.36	and lied to him with their tongues.
PSA.78.37	 Their hearts were not loyal to him.
PSA.78.37	They were not faithful to his promise.
PSA.78.38	 But he is compassionate.
PSA.78.38	He forgave their sin.
PSA.78.38	He did not destroy them.
PSA.78.38	He restrained his anger many times.
PSA.78.38	He did not display all of his fury.
PSA.78.39	 He remembered that they were only flesh and blood,
PSA.78.39	a breeze that blows and does not return.
PSA.78.40	 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness!
PSA.78.40	How often they caused him grief in the desert!
PSA.78.41	 Again and again they tested God,
PSA.78.41	and they pushed the Holy One of Israel to the limit.
PSA.78.42	 They did not remember his power—
PSA.78.42	the day he freed them from their oppressor,
PSA.78.43	 when he performed his miraculous signs in Egypt,
PSA.78.43	his wonders in the fields of Zoan.
PSA.78.44	 He turned their rivers into blood
PSA.78.44	so that they could not drink from their streams.
PSA.78.45	 He sent a swarm of flies that bit them
PSA.78.45	and frogs that ruined them.
PSA.78.46	 He gave their crops to grasshoppers
PSA.78.46	and their produce to locusts.
PSA.78.47	 He killed their vines with hail
PSA.78.47	and their fig trees with frost.
PSA.78.48	 He let the hail strike their cattle
PSA.78.48	and bolts of lightning strike their livestock.
PSA.78.49	 He sent his burning anger, rage, fury, and hostility against them.
PSA.78.49	He sent an army of destroying angels.
PSA.78.50	 He cleared a path for his anger.
PSA.78.50	He did not spare them.
PSA.78.50	He let the plague take their lives.
PSA.78.51	 He slaughtered every firstborn in Egypt,
PSA.78.51	the ones born in the tents of Ham when their fathers were young.
PSA.78.52	 But he led his own people out like sheep
PSA.78.52	and guided them like a flock through the wilderness.
PSA.78.53	 He led them safely.
PSA.78.53	They had no fear while the sea covered their enemies.
PSA.78.54	 He brought them into his holy land,
PSA.78.54	to this mountain that his power had won.
PSA.78.55	 He forced nations out of their way
PSA.78.55	and gave them the land of the nations as their inheritance.
PSA.78.55	He settled the tribes of Israel in their own tents.
PSA.78.56	 They tested God Most High and rebelled against him.
PSA.78.56	They did not obey his written instructions.
PSA.78.57	 They were disloyal and treacherous like their ancestors.
PSA.78.57	They were like arrows shot from a defective bow.
PSA.78.58	 They made him angry because of their illegal worship sites.
PSA.78.58	They made him furious because they worshiped idols.
PSA.78.59	 When God heard, he became furious.
PSA.78.59	He completely rejected Israel.
PSA.78.60	 He abandoned his dwelling place in Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	the tent where he had lived among humans.
PSA.78.61	 He allowed his power to be taken captive
PSA.78.61	and handed his glory over to an oppressor.
PSA.78.62	 He let swords kill his people.
PSA.78.62	He was furious with those who belonged to him.
PSA.78.63	 Fire consumed his best young men,
PSA.78.63	so his virgins heard no wedding songs.
PSA.78.64	 His priests were cut down with swords.
PSA.78.64	The widows ⌊of his priests⌋ could not even weep ⌊for them⌋.
PSA.78.65	 Then the Lord woke up like one who had been sleeping,
PSA.78.65	like a warrior sobering up from ⌊too much⌋ wine.
PSA.78.66	 He struck his enemies from behind
PSA.78.66	and disgraced them forever.
PSA.78.67	 He rejected the tent of Joseph.
PSA.78.67	He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
PSA.78.68	 but he chose the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	Mount Zion which he loved.
PSA.78.69	 He built his holy place to be like the high heavens,
PSA.78.69	like the earth which he made to last for a long time.
PSA.78.70	 He chose his servant David.
PSA.78.70	He took him from the sheep pens.
PSA.78.71	 He brought him from tending the ewes that had lambs
PSA.78.71	so that David could be the shepherd of the people of Jacob,
PSA.78.71	of Israel, the people who belonged to the L
PSA.78.72	 With unselfish devotion David became their shepherd.
PSA.78.72	With skill he guided them.
PSA.79.1	 O God, the nations have invaded the land that belongs to you.
PSA.79.1	They have dishonored your holy temple.
PSA.79.1	They have left Jerusalem in ruins.
PSA.79.2	 They have given the dead bodies of your servants
PSA.79.2	to the birds for food.
PSA.79.2	They have given the flesh of your godly ones
PSA.79.2	to the animals.
PSA.79.3	 They have shed the blood of your people around Jerusalem
PSA.79.3	as though it were water.
PSA.79.3	There is no one to bury your people.
PSA.79.4	 We have become a disgrace to our neighbors,
PSA.79.4	an object of ridicule and contempt to those around us.
PSA.79.5	 How long, O L
PSA.79.5	Will you remain angry forever?
PSA.79.5	Will your fury continue to burn like fire?
PSA.79.6	 Pour your fury on the nations that do not know you,
PSA.79.6	on the kingdoms that have not called you.
PSA.79.7	 They have devoured Jacob.
PSA.79.7	They have destroyed his home.
PSA.79.8	 Do not hold the crimes of our ancestors against us.
PSA.79.8	Reach out to us soon with your compassion,
PSA.79.8	because we are helpless.
PSA.79.9	 Help us, O God, our savior, for the glory of your name.
PSA.79.9	Rescue us, and forgive our sins for the honor of your name.
PSA.79.10	 Why should the nations ⌊be allowed to⌋ say,
PSA.79.10	“Where is their God?”
PSA.79.10	Let us watch as the nations learn
PSA.79.10	that there is punishment for shedding the blood of your servants.
PSA.79.11	 Let the groans of prisoners come into your presence.
PSA.79.11	With your powerful arm rescue those who are condemned to death.
PSA.79.12	 Pay each one of our neighbors back
PSA.79.12	with seven times the number of insults they used to insult you, O Lord.
PSA.79.13	 Then we, your people, the flock in your pasture,
PSA.79.13	will give thanks to you forever.
PSA.79.13	We will praise you throughout every generation.
PSA.80.1	 Open your ears, O Shepherd of Israel,
PSA.80.1	the one who leads ⌊the descendants of⌋ Joseph like sheep,
PSA.80.1	the one who is enthroned over the angels.
PSA.80.2	 Appear in front of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh.
PSA.80.2	Wake up your power, and come to save us.
PSA.80.3	 O God, restore us and smile on us
PSA.80.3	so that we may be saved.
PSA.80.4	 O L
PSA.80.4	against the prayer of your people?
PSA.80.5	 You made them eat tears as food.
PSA.80.5	You often made them drink ⌊their own⌋ tears.
PSA.80.6	 You made us a source of conflict to our neighbors,
PSA.80.6	and our enemies made fun of us.
PSA.80.7	 O God, commander of armies, restore us and smile on us
PSA.80.7	so that we may be saved.
PSA.80.8	 You brought a vine from Egypt.
PSA.80.8	You forced out the nations and planted it.
PSA.80.9	 You cleared the ground for it
PSA.80.9	so that it took root and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	 Its shade covered the mountains.
PSA.80.10	Its branches covered the mighty cedars.
PSA.80.11	 It reached out with its branches to the Mediterranean Sea.
PSA.80.11	Its shoots reached the Euphrates River.
PSA.80.12	 Why did you break down the stone fences around this vine?
PSA.80.12	All who pass by are picking its fruit.
PSA.80.13	 Wild boars from the forest graze on it.
PSA.80.13	Wild animals devour it.
PSA.80.14	 O God, commander of armies, come back!
PSA.80.14	Look from heaven and see!
PSA.80.14	Come to help this vine.
PSA.80.15	 Take care of what your right hand planted,
PSA.80.15	the son you strengthened for yourself.
PSA.80.16	 The vine has been cut down and burned.
PSA.80.16	Let them be destroyed by the threatening look on your face.
PSA.80.17	 Let your power rest on the man you have chosen,
PSA.80.17	the son of man you strengthened for yourself.
PSA.80.18	 Then we will never turn away from you.
PSA.80.18	Give us life again, and we will call on you.
PSA.80.19	 O L
PSA.80.19	so that we may be saved.
PSA.81.1	 Sing joyfully to God, our strength.
PSA.81.1	Shout happily to the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.2	 Begin a psalm, and strike a tambourine.
PSA.81.2	Play lyres and harps with their pleasant music.
PSA.81.3	 Blow the ram’s horn on the day of the new moon,
PSA.81.3	on the day of the full moon,
PSA.81.3	on our festival days.
PSA.81.4	 This is a law for Israel,
PSA.81.4	a legal decision from the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	 These are the instructions God set in place for Joseph
PSA.81.5	when Joseph rose to power over Egypt.
PSA.81.5	I heard a message I did not understand:
PSA.81.6	 “I removed the burden from his shoulder.
PSA.81.6	His hands were freed from the basket.
PSA.81.7	 When you were in trouble, you called out ⌊to me⌋, and I rescued you.
PSA.81.7	I was hidden in thunder, but I answered you.
PSA.81.7	I tested your ⌊loyalty⌋ at the oasis of Meribah. 
PSA.81.8	 Listen, my people, and I will warn you.
PSA.81.8	Israel, if you would only listen to me!
PSA.81.9	 Never keep any strange god among you.
PSA.81.9	Never worship a foreign god.
PSA.81.10	 I am the L
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
PSA.81.11	 “But my people did not listen to me.
PSA.81.11	Israel wanted nothing to do with me.
PSA.81.12	 So I let them go their own stubborn ways
PSA.81.12	and follow their own advice.
PSA.81.13	 If only my people would listen to me!
PSA.81.13	If only Israel would follow me!
PSA.81.14	 I would quickly defeat their enemies.
PSA.81.14	I would turn my power against their foes.
PSA.81.15	 Those who hate the L
PSA.81.15	and their time ⌊for punishment⌋ would last forever.
PSA.81.16	 But I would feed Israel with the finest wheat
PSA.81.16	and satisfy them with honey from a rock.”
PSA.82.1	 God takes his place in his own assembly.
PSA.82.1	He pronounces judgment among the gods:
PSA.82.2	 “How long are you going to judge unfairly?
PSA.82.2	How long are you going to side with wicked people?” 
PSA.82.3	 Defend weak people and orphans.
PSA.82.3	Protect the rights of the oppressed and the poor.
PSA.82.4	 Rescue weak and needy people.
PSA.82.4	Help them escape the power of wicked people.
PSA.82.5	 Wicked people do not know or understand anything.
PSA.82.5	As they walk around in the dark,
PSA.82.5	all the foundations of the earth shake.
PSA.82.6	 I said, “You are gods.
PSA.82.6	You are all sons of the Most High.
PSA.82.7	 You will certainly die like humans
PSA.82.7	and fall like any prince.”
PSA.82.8	 Arise, O God!
PSA.82.8	Judge the earth, because all the nations belong to you.
PSA.83.1	 O God, do not remain silent.
PSA.83.1	Do not turn a deaf ear to me.
PSA.83.1	Do not keep quiet, O God.
PSA.83.2	 Look, your enemies are in an uproar.
PSA.83.2	Those who hate you hold their heads high.
PSA.83.3	 They make plans in secret against your people
PSA.83.3	and plot together against those you treasure.
PSA.83.4	 They say, “Let’s wipe out their nation
PSA.83.4	so that the name of Israel will no longer be remembered.”
PSA.83.5	 They agree completely on their plan.
PSA.83.5	They form an alliance against you:
PSA.83.6	 the tents from Edom and Ishmael,
PSA.83.6	Moab and Hagar,
PSA.83.7	 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
PSA.83.7	Philistia, along with those who live in Tyre.
PSA.83.8	 Even Assyria has joined them.
PSA.83.8	They helped the descendants of Lot. 
PSA.83.9	 Do to them what you did to Midian,
PSA.83.9	to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.
PSA.83.10	 They were destroyed at Endor.
PSA.83.10	They became manure to fertilize the ground.
PSA.83.11	 Treat their influential people as you treated Oreb and Zeeb.
PSA.83.11	Treat all their leaders like Zebah and Zalmunna.
PSA.83.12	 They said, “Let’s take God’s pasturelands for ourselves.”
PSA.83.13	 O my God, blow them away like tumbleweeds,
PSA.83.13	like husks in the wind.
PSA.83.14	 Pursue them with your storms,
PSA.83.14	and terrify them with your windstorms
PSA.83.15	 the way fire burns a forest
PSA.83.15	and flames set mountains on fire.
PSA.83.16	 Let their faces blush with shame, O L
PSA.83.16	so that they must look to you for help.
PSA.83.17	 Let them be put to shame and terrified forever.
PSA.83.17	Let them die in disgrace
PSA.83.18	 so that they must acknowledge you.
PSA.83.18	Your name is the L
PSA.83.18	You alone are the Most High God of the whole earth.
PSA.84.1	 Your dwelling place is lovely, O L
PSA.84.2	 My soul longs and yearns
PSA.84.2	for the L
PSA.84.2	My whole body shouts for joy to the living God.
PSA.84.3	 Even sparrows find a home,
PSA.84.3	and swallows find a nest for themselves.
PSA.84.3	There they hatch their young
PSA.84.3	near your altars, O L
PSA.84.3	my king and my God.
PSA.84.4	 Blessed are those who live in your house.
PSA.84.4	They are always praising you. 
PSA.84.5	 Blessed are those who find strength in you.
PSA.84.5	Their hearts are on the road ⌊that leads to you⌋.
PSA.84.6	 As they pass through a valley where balsam trees grow,
PSA.84.6	they make it a place of springs.
PSA.84.6	The early rains cover it with blessings.
PSA.84.7	 Their strength grows as they go along
PSA.84.7	until each one of them appears
PSA.84.7	in front of God in Zion.
PSA.84.8	 O L
PSA.84.8	Open your ears, O God of Jacob. 
PSA.84.9	 Look at our shield, O God.
PSA.84.9	Look with favor on the face of your anointed one.
PSA.84.10	 One day in your courtyards is better than a thousand ⌊anywhere else⌋.
PSA.84.10	I would rather stand in the entrance to my God’s house
PSA.84.10	than live inside wicked people’s homes.
PSA.84.11	 The L
PSA.84.11	The L
PSA.84.11	He does not hold back any blessing
PSA.84.11	from those who live innocently.
PSA.84.12	 O L
PSA.85.1	 You favored your land, O L
PSA.85.1	You restored the fortunes of Jacob.
PSA.85.2	 You removed your people’s guilt.
PSA.85.2	You pardoned all their sins. 
PSA.85.3	 You laid aside all your fury.
PSA.85.3	You turned away from your burning anger.
PSA.85.4	 Restore us, O God, our savior.
PSA.85.4	Put an end to your anger against us.
PSA.85.5	 Will you be angry with us forever?
PSA.85.5	Will you ever let go of your anger in the generations to come?
PSA.85.6	 Won’t you restore our lives again
PSA.85.6	so that your people may find joy in you?
PSA.85.7	 Show us your mercy, O L
PSA.85.7	by giving us your salvation.
PSA.85.8	 I want to hear what God the L
PSA.85.8	because he promises peace to his people, to his godly ones.
PSA.85.8	But they must not go back to their stupidity.
PSA.85.9	 Indeed, his salvation is near those who fear him,
PSA.85.9	and ⌊his⌋ glory will remain in our land.
PSA.85.10	 Mercy and truth have met.
PSA.85.10	Righteousness and peace have kissed.
PSA.85.11	 Truth sprouts from the ground,
PSA.85.11	and righteousness looks down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	 The L
PSA.85.12	and our land will produce crops.
PSA.85.13	 Righteousness will go ahead of him
PSA.85.13	and make a path for his steps.
PSA.86.1	 Turn your ear ⌊toward me⌋, O L
PSA.86.1	Answer me, because I am oppressed and needy.
PSA.86.2	 Protect me, because I am faithful ⌊to you⌋.
PSA.86.2	Save your servant who trusts you. You are my God.
PSA.86.3	 Have pity on me, O Lord,
PSA.86.3	because I call out to you all day long.
PSA.86.4	 Give me joy, O Lord,
PSA.86.4	because I lift my soul to you.
PSA.86.5	 You, O Lord, are good and forgiving,
PSA.86.5	full of mercy toward everyone who calls out to you.
PSA.86.6	 Open your ears to my prayer, O L
PSA.86.6	Pay attention when I plead for mercy.
PSA.86.7	 When I am in trouble, I call out to you
PSA.86.7	because you answer me.
PSA.86.8	 No god is like you, O Lord.
PSA.86.8	No one can do what you do.
PSA.86.9	 All the nations that you have made
PSA.86.9	will bow in your presence, O Lord.
PSA.86.9	They will honor you.
PSA.86.10	 Indeed, you are great, a worker of miracles.
PSA.86.10	You alone are God.
PSA.86.11	 Teach me your way, O L
PSA.86.11	so that I may live in your truth.
PSA.86.11	Focus my heart on fearing you.
PSA.86.12	 I will give thanks to you with all my heart, O Lord my God.
PSA.86.12	I will honor you forever
PSA.86.13	 because your mercy toward me is great.
PSA.86.13	You have rescued me from the depths of hell.
PSA.86.14	 O God, arrogant people attack me,
PSA.86.14	and a mob of ruthless people seeks my life.
PSA.86.14	They think nothing of you.
PSA.86.15	 But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God.
PSA.86.15	You are patient, always faithful and ready to forgive.
PSA.86.16	 Turn toward me, and have pity on me.
PSA.86.16	Give me your strength because I am your servant.
PSA.86.16	Save me because I am the son of your female servant.
PSA.86.17	 Grant me some proof of your goodness
PSA.86.17	so that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame.
PSA.86.17	You, O L
PSA.87.1	 ⌊The city⌋ the L
PSA.87.2	 The L
PSA.87.2	more than any other place in Jacob.
PSA.87.3	 Glorious things are said about you, O city of God! 
PSA.87.4	 ⌊The L
PSA.87.4	as well as Philistia, Tyre, and Sudan
PSA.87.4	to the list of those who acknowledge me.
PSA.87.4	Each nation ⌊will claim that it⌋ was born there.”
PSA.87.5	 But it will be said of Zion,
PSA.87.5	“Every race is born in it.
PSA.87.5	The Most High will make it secure.”
PSA.87.6	 The L
PSA.87.6	“Every race ⌊claims that it⌋ was born there.” 
PSA.87.7	 Singers and dancers will sing,
PSA.87.7	“Zion is the source of all our blessings.”
PSA.88.1	 O L
PSA.88.1	I cry out to you during the day and at night.
PSA.88.2	 Let my prayer come into your presence.
PSA.88.2	Turn your ear to hear my cries.
PSA.88.3	 My soul is filled with troubles,
PSA.88.3	and my life comes closer to the grave.
PSA.88.4	 I am numbered with those who go into the pit.
PSA.88.4	I am like a man without any strength—
PSA.88.5	 abandoned with the dead,
PSA.88.5	like those who have been killed and lie in graves,
PSA.88.5	like those whom you no longer remember,
PSA.88.5	who are cut off from your power.
PSA.88.6	 You have put me in the bottom of the pit—in deep, dark places.
PSA.88.7	 Your rage lies heavily on me.
PSA.88.7	You make all your waves pound on me. 
PSA.88.8	 You have taken my friends far away from me.
PSA.88.8	You made me disgusting to them.
PSA.88.8	I’m shut in, and I can’t get out.
PSA.88.9	 My eyes grow weak because of my suffering.
PSA.88.9	All day long I call out to you, O L
PSA.88.9	I stretch out my hands to you ⌊in prayer⌋.
PSA.88.10	 Will you perform miracles for those who are dead?
PSA.88.10	Will the spirits of the dead rise and give thanks to you? 
PSA.88.11	 Will anyone tell about your mercy in Sheol
PSA.88.11	or about your faithfulness in Abaddon?
PSA.88.12	 Will anyone know about your miracles in that dark place
PSA.88.12	or about your righteousness in the place where forgotten people live?
PSA.88.13	 I cry out to you for help, O L
PSA.88.13	and in the morning my prayer will come into your presence.
PSA.88.14	 Why do you reject my soul, O L
PSA.88.14	Why do you hide your face from me?
PSA.88.15	 Ever since I was young, I have been suffering and near death.
PSA.88.15	I have endured your terrors, and now I am in despair.
PSA.88.16	 Your burning anger has swept over me.
PSA.88.16	Your terrors have destroyed me.
PSA.88.17	 They swirl around me all day long like water.
PSA.88.17	They surround me on all sides.
PSA.88.18	 You have taken my loved ones and friends far away from me.
PSA.88.18	Darkness is my only friend! 
PSA.89.1	 I will sing forever about the evidence of your mercy, O L
PSA.89.1	I will tell about your faithfulness to every generation.
PSA.89.2	 I said, “Your mercy will last forever.
PSA.89.2	Your faithfulness stands firm in the heavens.”
PSA.89.3	 ⌊You said,⌋ “I have made a promise 
PSA.89.3	I swore this oath to my servant David:
PSA.89.4	 ‘I will make your dynasty continue forever.
PSA.89.4	I built your throne to last throughout every generation.’” 
PSA.89.5	 O L
PSA.89.5	and your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones.
PSA.89.6	 Who in the skies can compare with the L
PSA.89.6	Who among the heavenly beings is like the L
PSA.89.7	 God is terrifying in the council of the holy ones.
PSA.89.7	He is greater and more awe-inspiring than those who surround him.
PSA.89.8	 O L
PSA.89.8	Mighty L
PSA.89.9	 You rule the raging sea.
PSA.89.9	When its waves rise, you quiet them.
PSA.89.10	 You crushed Rahab; 
PSA.89.10	With your strong arm you scattered your enemies.
PSA.89.11	 The heavens are yours.
PSA.89.11	The earth is also yours.
PSA.89.11	You made the world and everything in it.
PSA.89.12	 You created north and south.
PSA.89.12	Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon sing your name joyfully.
PSA.89.13	 Your arm is mighty.
PSA.89.13	Your hand is strong.
PSA.89.13	Your right hand is lifted high.
PSA.89.14	 Righteousness and justice are the foundations of your throne.
PSA.89.14	Mercy and truth stand in front of you.
PSA.89.15	 Blessed are the people who know how to praise you.
PSA.89.15	They walk in the light of your presence, O L
PSA.89.16	 They find joy in your name all day long.
PSA.89.16	They are joyful in your righteousness
PSA.89.17	 because you are the glory of their strength.
PSA.89.17	By your favor you give us victory.
PSA.89.18	 Our shield belongs to the L
PSA.89.18	Our king belongs to the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.89.19	 Once in a vision you said to your faithful ones:
PSA.89.19	“I set a boy above warriors.
PSA.89.19	I have raised up one chosen from the people.
PSA.89.20	 I found my servant David.
PSA.89.20	I anointed him with my holy oil.
PSA.89.21	 My hand is ready to help him.
PSA.89.21	My arm will also give him strength.
PSA.89.22	 No enemy will take him by surprise.
PSA.89.22	No wicked person will mistreat him.
PSA.89.23	 I will crush his enemies in front of him
PSA.89.23	and defeat those who hate him.
PSA.89.24	 My faithfulness and mercy will be with him,
PSA.89.24	and in my name he will be victorious.
PSA.89.25	 I will put his ⌊left⌋ hand on the sea
PSA.89.25	and his right hand on the rivers.
PSA.89.26	 He will call out to me,
PSA.89.26	‘You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.’
PSA.89.27	 Yes, I will make him the firstborn.
PSA.89.27	He will be the Most High to the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	 My mercy will stay with him forever.
PSA.89.28	My promise to him is unbreakable.
PSA.89.29	 I will make his dynasty endure forever
PSA.89.29	and his throne like the days of heaven.
PSA.89.30	 “If his descendants abandon my teachings
PSA.89.30	and do not live by my rules,
PSA.89.31	 if they violate my laws
PSA.89.31	and do not obey my commandments,
PSA.89.32	 then with a rod I will punish their rebellion
PSA.89.32	and their crimes with beatings.
PSA.89.33	 But I will not take my mercy away from him
PSA.89.33	or allow my truth to become a lie.
PSA.89.34	 I will not dishonor my promise
PSA.89.34	or alter my own agreement.
PSA.89.35	 On my holiness I have taken an oath once and for all:
PSA.89.35	I will not lie to David.
PSA.89.36	 His dynasty will last forever.
PSA.89.36	His throne will be in my presence like the sun.
PSA.89.37	 Like the moon his throne will stand firm forever.
PSA.89.37	It will be like a faithful witness in heaven.”
PSA.89.38	 But you have despised, rejected,
PSA.89.38	and become angry with your anointed one.
PSA.89.39	 You have refused to recognize the promise to your servant
PSA.89.39	and have thrown his crown into the dirt.
PSA.89.40	 You have broken through all his walls
PSA.89.40	and have laid his fortified cities in ruins.
PSA.89.41	 (Everyone who passed by robbed him.
PSA.89.41	He has become the object of his neighbors’ scorn.)
PSA.89.42	 You held the right hand of his enemies high
PSA.89.42	and made all of his adversaries rejoice.
PSA.89.43	 You even took his sword out of his hand
PSA.89.43	and failed to support him in battle.
PSA.89.44	 You put an end to his splendor
PSA.89.44	and hurled his throne to the ground.
PSA.89.45	 You cut short the days of his youth
PSA.89.45	and covered him with shame. 
PSA.89.46	 How long, O L
PSA.89.46	How long will your anger continue to burn like fire?
PSA.89.47	 Remember how short my life is!
PSA.89.47	Have you created Adam’s descendants for no reason?
PSA.89.48	 Can a mortal go on living and never see death?
PSA.89.48	Who can set himself free from the power of the grave? 
PSA.89.49	 Where is the evidence of your mercy, L
PSA.89.49	You swore an oath to David
PSA.89.49	on ⌊the basis of⌋ your faithfulness.
PSA.89.50	 Remember, O L
PSA.89.50	Remember how I have carried in my heart ⌊the insults⌋ from so many people.
PSA.89.51	 Your enemies insulted ⌊me⌋.
PSA.89.51	They insulted your Messiah 
PSA.89.52	 Thank the L
PSA.89.52	Amen and amen!
PSA.90.1	 O Lord, you have been our refuge throughout every generation.
PSA.90.2	 Before the mountains were born,
PSA.90.2	before you gave birth to the earth and the world, you were God.
PSA.90.2	You are God from everlasting to everlasting.
PSA.90.3	 You turn mortals back into dust
PSA.90.3	and say, “Return, descendants of Adam.”
PSA.90.4	 Indeed, in your sight a thousand years are like a single day,
PSA.90.4	like yesterday—already past—
PSA.90.4	like an hour in the night.
PSA.90.5	 You sweep mortals away.
PSA.90.5	They are a dream.
PSA.90.5	They sprout again in the morning like cut grass.
PSA.90.6	 In the morning they blossom and sprout.
PSA.90.6	In the evening they wither and dry up.
PSA.90.7	 Indeed, your anger consumes us.
PSA.90.7	Your rage terrifies us.
PSA.90.8	 You have set our sins in front of you.
PSA.90.8	You have put our secret sins in the light of your presence.
PSA.90.9	 Indeed, all our days slip away because of your fury.
PSA.90.9	We live out our years like one ⌊long⌋ sigh.
PSA.90.10	 Each of us lives for 70 years—
PSA.90.10	or even 80 if we are in good health.
PSA.90.10	But the best of them 
PSA.90.10	Indeed, they are soon gone, and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	 Who fully understands the power of your anger?
PSA.90.11	A person fears you more when he better understands your fury.
PSA.90.12	 Teach us to number each of our days
PSA.90.12	so that we may grow in wisdom.
PSA.90.13	 Return, L
PSA.90.13	Change your plans about ⌊us,⌋ your servants.
PSA.90.14	 Satisfy us every morning with your mercy
PSA.90.14	so that we may sing joyfully and rejoice all our days.
PSA.90.15	 Make us rejoice for as many days as you have made us suffer,
PSA.90.15	for as many years as we have experienced evil.
PSA.90.16	 Let ⌊us,⌋ your servants, see what you can do.
PSA.90.16	Let our children see your glorious power.
PSA.90.17	 Let the kindness of the Lord our God be with us.
PSA.90.17	Make us successful in everything we do.
PSA.90.17	Yes, make us successful in everything we do.
PSA.91.1	 Whoever lives under the shelter of the Most High
PSA.91.1	will remain in the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	 I will say to the L
PSA.91.2	“⌊You are⌋ my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust.”
PSA.91.3	 He is the one who will rescue you from hunters’ traps
PSA.91.3	and from deadly plagues.
PSA.91.4	 He will cover you with his feathers,
PSA.91.4	and under his wings you will find refuge.
PSA.91.4	His truth is your shield and armor.
PSA.91.5	 You do not need to fear
PSA.91.5	terrors of the night,
PSA.91.5	arrows that fly during the day,
PSA.91.6	 plagues that roam the dark,
PSA.91.6	epidemics that strike at noon.
PSA.91.7	 They will not come near you,
PSA.91.7	even though a thousand may fall dead beside you
PSA.91.7	or ten thousand at your right side.
PSA.91.8	 You only have to look with your eyes
PSA.91.8	to see the punishment of wicked people.
PSA.91.9	 You, O L
PSA.91.9	You have made the Most High your home.
PSA.91.10	 No harm will come to you.
PSA.91.10	No sickness will come near your house.
PSA.91.11	 He will put his angels in charge of you
PSA.91.11	to protect you in all your ways.
PSA.91.12	 They will carry you in their hands
PSA.91.12	so that you never hit your foot against a rock.
PSA.91.13	 You will step on lions and cobras.
PSA.91.13	You will trample young lions and snakes.
PSA.91.14	 Because you love me, I will rescue you.
PSA.91.14	I will protect you because you know my name.
PSA.91.15	 When you call to me, I will answer you.
PSA.91.15	I will be with you when you are in trouble.
PSA.91.15	I will save you and honor you.
PSA.91.16	 I will satisfy you with a long life.
PSA.91.16	I will show you how I will save you.
PSA.92.1	 It is good to give thanks to the L
PSA.92.1	to make music to praise your name, O Most High.
PSA.92.2	 It is good to announce your mercy in the morning
PSA.92.2	and your faithfulness in the evening
PSA.92.3	 on a ten-stringed instrument and a harp
PSA.92.3	and with a melody on a lyre.
PSA.92.4	 You made me find joy in what you have done, O L
PSA.92.4	I will sing joyfully about the works of your hands.
PSA.92.5	 How spectacular are your works, O L
PSA.92.5	How very deep are your thoughts!
PSA.92.6	 A stupid person cannot know
PSA.92.6	and a fool cannot understand
PSA.92.7	 that wicked people sprout like grass
PSA.92.7	and all troublemakers blossom ⌊like flowers⌋,
PSA.92.7	only to be destroyed forever.
PSA.92.8	 But you, O L
PSA.92.9	 Now look at your enemies, O L
PSA.92.9	Now look at your enemies.
PSA.92.9	They disappear, and all troublemakers are scattered.
PSA.92.10	 But you make me as strong as a wild bull,
PSA.92.10	and soothing lotion is poured on me.
PSA.92.11	 My eyes gloat over those who spy on me.
PSA.92.11	My ears hear ⌊the cries⌋ of evildoers attacking me.

PSA.106.7	 When our ancestors were in Egypt,
PSA.106.7	they gave no thought to your miracles.
PSA.106.7	They did not remember your numerous acts of mercy,
PSA.106.7	so they rebelled at the sea, the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	 He saved them because of his reputation
PSA.106.8	so that he could make his mighty power known.
PSA.106.9	 He angrily commanded the Red Sea, and it dried up.

PSA.106.21	the one who did spectacular things in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	 miracles in the land of Ham,

PSA.106.28	and they ate what was sacrificed to the dead.
PSA.106.29	 They infuriated God by what they did,
PSA.106.29	and a plague broke out among them.
PSA.106.30	 Then Phinehas stood between God and the people,
PSA.106.30	and the plague was stopped.
PSA.106.31	 Because of this, Phinehas was considered righteous forever,

PSA.106.35	They learned to do what other nations did,
PSA.106.36	 and they worshiped their idols,

PSA.106.37	 They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
PSA.106.38	 They shed innocent blood,

PSA.115.1	 Don’t give glory to us, O L
PSA.115.1	Don’t give glory to us.
PSA.115.1	Instead, give glory to your name
PSA.115.1	because of your mercy and faithfulness.
PSA.115.2	 Why should other nations say, “Where is their God?”
PSA.115.3	 Our God is in heaven.
PSA.115.3	He does whatever he wants.
PSA.115.4	 Their idols are made of silver and gold.
PSA.115.4	They were made by human hands.
PSA.115.5	 They have mouths, but they cannot speak.
PSA.115.5	They have eyes, but they cannot see.
PSA.115.6	 They have ears, but they cannot hear.
PSA.115.6	They have noses, but they cannot smell.
PSA.115.7	 They have hands, but they cannot feel.
PSA.115.7	They have feet, but they cannot walk.
PSA.115.7	They cannot ⌊even⌋ make a sound with their throats.
PSA.115.8	 Those who make idols end up like them.
PSA.115.8	So does everyone who trusts them.
PSA.115.9	 Israel, trust the L
PSA.115.9	He is your helper and your shield.
PSA.115.10	 Descendants of Aaron, trust the L
PSA.115.10	He is your helper and your shield.

PSA.115.14	 May the L
PSA.115.15	 You will be blessed by the L
PSA.115.16	 The highest heaven belongs to the L
PSA.115.16	but he has given the earth to the descendants of Adam.
PSA.115.17	 Those who are dead do not praise the L
PSA.115.17	nor do those who go into the silence ⌊of the grave⌋.
PSA.115.18	 But we will thank the L

PSA.116.9	 I will walk in the L
PSA.116.10	 I kept my faith even when I said,
PSA.116.10	“I am suffering terribly.”
PSA.116.11	 I also said when I was panic-stricken,
PSA.116.11	“Everyone is undependable.”
PSA.116.12	 How can I repay the L
PSA.116.12	for all the good that he has done for me?
PSA.116.13	 I will take the cup of salvation
PSA.116.13	and call on the name of the L
PSA.116.14	 I will keep my vows to the L
PSA.116.14	in the presence of all his people.
PSA.116.15	 Precious in the sight of the L
PSA.116.15	is the death of his faithful ones.
PSA.116.16	 O L
PSA.116.16	I am your servant,
PSA.116.16	the son of your female servant.
PSA.116.16	You have freed me from my chains.
PSA.116.17	 I will bring a song of thanksgiving to you as a sacrifice.
PSA.116.17	I will call on the name of the L
PSA.116.18	 I will keep my vows to the L
PSA.116.18	in the presence of all his people,

PSA.117.2	The L
PSA.117.2	Hallelujah!
PSA.118.1	 Give thanks to the L
PSA.118.1	because his mercy endures forever.
PSA.118.2	 Israel should say,
PSA.118.2	“His mercy endures forever.”
PSA.118.3	 The descendants of Aaron should say,
PSA.118.3	“His mercy endures forever.”
PSA.118.4	 Those who fear the L
PSA.118.4	“His mercy endures forever.”
PSA.118.5	 During times of trouble I called on the L
PSA.118.5	The L
PSA.118.6	 The L
PSA.118.6	I am not afraid.
PSA.118.6	What can mortals do to me?
PSA.118.7	 The L
PSA.118.7	I will see ⌊the defeat of⌋ those who hate me.
PSA.118.8	 It is better to depend on the L
PSA.118.8	than to trust mortals.
PSA.118.9	 It is better to depend on the L
PSA.118.9	than to trust influential people.

PSA.119.52	and I found comfort ⌊in them⌋.
PSA.119.53	 I am burning with anger because of wicked people,
PSA.119.53	who abandon your teachings.
PSA.119.54	 Your laws have become like psalms to me
PSA.119.54	in this place where I am only a foreigner.
PSA.119.55	 At night I remember your name, O L
PSA.119.55	and I follow your teachings.

PRO.2.7	He is a shield for those who walk in integrity
PRO.2.8	 in order to guard those on paths of justice
PRO.2.8	and to watch over the way of his godly ones.
PRO.2.9	 Then you will understand what is right and just and fair—
PRO.2.9	every good course ⌊in life⌋.
PRO.2.10	 Wisdom will come into your heart.
PRO.2.10	Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
PRO.2.11	 Foresight will protect you.
PRO.2.11	Understanding will guard you.
PRO.2.12	 ⌊Wisdom will⌋ save you
PRO.2.12	from the way of evil,
PRO.2.12	from the person who speaks devious things,
PRO.2.13	 from those who abandon the paths of righteousness
PRO.2.13	to walk the ways of darkness,
PRO.2.14	 from those who enjoy doing evil,
PRO.2.14	from those who find joy in the deviousness of evil.
PRO.2.15	 Their paths are crooked.
PRO.2.15	Their ways are devious.
PRO.2.16	 ⌊Wisdom will⌋ also save you
PRO.2.16	from an adulterous woman,
PRO.2.16	from a loose woman with her smooth talk,
PRO.2.17	 who leaves ⌊her husband,⌋ the closest friend of her youth,
PRO.2.17	and forgets her marriage vows to her God.
PRO.2.18	 Her house sinks down to death.
PRO.2.18	Her ways lead to the souls of the dead.
PRO.2.19	 None who have sex with her come back.
PRO.2.19	Nor do they ever reach the paths of life.
PRO.2.20	 So walk in the way of good people
PRO.2.20	and stay on the paths of righteous people.
PRO.2.21	 Decent people will live in the land.
PRO.2.21	People of integrity will remain in it.

PRO.3.1	 My son,
PRO.3.1	do not forget my teachings,
PRO.3.1	and keep my commands in mind,
PRO.3.2	 because they will bring you
PRO.3.2	long life, good years, and peace.
PRO.3.3	 Do not let mercy and truth leave you.
PRO.3.3	Fasten them around your neck.
PRO.3.3	Write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.3.4	 Then you will find favor and much success
PRO.3.4	in the sight of God and humanity.
PRO.3.5	 Trust the L
PRO.3.5	and do not rely on your own understanding.
PRO.3.6	 In all your ways acknowledge him,
PRO.3.6	and he will make your paths smooth.
PRO.3.7	 Do not consider yourself wise.

PRO.3.10	 Then your barns will be full,
PRO.3.10	and your vats will overflow with fresh wine.
PRO.3.11	 Do not reject the discipline of the L
PRO.3.11	and do not resent his warning,
PRO.3.12	 because the L
PRO.3.12	even as a father warns a son with whom he is pleased.
PRO.3.13	 Blessed is the one who finds wisdom
PRO.3.13	and the one who obtains understanding.
PRO.3.14	 The profit ⌊gained⌋ from ⌊wisdom⌋ is greater than

PRO.3.14	Its yield is better than fine gold.

PRO.3.15	and all your desires cannot equal it.
PRO.3.16	 Long life is in ⌊wisdom’s⌋ right hand.
PRO.3.16	In ⌊wisdom’s⌋ left hand are riches and honor.
PRO.3.17	 ⌊Wisdom’s⌋ ways are pleasant ways,

PRO.3.21	 My son,
PRO.3.21	do not lose sight of these things.
PRO.3.21	Use priceless wisdom and foresight.
PRO.3.22	 Then they will mean life for you,
PRO.3.22	and they will grace your neck.
PRO.3.23	 Then you will go safely on your way,

PRO.3.27	 Do not hold back anything good
PRO.3.27	from those who are entitled to it
PRO.3.27	when you have the power to do so.
PRO.3.28	 When you have the good thing with you, do not tell your neighbor,
PRO.3.28	“Go away!
PRO.3.28	Come back tomorrow.
PRO.3.28	I’ll give you something then.”
PRO.3.29	 Do not plan to do something wrong to your neighbor
PRO.3.29	while he is sitting there with you and suspecting nothing.
PRO.3.30	 Do not quarrel with a person for no reason
PRO.3.30	if he has not harmed you.
PRO.3.31	 Do not envy a violent person.
PRO.3.31	Do not choose any of his ways.
PRO.3.32	 The devious person is disgusting to the L

PRO.3.34	 When he mocks the mockers,

PRO.3.35	but fools will bear disgrace.
PRO.4.1	 Sons,
PRO.4.1	listen to ⌊your⌋ father’s discipline,
PRO.4.1	and pay attention in order to gain understanding.
PRO.4.2	 After all, I have taught you well.
PRO.4.2	Do not abandon my teachings.
PRO.4.3	 When I was a boy ⌊learning⌋ from my father,
PRO.4.3	when I was a tender and only child of my mother,
PRO.4.4	 they used to teach me and say to me,
PRO.4.4	“Cling to my words wholeheartedly.
PRO.4.4	Obey my commands so that you may live.
PRO.4.5	 Acquire wisdom.
PRO.4.5	Acquire understanding.
PRO.4.5	Do not forget.
PRO.4.5	Do not turn away from the words that I have spoken.
PRO.4.6	 Do not abandon wisdom, and it will watch over you.
PRO.4.6	Love wisdom, and it will protect you.
PRO.4.7	 The beginning of wisdom is to acquire wisdom.
PRO.4.7	Acquire understanding with all that you have.
PRO.4.8	 Cherish wisdom.
PRO.4.8	It will raise you up.
PRO.4.8	It will bring you honor when you embrace it.
PRO.4.9	 It will give you a graceful garland for your head.
PRO.4.9	It will hand you a beautiful crown.”
PRO.4.10	 My son,
PRO.4.10	listen and accept my words,
PRO.4.10	and they will multiply the years of your life.
PRO.4.11	 I have taught you the way of wisdom.
PRO.4.11	I have guided you along decent paths.
PRO.4.12	 When you walk, your stride will not be hampered.
PRO.4.12	Even if you run, you will not stumble.
PRO.4.13	 Cling to discipline.
PRO.4.13	Do not relax your grip on it.
PRO.4.13	Keep it because it is your life.
PRO.4.14	 Do not stray onto the path of wicked people.
PRO.4.14	Do not walk in the way of evil people.
PRO.4.15	 Avoid it.
PRO.4.15	Do not walk near it.
PRO.4.15	Turn away from it,
PRO.4.15	and keep on walking.
PRO.4.16	 Wicked people cannot sleep
PRO.4.16	unless they do wrong,
PRO.4.16	and they are robbed of their sleep
PRO.4.16	unless they make someone stumble.
PRO.4.17	 They eat food obtained through wrongdoing
PRO.4.17	and drink wine obtained through violence.
PRO.4.18	 But the path of righteous people is like the light of dawn
PRO.4.18	that becomes brighter and brighter until it reaches midday.
PRO.4.19	 The way of wicked people is like deep darkness.
PRO.4.19	They do not know what makes them stumble.
PRO.4.20	 My son,
PRO.4.20	pay attention to my words.
PRO.4.20	Open your ears to what I say.
PRO.4.21	 Do not lose sight of these things.
PRO.4.21	Keep them deep within your heart
PRO.4.22	 because they are life to those who find them
PRO.4.22	and they heal the whole body.
PRO.4.23	 Guard your heart more than anything else,
PRO.4.23	because the source of your life flows from it.
PRO.4.24	 Remove dishonesty from your mouth.
PRO.4.24	Put deceptive speech far away from your lips.
PRO.4.25	 Let your eyes look straight ahead
PRO.4.25	and your sight be focused in front of you.
PRO.4.26	 Carefully walk a straight path,
PRO.4.26	and all your ways will be secure.
PRO.4.27	 Do not lean to the right or to the left.
PRO.4.27	Walk away from evil.
PRO.5.1	 My son,
PRO.5.1	pay attention to my wisdom.
PRO.5.1	Open your ears to my understanding
PRO.5.2	 so that you may act with foresight
PRO.5.2	and speak with insight.
PRO.5.3	 The lips of an adulterous woman drip with honey.
PRO.5.3	Her kiss is smoother than oil,
PRO.5.4	 but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,
PRO.5.4	as sharp as a two-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	 Her feet descend to death.
PRO.5.5	Her steps lead straight to hell.
PRO.5.6	 She doesn’t even think about the path of life.
PRO.5.6	Her steps wander, and she doesn’t realize it.
PRO.5.7	 But now, sons,
PRO.5.7	listen to me,
PRO.5.7	and do not turn away from what I say to you.
PRO.5.8	 Stay far away from her.
PRO.5.8	Do not even go near her door.
PRO.5.9	 Either you will surrender your reputation to others
PRO.5.9	and ⌊the rest of⌋ your years to some cruel person,
PRO.5.10	 or strangers will benefit from your strength
PRO.5.10	and you will have to work hard in a pagan’s house.
PRO.5.11	 Then you will groan when your end comes,
PRO.5.11	when your body and flesh are consumed.
PRO.5.11	You will say,
PRO.5.12	 “Oh, how I hated discipline!
PRO.5.12	How my heart despised correction!
PRO.5.13	 I didn’t listen to what my teachers said to me,
PRO.5.13	nor did I keep my ear open to my instructors.
PRO.5.14	 I almost reached total ruin
PRO.5.14	in the assembly and in the congregation.”
PRO.5.15	 Drink water out of your own cistern
PRO.5.15	and running water from your own well.
PRO.5.16	 Why should water flow out of your spring?
PRO.5.16	Why should your streams flow into the streets?
PRO.5.17	 They should be yours alone,
PRO.5.17	so do not share them with strangers.
PRO.5.18	 Let your own fountain be blessed,
PRO.5.18	and enjoy the girl you married when you were young,
PRO.5.19	 a loving doe and a graceful deer.
PRO.5.19	Always let her breasts satisfy you.
PRO.5.19	Always be intoxicated with her love.
PRO.5.20	 Why should you, my son,
PRO.5.20	be intoxicated with an adulterous woman
PRO.5.20	and fondle a loose woman’s breast?
PRO.5.21	 Each person’s ways are clearly seen by the L
PRO.5.21	and he surveys all his actions.
PRO.5.22	 A wicked person will be trapped by his own wrongs,
PRO.5.22	and he will be caught in the ropes of his own sin.
PRO.5.23	 He will die for his lack of discipline
PRO.5.23	and stumble around because of his great stupidity.
PRO.6.1	 My son,
PRO.6.1	if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor
PRO.6.1	or pledge yourself for a stranger with a handshake,
PRO.6.2	 you are trapped by the words of your own mouth,
PRO.6.2	caught by your own promise.
PRO.6.3	 Do the following things, my son, so that you may free yourself,
PRO.6.3	because you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands:
PRO.6.3	Humble yourself,
PRO.6.3	and pester your neighbor.
PRO.6.4	 Don’t let your eyes rest
PRO.6.4	or your eyelids close.
PRO.6.5	 Free yourself like a gazelle from the hand of a hunter
PRO.6.5	and like a bird from the hand of a hunter.
PRO.6.6	 Consider the ant, you lazy bum.
PRO.6.6	Watch its ways, and become wise.
PRO.6.7	 Although it has no overseer, officer, or ruler,
PRO.6.8	 in summertime it stores its food supply.
PRO.6.8	At harvest time it gathers its food.
PRO.6.9	 How long will you lie there, you lazy bum?
PRO.6.9	When will you get up from your sleep?
PRO.6.10	 “Just a little sleep,
PRO.6.10	just a little slumber,
PRO.6.10	just a little nap.”
PRO.6.11	 Then your poverty will come ⌊to you⌋ like a drifter,
PRO.6.11	and your need will come ⌊to you⌋ like a bandit.
PRO.6.12	 A good-for-nothing scoundrel is a person who has a dishonest mouth.
PRO.6.13	 He winks his eye,
PRO.6.13	makes a signal with his foot,
PRO.6.13	⌊and⌋ points with his fingers.
PRO.6.14	 He devises evil all the time with a twisted mind.
PRO.6.14	He spreads conflict.
PRO.6.15	 That is why disaster will come on him suddenly.
PRO.6.15	In a moment he will be crushed beyond recovery.
PRO.6.16	 There are six things that the L
PRO.6.16	even seven that are disgusting to him:
PRO.6.17	 arrogant eyes,
PRO.6.17	a lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	hands that kill innocent people,
PRO.6.18	 a mind devising wicked plans,
PRO.6.18	feet that are quick to do wrong,
PRO.6.19	 a dishonest witness spitting out lies,
PRO.6.19	and a person who spreads conflict among relatives.
PRO.6.20	 My son,
PRO.6.20	obey the command of your father,
PRO.6.20	and do not disregard the teachings of your mother.
PRO.6.21	 Fasten them on your heart forever.
PRO.6.21	Hang them around your neck.
PRO.6.22	 When you walk around, they will lead you.
PRO.6.22	When you lie down, they will watch over you.
PRO.6.22	When you wake up, they will talk to you
PRO.6.23	 because the command is a lamp,
PRO.6.23	the teachings are a light,
PRO.6.23	and the warnings from discipline are the path of life
PRO.6.24	 to keep you from an evil woman
PRO.6.24	and from the smooth talk of a loose woman.
PRO.6.25	 Do not desire her beauty in your heart.
PRO.6.25	Do not let her catch you with her eyes.
PRO.6.26	 A prostitute’s price is ⌊only⌋ a loaf of bread,
PRO.6.26	but a married woman hunts for ⌊your⌋ life itself.
PRO.6.27	 Can a man carry fire in his lap
PRO.6.27	without burning his clothes?
PRO.6.28	 Can anyone walk on red-hot coals
PRO.6.28	without burning his feet?
PRO.6.29	 So it is with a man who has sex with his neighbor’s wife.
PRO.6.29	None who touch her will escape punishment.
PRO.6.30	 People do not despise a thief who is hungry
PRO.6.30	when he steals to satisfy his appetite,
PRO.6.31	 but when he is caught,
PRO.6.31	he has to repay it seven times.
PRO.6.31	He must give up all the possessions in his house.
PRO.6.32	 Whoever commits adultery with a woman has no sense.
PRO.6.32	Whoever does this destroys himself.
PRO.6.33	 An adulterous man will find disease 
PRO.6.33	and his disgrace will not be blotted out,
PRO.6.34	 because jealousy arouses a husband’s fury.
PRO.6.34	The husband will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
PRO.6.35	 No amount of money will change his mind.
PRO.6.35	The largest bribe will not satisfy him.
PRO.7.1	 My son,
PRO.7.1	pay attention to my words.
PRO.7.1	Treasure my commands that are within you.
PRO.7.2	 Obey my commands so that you may live.
PRO.7.2	Follow my teachings just as you protect the pupil of your eye.
PRO.7.3	 Tie them on your fingers.
PRO.7.3	Write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.7.4	 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister.”
PRO.7.4	Give the name “my relative” to understanding
PRO.7.5	 in order to guard yourself from an adulterous woman,
PRO.7.5	from a loose woman with her smooth talk.
PRO.7.6	 From a window in my house I looked through my screen.
PRO.7.7	 I was looking at gullible people
PRO.7.7	when I saw a young man without much sense among youths.
PRO.7.8	 He was crossing a street near her corner
PRO.7.8	and walking toward her house
PRO.7.9	 in the twilight,
PRO.7.9	in the evening,
PRO.7.9	in the dark hours of the night.
PRO.7.10	 A woman with an ulterior motive meets him.
PRO.7.10	She is dressed as a prostitute.
PRO.7.11	 She is loud and rebellious.
PRO.7.11	Her feet will not stay at home.
PRO.7.12	 One moment she is out on the street,
PRO.7.12	the next she is at the curb,
PRO.7.12	on the prowl at every corner.
PRO.7.13	 She grabs him and kisses him and brazenly says to him,
PRO.7.14	 “I have some sacrificial meat.
PRO.7.14	Today I kept my vows.
PRO.7.15	 That’s why I came to meet you.
PRO.7.15	Eagerly, I looked for you,
PRO.7.15	and I’ve found you.
PRO.7.16	 I’ve made my bed,
PRO.7.16	with colored sheets of Egyptian linen.
PRO.7.17	 I’ve sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	 Come, let’s drink our fill of love until morning.
PRO.7.18	Let’s enjoy making love,
PRO.7.19	 because my husband’s not home.
PRO.7.19	He has gone on a long trip.
PRO.7.20	 He took lots of money with him.
PRO.7.20	He won’t be home for a couple of weeks.”
PRO.7.21	 With all her seductive charms, she persuades him.
PRO.7.21	With her smooth lips, she makes him give in.
PRO.7.22	 He immediately follows her
PRO.7.22	like a steer on its way to be slaughtered,
PRO.7.22	like a ram hobbling into captivity 
PRO.7.23	 until an arrow pierces his heart,
PRO.7.23	like a bird darting into a trap.
PRO.7.23	He does not realize that it will cost him his life.
PRO.7.24	 Now, sons,
PRO.7.24	listen to me.
PRO.7.24	Pay attention to the words from my mouth.
PRO.7.25	 Do not let your heart be turned to her ways.
PRO.7.25	Do not wander onto her paths,
PRO.7.26	 because she has brought down many victims,
PRO.7.26	and she has killed all too many.
PRO.7.27	 Her home is the way to hell
PRO.7.27	and leads to the darkest vaults of death.
PRO.8.1	 Does not wisdom call out?
PRO.8.1	Does not understanding raise its voice?
PRO.8.2	 ⌊Wisdom⌋ takes its stand on high ground,
PRO.8.2	by the wayside where the roads meet,
PRO.8.3	 near the gates to the city.
PRO.8.3	At the entrance ⌊wisdom⌋ sings its song,
PRO.8.4	 “I am calling to all of you,
PRO.8.4	and my appeal is to all people.
PRO.8.5	 You gullible people, learn how to be sensible.
PRO.8.5	You fools, get a heart that has understanding.
PRO.8.6	 Listen! I am speaking about noble things,
PRO.8.6	and my lips will say what is right.
PRO.8.7	 My mouth expresses the truth,
PRO.8.7	and wickedness is disgusting to my lips.
PRO.8.8	 Everything I say is fair,
PRO.8.8	and there is nothing twisted or crooked in it.
PRO.8.9	 All of it is clear to a person who has understanding
PRO.8.9	and right to those who have acquired knowledge.
PRO.8.10	 Take my discipline, not silver,
PRO.8.10	and my knowledge rather than fine gold,
PRO.8.11	 because wisdom is better than jewels.
PRO.8.11	Nothing you desire can equal it.
PRO.8.12	 “I, Wisdom, live with insight,
PRO.8.12	and I acquire knowledge and foresight.
PRO.8.13	 To fear the L
PRO.8.13	I hate pride, arrogance, evil behavior, and twisted speech.
PRO.8.14	 Advice and priceless wisdom are mine.
PRO.8.14	I, Understanding, have strength.
PRO.8.15	 Through me kings reign,
PRO.8.15	and rulers decree fair laws.
PRO.8.16	 Through me princes rule,
PRO.8.16	so do nobles and all fair judges.
PRO.8.17	 I love those who love me.
PRO.8.17	Those eagerly looking for me will find me.
PRO.8.18	 I have riches and honor,
PRO.8.18	lasting wealth and righteousness.
PRO.8.19	 What I produce is better than gold, pure gold.
PRO.8.19	What I yield is better than fine silver.
PRO.8.20	 I walk in the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,
PRO.8.21	 to give an inheritance to those who love me
PRO.8.21	and to fill their treasuries.
PRO.8.22	 “The L
PRO.8.22	when his way began,
PRO.8.22	before any of his works.
PRO.8.23	 I was appointed from everlasting
PRO.8.23	from the first,
PRO.8.23	before the earth began.
PRO.8.24	 I was born
PRO.8.24	before there were oceans,
PRO.8.24	before there were springs filled with water.
PRO.8.25	 I was born
PRO.8.25	before the mountains were settled in their places
PRO.8.25	and before the hills,
PRO.8.26	 when he had not yet made land or fields
PRO.8.26	or the first dust of the world.
PRO.8.27	 “When he set up the heavens, I was there.
PRO.8.27	When he traced the horizon on the surface of the ocean,
PRO.8.28	 when he established the skies above,
PRO.8.28	when he determined the currents in the ocean,
PRO.8.29	 when he set a limit for the sea
PRO.8.29	so the waters would not overstep his command,
PRO.8.29	when he traced the foundations of the earth,
PRO.8.30	 I was beside him as a master craftsman.
PRO.8.30	I made him happy day after day,
PRO.8.30	I rejoiced in front of him all the time,
PRO.8.31	 found joy in his inhabited world,
PRO.8.31	and delighted in the human race.
PRO.8.32	 “Now, sons, listen to me.
PRO.8.32	Blessed are those who follow my ways.
PRO.8.33	 Listen to discipline, and become wise.
PRO.8.33	Do not leave my ways.
PRO.8.34	 Blessed is the person who listens to me,
PRO.8.34	watches at my door day after day,
PRO.8.34	and waits by my doorposts.
PRO.8.35	 Whoever finds me finds life
PRO.8.35	and obtains favor from the L
PRO.8.36	 Whoever sins against me harms himself.
PRO.8.36	All those who hate me love death.”
PRO.9.1	 Wisdom has built her house.
PRO.9.1	She has carved out her seven pillars.
PRO.9.2	 She has prepared her meat.
PRO.9.2	She has mixed her wine.
PRO.9.2	She has set her table.
PRO.9.3	 She has sent out her servant girls.
PRO.9.3	She calls from the highest places in the city,
PRO.9.4	 “Whoever is gullible turn in here!”
PRO.9.4	She says to a person without sense,
PRO.9.5	 “Come, eat my bread,
PRO.9.5	and drink the wine I have mixed.
PRO.9.6	 Stop being gullible and live.
PRO.9.6	Start traveling the road to understanding.”
PRO.9.7	 Whoever corrects a mocker receives abuse.
PRO.9.7	Whoever warns a wicked person gets hurt.
PRO.9.8	 Do not warn a mocker, or he will hate you.
PRO.9.8	Warn a wise person, and he will love you.
PRO.9.9	 Give ⌊advice⌋ to a wise person,

PRO.9.9	Teach a righteous person,

PRO.9.10	 The fear of the L
PRO.9.10	The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
PRO.9.11	 You will live longer because of me,
PRO.9.11	and years will be added to your life.
PRO.9.12	 If you are wise, your wisdom will help you.
PRO.9.12	If you mock, you alone will be held responsible.
PRO.9.13	 The woman Stupidity is loud, gullible, and ignorant.
PRO.9.14	 She sits at the doorway of her house.
PRO.9.14	She is enthroned on the high ground of the city
PRO.9.15	 and calls to those who pass by,
PRO.9.15	those minding their own business,
PRO.9.16	 “Whoever is gullible turn in here!”
PRO.9.16	She says to a person without sense,
PRO.9.17	 “Stolen waters are sweet,

PRO.24.3	 With wisdom a house is built.
PRO.24.3	With understanding it is established.
PRO.24.4	 With knowledge its rooms are filled
PRO.24.4	with every kind of riches, both precious and pleasant.
PRO.24.5	 A strong man knows how to use his strength,
PRO.24.5	but a person with knowledge is even more powerful.
PRO.24.6	 After all, with the right strategy you can wage war,
PRO.24.6	and with many advisers there is victory.
PRO.24.7	 Matters of wisdom are beyond the grasp of a stubborn fool.
PRO.24.7	At the city gate he does not open his mouth.
PRO.24.8	 Whoever plans to do evil will be known as a schemer.
PRO.24.9	 Foolish scheming is sinful,
PRO.24.9	and a mocker is disgusting to everyone.
PRO.24.10	 If you faint in a crisis, you are weak.
PRO.24.11	 Rescue captives condemned to death,
PRO.24.11	and spare those staggering toward their slaughter.
PRO.24.12	 When you say, “We didn’t know this,”
PRO.24.12	won’t the one who weighs hearts take note of it?
PRO.24.12	Won’t the one who guards your soul know it?
PRO.24.12	Won’t he pay back people for what they do?
PRO.24.13	 Eat honey, my son, because it is good.
PRO.24.13	Honey that flows from the honeycomb tastes sweet.
PRO.24.14	 The knowledge of wisdom is like that for your soul.
PRO.24.14	If you find it, then there is a future,
PRO.24.14	and your hope will never be cut off.
PRO.24.15	 You wicked one,
PRO.24.15	do not lie in ambush at the home of a righteous person.
PRO.24.15	Do not rob his house.
PRO.24.16	 A righteous person may fall seven times, but he gets up again.
PRO.24.16	However, in a disaster wicked people fall.
PRO.24.17	 Do not be happy when your enemy falls,
PRO.24.17	and do not feel glad when he stumbles.
PRO.24.18	 The L
PRO.24.18	and he will turn his anger away from that person.
PRO.24.19	 Do not get overly upset with evildoers.
PRO.24.19	Do not envy wicked people,
PRO.24.20	 because an evil person has no future,
PRO.24.20	and the lamps of wicked people will be snuffed out.
PRO.24.21	 Fear the L
PRO.24.21	Fear the king as well.
PRO.24.21	Do not associate with those who always insist upon change,
PRO.24.22	 because disaster will come to them suddenly.
PRO.24.22	Who knows what misery both may bring?
PRO.24.23	 These also are the sayings of wise people:
PRO.24.23	Showing partiality as a judge is not good.
PRO.24.24	 Whoever says to a guilty person, “You are innocent,”
PRO.24.24	will be cursed by people and condemned by nations.
PRO.24.25	 But people will be pleased with those who convict a guilty person,
PRO.24.25	and a great blessing will come to them.
PRO.24.26	 Giving a straight answer is ⌊like⌋ a kiss on the lips.
PRO.24.27	 Prepare your work outside,
PRO.24.27	and get things ready for yourself in the field.
PRO.24.27	Afterwards, build your house.
PRO.24.28	 Do not testify against your neighbor without a reason,
PRO.24.28	and do not deceive with your lips.
PRO.24.29	 Do not say,
PRO.24.29	“I’ll treat him as he treated me.
PRO.24.29	I’ll pay him back for what he has done to me.”
PRO.24.30	 I passed by a lazy person’s field,
PRO.24.30	the vineyard belonging to a person without sense.
PRO.24.31	 I saw that it was all overgrown with thistles.
PRO.24.31	The ground was covered with weeds,
PRO.24.31	and its stone fence was torn down.
PRO.24.32	 When I observed ⌊this⌋, I took it to heart.
PRO.24.32	I saw it and learned my lesson.
PRO.24.33	 “Just a little sleep,
PRO.24.33	just a little slumber,
PRO.24.33	just a little nap.”
PRO.24.34	 Then your poverty will come like a drifter,
PRO.24.34	and your need will come like a bandit.
PRO.25.1	 These also are Solomon’s proverbs that were copied
PRO.25.1	by the men of King Hezekiah of Judah.
PRO.25.2	 It is the glory of God to hide things
PRO.25.2	but the glory of kings to investigate them.
PRO.25.3	 ⌊Like⌋ the high heavens and the deep earth,
PRO.25.3	so the mind of kings is unsearchable.
PRO.25.4	 Take the impurities out of silver,
PRO.25.4	and a vessel is ready for the silversmith to mold.
PRO.25.5	 Take a wicked person away from the presence of a king,
PRO.25.5	and justice will make his throne secure.
PRO.25.6	 Do not brag about yourself in front of a king
PRO.25.6	or stand in the spot that belongs to notable people,
PRO.25.7	 because it is better to be told, “Come up here,”
PRO.25.7	than to be put down in front of a prince
PRO.25.7	whom your eyes have seen.
PRO.25.8	 Do not be in a hurry to go to court.
PRO.25.8	What will you do in the end if your neighbor disgraces you?
PRO.25.9	 Present your argument to your neighbor,
PRO.25.9	but do not reveal another person’s secret.
PRO.25.10	 Otherwise, when he hears about it, he will humiliate you,
PRO.25.10	and his evil report about you will never disappear.
PRO.25.11	 ⌊Like⌋ golden apples in silver settings,
PRO.25.11	⌊so⌋ is a word spoken at the right time.
PRO.25.12	 ⌊Like⌋ a gold ring and a fine gold ornament,
PRO.25.12	⌊so⌋ is constructive criticism to the ear of one who listens.
PRO.25.13	 Like the coolness of snow on a harvest day,
PRO.25.13	⌊so⌋ is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him:
PRO.25.13	He refreshes his masters.
PRO.25.14	 ⌊Like⌋ a dense fog or a dust storm,
PRO.25.14	⌊so⌋ is a person who brags about a gift that he does not give.
PRO.25.15	 With patience you can persuade a ruler,
PRO.25.15	and a soft tongue can break bones.
PRO.25.16	 When you find honey, eat only as much as you need.
PRO.25.16	Otherwise, you will have too much and vomit.
PRO.25.17	 Do not set foot in your neighbor’s house too often.
PRO.25.17	Otherwise, he will see too much of you and hate you.
PRO.25.18	 ⌊Like⌋ a club and a sword and a sharp arrow,
PRO.25.18	⌊so⌋ is a person who gives false testimony against his neighbor.
PRO.25.19	 ⌊Like⌋ a broken tooth and a lame foot,
PRO.25.19	⌊so⌋ is confidence in an unfaithful person in a ⌊time of⌋ crisis.
PRO.25.20	 ⌊Like⌋ taking off a coat on a cold day
PRO.25.20	or pouring vinegar on baking soda,
PRO.25.20	so is singing songs to one who has an evil heart.
PRO.25.21	 If your enemy is hungry, give him some food to eat,
PRO.25.21	and if he is thirsty, give him some water to drink.
PRO.25.22	 ⌊In this way⌋ you will make him feel guilty and ashamed,
PRO.25.22	and the L
PRO.25.23	 ⌊As⌋ the north wind brings rain,
PRO.25.23	so a whispering tongue brings angry looks.
PRO.25.24	 Better to live on a corner of a roof
PRO.25.24	than to share a home with a quarreling woman.
PRO.25.25	 ⌊Like⌋ cold water to a thirsty soul,
PRO.25.25	so is good news from far away.
PRO.25.26	 ⌊Like⌋ a muddied spring and a polluted well,
PRO.25.26	⌊so⌋ is a righteous person who gives in to a wicked person.
PRO.25.27	 Eating too much honey is not good,
PRO.25.27	and searching for honor is not honorable.
PRO.25.28	 ⌊Like⌋ a city broken into ⌊and⌋ left without a wall,
PRO.25.28	⌊so⌋ is a person who lacks self-control.
PRO.26.1	 Like snow in summertime and rain at harvest time,
PRO.26.1	so honor is not right for a fool.
PRO.26.2	 Like a fluttering sparrow,
PRO.26.2	like a darting swallow,
PRO.26.2	so a hastily spoken curse does not come to rest.
PRO.26.3	 A whip is for the horse,
PRO.26.3	a bridle is for the donkey,
PRO.26.3	and a rod is for the backs of fools.
PRO.26.4	 Do not answer a fool with his own stupidity,
PRO.26.4	or you will be like him.
PRO.26.5	 Answer a fool with his own stupidity,
PRO.26.5	or he will think he is wise.
PRO.26.6	 Whoever uses a fool to send a message
PRO.26.6	cuts off his own feet and brings violence upon himself.
PRO.26.7	 ⌊Like⌋ a lame person’s limp legs,
PRO.26.7	so is a proverb in the mouths of fools.
PRO.26.8	 Like tying a stone to a sling,
PRO.26.8	so is giving honor to a fool.
PRO.26.9	 ⌊Like⌋ a thorn stuck in a drunk’s hand,
PRO.26.9	so is a proverb in the mouths of fools.
PRO.26.10	 ⌊Like⌋ many people who destroy everything,
PRO.26.10	so is one who hires fools or drifters.
PRO.26.11	 As a dog goes back to its vomit,
PRO.26.11	⌊so⌋ a fool repeats his stupidity.
PRO.26.12	 Have you met a person who thinks he is wise?
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.26.13	 A lazy person says,
PRO.26.13	“There’s a ferocious lion out on the road!
PRO.26.13	There’s a lion loose in the streets!”
PRO.26.14	 ⌊As⌋ a door turns on its hinges,
PRO.26.14	so the lazy person turns on his bed.
PRO.26.15	 A lazy person puts his fork in his food.
PRO.26.15	He wears himself out as he brings it back to his mouth.
PRO.26.16	 A lazy person thinks he is wiser than seven people who give a sensible answer.
PRO.26.17	 ⌊Like⌋ grabbing a dog by the ears,
PRO.26.17	⌊so⌋ is a bystander who gets involved in someone else’s quarrel.
PRO.26.18	 Like a madman who shoots flaming arrows, arrows, and death,
PRO.26.19	 so is the person who tricks his neighbor and says, “I was only joking!”
PRO.26.20	 Without wood a fire goes out,
PRO.26.20	and without gossip a quarrel dies down.
PRO.26.21	 ⌊As⌋ charcoal fuels burning coals and wood fuels fire,
PRO.26.21	so a quarrelsome person fuels a dispute.
PRO.26.22	 The words of a gossip are swallowed greedily,
PRO.26.22	and they go down into a person’s innermost being.
PRO.26.23	 ⌊Like⌋ a clay pot covered with cheap silver,
PRO.26.23	⌊so⌋ is smooth talk that covers up an evil heart.
PRO.26.24	 Whoever is filled with hate disguises it with his speech,
PRO.26.24	but inside he holds on to deceit.
PRO.26.25	 When he talks charmingly, do not trust him
PRO.26.25	because of the seven disgusting things in his heart.
PRO.26.26	 His hatred is deceitfully hidden,
PRO.26.26	but his wickedness will be revealed to the community.
PRO.26.27	 Whoever digs a pit will fall into it.
PRO.26.27	Whoever rolls a stone will have it roll back on him.
PRO.26.28	 A lying tongue hates its victims,
PRO.26.28	and a flattering mouth causes ruin.
PRO.27.1	 Do not brag about tomorrow,
PRO.27.1	because you do not know what another day may bring.
PRO.27.2	 Praise should come from another person and not from your own mouth,
PRO.27.2	from a stranger and not from your own lips.
PRO.27.3	 A stone is heavy, and sand weighs a lot,
PRO.27.3	but annoyance caused by a stubborn fool is heavier than both.
PRO.27.4	 Anger is cruel, and fury is overwhelming,
PRO.27.4	but who can survive jealousy?
PRO.27.5	 Open criticism is better than unexpressed love.
PRO.27.6	 Wounds made by a friend are intended to help,
PRO.27.6	but an enemy’s kisses are too much to bear.
PRO.27.7	 One who is full despises honey,
PRO.27.7	but to one who is hungry,
PRO.27.7	even bitter food tastes sweet.
PRO.27.8	 Like a bird wandering from its nest,
PRO.27.8	so is a husband wandering from his home.
PRO.27.9	 Perfume and incense make the heart glad,
PRO.27.9	but the sweetness of a friend is a fragrant forest.
PRO.27.10	 Do not abandon your friend or your father’s friend.
PRO.27.10	Do not go to a relative’s home when you are in trouble.
PRO.27.10	A neighbor living nearby is better than a relative far away.
PRO.27.11	 Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad
PRO.27.11	so that I can answer anyone who criticizes me.
PRO.27.12	 Sensible people foresee trouble and hide.
PRO.27.12	Gullible people go ahead ⌊and⌋ suffer.
PRO.27.13	 Hold on to the garment of one who guarantees a stranger’s loan,
PRO.27.13	and hold responsible the person
PRO.27.13	who makes a loan in behalf of a foreigner.
PRO.27.14	 Whoever blesses his friend early in the morning with a loud voice—
PRO.27.14	his blessing is considered a curse.
PRO.27.15	 Constantly dripping water on a rainy day is like a quarreling woman.
PRO.27.16	 Whoever can control her can control the wind.
PRO.27.16	He can even pick up olive oil with his right hand.
PRO.27.17	 ⌊As⌋ iron sharpens iron,
PRO.27.17	so one person sharpens the wits of another.
PRO.27.18	 Whoever takes care of a fig tree can eat its fruit,
PRO.27.18	and whoever protects his master is honored.
PRO.27.19	 As a face is reflected in water,
PRO.27.19	so a person is reflected by his heart.
PRO.27.20	 Hell and decay are never satisfied,
PRO.27.20	and a person’s eyes are never satisfied.
PRO.27.21	 The crucible is for refining silver and the smelter for gold,
PRO.27.21	but a person ⌊is tested⌋ by the praise given to him.
PRO.27.22	 If you crush a stubborn fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,
PRO.27.22	⌊even then⌋ his stupidity will not leave him.
PRO.27.23	 Be fully aware of the condition of your flock,
PRO.27.23	and pay close attention to your herds.
PRO.27.24	 Wealth is not forever.
PRO.27.24	Nor does a crown last from one generation to the next.
PRO.27.25	 ⌊When⌋ grass is cut short, the tender growth appears,
PRO.27.25	and vegetables are gathered on the hills.
PRO.27.26	 Lambs ⌊will provide⌋ you with clothing,
PRO.27.26	and the money from the male goats will buy a field.
PRO.27.27	 There will be enough goat milk to feed you,
PRO.27.27	to feed your family,
PRO.27.27	and to keep your servant girls alive.
PRO.28.1	 A wicked person flees when no one is chasing him,
PRO.28.1	but righteous people are as bold as lions.
PRO.28.2	 When a country is in revolt, it has many rulers,
PRO.28.2	but only with a person who has understanding and knowledge
PRO.28.2	will it last a long time.
PRO.28.3	 A poor person who oppresses poorer people
PRO.28.3	is like a driving rain that leaves no food.
PRO.28.4	 Those who abandon ⌊God’s⌋ teachings praise wicked people,
PRO.28.4	but those who follow ⌊God’s⌋ teachings oppose wicked people.
PRO.28.5	 Evil people do not understand justice,
PRO.28.5	but those who seek the L
PRO.28.6	 Better to be a poor person who has integrity
PRO.28.6	than to be rich and double-dealing.
PRO.28.7	 Whoever follows ⌊God’s⌋ teachings is a wise son.
PRO.28.7	Whoever associates with gluttons disgraces his father.
PRO.28.8	 Whoever becomes wealthy through ⌊unfair⌋ loans and interest
PRO.28.8	collects them for the one who is kind to the poor.
PRO.28.9	 Surely the prayer of someone who refuses
PRO.28.9	to listen to ⌊God’s⌋ teachings is disgusting.
PRO.28.10	 Whoever leads decent people into evil will fall into his own pit,
PRO.28.10	but innocent people will inherit good things.
PRO.28.11	 A rich person is wise in his own eyes,
PRO.28.11	but a poor person with understanding sees right through him.
PRO.28.12	 When righteous people triumph, there is great glory,
PRO.28.12	but when wicked people rise, people hide themselves.
PRO.28.13	 Whoever covers over his sins does not prosper.
PRO.28.13	Whoever confesses and abandons them receives compassion.
PRO.28.14	 Blessed is the one who is always fearful ⌊of sin⌋,
PRO.28.14	but whoever is hard-hearted falls into disaster.
PRO.28.15	 ⌊Like⌋ a roaring lion and a charging bear,
PRO.28.15	⌊so⌋ a wicked ruler is a threat to poor people.
PRO.28.16	 A leader without understanding taxes ⌊his people⌋ heavily,
PRO.28.16	but those who hate unjust gain will live longer.
PRO.28.17	 A person burdened with the guilt of murder
PRO.28.17	will be a fugitive down to his grave.
PRO.28.17	No one will help him.
PRO.28.18	 Whoever lives honestly will be safe.
PRO.28.18	Whoever lives dishonestly will fall all at once.
PRO.28.19	 Whoever works his land will have plenty to eat.
PRO.28.19	Whoever chases unrealistic dreams will have plenty of nothing.
PRO.28.20	 A trustworthy person has many blessings,
PRO.28.20	but anyone in a hurry to get rich will not escape punishment.
PRO.28.21	 Showing partiality is not good,
PRO.28.21	because some people will turn on you even for a piece of bread.
PRO.28.22	 A stingy person is in a hurry to get rich,
PRO.28.22	not realizing that poverty is about to overtake him.
PRO.28.23	 Whoever criticizes people will be more highly regarded in the future
PRO.28.23	than the one who flatters with his tongue.
PRO.28.24	 The one who robs his father or his mother
PRO.28.24	and says, “It isn’t wrong!” is a companion to a vandal.
PRO.28.25	 A greedy person stirs up a fight,
PRO.28.25	but whoever trusts the L
PRO.28.26	 Whoever trusts his own heart is a fool.
PRO.28.26	Whoever walks in wisdom will survive.
PRO.28.27	 Whoever gives to the poor lacks nothing.
PRO.28.27	Whoever ignores the poor receives many curses.
PRO.28.28	 When wicked people rise, people hide.
PRO.28.28	When they die, righteous people increase.
PRO.29.1	 A person who will not bend after many warnings
PRO.29.1	will suddenly be broken beyond repair.
PRO.29.2	 When righteous people increase, the people ⌊of God⌋ rejoice,
PRO.29.2	but when a wicked person rules, everybody groans.
PRO.29.3	 A person who loves wisdom makes his father happy,
PRO.29.3	but one who pays prostitutes wastes his wealth.
PRO.29.4	 By means of justice, a king builds up a country,
PRO.29.4	but a person who confiscates religious contributions tears it down.
PRO.29.5	 A person who flatters his neighbor
PRO.29.5	is spreading a net for him to step into.
PRO.29.6	 To an evil person sin is bait in a trap,
PRO.29.6	but a righteous person runs away from it 
PRO.29.7	 A righteous person knows the just cause of the poor.
PRO.29.7	A wicked person does not understand this.
PRO.29.8	 Mockers create an uproar in a city,
PRO.29.8	but wise people turn away anger.
PRO.29.9	 When a wise person goes to court with a stubborn fool,
PRO.29.9	he may rant and rave,
PRO.29.9	but there is no peace and quiet.
PRO.29.10	 Bloodthirsty people hate an innocent person,
PRO.29.10	but decent people seek ⌊to protect⌋ his life.
PRO.29.11	 A fool expresses all his emotions,
PRO.29.11	but a wise person controls them.
PRO.29.12	 If a ruler pays attention to lies,
PRO.29.12	all his servants become wicked.
PRO.29.13	 A poor person and an oppressor have this in common:
PRO.29.13	The L
PRO.29.14	 When a king judges the poor with honesty,
PRO.29.14	his throne will always be secure.
PRO.29.15	 A spanking and a warning produce wisdom,
PRO.29.15	but an undisciplined child disgraces his mother.
PRO.29.16	 When wicked people increase, crime increases,
PRO.29.16	but righteous people will witness their downfall.
PRO.29.17	 Correct your son, and he will give you peace of mind.
PRO.29.17	He will bring delight to your soul.
PRO.29.18	 Without prophetic vision people run wild,
PRO.29.18	but blessed are those who follow ⌊God’s⌋ teachings.
PRO.29.19	 A slave cannot be disciplined with words.
PRO.29.19	He will not respond, though he may understand.
PRO.29.20	 Have you met a person who is quick to answer?
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.29.21	 Pamper a slave from childhood,
PRO.29.21	and later he will be ungrateful.
PRO.29.22	 An angry person stirs up a fight,
PRO.29.22	and a hothead does much wrong.
PRO.29.23	 A person’s pride will humiliate him,
PRO.29.23	but a humble spirit gains honor.
PRO.29.24	 Whoever is a thief’s partner hates his own life.
PRO.29.24	He will not testify under oath.
PRO.29.25	 A person’s fear sets a trap ⌊for him⌋,
PRO.29.25	but one who trusts the L
PRO.29.26	 Many seek an audience with a ruler,
PRO.29.26	but justice for humanity comes from the L
PRO.29.27	 An unjust person is disgusting to righteous people.
PRO.29.27	A decent person is disgusting to wicked people.
PRO.30.1	 The words of Agur, son of Jakeh. Agur’s prophetic revelation.
PRO.30.1	This man’s declaration:
PRO.30.1	“I’m weary, O God.
PRO.30.1	I’m weary and worn out, O God.
PRO.30.2	 I’m more ⌊like⌋ a dumb animal than a human being.
PRO.30.2	I don’t ⌊even⌋ have human understanding.
PRO.30.3	 I haven’t learned wisdom.
PRO.30.3	I don’t have knowledge of the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	 “Who has gone up to heaven and come down?
PRO.30.4	Who has gathered the wind in the palm of his hand?
PRO.30.4	Who has wrapped water in a garment?
PRO.30.4	Who has set up the earth from one end to the other?
PRO.30.4	What is his name or the name of his son?
PRO.30.4	Certainly, you must know!
PRO.30.5	 “Every word of God has proven to be true.
PRO.30.5	He is a shield to those who come to him for protection.
PRO.30.6	 Do not add to his words,
PRO.30.6	or he will reprimand you, and you will be found to be a liar.
PRO.30.7	 “I’ve asked you for two things.
PRO.30.7	Don’t keep them from me before I die:
PRO.30.8	 Keep vanity and lies far away from me.
PRO.30.8	Don’t give me either poverty or riches.
PRO.30.8	Feed me ⌊only⌋ the food I need,
PRO.30.9	 or I may feel satisfied and deny you
PRO.30.9	and say, ‘Who is the L
PRO.30.9	or I may become poor and steal
PRO.30.9	and give the name of my God a bad reputation.
PRO.30.10	 “Do not slander a slave to his master.
PRO.30.10	The slave will curse you,
PRO.30.10	and you will be found guilty.”
PRO.30.11	 A certain kind of person curses his father
PRO.30.11	and does not bless his mother.
PRO.30.12	 A certain kind of person thinks he is pure
PRO.30.12	but is not washed from his own feces.
PRO.30.13	 A certain kind of person looks around arrogantly
PRO.30.13	and is conceited.
PRO.30.14	 A certain kind of person,
PRO.30.14	whose teeth are like swords
PRO.30.14	and whose jaws are ⌊like⌋ knives,
PRO.30.14	devours oppressed people from the earth
PRO.30.14	and people from among humanity.
PRO.30.15	 The bloodsucking leech has two daughters—“Give!” and “Give!”
PRO.30.15	Three things are never satisfied.
PRO.30.15	Four never say, “Enough!”:
PRO.30.16	 the grave,
PRO.30.16	a barren womb,
PRO.30.16	a land that never gets enough water,
PRO.30.16	a fire that does not say, “Enough!”
PRO.30.17	 The eye that makes fun of a father and hates to obey a mother
PRO.30.17	will be plucked out by ravens in the valley and eaten by young vultures.
PRO.30.18	 Three things are too amazing to me,
PRO.30.18	even four that I cannot understand:
PRO.30.19	 an eagle making its way through the sky,
PRO.30.19	a snake making its way over a rock,
PRO.30.19	a ship making its way through high seas,
PRO.30.19	a man making his way with a virgin.
PRO.30.20	 This is the way of a woman who commits adultery:
PRO.30.20	She eats, wipes her mouth,
PRO.30.20	and says, “I haven’t done anything wrong!”
PRO.30.21	 Three things cause the earth to tremble,
PRO.30.21	even four it cannot bear up under:
PRO.30.22	 a slave when he becomes king,
PRO.30.22	a godless fool when he is filled with food,
PRO.30.23	 a woman who is unloved when she gets married,
PRO.30.23	a maid when she replaces her mistress.
PRO.30.24	 Four things on earth are small,
PRO.30.24	yet they are very wise:
PRO.30.25	 Ants are not a strong species,
PRO.30.25	yet they store their food in summer.
PRO.30.26	 Rock badgers are not a mighty species,
PRO.30.26	yet they make their home in the rocks.
PRO.30.27	 Locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	yet all of them divide into swarms by instinct.
PRO.30.28	 A lizard you can hold in your hands,
PRO.30.28	yet it can even be found in royal palaces.
PRO.30.29	 There are three things that walk with dignity,
PRO.30.29	even four that march with dignity:
PRO.30.30	 a lion, mightiest among animals, which turns away from nothing,
PRO.30.31	 a strutting rooster,
PRO.30.31	a male goat,
PRO.30.31	a king at the head of his army.
PRO.30.32	 If you are such a godless fool as to honor yourself,
PRO.30.32	or if you scheme,
PRO.30.32	you had better put your hand over your mouth.
PRO.30.33	 As churning milk produces butter
PRO.30.33	and punching a nose produces blood,
PRO.30.33	so stirring up anger 
PRO.31.1	 The sayings of King Lemuel, a prophetic revelation, used by his mother to discipline him.
PRO.31.2	 “What, my son?
PRO.31.2	What, son to whom I gave birth?
PRO.31.2	What, son of my prayers?
PRO.31.3	 Don’t give your strength to women
PRO.31.3	or your power to those who ruin kings.
PRO.31.4	 “It is not for kings, Lemuel.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings to drink wine or for rulers to crave liquor.
PRO.31.5	 Otherwise, they drink and forget what they have decreed
PRO.31.5	and change the standard of justice for all oppressed people.
PRO.31.6	 Give liquor to a person who is dying
PRO.31.6	and wine to one who feels resentful.
PRO.31.7	 Such a person drinks
PRO.31.7	and forgets his poverty
PRO.31.7	and does not remember his trouble anymore.
PRO.31.8	 “Speak out for the one who cannot speak,
PRO.31.8	for the rights of those who are doomed.
PRO.31.9	 Speak out,
PRO.31.9	judge fairly,
PRO.31.9	and defend the rights of oppressed and needy people.”
PRO.31.10	 “Who can find a wife with a strong character?
PRO.31.10	She is worth far more than jewels.
PRO.31.11	 Her husband trusts her with ⌊all⌋ his heart,
PRO.31.11	and he does not lack anything good.
PRO.31.12	 She helps him and never harms him all the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	 “She seeks out wool and linen ⌊with care⌋
PRO.31.13	and works with willing hands.
PRO.31.14	 She is like merchant ships.
PRO.31.14	She brings her food from far away.
PRO.31.15	 She wakes up while it is still dark
PRO.31.15	and gives food to her family
PRO.31.15	and portions of food to her female slaves.
PRO.31.16	 “She picks out a field and buys it.
PRO.31.16	She plants a vineyard from the profits she has earned.
PRO.31.17	 She puts on strength like a belt
PRO.31.17	and goes to work with energy.
PRO.31.18	 She sees that she is making a good profit.
PRO.31.18	Her lamp burns late at night.
PRO.31.19	 “She puts her hands on the distaff,
PRO.31.19	and her fingers hold a spindle.
PRO.31.20	 She opens her hands to oppressed people
PRO.31.20	and stretches them out to needy people.
PRO.31.21	 She does not fear for her family when it snows
PRO.31.21	because her whole family
PRO.31.21	has a double layer of clothing.
PRO.31.22	 She makes quilts for herself.
PRO.31.22	Her clothes are ⌊made of⌋ linen and purple cloth.
PRO.31.23	 “Her husband is known at the city gates
PRO.31.23	when he sits with the leaders of the land.
PRO.31.24	 “She makes linen garments and sells them
PRO.31.24	and delivers belts to the merchants.
PRO.31.25	 She dresses with strength and nobility,
PRO.31.25	and she smiles at the future.
PRO.31.26	 “She speaks with wisdom,
PRO.31.26	and on her tongue there is tender instruction.
PRO.31.27	 She keeps a close eye on the conduct of her family,
PRO.31.27	and she does not eat the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	 Her children and her husband
PRO.31.28	stand up and bless her.
PRO.31.28	In addition, he sings her praises, by saying,
PRO.31.29	 ‘Many women have done noble work,
PRO.31.29	but you have surpassed them all!’
PRO.31.30	 “Charm is deceptive, and beauty evaporates,
PRO.31.30	⌊but⌋ a woman who has the fear of the L
PRO.31.31	 Reward her for what she has done,
PRO.31.31	and let her achievements praise her at the city gates.”
ECC.1.1	 The words of the spokesman, the son of David and the king in Jerusalem.
ECC.1.2	 “Absolutely pointless!” says the spokesman. “Absolutely pointless! Everything is pointless.”
ECC.1.3	 What do people gain from all their hard work under the sun?
ECC.1.4	 Generations come, and generations go,
ECC.1.4	but the earth lasts forever.
ECC.1.5	 The sun rises, and the sun sets,
ECC.1.5	and then it rushes back to the place where it will rise ⌊again⌋.
ECC.1.6	 The wind blows toward the south and shifts toward the north.
ECC.1.6	Round and round it blows. It blows in a full circle.
ECC.1.7	 All streams flow into the sea, but the sea is never full.
ECC.1.7	The water goes back to the place where the streams began
ECC.1.7	in order to ⌊start⌋ flowing again.
ECC.1.8	 All of these sayings are worn-out phrases. They are more than anyone can express, comprehend, or understand.
ECC.1.9	 Whatever has happened before will happen ⌊again⌋. Whatever has been done before will be done ⌊again⌋. There is nothing new under the sun. 
ECC.1.10	 Can you say that anything is new? It has already been here long before us. 
ECC.1.11	 Nothing from the past is remembered. Even in the future, nothing will be remembered by those who come after us.
ECC.1.12	 I, the spokesman, have been king of Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	 With all my heart I used wisdom to study and explore everything done under heaven.
ECC.1.13	Mortals are weighed down with a terrible burden that God has placed on them. 
ECC.1.14	 I have seen everything that is done under the sun. Look at it! It’s all pointless. ⌊It’s like⌋ trying to catch the wind.
ECC.1.15	 No one can straighten what is bent.
ECC.1.15	No one can count what is not there.
ECC.1.16	 I thought to myself, “I have grown wiser than anyone who ⌊has ruled⌋ Jerusalem before me. I’ve had a lot of experience with wisdom and knowledge.” 
ECC.1.17	 I’ve used my mind to understand wisdom and knowledge as well as madness and stupidity. ⌊Now⌋ I know that this is ⌊like⌋ trying to catch the wind.
ECC.1.18	 With a lot of wisdom ⌊comes⌋ a lot of heartache.
ECC.1.18	The greater ⌊your⌋ knowledge, the greater ⌊your⌋ pain.
ECC.2.1	 I thought to myself, “Now I want to experiment with pleasure and enjoy myself.” But even this was pointless.
ECC.2.2	 I thought, “Laughter doesn’t make any sense. What does pleasure accomplish?”
ECC.2.3	 I explored ways to make myself feel better by drinking wine. I also explored ways to do ⌊some⌋ foolish things. During all that time, wisdom continued to control my mind. I was able to determine whether this was good for mortals to do during their brief lives under heaven.
ECC.2.4	 I accomplished some great things:
ECC.2.4	I built houses for myself.
ECC.2.4	I planted vineyards for myself.
ECC.2.5	 I made gardens and parks for myself.
ECC.2.5	I planted every kind of fruit tree in them.
ECC.2.6	 I made pools to water the forest of growing trees.
ECC.2.7	 I bought male and female slaves.
ECC.2.7	In addition, slaves were born in my household.
ECC.2.7	I owned more herds and flocks
ECC.2.7	than anyone in Jerusalem before me.
ECC.2.8	 I also gathered silver and gold for myself.
ECC.2.8	I gathered the treasures of kings and provinces.
ECC.2.8	I provided myself with male and female singers
ECC.2.8	and the pleasures men have with one concubine 
ECC.2.9	 So I grew richer than anyone in Jerusalem before me. Yet, my wisdom remained with me. 
ECC.2.10	 If something appealed to me, I did it. I allowed myself to have any pleasure I wanted, since I found pleasure in my work. This was my reward for all my hard work.
ECC.2.11	 But when I turned to look at all that I had accomplished and all the hard work I had put into it, I saw that it was all pointless. ⌊It was like⌋ trying to catch the wind. I gained nothing ⌊from any of my accomplishments⌋ under the sun.
ECC.2.12	 Then I turned ⌊my attention⌋ to experience wisdom, madness, and foolishness. For instance, what can the man who replaces the king do? Only what has already been done. 
ECC.2.13	 But I saw that wisdom has an advantage over foolishness as light has an advantage over darkness. 
ECC.2.14	 A wise person uses the eyes in his head, but a fool walks in the dark. But I have also come to realize that the same destiny waits for both of them.
ECC.2.15	 I thought to myself, “⌊If⌋ the destiny that waits for the fool waits for me as well, then what is the advantage in being wise?” So I thought that even this is pointless.
ECC.2.16	 Neither the wise person nor the fool will be remembered for long, since both will be forgotten in the days to come. Both the wise person and the fool will die. 
ECC.2.17	 So I came to hate life because everything done under the sun seemed wrong to me. Everything was pointless. ⌊It was like⌋ trying to catch the wind.
ECC.2.18	 I came to hate everything for which I had worked so hard under the sun, because I will have to leave it to the person who replaces me. 
ECC.2.19	 Who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? He will still have control over everything under the sun for which I worked so hard and used my wisdom. Even this is pointless.
ECC.2.20	 Then I fell into despair over everything for which I had worked so hard under the sun. 
ECC.2.21	 Here is someone who had worked hard with wisdom, knowledge, and skill. Yet, he must turn over his estate to someone else, who didn’t work for it. Even this is pointless and a terrible tragedy.
ECC.2.22	 What do people get from all of their hard work and struggles under the sun? 
ECC.2.23	 Their entire life is filled with pain, and their work is unbearable. Even at night their minds don’t rest. Even this is pointless.
ECC.2.24	 There is nothing better for people to do than to eat, drink, and find satisfaction in their work. I saw that even this comes from the hand of God. 
ECC.2.25	 Who can eat or enjoy themselves without God? 
ECC.2.26	 God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to anyone who pleases him. But to the person who continues to sin, he gives the job of gathering and collecting ⌊wealth⌋. The sinner must turn his wealth over to the person who pleases God. Even this is pointless. ⌊It’s like⌋ trying to catch the wind.
ECC.3.1	 Everything has its own time, and there is a specific time for every activity under heaven:
ECC.3.2	 a time to be born and
ECC.3.2	a time to die,
ECC.3.2	a time to plant and
ECC.3.2	a time to pull out what was planted,
ECC.3.3	 a time to kill and
ECC.3.3	a time to heal,
ECC.3.3	a time to tear down and
ECC.3.3	a time to build up,
ECC.3.4	 a time to cry and
ECC.3.4	a time to laugh,
ECC.3.4	a time to mourn and
ECC.3.4	a time to dance,
ECC.3.5	 a time to scatter stones and
ECC.3.5	a time to gather them,
ECC.3.5	a time to hug and
ECC.3.5	a time to stop hugging,
ECC.3.6	 a time to start looking and
ECC.3.6	a time to stop looking,
ECC.3.6	a time to keep and
ECC.3.6	a time to throw away,
ECC.3.7	 a time to tear apart and
ECC.3.7	a time to sew together,
ECC.3.7	a time to keep quiet and
ECC.3.7	a time to speak out,
ECC.3.8	 a time to love and
ECC.3.8	a time to hate,
ECC.3.8	a time for war and
ECC.3.8	a time for peace.
ECC.3.9	 What do working people gain from their hard labor? 
ECC.3.10	 I have seen mortals weighed down with a burden that God has placed on them. 
ECC.3.11	 It is beautiful how God has done everything at the right time. He has put a sense of eternity in people’s minds. Yet, mortals still can’t grasp what God is doing from the beginning to the end ⌊of time⌋.
ECC.3.12	 I realize that there’s nothing better for them to do than to be cheerful and enjoy what is good in their lives. 
ECC.3.13	 It is a gift from God to be able to eat and drink and experience the good that comes from every kind of hard work.
ECC.3.14	 I realize that whatever God does will last forever. Nothing can be added to it, and nothing can be taken away from it. God does this so that people will fear him.
ECC.3.15	 Whatever has happened ⌊in the past⌋ is present now. Whatever is going to happen ⌊in the future⌋ has already happened ⌊in the past⌋. God will call the past to account.
ECC.3.16	 I saw something else under the sun:
ECC.3.16	There is wickedness where justice should be found.
ECC.3.16	There is wickedness where righteousness should be found.
ECC.3.17	 I thought to myself, “God will judge righteous people as well as wicked people, because there is a specific time for every activity and every work that is done.” 
ECC.3.18	 I thought to myself, “God is going to test humans in order to show them that they are ⌊like⌋ animals.” 
ECC.3.19	 Humans and animals have the same destiny. One dies just like the other. All of them have the same breath ⌊of life⌋. Humans have no advantage over animals. All ⌊of life⌋ is pointless. 
ECC.3.20	 All ⌊life⌋ goes to the same place. All ⌊life⌋ comes from the ground, and all of it goes back to the ground. 
ECC.3.21	 Who knows whether a human spirit goes upward or whether an animal spirit goes downward to the earth?
ECC.3.22	 I saw that there’s nothing better for people to do than to enjoy their work because that is their lot ⌊in life⌋. Who will allow them to see what will happen after them?
ECC.4.1	 Next, I turned to look at all the acts of oppression that make people suffer under the sun. Look at the tears of those who suffer! No one can comfort them. Their oppressors have ⌊all⌋ the power. No one can comfort those who suffer. 
ECC.4.2	 I congratulate the dead, who have already died, rather than the living, who still have to carry on. 
ECC.4.3	 But the person who hasn’t been born yet is better off than both of them. He hasn’t seen the evil that is done under the sun.
ECC.4.4	 Then I saw that all hard work and skillful effort come from rivalry. Even this is pointless. ⌊It’s like⌋ trying to catch the wind. 
ECC.4.5	 A fool folds his hands and wastes away. 
ECC.4.6	 One handful of peace and quiet is better than two handfuls of hard work and of trying to catch the wind.
ECC.4.7	 Next, I turned to look at something pointless under the sun: 
ECC.4.8	 There are people who are all alone. They have no children or other family members. So there is no end to all the hard work they have to do. Their eyes are never satisfied with riches. But ⌊they never ask themselves⌋ why they are working so hard and depriving themselves of good things. Even this is pointless and a terrible tragedy.
ECC.4.9	 Two people are better than one because ⌊together⌋ they have a good reward for their hard work. 
ECC.4.10	 If one falls, the other can help his friend get up. But how tragic it is for the one who is ⌊all⌋ alone when he falls. There is no one to help him get up. 
ECC.4.11	 Again, if two people lie down together, they can keep warm, but how can one person keep warm? 
ECC.4.12	 Though one person may be overpowered by another, two people can resist one opponent. A triple-braided rope is not easily broken.
ECC.4.13	 A young man who is poor and wise is better than an old, foolish king who won’t take advice any longer.
ECC.4.14	 A young man came out of prison to rule as king, even though he had been born in poverty in that same kingdom. 
ECC.4.15	 I saw all living people moving about under the sun. They sided with the second young man, the king’s successor. 
ECC.4.16	 There was no end to all those people, everyone whom he led.
ECC.5.1	 Watch your step when you go to the house of God. It is better to go there and listen than to bring the sacrifices fools bring. Fools are unaware that they are doing ⌊something⌋ evil.
ECC.5.2	 Don’t be in a hurry to talk. Don’t be eager to speak in the presence of God. Since God is in heaven and you are on earth, limit the number of your words.
ECC.5.3	 Daydreaming comes when there are too many worries.
ECC.5.3	Careless speaking comes when there are too many words.
ECC.5.4	 When you make a promise to God, don’t be slow to keep it because God doesn’t like fools. Keep your promise. 
ECC.5.5	 It is better not to make a promise than to make one and not keep it. 
ECC.5.6	 Don’t let your mouth talk you into committing a sin. Don’t say in the presence of a ⌊temple⌋ messenger, “My promise was a mistake!” Why should God become angry at your excuse and destroy what you’ve accomplished?
ECC.5.7	 In spite of many daydreams, pointless actions, and empty words, you should still fear God.
ECC.5.8	 Don’t be surprised if you see poor people being oppressed, denied justice, or denied their rights in any district. One authority is watching over another, and they both have authorities watching over them. 
ECC.5.9	 Yet, a king is an advantage for a country with cultivated fields.
ECC.5.10	 Whoever loves money will never be satisfied with money. Whoever loves wealth will never be satisfied with more income. Even this is pointless. 
ECC.5.11	 As the number of goods increase, so do the number of people who consume them. What do owners gain ⌊from all their goods⌋ except ⌊the opportunity⌋ to look at them?
ECC.5.12	 The sleep of working people is sweet, whether they eat a little or a lot. But the full stomachs that rich people have will not allow them to sleep.
ECC.5.13	 There is a painful tragedy that I have seen under the sun: Riches lead to the downfall of those who hoard them. 
ECC.5.14	 These hoarded riches were then lost in bad business deals. The owners had children, but now they have nothing to give them. 
ECC.5.15	 They came from their mother’s womb naked. They will leave as naked as they came. They won’t even be able to take a handful of their earnings with them from all their hard work.
ECC.5.16	 This also is a painful tragedy: They leave exactly as they came. What advantage do they gain from working so hard for the wind? 
ECC.5.17	 They spend their entire lives in darkness, in constant frustration, sickness, and resentment.
ECC.5.18	 At last I have seen what is good and beautiful: It is to eat and drink and to enjoy the good in all our hard work under the sun during the brief lives God gives us. That is our lot ⌊in life⌋. 
ECC.5.19	 It is a gift from God when God gives some people wealth and possessions, the power to enjoy them, ⌊the ability⌋ to accept their lot in life, and ⌊the ability⌋ to rejoice in their own hard work. 
ECC.5.20	 These people won’t give much thought to their brief lives because God keeps them occupied with the joy in their hearts.
ECC.6.1	 There is a tragedy that I have seen under the sun. It is a terrible one for mortals. 
ECC.6.2	 God gives one person riches, wealth, and honor so that he doesn’t lack anything he wants. Yet, God doesn’t give him the power to enjoy any of them. Instead, a stranger enjoys them. This is pointless and is a painful tragedy.
ECC.6.3	 Suppose a rich person wasn’t satisfied with good things ⌊while he was alive⌋ and didn’t even get an honorable burial ⌊after he died⌋. Suppose he had a hundred children and lived for many years. No matter how long he would have lived, it ⌊still⌋ would have been better for him to have been born dead. 
ECC.6.4	 A stillborn baby arrives in a pointless birth and goes out into the darkness. The darkness then hides its name. 
ECC.6.5	 Though it has never seen the sun or known anything, the baby finds more rest than the rich person. 
ECC.6.6	 Even if the rich person lives two thousand years without experiencing anything good—don’t we all go to the same place?
ECC.6.7	 Everything that people work so hard for goes into their mouths, but their appetite is never satisfied.
ECC.6.8	 What advantage does a wise person have over a fool? What advantage does a poor person have in knowing how to face life?
ECC.6.9	 It is better to look at what is in front of you than to go looking for what you want. Even this is pointless. ⌊It’s like⌋ trying to catch the wind.
ECC.6.10	 Whatever has happened ⌊in the past⌋ already has a name. Mortals are already known for what they are. Mortals cannot argue with the one who is stronger than they.
ECC.6.11	 The more words there are, the more pointless they become. What advantage do mortals gain from this? 
ECC.6.12	 Who knows what may be good for mortals while they are alive, during the brief, pointless days they live? Mortals pass by like a shadow. Who will tell them about their future under the sun?
ECC.7.1	 A good name is better than expensive perfume, and the day you die is better than the day you’re born. 
ECC.7.2	 It is better to go to a funeral than to a banquet because that is where everyone will end up. Everyone who is alive should take this to heart! 
ECC.7.3	 Sorrow is better than laughter because, in spite of a sad face, the heart can be joyful. 
ECC.7.4	 The minds of wise people think about funerals, but the minds of fools think about banquets.
ECC.7.5	 It is better to listen to wise people who reprimand you than to fools who sing your praises. 
ECC.7.6	 The laughter of a fool is like the crackling of thorns burning under a pot. Even this is pointless.
ECC.7.7	 Oppression can turn a wise person into a fool, and a bribe can corrupt the mind.
ECC.7.8	 The end of something is better than its beginning. It is better to be patient than arrogant.
ECC.7.9	 Don’t be quick to get angry, because anger is typical of fools. 
ECC.7.10	 Don’t ask, “Why were things better in the old days than they are now?” It isn’t wisdom that leads you to ask this!
ECC.7.11	 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance. It is an advantage to everyone who sees the sun. 
ECC.7.12	 Wisdom protects us just as money protects us, but the advantage of wisdom is that it gives life to those who have it.
ECC.7.13	 Consider what God has done! Who can straighten what God has bent?
ECC.7.14	 When times are good, be happy. But when times are bad, consider this: God has made the one time as well as the other so that mortals cannot predict their future.
ECC.7.15	 I have seen it all in my pointless life:
ECC.7.15	Righteous people die in spite of being righteous.
ECC.7.15	Wicked people go on living in spite of being wicked.
ECC.7.16	 Don’t be too virtuous, and don’t be too wise. Why make yourself miserable? 
ECC.7.17	 Don’t be too wicked, and don’t be a fool. Why should you die before your time is up? 
ECC.7.18	 It’s good to hold on to the one and not let go of the other, because the one who fears God will be able to avoid both extremes.
ECC.7.19	 Wisdom will help a wise person more than ten rulers can help a city. 
ECC.7.20	 Certainly, there is no one so righteous on earth that he always does what is good and never sins.
ECC.7.21	 Don’t take everything that people say to heart, or you may hear your own servant cursing you. 
ECC.7.22	 Your conscience knows that you have cursed others many times.
ECC.7.23	 I used wisdom to test all of this. I said, “I want to be wise, but it is out of my reach.” 
ECC.7.24	 Whatever wisdom may be, it is out of reach. It is deep, very deep. Who can find out what it is? 
ECC.7.25	 I turned my attention to study, to explore, and to seek out wisdom and the reason for things. I learned that wickedness is stupid and foolishness is madness.
ECC.7.26	 I find that a woman whose thoughts are ⌊like⌋ traps and snares is more bitter than death itself. Even her hands are ⌊like⌋ chains. Whoever pleases God will escape her, but she will catch whoever continues to sin.
ECC.7.27	 The spokesman said, “This is what I’ve found: I added one thing to another in order to find a reason for things. 
ECC.7.28	 I am still seeking a reason for things, but have not found any. I found one man out of a thousand who had it, but out of all these I didn’t find one woman. 
ECC.7.29	 I have found only this: God made people decent, but they looked for many ways ⌊to avoid being decent⌋.” 
ECC.8.1	 Who is really wise? Who knows how to explain things? Wisdom makes one’s face shine, and it changes one’s grim look.
ECC.8.2	 I ⌊advise⌋ you to obey the king’s commands because of the oath you took in God’s presence. 
ECC.8.3	 Don’t be in a hurry to leave the king’s service. Don’t take part in something evil, because he can do whatever he pleases. 
ECC.8.4	 Since a king’s word has such power, no one can ask him what he is doing. 
ECC.8.5	 Whoever obeys his commands will avoid trouble. The mind of a wise person will know the right time and the right way ⌊to act⌋. 
ECC.8.6	 There is a right time and a right way ⌊to act⌋ in every situation. Yet, a terrible human tragedy hangs over people.
ECC.8.7	 They don’t know what the future will bring. So who can tell them how things will turn out? 
ECC.8.8	 No one has the power to prevent the spirit 
ECC.8.9	 I have seen all of this, and I have carefully considered all that is done under the sun whenever one person has authority to hurt others. 
ECC.8.10	 Then I saw wicked people given an ⌊honorable⌋ burial. They used to go in and out of the holy place. They were praised in the city for doing such things. Even this is pointless.
ECC.8.11	 When a sentence against a crime isn’t carried out quickly, people are encouraged to commit crimes. 
ECC.8.12	 A sinner may commit a hundred crimes and yet live a long life. Still, I know with certainty that it will go well for those who fear God, because they fear him. 
ECC.8.13	 But it will not go well for the wicked. They will not live any longer. Their lives are like shadows, because they don’t fear God.
ECC.8.14	 There is something being done on earth that is pointless. Righteous people suffer for what the wicked do, and wicked people get what the righteous deserve. I say that even this is pointless.
ECC.8.15	 So I recommend the enjoyment ⌊of life⌋. People have nothing better to do under the sun than to eat, drink, and enjoy themselves. This joy will stay with them while they work hard during their brief lives which God has given them under the sun.
ECC.8.16	 When I carefully considered how to study wisdom and how to look at the work that is done on earth (even going without sleep day and night), 
ECC.8.17	 then I saw everything that God has done. No one is able to grasp the work that is done under the sun. However hard a person may search for it, he will not find ⌊its meaning⌋. Even though a wise person claims to know, he is not able to grasp it.
ECC.9.1	 Now, I have carefully thought about all this, and I explain it in this way: Righteous people and wise people, along with their accomplishments, are in God’s hands. No one knows whether there will be love or hatred. 
ECC.9.2	 Everything turns out the same way for everyone. All people will share the same destiny, whether they are righteous, wicked, or good, clean or unclean,
ECC.9.3	 This is the tragedy of everything that happens under the sun: Everyone shares the same destiny. Moreover, the hearts of mortals are full of evil. Madness is in their hearts while they are still alive. After that, they join the dead. 
ECC.9.4	 But all who are among the living have hope, because a living dog is better than a dead lion. 
ECC.9.5	 The living know that they will die, but the dead don’t know anything. There is no more reward for the dead when the memory of them has faded. 
ECC.9.6	 Their love, their hate, and their passions have already vanished. They will never again take part in anything that happens under the sun.
ECC.9.7	 Go, enjoy eating your food, and drink your wine cheerfully, because God has already accepted what you’ve done. 
ECC.9.8	 Always wear clean clothes, and never go without lotion on your head. 
ECC.9.9	 Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, during all your brief, pointless life. God has given you your pointless life under the sun. This is your lot ⌊in life⌋ and what you get for the hard work that you do under the sun.
ECC.9.10	 Whatever presents itself for you to do, do it with ⌊all⌋ your might, because there is no work, planning, knowledge, or skill in the grave where you’re going.
ECC.9.11	 I saw something else under the sun. The race isn’t ⌊won⌋ by fast runners, or the battle by heroes. Wise people don’t necessarily have food. Intelligent people don’t necessarily have riches, and skilled people don’t necessarily receive special treatment. But time and unpredictable events overtake all of them. 
ECC.9.12	 No one knows when his time will come. Like fish that are caught in a cruel net or birds caught in a snare, humans are trapped by a disaster when it suddenly strikes them.
ECC.9.13	 I also have seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it made a deep impression on me. 
ECC.9.14	 There was a small town with a few soldiers in it, and a powerful king came to attack it. He surrounded it and blockaded it. 
ECC.9.15	 A poor, wise person was found in that town. He saved the town using his wisdom. But no one remembered that poor person. 
ECC.9.16	 So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength,” even though that poor person’s wisdom was despised, and no one listened to what he said.
ECC.9.17	 One should pay more attention to calm words from wise people than shouting from a ruler of fools. 
ECC.9.18	 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner can destroy much that is good.
ECC.10.1	 Dead flies will make a bottle of perfume stink, and then it is spoiled. A little foolishness outweighs wisdom ⌊and⌋ honor.
ECC.10.2	 A wise person’s heart leads the right way. The heart of a fool leads the wrong way. 
ECC.10.3	 Even when a fool goes walking, he has no sense and shows everyone else that he’s a fool.
ECC.10.4	 If a ruler becomes angry with you, don’t resign your position. If you remain calm, you can make up for serious offenses.
ECC.10.5	 There is a tragedy that I’ve seen under the sun, an error often made by rulers. 
ECC.10.6	 Foolish people are often given high positions, and rich people are left to fill lower positions. 
ECC.10.7	 I have seen slaves sitting on horses and influential people going on foot like slaves.
ECC.10.8	 Whoever digs a pit may fall into it. Whoever breaks through a stone wall may be bitten by a snake. 
ECC.10.9	 Whoever works in a stone quarry may get hurt. Whoever splits wood may be injured.
ECC.10.10	 If an ax is blunt and the edge isn’t sharpened, then one has to use more strength. But wisdom prepares the way for success. 
ECC.10.11	 If a snake bites before it has been charmed, then there is no advantage in being a snake charmer.
ECC.10.12	 A wise person’s words win favors, but a fool’s lips are self-destructive. 
ECC.10.13	 A fool starts out by talking foolishness and ends up saying crazy things that are dangerous. 
ECC.10.14	 He never stops talking. No one knows what the future will bring, or what will happen after ⌊death⌋. Who can say! 
ECC.10.15	 Fools wear themselves out with hard work, because they don’t even know the way to town.
ECC.10.16	 How horrible it will be for any country where the king used to be a servant and where the high officials throw parties in the morning. 
ECC.10.17	 A country is blessed when the king is from a noble family and when the high officials eat at the right time in order to get strength and not to get drunk.
ECC.10.18	 A roof sags because of laziness. A house leaks because of idle hands.
ECC.10.19	 A meal is made for laughter, and wine makes life pleasant, but money is the answer for everything.
ECC.10.20	 Don’t curse the king even in your thoughts, and don’t curse rich people even in your bedroom. A bird may carry your words, or some winged creature may repeat what you say.
ECC.11.1	 Throw your bread on the surface of the water, because you will find it again after many days.
ECC.11.2	 Divide what you have into seven parts, or even into eight, because you don’t know what disaster may happen on earth.
ECC.11.3	 If the clouds are full of rain, they will let it pour down on the earth. If a tree falls north or south, the tree will remain where it fell.
ECC.11.4	 Whoever watches the wind will never plant. Whoever looks at the clouds will never harvest.
ECC.11.5	 Just as you don’t know how the breath of life enters the limbs of a child within its mother’s womb, you also don’t understand how God, who made everything, works.
ECC.11.6	 Plant your seed in the morning, and don’t let your hands rest until evening. You don’t know whether this field or that field will be profitable or whether both of them will ⌊turn out⌋ equally well.
ECC.11.7	 Light is sweet, and it is good for one’s eyes to see the sun. 
ECC.11.8	 Even though people may live for many years, they should enjoy every one of them. But they should also remember there will be many dark days. Everything that is coming is pointless.
ECC.11.9	 You young people should enjoy yourselves while you’re young. You should let your hearts make you happy when you’re young. Follow wherever your heart leads you and whatever your eyes see. But realize that God will make you give an account for all these things when he judges everyone. 
ECC.11.10	 Get rid of what troubles you or wears down your body, because childhood and youth are pointless.
ECC.12.1	 Remember your Creator when you are young,
ECC.12.1	before the days of trouble come
ECC.12.1	and the years catch up with you.
ECC.12.1	They will make you say,
ECC.12.1	“I have found no pleasure in them.”
ECC.12.2	 Remember your Creator before the sun, the light, the moon,
ECC.12.2	and the stars turn dark, ⌊and⌋ the clouds come back with rain.
ECC.12.3	 Remember your Creator when those who guard the house tremble,
ECC.12.3	strong men are stooped over,
ECC.12.3	the women at the mill stop grinding
ECC.12.3	because there are so few of them,
ECC.12.3	⌊and⌋ those who look out of the windows
ECC.12.3	see a dim light.
ECC.12.4	 Remember your Creator when the doors to the street are closed,
ECC.12.4	the sound of the mill is muffled,
ECC.12.4	you are startled at the sound of a bird,
ECC.12.4	⌊and⌋ those who sing songs become quiet.
ECC.12.5	 Remember your Creator when someone is afraid of heights
ECC.12.5	and of dangers along the road,
ECC.12.5	the almond tree blossoms,
ECC.12.5	the grasshopper drags itself along,
ECC.12.5	⌊and⌋ the caper bush has ⌊no⌋ fruit.
ECC.12.5	Mortals go to their eternal rest, and mourners go out in the streets.
ECC.12.6	 Remember your Creator before the silver cord is snapped,
ECC.12.6	the golden bowl is broken,
ECC.12.6	the pitcher is smashed near the spring,
ECC.12.6	and the water wheel is broken at the cistern.
ECC.12.7	 Then the dust ⌊of mortals⌋ goes back to the ground as it was before,
ECC.12.7	and the breath of life goes back to God who gave it.
ECC.12.8	 “Absolutely pointless!” says the spokesman. “Everything is pointless!”
ECC.12.9	 Besides being wise, the spokesman also taught the people what he knew. He very carefully thought about it, studied it, and arranged it in many proverbs. 
ECC.12.10	 The spokesman tried to find just the right words. He wrote the words of truth very carefully.
ECC.12.11	 Words from wise people are like spurs. Their collected sayings are like nails that have been driven in firmly. They come from one shepherd. 
ECC.12.12	 Be warned, my children, against anything more than these. People never stop writing books. Too much studying will wear out your body. 
ECC.12.13	 After having heard it all, this is the conclusion: Fear God, and keep his commands, because this applies to everyone. 
ECC.12.14	 God will certainly judge everything that is done. This includes every secret thing, whether it is good or bad.
SNG.1.1	 The most beautiful song of Solomon.
SNG.1.1	   
SNG.1.2	 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.
SNG.1.2	Your expressions of love are better than wine,
SNG.1.3	 better than the fragrance of cologne.
SNG.1.3	(Cologne should be named after you.)
SNG.1.3	No wonder the young women love you!
SNG.1.4	 Take me with you. Let’s run away.
SNG.1.4	The king has brought me into his private rooms.
SNG.1.4	We will celebrate and rejoice with you.
SNG.1.4	We will praise your expressions of love more than wine.
SNG.1.4	How right it is that the young women love you!
SNG.1.5	 Young women of Jerusalem, I am dark and lovely
SNG.1.5	like Kedar’s tents,
SNG.1.5	like Solomon’s curtains.
SNG.1.6	 Stop staring at me because I am so dark.
SNG.1.6	The sun has tanned me.
SNG.1.6	My brothers were angry with me.
SNG.1.6	They made me the caretaker of the vineyards.
SNG.1.6	I have not even taken care of my own vineyard.
SNG.1.7	 Please tell me, you whom I love, where do you graze your flock?
SNG.1.7	Where does your flock lie down at noon?
SNG.1.7	⌊Tell me,⌋ or I will be considered a prostitute
SNG.1.7	⌊wandering⌋ among the flocks of your companions.
SNG.1.8	 If you do not know, most beautiful of women,
SNG.1.8	follow the tracks of the flocks,
SNG.1.8	and graze your young goats near the shepherds’ tents.
SNG.1.9	 My true love, I compare you to a mare among Pharaoh’s stallions.
SNG.1.10	 Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,
SNG.1.10	your neck with strings of pearls.
SNG.1.11	 We will make gold ornaments with silver beads for you.
SNG.1.12	 While the king is at his table,
SNG.1.12	my perfume fills the air with its fragrance.
SNG.1.13	 My beloved is a pouch of myrrh 
SNG.1.13	that lies at night between my breasts.
SNG.1.14	 My beloved is a bouquet of henna flowers
SNG.1.14	in the vineyards of En Gedi.
SNG.1.15	 Look at you! You are beautiful, my true love!
SNG.1.15	Look at you! You are so beautiful!
SNG.1.15	Your eyes are like doves!
SNG.1.16	 Look at you! You are handsome, my beloved, so pleasing to me!
SNG.1.16	The leaf-scattered ground will be our couch.
SNG.1.17	 The cedars will be the walls of our house.
SNG.1.17	The cypress trees will be our rafters.
SNG.2.1	 I am a rose of Sharon,
SNG.2.1	a lily ⌊growing⌋ in the valleys.
SNG.2.2	 Like a lily among thorns,
SNG.2.2	so is my true love among the young women.
SNG.2.3	 Like an apple tree among the trees in the forest,
SNG.2.3	so is my beloved among the young men.
SNG.2.3	I want to sit in his shadow.
SNG.2.3	His fruit tastes sweet to me.
SNG.2.4	 He leads me into a banquet room
SNG.2.4	and looks at me with love.
SNG.2.5	 Strengthen me with raisins
SNG.2.5	and refresh me with apples
SNG.2.5	because I am weak from love.
SNG.2.6	 His left hand is under my head.
SNG.2.6	His right hand caresses me.
SNG.2.7	 Young women of Jerusalem, swear to me
SNG.2.7	by the gazelles
SNG.2.7	or by the does in the field
SNG.2.7	that you will not awaken love
SNG.2.7	or arouse love before its proper time.
SNG.2.8	 I hear my beloved’s voice.
SNG.2.8	Look! Here he comes,
SNG.2.8	sprinting over the mountains,
SNG.2.8	racing over the hills.
SNG.2.9	 My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.
SNG.2.9	Look! There he stands behind our wall,
SNG.2.9	peeking through the window,
SNG.2.9	looking through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	 My beloved said to me,
SNG.2.10	“Get up, my true love, my beautiful one, and come with me.
SNG.2.11	 Look! The winter is past.
SNG.2.11	The rain is over and gone.
SNG.2.12	 Blossoms appear in the land.
SNG.2.12	The time of the songbird has arrived.
SNG.2.12	The cooing of the mourning dove is heard in our land.
SNG.2.13	 The green figs ripen.
SNG.2.13	The grapevines bloom and give off a fragrance.
SNG.2.13	Get up, my true love, my beautiful one, and come with me.
SNG.2.14	 My dove, in the hiding places of the rocky crevices,
SNG.2.14	in the secret places of the cliffs,
SNG.2.14	let me see your figure and hear your voice.
SNG.2.14	Your voice is sweet, and your figure is lovely.”
SNG.2.15	 Catch the foxes for us,
SNG.2.15	the little foxes that ruin vineyards.
SNG.2.15	Our vineyards are blooming.
SNG.2.16	 My beloved is mine, and I am his.
SNG.2.16	He is the one who grazes his flock among the lilies.
SNG.2.17	 When the day brings a cooling breeze and the shadows flee,
SNG.2.17	turn around, my beloved.
SNG.2.17	Run like a gazelle or a young stag
SNG.2.17	on the mountains that separate us!
SNG.3.1	 Night after night on my bed
SNG.3.1	I looked for the one I love.
SNG.3.1	I looked for him but did not find him.
SNG.3.2	 I will get up now and roam around the city,
SNG.3.2	in the streets, and in the squares.
SNG.3.2	I will look for the one I love.
SNG.3.2	I looked for him but did not find him.
SNG.3.3	 The watchmen making their rounds in the city found me.
SNG.3.3	⌊I asked,⌋ “Have you seen the one I love?”
SNG.3.4	 I had just left them when I found the one I love.
SNG.3.4	I held on to him and would not let him go
SNG.3.4	until I had brought him into my mother’s house,
SNG.3.4	into the bedroom of the one who conceived me.
SNG.3.5	 Young women of Jerusalem, swear to me
SNG.3.5	by the gazelles
SNG.3.5	or by the does in the field,
SNG.3.5	that you will not awaken love
SNG.3.5	or arouse love before its proper time.
SNG.3.6	 Who is this young woman coming up from the wilderness
SNG.3.6	like clouds of smoke?
SNG.3.6	She is perfumed with myrrh and incense
SNG.3.6	made from the merchants’ scented powders.
SNG.3.7	 Look! Solomon’s sedan chair! 
SNG.3.7	Sixty soldiers from the army of Israel surround it.
SNG.3.8	 All of them are skilled in using swords,
SNG.3.8	experienced in combat.
SNG.3.8	Each one has his sword at his side
SNG.3.8	and guards against the terrors of the night.
SNG.3.9	 King Solomon had a carriage made for himself 
SNG.3.9	from the wood of Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	 He had its posts made out of silver,
SNG.3.10	its top out of gold,
SNG.3.10	its seat out of purple fabric.
SNG.3.10	Its inside—with inlaid scenes of love—
SNG.3.10	was made by the young women of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	 Young women of Zion, come out and look at King Solomon!
SNG.3.11	Look at his crown,
SNG.3.11	the crown his mother placed on him on his wedding day,
SNG.3.11	his day of joyful delight.
SNG.4.1	 Look at you! You are beautiful, my true love.
SNG.4.1	Look at you! You are so beautiful.
SNG.4.1	Your eyes behind your veil are like doves.
SNG.4.1	Your hair is like a flock of goats moving down Mount Gilead.
SNG.4.2	 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep about to be sheared,
SNG.4.2	sheep that come up from the washing.
SNG.4.2	All of them bear twins, and not one has lost its young.
SNG.4.3	 Your lips are like scarlet thread.
SNG.4.3	Your mouth is lovely.
SNG.4.3	Your temples behind your veil are like slices of pomegranate.
SNG.4.4	 Your neck is like David’s beautifully-designed 
SNG.4.4	A thousand round shields belonging to soldiers
SNG.4.4	are hung on it.
SNG.4.5	 Your breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.4.5	like twin gazelles grazing among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	 When the day brings a cool breeze and the shadows flee,
SNG.4.6	I will go to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of incense.
SNG.4.7	 You are beautiful in every way, my true love.
SNG.4.7	There is no blemish on you.
SNG.4.8	 You will come with me from Lebanon,
SNG.4.8	from Lebanon as my bride.
SNG.4.8	You will travel with me
SNG.4.8	from the peak of Mount Amana,
SNG.4.8	from the mountain peaks in Senir and Hermon,
SNG.4.8	from the lairs of lions,
SNG.4.8	from the mountains of leopards.
SNG.4.9	 My bride, my sister, you have charmed me.
SNG.4.9	You have charmed me
SNG.4.9	with a single glance from your eyes,
SNG.4.9	with a single strand of your necklace.
SNG.4.10	 How beautiful are your expressions of love, my bride, my sister!
SNG.4.10	How much better are your expressions of love than wine
SNG.4.10	and the fragrance of your perfume than any spice.
SNG.4.11	 Your lips drip honey, my bride.
SNG.4.11	Honey and milk are under your tongue.
SNG.4.11	The fragrance of your clothing is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	 My bride, my sister is a garden that is locked,
SNG.4.12	a garden that is locked,
SNG.4.12	a spring that is sealed.
SNG.4.13	 You are paradise that produces
SNG.4.13	pomegranates and the best fruits,
SNG.4.13	henna flowers and nard,
SNG.4.14	 nard and saffron,
SNG.4.14	calamus,
SNG.4.14	myrrh, aloes, and all the best spices.
SNG.4.15	 ⌊You are⌋ a spring for gardens,
SNG.4.15	a well of living water flowing from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	 Awake, north wind!
SNG.4.16	Come, south wind!
SNG.4.16	Blow on my garden!
SNG.4.16	Let its spices flow from it.
SNG.4.16	Let my beloved come to his garden,
SNG.4.16	and let him eat his own precious fruit.
SNG.5.1	 My bride, my sister, I will come to my garden.
SNG.5.1	I will gather my myrrh with my spice.
SNG.5.1	I will eat my honeycomb with my honey.
SNG.5.1	I will drink my wine with my milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, my friends!
SNG.5.1	Drink and become intoxicated with expressions of love!
SNG.5.2	 I sleep, but my mind is awake.
SNG.5.2	Listen! My beloved is knocking.
SNG.5.2	Open to me, my true love, my sister,
SNG.5.2	my dove, my perfect one.
SNG.5.2	My head is wet with dew,
SNG.5.2	my hair with the dewdrops of night.
SNG.5.3	 I have taken off my clothes! Why should I put them on ⌊again⌋?
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet! Why should I get them dirty ⌊again⌋?
SNG.5.4	 My beloved put his hand through the keyhole.
SNG.5.4	My heart throbbed for him.
SNG.5.5	 I got up to open for my beloved.
SNG.5.5	My hands dripped with myrrh,
SNG.5.5	and my fingers were drenched with liquid myrrh,
SNG.5.5	on the handles of the lock.
SNG.5.6	 I opened for my beloved,
SNG.5.6	but my beloved had turned away. He was gone!
SNG.5.6	I almost died when he left.
SNG.5.6	I looked for him, but I did not find him.
SNG.5.6	I called for him, but he did not answer me.
SNG.5.7	 The watchmen making their rounds in the city found me.
SNG.5.7	They struck me!
SNG.5.7	They wounded me!
SNG.5.7	Those watchmen on the walls took my robe from me!
SNG.5.8	 Young women of Jerusalem, swear to me
SNG.5.8	that if you find my beloved
SNG.5.8	you will tell him I am hopelessly lovesick.
SNG.5.9	 Most beautiful of women,
SNG.5.9	what makes your beloved better than any other beloved?
SNG.5.9	What makes your beloved better than any other beloved
SNG.5.9	that you make us swear this way?
SNG.5.10	 My beloved is dazzling yet ruddy.
SNG.5.10	He stands out among 10,000 men.
SNG.5.11	 His head is the finest gold.
SNG.5.11	His hair is wavy, black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	 His eyes are set like doves bathing in milk.
SNG.5.13	 His cheeks are like a garden of spices,
SNG.5.13	a garden that produces scented herbs.
SNG.5.13	His lips are lilies that drip with myrrh.
SNG.5.14	 His hands are disks of gold set with emerald.
SNG.5.14	His chest is a block of ivory covered with sapphires.
SNG.5.15	 His legs are columns of marble set on bases of pure gold.
SNG.5.15	His form is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
SNG.5.16	 His mouth is sweet in every way.
SNG.5.16	Everything about him is desirable!
SNG.5.16	This is my beloved, and this is my friend, young women of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	 Where did your beloved go, most beautiful of women?
SNG.6.1	Where did your beloved turn?
SNG.6.1	We will look for him with you.
SNG.6.2	 My beloved went to his garden,
SNG.6.2	to the beds of spices,
SNG.6.2	to graze his flock in the gardens and gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	 I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine.
SNG.6.3	He is the one who grazes his flock among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	 You are beautiful, my true love, like Tirzah,
SNG.6.4	lovely like Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	awe-inspiring like those great cities.
SNG.6.5	 Turn your eyes away from me. They enchant me!
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like a flock of goats moving down from Gilead.
SNG.6.6	 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep,
SNG.6.6	sheep that come up from the washing.
SNG.6.6	All of them bear twins, and not one has lost its young.
SNG.6.7	 Your temples behind your veil are like slices of pomegranate.
SNG.6.8	 There are 60 queens, 80 concubines,
SNG.6.9	 but she is unique, my dove, my perfect one.
SNG.6.9	Her mother thinks she is unique.
SNG.6.9	She is pure to the one who gave birth to her.
SNG.6.9	Her sisters saw her and blessed her.
SNG.6.9	Queens and concubines saw her and praised her.
SNG.6.10	 Who is this young woman?
SNG.6.10	She looks like the dawn.
SNG.6.10	She is beautiful like the moon,
SNG.6.10	pure like the sun,
SNG.6.10	awe-inspiring like those heavenly bodies.
SNG.6.11	 I went to the walnut grove
SNG.6.11	to look at the blossoms in the valley,
SNG.6.11	to see if the grapevine had budded
SNG.6.11	and if the pomegranates were in bloom.
SNG.6.12	 I did not know that I had become
SNG.6.12	like the chariots of my noble people.
SNG.6.13	 Come back! Come back, young woman from Shulam!
SNG.6.13	Come back! Come back so that we may look at you!
SNG.6.13	Why do you look at me, the young woman from Shulam,
SNG.6.13	as you look at the dance of Mahanaim?
SNG.7.1	 How beautiful are your feet in their sandals, noble daughter!
SNG.7.1	The curves of your thighs are like ornaments,
SNG.7.1	like the work of an artist’s hands.
SNG.7.2	 Your navel is a round bowl.
SNG.7.2	May it always be filled with spiced wine.
SNG.7.2	Your waist is a bundle of wheat enclosed in lilies.
SNG.7.3	 Your breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.7.3	twins of a gazelle.
SNG.7.4	 Your neck is like an ivory tower.
SNG.7.4	Your eyes are like pools in Heshbon, pools by the gate of Bath Rabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like a Lebanese tower facing Damascus.
SNG.7.5	 You hold your head as high as Mount Carmel.
SNG.7.5	Your dangling curls are royal beauty.
SNG.7.5	Your flowing locks could hold a king captive.
SNG.7.6	 How beautiful and charming you are, my love, with your elegance.
SNG.7.7	 Young woman,
SNG.7.7	your figure is like a palm tree,
SNG.7.7	and your breasts are like its clusters.
SNG.7.8	 I thought, “I will climb the palm tree
SNG.7.8	and take hold of its fruit.”
SNG.7.8	May your breasts be like clusters on the vine.
SNG.7.8	May the fragrance of your breath be like apples.
SNG.7.9	 May your mouth taste like the best wine . . .
SNG.7.9	. . . that goes down smoothly to my beloved
SNG.7.9	and glides over the lips of those about to sleep.
SNG.7.10	 I am my beloved’s, and he longs for me.
SNG.7.11	 Come, my beloved.
SNG.7.11	Let’s go into the field.
SNG.7.11	Let’s spend the night among the henna flowers.
SNG.7.12	 Let’s go to the vineyards early.
SNG.7.12	Let’s see if the vines have budded,
SNG.7.12	if the grape blossoms have opened,
SNG.7.12	if the pomegranates are in bloom.
SNG.7.12	There I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	 The mandrakes 
SNG.7.13	and at our door are all kinds of precious fruits.
SNG.7.13	I have saved new and old things
SNG.7.13	for you alone, my beloved.
SNG.8.1	 If only you were my brother,
SNG.8.1	one who nursed at my mother’s breasts.
SNG.8.1	If I saw you on the street,
SNG.8.1	I would kiss you, and no one would look down on me.
SNG.8.2	 I would lead you.
SNG.8.2	I would bring you into my mother’s house.
SNG.8.2	(She is the one who was my teacher.)
SNG.8.2	I would give you some spiced wine to drink,
SNG.8.2	some juice squeezed from my pomegranates.
SNG.8.3	 His left hand is under my head.
SNG.8.3	His right hand caresses me.
SNG.8.4	 Young women of Jerusalem, swear to me
SNG.8.4	that you will not awaken love
SNG.8.4	or arouse love before its proper time!
SNG.8.5	 Who is this young woman coming from the wilderness
SNG.8.5	with her arm around her beloved?
SNG.8.5	Under the apple tree I woke you up.
SNG.8.5	There your mother went into labor with you.
SNG.8.5	There she went into labor
SNG.8.5	and gave birth to you!
SNG.8.6	 Wear me as a signet ring on your heart,
SNG.8.6	as a ring on your hand.
SNG.8.6	Love is as overpowering as death.
SNG.8.6	Devotion is as unyielding as the grave.
SNG.8.6	Love’s flames are flames of fire,
SNG.8.6	flames that come from the L
SNG.8.7	 Raging water cannot extinguish love,
SNG.8.7	and rivers will never wash it away.
SNG.8.7	If a man exchanged all his family’s wealth for love,
SNG.8.7	people would utterly despise him.
SNG.8.8	 We have a little sister, and she has no breasts.
SNG.8.8	What will we do for our sister on the day she becomes engaged?
SNG.8.9	 If she is a wall, we will build a silver barrier around her.
SNG.8.9	If she is a door, we will barricade her with cedar boards.
SNG.8.10	 I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers.
SNG.8.10	So he considers me to be one who has found peace.
SNG.8.11	 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon.
SNG.8.11	He entrusted that vineyard to caretakers.
SNG.8.11	Each one was to bring 25 pounds of silver
SNG.8.11	in exchange for its fruit.
SNG.8.12	 My own vineyard is in front of me.
SNG.8.12	That 25 pounds is yours, Solomon,
SNG.8.12	and 5 pounds go to those who take care of its fruit.
SNG.8.13	 Young woman living in the gardens,
SNG.8.13	while your friends are listening to your voice,
SNG.8.13	let me hear. . . .
SNG.8.14	 Come away quickly, my beloved.
SNG.8.14	Run like a gazelle or a young stag
SNG.8.14	on the mountains of spices.
ISA.1.1	 This is the vision which Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem at the time of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.

ISA.1.6	 From the bottom of your feet to the top of your head
ISA.1.6	there is no healthy spot left on your ⌊body⌋—
ISA.1.6	only bruises, sores, and fresh wounds.

ISA.1.7	 “Your country is devastated.
ISA.1.7	Your cities are burned down.
ISA.1.7	Your fields are destroyed right before your eyes by foreigners.
ISA.1.7	Your fields are devastated and taken over by foreigners.

ISA.1.9	 If the L
ISA.1.9	we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	 Listen to the word of the L
ISA.1.10	Pay attention to the teachings from our God, you people of Gomorrah!
ISA.1.11	 The L
ISA.1.11	I’ve had enough of your burnt offerings of rams
ISA.1.11	and enough fat from your fattened calves.
ISA.1.11	I’m not pleased with the blood of bulls, lambs, or male goats.
ISA.1.12	 When you appear in my presence,
ISA.1.12	who asked you to trample on my courtyards?
ISA.1.13	 Don’t bring any more worthless grain offerings.
ISA.1.13	Your incense is disgusting to me,
ISA.1.13	so are your New Moon Festivals, your days of worship,
ISA.1.13	and the assemblies you call.
ISA.1.13	I can’t stand your evil assemblies.
ISA.1.14	 I hate your New Moon Festivals and your appointed festivals.
ISA.1.14	They’ve become a burden to me,
ISA.1.14	and I’m tired of putting up with them.
ISA.1.15	 So when you stretch out your hands ⌊in prayer⌋,
ISA.1.15	I will turn my eyes away from you.
ISA.1.15	Even though you offer many prayers,
ISA.1.15	I will not listen because your hands are covered with blood.
ISA.1.16	 “Wash yourselves! Become clean!

ISA.1.18	Though they are dark red,

ISA.1.20	The L
ISA.1.21	 How the faithful town has become a prostitute!
ISA.1.21	She was full of justice,
ISA.1.21	and righteousness lived in her.
ISA.1.21	But now murderers live there!
ISA.1.22	 Your silver is not pure.
ISA.1.22	Your wine is watered down.
ISA.1.23	 Your rulers are rebels, friends with thieves.
ISA.1.23	They all love bribes and run after gifts.
ISA.1.23	They never defend orphans.
ISA.1.23	They don’t notice the widows’ pleas.
ISA.1.24	 That’s why the Lord, the L
ISA.1.24	“How horrible it will be when I take revenge on my opponents!

ISA.1.30	and like a garden without water.
ISA.1.31	 Strong people will become tinder for a fire,
ISA.1.31	and their work will be the spark.
ISA.1.31	Both of them will burn together,
ISA.1.31	and there will be no one to put out the fire.
ISA.2.1	 This is the message which Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem.
ISA.2.2	 In the last days the mountain of the L
ISA.2.2	will be established as the highest of the mountains
ISA.2.2	and raised above the hills.
ISA.2.2	All the nations will stream to it.
ISA.2.3	 Then many people will come and say,
ISA.2.3	“Let’s go to the mountain of the L
ISA.2.3	to the house of the God of Jacob.
ISA.2.3	He will teach us his ways so that we may live by them.”
ISA.2.3	The teachings will go out from Zion.

ISA.2.5	 Come, descendants of Jacob,
ISA.2.5	let’s live in the light of the L
ISA.2.6	 L
ISA.2.6	because they are filled with Eastern influences.
ISA.2.6	They are fortunetellers like the Philistines,

ISA.2.7	Their land is filled with horses,
ISA.2.7	and there is no end to their chariots.
ISA.2.8	 Their land is filled with idols,
ISA.2.8	and they worship what their hands have shaped
ISA.2.8	and what their fingers have molded.
ISA.2.9	 People will be brought down. Everyone will be humbled.
ISA.2.9	Do not forgive them.
ISA.2.10	 Go in among the rocks and hide underground
ISA.2.10	because of the L

ISA.2.17	 Then arrogant people will be brought down,
ISA.2.17	and high and mighty people will be humbled.
ISA.2.17	On that day the L
ISA.2.18	 Then idols will disappear completely.
ISA.2.19	 People will go into caves in the rocks
ISA.2.19	and into holes in the ground
ISA.2.19	because of the L
ISA.2.19	and the honor of his majesty
ISA.2.19	when he rises to terrify the earth.
ISA.2.20	 On that day people will throw to the moles and the bats
ISA.2.20	the silver and gold idols that they made
ISA.2.20	for themselves to worship.
ISA.2.21	 They will go into caves in the rocks
ISA.2.21	and into cracks in the cliffs
ISA.2.21	because of the L

ISA.3.5	The young will make fun of the old,
ISA.3.5	and common people will make fun of their superiors.
ISA.3.6	 A person will grab one of his relatives
ISA.3.6	from his father’s family and say,
ISA.3.6	“You have a coat.
ISA.3.6	You’ll be our leader.
ISA.3.6	This pile of ruins will be under your control.”
ISA.3.7	 When that day comes the relative will cry out,
ISA.3.7	“I’m not a doctor!
ISA.3.7	I don’t have any food or a coat in my home.
ISA.3.7	Don’t make me a leader of our family.”
ISA.3.8	 Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen,
ISA.3.8	because what they say and what they do is against the L
ISA.3.8	They are defiant in his honored presence.
ISA.3.9	 The look on their faces will be held against them.
ISA.3.9	They boast about their sins,
ISA.3.9	which are like ⌊those of the people of⌋ Sodom.
ISA.3.9	They don’t even bother to hide them.
ISA.3.9	How horrible it will be for these people,
ISA.3.9	because they have brought disaster on themselves.
ISA.3.10	 Tell the righteous that blessings will come to them.
ISA.3.10	They will taste the fruit of their labor.
ISA.3.11	 How horrible it will be for the wicked! Disaster will strike them.
ISA.3.11	What they have done will be done to them.
ISA.3.12	 “Children will oppress my people.
ISA.3.12	Women will rule them.
ISA.3.12	My people, your guides mislead you,

ISA.3.13	 The L
ISA.3.13	He stands to judge his people.
ISA.3.14	 The L
ISA.3.14	and the officials of his people:
ISA.3.14	“You have burned down the vineyard!
ISA.3.14	Your houses are filled with goods stolen from the poor.”
ISA.3.15	 The Almighty L
ISA.3.15	“How can you crush my people
ISA.3.15	and grind the faces of the poor ⌊into the ground⌋?”
ISA.3.16	 The L
ISA.3.16	“The women of Zion are arrogant.
ISA.3.16	They walk with their noses in the air,
ISA.3.16	making seductive glances,
ISA.3.16	taking short little steps,
ISA.3.16	jingling the ankle bracelets on their feet.”
ISA.3.17	 The Lord will cause sores ⌊to appear⌋
ISA.3.17	on the heads of the women of Zion,
ISA.3.17	and the L
ISA.3.18	 On that day the Lord will take away their fine things: jingling anklets, headbands, crescent-shaped necklaces, 
ISA.3.19	 pendants, bracelets, scarfs, 
ISA.3.20	 hats, ankle bracelets, blouses, perfume boxes, charms, 
ISA.3.21	 signet rings, nose rings, 
ISA.3.22	 fine robes, coats, shawls, purses, 
ISA.3.23	 mirrors, underwear, headdresses, and veils.
ISA.3.24	 Instead of the smell of perfume, there will be the smell of decay.
ISA.3.24	They will wear ropes instead of belts.
ISA.3.24	They will have bald heads instead of beautiful hair.
ISA.3.24	They will wear sackcloth instead of expensive clothes.
ISA.3.24	Their beauty will be scarred.
ISA.3.25	 ⌊Women,⌋ your warriors will die in combat.
ISA.3.25	Your mighty men will die in battle.
ISA.3.26	 The gates of Zion will cry and grieve,
ISA.3.26	and Zion will sit on the ground, exhausted.
ISA.4.1	 When that day comes, seven women will grab one man and say,
ISA.4.1	“We’ll eat our own food and provide our own clothes.
ISA.4.1	Just let us marry you for your name.
ISA.4.1	Take away our disgrace.”
ISA.4.2	 When that day comes, the branch of the L
ISA.4.2	will be beautiful and wonderful.
ISA.4.2	The fruit of the land
ISA.4.2	will be the pride and joy of Israel’s survivors.
ISA.4.3	 Then whoever is left in Zion and whoever remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem. 
ISA.4.4	 The Lord will wash away the filth of Zion’s people.
ISA.4.5	 The L
ISA.4.6	 It will be a shelter from the heat during the day as well as a refuge and hiding place from storms and rain.
ISA.5.1	 Let me sing a lovesong to my beloved about his vineyard:
ISA.5.1	My beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill.
ISA.5.2	 He dug it up, removed its stones,
ISA.5.2	planted it with the choicest vines,
ISA.5.2	built a watchtower in it,
ISA.5.2	and made a winepress in it.
ISA.5.2	Then he waited for it to produce good grapes,
ISA.5.2	but it produced only sour, wild grapes.
ISA.5.3	 Now then, you inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah,
ISA.5.3	judge between me and my vineyard!
ISA.5.4	 What more could have been done for my vineyard
ISA.5.4	than what I have already done for it?
ISA.5.4	When I waited for it to produce good grapes,
ISA.5.4	why did it produce only sour, wild grapes?
ISA.5.5	 Now then, let me tell you what I will do to my vineyard.
ISA.5.5	I will tear away its hedge so that it can be devoured
ISA.5.5	and tear down its wall so that it can be trampled.
ISA.5.6	 I will make it a wasteland.
ISA.5.6	It will never be pruned or hoed.
ISA.5.6	Thorns and weeds will grow in it,
ISA.5.6	and I will command the clouds not to rain on it.
ISA.5.7	 The vineyard of the L
ISA.5.7	and the people of Judah are the garden of his delight.
ISA.5.7	He hoped for justice but saw only slaughter,
ISA.5.7	for righteousness but heard only cries of distress.
ISA.5.8	 How horrible it will be for you
ISA.5.8	who acquire house after house and buy field after field
ISA.5.8	until there’s nothing left
ISA.5.8	and you have to live by yourself in the land.
ISA.5.9	 With my own ears I heard the L
ISA.5.9	“Many houses will become empty.
ISA.5.9	Large, beautiful houses will be without people to live in them.
ISA.5.10	 A ten-acre vineyard will produce only six gallons of wine,
ISA.5.10	and two quarts of seed will produce only four quarts of grain.”
ISA.5.11	 How horrible it will be for those
ISA.5.11	who get up early to look for a drink,
ISA.5.11	who sit up late until they are drunk from wine.
ISA.5.12	 At their feasts there are lyres and harps,
ISA.5.12	tambourines and flutes, and wine.
ISA.5.12	Yet, they don’t pay attention to what the L
ISA.5.12	or see what his hands have done.
ISA.5.13	 “My people will go into exile
ISA.5.13	because they don’t understand what I’m doing.
ISA.5.13	Honored men will starve,
ISA.5.13	and common people will be parched with thirst.”
ISA.5.14	 That is why the grave’s appetite increases.
ISA.5.14	It opens its mouth very wide
ISA.5.14	so that honored people and common people will go down into it.
ISA.5.14	Those who are noisy and joyous will go down into it.
ISA.5.15	 People will be brought down. Everyone will be humbled.
ISA.5.15	And the eyes of arrogant people will be humbled.
ISA.5.16	 The L
ISA.5.16	The holy God will show himself to be holy when he does what is right.
ISA.5.17	 Then lambs will graze as if they were in their own pasture,
ISA.5.17	and foreigners will eat among the ruins of the rich.
ISA.5.18	 How horrible it will be for those
ISA.5.18	who string people along with lies and empty promises,
ISA.5.18	whose lives are sinful.
ISA.5.19	 They say,
ISA.5.19	“Let God hurry and quickly do his work
ISA.5.19	so that we may see what he has in mind.
ISA.5.19	Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel happen quickly
ISA.5.19	so that we may understand what he is doing.”
ISA.5.20	 How horrible it will be for those
ISA.5.20	who call evil good and good evil,
ISA.5.20	who turn darkness into light and light into darkness,
ISA.5.20	who turn what is bitter into something sweet
ISA.5.20	and what is sweet into something bitter.
ISA.5.21	 How horrible it will be for those
ISA.5.21	who think they are wise
ISA.5.21	and consider themselves to be clever.
ISA.5.22	 How horrible it will be for those
ISA.5.22	who are heroes at drinking wine,
ISA.5.22	who are champions at mixing drinks,
ISA.5.23	 who declare the guilty innocent for a bribe,
ISA.5.23	who take away the rights of righteous people.
ISA.5.24	 As flames burn up straw
ISA.5.24	and dry grass shrivels in flames,
ISA.5.24	so their roots will rot,
ISA.5.24	and their blossoms will blow away like dust.
ISA.5.24	They have rejected the teachings of the L
ISA.5.24	and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.5.25	 That’s why the anger of the L
ISA.5.25	and he is ready to use his power to strike them down.
ISA.5.25	The hills tremble,
ISA.5.25	and dead bodies lie like garbage in the streets.
ISA.5.25	Even after all this, his anger has not disappeared,
ISA.5.25	and he is still ready to use his power.
ISA.5.26	 The L
ISA.5.26	With a whistle he signals those at the ends of the earth.
ISA.5.26	Look, they are coming very quickly!
ISA.5.27	 None of them grow tired or stumble.
ISA.5.27	None of them slumber or sleep.
ISA.5.27	The belts on their waists aren’t loose
ISA.5.27	or their sandal straps broken.
ISA.5.28	 Their arrows are sharpened; all their bows are ready to shoot.
ISA.5.28	Their horses’ hoofs are as hard as flint.
ISA.5.28	Their chariot wheels are as quick as the wind.
ISA.5.29	 They roar like a lioness.
ISA.5.29	They growl like a young lion.
ISA.5.29	They growl as they snatch their prey
ISA.5.29	and carry it off to where no one can rescue it.
ISA.5.30	 On that day they will roar over their prey
ISA.5.30	as the sea roars.
ISA.5.30	If they look at the land,
ISA.5.30	they will see only darkness and distress.
ISA.5.30	Even the light will be darkened by thick clouds.
ISA.6.1	 In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne. The bottom of his robe filled the temple. 
ISA.6.2	 Angels 
ISA.6.3	 They called to each other and said,
ISA.6.3	“Holy, holy, holy is the L
ISA.6.3	The whole earth is filled with his glory.”
ISA.6.4	 Their voices shook the foundations of the doorposts, and the temple filled with smoke.
ISA.6.5	 So I said, “Oh, no!
ISA.6.5	I’m doomed.
ISA.6.5	Every word that passes through my lips is sinful.
ISA.6.5	I live among people with sinful lips.
ISA.6.5	I have seen the king, the L
ISA.6.6	 Then one of the angels flew to me. In his hand was a burning coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs. 
ISA.6.7	 He touched my mouth with it and said, “This has touched your lips. Your guilt has been taken away, and your sin has been forgiven.”
ISA.6.8	 Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom will I send? Who will go for us?”
ISA.6.8	I said, “Here I am. Send me!”
ISA.6.9	 And he said, “Go and tell these people,
ISA.6.9	‘No matter how closely you listen, you’ll never understand.
ISA.6.9	No matter how closely you look, you’ll never see.’
ISA.6.10	 Make these people close-minded.
ISA.6.10	Plug their ears.
ISA.6.10	Shut their eyes.
ISA.6.10	Otherwise, they may see with their eyes,
ISA.6.10	hear with their ears,
ISA.6.10	understand with their minds,
ISA.6.10	and return and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	 I asked, “How long, O Lord?”
ISA.6.11	And he replied,
ISA.6.11	“Until the cities lie in ruins with no one living in them,
ISA.6.11	the houses have no people,
ISA.6.11	and the land is completely desolate.
ISA.6.12	 The L
ISA.6.12	and a large area in the middle of the land will be abandoned.
ISA.6.13	 Even if one out of ten people is left in it,
ISA.6.13	the land will be burned again.
ISA.6.13	When a sacred oak or an oak is cut down, a stump is left.
ISA.6.13	The holy seed will be the land’s stump.”
ISA.7.1	 When Ahaz, son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, was king of Judah, Aram’s King Rezin and Israel’s King Pekah, son of Remaliah, went to Jerusalem to attack it, but they couldn’t defeat it. 
ISA.7.2	 When word reached David’s family that the Arameans had made an alliance with Ephraim, the hearts of the king and his people were shaken as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.
ISA.7.3	 Then the L
ISA.7.4	 Say to him, ‘Be careful, stay calm, and don’t be afraid. Don’t lose heart because of the fierce anger of Rezin from Aram and Remaliah’s son. These two are smoldering logs.’ 
ISA.7.5	 Aram, Ephraim, and Remaliah’s son have planned evil against you, saying, 
ISA.7.6	 ‘Let’s march against Judah, tear it apart, divide it among ourselves, and set up Tabeel’s son as its king.’ 
ISA.7.7	 This is what the Almighty L
ISA.7.7	It won’t take place; it won’t happen.
ISA.7.8	 The capital of Aram is Damascus,
ISA.7.8	and the leader of Damascus is Rezin.
ISA.7.8	Ephraim will be shattered within 65 years
ISA.7.8	so that it will no longer be a nation.
ISA.7.9	 The capital of Ephraim is Samaria,
ISA.7.9	and the leader of Samaria is Remaliah’s son.
ISA.7.9	If you don’t remain faithful,
ISA.7.9	you won’t remain standing.
ISA.7.10	 Again the L
ISA.7.11	 “Ask the L
ISA.7.12	 But Ahaz answered, “I won’t ask; I wouldn’t think of testing the L
ISA.7.13	 “Listen now, descendants of David,” Isaiah said. “Isn’t it enough that you try the patience of mortals? Must you also try the patience of my God? 
ISA.7.14	 So the Lord himself will give you this sign: A virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and she will name him Immanuel [God Is With Us]. 
ISA.7.15	 He will eat cheese and honey until he knows how to reject evil and choose good. 
ISA.7.16	 Indeed, before the boy knows how to reject evil and choose good, the land of the two kings who terrify you will be deserted.
ISA.7.17	 “The L
ISA.7.18	 On that day the L
ISA.7.19	 All of them will come and settle in the deep valleys, in the cracks in the cliffs, on all the thornbushes, and at all the water holes.
ISA.7.20	 “On that day the Lord will hire the king of Assyria from beyond the Euphrates River to be a razor to shave the hair on your head, the hair on your legs, and even your beard. 
ISA.7.21	 On that day a person will keep alive a young cow and two sheep. 
ISA.7.22	 That person will eat cheese, because they will produce so much milk. Everyone who is left in the land will eat cheese and honey. 
ISA.7.23	 On that day, in every place where there were 1,000 vines (worth 1,000 pieces of silver), there will be briars and thorns. 
ISA.7.24	 People will come there with bows and arrows ⌊to hunt⌋ because the whole land will be filled with briars and thorns. 
ISA.7.25	 And you will no longer be able to go to all the hills which used to be cultivated because they will be filled with briars and thorns. It will be a place for turning oxen loose and letting sheep run.”
ISA.8.1	 The L
ISA.8.2	 I will have these dependable witnesses testify: the priest Uriah and Zechariah (son of Jeberechiah).”
ISA.8.3	 I slept with the prophet. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. The L
ISA.8.4	 Before the boy knows how to say ‘Daddy’ or ‘Mommy,’ the wealth of Damascus and the loot from Samaria will be carried away to th e king of Assyria.”
ISA.8.5	 The L
ISA.8.6	 “These people have rejected the gently flowing water of Shiloah
ISA.8.6	and find joy in Rezin and Remaliah’s son.”
ISA.8.7	 That is why the Lord is going to bring against them
ISA.8.7	the raging and powerful floodwaters of the Euphrates River—
ISA.8.7	the king of Assyria with all his power.
ISA.8.7	It will overflow all its channels and go over all its banks.
ISA.8.8	 It will sweep through Judah.
ISA.8.8	It will overflow and pass through; it will be neck-high.
ISA.8.8	Its outspread wings will extend over your whole country, O Immanuel.
ISA.8.9	 Be broken, you people. Be terrified.
ISA.8.9	Listen, all you distant parts of the earth.
ISA.8.9	Prepare for battle, but be terrified.
ISA.8.9	Prepare for battle, but be terrified.
ISA.8.10	 Make plans for battle, but they will never succeed.
ISA.8.10	Give orders, but they won’t be carried out,
ISA.8.10	because God is with us!
ISA.8.11	 This is what the L
ISA.8.11	He warned me not to follow the ways of these people:
ISA.8.12	 “Don’t say that everything these people call a conspiracy
ISA.8.12	is a conspiracy.
ISA.8.12	Don’t fear what they fear.
ISA.8.12	Don’t let it terrify you.”
ISA.8.13	 Remember that the L
ISA.8.13	He is the one you should fear
ISA.8.13	and the one you should be terrified of.
ISA.8.14	 He will be a place of safety for you.
ISA.8.14	But he will be a rock that makes people trip
ISA.8.14	and a stumbling block for both kingdoms of Israel.
ISA.8.14	He will be a trap and a snare for those who live in Jerusalem.
ISA.8.15	 Many will stumble.
ISA.8.15	They will fall and be broken.
ISA.8.15	They will be trapped and caught.
ISA.8.16	 Tie up the written instructions.
ISA.8.16	Seal the teachings among my disciples.
ISA.8.17	 I will wait for the 
ISA.8.17	who hides his face from the descendants of Jacob.
ISA.8.17	I will hope in him.
ISA.8.18	 I am here with the children that the 
ISA.8.18	We are signs and symbols in Israel
ISA.8.18	from the 
ISA.8.19	 People will say to you, “Ask for help from the mediums
ISA.8.19	and the fortunetellers, who whisper and mutter.”
ISA.8.19	Shouldn’t people ask their God for help instead?
ISA.8.19	Why should they ask the dead to help the living?
ISA.8.20	 They should go to the teachings and to the written instructions.
ISA.8.20	If people don’t speak these words,
ISA.8.20	it is because it doesn’t dawn on them.
ISA.8.21	 They will pass through the land when they are hard-pressed and hungry.
ISA.8.21	When they are hungry, they will be furious.
ISA.8.21	Then they will look up, cursing their king and God.
ISA.8.22	 They will look at the earth and see only distress and gloom.
ISA.8.22	They will go in anguish and be forced into darkness.
ISA.9.1	 But there will be no more gloom
ISA.9.1	for the land that is in distress.
ISA.9.1	God humbled the lands of Zebulun and Naphtali in earlier times.
ISA.9.1	But in the future he will bring glory to the road by the sea,
ISA.9.1	to the land across the Jordan River,
ISA.9.1	to Galilee, where foreigners live.
ISA.9.2	 The people who walk in darkness will see a bright light.
ISA.9.2	The light will shine on those who live in the land of death’s shadow.
ISA.9.3	 You will expand the nation and increase its happiness.
ISA.9.3	It will be happy in your presence
ISA.9.3	like those who celebrate the harvest
ISA.9.3	or rejoice when dividing loot.
ISA.9.4	 You will break the yoke 
ISA.9.4	the bar that is across their shoulders,
ISA.9.4	and the stick used by their oppressor,
ISA.9.4	as ⌊you did in the battle against⌋ Midian.
ISA.9.5	 Every warrior’s boot marching to the sound of battle
ISA.9.5	and every garment rolled in blood
ISA.9.5	will be burned as fuel in the fire.
ISA.9.6	 A child will be born for us.
ISA.9.6	A son will be given to us.
ISA.9.6	The government will rest on his shoulders.
ISA.9.6	He will be named:
ISA.9.6	Wonderful Counselor,
ISA.9.6	Mighty God,
ISA.9.6	Everlasting Father,
ISA.9.6	Prince of Peace.
ISA.9.7	 His government and peace will have unlimited growth.
ISA.9.7	He will establish David’s throne and kingdom.
ISA.9.7	He will uphold it with justice and righteousness now and forever.
ISA.9.7	The L
ISA.9.8	 The L
ISA.9.8	The message is against Israel.
ISA.9.9	 All the people of Ephraim
ISA.9.9	and the people who live in Samaria will know it.
ISA.9.9	With arrogant and conceited hearts they will say,
ISA.9.10	 “Bricks have fallen,
ISA.9.10	but we will rebuild with hand-cut stones.
ISA.9.10	Fig trees have been cut down,
ISA.9.10	but we will replace them with cedars.”
ISA.9.11	 The L
ISA.9.11	and will stir up its enemies—
ISA.9.12	 the Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west.
ISA.9.12	They will devour Israel with open mouths.
ISA.9.12	Even after all this, his anger will not disappear,
ISA.9.12	and he is still ready to use his power.
ISA.9.13	 But the people have not returned to the one who struck them,
ISA.9.13	nor have they sought the L
ISA.9.14	 So in one day the L
ISA.9.14	both head and tail,
ISA.9.14	both palm branches and cattails.
ISA.9.15	 Respected and honored leaders are the head.
ISA.9.15	Prophets who teach lies are the tail.
ISA.9.16	 Those who guide these people lead them astray.
ISA.9.16	Those who are guided by them will be destroyed.
ISA.9.17	 That is why the Lord isn’t happy with their young men,
ISA.9.17	nor will he show compassion for their orphans and widows.
ISA.9.17	Every one of them is a godless evildoer,
ISA.9.17	and every mouth speaks foolishness.
ISA.9.17	Even after all this, his anger will not disappear,
ISA.9.17	and he is still ready to use his power.
ISA.9.18	 Surely wickedness burns like fire.
ISA.9.18	It burns up briars and thorns.
ISA.9.18	It sets the underbrush in the forest on fire,
ISA.9.18	and it whirls upward in clouds of smoke.
ISA.9.19	 The land is scorched by the fury of the L
ISA.9.19	and the people are like fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.19	No one shows concern for others:
ISA.9.20	 On the right, one gobbles up food and is still hungry.
ISA.9.20	On the left, another eats and is never full.
ISA.9.20	Each person eats the flesh from his own arm.
ISA.9.21	 Manasseh is against Ephraim.
ISA.9.21	Ephraim is against Manasseh.
ISA.9.21	Together they attack Judah.
ISA.9.21	Even after all this, his anger will not disappear,
ISA.9.21	and he is still ready to use his power.
ISA.10.1	 How horrible it will be for those who make unjust laws
ISA.10.1	and who make oppressive regulations.
ISA.10.2	 They deprive the poor of justice.
ISA.10.2	They take away the rights of the needy among my people.
ISA.10.2	They prey on widows and rob orphans.
ISA.10.3	 What will you do on the day
ISA.10.3	you are called to account ⌊for these things⌋,
ISA.10.3	when the disaster comes from far away?
ISA.10.3	Where will you run for help?
ISA.10.3	Where will you leave your wealth?
ISA.10.4	 Nothing’s left but to crouch among prisoners
ISA.10.4	and to fall with those who are killed.
ISA.10.4	Even after all this, his anger will not disappear,
ISA.10.4	and he is still ready to use his power.
ISA.10.5	 “How horrible it will be for Assyria!
ISA.10.5	It is the rod of my anger.
ISA.10.5	My fury is the staff in the Assyrians’ hands.
ISA.10.6	 I send them against a godless nation.
ISA.10.6	In my fury I order them against the people
ISA.10.6	to take their belongings, loot them,
ISA.10.6	and trample on them like mud in the streets.
ISA.10.7	 But that’s not what they intend to do.
ISA.10.7	Their minds don’t work that way.
ISA.10.7	Their purpose is to destroy and put an end to many nations.
ISA.10.8	 They ask, ‘Aren’t all our commanders kings?
ISA.10.9	 Isn’t Calno like Carchemish?
ISA.10.9	Isn’t Hamath like Arpad?
ISA.10.9	Isn’t Samaria like Damascus?’
ISA.10.10	 My power has reached kingdoms which have idols.
ISA.10.10	They had more carved statues than Jerusalem or Samaria.
ISA.10.11	 I will do to Jerusalem and its idols
ISA.10.11	what I’ve done to Samaria and its idols.”
ISA.10.12	 When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he will punish the king of Assyria for all his boasting and all his arrogance. 
ISA.10.13	 The king will say,
ISA.10.13	“I did this with my own two powerful hands.
ISA.10.13	I did this with my wisdom, because I am so clever.
ISA.10.13	I’ve eliminated the boundaries of nations.
ISA.10.13	I’ve looted treasuries.
ISA.10.13	I’ve brought down people like a mighty man.
ISA.10.14	 I’ve found the riches of nations as one finds a nest.
ISA.10.14	I’ve gathered the whole world as one gathers abandoned eggs.
ISA.10.14	Not one of them flapped a wing, opened its mouth, or peeped.”
ISA.10.15	 Can an ax attack the person who cuts with it?
ISA.10.15	Can a saw make itself greater than the person who saws with it?
ISA.10.15	A rod cannot move the person who lifts it.
ISA.10.15	A wooden stick cannot pick up a person.
ISA.10.16	 That is why the Almighty L
ISA.10.16	will send a degenerative disease against brave men.
ISA.10.16	A flame will be turned into a raging fire under his power.
ISA.10.17	 Israel’s light will become a flame.
ISA.10.17	Its Holy One will become a fire.
ISA.10.17	He will burn up and devour the weeds and thornbushes in one day.
ISA.10.18	 The majestic forest and the orchard
ISA.10.18	will destroy both body and soul.
ISA.10.18	They will be like a sick person wasting away.
ISA.10.19	 The trees that remain in the forest will be so few that
ISA.10.19	a child could count them.
ISA.10.20	 At that time the remaining few Israelites,
ISA.10.20	the survivors of Jacob’s descendants
ISA.10.20	will no longer depend on the one who struck them.
ISA.10.20	They will only depend on the L
ISA.10.21	 A few, the remaining few of Jacob, will return to the mighty God.
ISA.10.22	 Although your people Israel may be
ISA.10.22	as ⌊numerous as⌋ the grains of sand on the seashore,
ISA.10.22	only a few will return.
ISA.10.22	Destruction will be complete and fair.
ISA.10.23	 The Almighty L
ISA.10.23	throughout the world as he has determined.
ISA.10.24	 The Almighty L
ISA.10.24	My people who live in Zion,
ISA.10.24	don’t be afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with a rod
ISA.10.24	or when they raise their staff against you
ISA.10.24	as the Egyptians did.
ISA.10.25	 Very soon I will unleash my fury,
ISA.10.25	and my anger will destroy them.
ISA.10.26	 Then the L
ISA.10.26	As he struck down Midian at the Rock of Oreb
ISA.10.26	and raised his staff over the water,
ISA.10.26	so he will lift it as he did in Egypt.
ISA.10.27	 At that time their burden will be removed from your shoulders.
ISA.10.27	Their yoke 
ISA.10.27	The yoke will be torn away because you have grown fat.
ISA.10.28	 They come to Aiath.
ISA.10.28	They pass through Migron.
ISA.10.28	They store their equipment at Michmash.
ISA.10.29	 They go through the mountain pass and lodge at Geba for the night.
ISA.10.29	The people in Ramah tremble; the people in Saul’s Gibeah flee.
ISA.10.30	 Cry aloud, you people in Gallim!
ISA.10.30	Pay attention, you people in Laishah and miserable Anathoth!
ISA.10.31	 The people in Madmenah flee; those who live in Gebim take shelter.
ISA.10.32	 This day they stopped at Nob.
ISA.10.32	They shake their fist at the mountain of my people Zion,
ISA.10.32	at the mountain of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	 Now look! The Almighty L
ISA.10.33	will trim the branches with terrifying power.
ISA.10.33	The highest trees will be cut down.
ISA.10.33	The tallest ones will be brought down.
ISA.10.34	 He will cut down the underbrush of the forest with an ax.
ISA.10.34	Lebanon will fall in front of the Mighty One.
ISA.11.1	 Then a shoot will come out from the stump of Jesse,
ISA.11.1	and a branch from its roots will bear fruit.
ISA.11.2	 The Spirit of the L
ISA.11.2	the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
ISA.11.2	the Spirit of advice and power,
ISA.11.2	the Spirit of knowledge and fear of the L
ISA.11.3	 He will gladly bear the fear of the L
ISA.11.3	He will not judge by what his eyes see
ISA.11.3	or decide by what his ears hear.
ISA.11.4	 He will judge the poor justly.
ISA.11.4	He will make fair decisions for the humble people on earth.
ISA.11.4	He will strike the earth with a rod from his mouth.
ISA.11.4	He will kill the wicked with the breath from his lips.
ISA.11.5	 Justice will be the belt around his waist.
ISA.11.5	Faithfulness will be the belt around his hips.
ISA.11.6	 Wolves will live with lambs.
ISA.11.6	Leopards will lie down with goats.
ISA.11.6	Calves, young lions, and year-old lambs will be together,
ISA.11.6	and little children will lead them.
ISA.11.7	 Cows and bears will eat together.
ISA.11.7	Their young will lie down together.
ISA.11.7	Lions will eat straw like oxen.
ISA.11.8	 Infants will play near cobras’ holes.
ISA.11.8	Toddlers will put their hands into vipers’ nests.
ISA.11.9	 They will not hurt or destroy anyone anywhere on my holy mountain.
ISA.11.9	The world will be filled with the knowledge of the L
ISA.11.9	like water covering the sea.
ISA.11.10	 At that time the root of Jesse will stand as a banner
ISA.11.10	for the people ⌊to gather around⌋.
ISA.11.10	The nations will come to him.
ISA.11.10	His resting place will be glorious.
ISA.11.11	 At that time the Lord will use his power again
ISA.11.11	to recover what remains of his people
ISA.11.11	in Assyria, Upper and Lower Egypt,
ISA.11.11	Sudan, Elam, Babylonia, Hamath,
ISA.11.11	and the islands of the sea.
ISA.11.12	 He will raise a banner for the nations ⌊to gather around⌋.
ISA.11.12	He will gather the outcasts of Israel
ISA.11.12	and bring together the scattered people of Judah
ISA.11.12	from the four corners of the earth.
ISA.11.13	 Ephraim’s jealousy will vanish,
ISA.11.13	and Judah’s opponents will come to an end.
ISA.11.13	Ephraim won’t be jealous of Judah,
ISA.11.13	and Judah won’t oppose Ephraim.
ISA.11.14	 They will swoop down on the slopes of Philistia in the west.
ISA.11.14	Together they will loot the people of the east.
ISA.11.14	They will conquer Edom and Moab.
ISA.11.14	The people of Ammon will be subject to them.
ISA.11.15	 The L
ISA.11.15	He will wave his hand over the Euphrates River with his scorching wind
ISA.11.15	and divide it into seven streams
ISA.11.15	so that people can walk over it in their sandals.
ISA.11.16	 There will be a highway
ISA.11.16	for the remaining few of his people left in Assyria
ISA.11.16	like there was for Israel when it came out of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	 At that time you will say,
ISA.12.1	“I will praise you, O L
ISA.12.1	Although you had been angry with me,
ISA.12.1	you turned your anger away from me, and you comforted me.
ISA.12.2	 Look! God is my Savior.
ISA.12.2	I am confident and unafraid,
ISA.12.2	because the L
ISA.12.2	He is my Savior.”
ISA.12.3	 With joy you will draw water from the springs of salvation.
ISA.12.4	 At that time you will say,
ISA.12.4	“Praise the L
ISA.12.4	Call on his name.
ISA.12.4	Make his deeds known among the nations.
ISA.12.4	Make them remember that his name is highly honored.
ISA.12.5	 Make music to praise the L
ISA.12.5	He has done wonderful things.
ISA.12.5	Let this be known throughout the earth.
ISA.12.6	 Shout loudly, and sing with joy, people of Zion!
ISA.12.6	The Holy One of Israel is great. He is among you.”
ISA.13.1	 This is the divine revelation which Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw about Babylon.
ISA.13.2	 Raise a banner on the bare mountaintop.
ISA.13.2	Call loudly to them.
ISA.13.2	Signal them with your hand to enter the nobles’ gates.
ISA.13.3	 I’ve commanded my holy ones.
ISA.13.3	I’ve called my mighty men to carry out my anger.
ISA.13.3	They find joy in my triumphs.
ISA.13.4	 Listen to the noise on the mountains.
ISA.13.4	It is like the sound of a large army.
ISA.13.4	It is the sound of kingdoms and nations gathering together.
ISA.13.4	The L
ISA.13.5	 His army is coming from a distant land,
ISA.13.5	from the ends of heaven.
ISA.13.5	The L
ISA.13.5	to destroy the whole world.
ISA.13.6	 Cry loudly, for the day of the L
ISA.13.6	It will come like destruction from the Almighty.
ISA.13.7	 That is why every hand will hang limp,
ISA.13.7	and everyone’s courage will fail.
ISA.13.8	 They’ll be terrified.
ISA.13.8	Pain and anguish will seize them.
ISA.13.8	They’ll writhe like a woman giving birth to a child.
ISA.13.8	They’ll look at one another in astonishment.
ISA.13.8	Their faces will be burning red.
ISA.13.9	 The day of the L
ISA.13.9	It will be a cruel day with fury and fierce anger.
ISA.13.9	He will make the earth desolate.
ISA.13.9	He will destroy its sinners.
ISA.13.10	 The stars in the sky and their constellations
ISA.13.10	won’t show their light anymore.
ISA.13.10	The sun will be dark when it rises.
ISA.13.10	The moon won’t shine.
ISA.13.11	 I will punish the world for its evil
ISA.13.11	and the wicked for their wrongdoing.
ISA.13.11	I will put an end to arrogant people
ISA.13.11	and humble the pride of tyrants.
ISA.13.12	 I will make people harder to find than pure gold
ISA.13.12	and human beings more rare than gold from Ophir.
ISA.13.13	 I will make heaven tremble,
ISA.13.13	and the earth will be shaken from its place
ISA.13.13	when the L
ISA.13.13	At that time he will be very angry.
ISA.13.14	 They’ll be like hunted gazelle
ISA.13.14	and like sheep with no one to gather them.
ISA.13.14	Everyone will return to his own people
ISA.13.14	and flee to his own land.
ISA.13.15	 Whoever is found will be stabbed to death.
ISA.13.15	Whoever is captured will be executed.
ISA.13.16	 Their little children will be smashed to death right before their eyes.
ISA.13.16	Their houses will be looted and their wives raped.
ISA.13.17	 I’m going to stir up the Medes against them.
ISA.13.17	They don’t care for silver and aren’t happy with gold.
ISA.13.18	 But their bows will smash the youth.
ISA.13.18	They’ll have no compassion for babies,
ISA.13.18	nor will they look with pity on children.
ISA.13.19	 Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms,
ISA.13.19	the proud beauty of the Chaldeans,
ISA.13.19	will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God destroyed them.
ISA.13.20	 It will never be inhabited again,
ISA.13.20	and no one will live in it for generations.
ISA.13.20	Arabs won’t pitch their tents there.
ISA.13.20	Shepherds won’t let their flocks rest there.
ISA.13.21	 Desert animals will lie down there.
ISA.13.21	Their homes will be full of owls.
ISA.13.21	Ostriches will live there,
ISA.13.21	and wild goats will skip about.
ISA.13.22	 Hyenas will howl in Babylon’s strongholds,
ISA.13.22	and jackals will howl in its luxurious palaces.
ISA.13.22	Its time has almost come.
ISA.13.22	Its days will not be extended.
ISA.14.1	 The L
ISA.14.1	He will resettle them in their own country.
ISA.14.1	Foreigners will join them
ISA.14.1	and unite with the descendants of Jacob.
ISA.14.2	 People will take them
ISA.14.2	and bring them to their own place.
ISA.14.2	The nation of Israel will possess nations
ISA.14.2	as male and female slaves in the L
ISA.14.2	They will take their captors captive
ISA.14.2	and rule their oppressors.
ISA.14.3	 When that day comes, the L
ISA.14.3	from your pain and suffering,
ISA.14.3	from the hard slavery you were forced to do.
ISA.14.4	 Then you will mock the king of Babylon with this saying,
ISA.14.4	“How the tyrant has come to an end!
ISA.14.4	How his attacks have come to an end!”
ISA.14.5	 The L

ISA.14.6	 They struck the people with fury,
ISA.14.6	with blows that didn’t stop.
ISA.14.6	They ruled nations in anger,
ISA.14.6	persecuting them without restraint.
ISA.14.7	 The whole earth rests and is peaceful.
ISA.14.7	It breaks out into shouts of joy.
ISA.14.8	 Even the cypresses rejoice over you.
ISA.14.8	The cedars of Lebanon say,
ISA.14.8	“Since you have fallen,
ISA.14.8	no lumberjack has come to attack us.”
ISA.14.9	 Sheol below wakes up to meet you when you come.
ISA.14.9	It wakes up the ghosts of the dead,
ISA.14.9	all who were leaders on earth.
ISA.14.9	It raises all who were kings of the nations from their thrones.
ISA.14.10	 All of them will greet you,
ISA.14.10	“You also have become weak like us!
ISA.14.10	You have become like one of us!”
ISA.14.11	 Your pride has been brought down to Sheol
ISA.14.11	along with the music of your harps.
ISA.14.11	Maggots are spread out ⌊like a bed⌋ under you,
ISA.14.11	and worms cover you.
ISA.14.12	 How you have fallen from heaven, you morning star, son of the dawn!
ISA.14.12	How you have been cut down to the ground, you conqueror of nations!
ISA.14.13	 You thought,
ISA.14.13	“I’ll go up to heaven and set up my throne above God’s stars.
ISA.14.13	I’ll sit on the mountain far away in the north
ISA.14.13	where the gods assemble.
ISA.14.14	 I’ll go above the top of the clouds.
ISA.14.14	I’ll be like the Most High.”
ISA.14.15	 But you’ve been brought down to Sheol,
ISA.14.15	to the deepest part of the pit.
ISA.14.16	 Those who see you stare at you; they look at you closely and say,
ISA.14.16	“Is this the man who made the earth tremble,
ISA.14.16	who shook the kingdoms,
ISA.14.17	 who made the world like a desert and tore down its cities,
ISA.14.17	who didn’t let his prisoners go home?”
ISA.14.18	 All the kings of the nations, all of them,
ISA.14.18	have been buried with honor, each in his own tomb.
ISA.14.19	 But you are thrown out of your tomb like a rejected branch.
ISA.14.19	You are covered with those who were killed in battle.
ISA.14.19	You go down to the stones of the pit like a trampled corpse.
ISA.14.20	 You won’t be joined by the kings in the tomb,
ISA.14.20	because you have destroyed your land and killed your people.
ISA.14.20	The descendants of the wicked will never be mentioned again.
ISA.14.21	 Prepare a place to slaughter their sons
ISA.14.21	because of their ancestors’ guilt.
ISA.14.21	They won’t be able to rise, possess the earth,
ISA.14.21	and rebuild cities all over it.
ISA.14.22	 “I’ll rise up against them,” declares the L
ISA.14.22	“I’ll cut off the name of the survivors from Babylon,
ISA.14.22	its offspring and descendants,” declares the L
ISA.14.23	 “It will become the possession of herons.
ISA.14.23	It will become pools of water.

ISA.14.25	Then its yoke 
ISA.14.25	and its burden will be removed from their shoulders.”
ISA.14.26	 This is the plan determined for the whole earth.
ISA.14.26	This is how he will use his power against all the nations.
ISA.14.27	 The L
ISA.14.27	He is ready to use his power. Who can turn it back?
ISA.14.28	 This was the divine revelation in the year King Ahaz died.
ISA.14.29	 All you Philistines, don’t rejoice
ISA.14.29	that the rod of the one who struck you is broken,
ISA.14.29	because a viper will come from that snake’s root,
ISA.14.29	and his descendant will be a flying, fiery serpent.
ISA.14.30	 The poorest of the poor will eat,
ISA.14.30	and the needy will lie down in safety.
ISA.14.30	But I will put your root to death with famine
ISA.14.30	and kill off your survivors.
ISA.14.31	 Cry loudly in the gate!
ISA.14.31	Cry out in the city!
ISA.14.31	Be frightened, all you Philistines!
ISA.14.31	Smoke comes from the north,
ISA.14.31	and there are no stragglers in its ranks.
ISA.14.32	 How should we answer the messengers from the nations?
ISA.14.32	⌊Tell them that⌋ the L
ISA.14.32	and his humble people will find refuge in it.
ISA.15.1	 This is the divine revelation about Moab.
ISA.15.1	In a single night Ar in Moab is laid waste and destroyed!
ISA.15.1	In a single night Kir in Moab is laid waste and destroyed!
ISA.15.2	 The people of Dibon go to the temple,
ISA.15.2	to the worship sites, to cry.
ISA.15.2	Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba.
ISA.15.2	Every head is shaved bald, and every beard is cut off.
ISA.15.3	 In their streets they wear sackcloth.
ISA.15.3	On their roofs and in their city squares everyone wails and cries.
ISA.15.4	 Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out.
ISA.15.4	Their voices are heard as far away as Jahaz.
ISA.15.4	Moab’s armed men cry out.
ISA.15.4	Their courage is gone.
ISA.15.5	 My heart cries out for Moab.
ISA.15.5	Its people flee as far as Zoar at Eglath Shelishiyah.
ISA.15.5	They go up the mountain road to Luhith.
ISA.15.5	They cry loudly over the destruction on the way to Horonaim.
ISA.15.6	 The Nimrim Brook has run dry!
ISA.15.6	The grass dries up,
ISA.15.6	the vegetation withers,
ISA.15.6	and nothing green is left.
ISA.15.7	 That is why they carry the wealth that they have earned and stored up
ISA.15.7	over Willow Ravine.
ISA.15.8	 Cries for help echo throughout the land of Moab.
ISA.15.8	Their wailing echoes as far as Eglaim.
ISA.15.8	Their wailing echoes as far as Beer Elim.
ISA.15.9	 The water in Dimon is red with blood,
ISA.15.9	yet I will bring even more on Dimon.
ISA.15.9	A lion will attack the fugitives from Moab
ISA.15.9	and the survivors from Adamah.
ISA.16.1	 Send lambs to the ruler of the land.
ISA.16.1	Send lambs from Sela through the desert to my people at Mount Zion.
ISA.16.2	 Moab’s daughters are like fluttering birds,
ISA.16.2	like scattered nestlings,
ISA.16.2	at the shallow crossings of the Arnon River.
ISA.16.3	 Give us advice.
ISA.16.3	Make a decision.
ISA.16.3	At high noon make your shadow as dark as night.
ISA.16.3	Hide the fugitives.
ISA.16.3	Don’t betray the refugees.
ISA.16.4	 Let the fugitives from Moab stay with you a while.
ISA.16.4	Be their refuge from the destroyer.
ISA.16.4	Ruthless people will come to an end.
ISA.16.4	The destruction will end.
ISA.16.4	The one who tramples others will be gone.
ISA.16.5	 Then the L
ISA.16.5	He will rule faithfully.
ISA.16.5	He is from the tent of David.
ISA.16.5	He judges and searches for justice.
ISA.16.5	He is quick to do what is right.
ISA.16.6	 We’ve heard of the arrogance of Moab’s people.
ISA.16.6	They are very arrogant.
ISA.16.6	We’ve heard of their boasting, arrogance, and conceit,
ISA.16.6	but their boasts aren’t true.
ISA.16.7	 That is why Moab will wail.
ISA.16.7	Everyone will wail for Moab.
ISA.16.7	Mourn and grieve over the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth.
ISA.16.8	 The fields of Heshbon and the vineyards of Sibmah wither.
ISA.16.8	Rulers of the nations have cut off their grapes.
ISA.16.8	The grapevines ⌊once⌋ reached as far as Jazer
ISA.16.8	and strayed out into the desert.
ISA.16.8	Their shoots had spread out over the sea.
ISA.16.9	 I will cry for the grapevines of Sibmah
ISA.16.9	as Jazer cries for them.
ISA.16.9	I will drench you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh.
ISA.16.9	The shouts of joy for your ripened fruits
ISA.16.9	and your harvest will be silenced.
ISA.16.10	 Joy and delight have vanished from the orchards.
ISA.16.10	No songs are sung.
ISA.16.10	No shouts are raised.
ISA.16.10	No one stomps on grapes in the winepresses,
ISA.16.10	because I have put an end to the shouts of joy.
ISA.16.11	 That is why my heart mourns for Moab like a harp.
ISA.16.11	My soul mourns for Kir Hareseth.
ISA.16.12	 When the people of Moab appear at the worship site,
ISA.16.12	they will only wear themselves out.
ISA.16.12	They will come into the holy place to pray,
ISA.16.12	but they won’t be able to.
ISA.16.13	 This is the message that the L
ISA.16.14	 But now the L
ISA.17.1	 This is the divine revelation about Damascus.
ISA.17.1	“Damascus will no longer be a city.
ISA.17.1	It will become a pile of rubble.
ISA.17.2	 The cities of Aroer will be deserted.
ISA.17.2	These cities will be used for sheep, which will lie down in them.
ISA.17.2	There will be no one to disturb those sheep.
ISA.17.3	 Fortified cities will disappear from Ephraim,
ISA.17.3	and the kingdom will disappear from Damascus.
ISA.17.3	The remaining few from Aram will share Israel’s honor,”
ISA.17.3	declares the L
ISA.17.4	 “When that day comes, the honor of Jacob’s people will fade away,
ISA.17.4	and they will become skin and bones.
ISA.17.5	 That time will be like harvesting bundles of grain by the armful.
ISA.17.5	It will be like gathering grain in the Rephaim Valley.
ISA.17.6	 Only a few people will survive.
ISA.17.6	They will be like an olive tree that has been beaten.
ISA.17.6	Only two or three olives are left
ISA.17.6	at the top of the highest branch,
ISA.17.6	four or five olives on the rest of the branches,”
ISA.17.6	declares the L
ISA.17.7	 When that day comes, they will look to their maker,
ISA.17.7	and their eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.17.8	 They won’t look to the altars made by their hands
ISA.17.8	or to the Asherah poles or incense altars
ISA.17.8	which their fingers molded.
ISA.17.9	 When that day comes, the fortified cities
ISA.17.9	which other people abandoned because of the Israelites
ISA.17.9	will be like abandoned woods and undergrowth.
ISA.17.9	So it will become a wasteland.
ISA.17.10	 You have forgotten the God of your salvation.
ISA.17.10	You haven’t remembered the rock, your stronghold.
ISA.17.10	Instead, you have planted the best plants
ISA.17.10	and have set out the imported grapevines.
ISA.17.11	 On the day you plant, you will make it grow.
ISA.17.11	On the morning you set out the seedling, you will make it sprout.
ISA.17.11	But the harvest will become a [rotting] pile 
ISA.17.11	on a day of grief and incurable pain.
ISA.17.12	 How horrible it will be for many people!
ISA.17.12	They will roar like the roaring sea.
ISA.17.12	The noise that the people make
ISA.17.12	will be like the noise from rushing water.
ISA.17.13	 The people will make noise like raging water.
ISA.17.13	But the L
ISA.17.13	They will be chased away
ISA.17.13	like husks on the mountains being blown by the wind,
ISA.17.13	like whirling dust being blown by a storm.
ISA.17.14	 In the evening there will be sudden terror.
ISA.17.14	Before morning they will be gone.
ISA.17.14	This will be the fate of those who looted us,
ISA.17.14	the destiny of those who robbed us.
ISA.18.1	 How horrible it will be for the land of whirring wings
ISA.18.1	which lies beyond the rivers of Sudan.
ISA.18.2	 It sends messengers by sea
ISA.18.2	in boats made of reeds
ISA.18.2	⌊skimming⌋ over the surface of the water.
ISA.18.2	Go, swift messengers, to a tall and smooth-skinned people,
ISA.18.2	a people ⌊who are⌋ feared far and near,
ISA.18.2	a strong and aggressive nation,
ISA.18.2	whose land is divided by rivers.
ISA.18.3	 Look when someone raises a flag on the mountains.
ISA.18.3	Listen when someone blows a ram’s horn,
ISA.18.3	all you inhabitants of the world who live on the earth.
ISA.18.4	 This is what the L
ISA.18.4	I will keep quiet and watch from my dwelling place.
ISA.18.4	My presence will be like scorching heat in the sunshine,
ISA.18.4	like heavy dew in the heat of the harvest.
ISA.18.5	 Before the harvest, when blossoms are gone
ISA.18.5	and grapes are ripening from blossoms,
ISA.18.5	he will cut off the shoots with pruning shears
ISA.18.5	and chop off the spreading branches.
ISA.18.6	 They will be left for the birds of prey on the mountains
ISA.18.6	and the wild animals.
ISA.18.6	The birds of prey will feed on them in the summer,
ISA.18.6	and all the wild animals on earth
ISA.18.6	will feed on them in the winter.
ISA.18.7	 At that time gifts will be brought to the L
ISA.18.7	from a tall and smooth-skinned people,
ISA.18.7	a people ⌊who are⌋ feared far and near,
ISA.18.7	a strong and aggressive nation,
ISA.18.7	whose land is divided by rivers.

ISA.19.3	 The Egyptians will lose courage.
ISA.19.3	I will unravel their plans.
ISA.19.3	They will turn to idols, ghosts,
ISA.19.3	mediums, and fortunetellers.
ISA.19.4	 I will hand over the Egyptians to a harsh master.
ISA.19.4	A strong king will rule them,”
ISA.19.4	declares the Almighty L
ISA.19.5	 The water in the Nile River will be dried up,
ISA.19.5	and the river will be dry and empty.
ISA.19.6	 The canals will stink.
ISA.19.6	Egypt’s streams will be emptied and dried up.
ISA.19.6	The reeds and cattails will wither.
ISA.19.7	 The rushes by the Nile, by the edge of the Nile,
ISA.19.7	and all the fields planted beside the Nile
ISA.19.7	will dry up, be blown away, and disappear.
ISA.19.8	 Fishermen will cry.
ISA.19.8	All who cast their lines into the Nile will mourn.
ISA.19.8	Those who spread their nets on the water will sigh.
ISA.19.9	 Linenworkers and weavers will be ashamed.
ISA.19.10	 Egypt’s weavers will be crushed.
ISA.19.10	Those who work for money will be distressed.
ISA.19.11	 The leaders of Zoan are nothing but fools.
ISA.19.11	The wisest of Pharaoh’s counselors gives stupid advice.
ISA.19.11	How can you tell Pharaoh,
ISA.19.11	“I’m a descendant of wise men,
ISA.19.11	a descendant of ancient kings”?
ISA.19.12	 Where are your wise men now?
ISA.19.12	Let them tell you.
ISA.19.12	Let them explain what the L
ISA.19.12	is planning against Egypt.
ISA.19.13	 The leaders of Zoan are acting foolishly.
ISA.19.13	The leaders of Memphis are led astray.
ISA.19.13	The leaders who are the cornerstones of its tribes mislead the Egyptians.
ISA.19.14	 The L
ISA.19.14	So they lead the Egyptians astray
ISA.19.14	like a drunk who staggers in his vomit.
ISA.19.15	 No one—leaders or followers, important or unimportant—
ISA.19.15	can do anything for Egypt.
ISA.19.16	 At that time Egyptians will act like women. They will tremble and be terrified because the L
ISA.19.17	 The land of Judah will terrify the Egyptians. Whenever they are reminded of Judah, they will be terrified of it because of what the L
ISA.19.18	 When that day comes, five cities in Egypt will have people that speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the L

ISA.19.23	 When that day comes, a highway will run from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will come to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians. 
ISA.19.24	 When that day comes, Israel will be one-third ⌊of God’s people⌋, along with Egypt and Assyria. They will be a blessing on the earth. 
ISA.19.25	 The L
ISA.20.1	 In the year when King Sargon of Assyria sent his commander-in-chief to fight against Ashdod, he captured it. 
ISA.20.2	 At that time the L
ISA.20.3	 Then the L
ISA.20.4	 The king of Assyria will lead away both the young and the old—captives from Egypt and exiles from Sudan. They will be barefoot and naked. Their buttocks will be exposed in order to disgrace Egypt. 
ISA.20.5	 Then the people will be shattered and ashamed because Sudan was their hope and Egypt was their beauty. 
ISA.20.6	 When that day comes, those who live on this coastland will say, ‘Look at what has happened to our hope. We ran ⌊to Egypt⌋ for help to be rescued from the king of Assyria. How can we escape?’ ”
ISA.21.1	 This is the divine revelation about the desert by the sea.
ISA.21.1	Like a storm sweeping through the Negev,
ISA.21.1	an invader will come from the desert,
ISA.21.1	from a terrifying land.
ISA.21.2	 I was shown a harsh vision.

ISA.21.2	The destroyer destroys.
ISA.21.2	Go to war, Elam!
ISA.21.2	Surround them, Media!
ISA.21.2	I will put an end to all the groaning.
ISA.21.3	 That is why my body is full of trembling.
ISA.21.3	Pain grips me like the pain of childbirth.
ISA.21.3	I’m disturbed by what I hear.
ISA.21.3	I’m terrified by what I see.
ISA.21.4	 I’m confused.
ISA.21.4	I’m shaking with terror.
ISA.21.4	The twilight hours I longed for make me tremble.
ISA.21.5	 Set the table.
ISA.21.5	Spread the rugs ⌊by the table⌋.
ISA.21.5	Eat. Drink.
ISA.21.5	Get up, you leaders!
ISA.21.5	Prepare your shields for battle!
ISA.21.6	 This is what the Lord says to me:
ISA.21.6	Post a watchman.
ISA.21.6	Have him report whatever he sees.
ISA.21.7	 He will see chariots, pairs of horsemen,
ISA.21.7	riders on donkeys, and riders on camels.
ISA.21.7	Let him watch carefully, very carefully.
ISA.21.8	 The watchman 
ISA.21.8	“Sir, I stand on the watchtower every day.
ISA.21.8	Every night, I stand guard at my post.
ISA.21.9	 Look! Here come chariots and horsemen in pairs.”
ISA.21.9	Then he said,
ISA.21.9	“Babylon has fallen! It has fallen!
ISA.21.9	All the idols they worship lie shattered on the ground.”
ISA.21.10	 You, my people, have been threshed and winnowed.
ISA.21.10	I make known to you what I heard from the L
ISA.21.10	the God of Israel.
ISA.21.11	 This is the divine revelation about Dumah.
ISA.21.11	Someone is calling to me from Seir,
ISA.21.11	“Watchman, how much of the night is left?
ISA.21.11	Watchman, how much of the night is left?”
ISA.21.12	 The watchman answers,
ISA.21.12	“Morning is coming, and night will come again.
ISA.21.12	If you need to ask, come back and ask.”
ISA.21.13	 This is the divine revelation about Arabia.
ISA.21.13	You caravan of travelers from the people of Dedan
ISA.21.13	will spend the night in the forest of Arabia.
ISA.21.14	 Bring water for the thirsty,

ISA.21.15	 They flee from swords,
ISA.21.15	from swords ready to kill,
ISA.21.15	from bows ready to shoot,
ISA.21.15	and from the thick of battle.
ISA.21.16	 This is what the Lord says to me: All of Kedar’s honor will be gone in another year. I will count it like workers count the years left on their contracts.
ISA.21.17	 The remaining number of archers, Kedar’s mighty archers, will be few. The L
ISA.22.1	 This is the divine revelation about the valley of Vision.
ISA.22.1	What’s the matter with you?
ISA.22.1	Why do all of you go up on the roofs?
ISA.22.2	 You are a city filled with shouting,
ISA.22.2	a town filled with noise and excitement.
ISA.22.2	Your people weren’t killed with swords.
ISA.22.2	Your dead didn’t die in battle.
ISA.22.3	 All your leaders fled together
ISA.22.3	and were captured without their bows and arrows.
ISA.22.3	All those who were found were taken prisoner
ISA.22.3	before any of them could get far away.
ISA.22.4	 That is why I say,
ISA.22.4	“Turn away from me
ISA.22.4	so that I can cry bitterly.
ISA.22.4	Don’t try to comfort me
ISA.22.4	because of the destruction brought on my people.”
ISA.22.5	 The Almighty L
ISA.22.5	It will be a day of confusion and trampling
ISA.22.5	in the valley of Vision,
ISA.22.5	⌊a day of⌋ tearing down walls and crying for help

ISA.22.6	 Elam takes its quiver of arrows,

ISA.22.6	Kir uncovers its shields.
ISA.22.7	 Then your fertile valleys will be filled with chariots,
ISA.22.7	and horsemen will stand ready in front of the gate.
ISA.22.8	 On that day the L
ISA.22.8	You will look for weapons in the House of the Forest.
ISA.22.9	 You will see how many places in David’s wall are broken.
ISA.22.9	You will store water in the Lower Pool.
ISA.22.10	 You will count the houses in Jerusalem.
ISA.22.10	You will tear down those houses in order to fortify the walls.
ISA.22.11	 You will build a reservoir between the two walls
ISA.22.11	to hold the water of the Old Pool.
ISA.22.11	You didn’t look to Jerusalem’s maker.
ISA.22.11	You didn’t see the one who formed it long ago.
ISA.22.12	 On that day the Almighty L
ISA.22.12	will call for crying and for mourning,
ISA.22.12	for shaving your heads and for wearing sackcloth.
ISA.22.13	 Instead, you will rejoice, celebrate,

ISA.22.18	There you will die.
ISA.22.18	There your splendid chariots will remain.
ISA.22.18	There you will become a disgrace to your master’s household.
ISA.22.19	 “I will remove you from your office
ISA.22.19	and do away with your position.
ISA.22.20	 When that day comes, I will call my servant Eliakim, son of Hilkiah.
ISA.22.21	 I will dress him in your linen robe
ISA.22.21	and fasten it with your belt.
ISA.22.21	I will give him your authority,
ISA.22.21	and he will be like a father to those who live in Jerusalem

ISA.22.22	 I will place the key of the house of David around his neck.
ISA.22.22	What he opens no one will shut.
ISA.22.22	What he shuts no one will open.
ISA.22.23	 I will fasten him firmly in place like a peg,
ISA.22.23	and he will be a source of honor for his father’s household.
ISA.22.24	 They will hang on him the whole weight of his father’s household,
ISA.22.24	descendants and offspring and all the little utensils,
ISA.22.24	from bowls to jars of every kind.”
ISA.22.25	 The L
ISA.22.25	“On that day the peg which I firmly fastened in place will be removed.
ISA.22.25	It will be cut off and will fall,
ISA.22.25	and everything hanging on it will be destroyed.”

ISA.23.1	 This is the divine revelation about Tyre.
ISA.23.1	Cry loudly, you ships of Tarshish!
ISA.23.1	Your port at Tyre is destroyed.
ISA.23.1	Word has come to the ships from Cyprus.
ISA.23.2	 Be silent, you inhabitants of the coastland, you merchants from Sidon.
ISA.23.2	Your messengers have crossed the sea.
ISA.23.3	 The grain of Shihor is on the Mediterranean.
ISA.23.3	The harvest of the Nile River is brought to Tyre.
ISA.23.3	Tyre became the marketplace for the nations.
ISA.23.4	 Be ashamed, Sidon, because the stronghold by the sea has spoken,
ISA.23.4	“I’ve never been in labor or given birth.
ISA.23.4	I’ve raised no sons.
ISA.23.4	I’ve brought up no daughters.”
ISA.23.5	 When the news reaches Egypt,
ISA.23.5	the Egyptians will shudder over the news about Tyre.
ISA.23.6	 Travel to Tarshish!
ISA.23.6	Cry loudly, you inhabitants of the seacoast!
ISA.23.7	 Is this your bustling city founded in the distant past?
ISA.23.7	Is this the city that sent its people to settle in distant lands?
ISA.23.8	 Who planned such a thing against Tyre, the city that produced kings?
ISA.23.8	Its merchants are princes.
ISA.23.8	Its traders are among the honored people of the world.
ISA.23.9	 The L
ISA.23.9	in order to dishonor all arrogant people
ISA.23.9	and to humiliate all the honored people of the world.
ISA.23.10	 Travel through your country like the Nile, people of Tarshish.
ISA.23.10	You no longer have a harbor.
ISA.23.11	 The L
ISA.23.11	He has commanded that Canaan’s fortifications be destroyed.
ISA.23.12	 He says, “You will no longer be joyful,
ISA.23.12	my dear abused people Sidon.”
ISA.23.12	Get up, and travel to Cyprus.
ISA.23.12	Even there you will find no rest.
ISA.23.13	 Look at the land of the Babylonians.
ISA.23.13	These people will be gone.
ISA.23.13	Assyria gave this land to the desert animals.
ISA.23.13	Assyria set up battle towers,
ISA.23.13	stripped palaces bare,
ISA.23.13	and turned these places into ruins.
ISA.23.14	 Cry loudly, you ships of Tarshish, because your fortress will be destroyed. 
ISA.23.15	 When that day comes, Tyre will be forgotten for 70 years, the lifetime of one king. At the end of the 70 years, Tyre will be like the prostitute in this song:
ISA.23.16	 “Take your lyre.
ISA.23.16	Go around in the city, you forgotten prostitute.
ISA.23.16	Make sweet music.
ISA.23.16	Sing many songs so that you’ll be remembered.”

ISA.24.2	buyers and sellers,
ISA.24.2	lenders and borrowers,
ISA.24.2	debtors and creditors.
ISA.24.3	 The earth will be completely laid waste and stripped
ISA.24.3	because the L
ISA.24.4	 The earth dries up and withers.
ISA.24.4	The world wastes away and withers.
ISA.24.4	The great leaders of the earth waste away.
ISA.24.5	 The earth is polluted by those who live on it
ISA.24.5	because they’ve disobeyed the L
ISA.24.5	violated his laws,
ISA.24.5	and rejected the everlasting promise.
ISA.24.6	 That is why a curse devours the earth,
ISA.24.6	and its people are punished for their guilt.
ISA.24.6	That is why those who live on the earth are burned up,
ISA.24.6	and only a few people are left.
ISA.24.7	 New wine dries up, and grapevines waste away.
ISA.24.7	All happy people groan.
ISA.24.8	 Joyful tambourine music stops.
ISA.24.8	Noisy celebrations cease.
ISA.24.8	Joyful harp music stops.
ISA.24.9	 People no longer drink wine when they sing.
ISA.24.9	Liquor tastes bad to its drinkers.
ISA.24.10	 The ruined city lies desolate.
ISA.24.10	The entrance to every house is barred shut.
ISA.24.11	 People in the streets call for wine.
ISA.24.11	All joy passes away,
ISA.24.11	and the earth’s happiness is banished.
ISA.24.12	 The city is left in ruins.
ISA.24.12	Its gate is battered to pieces.
ISA.24.13	 That is the way it will be on earth among the nations.
ISA.24.13	They will be like an olive tree which has been shaken
ISA.24.13	or like what’s left after the grape harvest.
ISA.24.14	 They raise their voices.
ISA.24.14	They shout for joy.
ISA.24.14	From the sea they sing joyfully about the L
ISA.24.15	 Honor the L
ISA.24.15	Honor the name of the L
ISA.24.16	 From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise
ISA.24.16	that honor the Righteous One.
ISA.24.16	But I kept saying,
ISA.24.16	“I’m wasting away! I’m wasting away!
ISA.24.16	How horrible it is for me!
ISA.24.16	Traitors continue to betray,
ISA.24.16	and their treachery grows worse and worse.”
ISA.24.17	 Disasters, pits, and traps
ISA.24.17	are in store for those who live on earth.
ISA.24.18	 Whoever flees from news of a disaster will fall into a pit.
ISA.24.18	Whoever climbs out of that pit will be caught in a trap.
ISA.24.18	The floodgates in the sky will be opened,
ISA.24.18	and the foundations of the earth will shake.
ISA.24.19	 The earth will be completely broken.
ISA.24.19	The earth will shake back and forth violently.
ISA.24.19	The earth will stagger.
ISA.24.20	 The earth will stumble like a drunk
ISA.24.20	and sway like a shack in the wind.
ISA.24.20	Its disobedience weighs heavy on it.
ISA.24.20	It will fall and not get up again.
ISA.24.21	 On that day the L
ISA.24.21	and earth’s kings on earth.
ISA.24.22	 They’ll be gathered like prisoners in a jail
ISA.24.22	and locked in prison.
ISA.24.22	After a long time they’ll be punished.
ISA.24.23	 The moon will be embarrassed.
ISA.24.23	The sun will be ashamed,
ISA.24.23	because the L
ISA.24.23	on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem.
ISA.24.23	He will be glorious
ISA.24.23	in the presence of his respected leaders.
ISA.25.1	 O L

ISA.25.1	You have done miraculous things.

ISA.25.1	in carrying out your plans from long ago.
ISA.25.2	 You have turned cities into ruins,
ISA.25.2	fortified cities into piles of rubble,
ISA.25.2	and foreigners’ palaces into cities that will never be rebuilt.
ISA.25.3	 That is why strong people will honor you,
ISA.25.3	and cities ruled by the world’s tyrants will fear you.
ISA.25.4	 You have been a refuge for the poor,
ISA.25.4	a refuge for the needy in their distress,
ISA.25.4	a shelter from the rain, and shade from the heat.
ISA.25.4	(A tyrant’s breath is like a rainstorm against a wall,
ISA.25.5	 like heat in a dry land.)
ISA.25.5	You calm the uproar of foreigners.
ISA.25.5	The song of tyrants is silenced
ISA.25.5	like heat that is ⌊reduced⌋ by the shadow of a cloud.
ISA.25.6	 On this mountain the L

ISA.25.6	with the best foods and the finest wines.
ISA.25.7	 On this mountain he will remove

ISA.25.8	The Almighty L

ISA.25.10	 The L

ISA.26.1	We have a strong city.

ISA.26.2	 Open the gates, and let the righteous nation come in,

ISA.27.10	 The fortified city is isolated.

ISA.28.16	Whoever believes ⌊in him⌋ will not worry.
ISA.28.17	 I will make justice a measuring line
ISA.28.17	and righteousness a plumb line.
ISA.28.17	Hail will sweep away your refuge of lies,
ISA.28.17	and floodwaters will wash away your hiding place.
ISA.28.18	 Your treaty with death will be wiped away.
ISA.28.18	Your agreement with the grave will not stand.
ISA.28.18	When the overwhelming disaster passes by,
ISA.28.18	you will be trampled by it.
ISA.28.19	 Each time it passes by it will take you.
ISA.28.19	It will pass by morning after morning,
ISA.28.19	during the day and during the night.
ISA.28.19	Understanding this message brings only terror.

ISA.28.20	The blanket is too narrow to serve as a cover.

ISA.28.21	He will do his work, his unexpected work,
ISA.28.21	and perform his deeds, his mysterious deeds.

ISA.28.23	 Open your ears, and listen to me!
ISA.28.23	Pay attention, and hear me!
ISA.28.24	 Does a farmer go on plowing every day so he can plant?
ISA.28.24	Does he continue to break up the soil and make furrows in the ground?
ISA.28.25	 When he has smoothed its surface,
ISA.28.25	doesn’t he scatter black cumin seed and plant cumin?
ISA.28.25	Doesn’t he plant wild wheat in rows?
ISA.28.25	Doesn’t he put barley in its own area
ISA.28.25	and winter wheat at its borders?
ISA.28.26	 God will guide him in judgment,
ISA.28.26	and his God will teach him.
ISA.28.27	 Black cumin isn’t threshed 
ISA.28.27	and wagon wheels aren’t rolled over cumin.
ISA.28.27	Black cumin is beaten with a rod
ISA.28.27	and cumin with a stick.
ISA.28.28	 Grain is ground into flour, but the grinding eventually stops.
ISA.28.28	It will be threshed.
ISA.28.28	The wheels of his cart will roll over it,
ISA.28.28	but his horses won’t crush it.
ISA.28.29	 All of this has come from the L
ISA.28.29	His counsel is wonderful, and his wisdom is great.
ISA.29.1	 How horrible it will be for you Ariel, Ariel,
ISA.29.1	the city where David camped.
ISA.29.1	Let year after year go by.
ISA.29.1	Let your annual festivals go on.

ISA.29.7	They will go to war against it, blockade it, and torment it.
ISA.29.7	All of this will be like a dream, like a vision in the night.
ISA.29.8	 They will be like hungry people who dream that they’re eating
ISA.29.8	and wake up to find they’re hungry.

ISA.29.8	that fight against Mount Zion.

ISA.29.10	He will shut your eyes. (Your eyes are the prophets.)

ISA.29.15	Their deeds are done in the dark,
ISA.29.15	and they say, “No one can see us”
ISA.29.15	and “No one can recognize us.”
ISA.29.16	 You turn things upside down!
ISA.29.16	Is the potter no better than his clay?
ISA.29.16	Can something that has been made
ISA.29.16	say about its maker, “He didn’t make me”?
ISA.29.16	Can a piece of pottery

ISA.29.17	 In a very short time Lebanon will be turned into a fertile field
ISA.29.17	and the fertile field will be considered a forest.

ISA.29.19	The poorest of people will find joy in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.29.20	 Tyrants will be gone.
ISA.29.20	Mockers will be finished.
ISA.29.20	All who look for ways to do wrong will come to an end:
ISA.29.21	 those who make people sin with words,
ISA.29.21	those who lay traps for judges,
ISA.29.21	those who, without any reason, deny justice
ISA.29.21	to people who are in the right.
ISA.29.22	 This is what the L

ISA.29.23	 When they see all their children,
ISA.29.23	the children I made with my hands,
ISA.29.23	they will acknowledge my name as holy.
ISA.29.23	They will treat the Holy One of Jacob as holy.
ISA.29.23	They will stand in terror of the God of Israel.

ISA.30.2	They look for shelter under Pharaoh’s protection
ISA.30.2	and look for refuge in Egypt’s shadow.
ISA.30.3	 But Pharaoh’s protection will be their shame,
ISA.30.3	and the refuge in Egypt’s shadow will be their disgrace.
ISA.30.4	 Although Pharaoh’s officials are in Zoan

ISA.37.1	 When King Hezekiah heard the message, he tore his clothes in grief, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the L
ISA.37.2	 Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and the leaders of the priests, clothed in sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz.
ISA.37.3	 They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day filled with misery, punishment, and disgrace. We are like a woman who is about to give birth but doesn’t have the strength to do it.

ISA.37.8	 The field commander returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah. He had heard that the king left Lachish. 
ISA.37.9	 Now, Sennacherib heard that King Tirhakah of Sudan was coming to fight him.
ISA.37.9	When he heard this, he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
ISA.37.10	 “Tell King Hezekiah of Judah, ‘Don’t let the god whom you trust deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be put under the control of the king of Assyria. 
ISA.37.11	 You heard what the kings of Assyria did to all countries, how they totally destroyed them. Will you be rescued? 
ISA.37.12	 Did the gods of the nations which my ancestors destroyed rescue Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? 
ISA.37.13	 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the cities of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’ ”

ISA.37.27	 Those who live in these cities are weak, discouraged, and ashamed.
ISA.37.27	They will be like plants in the field,
ISA.37.27	like fresh, green grass on the roofs,
ISA.37.27	dried up by the east wind.

ISA.37.38	 While he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, assassinated him and escaped to the land of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon succeeded him as king.

ISA.38.9	 King Hezekiah of Judah wrote this after he was sick and became well again:
ISA.38.10	 I thought that in the prime of my life
ISA.38.10	I would go down to the gates of Sheol

ISA.38.12	You rolled it up like a shepherd’s tent.
ISA.38.12	You rolled up my life like a weaver.
ISA.38.12	You cut me off from the loom.
ISA.38.12	You ended my life in one day.
ISA.38.13	 I cried out until morning
ISA.38.13	as if a lion had crushed all my bones.
ISA.38.13	You ended my life in one day.
ISA.38.14	 I chirped like swallows and cranes.
ISA.38.14	I cooed like doves.
ISA.38.14	My eyes were tired from looking up to heaven.
ISA.38.14	I’ve suffered miserably, O Lord!
ISA.38.14	Please help me!
ISA.38.15	 What can I say now that he has spoken to me?
ISA.38.15	He has done this.

ISA.39.1	 At that time Baladan’s son, King Merodach Baladan of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah. He had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and had recovered. 
ISA.39.2	 Hezekiah was so happy with them that he showed the messengers his warehouse: the silver, gold, balsam, fine olive oil, his entire armory, and everything in his treasury. Hezekiah showed them everything in his palace and every corner of his kingdom.
ISA.39.3	 Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did these men say? And where did they come from?”
ISA.39.3	Hezekiah answered, “They came to me from the distant country of Babylon.”
ISA.39.4	 Isaiah asked, “What did they see in your palace?”
ISA.39.4	Hezekiah answered, “They saw everything in my palace, and I showed them everything in my treasury.”

ISA.40.11	He gently helps the sheep and their lambs.
ISA.40.12	 Who has measured the water of the sea 
ISA.40.12	or measured the sky with the length of his hand?

ISA.40.18	 To whom, then, can you compare God?
ISA.40.18	To what statue can you compare him?
ISA.40.19	 Craftsmen make idols.
ISA.40.19	Goldsmiths cover them with gold.
ISA.40.19	Silversmiths make silver chains for them.
ISA.40.20	 The poorest people choose wood that will not rot

ISA.40.20	to set up idols that will not fall over.
ISA.40.21	 Don’t you know?
ISA.40.21	Haven’t you heard?
ISA.40.21	Haven’t you been told from the beginning?
ISA.40.21	Don’t you understand the foundations of the earth?
ISA.40.22	 God is enthroned above the earth,

ISA.40.22	He stretches out the sky like a canopy
ISA.40.22	and spreads it out like a tent to live in.
ISA.40.23	 He makes rulers unimportant
ISA.40.23	and makes earthly judges worth nothing.
ISA.40.24	 They have hardly been planted.
ISA.40.24	They have hardly been sown.
ISA.40.24	They have hardly taken root in the ground.

ISA.44.9	 All who make idols are nothing. Their precious treasures are worthless. Their own witnesses do not see or know anything, so they will be put to shame. 
ISA.44.10	 Nothing comes from making gods or casting metal idols. 
ISA.44.11	 Everyone associated with the gods will be put to shame. The craftsmen themselves are only human. Let them all get together and take their stand. They will be frightened and ashamed together.
ISA.44.12	 Blacksmiths shape iron into tools. They work them over the coals and shape them with hammers, working them with their strong arms. They get hungry, and their strength fails. If they don’t drink water, they will faint.
ISA.44.13	 Carpenters measure blocks of wood with ⌊chalk⌋ lines. They mark them with pens. They carve them with chisels and mark them with compasses. They carve them into forms of people, beautiful people, so the idols can live in shrines.
ISA.44.14	 They cut down cedars for themselves. Then they choose fir trees or oaks. They let them grow strong among the trees in the forest. Then they plant cedars, and the rain makes them grow. 
ISA.44.15	 These trees become ⌊fuel⌋ for people to burn. So they take some of them and warm themselves with them. They start fires and bake bread. They also make gods from these trees and worship them. They make them into carved statues and bow in front of them. 
ISA.44.16	 Half of the wood they burn in the fire. Over this half they roast meat that they can eat until they are full. They also warm themselves and say, “Ah! We are warm. We can see the fire!” 
ISA.44.17	 But the rest of the wood they make into gods, carved statues. They bow to them and worship them. They pray to them, saying, “Rescue us, because you are our gods.”
ISA.44.18	 They don’t know or understand anything. Their eyes are plastered shut, so they can’t see. And their minds are closed, so they can’t understand. 
ISA.44.19	 No one stops to think. No one has enough knowledge or understanding to say, “I burned half of the wood in the fire. I also baked bread over its coals. I roasted meat and ate it. Now I am making the rest of the wood into a disgusting thing and bowing to a block of wood.” 
ISA.44.20	 They eat ashes because they are deceived. Their own misguided minds lead them astray. They can’t rescue themselves or ask themselves, “Isn’t what I hold in my right hand a false god?”
ISA.44.21	 Remember these things, Jacob:
ISA.44.21	You are my servant, Israel.
ISA.44.21	I formed you; you are my servant.
ISA.44.21	Israel, I will not forget you.
ISA.44.22	 I made your rebellious acts disappear like a thick cloud
ISA.44.22	and your sins like the morning mist.
ISA.44.22	Come back to me, because I have reclaimed you.
ISA.44.23	 Sing with joy, you heavens, because the L
ISA.44.23	Rejoice, you deep places of the earth.

ISA.44.24	I spread out the earth all alone.

ISA.44.25	and make fools of fortunetellers.
ISA.44.25	I make wise men retreat
ISA.44.25	and turn their knowledge into foolishness.
ISA.44.26	 He confirms the word of his servant
ISA.44.26	and fulfills the plan of his messengers.
ISA.44.26	He says about Jerusalem, “It will be inhabited.”
ISA.44.26	He says about the cities of Judah, “They will be rebuilt.”
ISA.44.26	He says about their ruins, “I will restore them.”
ISA.44.27	 He says to the deep water, “Dry up.”
ISA.44.27	So I will dry up your rivers.
ISA.44.28	 He says about Cyrus, “He is my shepherd.
ISA.44.28	He will do everything I want him to do.”
ISA.44.28	He says about Jerusalem, “It will be rebuilt.”
ISA.44.28	He says about the temple, “Your foundation will be laid.”
ISA.45.1	 This is what the L
ISA.45.1	I have held him by his right hand
ISA.45.1	so he could conquer the nations ahead of him,
ISA.45.1	strip kings of their power,
ISA.45.1	and open doors ahead of him
ISA.45.1	so that the gates would not be shut.
ISA.45.2	 I will go ahead of you, Cyrus, and smooth out the rough places.
ISA.45.2	I will break down the bronze doors and cut through the iron bars.
ISA.45.3	 I will give you treasures from dark places and hidden stockpiles.
ISA.45.3	Then you will know that I, the L

ISA.45.9	Does your work say to you, “There are no handles”?
ISA.45.10	 How horrible it will be for the one

ISA.45.10	or to his mother, “Why did you go through labor pains for me?”

ISA.45.12	I stretched out the heavens with my own hands.
ISA.45.12	I commanded all the stars ⌊to shine⌋.
ISA.45.13	 I prepared Cyrus for my righteous purpose.
ISA.45.13	I will make all his roads straight.
ISA.45.13	He will build my city and let my exiles go free

ISA.45.14	 This is what the L
ISA.45.14	The products from Egypt, the merchandise from Sudan,

ISA.45.14	They will belong to you.
ISA.45.14	They will follow you.
ISA.45.14	They will come to you in chains.
ISA.45.14	They will bow to you and pray to you,
ISA.45.14	“Certainly God is with you alone, and there is no other God.”
ISA.45.15	 Certainly, you are a God who has hidden himself.
ISA.45.15	You are the God of Israel, the Savior!
ISA.45.16	 Those who make idols will be ashamed and disgraced.
ISA.45.16	They will go away completely disgraced.

ISA.45.17	You will never again be ashamed or disgraced.
ISA.45.18	 The L

ISA.45.18	This is what the L
ISA.45.18	I am the L
ISA.45.19	 I haven’t spoken privately or in some dark corner of the world.
ISA.45.19	I didn’t say to Jacob’s descendants,

ISA.46.2	They go away into captivity.
ISA.46.3	 Listen to me, descendants of Jacob,
ISA.46.3	the few people left of the nation of Israel.
ISA.46.3	I’ve carried you since your birth.
ISA.46.3	I’ve taken care of you from the time you were born.
ISA.46.4	 Even when you’re old, I’ll take care of you.
ISA.46.4	Even when your hair turns gray, I’ll support you.
ISA.46.4	I made you and will continue to care for you.
ISA.46.4	I’ll support you and save you.
ISA.46.5	 To whom will you compare me and make me equal?
ISA.46.5	To whom will you compare me so that we can be alike?
ISA.46.6	 People pour gold out of their bags and weigh silver on scales.
ISA.46.6	They hire a goldsmith. He makes it into a god.
ISA.46.6	They bow down and worship it.
ISA.46.7	 They lift it on their shoulders and carry it.
ISA.46.7	They set the idol in its place, and it stands there.
ISA.46.7	It doesn’t move from its place.
ISA.46.7	If they cry to it for help, it can’t answer.
ISA.46.7	It can’t rescue them from their distress.
ISA.46.8	 Remember this, and take courage.

ISA.46.9	I am God, and there’s no one like me.
ISA.46.10	 From the beginning I revealed the end.
ISA.46.10	From long ago I told you things that had not yet happened, saying,

ISA.46.11	I will call someone for my plan from a faraway land.

ISA.47.6	 I was angry with my people.
ISA.47.6	I dishonored those who belong to me.
ISA.47.6	I put them under your control.
ISA.47.6	You showed them no mercy.
ISA.47.6	You placed a heavy burden on old people.
ISA.47.7	 You said, “I will always be a queen.”
ISA.47.7	You didn’t carefully consider these things
ISA.47.7	or keep in mind how they would end.
ISA.47.8	 Now then, listen to this, you lover of pleasure.
ISA.47.8	You live securely and say to yourself,
ISA.47.8	“I’m the only one, and there’s no one else.
ISA.47.8	I won’t live as a widow.
ISA.47.8	I won’t suffer the loss of children.”
ISA.47.9	 In one day both of these will happen to you instantly:
ISA.47.9	the loss of your children and your husband.
ISA.47.9	All this will happen to you in spite of
ISA.47.9	your evil magic and your many spells.
ISA.47.10	 You feel safe in your wickedness
ISA.47.10	and say, “No one can see me.”
ISA.47.10	Your wisdom and knowledge have led you astray,
ISA.47.10	so you say to yourself,
ISA.47.10	“I’m the only one, and there’s no one else.”
ISA.47.11	 But evil will happen to you.
ISA.47.11	You won’t know how to keep it away.
ISA.47.11	Disaster will strike you.
ISA.47.11	You won’t be able to stop it.
ISA.47.11	Destruction will overtake you suddenly.
ISA.47.11	You won’t expect it.
ISA.47.12	 Keep practicing your spells and your evil magic.
ISA.47.12	You have practiced them ever since you were young.
ISA.47.12	You may succeed.
ISA.47.12	You may cause terror.
ISA.47.13	 You are worn out by your many plans.
ISA.47.13	Let your astrologers and your stargazers,
ISA.47.13	who foretell the future month by month,
ISA.47.13	come to you, rise up, and save you.
ISA.47.14	 They are like straw.
ISA.47.14	Fire burns them.
ISA.47.14	They can’t rescue themselves from the flames.
ISA.47.14	There are no glowing coals to keep them warm
ISA.47.14	and no fire for them to sit by.
ISA.47.15	 This is how it will be for those who have worked with you,
ISA.47.15	for those who have been with you ever since you were young.
ISA.47.15	They will go their own ways,
ISA.47.15	and there will be no one to save you.
ISA.48.1	 Listen to this, descendants of Jacob!
ISA.48.1	You are given the name of Israel.
ISA.48.1	You are descended from Judah.
ISA.48.1	You take oaths by the name of the L

ISA.48.3	 From the beginning I revealed to you what would happen.
ISA.48.3	These words came out of my mouth,
ISA.48.3	and I made them known.
ISA.48.3	Suddenly, I acted, and they happened.
ISA.48.4	 I know that you are stubborn.
ISA.48.4	Like iron, you are hardheaded.
ISA.48.4	Like bronze, nothing gets through your thick skull.
ISA.48.5	 That is why I revealed to you what would happen long ago.
ISA.48.5	I told you about them before they happened.
ISA.48.5	⌊I did this⌋ so you couldn’t say,
ISA.48.5	“My gods have done these things.
ISA.48.5	My carved idols and my metal idols
ISA.48.5	have commanded them to happen.”
ISA.48.6	 You’ve heard these words.
ISA.48.6	Now look at all this.
ISA.48.6	Won’t you admit it?
ISA.48.6	From now on I will reveal to you new things,
ISA.48.6	hidden things that you do not know.
ISA.48.7	 They are created now, not in the past.
ISA.48.7	You haven’t heard about them before today,
ISA.48.7	so you can’t say that you already knew about them.
ISA.48.8	 You have never heard about them.
ISA.48.8	You have never known about them.
ISA.48.8	Your ears have never been open to hear them before.
ISA.48.8	I know that you’ve acted very treacherously

ISA.49.3	 He said to me,
ISA.49.3	“You are my servant Israel.

ISA.49.4	 But I said,
ISA.49.4	“I have worked hard for nothing.

ISA.62.4	and your land will be married.
ISA.62.5	 As a young man marries a woman,
ISA.62.5	so your sons will marry you.
ISA.62.5	As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride,
ISA.62.5	so your God will rejoice over you.
ISA.62.6	 I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem.
ISA.62.6	They will never be silent day or night.
ISA.62.6	Whoever calls on the L
ISA.62.7	 and do not give him any rest until he establishes Jerusalem
ISA.62.7	and makes it an object of praise throughout the earth.
ISA.62.8	 The L
ISA.62.8	“I will never again let your enemies eat your grain,
ISA.62.8	nor will foreigners drink the new wine which you made.”
ISA.62.9	 Those who harvest grain
ISA.62.9	will eat it and praise the L
ISA.62.9	Those who gather grapes
ISA.62.9	will drink wine in my holy courtyards.
ISA.62.10	 Go through! Go through the gates!
ISA.62.10	Prepare a way for the people!
ISA.62.10	Build up! Build up the highway!
ISA.62.10	Clear away the stones!
ISA.62.10	Raise a flag for the people!
ISA.62.11	 The L
ISA.62.11	“Tell my people Zion,
ISA.62.11	‘Your Savior is coming.
ISA.62.11	His reward is with him,
ISA.62.11	and the people he has won arrive ahead of him.’ ”
ISA.62.12	 They will be called Holy People, Those Reclaimed by the L
ISA.62.12	and you will be called Sought After, a City Not Deserted.
ISA.63.1	 Who is this coming from Bozrah in Edom
ISA.63.1	with his clothes stained bright red?
ISA.63.1	Who is this dressed in splendor,
ISA.63.1	going forward with great strength?
ISA.63.1	“It is I, the L
ISA.63.1	I am powerful enough to save ⌊you⌋.”
ISA.63.2	 Why are your clothes red
ISA.63.2	and your garments like those who trample grapes in a winepress?
ISA.63.3	 “I have trampled alone in the winepress.
ISA.63.3	No one was with me.
ISA.63.3	In my anger I trampled on people.
ISA.63.3	In my wrath I stomped on them.
ISA.63.3	Their blood splattered my clothes
ISA.63.3	so all my clothing has been stained.
ISA.63.4	 I planned the day of vengeance.
ISA.63.4	The year for my reclaiming ⌊you⌋ has come.
ISA.63.5	 I looked, but there was no help.
ISA.63.5	I was astounded that there was no ⌊outside⌋ support.
ISA.63.5	So with my own power I won a victory.
ISA.63.5	My anger supported me.
ISA.63.6	 In my anger I trampled on people.
ISA.63.6	In my wrath I made them drunk
ISA.63.6	and poured their blood on the ground.”
ISA.63.7	 I will acknowledge the L
ISA.63.7	and ⌊sing⌋ the praises of the L
ISA.63.7	because of everything that the L
ISA.63.7	He has done many good things for the nation of Israel
ISA.63.7	because of his compassion and his unlimited mercy.
ISA.63.8	 He said, “They are my people,
ISA.63.8	children who will not lie to me.”
ISA.63.8	So he became their Savior.
ISA.63.9	 In all their troubles he was troubled,
ISA.63.9	and he was the Messenger who saved them.
ISA.63.9	In his love and compassion he reclaimed them.
ISA.63.9	He always held them and carried them in the past.
ISA.63.10	 But they rebelled and offended his Holy Spirit.
ISA.63.10	So he turned against them as their enemy; he fought against them.
ISA.63.11	 Then his people remembered Moses and the distant past.
ISA.63.11	Where is the one who brought them out of the sea
ISA.63.11	with the shepherds of his flock?
ISA.63.11	Where is the one who put his Holy Spirit in them?
ISA.63.12	 Where is the one who sent his powerful arm
ISA.63.12	to support the right hand of Moses?
ISA.63.12	Where is the one who divided the water in front of them
ISA.63.12	to make an everlasting name for himself?
ISA.63.13	 Where is the one who led them through the deep water?
ISA.63.13	Like horses in the wilderness,
ISA.63.13	they didn’t stumble.
ISA.63.14	 Like animals going down into a valley,
ISA.63.14	they were given rest by the L
ISA.63.14	In this way you guided your people
ISA.63.14	to make an honored name for yourself.
ISA.63.15	 Look down and see from heaven, from your holy and beautiful dwelling.
ISA.63.15	Where is your determination and might?
ISA.63.15	Where is the longing of your heart and your compassion?
ISA.63.15	Don’t hold back.
ISA.63.16	 You are our Father.
ISA.63.16	Even though Abraham doesn’t know us
ISA.63.16	and Israel doesn’t pay attention to us,
ISA.63.16	O L
ISA.63.16	Your name is our Defender From Everlasting.
ISA.63.17	 O L
ISA.63.17	and become so stubborn that we are unable to fear you?
ISA.63.17	Return for the sake of your servants.
ISA.63.17	They are the tribes that belong to you.
ISA.63.18	 Your holy people possessed the land for a little while.
ISA.63.18	Our enemies have trampled on your holy place.
ISA.63.19	 We have become like those whom you never ruled,
ISA.63.19	like those who are not called by your name.
ISA.64.1	 If only you would split open the heavens and come down!
ISA.64.1	The mountains would quake at your presence.
ISA.64.2	 Be like the fire that kindles brushwood and makes water boil.
ISA.64.2	Come down to make your name known to your enemies.
ISA.64.2	The nations will tremble in your presence.
ISA.64.3	 When you did awe-inspiring things that we didn’t expect,
ISA.64.3	you came down and the mountains quaked in your presence.
ISA.64.4	 No one has ever heard,
ISA.64.4	no one has paid attention,
ISA.64.4	and no one has seen any god except you.
ISA.64.4	You help those who wait for you.
ISA.64.5	 You greeted the one who gladly does right and remembers your ways.
ISA.64.5	You showed your anger, because we’ve sinned.
ISA.64.5	We’ve continued to sin for a long time.
ISA.64.5	Can we still be saved?
ISA.64.6	 We’ve all become unclean,
ISA.64.6	and all our righteous acts are like permanently stained rags.
ISA.64.6	All of us shrivel like leaves,
ISA.64.6	and our sins carry us away like the wind.
ISA.64.7	 No one calls on your name
ISA.64.7	or tries to hold on to you.
ISA.64.7	You have hidden your face from us.
ISA.64.7	You have let us be ruined by our sins.
ISA.64.8	 But now, L
ISA.64.8	We are the clay, and you are our potter.
ISA.64.8	We are the work of your hands.
ISA.64.9	 Don’t be too angry, L
ISA.64.9	Don’t remember our sin forever.
ISA.64.9	Now look, we are all your people.
ISA.64.10	 Your holy cities have become a desert.
ISA.64.10	Zion has become a desert.
ISA.64.10	Jerusalem is a wasteland.
ISA.64.11	 Our holy and beautiful temple, where our ancestors praised you,
ISA.64.11	has been burned to the ground.
ISA.64.11	All that we valued has been ruined.
ISA.64.12	 Despite these things, L
ISA.64.12	Will you be silent and make us suffer more than we can bear?
ISA.65.1	 I was ready to answer those who didn’t ask.
ISA.65.1	I was found by those who weren’t looking for me.
ISA.65.1	I said, “Here I am! Here I am!”
ISA.65.1	to a nation that didn’t worship me.
ISA.65.2	 I stretched out my hands all day long to stubborn people.
ISA.65.2	They chose to go the wrong direction.
ISA.65.2	They followed their own plans.
ISA.65.3	 These people constantly and openly provoked me.
ISA.65.3	They offered sacrifices in gardens
ISA.65.3	and burnt incense on brick altars.
ISA.65.4	 They sat among the graves and spent their nights in caves.
ISA.65.4	They ate pork and in their pots made broth from unclean foods.
ISA.65.5	 They said, “Stay away! Don’t touch me!
ISA.65.5	I’m holier than you are.”
ISA.65.5	They have become like smoke in my nose,
ISA.65.5	like a smoldering fire all day long.
ISA.65.6	 “Look! It is written in front of me.
ISA.65.6	I will not be silent, but I will repay.
ISA.65.6	I will repay you in full.
ISA.65.7	 I will repay you for your sins
ISA.65.7	and for the sins of your ancestors,” says the L
ISA.65.7	They burnt incense on the mountains and slandered me on the hills,
ISA.65.7	so I will be the first to pay them back in full.
ISA.65.8	 This is what the L
ISA.65.8	When someone finds juice for new wine in a cluster of grapes,
ISA.65.8	another person will say,
ISA.65.8	“Don’t destroy it, because there’s a blessing in it.”
ISA.65.8	In the same way, I will do this for my servants:
ISA.65.8	I will not destroy everything.
ISA.65.9	 I will bring ⌊with me⌋ Jacob’s descendant,
ISA.65.9	one who will inherit my mountains from Judah.
ISA.65.9	My chosen ones will inherit them.
ISA.65.9	My servants will live there.
ISA.65.10	 The Sharon Plain will be a pasture for flocks.
ISA.65.10	The Achor Valley will be a resting place for cattle
ISA.65.10	and for my people who search for me.
ISA.65.11	 You have abandoned the L
ISA.65.11	and forgotten my holy mountain.
ISA.65.11	You have prepared a table for the god of good fortune
ISA.65.11	and offered cups full of spiced wine to the goddess of destiny.
ISA.65.12	 Now I will destine you for death.
ISA.65.12	All of you will bow to be slaughtered.
ISA.65.12	I called, but you didn’t answer.
ISA.65.12	I spoke, but you didn’t listen.
ISA.65.12	You did what I consider evil.
ISA.65.12	You chose what I don’t like.
ISA.65.13	 This is what the L
ISA.65.13	My servants will eat, but you will be hungry.
ISA.65.13	My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty.
ISA.65.13	My servants will be glad, but you will be ashamed.
ISA.65.14	 My servants will sing because of the gladness in their hearts.
ISA.65.14	But you will cry because of your sadness
ISA.65.14	and wail because of your depression.
ISA.65.15	 Your name will be used as a curse by my chosen ones.
ISA.65.15	The Almighty L
ISA.65.15	and call his servants by another name.
ISA.65.16	 Whoever asks for a blessing in the land
ISA.65.16	will be blessed by the God of Truth.
ISA.65.16	Whoever swears an oath in the land
ISA.65.16	will swear by the God of Truth.
ISA.65.16	Past troubles are forgotten.
ISA.65.16	They are hidden from my eyes.
ISA.65.17	 I will create a new heaven and a new earth.
ISA.65.17	Past things will not be remembered.
ISA.65.17	They will not come to mind.
ISA.65.18	 Be glad, and rejoice forever in what I’m going to create,
ISA.65.18	because I’m going to create Jerusalem to be a delight
ISA.65.18	and its people to be a joy.
ISA.65.19	 I will rejoice about Jerusalem and be glad about my people.
ISA.65.19	Screaming and crying will no longer be heard in the city.
ISA.65.20	 There will no longer be an infant who lives for only a few days
ISA.65.20	or an old man who doesn’t live a long life.
ISA.65.20	Whoever lives to be a hundred years old will be thought of as young.
ISA.65.20	Whoever dies before he is a hundred years old will be cursed as a sinner.
ISA.65.21	 They will build houses and live there.
ISA.65.21	They will plant vineyards and eat fruit from them.
ISA.65.22	 They will not build homes and have others live there.
ISA.65.22	They will not plant and have others eat from it.
ISA.65.22	My people will live as long as trees,
ISA.65.22	and my chosen ones will enjoy what they’ve done.
ISA.65.23	 They will never again work for nothing.
ISA.65.23	They will never again give birth to children who die young,
ISA.65.23	because they will be offspring blessed by the L
ISA.65.23	The L
ISA.65.24	 Before they call, I will answer.
ISA.65.24	While they’re still speaking, I will hear.
ISA.65.25	 Wolves and lambs will feed together,
ISA.65.25	lions will eat straw like oxen,
ISA.65.25	and dust will be food for snakes.
ISA.65.25	“They will not hurt or destroy anyone anywhere on my holy mountain,”
ISA.65.25	says the L
ISA.66.1	 This is what the L
ISA.66.1	Heaven is my throne.
ISA.66.1	The earth is my footstool.
ISA.66.1	Where can you build a house or resting place for me?
ISA.66.2	 I have made all these things.
ISA.66.2	“That is why all these things have come into being,”
ISA.66.2	declares the L
ISA.66.2	I will pay attention to those
ISA.66.2	who are humble and sorry ⌊for their sins⌋
ISA.66.2	and who tremble at my word.
ISA.66.3	 Whoever kills a bull is like someone who kills a person.
ISA.66.3	Whoever sacrifices a lamb is like someone who breaks a dog’s neck.
ISA.66.3	Whoever offers a grain sacrifice
ISA.66.3	is like someone who ⌊offers⌋ pig’s blood.
ISA.66.3	Whoever burns incense is like someone who worships an idol.
ISA.66.3	People have certainly chosen their own ways,
ISA.66.3	and their souls delight in detestable things.
ISA.66.4	 So I will choose harsh treatment for them
ISA.66.4	and bring on them what they fear.
ISA.66.4	I called, but no one answered.
ISA.66.4	I spoke, but they didn’t listen.
ISA.66.4	They did what I consider evil.
ISA.66.4	They chose what I don’t like.

ISA.66.7	 Before a woman goes into labor, she gives birth.
ISA.66.7	Before she has labor pains, she delivers a child.
ISA.66.8	 Who has heard of such a thing?
ISA.66.8	Who has seen such things?
ISA.66.8	Can a country be born in one day?
ISA.66.8	Can a nation be born in a moment?
ISA.66.8	When Zion went into labor,
ISA.66.8	she also gave birth to her children.
ISA.66.9	 “Do I bring a mother to the moment of birth
ISA.66.9	and not let her deliver?” asks the L
ISA.66.9	“Do I cause a mother to deliver
ISA.66.9	and then make her unable to have children?” asks your God.
ISA.66.10	 All who love Jerusalem, be happy and rejoice with her.
ISA.66.10	All who mourn for her, be glad with her.
ISA.66.11	 You will nurse and be satisfied from her comforting breasts.
ISA.66.11	You will nurse to your heart’s delight at her full breasts.
ISA.66.12	 This is what the L
ISA.66.12	I will offer you peace like a river
ISA.66.12	and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream.
ISA.66.12	You will nurse and be carried in Jerusalem’s arms
ISA.66.12	and cuddled on her knees.
ISA.66.13	 As a mother comforts her child,
ISA.66.13	so will I comfort you.
ISA.66.13	You will be comforted in Jerusalem.

ISA.66.17	and prepare themselves for their garden rituals.
ISA.66.17	They go into the garden
ISA.66.17	and devour pork, disgusting things, and mice.
ISA.66.17	“They will come to an end at the same time,”
ISA.66.17	declares the L
ISA.66.18	 Because of their actions and their thoughts,
ISA.66.18	I am coming to gather the nations of every language.
ISA.66.18	They will come and see my glory.
ISA.66.19	 I will set up a sign among them
ISA.66.19	and send some of their survivors to the nations:
ISA.66.19	to Tarshish, Put and Lud, Meshech, Rosh, Tubal, Javan,
ISA.66.19	and to the distant coastlands
ISA.66.19	who have not heard of my fame or seen my glory.
ISA.66.19	They will tell about my glory among the nations.
ISA.66.20	 They will bring all your relatives
ISA.66.20	from every nation like a grain offering to the L
ISA.66.20	“They will come on horses, in chariots, in wagons,
ISA.66.20	on mules and camels to my holy mountain, Jerusalem,”
ISA.66.20	declares the L
ISA.66.20	They will come like the people of Israel who bring
ISA.66.20	their grain offerings in clean dishes to the L

JER.2.23	 “How can you say that you haven’t dishonored yourselves
JER.2.23	and haven’t followed other gods—the Baals?
JER.2.23	Look how you’ve behaved in the valley.
JER.2.23	Acknowledge what you’ve done.
JER.2.23	You are like a young camel that swiftly runs here and there.
JER.2.24	 You are like a wild donkey that is used to the desert,
JER.2.24	sniffing the wind while in heat.
JER.2.24	All who look for you won’t get tired.
JER.2.24	They will find you during your monthly period.
JER.2.25	 Don’t run until your feet are bare and your throats are dry.
JER.2.25	But you say that it’s useless.
JER.2.25	You love foreign gods and follow them.

JER.2.26	Their kings, princes, priests,
JER.2.26	and prophets will also feel ashamed.

JER.2.27	You call stone your mother.
JER.2.27	You’ve turned your backs, not your faces, to me.
JER.2.27	But when you’re in trouble, you ask me to come and rescue you.
JER.2.28	 Where are the gods that you made for yourselves?
JER.2.28	Let them come and rescue you when you’re in trouble.
JER.2.28	You have as many gods as you have cities, Judah!
JER.2.29	 “Why do you complain about me?
JER.2.29	All of you have rebelled against me,” declares the L
JER.2.30	 “I have punished your children without results.

JER.2.32	 A young woman can’t forget her jewelry or a bride her veils.
JER.2.32	Yet, my people have forgotten me for countless days.
JER.2.33	 You carefully planned ways to look for love.
JER.2.33	You taught your ways to wicked women.

JER.2.36	 You change your mind so easily.
JER.2.36	You will be put to shame by Egypt

JER.3.1	 A saying:
JER.3.1	If a man divorces his wife
JER.3.1	and she leaves him and marries another man,
JER.3.1	her first husband shouldn’t go back to her again.
JER.3.1	The land would become thoroughly polluted.

JER.3.2	 “Look at the bare hills, and see.
JER.3.2	You have had sex with men in every place.
JER.3.2	You sat by the roadside waiting for them like a nomad in the desert.
JER.3.2	You have polluted the land with your prostitution and wickedness.
JER.3.3	 So the rain has been withheld, and there have been no spring showers.
JER.3.3	Yet, you have the shameless look of a prostitute,
JER.3.3	and you refuse to blush.
JER.3.4	 But now you are calling to me.
JER.3.4	You say, ‘Father! You have been my companion
JER.3.4	ever since I was young.
JER.3.5	 He won’t hold a grudge forever.

JER.3.8	 Judah saw that I sent unfaithful Israel away because of her adultery and that I gave Israel her divorce papers. But treacherous Judah, her sister, wasn’t afraid. She also acted like a prostitute. 
JER.3.9	 Because she wasn’t concerned about acting like a prostitute, she polluted the land and committed adultery with standing stones and wood pillars. 
JER.3.10	 Even after all this, Israel’s treacherous sister Judah didn’t wholeheartedly come back to me. She was deceitful,” declares the L

JER.3.24	the shameful worship ⌊of Baal⌋

JER.3.24	their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters.
JER.3.25	 We must lie down in our shame

JER.4.5	 Report this message in Judah.
JER.4.5	Make it heard in Jerusalem.
JER.4.5	Say, “Blow the ram’s horn throughout the land.”
JER.4.5	Shout loudly and say, “Gather together!

JER.4.6	 Raise the flag to signal people to go to Zion.
JER.4.6	Take cover!
JER.4.6	Don’t just stand there!
JER.4.6	I’m bringing disaster and widespread destruction from the north.
JER.4.7	 A lion has come out of its lair.
JER.4.7	A destroyer of nations has set out.
JER.4.7	He has left his place to destroy your land.
JER.4.7	Your cities will be ruined, and no one will live in them.

JER.4.10	You said that everything would go well for them,
JER.4.10	but a sword is held at their throats.”

JER.4.11	It will not be a wind that winnows 
JER.4.12	 It will be a stronger wind than that.

JER.4.12	Now, I will pass sentence on them.”
JER.4.13	 The enemy comes up like clouds.
JER.4.13	His chariots are like a raging wind.
JER.4.13	His horses are faster than eagles.
JER.4.13	How horrible it will be for us! We will be destroyed!
JER.4.14	 Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart
JER.4.14	so that you may be rescued.
JER.4.14	Don’t continue making evil plans.
JER.4.15	 A message is heard from Dan,

JER.4.16	 Warn the nations about these things.
JER.4.16	Bring them to the attention of Jerusalem.
JER.4.16	“Hostile troops are coming from a distant country.
JER.4.16	They are shouting battle cries against the cities of Judah.

JER.4.19	My heart is beating wildly!
JER.4.19	My heart is pounding!
JER.4.19	I can’t keep quiet
JER.4.19	because I hear a ram’s horn sounding the alarm for war.
JER.4.20	 One disaster follows another.
JER.4.20	The whole land is ruined.
JER.4.20	My tents are suddenly destroyed.
JER.4.20	Their curtains are torn in an instant.
JER.4.21	 How long must I see the battle flag and hear the sound of rams’ horns?
JER.4.22	 “My people are fools. They don’t know me.

JER.4.28	I won’t change my plans, and I won’t turn back.
JER.4.29	 All the people in the city will flee
JER.4.29	at the sound of riders and archers.
JER.4.29	They will go off into the thickets
JER.4.29	and climb among the rocks.
JER.4.29	The entire city will be abandoned, and no one will live in it.
JER.4.30	 You are going to be destroyed!
JER.4.30	What are you going to do?
JER.4.30	Why do you dress in red and put on gold jewelry?
JER.4.30	Why do you wear eye shadow?
JER.4.30	You are making yourself beautiful for nothing.
JER.4.30	Your lovers reject you; they want to kill you.
JER.4.31	 I hear a woman in labor.
JER.4.31	I hear the woman cry with anguish as she gives birth to her first child.
JER.4.31	My people Zion are gasping for breath.
JER.4.31	They are stretching out their hands, saying,
JER.4.31	“How horrible it is for us!
JER.4.31	We’re defenseless in the presence of murderers!”
JER.5.1	 Walk around the streets of Jerusalem.
JER.5.1	Look around, and think about these things.
JER.5.1	Search the city squares.
JER.5.1	See if you can find anyone
JER.5.1	who does what is right and seeks the truth.
JER.5.1	Then I will forgive Jerusalem.

JER.5.5	and torn off their chains.
JER.5.6	 That is why a lion from the forest will attack them.
JER.5.6	A wolf from the wilderness will destroy them.
JER.5.6	A leopard will lie in ambush outside their cities.
JER.5.6	All who leave the cities will be torn to pieces,
JER.5.6	because they rebel so often
JER.5.6	and they become more and more unfaithful.
JER.5.7	 “Why should I forgive you?
JER.5.7	Your children abandoned me.
JER.5.7	They took godless oaths.
JER.5.7	They committed adultery, even though I satisfied their needs.
JER.5.7	They traveled in crowds to the houses of prostitutes.
JER.5.8	 They are like well-fed stallions that are wild with desire.

JER.36.12	 Then he went down to the scribe’s room in the king’s palace where all the scribes were sitting. The scribe Elishama, Delaiah (son of Shemaiah), Elnathan (son of Achbor), Gemariah (son of Shaphan), Zedekiah (son of Hananiah), and all the other officials were there. 
JER.36.13	 Micaiah told them everything he heard Baruch read from the scroll publicly. 
JER.36.14	 Then all the officials sent Jehudi, who was the son of Nethaniah, the grandson of Shelemiah, and the great-grandson of Cushi, to Baruch. Jehudi said to Baruch, “Bring the scroll that you read publicly, and come with me.” Baruch, son of Neriah, took the scroll and went with him to see the officers. 
JER.36.15	 They said to Baruch, “Please sit down, and read it to us.”
JER.36.15	So Baruch read it to them. 
JER.36.16	 When they heard everything, they turned to each other in terror. They said to Baruch, “We must tell the king everything.” 
JER.36.17	 Then they asked Baruch, “Please tell us how you wrote all this. Did Jeremiah dictate it to you?”
JER.36.18	 Baruch answered, “He dictated everything to me, and I wrote it on the scroll in ink.”
JER.36.19	 The officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah must hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”
JER.36.20	 After they put the scroll in the side room of the scribe Elishama, they went to the king in the courtyard and told him everything. 
JER.36.21	 Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. He took the scroll from the side room of the scribe Elishama. Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials standing by the king. 
JER.36.22	 It was the ninth month, and the king was in his winter house sitting in front of the fire in the fireplace. 
JER.36.23	 As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a scribe’s knife and throw them into the fire in the fireplace. He did this until the whole scroll was burned up. 
JER.36.24	 The king and all his attendants didn’t show any fear or tear their clothes in fear when they heard everything being read. 
JER.36.25	 Even when Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he refused to listen to them. 
JER.36.26	 The king commanded Jerahmeel (the king’s son), Seraiah (son of Azriel), and Shelemiah (son of Abdeel) to arrest the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah. But the L
JER.36.27	 After the king burned up the scroll that Baruch had written and that Jeremiah had dictated, the L
JER.36.28	 “Take another scroll, and write on it everything that was written on the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned. 
JER.36.29	 Say about King Jehoiakim of Judah, ‘This is what the L

JER.36.31	 I will punish him, his descendants, and his attendants for their wickedness. They refused to listen. So I will bring on them, on those who live in Jerusalem, and on the people of Judah all the disasters that I have threatened.’ ”
JER.36.32	 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch, son of Neriah. As Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it everything that was on the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned. They added many similar messages.
JER.37.1	 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon appointed Zedekiah, son of Josiah, to be king of Judah. Zedekiah succeeded Jehoiakin, son of Jehoiakim. 
JER.37.2	 But Zedekiah, his administrators, and the common people didn’t listen to what the L
JER.37.3	 King Zedekiah sent Jehucal (son of Shelemiah) and the priest Zephaniah (son of Maaseiah) to the prophet Jeremiah. They asked him, “Please pray to the L
JER.37.4	 Jeremiah was still free to come and go among the people. The people of Jerusalem hadn’t put him in prison yet. 
JER.37.5	 Pharaoh’s army had come from Egypt, and when the Babylonians who were blockading Jerusalem heard this news, they retreated from Jerusalem.
JER.37.6	 The L
JER.37.7	 “This is what the L
JER.37.8	 Then the Babylonians will return. They will attack the city, capture it, and burn it down.
JER.37.9	 “‘This is what the L
JER.37.10	 Even if you would defeat the entire Babylonian army so that they had only a few badly wounded men left in their tents, they would get up and burn down this city.’ ”
JER.37.11	 The Babylonian army had retreated from Jerusalem because Pharaoh’s army was coming. 
JER.37.12	 So Jeremiah wanted to leave Jerusalem and go to the territory of Benjamin to take possession of his property there among the people. 
JER.37.13	 But when he came to Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard there, whose name was Irijah, son of Shelemiah and grandson of Hananiah, arrested the prophet Jeremiah. He said, “You’re deserting to the Babylonians!”
JER.37.14	 Jeremiah answered, “That’s a lie! I’m not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah wouldn’t listen to him. Irijah arrested Jeremiah and took him to the officials. 
JER.37.15	 The officials were so angry with Jeremiah that they beat him and put him in prison in the scribe Jonathan’s house, which had been turned into a prison. 
JER.37.16	 Jeremiah went into a prison cell, and he stayed there a long time.
JER.37.17	 Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah, and the king asked him privately in the palace, “Is there any message from the L
JER.37.17	Jeremiah answered, “Yes! There is a message from the L
JER.37.18	 Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against you, your administrators, or these people? Why have you put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	 Where are the prophets who told you that the king of Babylon wouldn’t attack you and this land? 
JER.37.20	 But now, Your Majesty, please listen, and accept my plea for mercy. Don’t return me to the scribe Jonathan’s house, or I will die there.”
JER.37.21	 King Zedekiah gave the command to have Jeremiah put in the courtyard of the prison. He gave him a loaf of bread every day from the bakers’ street until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the prison.
JER.38.1	 Shephatiah (son of Mattan), Gedaliah (son of Pashhur), Jucal (son of Shelemiah), and Pashhur (son of Malchiah) heard that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people. 
JER.38.2	 They heard Jeremiah say, “This is what the L
JER.38.3	 “This is what the L
JER.38.4	 Then the officials said to the king, “Have this man put to death. He discourages the soldiers who are left in this city and all the people by telling them such things. This man is not trying to help these people; he’s trying to hurt them.”
JER.38.5	 King Zedekiah answered, “He’s in your hands. I won’t do anything to stop you.”
JER.38.6	 So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s son. It was in the courtyard of the prison. They used ropes to lower Jeremiah into the cistern. There was no water in the cistern, only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
JER.38.7	 But an official in the royal palace, Ebed Melech from Sudan, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the cistern. The king happened to be sitting at Benjamin Gate. 
JER.38.8	 Ebed Melech left the royal palace and spoke to the king at Benjamin Gate. 
JER.38.9	 “Your Majesty, everything that these men have done to the prophet Jeremiah is wrong. They have thrown him into the cistern, where he’ll starve to death, because there’s no more bread in the city.”
JER.38.10	 Then the king gave Ebed Melech from Sudan this command: “Take 30 men from here, and lift the prophet Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies.”
JER.38.11	 So Ebed Melech took the men with him and went to the royal palace, to a room under the treasury. He took rags and torn clothes from there and lowered them with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern. 
JER.38.12	 Ebed Melech from Sudan said to Jeremiah, “Put these rags and torn clothes under your arms to protect you from the ropes.” Jeremiah did. 
JER.38.13	 They used the ropes to pull Jeremiah up and lift him out of the cistern. Then Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the prison.
JER.38.14	 King Zedekiah sent for the prophet Jeremiah and brought him to the third entrance in the L
JER.38.15	 Jeremiah answered Zedekiah, “If I answer you, you’ll kill me. If I give you advice, you won’t listen to me.”
JER.38.16	 So King Zedekiah secretly swore an oath to Jeremiah, “The L
JER.38.17	 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the L
JER.38.18	 But if you don’t surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians. They will burn it down, and you will not escape from them.”
JER.38.19	 King Zedekiah answered Jeremiah, “I’m afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Babylonians. The Babylonians may hand me over to them, and they will torture me.”
JER.38.20	 Jeremiah said, “You will not be handed over to them. Obey the L
JER.38.21	 But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the L
JER.38.22	 All the women who are left in the palace of Judah’s king will be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon. These women will say:
JER.38.22	‘Your trusted friends have misled you and used you.
JER.38.22	Your feet are stuck in the mud, and your friends have deserted you.’
JER.38.23	 “All your wives and children will be brought to the Babylonians. You will not escape from them. You will be captured by the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned down.”
JER.38.24	 Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Don’t let anyone know about this conversation, or you will die. 
JER.38.25	 The officials may find out that I’ve been talking with you. They may come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you. Don’t hide anything from us, or we’ll kill you.’ 
JER.38.26	 If they come to you, say to them, ‘I asked the king not to send me back to Jonathan’s house to die there.’ ”
JER.38.27	 All the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him. He told them exactly what the king had told him to say. So they stopped questioning him, because they hadn’t heard his conversation with the king. 
JER.38.28	 Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the prison until the day Jerusalem was captured.
JER.39.1	 In the tenth month of Zedekiah’s ninth year as king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked Jerusalem with his entire army and blockaded it. 
JER.39.2	 On the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year as king, they broke into the city.
JER.39.3	 Then all the officers of the king of Babylon came in and sat in Middle Gate: Nergal (the quartermaster), Samgar Nebo (the chief officer), Nergal (the quartermaster and the chief fortuneteller), and all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon.
JER.39.4	 When King Zedekiah of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled. They left the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls, and they took the road to the plain ⌊of Jericho⌋. 
JER.39.5	 The Babylonian army pursued them and caught up with Zedekiah in the plain of Jericho. They arrested him and brought him to Babylon’s King Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah in the territory of Hamath. The king of Babylon passed sentence on him. 
JER.39.6	 The king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons as Zedekiah watched at Riblah. He also slaughtered all the leaders of Judah. 
JER.39.7	 Then he blinded Zedekiah, put him in bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon.
JER.39.8	 The Babylonians burned down the royal palace and the people’s homes, and they tore down the walls of Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	 Nebuzaradan, Babylon’s captain of the guard, captured the few people left in the city, those who surrendered to him, and the rest of the people. 
JER.39.10	 But Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left some poor people who had nothing in the land of Judah. At that time he gave them vineyards and farms.
JER.39.11	 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gave Nebuzaradan an order concerning Jeremiah. He said, 
JER.39.12	 “Take him, and look after him. Don’t harm him in any way, but do for him whatever he asks.” 
JER.39.13	 Nebuzaradan (the captain of the guard), Nebushazban (the chief official), Nergal (the quartermaster and the chief fortuneteller), and all the other leaders of the king of Babylon sent for Jeremiah. 
JER.39.14	 They took Jeremiah out of the courtyard of the prison and handed him over to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to take him home. So he lived among the people.
JER.39.15	 While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the prison, the L
JER.39.16	 “Say to Ebed Melech from Sudan, ‘This is what the L
JER.39.17	 But at that time I will rescue you, declares the L
JER.39.18	 I will certainly rescue you. You will not die in war. You will escape with your life because you trusted me, declares the L

JER.40.2	 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah aside and said to him, “The L

JER.40.4	 Today I’m removing the chains from your hands. If you would like to come with me to Babylon, come, and I’ll look after you. But if you don’t want to come with me to Babylon, don’t come. The whole land is yours. Go wherever you want.
JER.40.5	 “If you wish to remain,
JER.40.6	 Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, at Mizpah and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.
JER.40.7	 All the army commanders and their men who were in the field heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, to govern the country and some of the country’s poorest men, women, and children who had not been taken away to Babylon. 
JER.40.8	 These are the commanders who went with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah: Ishmael (son of Nethaniah), Johanan and Jonathan (sons of Kareah), Seraiah (son of Tanhumeth), the sons of Ephai from Netophah, and Jezaniah, who was the son of a man from Maacah. 
JER.40.9	 Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, swore an oath to them and their men. He said, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Babylonians. Live in this country, serve the king of Babylon, and you will prosper. 
JER.40.10	 I’m going to live in Mizpah and represent you when the Babylonians come to us. Gather grapes, summer fruit, and olive oil, and put them in storage jars. Live in the cities you have taken over.”
JER.40.11	 Now, all the Jews who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and in all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a few survivors in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to govern them. 
JER.40.12	 So all the Jews returned from all the places where they had been scattered. They came to Judah and to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They gathered a large harvest of grapes and summer fruit.
JER.40.13	 Kareah’s son Johanan and all the army commanders who were still in the country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. 
JER.40.14	 They asked him, “Do you know that King Baalis of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael, Nethaniah’s son, to kill you?” However, Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, didn’t believe them.
JER.40.15	 Then Johanan, Kareah’s son, secretly asked Gedaliah at Mizpah, “Let me kill Ishmael, Nethaniah’s son. No one will know about it. Why should he kill you? All the Jews who have gathered around you would scatter. What is left of Judah would disappear.”
JER.40.16	 Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, told Johanan, Kareah’s son, “Don’t do that! What you are saying about Ishmael is a lie.”
JER.41.1	 In the seventh month Ishmael (son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama, a descendant of the royal family and of the king’s officers) went with ten men to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. As they ate together at Mizpah, 
JER.41.2	 Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him got up, drew their swords, and killed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. So they assassinated the man whom the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the land. 
JER.41.3	 Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah as well as the Babylonian soldiers that he found there.
JER.41.4	 The day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew about it, 
JER.41.5	 80 men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. Their beards were shaved off, their clothes were torn, and cuts were on their bodies. They brought grain offerings and incense to the L
JER.41.6	 Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, left Mizpah to meet them, crying as he went. When he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam.”
JER.41.7	 When they came into the city, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and his men slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern. 
JER.41.8	 However, ten men from the group had said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us! We have wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey hidden in the country.” So he left them alone and didn’t kill them along with the others.
JER.41.9	 Now, the cistern where Ishmael threw all the bodies of the men he had killed was the same one that King Asa made as a part of his defense against King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled it with the bodies.
JER.41.10	 Then Ishmael took captive the rest of the people who were at Mizpah. He captured the king’s daughters and all the other people who had been left at Mizpah. They were the people whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had put under the control of Gedaliah, son of Ahikam. Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, took them captive and left for Ammon.
JER.41.11	 When Kareah’s son Johanan and all the army commanders who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, had done, 
JER.41.12	 they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael. They caught up with him at the large pool in Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	 When all the people who were with Ishmael saw Kareah’s son Johanan and all the army commanders who were with him, they were glad. 
JER.41.14	 Then all the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and ran to Kareah’s son Johanan. 
JER.41.15	 Ishmael and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to Ammon.
JER.41.16	 Then Kareah’s son Johanan and all the army commanders who were with him brought back the rest of the people of Mizpah whom he had rescued from Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah, son of Ahikam. Johanan brought back men, women, children, soldiers, and commanders from Gibeon. 
JER.41.17	 When they left Gibeon, they stayed near Bethlehem at Geruth Kimham on their way to Egypt. 
JER.41.18	 They were afraid of the Babylonians because Ishmael had killed Gedaliah whom the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the land.
JER.42.1	 Then all the army commanders along with Kareah’s son Johanan and Hoshaiah’s son Jezaniah and all the people, from the least important to the most important, came to the prophet Jeremiah. 
JER.42.2	 They said to him, “Please listen to our request, and pray to the L
JER.42.3	 Let the L
JER.42.4	 The prophet Jeremiah answered them, “I have listened to your request. I will pray to the L
JER.42.5	 They said to Jeremiah, “May the L
JER.42.6	 We will obey the L
JER.42.7	 After ten days the L
JER.42.8	 So Jeremiah called Kareah’s son Johanan, all the army commanders who were with him, and all the people from the least important to the most important. 
JER.42.9	 Jeremiah said to them, “You sent me to plead your case humbly to the L
JER.42.10	 Suppose you stay in this land. Then I will build you up and not tear you down. I will plant you and not uproot you. I will change my plans about the disaster I’ve brought on you. 
JER.42.11	 Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Don’t be afraid of him, declares the L
JER.42.12	 I will have compassion on you. I will make him have compassion on you and return you to your land.
JER.42.13	 “But suppose you say, ‘We won’t stay in this land,’ and you disobey the L
JER.42.14	 Then you say, ‘We’ll go to Egypt, where we won’t have to see war, hear the sound of a ram’s horn, or be hungry. We’ll stay there.’
JER.42.15	 “Now, listen to the word of the L
JER.42.16	 Then the wars you fear will catch up with you in Egypt. The famines you dread will follow you to Egypt, and you will die there. 
JER.42.17	 So all the people who decide to go and live in Egypt will die in wars, famines, and plagues. No one will survive or escape the disasters I will bring on them.
JER.42.18	 “This is what the L
JER.42.19	 “The L
JER.42.20	 You only deceived yourselves when you sent me to the L
JER.42.21	 I have told you today, but you won’t obey anything the L
JER.42.22	 But now, you need to know that you will die in wars, famines, or plagues in the place where you want to go and live.”
JER.43.1	 So Jeremiah finished telling all the people the message from the L
JER.43.2	 Azariah (son of Hoshaiah), Johanan (son of Kareah), and all the arrogant people said to Jeremiah, “You’re lying! The L
JER.43.3	 But Baruch, son of Neriah, has turned you against us in order to hand us over to the Babylonians. Then they will kill us or take us as captives to Babylon.”
JER.43.4	 So Johanan (son of Kareah), all the army commanders, and all the people didn’t obey the L
JER.43.5	 Johanan (son of Kareah) and all the army commanders took all the people who were left in Judah to Egypt. These were all the people who had come back to Judah from the places where they had been scattered. 
JER.43.6	 They took men, women, children, and the king’s daughters. They took every person whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had left with Gedaliah, son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, including the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch, son of Neriah. 
JER.43.7	 They didn’t listen to the L
JER.43.8	 Then the L
JER.43.9	 “Take some large stones, and bury them under the brick pavement at the entrance to the Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes. Do this while the people of Judah watch you. 
JER.43.10	 Say to them, ‘This is what the L
JER.43.11	 He will defeat Egypt. He will bring death to those who are supposed to die. He will capture those who are supposed to be captured. He will kill in battle those who are supposed to be killed in battle. 
JER.43.12	 He 
JER.43.13	 At Beth Shemesh he will break the monuments in Egypt and burn down the temples of Egypt’s gods.’ ”
JER.44.1	 The L
JER.44.2	 This is what the L
JER.44.3	 It is because their people did evil, and they made me angry. They went to burn incense and serve other gods that neither you nor your ancestors heard of. 
JER.44.4	 I have sent my servants the prophets to you again and again to tell you not to do these detestable things that I hate. 
JER.44.5	 But you wouldn’t listen or pay attention. You wouldn’t turn from your wicked ways and wouldn’t stop burning incense as an offering to other gods. 
JER.44.6	 That is why my fury and anger were poured out and continued to burn in the cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem. So they became the desolate ruin that they are today.
JER.44.7	 Now, this is what the L
JER.44.8	 Why do you make me angry by burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live. You will destroy yourselves and be cursed and ridiculed by all the nations on earth. 
JER.44.9	 Have you forgotten the wicked things done by your ancestors, by the kings of Judah and their wives, and by you and your wives in Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	 You have not humbled yourselves even to this day. You haven’t feared me or lived your lives by my teachings or by my decrees that I gave your ancestors.
JER.44.11	 This is what the L
JER.44.12	 I will take away from Judah those who are left, those who were determined to go to live in Egypt. They will die in Egypt. All of them, from the least important to the most important, will die in wars or be brought to an end by famines. They will become something cursed, ridiculed, and disgraced. 
JER.44.13	 I will punish those living in Egypt as I punished Jerusalem with wars, famines, and plagues. 
JER.44.14	 None of the people of Judah who went to live in Egypt will survive or return to Judah, where they long to return and live. Only a few refugees will return there.
JER.44.15	 Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, all the women who were standing there, and all the people who lived at Pathros in Egypt answered Jeremiah. They said, 
JER.44.16	 “We won’t listen to the message that you have spoken to us in the L
JER.44.17	 We will do everything we said we would do. We will burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out wine offerings to her as our ancestors, our kings, and our officials did in the cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem. We had plenty to eat then, and we lived comfortably and saw no disaster. 
JER.44.18	 But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out wine offerings to her, we have had nothing but wars and famines.”
JER.44.19	 The women added, “When we burned incense to the queen of heaven, poured out wine offerings to her, and made cakes for her with her image on them, do you think our husbands didn’t approve?”
JER.44.20	 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, to everyone who answered him, 
JER.44.21	 “Doesn’t the L
JER.44.22	 The L
JER.44.23	 You burned incense as offerings to other gods, sinned against the L
JER.44.24	 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, “Listen to the word of the L

JER.44.26	 But listen to the word of the L
JER.44.27	 I am going to watch over them. I am going to watch over them to bring disasters, not blessings. In Egypt the people from Judah will die in wars and famines until everyone is gone. 
JER.44.28	 Those who escape the wars will return to Judah from Egypt. Then all the people of Judah who went to live in Egypt will know whose words have come true, mine or theirs. 
JER.44.29	 I will give you this sign,’ declares the L
JER.44.30	 This is what the L
JER.45.1	 This is the message that the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch, son of Neriah. Baruch wrote these things on a scroll as Jeremiah dictated them during the fourth year that Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, was king of Judah. Jeremiah said, 
JER.45.2	 “This is what the L
JER.45.3	 You said, ‘I’m so miserable! The L

JER.46.2	 This is the message about Egypt, about the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon defeated his army at Carchemish along the Euphrates River during the fourth year that Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, was king of Judah.
JER.46.3	 “Get your large and small shields ready; advance into battle.

JER.52.5	 The blockade of the city lasted until Zedekiah’s eleventh year as king. 
JER.52.6	 On the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine in the city became so severe that the common people had no food.
JER.52.7	 The enemy broke through the city walls, and all Judah’s soldiers fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls beside the king’s garden. While the Babylonians were attacking the city from all sides, they took the road to the plain ⌊of Jericho⌋.

JER.52.26	 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
JER.52.27	 The king of Babylon executed them at Riblah in the territory of Hamath. So the people of Judah were captives as they left their land.

EZK.1.1	 On the fifth day of the fourth month in the thirtieth year, while I was living among the exiles by the Chebar River, the sky opened, and I saw visions from God. 
EZK.1.2	 On the fifth day of the month, during the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiakin, 
EZK.1.3	 the L
EZK.1.4	 As I looked, I saw a storm coming from the north. There was an immense cloud with flashing lightning surrounded by a bright light. The middle of the lightning looked like glowing metal. 
EZK.1.5	 In the center of the cloud I saw what looked like four living creatures. They were shaped like humans, 
EZK.1.6	 but each of them had four faces and four wings. 
EZK.1.7	 Their legs were straight, their feet were like those of calves, and they glittered like polished bronze. 
EZK.1.8	 They had human hands under their wings on each of their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings. 
EZK.1.9	 Their wings touched each other. The creatures went straight ahead, and they did not turn as they moved.
EZK.1.10	 Their faces looked like this: From the front, each creature had the face of a human. From the right, each one had the face of a lion. From the left, each one had the face of a bull. And from the back, each one had the face of an eagle. 
EZK.1.11	 That is what their faces looked like. Their wings were spread out, pointing upward. Each creature had two wings with which they touched each other. The other two wings covered their bodies. 
EZK.1.12	 Each of the creatures went straight ahead. They went wherever their spirit wanted to go, and they didn’t turn as they moved. 
EZK.1.13	 The living creatures looked like burning coals and torches. Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning came out of the fire. 
EZK.1.14	 The living creatures ran back and forth like lightning.
EZK.1.15	 As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each of them. 
EZK.1.16	 This is how the wheels looked and how they were made: They looked like beryl. All four wheels looked the same. They looked like a wheel within a wheel. 
EZK.1.17	 Whenever they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without turning as they moved. 
EZK.1.18	 The rims of the wheels were large and frightening. They were covered with eyes.
EZK.1.19	 When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved with them. When the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. 
EZK.1.20	 Wherever their spirit wanted to go, the creatures went. The wheels rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
EZK.1.21	 So whenever the creatures moved, the wheels moved. Whenever the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still. And whenever the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
EZK.1.22	 Something like a dome was spread over the heads of the living creatures. It looked like dazzling crystal. 
EZK.1.23	 Under the dome, each creature had two wings that were stretched out straight, touching one another. Each creature had two wings that covered its body. 
EZK.1.24	 When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings. The sound was like the noise of rushing water, like the thunder of the Almighty, like the commotion in an army camp. When the creatures stood still, they lowered their wings.
EZK.1.25	 A voice came from above the dome over their heads as they stood still with their wings lowered. 
EZK.1.26	 Above the dome over their heads was something that looked like a throne made of sapphire. On the throne was a figure that looked like a human. 
EZK.1.27	 Then I saw what he looked like from the waist up. He looked like glowing bronze with fire all around it. From the waist down, he looked like fire. A bright light surrounded him. 
EZK.1.28	 The brightness all around him looked like a rainbow in the clouds. It was like the L
EZK.2.1	 He said to me, “Son of man, stand up, and I will speak to you.” 
EZK.2.2	 As he spoke to me, the Spirit entered me, stood me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.
EZK.2.3	 He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel. They are people from a nation that has rebelled against me. They and their ancestors have rebelled against me to this day. 
EZK.2.4	 I am sending you to these defiant and stubborn children. Tell them, ‘This is what the Almighty L
EZK.2.5	 Whether these rebellious people listen or not, they will realize that a prophet has been among them. 
EZK.2.6	 Son of man, don’t be afraid of them or the things they say. Don’t be afraid, even though thorns and thistles are around you and you live among scorpions. Don’t let the things they say frighten you. Don’t be terrified in their presence, even though they are rebellious people. 
EZK.2.7	 Speak my words to them whether they listen or not, because they are rebellious. 
EZK.2.8	 But you, son of man, listen to what I say. Don’t be rebellious like those rebellious people. Open your mouth, and eat what I am giving to you.”
EZK.2.9	 As I looked, I saw a hand stretched out toward me. In it was a scroll. 
EZK.2.10	 He spread the scroll in front of me. There was writing on the front and back. There were funeral songs, songs of mourning, and horrible things written on it.
EZK.3.1	 The L

EZK.40.20	 Then the man measured the length and width of the gateway, leading to the outer courtyard. This was the gateway that faced north. 
EZK.40.21	 Its three guardrooms, its recessed walls, and its entrance hall were the same size as those in the east gateway. The gateway was 87½ feet long and 44 feet wide. 
EZK.40.22	 Its windows, recessed walls, and palm tree pictures were the same size as those in the east gateway. Seven steps went up to it and led to its entrance hall. 
EZK.40.23	 The inner courtyard had a gateway opposite the north gate just like the east gateway. The man measured the distance from one gate to the other gate. It was 175 feet.
EZK.40.24	 Then the man led me to the south side, and I saw a gateway that faced south. He measured its recessed walls and its entrance hall. They were the same size as those of the other gateways. 
EZK.40.25	 The gateway and its entrance hall had windows on all sides like the windows in the other gateways. It was 87½ feet long and 44 feet wide. 
EZK.40.26	 Seven steps went up to it and led to its entrance hall. Pictures of palm trees were carved on the recessed walls, one picture on each side. 
EZK.40.27	 The inner courtyard had a gateway facing south. The man measured the distance from the gateway on the south side to its opposite gateway. It was 175 feet.
EZK.40.28	 Then the man brought me to the inner courtyard through the south gateway. He measured the south gateway. It was the same size as the others. 
EZK.40.29	 Its guardrooms, recessed walls, and entrance hall were the same size as the other gateways. The guardrooms and the entrance hall had windows all around. The gateway was 87½ feet long and 44 feet wide. 
EZK.40.30	 There were entrance halls all around the inner courtyard. They were all 44 feet long and 9 feet wide. 
EZK.40.31	 The entrance halls faced the outer courtyard. Pictures of palm trees were carved on the recessed walls, and eight steps led up to each gateway.
EZK.40.32	 Then the man brought me to the east side of the inner courtyard. He measured the gateway. It was the same size as the others. 
EZK.40.33	 Its guardrooms, recessed walls, and entrance halls were the same size as those of the other gateways. Its guardrooms and entrance hall had windows all around. The gateway was 87½ feet long and 44 feet wide. 
EZK.40.34	 Its entrance hall faced the outer courtyard. Pictures of palm trees were carved on the recessed walls, and eight steps led up to the gateway.
EZK.40.35	 Then the man brought me to the north gateway. He measured it. It was the same size as the others. 
EZK.40.36	 Its guardrooms, recessed walls, and entrance hall had windows all around. The gateway was 87½ feet long and 44 feet wide. 
EZK.40.37	 Its recessed walls faced the outer courtyard. Pictures of palm trees were carved on the recessed walls, and eight steps led up to the gateway.
EZK.40.38	 There was a room with a door that opened toward the entrance hall of the gateway. This is the room where the priests washed the animals for the burnt offerings. 
EZK.40.39	 In the entrance hall of the gateway there were two tables on each side of the room. On these tables the animals were slaughtered for burnt offerings, offerings for sin, and guilt offerings. 
EZK.40.40	 On each side of the entrance to the north gateway there were two tables, and on the other side of the entrance hall of the gateway there were two tables. 
EZK.40.41	 So there were four tables on each side of the gateway, eight tables in all, on which they slaughtered animals. 
EZK.40.42	 There were four tables made of cut stone for burnt offerings. They were 3 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 21 inches high. On these tables the priests laid the utensils that were used to slaughter animals for burnt offerings and sacrifices. 
EZK.40.43	 Double-pronged hooks, three inches long, were attached to the wall all around the room, and the tables were for the meat of the animals. 
EZK.40.44	 Outside the gateways to the inner courtyard were the rooms for the singers in the inner courtyards. One room was at the side of the north gateway. It faced south. The other room was at the side of the south gateway. It faced north. 
EZK.40.45	 The man said to me, “This room that faces south is for the priests who serve in the temple. 
EZK.40.46	 The room that faces north is for the priests who serve at the altar. These priests are Zadok’s descendants. They are the only Levites who are able to come near the L
EZK.40.47	 The man measured the courtyard. It was a perfect square—175 feet long and 175 feet wide. And the altar was in front of the temple.
EZK.40.48	 Then the man brought me to the entrance hall of the temple and measured its recessed walls. They were 9 feet on each side. The gateway was 24½ feet wide, and the walls on each side were 5 feet wide. 
EZK.40.49	 The entrance hall was 35 feet long and 21 feet wide. Steps led up to it. Pillars stood by the recessed walls, one on each side of the entrance hall.
EZK.41.1	 Then the man brought me into the holy place in the temple and measured the recessed walls. They were 10½ feet wide on each side. 
EZK.41.2	 The entrance was 17½ feet wide, and on each side of the entrance the walls were 9 feet wide. Then he measured the length of the holy place. It was 70 feet long and 35 feet wide.
EZK.41.3	 Then the man went inside and measured the passageway. It was 3½ feet thick. The entrance was 10½ feet high and 12 feet wide. 
EZK.41.4	 Then he measured the room at the end of the holy place. It was 35 feet long and 35 feet wide. The man said to me, “This is the most holy place.”
EZK.41.5	 Next, the man measured the temple wall. It was 10½ feet wide. The width of each side room around the temple was 7 feet. 
EZK.41.6	 The rooms were arranged on three different stories. There were 30 rooms on each story. These rooms had supports all the way around the temple wall, but these supports were not fastened to the temple wall. 
EZK.41.7	 The side rooms grew wider all the way around as they went up, story after story. The surrounding structure went from story to story all around the temple. The structure grew wider as it went higher. A stairway went from the first story through the second story to the third story.
EZK.41.8	 I also saw a raised base all around the temple. This base was the foundation for the side rooms. It measured the full length of the measuring rod, 10½ feet. 
EZK.41.9	 The outer wall of the side rooms was 9 feet thick. There was an open area between the side rooms connected to the temple 
EZK.41.10	 and the priests’ rooms. It was 35 feet wide and went all around the temple. 
EZK.41.11	 The doors in the side rooms were entrances into the open area. There was one door to the north and another to the south. The base of the open area was 9 feet wide all the way around.
EZK.41.12	 At the far end of the open area, on the west side of the temple, was a building 122½ feet wide. The wall of the building was 9 feet thick all the way around, and it was 157½ feet long.
EZK.41.13	 Then the man measured the temple. It was 175 feet long. This included the open area with the building and its walls. All together it was 175 feet long. 
EZK.41.14	 The eastern side of the temple, including the open area, was also 175 feet wide. 
EZK.41.15	 He also measured the length of the building facing the courtyard on the west side along with its corridors on both sides. It was 175 feet long.
EZK.41.15	The holy place and the most holy place were paneled. 
EZK.41.16	 The doorposts, the small windows, and the corridors of all three stories were paneled. The walls, from the floor up to the windows, were paneled. 
EZK.41.17	 In the space above the door to the most holy place and on the walls all around it, 
EZK.41.18	 there were pictures of angels 
EZK.41.19	 the face of a man, which was turned toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion, which was turned toward a palm tree on the other side. These pictures were carved all around the temple. 
EZK.41.20	 Pictures of angels and palm trees were carved on the walls from the floor to the space above the door.
EZK.41.21	 The doorframes in the holy place were square. In front of the most holy place was something similar. 
EZK.41.22	 There was a wooden altar, 5 feet high and 3½ feet wide. Its corners, its base, and its sides were made of wood. Then the man told me, “This is the table that is in the presence of the L
EZK.41.23	 The holy place and the most holy place had two doors. 
EZK.41.24	 Each of the doors were double doors that swung open. 
EZK.41.25	 Pictures of angels and palm trees were carved on the doors of the holy place as on the walls. There was a wooden roof hanging over the outer entrance hall. 
EZK.41.26	 There were small windows and palm trees on both sides of the entrance hall, on the side rooms of the temple, and on the roofs.
EZK.42.1	 Then the man led me out toward the north to the outer courtyard. He brought me to the side rooms opposite both the open area and the northern building. 
EZK.42.2	 The building that faced north was 175 feet long and 87½ feet wide. 
EZK.42.3	 Opposite the inner courtyard was an area that was 35 feet wide, and opposite the pavement of the outer courtyard were corridors facing corridors on all three stories. 
EZK.42.4	 In front of the side rooms was a walkway, 17½ feet wide and 175 feet long. The doors of these side rooms faced north.
EZK.42.5	 The side rooms on the third story were narrower than those on the first or second stories of the building because the corridors took space away from them. 
EZK.42.6	 The rooms were in three stories. They didn’t have pillars like the pillars in the courtyards. That is why the rooms on the third story were set farther back than those on the first and second stories. 
EZK.42.7	 There was a wall which ran parallel to the side rooms and the outer courtyard. It ran alongside the side rooms for 87½ feet. 
EZK.42.8	 The row of rooms in the outer courtyard was 87½ feet long. The rooms that faced the temple were 175 feet long. 
EZK.42.9	 These lower side rooms had an entrance on the east side. A person was able to enter the outer courtyard through them.
EZK.42.10	 There were side rooms parallel to the wall of the courtyard on the south side.
EZK.42.11	 There was a walkway in front of them like the one that was in front of the side rooms on the north side. These side rooms were as long and as wide as the northern rooms. They had the same exits, dimensions, and doors. 
EZK.42.12	 The doors to the south rooms were the same as the doors to the north rooms. There was a doorway at the other end of the walkway that was parallel to the corresponding wall that ran eastward. People entered through that doorway.
EZK.42.13	 Then the man said to me, “The northern and southern side rooms that face the open area are holy rooms. These rooms are where the priests who come near the L
EZK.42.14	 Once the priests enter the holy place, they must not go out of the holy place into the outer courtyard until they leave behind the clothes that they wore as they served. These clothes are holy. The priests must put on other clothes. Then they can go into the area that is for the people.”
EZK.42.15	 When the man had finished measuring the inner part of the temple area, he led me out through the east gate. Then he measured all the way around the outer area. 
EZK.42.16	 He measured the east side with a measuring stick. It was 875 feet long according to the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.17	 He measured the north side. It was 875 feet long according to the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.18	 He measured the south side. It was 875 feet long according to the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.19	 He came around to the west side and measured it. It was 875 feet long according to the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.20	 So he measured all four sides. There was a wall all around it. The wall was 875 feet long and 875 feet wide. It separated what was holy from what was unholy.
EZK.43.1	 Then the man took me to the east gate. 
EZK.43.2	 I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the sound of rushing water, and the earth was shining because of his glory. 
EZK.43.3	 This vision was like the one I saw when he came 
EZK.43.4	 The L
EZK.43.5	 The Spirit lifted me and brought me into the inner courtyard. I saw the L
EZK.43.6	 I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple while the man was standing beside me. 
EZK.43.7	 The voice said to me, “Son of man, this is the place where my throne is and the place where my feet rest. This is where I will live among the Israelites forever. Then the people of Israel and their kings will no longer dishonor my holy name by acting like prostitutes, nor will they dishonor it with the dead bodies of their kings. 
EZK.43.8	 They put their doorway by my doorway and their doorposts by my doorposts. Only a wall separated me from them. They dishonored my holy name because of the disgusting things that they have done. So I destroyed them in my anger. 
EZK.43.9	 Now they must stop acting like prostitutes and take the dead bodies of their kings far away from me. Then I will live among them forever.
EZK.43.10	 “Son of man, describe this temple to the people of Israel. Then they will be ashamed because of their sins. Let them study the plans. 
EZK.43.11	 Suppose they are ashamed of everything that they have done. Then show them the design of the temple, its arrangements, its exits and entrances—its entire design. Tell them about all its rules and regulations. Then write these things down for them so that they can remember its design and follow all its rules.
EZK.43.12	 “This is a regulation of the temple: The whole area all the way around the top of the mountain is most holy. Yes, this is a regulation of the temple.”
EZK.43.13	 These are the measurements of the altar, using royal measurements. (The royal measuring stick was 21 inches long.) The base of the altar was 21 inches high and 21 inches wide. All around the edge of the altar was a rim measuring 9 inches wide. This was the height of the altar: 
EZK.43.14	 From the base on the ground to the lower ledge it was 3½ feet high, and from the lower ledge to the upper ledge it was 7 feet high and 21 inches wide. 
EZK.43.15	 The place where the sacrifices were burned was 7 feet high. There were four horns above it. 
EZK.43.16	 It was square, 21 feet wide and 21 feet long. 
EZK.43.17	 The upper ledge was also square. It was 24½ feet long and 24½ feet wide. It had a rim all the way around that was 10½ inches wide. Its base was 21 inches. The steps to the altar faced east.
EZK.43.18	 Then the man said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Almighty L
EZK.43.19	 Give a young bull to the priests as an offering for sin. These priests are Zadok’s descendants, men from the tribe of Levi, who can come near me and serve me. 
EZK.43.20	 Take some of the bull’s blood, and put it on the altar’s four horns, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim all the way around the altar. When you do this, you will remove sin from the altar and make peace with the L
EZK.43.21	 Then take a young bull as an offering for sin, and burn it in the place appointed near the temple, outside the holy place.
EZK.43.22	 “On the second day bring a male goat that has no defects as an offering for sin. Remove sin from the altar as you did with the young bull.

EZK.43.27	 When those days are over, on the eighth day, the priests must sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept them, declares the Almighty L
EZK.44.1	 Then the man took me back to the outer east gate of the holy place, and the gate was shut. 
EZK.44.2	 The L

EZK.44.11	 They could have served in my holy place. They could have guarded the gates of the temple. They could have served in the temple by slaughtering the animals for the burnt offerings and the sacrifices for the people. They could have stood in front of the people and served them. 
EZK.44.12	 But they served the people by standing in front of their idols and by making Israel fall into sin. So I raised my hand and swore that they would be punished for their sins, declares the L
EZK.44.13	 They must not come near me and serve me as priests. They must not come near any of my holy things or my most holy things. They must suffer disgrace because of the disgusting things that they have done. 
EZK.44.14	 I will assign them all of the less important work in the temple.
EZK.44.15	 “‘But the priests who are Levites and descendants of Zadok took care of my holy place when the Israelites wandered away from me. They may come near me and serve me, and they may stand in my presence. They may bring fat and blood to me, declares the Almighty L
EZK.44.16	 They may enter my holy place, come near my table to serve me, and take care of everything I gave them. 
EZK.44.17	 When they enter the gateways to the inner courtyard, they must wear linen clothes. They must have no wool on them while they serve in the gateways to the inner courtyard and in the temple. 
EZK.44.18	 They must wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments. They must not wear anything that makes them sweat. 
EZK.44.19	 When they go out among the people in the outer courtyard, they must take off the clothes that they wore as they served. They must leave their clothes in the side rooms of the holy place and put on other clothes so that they do not transfer the holiness from their clothes to the people.
EZK.44.20	 “‘They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long. They must keep the hair on their heads trimmed. 
EZK.44.21	 None of the priests may drink wine when they enter the inner courtyard. 
EZK.44.22	 They must not marry widows or women who have been divorced. They may marry only virgins from the nation of Israel or widows of priests. 
EZK.44.23	 They must teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is unholy. They must show the people how to tell the difference between what is clean and what is unclean.
EZK.44.24	 In all disputes the priests must act as judges and make decisions based on my laws. They must obey my rules and my regulations at all my festivals. They must observe holy days to worship me.
EZK.44.25	 “‘A priest must not make himself unclean by going near a dead body. But a priest may become unclean if the dead person is his father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or unmarried sister. 
EZK.44.26	 After a priest is made clean, he must wait seven days. 
EZK.44.27	 When he enters the inner courtyard of the holy place to serve in the holy place, he must bring his offering for sin, declares the Almighty L
EZK.44.28	 “‘The priests will have no inheritance. I am their inheritance. Don’t give them any possessions in Israel. The priests belong to me.

EZK.44.30	 The priests should have the best of all the first ripened fruits. The best of every gift from all your contributions must go to the priests. The best of your dough must go to the priests. This will cause a blessing to rest on your home. 
EZK.44.31	 The priests must never eat any bird or animal that has died naturally or was killed by other wild animals.

His territory will be as large as the territory of one of the tribes.

EZK.46.19	 The man brought me through a passage beside the gateway to the side rooms that faced north. These rooms were reserved for the priests. He showed me a place on the west side of the rooms. 
EZK.46.20	 He said to me, “This is the place where the priests must boil the meat for the guilt offering and the offering for sin. This is the place where they must bake grain offerings so that they don’t have to bring the offerings into the outer courtyard. This way they won’t transfer holiness to the people.”
EZK.46.21	 Then the man led me to the outer courtyard and took me past the four corners of the courtyard. I saw that in each corner of the courtyard there was a smaller courtyard. 
EZK.46.22	 The smaller courtyards that were in each of the four corners of the courtyard were 60 feet long and 45 feet wide. All four of the smaller courtyards in the corners of the courtyard were the same size. 
EZK.46.23	 Around each of the four courtyards were stone walls, and these walls were equipped with fireplaces.
EZK.46.24	 Then the man said to me, “These are the kitchens where the temple servants must boil the people’s sacrifices.”
EZK.47.1	 Then the man took me back to the door of the temple. I saw water flowing from under the entrance of the temple toward the east. (The temple faced east.) The water was flowing under the south side of the temple, south of the altar. 
EZK.47.2	 Then he led me through the north gate and around to the outer east gate. The water was flowing down the south side of the gate.
EZK.47.3	 With a measuring line in his hand, the man went eastward. He measured off 1,500 feet and led me through the water. The water came up to my ankles. 
EZK.47.4	 Then he measured off another 1,500 feet and led me through the water. The water came up to my knees. He measured off another 1,500 feet and led me through the water. The water came up to my waist. 
EZK.47.5	 Then he measured another 1,500 feet. But the water had risen so much that it became a river which I couldn’t cross. The river was too deep to cross except by swimming. 
EZK.47.6	 Then he asked me, “Son of man, do you see this?”
EZK.47.7	 Then the man led me back along the bank of the river. As I went back, I saw many trees on both sides of the river. 
EZK.47.8	 Then the man said to me, “This water flows through the land to the east, down into the Jordan Valley, and into the Dead Sea. When the water flows into the Dead Sea, it will replace the salt water there with fresh water. 
EZK.47.9	 Wherever the river flows, there will be many fish and animals. The river will make the water in the Dead Sea fresh. Wherever the river flows, it will bring life. 
EZK.47.10	 From En Gedi to En Eglaim people will be standing on the shore of the sea with their fishing nets spread out. As many kinds of fish will be there as there are in the Mediterranean Sea. 
EZK.47.11	 But the water in the swamps and marshes won’t become fresh. It will remain salty. 
EZK.47.12	 All kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves won’t wither, and they won’t fail to produce fruit. Each month they will produce fresh fruit because this water flows from the holy place. The fruit will be good food, and the leaves will be used for healing.”
EZK.47.13	 This is what the Almighty L
EZK.47.14	 Divide the land equally. I raised my hand and swore that I would give the land to your ancestors. So this land will be your inheritance.
EZK.47.15	 This is the northern border for the land: On the north side the border will run from the Mediterranean Sea all the way to Hethlon and Hamath Pass. It will run through the city of Zedad and through 
EZK.47.16	 Berothah and Sibraim, which are between the borders of Damascus and Hamath. It will run to Hazer Hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. 
EZK.47.17	 So the border will run from the Mediterranean Sea to Hazar Enon on the border of Damascus. The border of Hamath will lie to the north. This is the north side.
EZK.47.18	 On the east side the border will run between Hauran and Damascus. The Jordan River will serve as the border between Gilead and the land of Israel. The border will continue from the Dead Sea down to Tamar. This is the east side.
EZK.47.19	 On the south side the border will run from Tamar to the oasis at Meribah in Kadesh along the ravine to the Mediterranean Sea. This is the southern border.
EZK.47.20	 On the west side the Mediterranean Sea is the border up to a point opposite Hamath Pass. This is the west side.
EZK.47.21	 Divide this land among yourselves for each of the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	 Divide it by drawing lots. This land will be for you. It will also be for the foreign residents who live among you and have given birth to children while they lived with you. Think of them as Israelites. They will draw lots with you for their inheritance among the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.23	 Foreign residents will receive their share of the inheritance with the people of the tribe among whom they are living, declares the Almighty L
EZK.48.1	 These are the names of the tribes. Beginning at the northern border, Dan will have one part of the land. It will extend from the road to Hethlon to Hamath Pass and Hazar Enon, on the northern border of Damascus near Hamath, from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.2	 Asher will have one part of the land and border Dan on the south. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.3	 Naphtali will have one part of the land and border Asher on the south. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.4	 Manasseh will have one part of the land and border Naphtali on the south. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.5	 Ephraim will have one part of the land and border Manasseh on the south. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.6	 Reuben will have one part of the land and border Ephraim on the south. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.7	 Judah will have one part of the land and border Reuben on the south. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.8	 The land that you set aside as a special gift for the L
EZK.48.9	 This special land that you set aside for the L
EZK.48.10	 This holy area will belong to the priests. On the north side it will be 43,750 feet long. On the west side it will be 17,500 feet wide. On the east side it will be 17,500 feet wide. On the south side it will be 43,750 feet long. The L
EZK.48.11	 This land that has been set apart will belong to the priests who are descendants of Zadok. They took care of my holy place. They didn’t wander away with the Israelites as the Levites did. 
EZK.48.12	 So they will have a special portion from the land. It will be the holiest part of land, next to the land belonging to the Levites.
EZK.48.13	 Alongside the land belonging to the priests will be the land belonging to the Levites. It will be 43,750 feet long and 17,500 feet wide. 
EZK.48.14	 They must not sell any of it or trade any of it. They must not let others have the best part of the land, because the land is the L
EZK.48.15	 A strip of land, 8,750 feet wide by 43,750 feet long, will be left for cities, homes, and pastures. The city will be in the middle of it. 
EZK.48.16	 These will be the measurements for the city: On the north side it will be 7,875 feet long. On the south side it will be 7,875 feet long. On the east side it will be 7,875 feet wide. And on the west side it will be 7,875 feet wide. 
EZK.48.17	 The city’s pastureland will be 4,375 feet on the north, 4,375 feet on the south, 4,375 feet on the east, and 4,375 feet on the west. 
EZK.48.18	 The rest of the land borders the holy area and runs lengthwise. This land will be 17,500 feet on its east side and 17,500 feet on its west side. It will be used to provide food for the city workers. 
EZK.48.19	 City workers from all the tribes in Israel will farm it. 
EZK.48.20	 The whole area will be 43,750 feet square. You must give this land as a special gift to the L
EZK.48.21	 Whatever is left on the east side and west side of the holy area and the city property will belong to the prince. This land will extend eastward from the holy area to the eastern border, and it will extend westward to the western border. Both of these areas are as long as one of the sections of the tribes. These areas belong to the prince, and the holy area with the holy place of the temple will be between them. 
EZK.48.22	 So the Levites’ property and the city’s property will be between the prince’s part of the land. What is between Judah’s and Benjamin’s boundaries will belong to the prince.
EZK.48.23	 This is what the rest of the tribes will receive: Benjamin will have one part of the land. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.24	 Simeon will have one part of the land and border Benjamin on the south. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.25	 Issachar will have one part of the land and border Simeon on the south. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.26	 Zebulun will have one part of the land and border Issachar on the south. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.27	 Gad will have one part of the land and border Zebulun on the south. It will extend from the eastern border to the western border.
EZK.48.28	 The southern border of Gad will run south from Tamar to the oasis at Meribah in Kadesh, and it will run along the Brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. 
EZK.48.29	 This is the land you will divide as your inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these are their areas, declares the Almighty L
EZK.48.30	 These will be the exits for the city: The north side will be 7,875 feet long. 
EZK.48.31	 The gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel. The three gates on the north side will be Reuben Gate, Judah Gate, and Levi Gate.
EZK.48.32	 The east side will be 7,875 feet long. The three gates on the east side will be Joseph Gate, Benjamin Gate, and Dan Gate.
EZK.48.33	 The south side will be 7,875 feet long. The three gates on the south side will be Simeon Gate, Issachar Gate, and Zebulun Gate.
EZK.48.34	 The west side will be 7,875 feet long. The three gates on the west side will be Gad Gate, Asher Gate, and Naphtali Gate.
EZK.48.35	 The city will measure about 31,500 feet all the way around. From then on the city’s name will be: The L
DAN.1.1	 In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and attacked it. 
DAN.1.2	 The Lord handed King Jehoiakim of Judah and some utensils from God’s temple over to Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar took the utensils to the temple of his god in Babylonia and put them in the temple treasury.
DAN.1.3	 The king told Ashpenaz, the chief-of-staff, to bring some of the Israelites, the royal family, and the nobility. 
DAN.1.4	 They were to be young men who were healthy, good-looking, knowledgeable in all subjects, well-informed, intelligent, and able to serve in the king’s palace. They were to be taught the language and literature of the Babylonians.
DAN.1.5	 The king arranged for them to get a daily allowance of the king’s rich food and wine. They were to be trained for three years. After that, they were to serve the king. 
DAN.1.6	 Among these young men were some Judeans: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
DAN.1.7	 The chief-of-staff gave them ⌊Babylonian⌋ names: To Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar. To Hananiah he gave the name Shadrach. To Mishael he gave the name Meshach. And to Azariah he gave the name Abednego.
DAN.1.8	 Daniel made up his mind not to harm himself by eating the king’s rich food and drinking the king’s wine. So he asked the chief-of-staff for permission not to harm himself in this way.
DAN.1.9	 God made the chief-of-staff kind and compassionate toward Daniel. 
DAN.1.10	 The chief-of-staff told Daniel, “I’m afraid of my master, the king. The king determined what you should eat and drink. If he sees that you look worse than the other young men your age, he would have my head cut off.”
DAN.1.11	 The chief-of-staff put a supervisor in charge of Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Daniel said to the supervisor, 
DAN.1.12	 “Please test us for ten days. Give us only vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	 Then compare us to the young men who are eating the king’s rich food. Decide how to treat us on the basis of how we look.”
DAN.1.14	 The supervisor listened to them about this matter and tested them for ten days. 
DAN.1.15	 After ten days they looked healthier and stronger than the young men who had been eating the king’s rich food. 
DAN.1.16	 So the supervisor took away the king’s rich food and wine and gave them vegetables.
DAN.1.17	 God gave these four men knowledge, wisdom, and the ability to understand all kinds of literature. Daniel could also understand all kinds of visions and dreams.
DAN.1.18	 At the end of the three-year training period, the chief-of-staff brought all the young men to Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	 The king talked to them and found no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah among all of them. So these four men served the king. 
DAN.1.20	 Whenever the king asked them about things that required wisdom and insight, he found that they knew ten times more than all the magicians and psychics in his whole kingdom.
DAN.1.21	 Daniel served the royal palace until the first year of King Cyrus ⌊of Persia⌋.
DAN.2.1	 During the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, he had some dreams. He was troubled, but he stayed asleep. 
DAN.2.2	 The king sent for the magicians, psychics, sorcerers, and astrologers so that they could tell him what he had dreamed. So they came to the king.
DAN.2.3	 The king said to them, “I had a dream, and I’m troubled by it. I want to know what the dream was.”
DAN.2.4	 The astrologers spoke to the king in Aramaic, “Your Majesty, may you live forever! Tell us the dream, and we’ll interpret it for you.”
DAN.2.5	 The king answered the astrologers, “I meant what I said! If you don’t tell me the dream and its meaning, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be turned into piles of rubble. 
DAN.2.6	 But if you tell me the dream and its meaning, I will give you gifts, awards, and high honors. Now tell me the dream and its meaning.”
DAN.2.7	 Once more they said, “Your Majesty, tell us the dream, and we’ll tell you its meaning.”
DAN.2.8	 The king replied, “I’m sure you’re trying to buy some time because you know that I meant what I said. 
DAN.2.9	 If you don’t tell me the dream, you’ll all receive the same punishment. You have agreed among yourselves to make up a phony explanation to give me, hoping that things will change. So tell me the dream. Then I’ll know that you can explain its meaning to me.”
DAN.2.10	 The astrologers answered the king, “No one on earth can tell the king what he asks. No other king, no matter how great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any magician, psychic, or astrologer. 
DAN.2.11	 What you ask is difficult, Your Majesty. No one can tell what you dreamed except the gods, and they don’t live with humans.”
DAN.2.12	 This made the king so angry and furious that he gave an order to destroy all the wise advisers in Babylon. 
DAN.2.13	 So a decree was issued that the wise advisers were to be killed, and some men were sent to find Daniel and his friends and kill them.
DAN.2.14	 While Arioch, the captain of the royal guard, was leaving to kill the wise advisers in Babylon, Daniel spoke to him using shrewd judgment. 
DAN.2.15	 He asked Arioch, the royal official, “Why is the king’s decree so harsh?” So Arioch explained everything to Daniel.
DAN.2.16	 Daniel went and asked the king to give him some time so that he could explain the dream’s meaning. 
DAN.2.17	 Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about this matter. 
DAN.2.18	 He told them to ask the God of heaven to be merciful and to explain this secret to them so that they would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise advisers in Babylon.
DAN.2.19	 The secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision during the night. So Daniel praised the God of heaven. 
DAN.2.20	 He said,
DAN.2.20	“Praise God’s name from everlasting to everlasting
DAN.2.20	because he is wise and powerful.
DAN.2.21	 He changes times and periods of history.
DAN.2.21	He removes kings and establishes them.
DAN.2.21	He gives wisdom to those who are wise
DAN.2.21	and knowledge to those who have insight.
DAN.2.22	 He reveals deeply hidden things.
DAN.2.22	He knows what is in the dark,
DAN.2.22	and light lives with him.
DAN.2.23	 God of my ancestors, I thank and praise you.
DAN.2.23	You gave me wisdom and power.
DAN.2.23	You told me the answer to our question.
DAN.2.23	You told us what the king wants to know.”
DAN.2.24	 Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy Babylon’s wise advisers. Daniel told him, “Don’t destroy Babylon’s wise advisers. Take me to the king, and I’ll explain the dream’s meaning to him.”
DAN.2.25	 Arioch immediately took Daniel to the king. He told the king, “I’ve found one of the captives from Judah who can explain the dream’s meaning to you, Your Majesty.”
DAN.2.26	 The king asked Daniel (who had been renamed Belteshazzar), “Can you tell me the dream I had and its meaning?”
DAN.2.27	 Daniel answered the king, “No wise adviser, psychic, magician, or fortuneteller can tell the king this secret. 
DAN.2.28	 But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets. He will tell King Nebuchadnezzar what is going to happen in the days to come. This is your dream, the vision you had while you were asleep: 
DAN.2.29	 Your Majesty, while you were lying in bed, thoughts about what would happen in the future came to you. The one who reveals secrets told you what is going to happen. 
DAN.2.30	 This secret wasn’t revealed to me because I’m wiser than anyone else. It was revealed so that you could be told the meaning and so that you would know your innermost thoughts.
DAN.2.31	 “Your Majesty, you had a vision. You saw a large statue. This statue was very bright. It stood in front of you, and it looked terrifying. 
DAN.2.32	 The head of this statue was made of fine gold. Its chest and arms were made of silver. Its stomach and hips were made of bronze. 
DAN.2.33	 Its legs were made of iron. Its feet were made partly of iron and partly of clay. 
DAN.2.34	 While you were watching, a stone was cut out, but not by humans. It struck the statue’s iron-and-clay feet and smashed them. 
DAN.2.35	 Then all at once, the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were smashed. They became like husks on a threshing floor 
DAN.2.36	 This is the dream. Now we’ll tell you its meaning.
DAN.2.37	 “Your Majesty, you are the greatest king. The God of heaven has given you a kingdom. He has given you power, strength, and honor. 
DAN.2.38	 He has given you control over people, wild animals, and birds, wherever they live. He has made you ruler of them all. You are the head of gold. 
DAN.2.39	 Another kingdom, inferior to yours, will rise to power after you. Then there will be a third kingdom, a kingdom of bronze, that will rule the whole world. 
DAN.2.40	 There will also be a fourth kingdom. It will be as strong as iron. (Iron smashes and shatters everything.) As iron crushes things, this fourth kingdom will smash and crush all the other kingdoms. 
DAN.2.41	 You also saw the feet and toes. They were partly potters’ clay and partly iron. This means that there will be a divided kingdom which has some of the firmness of iron. As you saw, iron was mixed with clay. 
DAN.2.42	 The toes were partly iron and partly clay. Part of the kingdom will be strong, and part will be brittle. 
DAN.2.43	 As you saw, iron was mixed with clay. So the two parts of the kingdom will mix by intermarrying, but they will not hold together any more than iron can mix with clay.
DAN.2.44	 “At the time of those kings, the God of heaven will establish a kingdom that will never be destroyed. No other people will be permitted to rule it. It will smash all the other kingdoms and put an end to them. But it will be established forever. 
DAN.2.45	 This is the stone that you saw cut out from a mountain, but not by humans. It smashed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. The great God has told you what will happen in the future, Your Majesty. The dream is true, and you can trust that this is its meaning.”
DAN.2.46	 King Nebuchadnezzar immediately bowed down on the ground in front of Daniel. He ordered that gifts and offerings be given to Daniel. 
DAN.2.47	 The king said to Daniel, “Your God is truly the greatest of gods, the Lord over kings. He can reveal secrets because you were able to reveal this secret.”
DAN.2.48	 Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many wonderful gifts. Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel governor of the whole province of Babylon and head of all Babylon’s wise advisers. 
DAN.2.49	 With the king’s permission, Daniel appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to govern the province of Babylon. But Daniel stayed at the king’s court.
DAN.3.1	 King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue 90 feet high and 9 feet wide. He set it up in a recessed area in the wall 
DAN.3.2	 King Nebuchadnezzar sent messengers to assemble the satraps, governors, mayors, military advisers, treasurers, judges, officers, and all the other provincial officials to dedicate the statue he had set up. 
DAN.3.3	 Then the satraps, governors, mayors, military advisers, treasurers, judges, officers, and all the other provincial officials assembled to dedicate the statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. They stood in front of the statue.
DAN.3.4	 The herald called out loudly, “People of every province, nation, and language! 
DAN.3.5	 When you hear the sound of rams’ horns, flutes, lyres, harps, and three-stringed harps playing at the same time with all other kinds of instruments, bow down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 
DAN.3.6	 Whoever doesn’t bow down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.” 
DAN.3.7	 As soon as they heard the sound of rams’ horns, flutes, lyres, harps, and three-stringed harps with all other kinds of instruments, all the people from every province, nation, and language bowed down and worshiped the gold statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
DAN.3.8	 After that happened, some astrologers came forward and brought charges against the Jews. 
DAN.3.9	 They addressed King Nebuchadnezzar, “Your Majesty, may you live forever! 
DAN.3.10	 Your Majesty, you gave an order that everyone who hears the sound of rams’ horns, flutes, lyres, harps, and three-stringed harps playing at the same time with all other kinds of instruments should bow down and worship the gold statue. 
DAN.3.11	 ⌊Your order said that⌋ whoever doesn’t bow down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.12	 There are certain Jews whom you appointed to govern the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men didn’t obey your order, Your Majesty. They don’t honor your gods or worship the statue that you set up.”
DAN.3.13	 Then, in a fit of rage and anger, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Immediately, they were brought to the king. 
DAN.3.14	 Nebuchadnezzar asked them, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you don’t honor my gods or worship the gold statue that I set up? 
DAN.3.15	 When you hear the sound of the rams’ horns, flutes, lyres, harps, and three-stringed harps playing at the same time with all other kinds of instruments, will you bow down and worship the gold statue I made? If you don’t worship it, you will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace. What god can save you from my power then?”
DAN.3.16	 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered King Nebuchadnezzar, “We don’t need to answer your last question. 
DAN.3.17	 If our God, whom we honor, can save us from a blazing furnace and from your power, he will, Your Majesty. 
DAN.3.18	 But if he doesn’t, you should know, Your Majesty, we’ll never honor your gods or worship the gold statue that you set up.”
DAN.3.19	 Nebuchadnezzar was so filled with anger toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face turned red. He ordered that the furnace should be heated seven times hotter than normal. 
DAN.3.20	 He told some soldiers from his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego so that they could be thrown into the blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.21	 Then the three men were thrown into the blazing furnace. They were wearing their clothes, hats, and other clothing. 
DAN.3.22	 The king’s order was so urgent and the furnace was so extremely hot that the men who carried Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were killed by the flames from the fire. 
DAN.3.23	 So these three men—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—fell into the blazing furnace. They were still tied up.
DAN.3.24	 Then Nebuchadnezzar was startled. He sprang to his feet. He asked his advisers, “Didn’t we throw three men into the fire?”
DAN.3.24	“That’s true, Your Majesty,” they answered.
DAN.3.25	 The king replied, “But look, I see four men. They’re untied, walking in the middle of the fire, and unharmed. The fourth one looks like a son of the gods.”
DAN.3.26	 Then Nebuchadnezzar went to the door of the blazing furnace and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—servants of the Most High God—come out here.”
DAN.3.26	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire. 
DAN.3.27	 The king’s satraps, governors, mayors, and advisers gathered around the three men. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies. The hair on their heads wasn’t singed, their clothes weren’t burned, and they didn’t smell of smoke.
DAN.3.28	 Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He sent his angel and saved his servants, who trusted him. They disobeyed the king and risked their lives so that they would not have to honor or worship any god except their own God. 
DAN.3.29	 So I order that people from every province, nation, or language who say anything slanderous about the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be torn limb from limb. Their houses will be turned into piles of rubble. No other god can rescue like this.”
DAN.3.30	 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to higher positions in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	 From King Nebuchadnezzar.
DAN.4.1	To the people of every province, nation, and language in the world.
DAN.4.1	I wish you peace and prosperity.
DAN.4.2	 I am pleased to write to you about the miraculous signs and amazing things the Most High God did for me.
DAN.4.3	 His miraculous signs are impressive.
DAN.4.3	He uses his power to do amazing things.
DAN.4.3	His kingdom is an eternal kingdom.
DAN.4.3	His power lasts from one generation to the next.
DAN.4.4	 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living comfortably at home. I was prosperous while living in my palace. 
DAN.4.5	 I had a dream that terrified me. The visions I had while I was asleep frightened me. 
DAN.4.6	 So I ordered all the wise advisers in Babylon to be brought to me to tell me the dream’s meaning. 
DAN.4.7	 The magicians, psychics, astrologers, and fortunetellers came to me. I told them the dream, but they couldn’t tell me its meaning. 
DAN.4.8	 Finally, Daniel came to me. (He had been renamed Belteshazzar after my god ⌊Bel⌋.) The spirit of the holy gods is in him.
DAN.4.8	I told him the dream: 
DAN.4.9	 “Belteshazzar, head of the magicians, I know the spirit of the holy gods is in you. No secret is too hard for you ⌊to uncover⌋. Tell me the meaning of the visions I had in my dream. 
DAN.4.10	 These are the visions I had while I was asleep: I was looking, and I saw an oak tree in the middle of the earth. It was very tall. 
DAN.4.11	 The tree grew, and it became strong enough and tall enough to reach the sky. It could be seen everywhere on earth. 
DAN.4.12	 It had beautiful leaves and plenty of fruit, enough to feed everyone. Wild animals found shade under it. Birds came to live in its branches. It fed every living creature.
DAN.4.13	 “I was seeing these visions as I was asleep. I saw a guardian, a holy being, come down from heaven. 
DAN.4.14	 He shouted loudly, ‘Cut down the oak tree! Cut off its branches! Strip off its leaves! Scatter its fruit! Make the animals under it run away, and make the birds fly from its branches. 
DAN.4.15	 But leave the stump and its roots in the ground. Secure it with an iron and bronze chain in the grass in the field. Let it get wet with the dew from the sky. And let it get its share of the plants on the ground with the animals. 
DAN.4.16	 Let its human mind be changed, and give it the mind of an animal. Let it remain like this for seven time periods. 
DAN.4.17	 The guardians have announced this decision. The holy ones have announced this so that every living creature will know that the Most High has power over human kingdoms. He gives them to whomever he wishes. He can place the lowest of people in charge of them.’ ”
DAN.4.18	 ⌊I said,⌋ “This is the dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell me its meaning because the wise advisers in my kingdom can’t tell it to me. However, you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
DAN.4.19	 Then Daniel (who had been renamed Belteshazzar) was momentarily stunned. What he was thinking frightened him. I told him, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream and its meaning frighten you.”
DAN.4.19	Belteshazzar answered, “Sir, I wish that the dream were about those who hate you and its meaning were about your enemies. 
DAN.4.20	 You saw an oak tree grow and become strong enough and tall enough to reach the sky. It could be seen everywhere on earth. 
DAN.4.21	 It had beautiful leaves and plenty of fruit, enough to feed everyone. Wild animals lived under it, and birds made their homes in its branches. 
DAN.4.22	 You are that tree, Your Majesty. You grew and became strong and mighty until you reached the sky. Your power reaches the most distant part of the world. 
DAN.4.23	 You saw a guardian, a holy being, come down from heaven. He said, ‘Cut down the oak tree! Destroy it! But leave the stump and its roots in the ground. Secure it with an iron and bronze chain in the grass in the field. Let it get wet with the dew from the sky. Let it get its share of the plants on the ground with the wild animals for seven time periods.’
DAN.4.24	 “This is the meaning, Your Majesty. The Most High has decided to apply it to you, Your Majesty. 
DAN.4.25	 You will be forced away from people and live with the wild animals. You will eat grass like cattle. The dew from the sky will make you wet. And seven time periods will pass until you realize that the Most High has power over human kingdoms and that he gives them to whomever he wishes. 
DAN.4.26	 Since I said that the stump and the tree’s roots were to be left, your kingdom will be restored to you as soon as you realize that heaven rules.
DAN.4.27	 “That is why, Your Majesty, my best advice is that you stop sinning, and do what is right. Stop committing the same errors, and have pity on the poor. Maybe you can prolong your prosperity.”
DAN.4.28	 All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.4.29	 Twelve months later, he was walking around the royal palace in Babylon. 
DAN.4.30	 The king thought, “Look how great Babylon is! I built the royal palace by my own impressive power and for my glorious honor.” 
DAN.4.31	 Before the words came out of his mouth, a voice said from heaven, “King Nebuchadnezzar, listen to this: The kingdom has been taken from you. 
DAN.4.32	 You will be forced away from people and live with the wild animals. You will eat grass like cattle. And seven time periods will pass until you realize that the Most High has power over human kingdoms and that he gives them to whomever he wishes.” 
DAN.4.33	 Just then the prediction about Nebuchadnezzar came true. He was forced away from people and ate grass like cattle. Dew from the sky made his body wet until his hair grew as long as eagles’ feathers and his nails grew as long as birds’ claws.
DAN.4.34	 At the end of the seven time periods, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my mind came back to me. I thanked the Most High, and I praised and honored the one who lives forever, because his power lasts forever and his kingdom lasts from one generation to the next. 
DAN.4.35	 Everyone who lives on earth is nothing compared to him. He does whatever he wishes with the army of heaven and with those who live on earth. There is no one who can oppose him or ask him, “What are you doing?”
DAN.4.36	 Just then my mind came back to me. My royal honor and glory were also given back to me. My advisers and nobles wanted to meet with me ⌊again⌋. I was given back my kingdom and made extraordinarily great. 
DAN.4.37	 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, will praise, honor, and give glory to the King of Heaven. Everything he does is true, his ways are right, and he can humiliate those who act arrogantly.
DAN.5.1	 King Belshazzar threw a large banquet for 1,000 nobles and drank wine with them. 
DAN.5.2	 As they were tasting the wine, Belshazzar ordered that the gold and silver utensils which his grandfather Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem be brought to him. He wanted to drink from them with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines.
DAN.5.3	 So the servants brought the gold utensils that had been taken from God’s temple in Jerusalem. The king, his nobles, wives, and concubines drank from them. 
DAN.5.4	 They drank the wine and praised their gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, or stone.
DAN.5.5	 Suddenly, the fingers of a person’s hand appeared and wrote on the plaster wall opposite the lamp stand of the royal palace. The king watched as the hand wrote. 
DAN.5.6	 Then the king turned pale, and his thoughts frightened him. His hip joints became loose, and his knees knocked against each other.
DAN.5.7	 The king screamed for the psychics, astrologers, and fortunetellers to be brought to him. He told these wise advisers of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and tells me its meaning will be dressed in purple, wear a gold chain on his neck, and become the third-highest ruler in the kingdom.” 
DAN.5.8	 All the king’s wise advisers came, but they couldn’t read the writing or tell the king its meaning. 
DAN.5.9	 King Belshazzar was terrified, and his face turned pale. His nobles didn’t know what to do.
DAN.5.10	 The discussion between the king and his nobles brought the queen herself into the banquet hall. The queen said, “Your Majesty, may you live forever! Don’t let your thoughts frighten you, and don’t turn pale. 
DAN.5.11	 There’s a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your grandfather, he was found to have insight, good judgment, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods. Your grandfather, King Nebuchadnezzar, made him head of the magicians, psychics, astrologers, and fortunetellers. 
DAN.5.12	 This Daniel (who had been renamed Belteshazzar) was found to have knowledge, judgment, and an extraordinary spirit. He has the ability to interpret dreams, solve riddles, and untangle problems. Now, call Daniel, and he will tell ⌊you⌋ what it means.”
DAN.5.13	 So Daniel was taken to the king. The king asked him, “Are you Daniel, one of the captives that my grandfather brought from Judah? 
DAN.5.14	 I’ve heard that you have the spirit of the gods and that you have insight, good judgment, and extraordinary wisdom. 
DAN.5.15	 The wise advisers and the psychics were brought to me to read this writing and tell me its meaning. But they couldn’t tell me its meaning. 
DAN.5.16	 I have heard that you can interpret such things and untangle problems. If you can read the writing and tell ⌊me⌋ its meaning, you will be dressed in purple, wear a gold chain on your neck, and become the third-highest ruler in the kingdom.”
DAN.5.17	 Daniel told the king, “Keep your gifts. Give your gifts and awards to someone else. I’ll still read the writing for you and tell you its meaning.
DAN.5.18	 “Your Majesty, the Most High God gave your grandfather Nebuchadnezzar a kingdom, might, honor, and glory. 
DAN.5.19	 People from every province, nation, and language trembled and were terrified by him, because God gave him power. Nebuchadnezzar killed whomever he wanted to kill, and he kept alive whomever he wanted to keep alive. He promoted whomever he wanted to promote, and he demoted whomever he wanted to demote. 
DAN.5.20	 But when he became so arrogant and conceited that he became overconfident, he was removed from the royal throne. His honor was taken away from him. 
DAN.5.21	 He was chased away from people, and his mind was changed into an animal’s mind. He lived with wild donkeys, ate grass like cattle, and his body became wet with dew from the sky. This happened until he realized that the Most High God has power over human kingdoms. God puts whomever he wishes in charge of them.
DAN.5.22	 “Belshazzar, you are one of Nebuchadnezzar’s successors. You didn’t remain humble, even though you knew all this. 
DAN.5.23	 But you made yourself greater than the Lord of heaven. You had the utensils from his temple brought to you. You, your nobles, wives, and concubines drank wine from them. You praised your gods made of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, or stone. These gods can’t see, hear, or know anything. You didn’t honor God, who has power over your life and everything you do. 
DAN.5.24	 So he sent the hand to write this inscription. 
DAN.5.25	 This is what has been written: Numbered, Numbered, Weighed, and Divided. 
DAN.5.26	 This is its meaning: Numbered—God has numbered the days of your kingdom and will bring it to an end. 
DAN.5.27	 Weighed—you have been weighed on a scale and found to be too light. 
DAN.5.28	 Divided—your kingdom will be divided and given to the Medes and Persians.” 
DAN.5.29	 Then Belshazzar ordered that Daniel be dressed in purple and wear a gold chain on his neck. He made Daniel the third-highest ruler in the kingdom. 
DAN.5.30	 That night King Belshazzar of Babylon was killed.
DAN.5.31	 Darius the Mede took over the kingdom. He was 62 years old.
DAN.6.1	 Darius decided it would be good to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom. 
DAN.6.2	 Over these satraps were three officials. Daniel was one of these officials. The satraps were to report to these three officials so that the king wouldn’t be cheated.
DAN.6.3	 This man, Daniel, distinguished himself among the other officials and satraps because there was an extraordinary spirit in him. The king thought about putting him in charge of the whole kingdom. 
DAN.6.4	 So the other officials and satraps tried to find something to accuse Daniel of in his duties for the kingdom. But they couldn’t find anything wrong because he was trustworthy. No error or fault could be found. 
DAN.6.5	 These men said, “We won’t find anything to accuse this man, Daniel, unless we find it in his religious practices.”
DAN.6.6	 So these officials and satraps went to the king as a group. They said to him, “May King Darius live forever! 
DAN.6.7	 All the officials, governors, satraps, advisers, and mayors agree that the king should make a statute and enforce a decree. The decree should state that for the next 30 days whoever asks for anything from any god or person except you, Your Majesty, will be thrown into a lions’ den. 
DAN.6.8	 Your Majesty, issue this decree, and sign it. According to the law of the Medes and Persians no one could change it or repeal it.” 
DAN.6.9	 So Darius signed the written decree.
DAN.6.10	 When Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went to his house. An upper room in his house had windows that opened in the direction of Jerusalem. Three times each day he got down on his knees and prayed to his God. He had always praised God this way.
DAN.6.11	 One of those times the men came in as a group and found Daniel praying and pleading to his God. 
DAN.6.12	 Then they went and spoke to the king about his decree. ⌊They asked,⌋ “Didn’t you sign a decree which stated that for 30 days whoever asks for anything from any god or person except you, Your Majesty, will be thrown into a lions’ den?”
DAN.6.12	The king answered, “That’s true. According to the law of the Medes and Persians the decree can’t be repealed.”
DAN.6.13	 They replied, “Your Majesty, Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, refuses to obey your order or the decree that you signed. He prays three times each day.”
DAN.6.14	 The king was very displeased when he heard this. He tried every way he could think of to save Daniel. Until sundown he did everything he could to rescue him.
DAN.6.15	 Then Daniel’s accusers gathered in front of the king. They said to him, “Remember, Your Majesty, the Medes and Persians have a law that no decree or statute the king makes can be changed.”
DAN.6.16	 So the king gave the order, and Daniel was brought to him and thrown into the lions’ den. The king told Daniel, “May your God, whom you always worship, save you!”
DAN.6.17	 A stone was brought and placed over the opening of the den. The king put his seal on the stone, using his ring and the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel’s situation could not be changed.
DAN.6.18	 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night without food or company. He couldn’t get to sleep. 
DAN.6.19	 At dawn, as soon as it was light, the king got up and quickly went to the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.20	 As he came near the den where Daniel was, the king called to Daniel with anguish in his voice, “Daniel, servant of the living God! Was God, whom you always worship, able to save you from the lions?”
DAN.6.21	 Daniel said to the king, “Your Majesty, may you live forever! 
DAN.6.22	 My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths so that they couldn’t hurt me. He did this because he considered me innocent. Your Majesty, I haven’t committed any crime.”
DAN.6.23	 The king was overjoyed and had Daniel taken out of the den. When Daniel was taken out of the den, people saw that he was completely unharmed because he trusted his God.
DAN.6.24	 The king ordered those men who had brought charges against Daniel to be brought to him. They, their wives, and their children were thrown into the lions’ den. Before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions attacked them and crushed all their bones.
DAN.6.25	 Then King Darius wrote to the people of every province, nation, and language all over the world:
DAN.6.25	I wish you peace and prosperity.
DAN.6.26	 I decree that in every part of my kingdom people should tremble with terror in front of Daniel’s God, the living God who continues forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed. His power lasts to the end ⌊of time⌋. 
DAN.6.27	 He saves, rescues, and does miraculous signs and amazing things in heaven and on earth. He saved Daniel from the lions.
DAN.6.28	 This man, Daniel, prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
DAN.7.1	 In Belshazzar’s first year as king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream. He saw a vision while he was asleep. He wrote down the main parts of the dream.
DAN.7.2	 In my visions at night I, Daniel, saw the four winds of heaven stirring up the Mediterranean Sea. 
DAN.7.3	 Four large animals, each one different from the others, came out of the sea.
DAN.7.4	 The first animal was like a lion, but it had wings like an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked off and it was lifted off the ground. It was made to stand on two feet like a human and was given a human mind.
DAN.7.5	 I saw a second animal. It looked like a bear. It was raised on one side and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, “Get up, and eat as much meat as you want.”
DAN.7.6	 After this, I saw another animal. It looked like a leopard. On its back it had four wings, like the wings of a bird. The animal also had four heads. It was given power to rule.
DAN.7.7	 After this, I saw a fourth animal in my vision during the night. It was terrifying, dreadful, extraordinarily strong, and had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed its victims and trampled whatever was left. It acted differently from all the other animals that I had seen before. It had ten horns. 
DAN.7.8	 While I was thinking about the horns, another horn, a little horn, came up among them. It uprooted three of the other horns. This horn had eyes like human eyes and a mouth that spoke impressive things.
DAN.7.9	 I watched until thrones were set up
DAN.7.9	and the Ancient One, who has lived for endless years, sat down.
DAN.7.9	His clothes were as white as snow
DAN.7.9	and the hair on his head was like pure wool.
DAN.7.9	His throne was fiery flames,
DAN.7.9	and its wheels were burning fire.
DAN.7.10	 A river of fire flowed.
DAN.7.10	It came from him.
DAN.7.10	Thousands and thousands served him.
DAN.7.10	Ten thousand times ten thousand were stationed in front of him.
DAN.7.10	The court convened,
DAN.7.10	and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	 I continued to watch because of the impressive words that the horn was speaking. I watched until the animal was killed. Its body was destroyed and put into a raging fire. 
DAN.7.12	 The power of the rest of the animals was taken away, but they were allowed to live for a period of time.
DAN.7.13	 In my visions during the night, I saw among the clouds in heaven someone like the Son of Man.
DAN.7.14	 He was given power, honor, and a kingdom. People from every province, nation, and language were to serve him. His power is an eternal power that will not be taken away. His kingdom will never be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	 I, Daniel, was deeply troubled, and my visions frightened me. 
DAN.7.16	 I went to someone who was standing there and asked him to tell me the truth about all this. So he told me what all this meant. 
DAN.7.17	 He said, “These four large animals are four kingdoms that will rise to power on the earth. 
DAN.7.18	 But the holy people of the Most High will take possession of the kingdom and keep it forever and ever.”
DAN.7.19	 Then I wanted to know the truth about the fourth animal, which was so different from all the others. It was very terrifying and had iron teeth and bronze claws. It devoured and crushed its victims, and trampled whatever was left. 
DAN.7.20	 I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that had come up and made three of the horns fall out. That horn had eyes and a mouth that spoke impressive things. It appeared to be bigger than the others. 
DAN.7.21	 I saw that horn making war against the holy people and defeating them. 
DAN.7.22	 It did this until the Ancient One, who has lived for endless years, came and judged in favor of the holy people of the Most High. The time came when the holy people took possession of the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	 He said, “The fourth animal will be the fourth of these kingdoms on earth. It will be different from all other kingdoms. It will devour, trample, and crush the whole world. 
DAN.7.24	 The ten horns are ten kings that will rise to power from that kingdom. Another king will rise to power after them. He will be different from the kings who came before him, and he will humble three kings. 
DAN.7.25	 He will speak against the Most High God, oppress the holy people of the Most High, and plan to change the appointed times and laws. The holy people will be handed over to him for a time, times, and half of a time. 
DAN.7.26	 But judgment will be handed down, his power will be taken away, and he will be completely and permanently destroyed. 
DAN.7.27	 The kingdom, along with the power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven, will be given to the holy people of the Most High. Their kingdom is eternal. All other powers will serve and obey them.”
DAN.7.28	 Here is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was terrified by my thoughts, and I turned pale. I kept this to myself.
DAN.8.1	 In Belshazzar’s third year as king, I, Daniel, saw a vision. This vision came after the one I saw earlier. 
DAN.8.2	 In my vision I saw myself in the fortress of Susa in the province of Elam. In my vision I saw myself at Ulai Gate. 
DAN.8.3	 I looked up and saw a single ram standing beside the gate. The ram had two long horns, one longer than the other, though the longer one had grown up later. 
DAN.8.4	 I saw the ram charging west, north, and south. No other animal could stand in front of it, and no one could escape from its power. It did anything it pleased and continued to grow.
DAN.8.5	 As I was watching closely, I saw a male goat coming from the west. It crossed the whole earth without touching it. This goat had a prominent horn between its eyes. 
DAN.8.6	 The goat was coming toward the two-horned ram that I had seen standing beside the gate. It furiously ran at the ram. 
DAN.8.7	 I saw it come closer to the ram. The goat was extremely angry with the ram, so it attacked the ram. It broke both of the ram’s horns. The ram didn’t have the strength to stand up against the goat. So the ram was thrown down on the ground and trampled. No one could rescue the ram from the goat’s power.
DAN.8.8	 The male goat became very important. But when the goat became powerful, his large horn broke off. In its place grew four horns. They corresponded to the four winds of heaven. 
DAN.8.9	 Out of one of the horns came a small horn. It gained power over the south, the east, and the beautiful land. 
DAN.8.10	 It continued to gain power until it reached the army of heaven. It threw some of the army of heaven, the stars, down on the ground and trampled them. 
DAN.8.11	 Then it attacked the commander of the army so that it took the daily burnt offering from him and wrecked his holy place. 
DAN.8.12	 In its rebelliousness it was given an army to put a stop to the daily burnt offering. It threw truth on the ground. The horn was successful in everything it did.
DAN.8.13	 Then I heard a holy one speaking. Another holy one said to the one who was speaking, “How long will the things in this vision—the daily burnt offering, the destructive rebellion, the surrender of the holy place, and the trampling of the army—take place?”
DAN.8.14	 He told me, “For 2,300 evenings and mornings. Then the holy place will be made acceptable to God.”
DAN.8.15	 Now as I, Daniel, watched the vision and tried to understand it, I saw someone who looked like a man standing in front of me. 
DAN.8.16	 I heard a man in Ulai ⌊Gate⌋ call loudly, “Gabriel, explain the vision to this man.”
DAN.8.17	 Gabriel came up beside me, and when he came, I was terrified and immediately knelt down.
DAN.8.17	He said to me, “Son of man, understand that the vision is about the end times.” 
DAN.8.18	 As he spoke to me, I fainted facedown on the ground, but he touched me and made me stand up. 
DAN.8.19	 He said, “I will tell you what will happen in the last days, ⌊the time of God’s⌋ anger, because the end time has been determined.
DAN.8.20	 “The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kingdoms of Media and Persia. 
DAN.8.21	 The hairy male goat is the kingdom of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is its first king. 
DAN.8.22	 The horn broke off, and four horns replaced it. Four kingdoms will come out of that nation, but they won’t be as strong as the first king was.
DAN.8.23	 “In the last days of those kingdoms, when rebellions are finished, a stern-looking king who understands mysterious things will rise to power. 
DAN.8.24	 He will become very strong, but not by his own strength. He will cause astounding destruction and will be successful in everything he does. He will destroy those who are powerful along with some holy people. 
DAN.8.25	 He will cleverly use his power to deceive others successfully. He will consider himself to be great and destroy many people when they don’t expect it. He will oppose the Commander of Commanders, but he will be defeated, though not by any human power. 
DAN.8.26	 The vision about the ⌊2,300⌋ evenings and mornings that was explained to you is true. Seal the vision, because it is about things that will happen in the distant future.”
DAN.8.27	 I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up and worked for the king. The vision horrified me because I couldn’t understand it.
DAN.9.1	 Xerxes’ son Darius, who was a Mede by birth, was made ruler of the kingdom of Babylon. 
DAN.9.2	 In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, learned from the Scriptures the number of years that Jerusalem would remain in ruins. The L
DAN.9.3	 So I turned to the Lord God and looked to him for help. I prayed, pleaded, and fasted in sackcloth and ashes.
DAN.9.4	 I prayed to the L
DAN.9.5	 We have sinned, done wrong, acted wickedly, rebelled, and turned away from your commandments and laws. 
DAN.9.6	 We haven’t listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, leaders, ancestors, and all the common people. 
DAN.9.7	 You, Lord, are righteous. But we—the men of Judah, the citizens of Jerusalem, and all the Israelites whom you scattered in countries near and far—are still ashamed because we have been unfaithful to you. 
DAN.9.8	 We, our kings, leaders, and ancestors are ashamed because we have sinned against you, L
DAN.9.9	 “But you, Lord our God, are compassionate and forgiving, although we have rebelled against you. 
DAN.9.10	 We never listened to you or lived by the teachings you gave us through your servants the prophets. 
DAN.9.11	 All Israel has ignored your teachings and refused to listen to you. So you brought on us the curses you swore in an oath, the curses written in the Teachings of your servant Moses. We sinned against you. 
DAN.9.12	 So you did what you said you would do to us and our rulers by bringing a great disaster on us. Nowhere in the world has anything ever happened like what has happened to Jerusalem. 
DAN.9.13	 This entire disaster happened to us, exactly as it was written in Moses’ Teachings. L
DAN.9.14	 So you were prepared to bring this disaster on us. L
DAN.9.15	 “Lord our God, you brought your people out of Egypt with your strong hand and made yourself famous even today. We have sinned and done evil things. 
DAN.9.16	 Lord, since you are very righteous, turn your anger and fury away from your city, Jerusalem, your holy mountain. Jerusalem and your people are insulted by everyone around us because of our sins and the wicked things our ancestors did.
DAN.9.17	 “Our God, listen to my prayer and request. For your own sake, Lord, look favorably on your holy place, which is lying in ruins. 
DAN.9.18	 Open your ears and listen, my God. Open your eyes and look at our ruins and at the city called by your name. We are not requesting this from you because we are righteous, but because you are very compassionate. 
DAN.9.19	 Listen to us, Lord. Forgive us, Lord. Pay attention, and act. Don’t delay! Do this for your sake, my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.”
DAN.9.20	 I continued to pray, confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel. I humbly placed my request about my God’s holy mountain in front of the L
DAN.9.21	 While I was praying, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the first vision, came to me about the time of the evening sacrifice. He was exhausted. 
DAN.9.22	 He informed me, “Daniel, this time I have come to give you insight. 
DAN.9.23	 As soon as you began to make your request, a reply was sent. I have come to give you the reply because you are highly respected. So study the message, and understand the vision.
DAN.9.24	 “Seventy sets of seven time periods have been assigned for your people and your holy city. These time periods will serve to bring an end to rebellion, to stop sin, to forgive wrongs, to usher in everlasting righteousness, to put a seal on a prophet’s vision, and to anoint the Most Holy One. 
DAN.9.25	 Learn, then, and understand that from the time the command is given to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the anointed prince comes, seven sets of seven time periods and sixty-two sets of seven time periods will pass. Jerusalem will be restored and rebuilt with a city square and a moat during the troubles of those times. 
DAN.9.26	 But after the sixty-two sets of seven time periods, the Anointed One 
DAN.9.27	 He will confirm his promise with many for one set of seven time periods. In the middle of the seven time periods, he will stop the sacrifices and food offerings. This will happen along with disgusting things that cause destruction until ⌊those time periods⌋ come to an end. It has been determined that this will happen to those who destroy ⌊the city⌋.”
DAN.10.1	 In Cyrus’ third year as king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel (who had been renamed Belteshazzar). The message was true. It was about a great war. Daniel understood the message because he was given insight during the vision.
DAN.10.2	 During those days I, Daniel, mourned for three whole weeks. 
DAN.10.3	 I didn’t eat any good-tasting food. No meat or wine entered my mouth. I didn’t wash myself until the entire three weeks were over.
DAN.10.4	 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was by the great Tigris River. 
DAN.10.5	 When I looked up, I saw a man dressed in linen, and he had a belt made of gold from Uphaz around his waist. 
DAN.10.6	 His body was like beryl. His face looked like lightning. His eyes were like flaming torches. His arms and legs looked like polished bronze. When he spoke, his voice sounded like the roar of a crowd. 
DAN.10.7	 I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision. The men with me didn’t see the vision. Yet, they started to tremble violently, and they quickly hid themselves. 
DAN.10.8	 So I was left alone to see this grand vision. I had no strength left in me. My face turned deathly pale, and I was helpless. 
DAN.10.9	 I heard the man speak, and as I listened to his words, I fainted facedown on the ground.
DAN.10.10	 Then a hand touched me and made my hands and knees shake. 
DAN.10.11	 The man said to me, “Daniel, you are highly respected. Pay attention to my words. Stand up, because I’ve been sent to you.” When he said this to me, I stood up, trembling. 
DAN.10.12	 He told me, “Don’t be afraid, Daniel. God has heard everything that you said ever since the first day you decided to humble yourself in front of your God so that you could learn to understand things. I have come in response to your prayer. 
DAN.10.13	 The commander of the Persian kingdom opposed me for 21 days. But then Michael, one of the chief commanders, came to help me because I was left alone with the kings of Persia. 
DAN.10.14	 I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the last days, because the vision is about times still to come.”
DAN.10.15	 When he said this to me, I bowed down with my face touching the ground and was silent. 
DAN.10.16	 Then someone who looked like a human touched my lips. I opened my mouth and began to talk. I said to the person standing in front of me, “Sir, because of this vision, pain has overwhelmed me, and I’m helpless. 
DAN.10.17	 How can I talk to you, sir? I have no strength left, and the wind has been knocked out of me.”
DAN.10.18	 Again, the person who looked like a human touched me, and I became stronger. 
DAN.10.19	 He said, “Don’t be afraid. You are highly respected. Everything is alright! Be strong! Be strong!”

Then there will be a fourth, who will become much richer than all the others. As he becomes strong through his wealth, he will turn everyone against the kingdom of Greece.
DAN.11.3	 “Then a warrior-king will come. He will rule a vast empire and do as he pleases. 
DAN.11.4	 But as soon as he is established, his kingdom will be broken into pieces and divided in the directions of the four winds of heaven. The empire will not be given to his descendants. It will no longer be like his empire, since it will be uprooted and given to others.
DAN.11.5	 “The southern king will be strong, but one of his officers will become stronger than he is and rule a vast empire. 
DAN.11.6	 After a few years the southern and northern kings will make an alliance. The southern king’s daughter will go to the northern king to make peace. She won’t hold on to her power, and the alliance won’t last. She, those who came with her, and the one who fathered 
DAN.11.7	 “At that time a shoot will grow from her roots to replace her father. He will attack the northern army, enter the stronghold of the northern king, fight against them, and be victorious. 
DAN.11.8	 He will take the metal statues of their gods and their precious utensils of silver and gold back to Egypt. He will rule for more years than the northern king. 
DAN.11.9	 He will invade the southern kingdom and return to his own country.
DAN.11.10	 “Then his sons will prepare for war. They will assemble a large number of forces so that they can overwhelm ⌊the enemy⌋ and pass through its land. They will return and wage war all the way to the stronghold. 
DAN.11.11	 The southern king will be outraged. He will go to fight the northern king, who will raise a large army that will fall into the southern king’s hands. 
DAN.11.12	 When that army is captured, the southern king will become conceited. Although he will dominate tens of thousands of people, he will not always be strong.
DAN.11.13	 “The northern king will return and raise an army larger than the first one. After a few years he will invade with a large army and a lot of equipment. 
DAN.11.14	 In those times many people will rebel against the southern king, and violent men from your own people will rebel in keeping with this vision, but they will be defeated. 
DAN.11.15	 Then the northern king will come, build dirt attack ramps, and capture a fortified city. The southern forces will not be able to withstand him. Even their best troops will not be strong enough. 
DAN.11.16	 The invader will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to withstand his attack. He will rise to power in the beautiful land and it will be completely under his control.
DAN.11.17	 “Then the northern king will decide to invade with the power of his entire kingdom, and some decent men will invade with him. He will give the southern king his daughter as a wife in order to destroy the southern kingdom. But this will not succeed or help him. 
DAN.11.18	 Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and capture many of them. But a commander will silence the insults that the northern king makes and even insult him.
DAN.11.19	 He will turn back toward the fortresses in his own country, but he will stumble, fall, and disappear.
DAN.11.20	 “Another king will take his place. He will have a cruel official go out in royal splendor. But in a few days the king will be destroyed, although not in anger or war.
DAN.11.21	 “A contemptible person will take his place. He will not be given royal splendor. He will invade when people are feeling secure, and he will seize the kingdom using false promises. 
DAN.11.22	 He will overwhelm large forces and defeat them, including the prince of the promise.
DAN.11.23	 After an alliance has been made with him, he will act deceitfully and rise to power with only a few people. 
DAN.11.24	 When people feel secure, he will invade the richest parts of the provinces and do something that none of his predecessors ever did. He will distribute loot and wealth to his followers. He will invent new ways of attacking fortifications. But this will last only for a little while.
DAN.11.25	 “With a large army he will summon his power and courage against the southern king, who will prepare for war with a large, strong army. But the southern king won’t be able to withstand him because of the schemes devised against him. 
DAN.11.26	 People who eat the king’s rich food will ruin him. His army will be overwhelmed, and many will die in battle. 
DAN.11.27	 The two kings will both plan to do evil. They will sit at the same table and tell lies. But they will not succeed, because the end must wait until the appointed time. 
DAN.11.28	 The northern king will return to his country with a lot of wealth. He will be determined to fight against the holy promise. He will take action and return to his own country.
DAN.11.29	 “At the appointed time he will again invade the south, but this time will be different from the first. 
DAN.11.30	 Ships will come from the west to attack him, and he will be discouraged and turn back. Angry at the holy promise, he will return, take action, and favor those who abandon the holy promise. 
DAN.11.31	 His forces will dishonor the holy place (the fortress), take away the daily burnt offering, and set up the disgusting thing that causes destruction. 
DAN.11.32	 With flattery he will corrupt those who abandon the promise. But the people who know their God will be strong and take action.
DAN.11.33	 “People who are wise will help many to understand. But for some time they will be defeated by swords and flames. They will be captured and looted. 
DAN.11.34	 As they are being defeated, they will get a little help, but many who are not sincere will join them. 
DAN.11.35	 Some of the wise people will be defeated in order to refine, purify, and make them white until the end times. But the appointed time is still to come.
DAN.11.36	 “The king will do as he pleases. He will highly honor himself above every god. He will say amazing things against the God of gods. He will succeed until God’s anger is over, because what has been decided must be done. 
DAN.11.37	 He will have no interest in the gods of his ancestors or desire for women. He will have no interest in any god, because he will make himself greater than anyone else. 
DAN.11.38	 Instead, he will honor the god of fortresses. With gold, silver, precious stones, and other expensive things he will honor a god his ancestors never heard of. 
DAN.11.39	 With the help of a foreign god, he will deal with strong fortresses. He will give high honors to those who acknowledge him, make them rulers over many people, and distribute land for a price.
DAN.11.40	 “In the end times the southern king will attack him. The northern king will rush at him like a storm with chariots, horses, and many ships. He will invade countries, overwhelm them, and pass through their land. 
DAN.11.41	 He will invade the beautiful land, and tens of thousands will be defeated. But Edom, Moab, and the leaders of the Ammonites will escape from his power. 
DAN.11.42	 He will use his power against many countries. Even Egypt will not escape. 
DAN.11.43	 He will control gold and silver treasures and all Egypt’s treasuries. Libya and Sudan will surrender to him. 
DAN.11.44	 But news from the east and the north will frighten him. He will leave very angry to destroy and exterminate many. 
DAN.11.45	 He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at a beautiful holy mountain. When he comes to his end, there will be no one to help him.”
DAN.12.1	 ⌊The person who looked like a human continued,⌋ “At that time Michael, the great commander, will stand up on behalf of the descendants of your people. It will be a time of trouble unlike any that has existed from the time there have been nations until that time. But at that time your people, everyone written in the book, will be rescued. 
DAN.12.2	 Many sleeping in the ground will wake up. Some will wake up to live forever, but others will wake up to be ashamed and disgraced forever.

DAN.12.4	 “But you, Daniel, keep these words secret, and seal the book until the end times. Many will travel everywhere, and knowledge will grow.”
DAN.12.5	 When I, Daniel, looked up, I saw two men standing there. One man stood on one side of the river, and the other one stood on the other side. 
DAN.12.6	 One of them asked the man dressed in linen clothes who was above the river, “How long will it be until these miracles are over?” 
DAN.12.7	 I heard the man dressed in linen clothes who was above the river. He raised his right hand and left hand to heaven and swore an oath by the one who lives forever. He said, “It will be for a time, times, and half of a time. When the power of the holy people has been completely shattered, then all these things will be finished.”
DAN.12.8	 I heard him, but I did not understand. So I asked him, “Sir, how will these things end?”
DAN.12.9	 He replied, “Go, Daniel. These words are to be kept secret and sealed until the end times. 
DAN.12.10	 Many will be purified, made white, and refined. But wicked people will do wicked things, and none of them will understand. Only wise people will understand. 
DAN.12.11	 From the time the daily burnt offering is taken away and the disgusting thing that causes destruction is set up, there will be 1,290 days. 
DAN.12.12	 Blessed are those who wait until they reach 1,335 days.

AMO.7.8	I answered, “A plumb line.”
AMO.7.8	Then the Lord said, “I’m going to hold a plumb line in the middle of my people Israel. I will no longer overlook what they have done. 
AMO.7.9	 The worship sites of Isaac will be destroyed, and the holy places of Israel will be in ruins. I will attack Jeroboam’s heirs with my sword.”
AMO.7.10	 Then Amaziah, the priest at Bethel, sent a message to King Jeroboam of Israel. It read, “Amos is plotting against you among the people of Israel. The country isn’t able to endure everything he is saying. 
AMO.7.11	 Amos says that Jeroboam will be killed with a sword and that Israel cannot avoid being taken from its land into exile.”
AMO.7.12	 Then Amaziah said to Amos, “You seer,

MIC.4.3	Nations will never fight against each other,

MIC.5.6	They will rescue us from the Assyrians

MAT.1.1	 This is the list of ancestors of Jesus Christ, descendant of David and Abraham.
MAT.1.2	 Abraham was the father of Isaac,
MAT.1.2	Isaac the father of Jacob,
MAT.1.2	Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.
MAT.1.3	 Judah and Tamar were the father and mother of Perez and Zerah.
MAT.1.3	Perez was the father of Hezron,
MAT.1.3	Hezron the father of Ram,
MAT.1.4	 Ram the father of Amminadab,
MAT.1.4	Amminadab the father of Nahshon,
MAT.1.4	Nahshon the father of Salmon.
MAT.1.5	 Salmon and Rahab were the father and mother of Boaz.
MAT.1.5	Boaz and Ruth were the father and mother of Obed.
MAT.1.5	Obed was the father of Jesse,
MAT.1.6	 Jesse the father of King David.
MAT.1.6	David and Uriah’s wife ⌊Bathsheba⌋ were the father and mother of Solomon.
MAT.1.7	 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam,
MAT.1.7	Rehoboam the father of Abijah,
MAT.1.7	Abijah the father of Asa,
MAT.1.8	 Asa the father of Jehoshaphat,
MAT.1.8	Jehoshaphat the father of Joram,
MAT.1.8	Joram the father of Uzziah,
MAT.1.9	 Uzziah the father of Jotham,
MAT.1.9	Jotham the father of Ahaz,
MAT.1.9	Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
MAT.1.10	 Hezekiah the father of Manasseh,
MAT.1.10	Manasseh the father of Amon,
MAT.1.10	Amon the father of Josiah.
MAT.1.11	 Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers.
MAT.1.11	They lived at the time when the people were exiled to Babylon.
MAT.1.12	 After the exile to Babylon,
MAT.1.12	Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel.
MAT.1.12	Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel,
MAT.1.13	 Zerubbabel the father of Abiud,
MAT.1.13	Abiud the father of Eliakim,
MAT.1.13	Eliakim the father of Azor,
MAT.1.14	 Azor the father of Zadok,
MAT.1.14	Zadok the father of Achim,
MAT.1.14	Achim the father of Eliud,
MAT.1.15	 Eliud the father of Eleazar,
MAT.1.15	Eleazar the father of Matthan,
MAT.1.15	Matthan the father of Jacob.
MAT.1.16	 Jacob was the father of Joseph, who was the husband of Mary.
MAT.1.16	Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called Christ.
MAT.1.17	 So there were
MAT.1.17	14 generations from Abraham to David,
MAT.1.17	14 generations from David until the exile to Babylon,
MAT.1.17	14 generations from the exile until the Messiah.
MAT.1.18	 The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. His mother Mary had been promised to Joseph in marriage. But before they were married, Mary realized that she was pregnant by the Holy Spirit. 
MAT.1.19	 Her husband Joseph was an honorable man and did not want to disgrace her publicly. So he decided to break the marriage agreement with her secretly.
MAT.1.20	 Joseph had this in mind when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said to him, “Joseph, descendant of David, don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife. She is pregnant by the Holy Spirit. 
MAT.1.21	 She will give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus [He Saves], because he will save his people from their sins.” 
MAT.1.22	 All this happened so that what the Lord had spoken through the prophet came true: 
MAT.1.23	 “The virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel,” which means “God is with us.”
MAT.1.24	 When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him to do. He took Mary to be his wife. 
MAT.1.25	 He did not have marital relations with her before she gave birth to a son. Joseph named the child Jesus.
MAT.2.1	 Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea when Herod was king. After Jesus’ birth wise men 
MAT.2.2	 They asked, “Where is the one who was born to be the king of the Jews? We saw his star rising and have come to worship him.”
MAT.2.3	 When King Herod and all Jerusalem heard about this, they became disturbed. 
MAT.2.4	 He called together all the chief priests and the experts in the Scriptures and tried to find out from them where the Messiah was supposed to be born.
MAT.2.5	 They told him, “In Bethlehem in Judea. The prophet wrote about this:
MAT.2.6	 Bethlehem in the land of Judah,
MAT.2.6	you are by no means least among the leaders of Judah.
MAT.2.6	A leader will come from you.
MAT.2.6	He will shepherd my people Israel.”
MAT.2.7	 Then Herod secretly called the wise men and found out from them exactly when the star had appeared. 
MAT.2.8	 As he sent them to Bethlehem, he said, “Go and search carefully for the child. When you have found him, report to me so that I may go and worship him too.”
MAT.2.9	 After they had heard the king, they started out. The star they had seen rising led them until it stopped over the place where the child was. 
MAT.2.10	 They were overwhelmed with joy to see the star. 
MAT.2.11	 When they entered the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary. So they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
MAT.2.12	 God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they left for their country by another road.
MAT.2.13	 After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. The angel said to him, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and kill him.”
MAT.2.14	 Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and left for Egypt that night. 
MAT.2.15	 He stayed there until Herod died. What the Lord had spoken through the prophet came true: “I have called my son out of Egypt.”
MAT.2.16	 When Herod saw that the wise men had tricked him, he became furious. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys two years old and younger in or near Bethlehem. This matched the exact time he had learned from the wise men. 
MAT.2.17	 Then the words spoken through the prophet Jeremiah came true:
MAT.2.18	 “A sound was heard in Ramah,
MAT.2.18	the sound of crying in bitter grief.
MAT.2.18	Rachel was crying for her children.
MAT.2.18	She refused to be comforted
MAT.2.18	because they were dead.”
MAT.2.19	 After Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt. 
MAT.2.20	 The angel said to him, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to Israel. Those who tried to kill the child are dead.”
MAT.2.21	 Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to Israel. 
MAT.2.22	 But when he heard that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, Joseph was afraid to go there. Warned in a dream, he left for Galilee 
MAT.2.23	 and made his home in a city called Nazareth. So what the prophets had said came true: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
MAT.3.1	 Later, John the Baptizer appeared in the desert of Judea. His message was, 
MAT.3.2	 “Turn to God and change the way you think and act, because the kingdom of heaven is near.” 
MAT.3.3	 Isaiah the prophet spoke about this man when he said,
MAT.3.3	“A voice cries out in the desert:
MAT.3.3	‘Prepare the way for the Lord!
MAT.3.3	Make his paths straight!’ ”
MAT.3.4	 John wore clothes made from camel’s hair and had a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.
MAT.3.5	 Jerusalem, all Judea, and the whole Jordan Valley went to him. 
MAT.3.6	 As they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.
MAT.3.7	 But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, “You poisonous snakes! Who showed you how to flee from God’s coming anger? 
MAT.3.8	 Do those things that prove you have turned to God and have changed the way you think and act. 
MAT.3.9	 Don’t think you can say, ‘Abraham is our ancestor.’ I can guarantee that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones. 
MAT.3.10	 The ax is now ready to cut the roots of the trees. Any tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire. 
MAT.3.11	 I baptize you with water so that you will change the way you think and act. But the one who comes after me is more powerful than I. I am not worthy to remove his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 
MAT.3.12	 His winnowing 
MAT.3.13	 Then Jesus appeared. He came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John. 
MAT.3.14	 But John tried to stop him and said, “I need to be baptized by you. Why are you coming to me?”
MAT.3.15	 Jesus answered him, “This is the way it has to be now. This is the proper way to do everything that God requires of us.”
MAT.3.15	Then John gave in to him. 
MAT.3.16	 After Jesus was baptized, he immediately came up from the water. Suddenly, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down as a dove to him. 
MAT.3.17	 Then a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love—my Son with whom I am pleased.”
MAT.4.1	 Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert to be tempted by the devil. 
MAT.4.2	 Jesus did not eat anything for 40 days and 40 nights. At the end of that time, he was hungry.
MAT.4.3	 The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”
MAT.4.4	 Jesus answered, “Scripture says, ‘A person cannot live on bread alone but on every word that God speaks.’ ”
MAT.4.5	 Then the devil took him into the holy city and had him stand on the highest part of the temple. 
MAT.4.6	 He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, jump! Scripture says, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you. They will carry you in their hands so that you never hit your foot against a rock.’ ”
MAT.4.7	 Jesus said to him, “Again, Scripture says, ‘Never tempt the Lord your God.’” 
MAT.4.8	 Once more the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms in the world and their glory. 
MAT.4.9	 The devil said to him, “I will give you all this if you will bow down and worship me.”
MAT.4.10	 Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan! Scripture says, ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’ ”
MAT.4.11	 Then the devil left him, and angels came to take care of him.
MAT.4.12	 When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he went back to Galilee. 
MAT.4.13	 He left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. This was in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. 
MAT.4.14	 So what the prophet Isaiah had said came true:
MAT.4.15	 “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,
MAT.4.15	on the way to the sea,
MAT.4.15	across the Jordan River,
MAT.4.15	Galilee, where foreigners live!
MAT.4.16	 The people who lived in darkness
MAT.4.16	have seen a bright light.
MAT.4.16	A light has risen
MAT.4.16	for those who live in a land overshadowed by death.”
MAT.4.17	 From then on, Jesus began to tell people, “Turn to God and change the way you think and act, because the kingdom of heaven is near!”
MAT.4.18	 As he was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (called Peter) and Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen. 
MAT.4.19	 Jesus said to them, “Come, follow me! I will teach you how to catch people instead of fish.” 
MAT.4.20	 They immediately left their nets and followed him.
MAT.4.21	 As Jesus went on, he saw two other brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee preparing their nets to go fishing. He called them, 
MAT.4.22	 and they immediately left the boat and their father and followed Jesus.
MAT.4.23	 Jesus went all over Galilee. He taught in the synagogues and spread the Good News of the kingdom. He also cured every disease and sickness among the people.
MAT.4.24	 The news about Jesus spread throughout Syria. People brought him everyone who was sick, those who suffered from any kind of disease or pain. They also brought epileptics, those who were paralyzed, and people possessed by demons, and he cured them all. 
MAT.4.25	 Large crowds followed him. They came from Galilee, the Ten Cities,
MAT.5.1	 When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him, 
MAT.5.2	 and he began to teach them:
MAT.5.3	 “Blessed are those who recognize they are spiritually helpless.
MAT.5.3	The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
MAT.5.4	 Blessed are those who mourn.
MAT.5.4	They will be comforted.
MAT.5.5	 Blessed are those who are gentle.
MAT.5.5	They will inherit the earth.
MAT.5.6	 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for God’s approval.
MAT.5.6	They will be satisfied.
MAT.5.7	 Blessed are those who show mercy.
MAT.5.7	They will be treated mercifully.
MAT.5.8	 Blessed are those whose thoughts are pure.
MAT.5.8	They will see God.
MAT.5.9	 Blessed are those who make peace.
MAT.5.9	They will be called God’s children.
MAT.5.10	 Blessed are those who are persecuted for doing what God approves of.
MAT.5.10	The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
MAT.5.11	 “Blessed are you when people insult you,
MAT.5.11	persecute you,
MAT.5.11	lie, and say all kinds of evil things about you because of me.
MAT.5.12	 Rejoice and be glad because you have a great reward in heaven!
MAT.5.12	The prophets who lived before you were persecuted in these ways.
MAT.5.13	 “You are salt for the earth. But if salt loses its taste, how will it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled on by people.
MAT.5.14	 “You are light for the world. A city cannot be hidden when it is located on a hill. 
MAT.5.15	 No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket. Instead, everyone who lights a lamp puts it on a lamp stand. Then its light shines on everyone in the house. 
MAT.5.16	 In the same way let your light shine in front of people. Then they will see the good that you do and praise your Father in heaven.
MAT.5.17	 “Don’t ever think that I came to set aside Moses’ Teachings or the Prophets. I didn’t come to set them aside but to make them come true. 
MAT.5.18	 I can guarantee this truth: Until the earth and the heavens disappear, neither a period nor a comma will disappear from the Scriptures before everything has come true. 
MAT.5.19	 So whoever sets aside any command that seems unimportant and teaches others to do the same will be unimportant in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches what the commands say will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.5.20	 I can guarantee that unless you live a life that has God’s approval and do it more faithfully than the experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
MAT.5.21	 “You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, ‘Never murder. Whoever murders will answer for it in court.’ 
MAT.5.22	 But I can guarantee that whoever is angry with another believer 
MAT.5.23	 “So if you are offering your gift at the altar and remember there that another believer has something against you, 
MAT.5.24	 leave your gift at the altar. First go away and make peace with that person. Then come back and offer your gift.
MAT.5.25	 “Make peace quickly with your opponent while you are on the way to court with him. Otherwise, he will hand you over to the judge. Then the judge will hand you over to an officer, who will throw you into prison. 
MAT.5.26	 I can guarantee this truth: You will never get out until you pay every penny of your fine.
MAT.5.27	 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Never commit adultery.’ 
MAT.5.28	 But I can guarantee that whoever looks with lust at a woman has already committed adultery in his heart.
MAT.5.29	 “So if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose a part of your body than to have all of it thrown into hell. 
MAT.5.30	 And if your right hand leads you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose a part of your body than to have all of it go into hell.
MAT.5.31	 “It has also been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a written notice.’ 
MAT.5.32	 But I can guarantee that any man who divorces his wife for any reason other than unfaithfulness makes her look as though she has committed adultery. Whoever marries a woman divorced in this way makes himself look as though he has committed adultery.
MAT.5.33	 “You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, ‘Never break your oath, but give to the Lord what you swore in an oath to give him.’ 
MAT.5.34	 But I tell you don’t swear an oath at all. Don’t swear an oath by heaven, which is God’s throne, 
MAT.5.35	 or by the earth, which is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, which is the city of the great King. 
MAT.5.36	 And don’t swear an oath by your head. After all, you cannot make one hair black or white. 
MAT.5.37	 Simply say yes or no. Anything more than that comes from the evil one.
MAT.5.38	 “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ 
MAT.5.39	 But I tell you not to oppose an evil person. If someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn your other cheek to him as well. 
MAT.5.40	 If someone wants to sue you in order to take your shirt, let him have your coat too. 
MAT.5.41	 If someone forces you to go one mile, go two miles with him. 
MAT.5.42	 Give to everyone who asks you for something. Don’t turn anyone away who wants to borrow something from you.
MAT.5.43	 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.’ 
MAT.5.44	 But I tell you this: Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you. 
MAT.5.45	 In this way you show that you are children of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun rise on people whether they are good or evil. He lets rain fall on them whether they are just or unjust. 
MAT.5.46	 If you love those who love you, do you deserve a reward? Even the tax collectors do that! 
MAT.5.47	 Are you doing anything remarkable if you welcome only your friends? Everyone does that! 
MAT.5.48	 That is why you must be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect.
MAT.6.1	 “Be careful not to do your good works in public in order to attract attention. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you. 
MAT.6.2	 So when you give to the poor, don’t announce it with trumpet fanfare. This is what hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets in order to be praised by people. I can guarantee this truth: That will be their only reward. 
MAT.6.3	 When you give to the poor, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. 
MAT.6.4	 Give your contributions privately. Your Father sees what you do in private. He will reward you.
MAT.6.5	 “When you pray, don’t be like hypocrites. They like to stand in synagogues and on street corners to pray so that everyone can see them. I can guarantee this truth: That will be their only reward. 
MAT.6.6	 When you pray, go to your room and close the door. Pray privately to your Father who is with you. Your Father sees what you do in private. He will reward you.
MAT.6.7	 “When you pray, don’t ramble like heathens who think they’ll be heard if they talk a lot. 
MAT.6.8	 Don’t be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
MAT.6.9	 “This is how you should pray:
MAT.6.9	Our Father in heaven,
MAT.6.9	let your name be kept holy.
MAT.6.10	 Let your kingdom come.
MAT.6.10	Let your will be done on earth
MAT.6.10	as it is done in heaven.
MAT.6.11	 Give us our daily bread today.
MAT.6.12	 Forgive us as we forgive others.
MAT.6.13	 Don’t allow us to be tempted.
MAT.6.13	Instead, rescue us from the evil one.
MAT.6.14	 “If you forgive the failures of others, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 
MAT.6.15	 But if you don’t forgive others, your Father will not forgive your failures.
MAT.6.16	 “When you fast, stop looking sad like hypocrites. They put on sad faces to make it obvious that they’re fasting. I can guarantee this truth: That will be their only reward. 
MAT.6.17	 When you fast, wash your face and comb your hair. 
MAT.6.18	 Then your fasting won’t be obvious. Instead, it will be obvious to your Father who is with you in private. Your Father sees what you do in private. He will reward you.
MAT.6.19	 “Stop storing up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and rust destroy and thieves break in and steal. 
MAT.6.20	 Instead, store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where moths and rust don’t destroy and thieves don’t break in and steal. 
MAT.6.21	 Your heart will be where your treasure is.
MAT.6.22	 “The eye is the lamp of the body. So if your eye is unclouded, your whole body will be full of light. 
MAT.6.23	 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light in you is darkness, how dark it will be!
MAT.6.24	 “No one can serve two masters. He will hate the first master and love the second, or he will be devoted to the first and despise the second. You cannot serve God and wealth.
MAT.6.25	 “So I tell you to stop worrying about what you will eat, drink, or wear. Isn’t life more than food and the body more than clothes?
MAT.6.26	 “Look at the birds. They don’t plant, harvest, or gather the harvest into barns. Yet, your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth more than they?
MAT.6.27	 “Can any of you add a single hour to your life by worrying?
MAT.6.28	 “And why worry about clothes? Notice how the flowers grow in the field. They never work or spin yarn for clothes. 
MAT.6.29	 But I say that not even Solomon in all his majesty was dressed like one of these flowers. 
MAT.6.30	 That’s the way God clothes the grass in the field. Today it’s alive, and tomorrow it’s thrown into an incinerator. So how much more will he clothe you people who have so little faith?
MAT.6.31	 “Don’t ever worry and say, ‘What are we going to eat?’ or ‘What are we going to drink?’ or ‘What are we going to wear?’ 
MAT.6.32	 Everyone is concerned about these things, and your heavenly Father certainly knows you need all of them. 
MAT.6.33	 But first, be concerned about his kingdom and what has his approval. Then all these things will be provided for you.
MAT.6.34	 “So don’t ever worry about tomorrow. After all, tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
MAT.7.1	 “Stop judging so that you will not be judged. 
MAT.7.2	 Otherwise, you will be judged by the same standard you use to judge others. The standards you use for others will be applied to you. 
MAT.7.3	 So why do you see the piece of sawdust in another believer’s eye and not notice the wooden beam in your own eye? 
MAT.7.4	 How can you say to another believer, ‘Let me take the piece of sawdust out of your eye,’ when you have a beam in your own eye? 
MAT.7.5	 You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the piece of sawdust from another believer’s eye.
MAT.7.6	 “Don’t give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls to pigs. Otherwise, they will trample them and then tear you to pieces.
MAT.7.7	 “Ask, and you will receive. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened for you. 
MAT.7.8	 Everyone who asks will receive. The one who searches will find, and for the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
MAT.7.9	 “If your child asks you for bread, would any of you give him a stone? 
MAT.7.10	 Or if your child asks for a fish, would you give him a snake? 
MAT.7.11	 Even though you’re evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. So how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him?
MAT.7.12	 “Always do for other people everything you want them to do for you. That is ⌊the meaning of⌋ Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets.
MAT.7.13	 “Enter through the narrow gate because the gate and road that lead to destruction are wide. Many enter through the wide gate. 
MAT.7.14	 But the narrow gate and the road that lead to life are full of trouble. Only a few people find the narrow gate.
MAT.7.15	 “Beware of false prophets. They come to you disguised as sheep, but in their hearts they are vicious wolves. 
MAT.7.16	 You will know them by what they produce.
MAT.7.16	“People don’t pick grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles, do they? 
MAT.7.17	 In the same way every good tree produces good fruit, but a rotten tree produces bad fruit. 
MAT.7.18	 A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a rotten tree cannot produce good fruit. 
MAT.7.19	 Any tree that fails to produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire. 
MAT.7.20	 So you will know them by what they produce.
MAT.7.21	 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord!’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the person who does what my Father in heaven wants. 
MAT.7.22	 Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name? Didn’t we force out demons and do many miracles by the power and authority of your name?’ 
MAT.7.23	 Then I will tell them publicly, ‘I’ve never known you. Get away from me, you evil people.’
MAT.7.24	 “Therefore, everyone who hears what I say and obeys it will be like a wise person who built a house on rock. 
MAT.7.25	 Rain poured, and floods came. Winds blew and beat against that house. But it did not collapse, because its foundation was on rock.
MAT.7.26	 “Everyone who hears what I say but doesn’t obey it will be like a foolish person who built a house on sand. 
MAT.7.27	 Rain poured, and floods came. Winds blew and struck that house. It collapsed, and the result was a total disaster.”
MAT.7.28	 When Jesus finished this speech, the crowds were amazed at his teachings. 
MAT.7.29	 Unlike their experts in Moses’ Teachings, he taught them with authority.
MAT.8.1	 When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
MAT.8.2	 A man with a serious skin disease came and bowed down in front of him. The man said to Jesus, “Sir, if you’re willing, you can make me clean.” 
MAT.8.3	 Jesus reached out, touched him, and said, “I’m willing. So be clean!” Immediately, his skin disease went away, and he was clean.
MAT.8.4	 Jesus said to him, “Don’t tell anyone about this! Instead, show yourself to the priest. Then offer the sacrifice Moses commanded as proof to people that you are clean.”
MAT.8.5	 When Jesus went to Capernaum, a Roman army officer came to beg him for help. 
MAT.8.6	 The officer said, “Sir, my servant is lying at home paralyzed and in terrible pain.”
MAT.8.7	 Jesus said to him, “I’ll come to heal him.”
MAT.8.8	 The officer responded, “Sir, I don’t deserve to have you come into my house. But just give a command, and my servant will be healed. 
MAT.8.9	 As you know, I’m in a chain of command and have soldiers at my command. I tell one of them, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and another, ‘Come!’ and he comes. I tell my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
MAT.8.10	 Jesus was amazed when he heard this. He said to those who were following him, “I can guarantee this truth: I haven’t found faith as great as this in anyone in Israel. 
MAT.8.11	 I can guarantee that many will come from all over the world. They will eat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.8.12	 The citizens of that kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness. People will cry and be in extreme pain there.
MAT.8.13	 Jesus told the officer, “Go! What you believed will be done for you.” And at that moment the servant was healed.
MAT.8.14	 When Jesus went to Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law in bed with a fever. 
MAT.8.15	 Jesus touched her hand, and the fever went away. So she got up and prepared a meal for him.
MAT.8.16	 In the evening the people brought him many who were possessed by demons. He forced the ⌊evil⌋ spirits out of people with a command and cured everyone who was sick. 
MAT.8.17	 So what the prophet Isaiah had said came true: “He took away our weaknesses and removed our diseases.”
MAT.8.18	 Now, when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he ordered ⌊his disciples⌋ to cross to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
MAT.8.19	 An expert in Moses’ Teachings came to him and said, “Teacher, I’ll follow you wherever you go.”
MAT.8.20	 Jesus told him, “Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to sleep.”
MAT.8.21	 Another disciple said to him, “Sir, first let me go to bury my father.”
MAT.8.22	 But Jesus told him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”
MAT.8.23	 Jesus’ disciples went with him as he left in a boat. 
MAT.8.24	 Suddenly, a severe storm came across the sea. The waves were covering the boat. Yet, Jesus was sleeping.
MAT.8.25	 So they woke him up, saying, “Lord! Save us! We’re going to die!”
MAT.8.26	 Jesus said to them, “Why do you cowards have so little faith?” Then he got up, gave an order to the wind and the sea, and the sea became very calm.
MAT.8.27	 The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!”
MAT.8.28	 When he arrived in the territory of the Gadarenes on the other side ⌊of the Sea of Galilee⌋, two men met him. They were possessed by demons and had come out of the tombs. No one could travel along that road because the men were so dangerous.
MAT.8.29	 They shouted, “Why are you bothering us now, Son of God? Did you come here to torture us before it is time?”
MAT.8.30	 A large herd of pigs was feeding in the distance. 
MAT.8.31	 The demons begged Jesus, “If you’re going to force us out, send us into that herd of pigs.”
MAT.8.32	 Jesus said to them, “Go!” The demons came out and went into the pigs. Suddenly, the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water. 
MAT.8.33	 Those who took care of the pigs ran into the city. There they reported everything, especially about the men possessed by demons.
MAT.8.34	 Everyone from the city went to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their territory.
MAT.9.1	 Jesus got into a boat, crossed the sea, and came to his own city. 
MAT.9.2	 Some people brought him a paralyzed man on a stretcher.
MAT.9.2	When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, “Cheer up, friend! Your sins are forgiven.”
MAT.9.3	 Then some of the experts in Moses’ Teachings thought, “He’s dishonoring God.”
MAT.9.4	 Jesus knew what they were thinking. He asked them, “Why are you thinking evil things? 
MAT.9.5	 Is it easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? 
MAT.9.6	 I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” Then he said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home.”
MAT.9.7	 So the man got up and went home. 
MAT.9.8	 When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe and praised God for giving such authority to humans.
MAT.9.9	 When Jesus was leaving that place, he saw a man sitting in a tax office. The man’s name was Matthew. Jesus said to him, “Follow me!” So Matthew got up and followed him.
MAT.9.10	 Later Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house. Many tax collectors and sinners came to eat with Jesus and his disciples. 
MAT.9.11	 The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
MAT.9.12	 When Jesus heard that, he said, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor; those who are sick do. 
MAT.9.13	 Learn what this means: ‘I want mercy, not sacrifices.’ I’ve come to call sinners, not people who think they have God’s approval.”
MAT.9.14	 Then John’s disciples came to Jesus. They said, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often but your disciples never do?”
MAT.9.15	 Jesus replied, “Can wedding guests be sad while the groom is still with them? The time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.
MAT.9.16	 “No one patches an old coat with a new piece of cloth that will shrink. When the patch shrinks, it will rip away from the coat, and the tear will become worse. 
MAT.9.17	 Nor do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins burst, the wine runs out, and the skins are ruined. Rather, people pour new wine into fresh skins, and both are saved.”
MAT.9.18	 A ⌊synagogue⌋ leader came to Jesus while he was talking to John’s disciples. He bowed down in front of Jesus and said, “My daughter just died. Come, lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
MAT.9.19	 Jesus and his disciples got up and followed the man.
MAT.9.20	 Then a woman came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his clothes. She had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years. 
MAT.9.21	 She thought, “If I only touch his clothes, I’ll get well.”
MAT.9.22	 When Jesus turned and saw her he said, “Cheer up, daughter! Your faith has made you well.” At that very moment the woman became well.
MAT.9.23	 Jesus came to the ⌊synagogue⌋ leader’s house. He saw flute players and a noisy crowd. 
MAT.9.24	 He said to them, “Leave! The girl is not dead. She’s sleeping.” But they laughed at him.
MAT.9.25	 When the crowd had been put outside, Jesus went in, took her hand, and the girl came back to life.
MAT.9.26	 The news about this spread throughout that region.
MAT.9.27	 When Jesus left that place, two blind men followed him. They shouted, “Have mercy on us, Son of David.”
MAT.9.28	 Jesus went into a house, and the blind men followed him. He said to them, “Do you believe that I can do this?”
MAT.9.28	“Yes, Lord,” they answered.
MAT.9.29	 He touched their eyes and said, “What you have believed will be done for you!” 
MAT.9.30	 Then they could see.
MAT.9.30	He warned them, “Don’t let anyone know about this!” 
MAT.9.31	 But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that region.
MAT.9.32	 As they were leaving, some people brought a man to Jesus. The man was unable to talk because he was possessed by a demon. 
MAT.9.33	 But as soon as the demon was forced out, the man began to speak.
MAT.9.33	The crowds were amazed and said, “We have never seen anything like this in Israel!”
MAT.9.34	 But the Pharisees said, “He forces demons out of people with the help of the ruler of demons.”
MAT.9.35	 Jesus went to all the towns and villages. He taught in the synagogues and spread the Good News of the kingdom. He also cured every disease and sickness.
MAT.9.36	 When he saw the crowds, he felt sorry for them. They were troubled and helpless like sheep without a shepherd. 
MAT.9.37	 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is large, but the workers are few. 
MAT.9.38	 So ask the Lord who gives this harvest to send workers to harvest his crops.”
MAT.10.1	 Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority to force evil spirits out of people and to cure every disease and sickness.
MAT.10.2	 These are the names of the twelve apostles: first and foremost, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee; 
MAT.10.3	 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James (son of Alphaeus), and Thaddaeus; 
MAT.10.4	 Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus.
MAT.10.5	 Jesus sent these twelve out with the following instructions: “Don’t go among people who are not Jewish or into any Samaritan city. 
MAT.10.6	 Instead, go to the lost sheep of the nation of Israel. 
MAT.10.7	 As you go, spread this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’ 
MAT.10.8	 Cure the sick, bring the dead back to life, cleanse those with skin diseases, and force demons out of people. Give these things without charging, since you received them without paying.
MAT.10.9	 “Don’t take any gold, silver, or even copper coins in your pockets. 
MAT.10.10	 Don’t take a traveling bag for the trip, a change of clothes, sandals, or a walking stick. After all, the worker deserves to have his needs met.
MAT.10.11	 “When you go into a city or village, look for people who will listen to you there. Stay with them until you leave ⌊that place⌋. 
MAT.10.12	 When you go into a house, greet the family. 
MAT.10.13	 If it is a family that listens to you, allow your greeting to stand. But if it is not receptive, take back your greeting. 
MAT.10.14	 If anyone doesn’t welcome you or listen to what you say, leave that house or city, and shake its dust off your feet. 
MAT.10.15	 I can guarantee this truth: Judgment day will be better for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
MAT.10.16	 “I’m sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as cunning as snakes but as innocent as doves. 
MAT.10.17	 Watch out for people who will hand you over to the Jewish courts and whip you in their synagogues. 
MAT.10.18	 Because of me you will even be brought in front of governors and kings to testify to them and to everyone in the world. 
MAT.10.19	 When they hand you over ⌊to the authorities⌋, don’t worry about what to say or how to say it. When the time comes, you will be given what to say. 
MAT.10.20	 Indeed, you’re not the ones who will be speaking. The Spirit of your Father will be speaking through you.
MAT.10.21	 “Brother will hand over brother to death; a father will hand over his child. Children will rebel against their parents and kill them. 
MAT.10.22	 Everyone will hate you because you are committed to me. But the person who patiently endures to the end will be saved. 
MAT.10.23	 So when they persecute you in one city, flee to another. I can guarantee this truth: Before you have gone through every city in Israel, the Son of Man will come.
MAT.10.24	 “A student is not better than his teacher. Nor is a slave better than his owner. 
MAT.10.25	 It is enough for a student to become like his teacher and a slave like his owner. If they have called the owner of the house Beelzebul,
MAT.10.26	 So don’t be afraid of them. Nothing has been covered that will not be exposed. Whatever is secret will be made known. 
MAT.10.27	 Tell in the daylight what I say to you in the dark. Shout from the housetops what you hear whispered. 
MAT.10.28	 Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the one who can destroy both body and soul in hell.
MAT.10.29	 “Aren’t two sparrows sold for a penny? Not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father’s permission. 
MAT.10.30	 Every hair on your head has been counted. 
MAT.10.31	 Don’t be afraid! You are worth more than many sparrows.
MAT.10.32	 “So I will acknowledge in front of my Father in heaven that person who acknowledges me in front of others. 
MAT.10.33	 But I will tell my Father in heaven that I don’t know the person who tells others that he doesn’t know me.
MAT.10.34	 “Don’t think that I came to bring peace to earth. I didn’t come to bring peace but conflict. 
MAT.10.35	 I came to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 
MAT.10.36	 A person’s enemies will be the members of his own family.
MAT.10.37	 “The person who loves his father or mother more than me does not deserve to be my disciple. The person who loves a son or daughter more than me does not deserve to be my disciple. 
MAT.10.38	 Whoever doesn’t take up his cross and follow me doesn’t deserve to be my disciple. 
MAT.10.39	 The person who tries to preserve his life will lose it, but the person who loses his life for me will preserve it.
MAT.10.40	 “The person who welcomes you welcomes me, and the person who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. 
MAT.10.41	 The person who welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. The person who welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward. 
MAT.10.42	 I can guarantee this truth: Whoever gives any of my humble followers a cup of cold water because that person is my disciple will certainly never lose his reward.”
MAT.11.1	 After Jesus finished giving his twelve disciples these instructions, he moved on from there to teach his message in their cities.
MAT.11.2	 When John was in prison, he heard about the things Christ had done. So he sent his disciples 
MAT.11.3	 to ask Jesus, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for someone else?”
MAT.11.4	 Jesus answered John’s disciples, “Go back, and tell John what you hear and see: 
MAT.11.5	 Blind people see again, lame people are walking, those with skin diseases are made clean, deaf people hear again, dead people are brought back to life, and poor people hear the Good News. 
MAT.11.6	 Whoever doesn’t lose his faith in me is indeed blessed.”
MAT.11.7	 As they were leaving, Jesus spoke to the crowds about John. “What did you go into the desert to see? Tall grass swaying in the wind? 
MAT.11.8	 Really, what did you go to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear fine clothes are in royal palaces.
MAT.11.9	 “Really, what did you go to see? A prophet? Let me tell you that he is far more than a prophet. 
MAT.11.10	 John is the one about whom Scripture says,
MAT.11.10	‘I’m sending my messenger ahead of you
MAT.11.10	to prepare the way in front of you.’
MAT.11.11	 “I can guarantee this truth: Of all the people ever born, no one is greater than John the Baptizer. Yet, the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John. 
MAT.11.12	 From the time of John the Baptizer until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful people have been seizing it. 
MAT.11.13	 All the Prophets and Moses’ Teachings prophesied up to the time of John. 
MAT.11.14	 If you are willing to accept their message, John is the Elijah who was to come. 
MAT.11.15	 Let the person who has ears listen!
MAT.11.16	 “How can I describe the people who are living now? They are like children who sit in the marketplaces and shout to other children,
MAT.11.17	 ‘We played music for you,
MAT.11.17	but you didn’t dance.
MAT.11.17	We sang a funeral song,
MAT.11.17	but you didn’t show any sadness.’
MAT.11.18	 “John came neither eating nor drinking, and people say, ‘There’s a demon in him!’ 
MAT.11.19	 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and people say, ‘Look at him! He’s a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’
MAT.11.19	“Yet, wisdom is proved right by its actions.”
MAT.11.20	 Then Jesus denounced the cities where he had worked most of his miracles because they had not changed the way they thought and acted. 
MAT.11.21	 “How horrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How horrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles worked in you had been worked in Tyre and Sidon, they would have changed the way they thought and acted long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
MAT.11.22	 I can guarantee that judgment day will be better for Tyre and Sidon than for you. 
MAT.11.23	 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to heaven? No, you will go down to hell! If the miracles that had been worked in you had been worked in Sodom, it would still be there today. 
MAT.11.24	 I can guarantee that judgment day will be better for Sodom than for you.”
MAT.11.25	 At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from wise and intelligent people and revealing them to little children. 
MAT.11.26	 Yes, Father, this is what pleased you.
MAT.11.27	 “My Father has turned everything over to me. Only the Father knows the Son. And no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.
MAT.11.28	 “Come to me, all who are tired from carrying heavy loads, and I will give you rest. 
MAT.11.29	 Place my yoke 
MAT.11.30	 because my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
MAT.12.1	 Then on a day of worship Jesus walked through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry and began to pick the heads of grain to eat.
MAT.12.2	 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing something that is not right to do on the day of worship.”
MAT.12.3	 Jesus asked them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his men were hungry? 
MAT.12.4	 Haven’t you read how he went into the house of God and ate 
MAT.12.5	 Or haven’t you read in Moses’ Teachings that on the day of worship the priests in the temple do things they shouldn’t on the day of worship yet remain innocent? 
MAT.12.6	 I can guarantee that something 
MAT.12.7	 If you had known what ‘I want mercy, not sacrifices’ means, you would not have condemned innocent people.
MAT.12.8	 “The Son of Man has authority over the day of worship.”
MAT.12.9	 Jesus moved on from there and went into a synagogue. 
MAT.12.10	 A man with a paralyzed hand was there. The people asked Jesus whether it was right to heal on a day of worship so that they could accuse him of doing something wrong.
MAT.12.11	 Jesus said to them, “Suppose one of you has a sheep. If it falls into a pit on a day of worship, wouldn’t you take hold of it and lift it out? 
MAT.12.12	 Certainly, a human is more valuable than a sheep! So it is right to do good on the day of worship.”
MAT.12.13	 Then he said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man held it out, and it became normal again, as healthy as the other.
MAT.12.14	 The Pharisees left and plotted to kill Jesus. 
MAT.12.15	 He knew about this, so he left that place.
MAT.12.15	Many people followed him, and he cured all of them. 
MAT.12.16	 He also ordered them not to tell people who he was. 
MAT.12.17	 So what the prophet Isaiah had said came true:
MAT.12.18	 “Here is my servant
MAT.12.18	whom I have chosen,
MAT.12.18	whom I love,
MAT.12.18	and in whom I delight.
MAT.12.18	I will put my Spirit on him,
MAT.12.18	and he will announce justice to the nations.
MAT.12.19	 He will not quarrel or shout,
MAT.12.19	and no one will hear his voice in the streets.
MAT.12.20	 He will not break off a damaged cattail.
MAT.12.20	He will not even put out a smoking wick
MAT.12.20	until he has made justice victorious.
MAT.12.21	 The nations will have hope because of him.”
MAT.12.22	 Then some people brought Jesus a man possessed by a demon. The demon made the man blind and unable to talk. Jesus cured him so that he could talk and see.
MAT.12.23	 The crowds were all amazed and said, “Can this man be the Son of David?” 
MAT.12.24	 When the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man can force demons out of people only with the help of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons.”
MAT.12.25	 Since Jesus knew what they were thinking, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is ruined. And every city or household divided against itself will not last. 
MAT.12.26	 If Satan forces Satan out, he is divided against himself. How, then, can his kingdom last? 
MAT.12.27	 If I force demons out of people with the help of Beelzebul, who helps your followers force them out? That’s why they will be your judges. 
MAT.12.28	 But if I force demons out with the help of God’s Spirit, then the kingdom of God has come to you. 
MAT.12.29	 How can anyone go into a strong man’s house and steal his property? First he must tie up the strong man. Then he can go through his house and steal his property.
MAT.12.30	 “Whoever isn’t with me is against me. Whoever doesn’t gather with me scatters. 
MAT.12.31	 So I can guarantee that people will be forgiven for any sin or cursing. However, cursing the Spirit will not be forgiven. 
MAT.12.32	 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven in this world or the next.
MAT.12.33	 “Make a tree good, and then its fruit will be good. Or make a tree rotten, and then its fruit will be rotten. A person can recognize a tree by its fruit. 
MAT.12.34	 You poisonous snakes! How can you evil people say anything good? Your mouth says what comes from inside you. 
MAT.12.35	 Good people do the good things that are in them. But evil people do the evil things that are in them.
MAT.12.36	 “I can guarantee that on judgment day people will have to give an account of every careless word they say. 
MAT.12.37	 By your words you will be declared innocent, or by your words you will be declared guilty.”
MAT.12.38	 Then some experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees said, “Teacher, we want you to show us a miraculous sign.”
MAT.12.39	 He responded, “The people of an evil and unfaithful era look for a miraculous sign. But the only sign they will get is the sign of the prophet Jonah. 
MAT.12.40	 Just as Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. 
MAT.12.41	 The men of Nineveh will stand up with you at the time of judgment and will condemn you, because they turned to God and changed the way they thought and acted when Jonah spoke his message. But look, someone greater than Jonah is here! 
MAT.12.42	 The queen from the south will stand up at the time of judgment with you. She will condemn you, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon’s wisdom. But look, someone greater than Solomon is here!
MAT.12.43	 “When an evil spirit comes out of a person, it goes through dry places looking for a place to rest. But it doesn’t find any. 
MAT.12.44	 Then it says, ‘I’ll go back to the home I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean, and in order. 
MAT.12.45	 Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and take up permanent residence there. In the end the condition of that person is worse than it was before. That is what will happen to the evil people of this day.”
MAT.12.46	 While Jesus was still talking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside. They wanted to talk to him. 
MAT.12.47	 Someone told him, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside. They want to talk to you.”
MAT.12.48	 He replied to the man speaking to him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?” 
MAT.12.49	 Pointing with his hand at his disciples, he said, “Look, here are my mother and my brothers. 
MAT.12.50	 Whoever does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother and sister and mother.”
MAT.13.1	 That same day Jesus left the house and sat down by the Sea of Galilee. 
MAT.13.2	 The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat. He sat in the boat while the entire crowd stood on the shore. 
MAT.13.3	 Then he used stories as illustrations to tell them many things.
MAT.13.3	He said, “Listen! A farmer went to plant seed. 
MAT.13.4	 Some seeds were planted along the road, and birds came and devoured them. 
MAT.13.5	 Other seeds were planted on rocky ground, where there was little soil. The plants sprouted quickly because the soil wasn’t deep. 
MAT.13.6	 But when the sun came up, they were scorched. They withered because their roots weren’t deep enough. 
MAT.13.7	 Other seeds were planted among thornbushes, and the thornbushes grew up and choked them. 
MAT.13.8	 But other seeds were planted on good ground and produced grain. They produced one hundred, sixty, or thirty times as much as was planted. 
MAT.13.9	 Let the person who has ears listen!”
MAT.13.10	 The disciples asked him, “Why do you use stories as illustrations when you speak to people?”
MAT.13.11	 Jesus answered, “Knowledge about the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you. But it has not been given to the crowd. 
MAT.13.12	 Those who understand ⌊these mysteries⌋ will be given ⌊more knowledge⌋, and they will excel ⌊in understanding them⌋. However, some people don’t understand ⌊these mysteries⌋. Even what they understand will be taken away from them. 
MAT.13.13	 This is why I speak to them this way. They see, but they’re blind. They hear, but they don’t listen. They don’t even try to understand. 
MAT.13.14	 So they make Isaiah’s prophecy come true:
MAT.13.14	‘You will hear clearly but never understand.
MAT.13.14	You will see clearly but never comprehend.
MAT.13.15	 These people have become close-minded
MAT.13.15	and hard of hearing.
MAT.13.15	They have shut their eyes
MAT.13.15	so that their eyes never see.
MAT.13.15	Their ears never hear.
MAT.13.15	Their minds never understand.
MAT.13.15	And they never return to me for healing!’
MAT.13.16	 “Blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear. 
MAT.13.17	 I can guarantee this truth: Many prophets and many of God’s people longed to see what you see but didn’t see it, to hear what you hear but didn’t hear it.
MAT.13.18	 “Listen to what the story about the farmer means. 
MAT.13.19	 Someone hears the word about the kingdom but doesn’t understand it. The evil one comes at once and snatches away what was planted in him. This is what the seed planted along the road illustrates. 
MAT.13.20	 The seed planted on rocky ground ⌊is the person who⌋ hears the word and accepts it at once with joy. 
MAT.13.21	 Since he doesn’t have any root, he lasts only a little while. When suffering or persecution comes along because of the word, he immediately falls ⌊from faith⌋. 
MAT.13.22	 The seed planted among thornbushes ⌊is another person who⌋ hears the word. But the worries of life and the deceitful pleasures of riches choke the word so that it can’t produce anything. 
MAT.13.23	 But the seed planted on good ground ⌊is the person who⌋ hears and understands the word. This type produces crops. They produce one hundred, sixty, or thirty times as much as was planted.”
MAT.13.24	 Jesus used another illustration. He said, “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who planted good seed in his field. 
MAT.13.25	 But while people were asleep, his enemy planted weeds in the wheat field and went away. 
MAT.13.26	 When the wheat came up and formed kernels, weeds appeared.
MAT.13.27	 “The owner’s workers came to him and asked, ‘Sir, didn’t you plant good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?’
MAT.13.28	 “He told them, ‘An enemy did this.’
MAT.13.28	“His workers asked him, ‘Do you want us to pull out the weeds?’
MAT.13.29	 “He replied, ‘No. If you pull out the weeds, you may pull out the wheat with them. 
MAT.13.30	 Let both grow together until the harvest. When the grain is cut, I will tell the workers to gather the weeds first and tie them in bundles to be burned. But I’ll have them bring the wheat into my barn.’ ”
MAT.13.31	 Jesus used another illustration. He said, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone planted in a field. 
MAT.13.32	 It’s one of the smallest seeds. However, when it has grown, it is taller than the garden plants. It becomes a tree that is large enough for birds to nest in its branches.”
MAT.13.33	 He used another illustration. “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman mixed into a large amount of flour until the yeast worked its way through all the dough.”
MAT.13.34	 Jesus used illustrations to tell the crowds all these things. He did not tell them anything without illustrating it with a story. 
MAT.13.35	 So what the prophet had said came true:
MAT.13.35	“I will open my mouth to illustrate points.
MAT.13.35	I will tell what has been hidden since the world was made.”
MAT.13.36	 When Jesus had sent the people away, he went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain what the illustration of the weeds in the field means.”
MAT.13.37	 He answered, “The one who plants the good seeds is the Son of Man. 
MAT.13.38	 The field is the world. The good seeds are those who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are those who belong to the evil one. 
MAT.13.39	 The enemy who planted them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. The workers are angels. 
MAT.13.40	 Just as weeds are gathered and burned, so it will be at the end of time. 
MAT.13.41	 The Son of Man will send his angels. They will gather everything in his kingdom that causes people to sin and everyone who does evil. 
MAT.13.42	 The angels will throw them into a blazing furnace. People will cry and be in extreme pain there. 
MAT.13.43	 Then the people who have God’s approval will shine like the sun in their Father’s kingdom. Let the person who has ears listen!
MAT.13.44	 “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field. When a man discovered it, he buried it again. He was so delighted with it that he went away, sold everything he had, and bought that field.
MAT.13.45	 “Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant who was searching for fine pearls. 
MAT.13.46	 When he found a valuable pearl, he went away, sold everything he had, and bought it.
MAT.13.47	 “Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea. It gathered all kinds of fish. 
MAT.13.48	 When it was full, they pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down, gathered the good fish into containers, and threw the bad ones away. 
MAT.13.49	 The same thing will happen at the end of time. The angels will go out and separate the evil people from people who have God’s approval. 
MAT.13.50	 Then the angels will throw the evil people into a blazing furnace. They will cry and be in extreme pain there.
MAT.13.51	 “Have you understood all of this?”
MAT.13.51	“Yes,” they answered.
MAT.13.52	 So Jesus said to them, “That is why every student of the Scriptures who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a home owner. He brings new and old things out of his treasure chest.”
MAT.13.53	 When Jesus had finished these illustrations, he left that place.
MAT.13.54	 Jesus went to his hometown and taught the people in the synagogue in a way that amazed them. People were asking, “Where did this man get this wisdom and the power to do these miracles? 
MAT.13.55	 Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary? Aren’t his brothers’ names James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? 
MAT.13.56	 And aren’t all his sisters here with us? Where, then, did this man get all this?” 
MAT.13.57	 So they took offense at him.
MAT.13.57	But Jesus said to them, “The only place a prophet isn’t honored is in his hometown and in his own house.”
MAT.13.58	 He didn’t work many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
MAT.14.1	 At that time Herod, ruler of Galilee, heard the news about Jesus. 
MAT.14.2	 He said to his officials, “This is John the Baptizer! He has come back to life. That’s why he has the power to perform these miracles.”
MAT.14.3	 Herod had arrested John, tied him up, and put him in prison. Herod did this for Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. 
MAT.14.4	 John had been telling Herod, “It’s not right for you to be married to her.” 
MAT.14.5	 So Herod wanted to kill John. However, he was afraid of the people because they thought John was a prophet.
MAT.14.6	 When Herod celebrated his birthday, Herodias’ daughter danced for his guests. Herod was so delighted with her that 
MAT.14.7	 he swore he would give her anything she wanted.
MAT.14.8	 Urged by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.”
MAT.14.9	 The king regretted his promise. But because of his oath and his guests, he ordered that her wish be granted. 
MAT.14.10	 He had John’s head cut off in prison. 
MAT.14.11	 So the head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who took it to her mother.
MAT.14.12	 John’s disciples came for the body and buried it. Then they went to tell Jesus.
MAT.14.13	 When Jesus heard about John, he left in a boat and went to a place where he could be alone. The crowds heard about this and followed him on foot from the cities. 
MAT.14.14	 When Jesus got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd. He felt sorry for them and cured their sick people.
MAT.14.15	 In the evening the disciples came to him. They said, “No one lives around here, and it’s already late. Send the crowds to the villages to buy food for themselves.”
MAT.14.16	 Jesus said to them, “They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”
MAT.14.17	 They told him, “All we have here are five loaves of bread and two fish.”
MAT.14.18	 Jesus said, “Bring them to me.”
MAT.14.19	 Then he ordered the people to sit down on the grass. After he took the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed the food. He broke the loaves apart, gave them to the disciples, and they gave them to the people. 
MAT.14.20	 All of them ate as much as they wanted. When they picked up the leftover pieces, they filled twelve baskets.
MAT.14.21	 About five thousand men had eaten. (This number does not include the women and children who had eaten.)
MAT.14.22	 Jesus quickly made his disciples get into a boat and cross to the other side ahead of him while he sent the people away. 
MAT.14.23	 After sending the people away, he went up a mountain to pray by himself. When evening came, he was there alone.
MAT.14.24	 The boat, now hundreds of yards from shore, was being thrown around by the waves because it was going against the wind.
MAT.14.25	 Between three and six o’clock in the morning, he came to them. He was walking on the sea. 
MAT.14.26	 When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified. They said, “It’s a ghost!” and began to scream because they were afraid.
MAT.14.27	 Immediately, Jesus said, “Calm down! It’s me. Don’t be afraid!”
MAT.14.28	 Peter answered, “Lord, if it is you, order me to come to you on the water.”
MAT.14.29	 Jesus said, “Come!” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	 But when he noticed how strong the wind was, he became afraid and started to sink. He shouted, “Lord, save me!”
MAT.14.31	 Immediately, Jesus reached out, caught hold of him, and said, “You have so little faith! Why did you doubt?”
MAT.14.32	 When they got into the boat, the wind stopped blowing. 
MAT.14.33	 The men in the boat bowed down in front of Jesus and said, “You are truly the Son of God.”
MAT.14.34	 They crossed the sea and landed at Gennesaret. 
MAT.14.35	 The men there recognized Jesus and sent messengers all around the countryside. The people brought him everyone who was sick. 
MAT.14.36	 They begged him to let them touch just the edge of his clothes. Everyone who touched his clothes was made well.
MAT.15.1	 Then some Pharisees and experts in Moses’ Teachings came from Jerusalem to Jesus. They asked, 
MAT.15.2	 “Why do your disciples break the traditions of our ancestors? They do not wash their hands before they eat.”
MAT.15.3	 He answered them, “Why do you break the commandment of God because of your traditions? 
MAT.15.4	 For example, God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’ and ‘Whoever curses father or mother must be put to death.’ 
MAT.15.5	 But you say that whoever tells his father or mother, ‘I have given to God whatever support you might have received from me,’ 
MAT.15.6	 does not have to honor his father. Because of your traditions you have destroyed the authority of God’s word. 
MAT.15.7	 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:
MAT.15.8	 ‘These people honor me with their lips,
MAT.15.8	but their hearts are far from me.
MAT.15.9	 Their worship of me is pointless,
MAT.15.9	because their teachings are rules made by humans.’ ”
MAT.15.10	 Then he called the crowd and said to them, “Listen and try to understand! 
MAT.15.11	 What goes into a person’s mouth doesn’t make him unclean.
MAT.15.12	 Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you realize that when the Pharisees heard your statement they were offended?”
MAT.15.13	 He answered, “Any plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted. 
MAT.15.14	 Leave them alone! They are blind leaders. When one blind person leads another, both will fall into the same pit.”
MAT.15.15	 Peter said to him, “Explain this illustration to us.”
MAT.15.16	 Jesus said, “Don’t you understand yet? 
MAT.15.17	 Don’t you know that whatever goes into the mouth goes into the stomach and then into a toilet? 
MAT.15.18	 But whatever goes out of the mouth comes from within, and that’s what makes a person unclean. 
MAT.15.19	 Evil thoughts, murder, adultery, ⌊other⌋ sexual sins, stealing, lying, and cursing come from within. 
MAT.15.20	 These are the things that make a person unclean. But eating without washing one’s hands doesn’t make a person unclean.”
MAT.15.21	 Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
MAT.15.22	 A Canaanite woman from that territory came ⌊to him⌋ and began to shout, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is tormented by a demon.”
MAT.15.23	 But he did not answer her at all. Then his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away. She keeps shouting behind us.”
MAT.15.24	 Jesus responded, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the nation of Israel.”
MAT.15.25	 She came to him, bowed down, and said, “Lord, help me!”
MAT.15.26	 Jesus replied, “It’s not right to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.”
MAT.15.27	 She said, “You’re right, Lord. But even the dogs eat scraps that fall from their masters’ tables.”
MAT.15.28	 Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, you have strong faith! What you wanted will be done for you.” At that moment her daughter was cured.
MAT.15.29	 Jesus moved on from there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat there.
MAT.15.30	 A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the lame, blind, disabled, those unable to talk, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he cured them. 
MAT.15.31	 The crowd was amazed to see mute people talking, the disabled cured, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. So they praised the God of Israel.
MAT.15.32	 Jesus called his disciples and said, “I feel sorry for the people. They have been with me three days now and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry, or they may become exhausted on their way home.”
MAT.15.33	 His disciples asked him, “Where could we get enough bread to feed such a crowd in this place where no one lives?”
MAT.15.34	 Jesus asked them, “How many loaves of bread do you have?”
MAT.15.34	They answered, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
MAT.15.35	 He ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground. 
MAT.15.36	 He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks to God. Then he broke the bread and gave it to the disciples, and they gave the bread and fish to the people.
MAT.15.37	 All of them ate as much as they wanted. The disciples picked up the leftover pieces and filled seven large baskets. 
MAT.15.38	 Four thousand men had eaten. (This number does not include the women and children who had eaten.)
MAT.15.39	 After he sent the people on their way, Jesus stepped into the boat and came to the territory of Magadan.
MAT.16.1	 The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. So they asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
MAT.16.2	 He responded to them, “In the evening you say that the weather will be fine because the sky is red. 
MAT.16.3	 And in the morning you say that there will be a storm today because the sky is red and overcast. You can forecast the weather by judging the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.
MAT.16.4	 “Evil and unfaithful people look for a miraculous sign. But the only sign they will be given is that of Jonah.”
MAT.16.4	Then he left them standing there and went away.
MAT.16.5	 The disciples had forgotten to take any bread along when they went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
MAT.16.6	 Jesus said to them, “Be careful! Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”
MAT.16.7	 The disciples had been discussing among themselves that they had not taken any bread along.
MAT.16.8	 Jesus knew about their conversation and asked, “Why are you discussing among yourselves that you don’t have any bread? You have so little faith! 
MAT.16.9	 Don’t you understand yet? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you filled? 
MAT.16.10	 Don’t you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many large baskets you filled? 
MAT.16.11	 Why don’t you understand that I wasn’t talking to you about bread? Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”
MAT.16.12	 Then they understood that he didn’t say to watch out for the yeast in bread, but to watch out for the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”
MAT.16.14	 They answered, “Some say you are John the Baptizer, others Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
MAT.16.15	 He asked them, “But who do you say I am?”
MAT.16.16	 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God!”
MAT.16.17	 Jesus replied, “Simon, son of Jonah, you are blessed! No human revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven revealed it to you. 
MAT.16.18	 You are Peter, and I can guarantee that on this rock 
MAT.16.19	 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you imprison, God will imprison. And whatever you set free, God will set free.”
MAT.16.20	 Then he strictly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
MAT.16.21	 From that time on Jesus began to inform his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem. There he would have to suffer a lot because of the leaders, the chief priests, and the experts in Moses’ Teachings. He would be killed, but on the third day he would be brought back to life.
MAT.16.22	 Peter took him aside and objected to this. He said, “Heaven forbid, Lord! This must never happen to you!”
MAT.16.23	 But Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get out of my way, Satan! You are tempting me to sin. You aren’t thinking the way God thinks but the way humans think.”
MAT.16.24	 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Those who want to come with me must say no to the things they want, pick up their crosses, and follow me. 
MAT.16.25	 Those who want to save their lives will lose them. But those who lose their lives for me will find them. 
MAT.16.26	 What good will it do for people to win the whole world and lose their lives? Or what will a person give in exchange for life? 
MAT.16.27	 The Son of Man will come with his angels in his Father’s glory. Then he will pay back each person based on what that person has done. 
MAT.16.28	 I can guarantee this truth: Some people who are standing here will not die until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”
MAT.17.1	 After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John (the brother of James) and led them up a high mountain where they could be alone.
MAT.17.2	 Jesus’ appearance changed in front of them. His face became as bright as the sun and his clothes as white as light. 
MAT.17.3	 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them and were talking with Jesus.
MAT.17.4	 Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it’s good that we’re here. If you want, I’ll put up three tents here—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
MAT.17.5	 He was still speaking when a bright cloud overshadowed them. Then a voice came out of the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I love and with whom I am pleased. Listen to him!”
MAT.17.6	 The disciples were terrified when they heard this and fell facedown on the ground. 
MAT.17.7	 But Jesus touched them and said, “Get up, and don’t be afraid!” 
MAT.17.8	 As they raised their heads, they saw no one but Jesus.
MAT.17.9	 On their way down the mountain, Jesus ordered them, “Don’t tell anyone what you have seen. Wait until the Son of Man has been brought back to life.”
MAT.17.10	 So the disciples asked him, “Why do the experts in Moses’ Teachings say that Elijah must come first?”
MAT.17.11	 Jesus answered, “Elijah is coming and will put everything in order again. 
MAT.17.12	 Actually, I can guarantee that Elijah has already come. Yet, people treated him as they pleased because they didn’t recognize him. In the same way they’re going to make the Son of Man suffer.”
MAT.17.13	 Then the disciples understood that he was talking about John the Baptizer.
MAT.17.14	 When they came to a crowd, a man came up to Jesus, knelt in front of him, 
MAT.17.15	 and said, “Sir, have mercy on my son. He suffers from seizures. Often he falls into fire or water. 
MAT.17.16	 I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn’t cure him.”
MAT.17.17	 Jesus replied, “You unbelieving and corrupt generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!”
MAT.17.18	 Jesus ordered the demon to come out of the boy. At that moment the boy was cured.
MAT.17.19	 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, “Why couldn’t we force the demon out of the boy?”
MAT.17.20	 He told them, “Because you have so little faith. I can guarantee this truth: If your faith is the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.” 
MAT.17.22	 While they were traveling together in Galilee, Jesus told them, “The Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to people. 
MAT.17.23	 They will kill him, but on the third day he will be brought back to life.” Then the disciples became very sad.
MAT.17.24	 When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter. They asked him, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the temple tax?”
MAT.17.25	 “Certainly,” he answered.
MAT.17.25	Peter went into the house. Before he could speak, Jesus asked him, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the world collect fees or taxes? Is it from their family members or from other people?”
MAT.17.26	 “From other people,” Peter answered.
MAT.17.26	Jesus said to him, “Then the family members are exempt. 
MAT.17.27	 However, so that we don’t create a scandal, go to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that you catch. Open its mouth, and you will find a coin. Give that coin to them for you and me.”
MAT.18.1	 At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
MAT.18.2	 He called a little child and had him stand among them. 
MAT.18.3	 Then he said to them, “I can guarantee this truth: Unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.18.4	 Whoever becomes like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.18.5	 And whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me.
MAT.18.6	 “These little ones believe in me. It would be best for the person who causes one of them to lose faith to be drowned in the sea with a large stone hung around his neck. 
MAT.18.7	 How horrible it will be for the world because it causes people to lose their faith. Situations that cause people to lose their faith will arise. How horrible it will be for the person who causes someone to lose his faith!
MAT.18.8	 “If your hand or your foot causes you to lose your faith, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life disabled or injured than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into everlasting fire. 
MAT.18.9	 If your eye causes you to lose your faith, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire.
MAT.18.10	 “Be careful not to despise these little ones. I can guarantee that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father, who is in heaven.
MAT.18.12	 “What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep and one of them strays. Won’t he leave the 99 sheep in the hills to look for the one that has strayed? 
MAT.18.13	 I can guarantee this truth: If he finds it, he is happier about it than about the 99 that have not strayed. 
MAT.18.14	 In the same way, your Father in heaven does not want one of these little ones to be lost.
MAT.18.15	 “If a believer does something wrong,
MAT.18.16	 But if he does not listen, take one or two others with you so that every accusation may be verified by two or three witnesses. 
MAT.18.17	 If he ignores these witnesses, tell it to the community of believers. If he also ignores the community, deal with him as you would a heathen or a tax collector. 
MAT.18.18	 I can guarantee this truth: Whatever you imprison, God will imprison. And whatever you set free, God will set free.
MAT.18.19	 “I can guarantee again that if two of you agree on anything here on earth, my Father in heaven will accept it. 
MAT.18.20	 Where two or three have come together in my name, I am there among them.”
MAT.18.21	 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him, “Lord, how often do I have to forgive a believer who wrongs me? Seven times?”
MAT.18.22	 Jesus answered him, “I tell you, not just seven times, but seventy times seven.
MAT.18.23	 “That is why the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. 
MAT.18.24	 When he began to do this, a servant who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him. 
MAT.18.25	 Because he could not pay off the debt, the master ordered him, his wife, his children, and all that he had to be sold to pay off the account. 
MAT.18.26	 Then the servant fell at his master’s feet and said, ‘Be patient with me, and I will repay everything!’
MAT.18.27	 “The master felt sorry for his servant, freed him, and canceled his debt. 
MAT.18.28	 But when that servant went away, he found a servant who owed him hundreds of dollars. He grabbed the servant he found and began to choke him. ‘Pay what you owe!’ he said.
MAT.18.29	 “Then that other servant fell at his feet and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will repay you.’ 
MAT.18.30	 But he refused. Instead, he turned away and had that servant put into prison until he would repay what he owed.
MAT.18.31	 “The other servants who worked with him saw what had happened and felt very sad. They told their master the whole story.
MAT.18.32	 “Then his master sent for him and said to him, ‘You evil servant! I canceled your entire debt, because you begged me. 
MAT.18.33	 Shouldn’t you have treated the other servant as mercifully as I treated you?’
MAT.18.34	 “His master was so angry that he handed him over to the torturers until he would repay everything that he owed. 
MAT.18.35	 That is what my Father in heaven will do to you if each of you does not sincerely forgive other believers.”
MAT.19.1	 When Jesus finished speaking, he left Galilee and traveled along the other side of the Jordan River to the territory of Judea. 
MAT.19.2	 Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
MAT.19.3	 Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, “Can a man divorce his wife for any reason?”
MAT.19.4	 Jesus answered, “Haven’t you read that the Creator made them male and female in the beginning 
MAT.19.5	 and that he said, ‘That’s why a man will leave his father and mother and will remain united with his wife, and the two will be one’? 
MAT.19.6	 So they are no longer two but one. Therefore, don’t let anyone separate what God has joined together.”
MAT.19.7	 The Pharisees asked him, “Why, then, did Moses order a man to give his wife a written notice to divorce her?”
MAT.19.8	 Jesus answered them, “Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you’re heartless. It was never this way in the beginning. 
MAT.19.9	 I can guarantee that whoever divorces his wife for any reason other than her unfaithfulness is committing adultery if he marries another woman.”
MAT.19.10	 The disciples said to him, “If that is the only reason a man can use to divorce his wife, it’s better not to get married.”
MAT.19.11	 He answered them, “Not everyone can do what you suggest. Only those who have that gift can. 
MAT.19.12	 For example, some men are celibate because they were born that way. Others are celibate because they were castrated. Still others have decided to be celibate because of the kingdom of heaven. If anyone can do what you’ve suggested, then he should do it.”
MAT.19.13	 Then some people brought little children to Jesus to have him bless them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people not to do that.
MAT.19.14	 Jesus said, “Don’t stop children from coming to me! Children like these are part of the kingdom of God.” 
MAT.19.15	 After Jesus blessed them, he went away from there.
MAT.19.16	 Then a man came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, what good deed should I do to gain eternal life?”
MAT.19.17	 Jesus said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you want to enter into life, obey the commandments.”
MAT.19.18	 “Which commandments?” the man asked.
MAT.19.18	Jesus said, “Never murder. Never commit adultery. Never steal. Never give false testimony. 
MAT.19.19	 Honor your father and mother. Love your neighbor as you love yourself.”
MAT.19.20	 The young man replied, “I have obeyed all these commandments. What else do I need to do?”
MAT.19.21	 Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, sell what you own. Give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then follow me!”
MAT.19.22	 When the young man heard this, he went away sad because he owned a lot of property.
MAT.19.23	 Jesus said to his disciples, “I can guarantee this truth: It will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. 
MAT.19.24	 I can guarantee again that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”
MAT.19.25	 He amazed his disciples more than ever when they heard this. “Then who can be saved?” they asked.
MAT.19.26	 Jesus looked at them and said, “It is impossible for people ⌊to save themselves⌋, but everything is possible for God.”
MAT.19.27	 Then Peter replied to him, “Look, we’ve given up everything to follow you. What will we get out of it?”
MAT.19.28	 Jesus said to them, “I can guarantee this truth: When the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the world to come, you, my followers, will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
MAT.19.29	 And everyone who gave up homes, brothers or sisters, father, mother, children, or fields because of my name will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life. 
MAT.19.30	 However, many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
MAT.20.1	 “The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out at daybreak to hire workers for his vineyard. 
MAT.20.2	 After agreeing to pay the workers the usual day’s wages, he sent them to work in his vineyard. 
MAT.20.3	 About 9 a.m. he saw others standing in the marketplace without work. 
MAT.20.4	 He said to them, ‘Work in my vineyard, and I’ll give you whatever is right.’ So they went.
MAT.20.5	 “He went out again about noon and 3 p.m. and did the same thing. 
MAT.20.6	 About 5 p.m. he went out and found some others standing around. He said to them, ‘Why are you standing here all day long without work?’
MAT.20.7	 “‘No one has hired us,’ they answered him.
MAT.20.7	“He said to them, ‘Work in my vineyard.’
MAT.20.8	 “When evening came, the owner of the vineyard told the supervisor, ‘Call the workers, and give them their wages. Start with the last, and end with the first.’
MAT.20.9	 “Those who started working about 5 p.m. came, and each received a day’s wages. 
MAT.20.10	 When those who had been hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them received a day’s wages. 
MAT.20.11	 Although they took it, they began to protest to the owner. 
MAT.20.12	 They said, ‘These last workers have worked only one hour. Yet, you’ve treated us all the same, even though we worked hard all day under a blazing sun.’
MAT.20.13	 “The owner said to one of them, ‘Friend, I’m not treating you unfairly. Didn’t you agree with me on a day’s wages? 
MAT.20.14	 Take your money and go! I want to give this last worker as much as I gave you. 
MAT.20.15	 Can’t I do what I want with my own money? Or do you resent my generosity towards others?’
MAT.20.16	 “In this way the last will be first, and the first will be last.”
MAT.20.17	 When Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took the twelve apostles aside and said to them privately, 
MAT.20.18	 “We’re going to Jerusalem. There the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings. They will condemn him to death 
MAT.20.19	 and hand him over to foreigners. They will make fun of him, whip him, and crucify him. But on the third day he will be brought back to life.”
MAT.20.20	 Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her two sons. She bowed down in front of him to ask him for a favor.
MAT.20.21	 “What do you want?” he asked her.
MAT.20.21	She said to him, “Promise that one of my sons will sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.”
MAT.20.22	 Jesus replied, “You don’t realize what you’re asking. Can you drink the cup that I’m going to drink?”
MAT.20.22	“We can,” they told him.
MAT.20.23	 Jesus said to them, “You will drink my cup. But I don’t have the authority to grant you a seat at my right or left. My Father has already prepared these positions for certain people.”
MAT.20.24	 When the other ten apostles heard about this, they were irritated with the two brothers. 
MAT.20.25	 Jesus called the apostles and said, “You know that the rulers of nations have absolute power over people and their officials have absolute authority over people. 
MAT.20.26	 But that’s not the way it’s going to be among you. Whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant. 
MAT.20.27	 Whoever wants to be most important among you will be your slave. 
MAT.20.28	 It’s the same way with the Son of Man. He didn’t come so that others could serve him. He came to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people.”
MAT.20.29	 As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Jesus. 
MAT.20.30	 Two blind men were sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
MAT.20.31	 The crowd told them to be quiet. But they shouted even louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
MAT.20.32	 Jesus stopped and called them. “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.
MAT.20.33	 They told him, “Lord, we want you to give us our eyesight back.”
MAT.20.34	 Jesus felt sorry for them, so he touched their eyes. Their sight was restored at once, and they followed him.
MAT.21.1	 When they came near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples ahead of him. 
MAT.21.2	 He said to them, “Go into the village ahead of you. You will find a donkey tied there and a colt with it. Untie them, and bring them to me. 
MAT.21.3	 If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them. That person will send them at once.”
MAT.21.4	 This happened so that what the prophet had said came true:
MAT.21.5	 “Tell the people of Zion,
MAT.21.5	‘Your king is coming to you.
MAT.21.5	He’s gentle,
MAT.21.5	riding on a donkey,
MAT.21.5	on a colt, a young pack animal.’ ”
MAT.21.6	 The disciples did as Jesus had directed them. 
MAT.21.7	 They brought the donkey and the colt and put their coats on them for Jesus to sit on. 
MAT.21.8	 Most of the people spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 
MAT.21.9	 The crowd that went ahead of him and that followed him was shouting,
MAT.21.9	“Hosanna to the Son of David!
MAT.21.9	Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!
MAT.21.9	Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
MAT.21.10	 When Jesus came into Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar. People were asking, “Who is this?”
MAT.21.11	 The crowd answered, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.”
MAT.21.12	 Jesus went into the temple courtyard and threw out everyone who was buying and selling there. He overturned the moneychangers’ tables and the chairs of those who sold pigeons. 
MAT.21.13	 He told them, “Scripture says, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you’re turning it into a gathering place for thieves!”
MAT.21.14	 Blind and lame people came to him in the temple courtyard, and he healed them.
MAT.21.15	 When the chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings saw the amazing miracles he performed and the children shouting in the temple courtyard, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were irritated. 
MAT.21.16	 They said to him, “Do you hear what these children are saying?”
MAT.21.16	Jesus replied, “Yes, I do. Have you never read, ‘From the mouths of little children and infants, you have created praise’?”
MAT.21.17	 He left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.
MAT.21.18	 In the morning, as Jesus returned to the city, he became hungry. 
MAT.21.19	 When he saw a fig tree by the road, he went up to the tree and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to the tree, “May fruit never grow on you again!” At once the fig tree dried up.
MAT.21.20	 The disciples were surprised to see this. They asked, “How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?”
MAT.21.21	 Jesus answered them, “I can guarantee this truth: If you have faith and do not doubt, you will be able to do what I did to the fig tree. You could also say to this mountain, ‘Be uprooted and thrown into the sea,’ and it will happen. 
MAT.21.22	 Have faith that you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”
MAT.21.23	 Then Jesus went into the temple courtyard and began to teach. The chief priests and the leaders of the people came to him. They asked, “What gives you the right to do these things? Who told you that you could do this?”
MAT.21.24	 Jesus answered them, “I, too, have a question for you. If you answer it for me, I’ll tell you why I have the right to do these things. 
MAT.21.25	 Did John’s right to baptize come from heaven or from humans?”
MAT.21.25	They discussed this among themselves. They said, “If we say, ‘from heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 
MAT.21.26	 But if we say, ‘from humans,’ we’re afraid of what the crowd might do. All those people think of John as a prophet.” 
MAT.21.27	 So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”
MAT.21.27	Jesus told them, “Then I won’t tell you why I have the right to do these things.
MAT.21.28	 “What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go to work in the vineyard today.’
MAT.21.29	 “His son replied, ‘I don’t want to!’ But later he changed his mind and went.
MAT.21.30	 “The father went to the other son and told him the same thing. He replied, ‘I will, sir,’ but he didn’t go.
MAT.21.31	 “Which of the two sons did what the father wanted?”
MAT.21.31	“The first,” they answered.
MAT.21.31	Jesus said to them, “I can guarantee this truth: Tax collectors and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you. 
MAT.21.32	 John came to you and showed you the way that God wants you to live, but you didn’t believe him. The tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. But even after you had seen that, you didn’t change your minds and believe him.
MAT.21.33	 “Listen to another illustration. A landowner planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, made a winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to vineyard workers and went on a trip.
MAT.21.34	 “When the grapes were getting ripe, he sent his servants to the workers to collect his share of the produce. 
MAT.21.35	 The workers took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned a third to death. 
MAT.21.36	 So the landowner sent more servants. But the workers treated them the same way.
MAT.21.37	 “Finally, he sent his son to them. He thought, ‘They will respect my son.’
MAT.21.38	 “When the workers saw his son, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Let’s kill him and get his inheritance.’ 
MAT.21.39	 So they grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
MAT.21.40	 “Now, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those workers?”
MAT.21.41	 They answered, “He will destroy those evil people. Then he will lease the vineyard to other workers who will give him his share of the produce when it is ready.”
MAT.21.42	 Jesus asked them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures:
MAT.21.42	‘The stone that the builders rejected
MAT.21.42	has become the cornerstone.
MAT.21.42	The Lord is responsible for this,
MAT.21.42	and it is amazing for us to see’?
MAT.21.43	 That is why I can guarantee that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce what God wants. 
MAT.21.44	 Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken. If the stone falls on anyone, it will crush that person.” 
MAT.21.45	 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his illustrations, they knew that he was talking about them. 
MAT.21.46	 They wanted to arrest him but were afraid of the crowds, who thought he was a prophet.
MAT.22.1	 Again Jesus used stories as illustrations when he spoke to them. He said, 
MAT.22.2	 “The kingdom of heaven is like a king who planned a wedding for his son. 
MAT.22.3	 He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the wedding, but they refused to come. 
MAT.22.4	 He sent other servants to tell the people who had been invited, ‘I’ve prepared dinner. My bulls and fattened calves have been butchered. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding!’
MAT.22.5	 “But they paid no attention and went away. Some went to work in their own fields, and others went to their businesses. 
MAT.22.6	 The rest grabbed the king’s servants, mistreated them, and then killed them.
MAT.22.7	 “The king became angry. He sent his soldiers, killed those murderers, and burned their city.
MAT.22.8	 “Then the king said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited don’t deserve the honor. 
MAT.22.9	 Go where the roads leave the city. Invite everyone you find to the wedding.’ 
MAT.22.10	 The servants went into the streets and brought in all the good people and all the evil people they found. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.
MAT.22.11	 “When the king came to see the guests, he saw a person who was not dressed in the wedding clothes ⌊provided for the guests⌋. 
MAT.22.12	 He said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without proper wedding clothes?’
MAT.22.12	“The man had nothing to say. 
MAT.22.13	 Then the king told his servants, ‘Tie his hands and feet, and throw him outside into the darkness. People will cry and be in extreme pain there.’
MAT.22.14	 “Therefore, many are invited, but few of those are chosen to stay.”
MAT.22.15	 Then the Pharisees went away and planned to trap Jesus into saying the wrong thing. 
MAT.22.16	 They sent their disciples to him along with Herod’s followers. They said to him, “Teacher, we know that you tell the truth and that you teach the truth about the way of God. You don’t favor individuals because of who they are. 
MAT.22.17	 So tell us what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to the emperor or not?”
MAT.22.18	 Jesus recognized their evil plan, so he asked, “Why do you test me, you hypocrites? 
MAT.22.19	 Show me a coin used to pay taxes.”
MAT.22.19	They brought him a coin. 
MAT.22.20	 He said to them, “Whose face and name is this?”
MAT.22.21	 They replied, “The emperor’s.”
MAT.22.21	Then he said to them, “Very well, give the emperor what belongs to the emperor, and give God what belongs to God.”
MAT.22.22	 They were surprised to hear this. Then they left him alone and went away.
MAT.22.23	 On that day some Sadducees, who say that people will never come back to life, came to Jesus. They asked him, 
MAT.22.24	 “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies childless, his brother should marry his widow and have children for his brother.’ 
MAT.22.25	 There were seven brothers among us. The first married and died. Since he had no children, he left his widow to his brother. 
MAT.22.26	 The second brother also died, as well as the third, and the rest of the seven brothers. 
MAT.22.27	 At last the woman died. 
MAT.22.28	 Now, when the dead come back to life, whose wife will she be? All seven brothers had been married to her.”
MAT.22.29	 Jesus answered, “You’re mistaken because you don’t know the Scriptures or God’s power. 
MAT.22.30	 When people come back to life, they don’t marry. Rather, they are like the angels in heaven. 
MAT.22.31	 Haven’t you read what God told you about the dead coming back to life? He said, 
MAT.22.32	 ‘I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ He’s not the God of the dead but of the living.”
MAT.22.33	 He amazed the crowds who heard his teaching.
MAT.22.34	 When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. 
MAT.22.35	 One of them, an expert in Moses’ Teachings, tested Jesus by asking, 
MAT.22.36	 “Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in Moses’ Teachings?”
MAT.22.37	 Jesus answered him, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ 
MAT.22.38	 This is the greatest and most important commandment. 
MAT.22.39	 The second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ 
MAT.22.40	 All of Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets depend on these two commandments.”
MAT.22.41	 While the Pharisees were still gathered, Jesus asked them, 
MAT.22.42	 “What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?”
MAT.22.42	They answered him, “David’s.”
MAT.22.43	 He said to them, “Then how can David, guided by the Spirit, call him Lord? David says,
MAT.22.44	 ‘The Lord said to my Lord,
MAT.22.44	“Take the highest position in heaven
MAT.22.44	until I put your enemies under your control.” ’
MAT.22.45	 If David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?”
MAT.22.46	 No one could answer him, and from that time on no one dared to ask him another question.
MAT.23.1	 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 
MAT.23.2	 “The experts in Moses’ Teachings and the Pharisees teach with Moses’ authority. 
MAT.23.3	 So be careful to do everything they tell you. But don’t follow their example, because they don’t practice what they preach. 
MAT.23.4	 They make loads that are hard to carry and lay them on the shoulders of the people. However, they are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
MAT.23.5	 “They do everything to attract people’s attention. They make their headbands large and the tassels on their shawls long. 
MAT.23.6	 They love the place of honor at dinners and the front seats in synagogues. 
MAT.23.7	 They love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have people call them Rabbi. 
MAT.23.8	 But don’t make others call you Rabbi, because you have only one teacher, and you are all followers. 
MAT.23.9	 And don’t call anyone on earth your father, because you have only one Father, and he is in heaven. 
MAT.23.10	 Don’t make others call you a leader, because you have only one leader, the Messiah. 
MAT.23.11	 The person who is greatest among you will be your servant. 
MAT.23.12	 Whoever honors himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be honored.
MAT.23.13	 “How horrible it will be for you, experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You don’t enter it yourselves, and you don’t permit others to enter when they try.
MAT.23.15	 “How horrible it will be for you, experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You cross land and sea to recruit a single follower, and when you do, you make that person twice as fit for hell as you are.
MAT.23.16	 “How horrible it will be for you, you blind guides! You say, ‘To swear an oath by the temple doesn’t mean a thing. But to swear an oath by the gold in the temple means a person must keep his oath.’ 
MAT.23.17	 You blind fools! What is more important, the gold or the temple that made the gold holy? 
MAT.23.18	 Again you say, ‘To swear an oath by the altar doesn’t mean a thing. But to swear an oath by the gift on the altar means a person must keep his oath.’ 
MAT.23.19	 You blind men! What is more important, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy? 
MAT.23.20	 To swear an oath by the altar is to swear by it and by everything on it. 
MAT.23.21	 To swear an oath by the temple is to swear by it and by the one who lives there. 
MAT.23.22	 And to swear an oath by heaven is to swear by God’s throne and the one who sits on it.
MAT.23.23	 “How horrible it will be for you, experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give ⌊God⌋ one-tenth of your mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected justice, mercy, and faithfulness. These are the most important things in Moses’ Teachings. You should have done these things without neglecting the others. 
MAT.23.24	 You blind guides! You strain gnats ⌊out of your wine⌋, but you swallow camels.
MAT.23.25	 “How horrible it will be for you, experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of cups and dishes. But inside they are full of greed and uncontrolled desires. 
MAT.23.26	 You blind Pharisees! First clean the inside of the cups and dishes so that the outside may also be clean.
MAT.23.27	 “How horrible it will be for you, experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed graves that look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead people’s bones and every kind of impurity. 
MAT.23.28	 So on the outside you look as though you have God’s approval, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
MAT.23.29	 “How horrible it will be for you, experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of those who had God’s approval. 
MAT.23.30	 Then you say, ‘If we had lived at the time of our ancestors, we would not have helped to murder the prophets.’ 
MAT.23.31	 So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. 
MAT.23.32	 Go ahead, finish what your ancestors started!
MAT.23.33	 “You snakes! You poisonous snakes! How can you escape being condemned to hell? 
MAT.23.34	 I’m sending you prophets, wise men, and teachers of the Scriptures. You will kill and crucify some of them. Others you will whip in your synagogues and persecute from city to city. 
MAT.23.35	 As a result, you will be held accountable for all the innocent blood of those murdered on earth, from the murder of righteous Abel to that of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. 
MAT.23.36	 I can guarantee this truth: The people living now will be held accountable for all these things.
MAT.23.37	 “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you kill the prophets and stone to death those sent to you! How often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings! But you were not willing! 
MAT.23.38	 Your house will be abandoned, deserted. 
MAT.23.39	 I can guarantee that you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’ ”
MAT.24.1	 As Jesus left the temple courtyard and was walking away, his disciples came to him. They proudly pointed out to him the temple buildings. 
MAT.24.2	 Jesus said to them, “You see all these buildings, don’t you? I can guarantee this truth: Not one of these stones will be left on top of another. Each one will be torn down.”
MAT.24.3	 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said, “Tell us, when will this happen? What will be the sign that you are coming again, and when will the world come to an end?”
MAT.24.4	 Jesus answered them, “Be careful not to let anyone deceive you. 
MAT.24.5	 Many will come using my name. They will say, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and they will deceive many people.
MAT.24.6	 “You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Don’t be alarmed! These things must happen, but they don’t mean that the end has come. 
MAT.24.7	 Nation will fight against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 
MAT.24.8	 All of these are only the beginning pains ⌊of the end⌋.
MAT.24.9	 “Then they will hand you over to those who will torture and kill you. All nations will hate you because you are committed to me. 
MAT.24.10	 Then many will lose faith. They will betray and hate each other. 
MAT.24.11	 Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 
MAT.24.12	 And because there will be more and more lawlessness, most people’s love will grow cold. 
MAT.24.13	 But the person who endures to the end will be saved.
MAT.24.14	 “This Good News about the kingdom will be spread throughout the world as a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
MAT.24.15	 “The prophet Daniel said that the disgusting thing that will cause destruction will stand in the holy place. When you see this (let the reader take note), 
MAT.24.16	 those of you in Judea should flee to the mountains. 
MAT.24.17	 Those who are on the roof should not come down to get anything out of their houses. 
MAT.24.18	 Those who are in the field should not turn back to get their coats.
MAT.24.19	 “How horrible it will be for the women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days. 
MAT.24.20	 Pray that it will not be winter or a day of worship when you flee. 
MAT.24.21	 There will be a lot of misery at that time, a kind of misery that has not happened from the beginning of the world until now and will certainly never happen again. 
MAT.24.22	 If God does not reduce the number of those days, no one will be saved. But those days will be reduced because of those whom God has chosen.
MAT.24.23	 “At that time don’t believe anyone who tells you, ‘Here is the Messiah!’ or ‘There he is!’ 
MAT.24.24	 False messiahs and false prophets will appear. They will work spectacular, miraculous signs and do wonderful things to deceive, if possible, even those whom God has chosen. 
MAT.24.25	 Listen! I’ve told you this before it happens. 
MAT.24.26	 So if someone tells you, ‘He’s in the desert!’ don’t go out ⌊looking for him⌋. And don’t believe anyone who says, ‘He’s in a secret place!’ 
MAT.24.27	 The Son of Man will come again just as lightning flashes from east to west. 
MAT.24.28	 Vultures will gather wherever there is a dead body.
MAT.24.29	 “Immediately after the misery of those days, the sun will turn dark, the moon will not give light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the universe will be shaken.
MAT.24.30	 “Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the people on earth will cry in agony when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds in the sky with power and great glory. 
MAT.24.31	 He will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and from every direction under the sky, they will gather those whom God has chosen.
MAT.24.32	 “Learn from the story of the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and it sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near. 
MAT.24.33	 In the same way, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the door.
MAT.24.34	 “I can guarantee this truth: This generation will not disappear until all these things take place. 
MAT.24.35	 The earth and the heavens will disappear, but my words will never disappear.
MAT.24.36	 “No one knows when that day or hour will come. Even the angels in heaven and the Son don’t know. Only the Father knows.
MAT.24.37	 “When the Son of Man comes again, it will be exactly like the days of Noah. 
MAT.24.38	 In the days before the flood, people were eating, drinking, and getting married until the day that Noah went into the ship. 
MAT.24.39	 They were not aware of what was happening until the flood came and swept all of them away. That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes again.
MAT.24.40	 “At that time two men will be working in the field. One will be taken, and the other one will be left. 
MAT.24.41	 Two women will be working at a mill. One will be taken, and the other one will be left.
MAT.24.42	 “Therefore, be alert, because you don’t know on what day your Lord will return. 
MAT.24.43	 You realize that if a homeowner had known at what time of the night a thief was coming, he would have stayed awake. He would not have let the thief break into his house. 
MAT.24.44	 Therefore, you, too, must be ready because the Son of Man will return when you least expect him.
MAT.24.45	 “Who, then, is the faithful and wise servant? The master will put that person in charge of giving the other servants their food at the right time. 
MAT.24.46	 That servant will be blessed if his master finds him doing this job when he comes. 
MAT.24.47	 I can guarantee this truth: He will put that servant in charge of all his property. 
MAT.24.48	 On the other hand, that servant, if he is wicked, may think that it will be a long time before his master comes. 
MAT.24.49	 The servant may begin to beat the other servants and eat and drink with the drunks. 
MAT.24.50	 His master will return unexpectedly. 
MAT.24.51	 Then his master will severely punish him and assign him a place with the hypocrites. People will cry and be in extreme pain there.
MAT.25.1	 “When the end comes, the kingdom of heaven will be like ten bridesmaids. They took their oil lamps and went to meet the groom. 
MAT.25.2	 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 
MAT.25.3	 The foolish bridesmaids took their lamps, but they didn’t take any extra oil. 
MAT.25.4	 The wise bridesmaids, however, took along extra oil for their lamps. 
MAT.25.5	 Since the groom was late, all the bridesmaids became drowsy and fell asleep.
MAT.25.6	 “At midnight someone shouted, ‘The groom is here! Come to meet him!’ 
MAT.25.7	 Then all the bridesmaids woke up and got their lamps ready.
MAT.25.8	 “The foolish ones said to the wise ones, ‘Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out.’
MAT.25.9	 “But the wise bridesmaids replied, ‘We can’t do that. There won’t be enough for both of us. Go! Find someone to sell you some oil.’
MAT.25.10	 “While they were buying oil, the groom arrived. The bridesmaids who were ready went with him into the wedding hall, and the door was shut.
MAT.25.11	 “Later the other bridesmaids arrived and said, ‘Sir, sir, open the door for us!’
MAT.25.12	 “But he answered them, ‘I don’t even know who you are!’
MAT.25.13	 “So stay awake, because you don’t know the day or the hour.
MAT.25.14	 “The kingdom of heaven is like a man going on a trip. He called his servants and entrusted some money to them. 
MAT.25.15	 He gave one man ten thousand dollars, another four thousand dollars, and another two thousand dollars. Each was given money based on his ability. Then the man went on his trip.
MAT.25.16	 “The one who received ten thousand dollars invested the money at once and doubled his money. 
MAT.25.17	 The one who had four thousand dollars did the same and also doubled his money. 
MAT.25.18	 But the one who received two thousand dollars went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money.
MAT.25.19	 “After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 
MAT.25.20	 The one who received ten thousand dollars brought the additional ten thousand. He said, ‘Sir, you gave me ten thousand dollars. I’ve doubled the amount.’
MAT.25.21	 “His master replied, ‘Good job! You’re a good and faithful servant! You proved that you could be trusted with a small amount. I will put you in charge of a large amount. Come and share your master’s happiness.’
MAT.25.22	 “The one who received four thousand dollars came and said, ‘Sir, you gave me four thousand dollars. I’ve doubled the amount.’
MAT.25.23	 “His master replied, ‘Good job! You’re a good and faithful servant! You proved that you could be trusted with a small amount. I will put you in charge of a large amount. Come and share your master’s happiness.’
MAT.25.24	 “Then the one who received two thousand dollars came and said, ‘Sir, I knew that you are a hard person to please. You harvest where you haven’t planted and gather where you haven’t scattered any seeds. 
MAT.25.25	 I was afraid. So I hid your two thousand dollars in the ground. Here’s your money!’
MAT.25.26	 “His master responded, ‘You evil and lazy servant! If you knew that I harvest where I haven’t planted and gather where I haven’t scattered, 
MAT.25.27	 then you should have invested my money with the bankers. When I returned, I would have received my money back with interest. 
MAT.25.28	 Take the two thousand dollars away from him! Give it to the one who has the ten thousand! 
MAT.25.29	 To all who have, more will be given, and they will have more than enough. But everything will be taken away from those who don’t have much. 
MAT.25.30	 Throw this useless servant outside into the darkness. People will cry and be in extreme pain there.’
MAT.25.31	 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all his angels are with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 
MAT.25.32	 The people of every nation will be gathered in front of him. He will separate them as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 
MAT.25.33	 He will put the sheep on his right but the goats on his left.
MAT.25.34	 “Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, my Father has blessed you! Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world. 
MAT.25.35	 I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you took me into your home. 
MAT.25.36	 I needed clothes, and you gave me something to wear. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.’
MAT.25.37	 “Then the people who have God’s approval will reply to him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you or see you thirsty and give you something to drink? 
MAT.25.38	 When did we see you as a stranger and take you into our homes or see you in need of clothes and give you something to wear? 
MAT.25.39	 When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’
MAT.25.40	 “The king will answer them, ‘I can guarantee this truth: Whatever you did for one of my brothers or sisters, no matter how unimportant ⌊they seemed⌋, you did for me.’
MAT.25.41	 “Then the king will say to those on his left, ‘Get away from me! God has cursed you! Go into everlasting fire that was prepared for the devil and his angels! 
MAT.25.42	 I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink. 
MAT.25.43	 I was a stranger, and you didn’t take me into your homes. I needed clothes, and you didn’t give me anything to wear. I was sick and in prison, and you didn’t take care of me.’
MAT.25.44	 “They, too, will ask, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or as a stranger or in need of clothes or sick or in prison and didn’t help you?’
MAT.25.45	 “He will answer them, ‘I can guarantee this truth: Whatever you failed to do for one of my brothers or sisters, no matter how unimportant ⌊they seemed⌋, you failed to do for me.’
MAT.25.46	 “These people will go away into eternal punishment, but those with God’s approval will go into eternal life.”
MAT.26.1	 When Jesus finished saying all these things, he told his disciples, 
MAT.26.2	 “You know that the Passover will take place in two days. At that time the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”
MAT.26.3	 Then the chief priests and the leaders of the people gathered in the palace of the chief priest Caiaphas. 
MAT.26.4	 They made plans to arrest Jesus in an underhanded way and to kill him. 
MAT.26.5	 But they said, “We shouldn’t arrest him during the festival, or else there may be a riot among the people.”
MAT.26.6	 Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon, a man who had suffered from a skin disease. 
MAT.26.7	 While Jesus was sitting there, a woman went to him with a bottle of very expensive perfume and poured it on his head.
MAT.26.8	 The disciples were irritated when they saw this. They asked, “Why did she waste it like this? 
MAT.26.9	 It could have been sold for a high price, and the money could have been given to the poor.”
MAT.26.10	 Since Jesus knew what was going on, he said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me. 
MAT.26.11	 You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me with you. 
MAT.26.12	 She poured this perfume on my body before it is placed in a tomb. 
MAT.26.13	 I can guarantee this truth: Wherever this Good News is spoken in the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”
MAT.26.14	 Then one of the twelve apostles, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests. 
MAT.26.15	 He asked, “What will you pay me if I hand him over to you?”
MAT.26.15	They offered him 30 silver coins. 
MAT.26.16	 From then on, he looked for a chance to betray Jesus.
MAT.26.17	 On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples went to Jesus. They asked, “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?”
MAT.26.18	 He said, “Go to a certain man in the city, and tell him that the teacher says, ‘My time is near. I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.’ ”
MAT.26.19	 The disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
MAT.26.20	 When evening came, Jesus was at the table with the twelve apostles.
MAT.26.21	 While they were eating, he said, “I can guarantee this truth: One of you is going to betray me.”
MAT.26.22	 Feeling deeply hurt, they asked him one by one, “You don’t mean me, do you, Lord?”
MAT.26.23	 Jesus answered, “Someone who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. 
MAT.26.24	 The Son of Man is going to die as the Scriptures say he will. But how horrible it will be for that person who betrays the Son of Man. It would have been better for that person if he had never been born.”
MAT.26.25	 Then Judas, who betrayed him, asked, “You don’t mean me, do you, Rabbi?”
MAT.26.25	“Yes, I do,” Jesus replied.
MAT.26.26	 While they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it. He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take this, and eat it. This is my body.”
MAT.26.27	 Then he took a cup and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving. He gave it to them and said, “Drink from it, all of you. 
MAT.26.28	 This is my blood, the blood of the promise.
MAT.26.29	 “I can guarantee that I won’t drink this wine again until that day when I drink new wine with you in my Father’s kingdom.”
MAT.26.30	 After they sang a hymn, they went to the Mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	 Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will abandon me tonight. Scripture says,
MAT.26.31	‘I will strike the shepherd,
MAT.26.31	and the sheep in the flock will be scattered.’
MAT.26.32	 “But after I am brought back to life, I will go to Galilee ahead of you.”
MAT.26.33	 Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else abandons you, I never will.”
MAT.26.34	 Jesus replied to Peter, “I can guarantee this truth: Before a rooster crows tonight, you will say three times that you don’t know me.”
MAT.26.35	 Peter told him, “Even if I have to die with you, I’ll never say that I don’t know you!” All the other disciples said the same thing.
MAT.26.36	 Then Jesus went with the disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, “Stay here while I go over there and pray.”
MAT.26.37	 He took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons with him. He was beginning to feel deep anguish. 
MAT.26.38	 Then he said to them, “My anguish is so great that I feel as if I’m dying. Wait here, and stay awake with me.”
MAT.26.39	 After walking a little farther, he quickly bowed with his face to the ground and prayed, “Father, if it’s possible, let this cup ⌊of suffering⌋ be taken away from me. But let your will be done rather than mine.”
MAT.26.40	 When he went back to the disciples, he found them asleep. He said to Peter, “Couldn’t you stay awake with me for one hour? 
MAT.26.41	 Stay awake, and pray that you won’t be tempted. You want to do what’s right, but you’re weak.”
MAT.26.42	 Then he went away a second time and prayed, “Father, if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, let your will be done.”
MAT.26.43	 He found them asleep again because they couldn’t keep their eyes open.
MAT.26.44	 After leaving them again, he went away and prayed the same prayer a third time. 
MAT.26.45	 Then he came back to the disciples and said to them, “You might as well sleep now. The time is near for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners. 
MAT.26.46	 Get up! Let’s go! The one who is betraying me is near.”
MAT.26.47	 Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve apostles, arrived. A large crowd carrying swords and clubs was with him. They were from the chief priests and leaders of the people. 
MAT.26.48	 Now, the traitor had given them a signal. He said, “The one I kiss is the man you want. Arrest him!”
MAT.26.49	 Then Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, “Hello, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
MAT.26.50	 Jesus said to him, “Friend, why are you here?”
MAT.26.50	Then some men came forward, took hold of Jesus, and arrested him. 
MAT.26.51	 Suddenly, one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of the chief priest’s servant. 
MAT.26.52	 Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword away! All who use a sword will be killed by a sword. 
MAT.26.53	 Don’t you think that I could call on my Father to send more than twelve legions of angels to help me now? 
MAT.26.54	 How, then, are the Scriptures to be fulfilled that say this must happen?”
MAT.26.55	 At that time Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a criminal? I used to sit teaching in the temple courtyard every day. But you didn’t arrest me then. 
MAT.26.56	 All of this has happened so that what the prophets have written would come true.”
MAT.26.56	Then all the disciples abandoned him and ran away.
MAT.26.57	 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the chief priest, where the experts in Moses’ Teachings and the leaders had gathered together. 
MAT.26.58	 Peter followed at a distance until he came to the chief priest’s courtyard. He went inside and sat with the guards to see how this would turn out.
MAT.26.59	 The chief priests and the whole council were searching for false testimony to use against Jesus in order to execute him. 
MAT.26.60	 But they did not find any, although many came forward with false testimony. At last two men came forward. 
MAT.26.61	 They stated, “This man said, ‘I can tear down God’s temple and rebuild it in three days.’ ”
MAT.26.62	 The chief priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Don’t you have any answer to what these men testify against you?”
MAT.26.63	 But Jesus was silent.
MAT.26.63	Then the chief priest said to him, “Swear an oath in front of the living God and tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of God?”
MAT.26.64	 Jesus answered him, “Yes, I am. But I can guarantee that from now on you will see the Son of Man in the highest position in heaven. He will be coming on the clouds of heaven.”
MAT.26.65	 Then the chief priest tore his robes in horror and said, “He has dishonored God! Why do we need any more witnesses? You’ve just heard him dishonor God! 
MAT.26.66	 What’s your verdict?”
MAT.26.66	They answered, “He deserves the death penalty!”
MAT.26.67	 Then they spit in his face, hit him with their fists, and some of them slapped him. 
MAT.26.68	 They said, “You Christ, if you’re a prophet, tell us who hit you.”
MAT.26.69	 Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came to him and said, “You, too, were with Jesus the Galilean.”
MAT.26.70	 But Peter denied it in front of them all by saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
MAT.26.71	 As he went to the entrance, another female servant saw him. She told those who were there, “This man was with Jesus from Nazareth.”
MAT.26.72	 Again Peter denied it and swore with an oath, “I don’t know the man!”
MAT.26.73	 After a little while the men standing there approached Peter and said, “It’s obvious you’re also one of them. Your accent gives you away!”
MAT.26.74	 Then Peter began to curse and swear with an oath, “I don’t know the man!” Just then a rooster crowed. 
MAT.26.75	 Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before a rooster crows, you will say three times that you don’t know me.” Then Peter went outside and cried bitterly.
MAT.27.1	 Early in the morning all the chief priests and the leaders of the people decided to execute Jesus. 
MAT.27.2	 They tied him up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
MAT.27.3	 Then Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, regretted what had happened when he saw that Jesus was condemned. He brought the 30 silver coins back to the chief priests and leaders. 
MAT.27.4	 He said, “I’ve sinned by betraying an innocent man.”
MAT.27.4	They replied, “What do we care? That’s your problem.”
MAT.27.5	 So he threw the money into the temple, went away, and hanged himself.
MAT.27.6	 The chief priests took the money and said, “It’s not right to put it into the temple treasury, because it’s blood money.” 
MAT.27.7	 So they decided to use it to buy a potter’s field for the burial of strangers. 
MAT.27.8	 That’s why that field has been called the Field of Blood ever since. 
MAT.27.9	 Then what the prophet Jeremiah had said came true, “They took the 30 silver coins, the price the people of Israel had placed on him, 
MAT.27.10	 and used the coins to buy a potter’s field, as the Lord had directed me.”
MAT.27.11	 Jesus stood in front of the governor, ⌊Pilate⌋. The governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
MAT.27.11	“Yes, I am,” Jesus answered.
MAT.27.12	 While the chief priests and leaders were accusing him, he said nothing. 
MAT.27.13	 Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear how many charges they’re bringing against you?”
MAT.27.14	 But Jesus said absolutely nothing to him in reply, so the governor was very surprised.
MAT.27.15	 At every Passover festival the governor would free one prisoner whom the crowd wanted. 
MAT.27.16	 At that time there was a well-known prisoner by the name of Barabbas. 
MAT.27.17	 So when the people gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which man do you want me to free for you? Do you want me to free Barabbas or Jesus, who is called Christ?” 
MAT.27.18	 Pilate knew that they had handed Jesus over to him because they were jealous.
MAT.27.19	 While Pilate was judging the case, his wife sent him a message. It said, “Leave that innocent man alone. I’ve been very upset today because of a dream I had about him.”
MAT.27.20	 But the chief priests and leaders persuaded the crowd to ask for the release of Barabbas and the execution of Jesus.
MAT.27.21	 The governor asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to free for you?”
MAT.27.21	They said, “Barabbas.”
MAT.27.22	 Pilate asked them, “Then what should I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?”
MAT.27.22	“He should be crucified!” they all said.
MAT.27.23	 Pilate asked, “Why? What has he done wrong?”
MAT.27.23	But they began to shout loudly, “He should be crucified!”
MAT.27.24	 Pilate saw that he was not getting anywhere. Instead, a riot was breaking out. So Pilate took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. He said, “I won’t be guilty of killing this man. Do what you want!”
MAT.27.25	 All the people answered, “The responsibility for killing him will rest on us and our children.”
MAT.27.26	 Then Pilate freed Barabbas for the people. But he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified.
MAT.27.27	 Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the palace and gathered the whole troop around him. 
MAT.27.28	 They took off his clothes and put a bright red cape on him. 
MAT.27.29	 They twisted some thorns into a crown, placed it on his head, and put a stick in his right hand. They knelt in front of him and made fun of him by saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” 
MAT.27.30	 After they had spit on him, they took the stick and kept hitting him on the head with it.
MAT.27.31	 After the soldiers finished making fun of Jesus, they took off the cape and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.
MAT.27.32	 On the way they found a man named Simon. He was from the city of Cyrene. The soldiers forced him to carry Jesus’ cross.
MAT.27.33	 They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”). 
MAT.27.34	 They gave him a drink of wine mixed with a drug called gall. When he tasted it, he refused to drink it. 
MAT.27.35	 After they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by throwing dice. 
MAT.27.36	 Then they sat there and kept watch over him. 
MAT.27.37	 They placed a written accusation above his head. It read, “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”
MAT.27.38	 At that time they crucified two criminals with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
MAT.27.39	 Those who passed by insulted him. They shook their heads 
MAT.27.40	 and said, “You were going to tear down God’s temple and build it again in three days. Save yourself! If you’re the Son of God, come down from the cross.” 
MAT.27.41	 The chief priests together with the experts in Moses’ Teachings and the leaders made fun of him in the same way. They said, 
MAT.27.42	 “He saved others, but he can’t save himself. So he’s Israel’s king! Let him come down from the cross now, and we’ll believe him. 
MAT.27.43	 He trusted God. Let God rescue him now if he wants. After all, this man said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” 
MAT.27.44	 Even the criminals crucified with him were insulting him the same way.
MAT.27.45	 At noon darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. 
MAT.27.46	 About three o’clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” 
MAT.27.47	 When some of the people standing there heard him say that, they said, “He’s calling Elijah.” 
MAT.27.48	 One of the men ran at once, took a sponge, and soaked it in some vinegar. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink. 
MAT.27.49	 The others said, “Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.”
MAT.27.50	 Then Jesus loudly cried out once again and gave up his life.
MAT.27.51	 Suddenly, the curtain in the temple was split in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split open. 
MAT.27.52	 The tombs were opened, and the bodies of many holy people who had died came back to life. 
MAT.27.53	 They came out of the tombs after he had come back to life, and they went into the holy city where they appeared to many people.
MAT.27.54	 An army officer and those watching Jesus with him saw the earthquake and the other things happening. They were terrified and said, “Certainly, this was the Son of God!”
MAT.27.55	 Many women were there watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee and had always supported him. 
MAT.27.56	 Among them were Mary from Magdala, Mary (the mother of James and Joseph), and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
MAT.27.57	 In the evening a rich man named Joseph arrived. He was from the city of Arimathea and had become a disciple of Jesus. 
MAT.27.58	 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
MAT.27.59	 Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. 
MAT.27.60	 Then he laid it in his own new tomb, which had been cut in a rock. After rolling a large stone against the door of the tomb, he went away. 
MAT.27.61	 Mary from Magdala and the other Mary were sitting there, facing the tomb.
MAT.27.62	 The next day, which was the day of worship, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together and went to Pilate. 
MAT.27.63	 They said, “Sir, we remember how that deceiver said while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will be brought back to life.’ 
MAT.27.64	 Therefore, give the order to make the tomb secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may steal him and say to the people, ‘He has been brought back to life.’ Then the last deception will be worse than the first.”
MAT.27.65	 Pilate told them, “You have the soldiers you want for guard duty. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how.”
MAT.27.66	 So they went to secure the tomb. They placed a seal on the stone and posted the soldiers on guard duty.
MAT.28.1	 After the day of worship, as the sun rose Sunday morning, Mary from Magdala and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
MAT.28.2	 Suddenly, there was a powerful earthquake. An angel of the Lord had come down from heaven, rolled the stone away, and was sitting on it. 
MAT.28.3	 He was as bright as lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow. 
MAT.28.4	 The guards were so deathly afraid of him that they shook.
MAT.28.5	 The angel said to the women, “Don’t be afraid! I know you’re looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 
MAT.28.6	 He’s not here. He has been brought back to life as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying. 
MAT.28.7	 Then go quickly, and tell his disciples that he has been brought back to life. He’s going ahead of them into Galilee. There they will see him. Take note that I have told you.”
MAT.28.8	 They hurried away from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples.
MAT.28.9	 Suddenly, Jesus met them and greeted them. They went up to him, bowed down to worship him, and took hold of his feet.
MAT.28.10	 Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid! Go, tell my followers to go to Galilee. There they will see me.”
MAT.28.11	 While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city. They told the chief priests everything that had happened.
MAT.28.12	 The chief priests gathered together with the leaders and agreed on a plan. They gave the soldiers a large amount of money 
MAT.28.13	 and told them to say that Jesus’ disciples had come at night and had stolen his body while they were sleeping. 
MAT.28.14	 ⌊They added,⌋ “If the governor hears about it, we’ll take care of it, and you’ll have nothing to worry about.”
MAT.28.15	 The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. Their story has been spread among the Jewish people to this day.
MAT.28.16	 The eleven disciples went to the mountain in Galilee where Jesus had told them to go. 
MAT.28.17	 When they saw him, they bowed down in worship, though some had doubts.
MAT.28.18	 When Jesus came near, he spoke to them. He said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
MAT.28.19	 So wherever you go, make disciples of all nations: Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. 
MAT.28.20	 Teach them to do everything I have commanded you.
MAT.28.20	“And remember that I am always with you until the end of time.”
MRK.1.1	 This is the beginning of the Good News about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
MRK.1.2	 The prophet Isaiah wrote,
MRK.1.2	“I am sending my messenger ahead of you
MRK.1.2	to prepare the way for you.”
MRK.1.3	 “A voice cries out in the desert:
MRK.1.3	‘Prepare the way for the Lord!
MRK.1.3	Make his paths straight!’ ”
MRK.1.4	 John the Baptizer was in the desert telling people about a baptism of repentance 
MRK.1.5	 All Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went to him. As they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.
MRK.1.6	 John was dressed in clothes made from camel’s hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.
MRK.1.7	 He announced, “The one who comes after me is more powerful than I. I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandal straps. 
MRK.1.8	 I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
MRK.1.9	 At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River. 
MRK.1.10	 As Jesus came out of the water, he saw heaven split open and the Spirit coming down to him as a dove. 
MRK.1.11	 A voice from heaven said, “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you.”
MRK.1.12	 At once the Spirit brought him into the desert, 
MRK.1.13	 where he was tempted by Satan for 40 days. He was there with the wild animals, and the angels took care of him.
MRK.1.14	 After John had been put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee and told people the Good News of God. 
MRK.1.15	 He said, “The time has come, and the kingdom of God is near. Change the way you think and act, and believe the Good News.”
MRK.1.16	 As he was going along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen. 
MRK.1.17	 Jesus said to them, “Come, follow me! I will teach you how to catch people instead of fish.” 
MRK.1.18	 They immediately left their nets and followed him.
MRK.1.19	 As Jesus went on a little farther, he saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat preparing their nets ⌊to go fishing⌋. 
MRK.1.20	 He immediately called them, and they left their father Zebedee and the hired men in the boat and followed Jesus.
MRK.1.21	 Then they went to Capernaum. On the next day of worship, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. 
MRK.1.22	 The people were amazed at his teachings. Unlike their experts in Moses’ Teachings, he taught them with authority.
MRK.1.23	 At that time there was a man in the synagogue who was controlled by an evil spirit. He shouted, 
MRK.1.24	 “What do you want with us, Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
MRK.1.25	 Jesus ordered the spirit, “Keep quiet, and come out of him!” 
MRK.1.26	 The evil spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out of him with a loud shriek.
MRK.1.27	 Everyone was stunned. They said to each other, “What is this? This is a new teaching that has authority behind it! He gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey him.”
MRK.1.28	 The news about him spread quickly throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.
MRK.1.29	 After they left the synagogue, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew. James and John went with them. 
MRK.1.30	 Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. The first thing they did was to tell Jesus about her. 
MRK.1.31	 Jesus went to her, took her hand, and helped her get up. The fever went away, and she prepared a meal for them.
MRK.1.32	 In the evening, when the sun had set, people brought to him everyone who was sick and those possessed by demons. 
MRK.1.33	 The whole city had gathered at his door. 
MRK.1.34	 He cured many who were sick with various diseases and forced many demons out of people. However, he would not allow the demons to speak. After all, they knew who he was.
MRK.1.35	 In the morning, long before sunrise, Jesus went to a place where he could be alone to pray. 
MRK.1.36	 Simon and his friends searched for him. 
MRK.1.37	 When they found him, they told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”
MRK.1.38	 Jesus said to them, “Let’s go somewhere else, to the small towns that are nearby. I have to spread ⌊the Good News⌋ in them also. This is why I have come.”
MRK.1.39	 So he went to spread ⌊the Good News⌋ in the synagogues all over Galilee, and he forced demons out of people.
MRK.1.40	 Then a man with a serious skin disease came to him. The man fell to his knees and begged Jesus, “If you’re willing, you can make me clean.” 
MRK.1.41	 Jesus felt sorry for him, reached out, touched him, and said, “I’m willing. So be clean!”
MRK.1.42	 Immediately, his skin disease went away, and he was clean.
MRK.1.43	 Jesus sent him away at once and warned him, 
MRK.1.44	 “Don’t tell anyone about this! Instead, show yourself to the priest. Then offer the sacrifices which Moses commanded as proof to people that you are clean.”
MRK.1.45	 When the man left, he began to talk freely. He spread his story so widely that Jesus could no longer enter any city openly. Instead, he stayed in places where he could be alone. But people still kept coming to him from everywhere.
MRK.2.1	 Several days later Jesus came back to Capernaum. The report went out that he was home. 
MRK.2.2	 Many people had gathered. There was no room left, even in front of the door. Jesus was speaking ⌊God’s⌋ word to them.
MRK.2.3	 Four men came to him carrying a paralyzed man. 
MRK.2.4	 Since they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof over the place where Jesus was. Then they lowered the cot on which the paralyzed man was lying.
MRK.2.5	 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”
MRK.2.6	 Some experts in Moses’ Teachings were sitting there. They thought, 
MRK.2.7	 “Why does he talk this way? He’s dishonoring God. Who besides God can forgive sins?”
MRK.2.8	 At once, Jesus knew inwardly what they were thinking. He asked them, “Why do you have these thoughts? 
MRK.2.9	 Is it easier to say to this paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your cot, and walk’? 
MRK.2.10	 I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” Then he said to the paralyzed man, 
MRK.2.11	 “I’m telling you to get up, pick up your cot, and go home!”
MRK.2.12	 The man got up, immediately picked up his cot, and walked away while everyone watched. Everyone was amazed and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this.”
MRK.2.13	 Jesus went to the seashore again. Large crowds came to him, and he taught them.
MRK.2.14	 When Jesus was leaving, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting in a tax office. Jesus said to him, “Follow me!” So Levi got up and followed him.
MRK.2.15	 Later Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house. Many tax collectors and sinners who were followers of Jesus were eating with him and his disciples. 
MRK.2.16	 When the experts in Moses’ Teachings who were Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
MRK.2.17	 When Jesus heard that, he said to them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor; those who are sick do. I’ve come to call sinners, not people who think they have God’s approval.”
MRK.2.18	 John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, “Why do John’s disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples don’t?”
MRK.2.19	 Jesus replied, “Can wedding guests fast while the groom is still with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast. 
MRK.2.20	 But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.
MRK.2.21	 “No one patches an old coat with a new piece of cloth that will shrink. Otherwise, the new patch will shrink and rip away some of the old cloth, and the tear will become worse. 
MRK.2.22	 People don’t pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will make the skins burst, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Rather, new wine is to be poured into fresh skins.”
MRK.2.23	 Once on a day of worship Jesus was going through the grainfields. As the disciples walked along, they began to pick the heads of grain.
MRK.2.24	 The Pharisees asked him, “Look! Why are your disciples doing something that is not permitted on the day of worship?”
MRK.2.25	 Jesus asked them, “Haven’t you ever read what David did when he and his men were in need and were hungry? 
MRK.2.26	 Haven’t you ever read how he went into the house of God when Abiathar was chief priest and ate the bread of the presence? He had no right to eat those loaves. Only the priests have that right. Haven’t you ever read how he also gave some of it to his men?”
MRK.2.27	 Then he added, “The day of worship was made for people, not people for the day of worship. 
MRK.2.28	 For this reason the Son of Man has authority over the day of worship.”
MRK.3.1	 Jesus went into a synagogue again. A man who had a paralyzed hand was there. 
MRK.3.2	 The people were watching Jesus closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the day of worship so that they could accuse him of doing something wrong.
MRK.3.3	 So he told the man with the paralyzed hand, “Stand in the center ⌊of the synagogue⌋.” 
MRK.3.4	 Then he asked them, “Is it right to do good or to do evil on the day of worship, to give a person back his health or to let him die?”
MRK.3.4	But they were silent. 
MRK.3.5	 Jesus was angry as he looked around at them. He was deeply hurt because their minds were closed. Then he told the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man held it out, and his hand became normal again.
MRK.3.6	 The Pharisees left, and with Herod’s followers they immediately plotted to kill Jesus.
MRK.3.7	 Jesus left with his disciples for the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd from Galilee, Judea, 
MRK.3.8	 Jerusalem, Idumea, and from across the Jordan River, and from around Tyre and Sidon followed him. They came to him because they had heard about everything he was doing. 
MRK.3.9	 Jesus told his disciples to have a boat ready so that the crowd would not crush him. 
MRK.3.10	 He had cured so many that everyone with a disease rushed up to him in order to touch him. 
MRK.3.11	 Whenever people with evil spirits saw him, they would fall down in front of him and shout, “You are the Son of God!” 
MRK.3.12	 He gave them orders not to tell people who he was.
MRK.3.13	 Jesus went up a mountain, called those whom he wanted, and they came to him. 
MRK.3.14	 He appointed twelve whom he called apostles.
MRK.3.15	 They also had the authority to force demons out of people.
MRK.3.16	 He appointed these twelve: Simon (whom Jesus named Peter), 
MRK.3.17	 James and his brother John (Zebedee’s sons whom Jesus named Boanerges, which means “Thunderbolts”), 
MRK.3.18	 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, 
MRK.3.19	 and Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed Jesus).
MRK.3.20	 Then Jesus went home. Another crowd gathered so that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat. 
MRK.3.21	 When his family heard about it, they went to get him. They said, “He’s out of his mind!”
MRK.3.22	 The experts in Moses’ Teachings who had come from Jerusalem said, “Beelzebul is in him,” and “He forces demons out of people with the help of the ruler of demons.”
MRK.3.23	 Jesus called them together and used this illustration: “How can Satan force out Satan? 
MRK.3.24	 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot last. 
MRK.3.25	 And if a household is divided against itself, that household will not last. 
MRK.3.26	 So if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he cannot last. That will be the end of him.
MRK.3.27	 “No one can go into a strong man’s house and steal his property. First he must tie up the strong man. Then he can go through the strong man’s house and steal his property.
MRK.3.28	 “I can guarantee this truth: People will be forgiven for any sin or curse. 
MRK.3.29	 But whoever curses the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. He is guilty of an everlasting sin.” 
MRK.3.30	 Jesus said this because the experts in Moses’ Teachings had said that he had an evil spirit.
MRK.3.31	 Then his mother and his brothers arrived. They stood outside and sent someone to ask him to come out. 
MRK.3.32	 The crowd sitting around Jesus told him, “Your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.”
MRK.3.33	 He replied to them, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?” 
MRK.3.34	 Then looking at those who sat in a circle around him, he said, “Look, here are my mother and my brothers. 
MRK.3.35	 Whoever does what God wants is my brother and sister and mother.”
MRK.4.1	 Jesus began to teach again by the Sea of Galilee. A very large crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat in it. The boat was in the water while the entire crowd lined the shore. 
MRK.4.2	 He used stories as illustrations to teach them many things.
MRK.4.2	While he was teaching them, he said, 
MRK.4.3	 “Listen! A farmer went to plant seed. 
MRK.4.4	 Some seeds were planted along the road, and birds came and devoured them. 
MRK.4.5	 Other seeds were planted on rocky ground, where there wasn’t much soil. The plants sprouted quickly because the soil wasn’t deep. 
MRK.4.6	 When the sun came up, they were scorched. They didn’t have any roots, so they withered. 
MRK.4.7	 Other seeds were planted among thornbushes. The thornbushes grew up and choked them, and they didn’t produce anything. 
MRK.4.8	 But other seeds were planted on good ground, sprouted, and produced thirty, sixty, or one hundred times as much as was planted.” 
MRK.4.9	 He added, “Let the person who has ears listen!”
MRK.4.10	 When he was alone with his followers and the twelve apostles, they asked him about the stories.
MRK.4.11	 Jesus replied to them, “The mystery about the kingdom of God has been given ⌊directly⌋ to you. To those on the outside, it is given in stories:
MRK.4.12	 ‘They see clearly but don’t perceive.
MRK.4.12	They hear clearly but don’t understand.
MRK.4.12	They never return to me
MRK.4.12	and are never forgiven.’ ”
MRK.4.13	 Jesus asked them, “Don’t you understand this story? How, then, will you understand any of the stories I use as illustrations?
MRK.4.14	 “The farmer plants the word. 
MRK.4.15	 Some people are like seeds that were planted along the road. Whenever they hear the word, Satan comes at once and takes away the word that was planted in them. 
MRK.4.16	 Other people are like seeds that were planted on rocky ground. Whenever they hear the word, they accept it at once with joy. 
MRK.4.17	 But they don’t develop any roots. They last for a short time. When suffering or persecution comes along because of the word, they immediately fall ⌊from faith⌋. 
MRK.4.18	 Other people are like seeds planted among thornbushes. They hear the word, 
MRK.4.19	 but the worries of life, the deceitful pleasures of riches, and the desires for other things take over. They choke the word so that it can’t produce anything. 
MRK.4.20	 Others are like seeds planted on good ground. They hear the word, accept it, and produce crops—thirty, sixty, or one hundred times as much as was planted.”
MRK.4.21	 Jesus said to them, “Does anyone bring a lamp into a room to put it under a basket or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a lamp stand? 
MRK.4.22	 There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. There is nothing kept secret that will not come to light. 
MRK.4.23	 Let the person who has ears listen!”
MRK.4.24	 He went on to say, “Pay attention to what you’re listening to! ⌊Knowledge⌋ will be measured out to you by the measure ⌊of attention⌋ you give. This is the way knowledge increases. 
MRK.4.25	 Those who understand ⌊these mysteries⌋ will be given ⌊more knowledge⌋. However, some people don’t understand ⌊these mysteries⌋. Even what they understand will be taken away from them.”
MRK.4.26	 Jesus said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seeds on the ground. 
MRK.4.27	 He sleeps at night and is awake during the day. The seeds sprout and grow, although the man doesn’t know how. 
MRK.4.28	 The ground produces grain by itself. First the green blade appears, then the head, then the head full of grain. 
MRK.4.29	 As soon as the grain is ready, he cuts it with a sickle, because harvest time has come.”
MRK.4.30	 Jesus asked, “How can we show what the kingdom of God is like? To what can we compare it? 
MRK.4.31	 It’s like a mustard seed planted in the ground. The mustard seed is one of the smallest seeds on earth. 
MRK.4.32	 However, when planted, it comes up and becomes taller than all the garden plants. It grows such large branches that birds can nest in its shade.”
MRK.4.33	 Jesus spoke ⌊God’s⌋ word to them using many illustrations like these. In this way people could understand what he taught. 
MRK.4.34	 He did not speak to them without using an illustration. But when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them.
MRK.4.35	 That evening, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s cross to the other side.”
MRK.4.36	 Leaving the crowd, they took Jesus along in a boat just as he was. Other boats were with him.
MRK.4.37	 A violent windstorm came up. The waves were breaking into the boat so that it was quickly filling up. 
MRK.4.38	 But he was sleeping on a cushion in the back of the boat.
MRK.4.38	So they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re going to die?”
MRK.4.39	 Then he got up, ordered the wind to stop, and said to the sea, “Be still, absolutely still!” The wind stopped blowing, and the sea became very calm.
MRK.4.40	 He asked them, “Why are you such cowards? Don’t you have any faith yet?”
MRK.4.41	 They were overcome with fear and asked each other, “Who is this man? Even the wind and the sea obey him!”
MRK.5.1	 They arrived in the territory of the Gerasenes on the other side of the Sea of Galilee. 
MRK.5.2	 As Jesus stepped out of the boat, a man came out of the tombs and met him. The man was controlled by an evil spirit 
MRK.5.3	 and lived among the tombs. No one could restrain him any longer, not even with a chain. 
MRK.5.4	 He had often been chained hand and foot. However, he snapped the chains off his hands and broke the chains from his feet. No one could control him. 
MRK.5.5	 Night and day he was among the tombs and on the mountainsides screaming and cutting himself with stones.
MRK.5.6	 The man saw Jesus at a distance. So he ran ⌊to Jesus⌋, bowed down in front of him, 
MRK.5.7	 and shouted, “Why are you bothering me now, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won’t torture me.” 
MRK.5.8	 He shouted this because Jesus said, “You evil spirit, come out of the man.”
MRK.5.9	 Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”
MRK.5.9	He told Jesus, “My name is Legion [Six Thousand], because there are many of us.” 
MRK.5.10	 He begged Jesus not to send them out of the territory.
MRK.5.11	 A large herd of pigs was feeding on a mountainside nearby. 
MRK.5.12	 The demons begged him, “Send us into the pigs! Let us enter them!”
MRK.5.13	 Jesus let them do this. The evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned.
MRK.5.14	 Those who took care of the pigs ran away. In the city and countryside they reported everything that had happened. So the people came to see what had happened. 
MRK.5.15	 They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons. The man was sitting there dressed and in his right mind. The people were frightened. 
MRK.5.16	 Those who saw this told what had happened to the demon-possessed man and the pigs. 
MRK.5.17	 Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their territory.
MRK.5.18	 As Jesus stepped into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged him, “Let me stay with you.” 
MRK.5.19	 But Jesus would not allow it. Instead, he told the man, “Go home to your family, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been to you.”
MRK.5.20	 So the man left. He began to tell how much Jesus had done for him in the Ten Cities.
MRK.5.21	 Jesus again crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee in a boat. A large crowd gathered around him by the seashore.
MRK.5.22	 A synagogue leader named Jairus also arrived. When he saw Jesus, he quickly bowed down in front of him. 
MRK.5.23	 He begged Jesus, “My little daughter is dying. Come, lay your hands on her so that she may get well and live.”
MRK.5.24	 Jesus went with the man. A huge crowd followed Jesus and pressed him on every side.
MRK.5.25	 In the crowd was a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years. 
MRK.5.26	 Although she had been under the care of many doctors and had spent all her money, she had not been helped at all. Actually, she had become worse. 
MRK.5.27	 Since she had heard about Jesus, she came from behind in the crowd and touched his clothes. 
MRK.5.28	 She said, “If I can just touch his clothes, I’ll get well.” 
MRK.5.29	 Her bleeding stopped immediately. She felt cured from her illness.
MRK.5.30	 At that moment Jesus felt power had gone out of him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”
MRK.5.31	 His disciples said to him, “How can you ask, ‘Who touched me,’ when you see the crowd pressing you on all sides?”
MRK.5.32	 But he kept looking around to see the woman who had done this. 
MRK.5.33	 The woman trembled with fear. She knew what had happened to her. So she quickly bowed in front of him and told him the whole truth.
MRK.5.34	 Jesus told her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace! Be cured from your illness.”
MRK.5.35	 While Jesus was still speaking to her, some people came from the synagogue leader’s home. They told the synagogue leader, “Your daughter has died. Why bother the teacher anymore?”
MRK.5.36	 When Jesus overheard what they said, he told the synagogue leader, “Don’t be afraid! Just believe.”
MRK.5.37	 Jesus allowed no one to go with him except Peter and the two brothers James and John. 
MRK.5.38	 When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a noisy crowd there. People were crying and sobbing loudly. 
MRK.5.39	 When he came into the house, he asked them, “Why are you making so much noise and crying? The child isn’t dead. She’s just sleeping.”
MRK.5.40	 They laughed at him. So he made all of them go outside. Then he took the child’s father, mother, and his three disciples and went to the child. 
MRK.5.41	 Jesus took the child’s hand and said to her, “Talitha, koum!” which means, “Little girl, I’m telling you to get up!”
MRK.5.42	 The girl got up at once and started to walk. (She was twelve years old.) They were astonished.
MRK.5.43	 Jesus ordered them not to let anyone know about this. He also told them to give the little girl something to eat.
MRK.6.1	 Jesus left that place and went to his hometown. His disciples followed him. 
MRK.6.2	 When the day of worship came, he began to teach in the synagogue. He amazed many who heard him. They asked, “Where did this man get these ideas? Who gave him this kind of wisdom and the ability to do such great miracles? 
MRK.6.3	 Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” So they took offense at him.
MRK.6.4	 But Jesus told them, “The only place a prophet isn’t honored is in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own house.” 
MRK.6.5	 He couldn’t work any miracles there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and cure them. 
MRK.6.6	 Their unbelief amazed him.
MRK.6.6	Then Jesus went around to the villages and taught.
MRK.6.7	 He called the twelve apostles, sent them out two by two, and gave them authority over evil spirits. 
MRK.6.8	 He instructed them to take nothing along on the trip except a walking stick. They were not to take any food, a traveling bag, or money in their pockets. 
MRK.6.9	 They could wear sandals but could not take along a change of clothes.
MRK.6.10	 He told them, “Whenever you go into a home, stay there until you’re ready to leave that place. 
MRK.6.11	 Wherever people don’t welcome you or listen to you, leave and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them.”
MRK.6.12	 So the apostles went and told people that they should turn to God and change the way they think and act. 
MRK.6.13	 They also forced many demons out of people and poured oil on many who were sick to cure them.
MRK.6.14	 King Herod heard about Jesus, because Jesus’ name had become well-known. Some people were saying, “John the Baptizer has come back to life. That’s why he has the power to perform these miracles.” 
MRK.6.15	 Others said, “He is Elijah.” Still others said, “He is a prophet like one of the other prophets.” 
MRK.6.16	 But when Herod heard about it, he said, “I had John’s head cut off, and he has come back to life!”
MRK.6.17	 Herod had sent men who had arrested John, tied him up, and put him in prison. Herod did that for Herodias, whom he had married. (She used to be his brother Philip’s wife.) 
MRK.6.18	 John had been telling Herod, “It’s not right for you to be married to your brother’s wife.”
MRK.6.19	 So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she wasn’t allowed to do it 
MRK.6.20	 because Herod was afraid of John. Herod knew that John was a fair and holy man, so he protected him. When he listened to John, he would become very disturbed, and yet he liked to listen to him.
MRK.6.21	 An opportunity finally came on Herod’s birthday. Herod gave a dinner for his top officials, army officers, and the most important people of Galilee. 
MRK.6.22	 His daughter, that is, Herodias’ daughter, came in and danced. Herod and his guests were delighted with her. The king told the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I’ll give it to you.” 
MRK.6.23	 He swore an oath to her: “I’ll give you anything you ask for, up to half of my kingdom.”
MRK.6.24	 So she went out and asked her mother, “What should I ask for?”
MRK.6.24	Her mother said, “Ask for the head of John the Baptizer.”
MRK.6.25	 So the girl hurried back to the king with her request. She said, “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptizer on a platter at once.”
MRK.6.26	 The king deeply regretted his promise. But because of his oath and his guests, he didn’t want to refuse her. 
MRK.6.27	 Immediately, the king sent a guard and ordered him to bring John’s head. The guard cut off John’s head in prison. 
MRK.6.28	 Then he brought the head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
MRK.6.29	 When John’s disciples heard about this, they came for his body and laid it in a tomb.
MRK.6.30	 The apostles gathered around Jesus. They reported to him everything they had done and taught. 
MRK.6.31	 So he said to them, “Let’s go to a place where we can be alone to rest for a while.” Many people were coming and going, and Jesus and the apostles didn’t even have a chance to eat.
MRK.6.32	 So they went away in a boat to a place where they could be alone. 
MRK.6.33	 But many people saw them leave and recognized them. The people ran from all the cities and arrived ahead of them. 
MRK.6.34	 When Jesus got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd and felt sorry for them. They were like sheep without a shepherd. So he spent a lot of time teaching them.
MRK.6.35	 When it was late, his disciples came to him. They said, “No one lives around here, and it’s already late. 
MRK.6.36	 Send the people to the closest farms and villages to buy themselves something to eat.”
MRK.6.37	 Jesus replied, “You give them something to eat.”
MRK.6.37	They said to him, “Should we go and spend about a year’s wages on bread to feed them?”
MRK.6.38	 He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.”
MRK.6.38	When they found out, they told him, “Five loaves of bread and two fish.”
MRK.6.39	 Then he ordered all of them to sit down in groups on the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	 They sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
MRK.6.41	 After he took the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed the food. He broke the loaves apart and kept giving them to the disciples to give to the people. He also gave pieces of the two fish to everyone. 
MRK.6.42	 All of them ate as much as they wanted. 
MRK.6.43	 When they picked up the leftover pieces, they filled twelve baskets with bread and fish. 
MRK.6.44	 There were 5,000 men who had eaten the bread.
MRK.6.45	 Jesus quickly made his disciples get into a boat and cross to Bethsaida ahead of him while he sent the people away. 
MRK.6.46	 After saying goodbye to them, he went up a mountain to pray. 
MRK.6.47	 When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land.
MRK.6.48	 Jesus saw that they were in a lot of trouble as they rowed, because they were going against the wind. Between three and six o’clock in the morning, he came to them. He was walking on the sea. He wanted to pass by them. 
MRK.6.49	 When they saw him walking on the sea, they thought, “It’s a ghost!” and they began to scream. 
MRK.6.50	 All of them saw him and were terrified.
MRK.6.50	Immediately, he said, “Calm down! It’s me. Don’t be afraid!” 
MRK.6.51	 He got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped blowing. The disciples were astounded. 
MRK.6.52	 (They didn’t understand what had happened with the loaves of bread. Instead, their minds were closed.)
MRK.6.53	 They crossed the sea, came to shore at Gennesaret, and anchored there.
MRK.6.54	 As soon as they stepped out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus. 
MRK.6.55	 They ran all over the countryside and began to carry the sick on cots to any place where they heard he was. 
MRK.6.56	 Whenever he would go into villages, cities, or farms, people would put their sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch the edge of his clothes. Everyone who touched his clothes was made well.
MRK.7.1	 The Pharisees and some experts in Moses’ Teachings who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus. 
MRK.7.2	 They saw that some of his disciples were unclean 
MRK.7.3	 (The Pharisees, like all other Jewish people, don’t eat unless they have properly washed their hands. They follow the traditions of their ancestors. 
MRK.7.4	 When they come from the marketplace, they don’t eat unless they have washed first. They have been taught to follow many other rules. For example, they must also wash their cups, jars, brass pots, and dinner tables.
MRK.7.5	 The Pharisees and the experts in Moses’ Teachings asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples follow the traditions taught by our ancestors? They are unclean because they don’t wash their hands before they eat!”
MRK.7.6	 Jesus told them, “Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites in Scripture:
MRK.7.6	‘These people honor me with their lips,
MRK.7.6	but their hearts are far from me.
MRK.7.7	 Their worship of me is pointless,
MRK.7.7	because their teachings are rules made by humans.’
MRK.7.8	 “You abandon the commandments of God to follow human traditions.” 
MRK.7.9	 He added, “You have no trouble rejecting the commandments of God in order to keep your own traditions! 
MRK.7.10	 For example, Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’ and ‘Whoever curses father or mother must be put to death.’ 
MRK.7.11	 But you say, ‘If a person tells his father or mother that whatever he might have used to help them is 
MRK.7.12	 he no longer has to do anything for his father or mother.’ 
MRK.7.13	 Because of your traditions you have destroyed the authority of God’s word. And you do many other things like that.”
MRK.7.14	 Then he called the crowd again and said to them, “Listen to me, all of you, and try to understand! 
MRK.7.15	 Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean. It’s what comes out of a person that makes him unclean. 
MRK.7.16	 Let the person who has ears listen!” 
MRK.7.17	 When he had left the people and gone home, his disciples asked him about this illustration.
MRK.7.18	 Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand? Don’t you know that whatever goes into a person from the outside can’t make him unclean? 
MRK.7.19	 It doesn’t go into his thoughts but into his stomach and then into a toilet.” (By saying this, Jesus declared all foods acceptable.) 
MRK.7.20	 He continued, “It’s what comes out of a person that makes him unclean. 
MRK.7.21	 Evil thoughts, sexual sins, stealing, murder, 
MRK.7.22	 adultery, greed, wickedness, cheating, shameless lust, envy, cursing, arrogance, and foolishness come from within a person. 
MRK.7.23	 All these evils come from within and make a person unclean.”
MRK.7.24	 Jesus left that place and went to the territory of Tyre. He didn’t want anyone to know that he was staying in a house there. However, it couldn’t be kept a secret.
MRK.7.25	 A woman whose little daughter had an evil spirit heard about Jesus. She went to him and bowed down. 
MRK.7.26	 The woman happened to be Greek, born in Phoenicia in Syria. She asked him to force the demon out of her daughter.
MRK.7.27	 Jesus said to her, “First, let the children eat all they want. It’s not right to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.”
MRK.7.28	 She answered him, “Lord, even the dogs under the table eat some of the children’s scraps.”
MRK.7.29	 Jesus said to her, “Because you have said this, go! The demon has left your daughter.”
MRK.7.30	 The woman went home and found the little child lying on her bed, and the demon was gone.
MRK.7.31	 Jesus then left the neighborhood of Tyre. He went through Sidon and the territory of the Ten Cities 
MRK.7.32	 Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and who also had a speech defect. They begged Jesus to lay his hand on him. 
MRK.7.33	 Jesus took him away from the crowd to be alone with him. He put his fingers into the man’s ears, and after spitting, he touched the man’s tongue. 
MRK.7.34	 Then he looked up to heaven, sighed, and said to the man, “Ephphatha!” which means, “Be opened!” 
MRK.7.35	 At once the man could hear and talk normally.
MRK.7.36	 Jesus ordered the people not to tell anyone. But the more he ordered them, the more they spread the news. 
MRK.7.37	 Jesus completely amazed the people. They said, “He has done everything well. He makes the deaf hear and the mute talk.”
MRK.8.1	 About that time there was once again a large crowd with nothing to eat. Jesus called his disciples and said to them, 
MRK.8.2	 “I feel sorry for the people. They have been with me three days now and have nothing to eat. 
MRK.8.3	 If I send them home before they’ve eaten, they will become exhausted on the road. Some of them have come a long distance.”
MRK.8.4	 His disciples asked him, “Where could anyone get enough bread to feed these people in this place where no one lives?”
MRK.8.5	 Jesus asked them, “How many loaves of bread do you have?”
MRK.8.5	They answered, “Seven.”
MRK.8.6	 He ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground. He took the seven loaves and gave thanks to God. Then he broke the bread and gave it to his disciples to serve to the people. 
MRK.8.7	 They also had a few small fish. He blessed them and said that the fish should also be served to the people. 
MRK.8.8	 The people ate as much as they wanted. The disciples picked up the leftover pieces and filled seven large baskets. 
MRK.8.9	 About four thousand people were there. Then he sent the people on their way.
MRK.8.10	 After that, Jesus and his disciples got into a boat and went into the region of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	 The Pharisees went to Jesus and began to argue with him. They tested him by demanding that he perform a miraculous sign from heaven.
MRK.8.12	 With a deep sigh he asked, “Why do these people demand a sign? I can guarantee this truth: If these people are given a sign, it will be far different than what they want!”
MRK.8.13	 Then he left them there.
MRK.8.13	He got into a boat again and crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. 
MRK.8.14	 The disciples had forgotten to take any bread along and had only one loaf with them in the boat.
MRK.8.15	 Jesus warned them, “Be careful! Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!”
MRK.8.16	 They had been discussing with one another that they didn’t have any bread.
MRK.8.17	 Jesus knew what they were saying and asked them, “Why are you discussing the fact that you don’t have any bread? Don’t you understand yet? Don’t you catch on? Are your minds closed? 
MRK.8.18	 Are you blind and deaf? Don’t you remember? 
MRK.8.19	 When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces?”
MRK.8.19	They told him, “Twelve.”
MRK.8.20	 “When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many large baskets did you fill with leftover pieces?”
MRK.8.20	They answered him, “Seven.”
MRK.8.21	 He asked them, “Don’t you catch on yet?”
MRK.8.22	 As they came to Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus. They begged Jesus to touch him. 
MRK.8.23	 Jesus took the blind man’s hand and led him out of the village. He spit into the man’s eyes and placed his hands on him. Jesus asked him, “Can you see anything?”
MRK.8.24	 The man looked up and said, “I see people. They look like trees walking around.”
MRK.8.25	 Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes a second time, and the man saw clearly. His sight was normal again. He could see everything clearly even at a distance. 
MRK.8.26	 Jesus told him when he sent him home, “Don’t go into the village.”
MRK.8.27	 Then Jesus and his disciples went to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say I am?”
MRK.8.28	 They answered him, “Some say you are John the Baptizer, others Elijah, still others one of the prophets.”
MRK.8.29	 He asked them, “But who do you say I am?”
MRK.8.29	Peter answered him, “You are the Messiah!”
MRK.8.30	 He ordered them not to tell anyone about him.
MRK.8.31	 Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man would have to suffer a lot. He taught them that he would be rejected by the leaders, the chief priests, and the experts in Moses’ Teachings. He would be killed, but after three days he would come back to life. 
MRK.8.32	 He told them very clearly what he meant.
MRK.8.32	Peter took him aside and objected to this. 
MRK.8.33	 Jesus turned, looked at his disciples, and objected to what Peter said. Jesus said, “Get out of my way, Satan! You aren’t thinking the way God thinks but the way humans think.”
MRK.8.34	 Then Jesus called the crowd to himself along with his disciples. He said to them, “Those who want to follow me must say no to the things they want, pick up their crosses, and follow me. 
MRK.8.35	 Those who want to save their lives will lose them. But those who lose their lives for me and for the Good News will save them. 
MRK.8.36	 What good does it do for people to win the whole world yet lose their lives? 
MRK.8.37	 Or what should a person give in exchange for life? 
MRK.8.38	 If people are ashamed of me and what I say in this unfaithful and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of those people when he comes with the holy angels in his Father’s glory.”
MRK.9.1	 He said to them, “I can guarantee this truth: Some people who are standing here will not die until they see the kingdom of God arrive with power.”
MRK.9.2	 After six days Jesus took only Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain where they could be alone.
MRK.9.2	Jesus’ appearance changed in front of them. 
MRK.9.3	 His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them. 
MRK.9.4	 Then Elijah and Moses appeared to them and were talking with Jesus.
MRK.9.5	 Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it’s good that we’re here. Let’s put up three tents—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 
MRK.9.6	 (Peter didn’t know how to respond. He and the others were terrified.)
MRK.9.7	 Then a cloud overshadowed them. A voice came out of the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!”
MRK.9.8	 Suddenly, as they looked around, they saw no one with them but Jesus.
MRK.9.9	 On their way down the mountain, Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen. They were to wait until the Son of Man had come back to life. 
MRK.9.10	 They kept in mind what he said but argued among themselves what he meant by “come back to life.” 
MRK.9.11	 So they asked him, “Don’t the experts in Moses’ Teachings say that Elijah must come first?”
MRK.9.12	 Jesus said to them, “Elijah is coming first and will put everything in order again. But in what sense was it written that the Son of Man must suffer a lot and be treated shamefully? 
MRK.9.13	 Indeed, I can guarantee that Elijah has come. Yet, people treated him as they pleased, as Scripture says about him.”
MRK.9.14	 When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them. Some experts in Moses’ Teachings were arguing with them. 
MRK.9.15	 All the people were very surprised to see Jesus and ran to welcome him.
MRK.9.16	 Jesus asked the experts in Moses’ Teachings, “What are you arguing about with them?”
MRK.9.17	 A man in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought you my son. He is possessed by a spirit that won’t let him talk. 
MRK.9.18	 Whenever the spirit brings on a seizure, it throws him to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes exhausted. I asked your disciples to force the spirit out, but they didn’t have the power to do it.”
MRK.9.19	 Jesus said to them, “You unbelieving generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me!”
MRK.9.20	 They brought the boy to him. As soon as the spirit saw Jesus, it threw the boy into convulsions. He fell on the ground, rolled around, and foamed at the mouth.
MRK.9.21	 Jesus asked his father, “How long has he been like this?”
MRK.9.21	The father replied, “He has been this way since he was a child. 
MRK.9.22	 The demon has often thrown him into fire or into water to destroy him. If it’s possible for you, put yourself in our place, and help us!”
MRK.9.23	 Jesus said to him, “As far as possibilities go, everything is possible for the person who believes.”
MRK.9.24	 The child’s father cried out at once, “I believe! Help my lack of faith.”
MRK.9.25	 When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he gave an order to the evil spirit. He said, “You spirit that won’t let him talk, I command you to come out of him and never enter him again.”
MRK.9.26	 The evil spirit screamed, shook the child violently, and came out. The boy looked as if he were dead, and everyone said, “He’s dead!”
MRK.9.27	 Jesus took his hand and helped him to stand up.
MRK.9.28	 When Jesus went into a house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we force the spirit out of the boy?”
MRK.9.29	 He told them, “This kind of spirit can be forced out only by prayer.” 
MRK.9.30	 They left that place and were passing through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where he was 
MRK.9.31	 because he was teaching his disciples. He taught them, “The Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to people. They will kill him, but on the third day he will come back to life.”
MRK.9.32	 The disciples didn’t understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him.
MRK.9.33	 Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus was at home, he asked the disciples, “What were you arguing about on the road?” 
MRK.9.34	 They were silent. On the road they had argued about who was the greatest.
MRK.9.35	 He sat down and called the twelve apostles. He told them, “Whoever wants to be the most important person must take the last place and be a servant to everyone else.” 
MRK.9.36	 Then he took a little child and had him stand among them. He put his arms around the child and said to them, 
MRK.9.37	 “Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me. Whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me.”
MRK.9.38	 John said to Jesus, “Teacher, we saw someone forcing demons out of a person by using the power and authority of your name. We tried to stop him because he was not one of us.”
MRK.9.39	 Jesus said, “Don’t stop him! No one who works a miracle in my name can turn around and speak evil of me. 
MRK.9.40	 Whoever isn’t against us is for us. 
MRK.9.41	 I can guarantee this truth: Whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward.”
MRK.9.42	 “These little ones believe in me. It would be best for the person who causes one of them to lose faith to be thrown into the sea with a large stone hung around his neck.
MRK.9.43	 “So if your hand causes you to lose your faith, cut it off! It is better for you to enter life disabled than to have two hands and go to hell, to the fire that cannot be put out.
MRK.9.45	 If your foot causes you to lose your faith, cut it off! It is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. 
MRK.9.47	 If your eye causes you to lose your faith, tear it out! It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell. 
MRK.9.48	 In hell worms that eat the body never die, and the fire is never put out. 
MRK.9.49	 Everyone will be salted with fire. 
MRK.9.50	 Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste, how will you restore its flavor? Have salt within you, and live in peace with one another.”
MRK.10.1	 Jesus left there and went into the territory of Judea along the other side of the Jordan River. Crowds gathered around him again, and he taught them as he usually did.
MRK.10.2	 Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, “Can a husband divorce his wife?”
MRK.10.3	 Jesus answered them, “What command did Moses give you?”
MRK.10.4	 They said, “Moses allowed a man to give his wife a written notice to divorce her.”
MRK.10.5	 Jesus said to them, “He wrote this command for you because you’re heartless. 
MRK.10.6	 But God made them male and female in the beginning, at creation. 
MRK.10.7	 That’s why a man will leave his father and mother and will remain united with his wife, 
MRK.10.8	 and the two will be one. So they are no longer two but one. 
MRK.10.9	 Therefore, don’t let anyone separate what God has joined together.”
MRK.10.10	 When they were in a house, the disciples asked him about this. 
MRK.10.11	 He answered them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery. 
MRK.10.12	 If a wife divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery.”
MRK.10.13	 Some people brought little children to Jesus to have him hold them. But the disciples told the people not to do that.
MRK.10.14	 When Jesus saw this, he became irritated. He told them, “Don’t stop the children from coming to me. Children like these are part of the kingdom of God. 
MRK.10.15	 I can guarantee this truth: Whoever doesn’t receive the kingdom of God as a little child receives it will never enter it.”
MRK.10.16	 Jesus put his arms around the children and blessed them by placing his hands on them.
MRK.10.17	 As Jesus was coming out to the road, a man came running to him and knelt in front of him. He asked Jesus, “Good Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?”
MRK.10.18	 Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 
MRK.10.19	 You know the commandments: Never murder. Never commit adultery. Never steal. Never give false testimony. Never cheat. Honor your father and mother.”
MRK.10.20	 The man replied, “Teacher, I’ve obeyed all these commandments since I was a boy.”
MRK.10.21	 Jesus looked at him and loved him. He told him, “You’re still missing one thing. Sell everything you have. Give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then follow me!”
MRK.10.22	 When the man heard that, he looked unhappy and went away sad, because he owned a lot of property.
MRK.10.23	 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it will be for rich people to enter the kingdom of God!”
MRK.10.24	 The disciples were stunned by his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! 
MRK.10.25	 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”
MRK.10.26	 This amazed his disciples more than ever. They asked each other, “Who, then, can be saved?”
MRK.10.27	 Jesus looked at them and said, “It’s impossible for people ⌊to save themselves⌋, but it’s not impossible for God to save them. Everything is possible for God.”
MRK.10.28	 Then Peter spoke up, “We’ve given up everything to follow you.”
MRK.10.29	 Jesus said, “I can guarantee this truth: Anyone who gave up his home, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, or fields because of me and the Good News 
MRK.10.30	 will certainly receive a hundred times as much here in this life. They will certainly receive homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields, along with persecutions. But in the world to come they will receive eternal life. 
MRK.10.31	 But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”
MRK.10.32	 Jesus and his disciples were on their way to Jerusalem. Jesus was walking ahead of them. His disciples were shocked ⌊that he was going to Jerusalem⌋. The others who followed were afraid. Once again he took the twelve apostles aside. He began to tell them what was going to happen to him. 
MRK.10.33	 “We’re going to Jerusalem. There the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to foreigners. 
MRK.10.34	 They will make fun of him, spit on him, whip him, and kill him. But after three days he will come back to life.”
MRK.10.35	 James and John, sons of Zebedee, went to Jesus. They said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do us a favor.”
MRK.10.36	 “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked them.
MRK.10.37	 They said to him, “Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.”
MRK.10.38	 Jesus said, “You don’t realize what you’re asking. Can you drink the cup that I’m going to drink? Can you be baptized with the baptism that I’m going to receive?”
MRK.10.39	 “We can,” they told him.
MRK.10.39	Jesus told them, “You will drink the cup that I’m going to drink. You will be baptized with the baptism that I’m going to receive. 
MRK.10.40	 But I don’t have the authority to grant you a seat at my right or left. Those positions have already been prepared for certain people.”
MRK.10.41	 When the other ten apostles heard about it, they were irritated with James and John. 
MRK.10.42	 Jesus called the apostles and said, “You know that the acknowledged rulers of nations have absolute power over people and their officials have absolute authority over people. 
MRK.10.43	 But that’s not the way it’s going to be among you. Whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant. 
MRK.10.44	 Whoever wants to be most important among you will be a slave for everyone. 
MRK.10.45	 It’s the same way with the Son of Man. He didn’t come so that others could serve him. He came to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people.”
MRK.10.46	 Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus, his disciples, and many people were leaving Jericho, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road. 
MRK.10.47	 When he heard that Jesus from Nazareth ⌊was passing by⌋, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
MRK.10.48	 The people told him to be quiet. But he shouted even louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
MRK.10.49	 Jesus stopped and said, “Call him!” They called the blind man and told him, “Cheer up! Get up! He’s calling you.” 
MRK.10.50	 The blind man threw off his coat, jumped up, and went to Jesus.
MRK.10.51	 Jesus asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?”
MRK.10.51	The blind man said, “Teacher, I want to see again.”
MRK.10.52	 Jesus told him, “Go, your faith has made you well.”
MRK.10.52	At once he could see again, and he followed Jesus on the road.
MRK.11.1	 When they came near Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead of him. 
MRK.11.2	 He said to them, “Go into the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a young donkey tied there. No one has ever sat on it. Untie it, and bring it. 
MRK.11.3	 If anyone asks you what you are doing, say that the Lord needs it. That person will send it here at once.”
MRK.11.4	 The disciples found the young donkey in the street. It was tied to the door of a house. As they were untying it, 
MRK.11.5	 some men standing there asked them, “Why are you untying that donkey?” 
MRK.11.6	 The disciples answered them as Jesus had told them. So the men let them go.
MRK.11.7	 They brought the donkey to Jesus, put their coats on it, and he sat on it. 
MRK.11.8	 Many spread their coats on the road. Others cut leafy branches in the fields and spread them on the road. 
MRK.11.9	 Those who went ahead and those who followed him were shouting,
MRK.11.9	“Hosanna!
MRK.11.9	Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!
MRK.11.10	 Blessed is our ancestor David’s kingdom that is coming!
MRK.11.10	Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
MRK.11.11	 Jesus came into Jerusalem and went into the temple courtyard, where he looked around at everything. Since it was already late, he went out with the twelve apostles to Bethany.
MRK.11.12	 The next day, when they left Bethany, Jesus became hungry. 
MRK.11.13	 In the distance he saw a fig tree with leaves. He went to see if he could find any figs on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves because it wasn’t the season for figs. 
MRK.11.14	 Then he said to the tree, “No one will ever eat fruit from you again!” His disciples heard this.
MRK.11.15	 When they came to Jerusalem, Jesus went into the temple courtyard and began to throw out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the moneychangers’ tables and the chairs of those who sold pigeons. 
MRK.11.16	 He would not let anyone carry anything across the temple courtyard.
MRK.11.17	 Then he taught them by saying, “Scripture says, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations,’ but you have turned it into a gathering place for thieves.”
MRK.11.18	 When the chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings heard him, they looked for a way to kill him. They were afraid of him because he amazed all the crowds with his teaching.
MRK.11.19	 (Every evening Jesus and his disciples would leave the city.)
MRK.11.20	 While Jesus and his disciples were walking early in the morning, they saw that the fig tree had dried up. 
MRK.11.21	 Peter remembered ⌊what Jesus had said⌋, so he said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has dried up.”
MRK.11.22	 Jesus said to them, “Have faith in God! 
MRK.11.23	 I can guarantee this truth: This is what will be done for someone who doesn’t doubt but believes what he says will happen: He can say to this mountain, ‘Be uprooted and thrown into the sea,’ and it will be done for him. 
MRK.11.24	 That’s why I tell you to have faith that you have already received whatever you pray for, and it will be yours. 
MRK.11.25	 Whenever you pray, forgive anything you have against anyone. Then your Father in heaven will forgive your failures.” 
MRK.11.27	 Jesus and his disciples returned to Jerusalem. As he was walking in the temple courtyard, the chief priests, the experts in Moses’ Teachings, and the leaders came to him. 
MRK.11.28	 They asked him, “What gives you the right to do these things? Who told you that you could do this?”
MRK.11.29	 Jesus said to them, “I’ll ask you a question. Answer me, and then I’ll tell you why I have the right to do these things. 
MRK.11.30	 Did John’s right to baptize come from heaven or from humans? Answer me!”
MRK.11.31	 They discussed this among themselves. They said, “If we say, ‘from heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 
MRK.11.32	 But if we say, ‘from humans,’ ⌊then what will happen⌋?” They were afraid of the people. All the people thought of John as a true prophet. 
MRK.11.33	 So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”
MRK.11.33	Jesus told them, “Then I won’t tell you why I have the right to do these things.”
MRK.12.1	 Then, using this illustration, Jesus spoke to them. He said, “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, made a vat for the winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to vineyard workers and went on a trip.
MRK.12.2	 “At the right time he sent a servant to the workers to collect from them a share of the grapes from the vineyard. 
MRK.12.3	 The workers took the servant, beat him, and sent him back with nothing. 
MRK.12.4	 So the man sent another servant to them. They hit the servant on the head and treated him shamefully. 
MRK.12.5	 The man sent another, and they killed that servant. Then he sent many other servants. Some of these they beat, and others they killed.
MRK.12.6	 “He had one more person to send. That person was his son, whom he loved. Finally, he sent his son to them. He thought, ‘They will respect my son.’
MRK.12.7	 “But those workers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ 
MRK.12.8	 So they took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
MRK.12.9	 “What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the workers and give the vineyard to others. 
MRK.12.10	 Have you never read the Scripture passage:
MRK.12.10	‘The stone that the builders rejected
MRK.12.10	has become the cornerstone.
MRK.12.11	 The Lord has done this,
MRK.12.11	and it is amazing for us to see’?”
MRK.12.12	 They wanted to arrest him but were afraid of the crowd. They knew that he had directed this illustration at them. So they left him alone and went away.
MRK.12.13	 The leaders sent some of the Pharisees and some of Herod’s followers to Jesus. They wanted to trap him into saying the wrong thing. 
MRK.12.14	 When they came to him, they said, “Teacher, we know that you tell the truth. You don’t favor individuals because of who they are. Rather, you teach the way of God truthfully. Is it right to pay taxes to the emperor or not? Should we pay taxes or not?”
MRK.12.15	 Jesus recognized their hypocrisy, so he asked them, “Why do you test me? Bring me a coin so that I can look at it.”
MRK.12.16	 They brought a coin. He said to them, “Whose face and name is this?”
MRK.12.16	They told him, “The emperor’s.”
MRK.12.17	 Jesus said to them, “Give the emperor what belongs to the emperor, and give God what belongs to God.”
MRK.12.17	They were surprised at his reply.
MRK.12.18	 Some Sadducees, who say that people will never come back to life, came to Jesus. They asked him, 
MRK.12.19	 “Teacher, Moses wrote for us, ‘If a man dies and leaves a wife but no child, his brother should marry his widow and have children for his brother.’ 
MRK.12.20	 There were seven brothers. The first got married and died without having children. 
MRK.12.21	 The second married her and died without having children. So did the third. 
MRK.12.22	 None of the seven brothers had any children. Last of all, the woman died. 
MRK.12.23	 When the dead come back to life, whose wife will she be? The seven brothers had married her.”
MRK.12.24	 Jesus said to them, “Aren’t you mistaken because you don’t know the Scriptures or God’s power? 
MRK.12.25	 When the dead come back to life, they don’t marry. Rather, they are like the angels in heaven. 
MRK.12.26	 Haven’t you read in the book of Moses that the dead come back to life? It’s in the passage about the bush, where God said, ‘I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ 
MRK.12.27	 He’s not the God of the dead but of the living. You’re badly mistaken!”
MRK.12.28	 One of the experts in Moses’ Teachings went to Jesus during the argument with the Sadducees. He saw how well Jesus answered them, so he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of them all?”
MRK.12.29	 Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Listen, Israel, the Lord our God is the only Lord. 
MRK.12.30	 So love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ 
MRK.12.31	 The second most important commandment is this: ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ No other commandment is greater than these.”
MRK.12.32	 The expert in Moses’ Teachings said to Jesus, “Teacher, that was well said! You’ve told the truth that there is only one God and no other besides him! 
MRK.12.33	 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as you love yourself is more important than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
MRK.12.34	 When Jesus heard how wisely the man answered, he told the man, “You’re not too far from the kingdom of God.”
MRK.12.34	After that, no one dared to ask him another question.
MRK.12.35	 While Jesus was teaching in the temple courtyard, he asked, “How can the experts in Moses’ Teachings say that the Messiah is David’s son? 
MRK.12.36	 David, guided by the Holy Spirit, said,
MRK.12.36	‘The Lord said to my Lord:
MRK.12.36	“Take the highest position in heaven
MRK.12.36	until I put your enemies under your control.” ’
MRK.12.37	 David calls him Lord. So how can he be his son?”
MRK.12.37	The large crowd enjoyed listening to him. 
MRK.12.38	 As he taught, he said, “Watch out for the experts in Moses’ Teachings! They like to walk around in long robes, to be greeted in the marketplaces, 
MRK.12.39	 and to have the front seats in synagogues and the places of honor at dinners. 
MRK.12.40	 They rob widows by taking their houses and then say long prayers to make themselves look good. The experts in Moses’ Teachings will receive the most severe punishment.”
MRK.12.41	 As Jesus sat facing the temple offering box, he watched how ⌊much⌋ money people put into it. Many rich people put in large amounts. 
MRK.12.42	 A poor widow dropped in two small coins, worth less than a cent.
MRK.12.43	 He called his disciples and said to them, “I can guarantee this truth: This poor widow has given more than all the others. 
MRK.12.44	 All of them have given what they could spare. But she, in her poverty, has given everything she had to live on.”
MRK.13.1	 As Jesus was going out of the temple courtyard, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look at these huge stones and these beautiful buildings!”
MRK.13.2	 Jesus said to him, “Do you see these large buildings? Not one of these stones will be left on top of another. Each one will be torn down.”
MRK.13.3	 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives facing the temple buildings, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, 
MRK.13.4	 “Tell us, when will this happen? What will be the sign when all this will come to an end?”
MRK.13.5	 Jesus answered them, “Be careful not to let anyone deceive you. 
MRK.13.6	 Many will come using my name. They will say, ‘I am he,’ and they will deceive many people.
MRK.13.7	 “When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don’t be alarmed! These things must happen, but they don’t mean that the end has come. 
MRK.13.8	 Nation will fight against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines in various places. These are only the beginning pains ⌊of the end⌋.
MRK.13.9	 “Be on your guard! People will hand you over to the Jewish courts and whip you in their synagogues. You will stand in front of governors and kings to testify to them because of me. 
MRK.13.10	 But first, the Good News must be spread to all nations. 
MRK.13.11	 When they take you away to hand you over to the authorities, don’t worry ahead of time about what you will say. Instead, say whatever is given to you to say when the time comes. Indeed, you are not the one who will be speaking, but the Holy Spirit will.
MRK.13.12	 “Brother will hand over brother to death; a father will hand over his child. Children will rebel against their parents and kill them. 
MRK.13.13	 Everyone will hate you because you are committed to me. But the person who endures to the end will be saved.
MRK.13.14	 “When you see the disgusting thing that will cause destruction standing where it should not (let the reader take note), those of you in Judea should flee to the mountains. 
MRK.13.15	 Those who are on the roof should not come down to get anything out of their houses. 
MRK.13.16	 Those who are in the field should not turn back to get their coats.
MRK.13.17	 “How horrible it will be for the women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days. 
MRK.13.18	 Pray that it will not be in winter. 
MRK.13.19	 It will be a time of misery that has not happened from the beginning of God’s creation until now, and will certainly never happen again. 
MRK.13.20	 If the Lord does not reduce that time, no one will be saved. But those days will be reduced because of those whom God has chosen.
MRK.13.21	 “At that time don’t believe anyone who tells you, ‘Here is the Messiah!’ or ‘There he is!’ 
MRK.13.22	 False messiahs and false prophets will appear. They will work miraculous signs and do wonderful things to deceive, if possible, those whom God has chosen. 
MRK.13.23	 Be on your guard! I have told you everything before it happens.
MRK.13.24	 “Now, after the misery of those days, the sun will turn dark, the moon will not give light, 
MRK.13.25	 the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the universe will be shaken.
MRK.13.26	 “Then people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. 
MRK.13.27	 He will send out his angels, and from every direction under the sky, they will gather those whom God has chosen.
MRK.13.28	 “Learn from the story of the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and it sprouts leaves, you know summer is near. 
MRK.13.29	 In the same way, when you see these things happen, you know that he is near, at the door.
MRK.13.30	 “I can guarantee this truth: This generation will not disappear until all these things take place. 
MRK.13.31	 The earth and the heavens will disappear, but my words will never disappear.
MRK.13.32	 “No one knows when that day or hour will come. Even the angels in heaven and the Son don’t know. Only the Father knows. 
MRK.13.33	 Be careful! Watch! You don’t know the exact time. 
MRK.13.34	 It is like a man who went on a trip. As he left home, he put his servants in charge. He assigned work to each one and ordered the guard to be alert. 
MRK.13.35	 Therefore, be alert, because you don’t know when the owner of the house will return. It could be in the evening or at midnight or at dawn or in the morning. 
MRK.13.36	 Make sure he doesn’t come suddenly and find you asleep. 
MRK.13.37	 I’m telling everyone what I’m telling you: ‘Be alert!’ ”
MRK.14.1	 It was two days before the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings were looking for some underhanded way to arrest Jesus and to kill him. 
MRK.14.2	 However, they said, “We shouldn’t arrest him during the festival, or else there will be a riot among the people.”
MRK.14.3	 Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon, a man who had suffered from a skin disease. While Jesus was sitting there, a woman went to him. She had a bottle of very expensive perfume made from pure nard. She opened the bottle and poured the perfume on his head.
MRK.14.4	 Some who were there were irritated and said to one another, “Why was the perfume wasted like this? 
MRK.14.5	 This perfume could have been sold for a high price, and the money could have been given to the poor.” So they said some very unkind things to her.
MRK.14.6	 Jesus said, “Leave her alone! Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me. 
MRK.14.7	 You will always have the poor with you and can help them whenever you want. But you will not always have me with you. 
MRK.14.8	 She did what she could. She came to pour perfume on my body before it is placed in a tomb. 
MRK.14.9	 I can guarantee this truth: Wherever the Good News is spoken in the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”
MRK.14.10	 Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus. 
MRK.14.11	 They were pleased to hear what Judas had to say and promised to give him money. So he kept looking for a chance to betray Jesus.
MRK.14.12	 Killing the Passover lamb was customary on the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples asked Jesus, “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?”
MRK.14.13	 He sent two of his disciples and told them, “Go into the city. You will meet a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him. 
MRK.14.14	 When he goes into a house, tell the owner that the teacher asks, ‘Where is my room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?’ 
MRK.14.15	 He will take you upstairs and show you a large room. The room will be completely furnished. Get everything ready for us there.”
MRK.14.16	 The disciples left. They went into the city and found everything as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
MRK.14.17	 When evening came, Jesus arrived with the twelve apostles.
MRK.14.18	 While they were at the table eating, Jesus said, “I can guarantee this truth: One of you is going to betray me, one who is eating with me!”
MRK.14.19	 Feeling hurt, they asked him one by one, “You don’t mean me, do you?”
MRK.14.20	 He said to them, “It’s one of you twelve, someone dipping his hand into the bowl with me. 
MRK.14.21	 The Son of Man is going to die as the Scriptures say he will. But how horrible it will be for that person who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for that person if he had never been born.”
MRK.14.22	 While they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it. He broke the bread, gave it to them, and said, “Take this. This is my body.”
MRK.14.23	 Then he took a cup, spoke a prayer of thanksgiving, and gave the cup to them. They all drank from it. 
MRK.14.24	 He said to them, “This is my blood, the blood of the promise.
MRK.14.25	 “I can guarantee this truth: I won’t drink this wine again until that day when I drink new wine in the kingdom of God.”
MRK.14.26	 After they sang a hymn, they went to the Mount of Olives.
MRK.14.27	 Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will abandon me. Scripture says,
MRK.14.27	‘I will strike the shepherd,
MRK.14.27	and the sheep will be scattered.’
MRK.14.28	 “But after I am brought back to life, I will go to Galilee ahead of you.”
MRK.14.29	 Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else abandons you, I won’t.”
MRK.14.30	 Jesus said to Peter, “I can guarantee this truth: Tonight, before a rooster crows twice, you will say three times that you don’t know me.”
MRK.14.31	 But Peter said very strongly, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never say that I don’t know you.” All the other disciples said the same thing.
MRK.14.32	 Then they came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, “Stay here while I pray.”
MRK.14.33	 He took Peter, James, and John with him and began to feel distressed and anguished. 
MRK.14.34	 He said to them, “My anguish is so great that I feel as if I’m dying. Wait here, and stay awake.”
MRK.14.35	 After walking a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if it were possible he might not have to suffer what was ahead of him. 
MRK.14.36	 He said, “Abba! 
MRK.14.37	 He went back and found them asleep. He said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you stay awake for one hour? 
MRK.14.38	 Stay awake, and pray that you won’t be tempted. You want to do what’s right, but you’re weak.”
MRK.14.39	 He went away again and prayed the same prayer as before. 
MRK.14.40	 He found them asleep because they couldn’t keep their eyes open. They didn’t even know what they should say to him.
MRK.14.41	 He came back a third time and said to them, “You might as well sleep now. It’s all over.
MRK.14.42	 Get up! Let’s go! The one who is betraying me is near.”
MRK.14.43	 Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve apostles, arrived. A crowd carrying swords and clubs was with him. They were from the chief priests, the experts in Moses’ Teachings, and the leaders of the people. 
MRK.14.44	 Now, the traitor had given them a signal. He said, “The one I kiss is the man you want. Arrest him, and guard him closely as you take him away.”
MRK.14.45	 Then Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.
MRK.14.46	 Some men took hold of Jesus and arrested him. 
MRK.14.47	 One of those standing there pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of the chief priest’s servant.
MRK.14.48	 Jesus asked them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a criminal? 
MRK.14.49	 I used to teach in the temple courtyard every day. But you didn’t arrest me then. But what the Scriptures say must come true.”
MRK.14.50	 Then all the disciples abandoned him and ran away.
MRK.14.51	 A certain young man was following Jesus. He had nothing on but a linen sheet. They tried to arrest him, 
MRK.14.52	 but he left the linen sheet behind and ran away naked.
MRK.14.53	 The men took Jesus to the chief priest. All the chief priests, the leaders, and the experts in Moses’ Teachings had gathered together. 
MRK.14.54	 Peter followed him at a distance and went into the chief priest’s courtyard. He sat with the guards and warmed himself facing the glow of a fire.
MRK.14.55	 The chief priests and the whole Jewish council were searching for some testimony against Jesus in order to execute him. But they couldn’t find any. 
MRK.14.56	 Many gave false testimony against him, but their statements did not agree.
MRK.14.57	 Then some men stood up and gave false testimony against him. They said, 
MRK.14.58	 “We heard him say, ‘I’ll tear down this temple made by humans, and in three days I’ll build another temple, one not made by human hands.’” 
MRK.14.59	 But their testimony did not agree even on this point.
MRK.14.60	 So the chief priest stood up in the center and asked Jesus, “Don’t you have any answer to what these men testify against you?”
MRK.14.61	 But he was silent.
MRK.14.61	The chief priest asked him again, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?”
MRK.14.62	 Jesus answered, “Yes, I am, and you will see the Son of Man in the highest position in heaven. He will be coming with the clouds of heaven.”
MRK.14.63	 The chief priest tore his clothes in horror and said, “Why do we need any more witnesses? 
MRK.14.64	 You’ve heard him dishonor God! What’s your verdict?”
MRK.14.64	All of them condemned him with the death sentence. 
MRK.14.65	 Some of them began to spit on him. They covered his face and hit him with their fists. They said to him, “Prophesy!” Even the guards took him and slapped him.
MRK.14.66	 Peter was in the courtyard. One of the chief priest’s female servants 
MRK.14.67	 saw Peter warming himself. She looked at him and said, “You, too, were with Jesus from Nazareth!”
MRK.14.68	 But Peter denied it by saying, “I don’t know him, and I don’t understand what you’re talking about.”
MRK.14.68	He went to the entrance. Then a rooster crowed.
MRK.14.69	 The servant saw him. Once again she said to those who were standing around, “This man is one of them!” 
MRK.14.70	 Peter again denied it.
MRK.14.70	After a little while the men standing there said to Peter again, “It’s obvious you’re one of them. You’re a Galilean!”
MRK.14.71	 Then Peter began to curse and swear with an oath, “I don’t know this man you’re talking about!” 
MRK.14.72	 Just then a rooster crowed a second time. Peter remembered that Jesus said to him, “Before a rooster crows twice, you will say three times that you don’t know me.” Then Peter began to cry very hard.
MRK.15.1	 Early in the morning the chief priests immediately came to a decision with the leaders and the experts in Moses’ Teachings. The whole Jewish council decided to tie Jesus up, lead him away, and hand him over to Pilate.
MRK.15.2	 Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
MRK.15.2	“Yes, I am,” Jesus answered him.
MRK.15.3	 The chief priests were accusing him of many things.
MRK.15.4	 So Pilate asked him again, “Don’t you have any answer? Look how many accusations they’re bringing against you!”
MRK.15.5	 But Jesus no longer answered anything, so Pilate was surprised.
MRK.15.6	 At every Passover festival, Pilate would free one prisoner whom the people asked for. 
MRK.15.7	 There was a man named Barabbas in prison. He was with some rebels who had committed murder during a riot. 
MRK.15.8	 The crowd asked Pilate to do for them what he always did. 
MRK.15.9	 Pilate answered them, “Do you want me to free the king of the Jews for you?” 
MRK.15.10	 Pilate knew that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him because they were jealous.
MRK.15.11	 The chief priests stirred up the crowd so that Pilate would free Barabbas for them instead.
MRK.15.12	 So Pilate again asked them, “Then what should I do with the king of the Jews?”
MRK.15.13	 “Crucify him!” they shouted back.
MRK.15.14	 Pilate said to them, “Why? What has he done wrong?”
MRK.15.14	But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”
MRK.15.15	 Pilate wanted to satisfy the people, so he freed Barabbas for them. But he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified.
MRK.15.16	 The soldiers led Jesus into the courtyard of the palace and called together the whole troop. 
MRK.15.17	 They dressed him in purple, twisted some thorns into a crown, and placed it on his head. 
MRK.15.18	 Then they began to greet him, “Long live the king of the Jews!” 
MRK.15.19	 They kept hitting him on the head with a stick, spitting on him, and kneeling in front of him with false humility.
MRK.15.20	 After the soldiers finished making fun of Jesus, they took off the purple cape and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him out to crucify him. 
MRK.15.21	 A man named Simon from the city of Cyrene was coming ⌊into Jerusalem⌋ from his home in the country. He was the father of Alexander and Rufus. As he was about to pass by, the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus’ cross.
MRK.15.22	 They took Jesus to Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”). 
MRK.15.23	 They tried to give him wine mixed with a drug called myrrh, but he wouldn’t take it. 
MRK.15.24	 Next they crucified him. Then they divided his clothes among themselves by throwing dice to see what each one would get. 
MRK.15.25	 It was nine in the morning when they crucified him. 
MRK.15.26	 There was a written notice of the accusation against him. It read, “The king of the Jews.”
MRK.15.27	 They crucified two criminals with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
MRK.15.29	 Those who passed by insulted him. They shook their heads and said, “What a joke! You were going to tear down God’s temple and build it again in three days. 
MRK.15.30	 Come down from the cross, and save yourself!” 
MRK.15.31	 The chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings made fun of him among themselves in the same way. They said, “He saved others, but he can’t save himself. 
MRK.15.32	 Let the Messiah, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now so that we may see and believe.” Even those who were crucified with him were insulting him.
MRK.15.33	 At noon darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. 
MRK.15.34	 At three o’clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”
MRK.15.35	 When some of the people standing there heard him say that, they said, “Listen! He’s calling Elijah.” 
MRK.15.36	 Someone ran and soaked a sponge in vinegar. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink. The man said, “Let’s see if Elijah comes to take him down.”
MRK.15.37	 Then Jesus cried out in a loud voice and died. 
MRK.15.38	 The curtain in the temple was split in two from top to bottom.
MRK.15.39	 When the officer who stood facing Jesus saw how he gave up his spirit, he said, “Certainly, this man was the Son of God!”
MRK.15.40	 Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary from Magdala, Mary (the mother of young James and Joseph), and Salome. 
MRK.15.41	 They had followed him and supported him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come to Jerusalem with him were there too.
MRK.15.42	 It was Friday evening, before the day of worship, 
MRK.15.43	 when Joseph arrived. He was from the city of Arimathea and was an important member of the Jewish council. He, too, was waiting for the kingdom of God. Joseph boldly went to Pilate’s quarters to ask for the body of Jesus.
MRK.15.44	 Pilate wondered if Jesus had already died. So he summoned the officer to ask him if Jesus was, in fact, dead. 
MRK.15.45	 When the officer had assured him that Jesus was dead, Pilate let Joseph have the corpse.
MRK.15.46	 Joseph had purchased some linen cloth. He took the body down from the cross and wrapped it in the cloth. Then he laid the body in a tomb, which had been cut out of rock, and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 
MRK.15.47	 Mary from Magdala and Mary (the mother of Joses) watched where Jesus was laid.
MRK.16.1	 When the day of worship was over, Mary from Magdala, Mary (the mother of James), and Salome bought spices to go and anoint Jesus.
MRK.16.2	 On Sunday they were going to the tomb very early when the sun had just come up. 
MRK.16.3	 They said to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?” 
MRK.16.4	 When they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away. It was a very large stone. 
MRK.16.5	 As they went into the tomb, they saw a young man. He was dressed in a white robe and sat on the right side. They were panic-stricken.
MRK.16.6	 The young man said to them, “Don’t panic! You’re looking for Jesus from Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been brought back to life. He’s not here. Look at the place where they laid him. 
MRK.16.7	 Go and tell his disciples and Peter that he’s going ahead of them to Galilee. There they will see him, just as he told them.”
MRK.16.8	 They went out of the tomb and ran away. Shock and trembling had overwhelmed them. They didn’t say a thing to anyone, because they were afraid.
MRK.16.9	 After Jesus came back to life early on Sunday, he appeared first to Mary from Magdala, from whom he had forced out seven demons. 
MRK.16.10	 She went and told his friends, who were grieving and crying. 
MRK.16.11	 They didn’t believe her when they heard that he was alive and that she had seen him.
MRK.16.12	 Later Jesus appeared to two disciples as they were walking to their home in the country. He did not look as he usually did. 
MRK.16.13	 They went back and told the others, who did not believe them either. 
MRK.16.14	 Still later Jesus appeared to the eleven apostles while they were eating. He put them to shame for their unbelief and because they were too stubborn to believe those who had seen him alive.
MRK.16.15	 Then Jesus said to them, “So wherever you go in the world, tell everyone the Good News. 
MRK.16.16	 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
MRK.16.17	 “These are the miraculous signs that will accompany believers: They will use the power and authority of my name to force demons out of people. They will speak new languages. 
MRK.16.18	 They will pick up snakes, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them. They will place their hands on the sick and cure them.”
MRK.16.19	 After talking with the apostles, the Lord was taken to heaven, where God gave him the highest position.
MRK.16.20	 The disciples spread ⌊the Good News⌋ everywhere. The Lord worked with them. He confirmed his word by the miraculous signs that accompanied it.
LUK.1.1	 Many have attempted to write about what had taken place among us. 
LUK.1.2	 They received their information from those who had been eyewitnesses and servants of God’s word from the beginning, and they passed it on to us. 
LUK.1.3	 I, too, have followed everything closely from the beginning. So I thought it would be a good idea to write an orderly account for Your Excellency, Theophilus. 
LUK.1.4	 In this way you will know that what you’ve been told is true.
LUK.1.5	 When Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division of priests named after Abijah. Zechariah’s wife Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron. 
LUK.1.6	 Zechariah and Elizabeth had God’s approval. They followed all the Lord’s commands and regulations perfectly. 
LUK.1.7	 Yet, they never had any children because Elizabeth couldn’t become pregnant. Both of them were too old to have children.
LUK.1.8	 Zechariah was on duty with his division of priests. As he served in God’s presence, 
LUK.1.9	 he was chosen by priestly custom to go into the Lord’s temple to burn incense. 
LUK.1.10	 All the people were praying outside while he was burning incense.
LUK.1.11	 Then, to the right of the incense altar, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. 
LUK.1.12	 Zechariah was troubled and overcome with fear.
LUK.1.13	 The angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayer. Your wife Elizabeth will have a son, and you will name him John. 
LUK.1.14	 He will be your pride and joy, and many people will be glad that he was born. 
LUK.1.15	 As far as the Lord is concerned, he will be a great man. He will never drink wine or any other liquor. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. 
LUK.1.16	 He will bring many people in Israel back to the Lord their God. 
LUK.1.17	 He will go ahead of the Lord with the spirit and power that Elijah had. He will change parents’ attitudes toward their children. He will change disobedient people so that they will accept the wisdom of those who have God’s approval. In this way he will prepare the people for their Lord.”
LUK.1.18	 Zechariah said to the angel, “What proof is there for this? I’m an old man, and my wife is beyond her childbearing years.”
LUK.1.19	 The angel answered him, “I’m Gabriel! I stand in God’s presence. God sent me to tell you this good news. 
LUK.1.20	 But because you didn’t believe what I said, you will be unable to talk until the day this happens. Everything will come true at the right time.”
LUK.1.21	 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah. They were amazed that he was staying in the temple so long. 
LUK.1.22	 When he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. So they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. He motioned to them but remained unable to talk.
LUK.1.23	 When the days of his service were over, he went home. 
LUK.1.24	 Later, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and didn’t go out in public for five months. She said, 
LUK.1.25	 “The Lord has done this for me now. He has removed my public disgrace.”
LUK.1.26	 Six months after Elizabeth had become pregnant, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a city in Galilee. 
LUK.1.27	 The angel went to a virgin promised in marriage to a descendant of David named Joseph. The virgin’s name was Mary.
LUK.1.28	 When the angel entered her home, he greeted her and said, “You are favored by the Lord! The Lord is with you.”
LUK.1.29	 She was startled by what the angel said and tried to figure out what this greeting meant.
LUK.1.30	 The angel told her,
LUK.1.30	“Don’t be afraid, Mary. You have found favor 
LUK.1.31	 You will become pregnant, give birth to a son,
LUK.1.31	and name him Jesus.
LUK.1.32	 He will be a great man
LUK.1.32	and will be called the Son of the Most High.
LUK.1.32	The Lord God will give him
LUK.1.32	the throne of his ancestor David.
LUK.1.33	 Your son will be king of Jacob’s people forever,
LUK.1.33	and his kingdom will never end.”
LUK.1.34	 Mary asked the angel, “How can this be? I’ve never had sexual intercourse.”
LUK.1.35	 The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy child developing inside you will be called the Son of God.
LUK.1.36	 “Elizabeth, your relative, is six months pregnant with a son in her old age. People said she couldn’t have a child. 
LUK.1.37	 But nothing is impossible for God.”
LUK.1.38	 Mary answered, “I am the Lord’s servant. Let everything you’ve said happen to me.”
LUK.1.38	Then the angel left her.
LUK.1.39	 Soon afterward, Mary hurried to a city in the mountain region of Judah. 
LUK.1.40	 She entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth.
LUK.1.41	 When Elizabeth heard the greeting, she felt the baby kick. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
LUK.1.42	 She said in a loud voice, “You are the most blessed of all women, and blessed is the child that you will have. 
LUK.1.43	 I feel blessed that the mother of my Lord is visiting me. 
LUK.1.44	 As soon as I heard your greeting, I felt the baby jump for joy. 
LUK.1.45	 You are blessed for believing that the Lord would keep his promise to you.”
LUK.1.46	 Mary said,
LUK.1.46	“My soul praises the Lord’s greatness!
LUK.1.47	 My spirit finds its joy in God, my Savior,
LUK.1.48	 because he has looked favorably on me, his humble servant.
LUK.1.48	“From now on, all people will call me blessed
LUK.1.49	 because the Almighty has done great things to me.
LUK.1.49	His name is holy.
LUK.1.50	 For those who fear him,
LUK.1.50	his mercy lasts throughout every generation.
LUK.1.51	 “He displayed his mighty power.
LUK.1.51	He scattered those who think too highly of themselves.
LUK.1.52	 He pulled strong rulers from their thrones.
LUK.1.52	He honored humble people.
LUK.1.53	 He fed hungry people with good food.
LUK.1.53	He sent rich people away with nothing.
LUK.1.54	 “He remembered to help his servant Israel forever.
LUK.1.55	 This is the promise he made to our ancestors,
LUK.1.55	to Abraham and his descendants.”
LUK.1.56	 Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back home.
LUK.1.57	 When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son. 
LUK.1.58	 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very kind to her, and they shared her joy.
LUK.1.59	 When the child was eight days old, they went ⌊to the temple⌋ to circumcise him. They were going to name him Zechariah after his father. 
LUK.1.60	 But his mother spoke up, “Absolutely not! His name will be John.”
LUK.1.61	 Their friends said to her, “But you don’t have any relatives with that name.”
LUK.1.62	 So they motioned to the baby’s father to see what he wanted to name the child. 
LUK.1.63	 Zechariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” Everyone was amazed.
LUK.1.64	 Suddenly, Zechariah was able to speak, and he began to praise God.
LUK.1.65	 All their neighbors were filled with awe. Throughout the mountain region of Judea, people talked about everything that had happened. 
LUK.1.66	 Everyone who heard about it seriously thought it over and asked, “What does the future hold for this child?” It was clear that the Lord was with him.
LUK.1.67	 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied,
LUK.1.68	 “Praise the Lord God of Israel!
LUK.1.68	He has come to take care of his people
LUK.1.68	and to set them free.
LUK.1.69	 He has raised up a mighty Savior for us
LUK.1.69	in the family of his servant David.
LUK.1.70	 He made this promise through his holy prophets long ago.
LUK.1.71	 He promised to save us from our enemies
LUK.1.71	and from the power of all who hate us.
LUK.1.72	 He has shown his mercy to our ancestors
LUK.1.72	and remembered his holy promise,
LUK.1.73	 the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham.
LUK.1.74	 He promised to rescue us from our enemies’ power
LUK.1.74	so that we could serve him without fear
LUK.1.75	 by being holy and honorable as long as we live.
LUK.1.76	 “You, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High.
LUK.1.76	You will go ahead of the Lord to prepare his way.
LUK.1.77	 You will make his people know that they can be saved
LUK.1.77	through the forgiveness of their sins.
LUK.1.78	 A new day will dawn on us from above
LUK.1.78	because our God is loving and merciful.
LUK.1.79	 He will give light to those who live in the dark
LUK.1.79	and in death’s shadow.
LUK.1.79	He will guide us into the way of peace.”
LUK.1.80	 The child John grew and became spiritually strong. He lived in the desert until the day he appeared to the people of Israel.
LUK.2.1	 At that time the Emperor Augustus ordered a census of the Roman Empire. 
LUK.2.2	 This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. 
LUK.2.3	 All the people went to register in the cities where their ancestors had lived.
LUK.2.4	 So Joseph went from Nazareth, a city in Galilee, to a Judean city called Bethlehem. Joseph, a descendant of King David, went to Bethlehem because David had been born there. 
LUK.2.5	 Joseph went there to register with Mary. She had been promised to him in marriage and was pregnant.
LUK.2.6	 While they were in Bethlehem, the time came for Mary to have her child. 
LUK.2.7	 She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger because there wasn’t any room for them in the inn.
LUK.2.8	 Shepherds were in the fields near Bethlehem. They were taking turns watching their flock during the night. 
LUK.2.9	 An angel from the Lord suddenly appeared to them. The glory of the Lord filled the area with light, and they were terrified. 
LUK.2.10	 The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid! I have good news for you, a message that will fill everyone with joy. 
LUK.2.11	 Today your Savior, Christ the Lord, was born in David’s city. 
LUK.2.12	 This is how you will recognize him: You will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”
LUK.2.13	 Suddenly, a large army of angels appeared with the angel. They were praising God by saying,
LUK.2.14	 “Glory to God in the highest heaven,
LUK.2.14	and on earth peace to those who have his good will!”
LUK.2.15	 The angels left them and went back to heaven. The shepherds said to each other, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see what the Lord has told us about.”
LUK.2.16	 They went quickly and found Mary and Joseph with the baby, who was lying in a manger. 
LUK.2.17	 When they saw the child, they repeated what they had been told about him. 
LUK.2.18	 Everyone who heard the shepherds’ story was amazed.
LUK.2.19	 Mary treasured all these things in her heart and always thought about them.
LUK.2.20	 As the shepherds returned to their flock, they glorified and praised God for everything they had seen and heard. Everything happened the way the angel had told them.
LUK.2.21	 Eight days after his birth, the child was circumcised and named Jesus. This was the name the angel had given him before his mother became pregnant.
LUK.2.22	 After the days required by Moses’ Teachings to make a mother clean 
LUK.2.23	 They did exactly what was written in the Lord’s Teachings: “Every firstborn boy is to be set apart as holy to the Lord.” 
LUK.2.24	 They also offered a sacrifice as required by the Lord’s Teachings: “a pair of mourning doves or two young pigeons.”
LUK.2.25	 A man named Simeon was in Jerusalem. He lived an honorable and devout life. He was waiting for the one who would comfort Israel. The Holy Spirit was with Simeon 
LUK.2.26	 and had told him that he wouldn’t die until he had seen the Messiah, whom the Lord would send.
LUK.2.27	 Moved by the Spirit, Simeon went into the temple courtyard. Mary and Joseph were bringing the child Jesus into the courtyard at the same time. They brought him so that they could do for him what Moses’ Teachings required. 
LUK.2.28	 Then Simeon took the child in his arms and praised God by saying,
LUK.2.29	 “Now, Lord, you are allowing your servant to leave in peace
LUK.2.29	as you promised.
LUK.2.30	 My eyes have seen your salvation,
LUK.2.31	 which you have prepared for all people to see.
LUK.2.32	 He is a light that will reveal ⌊salvation⌋ to the nations
LUK.2.32	and bring glory to your people Israel.”
LUK.2.33	 Jesus’ father and mother were amazed at what was said about him. 
LUK.2.34	 Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, “This child is the reason that many people in Israel will be condemned and many others will be saved. He will be a sign that will expose 
LUK.2.35	 the thoughts of those who reject him. And a sword will pierce your heart.”
LUK.2.36	 Anna, a prophet, was also there. She was a descendant of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher. She was now very old. Her husband had died seven years after they were married, 
LUK.2.37	 and she had been a widow for 84 years. Anna never left the temple courtyard but worshiped day and night by fasting and praying. 
LUK.2.38	 At that moment she came up to Mary and Joseph and began to thank God. She spoke about Jesus to all who were waiting for Jerusalem to be set free.
LUK.2.39	 After doing everything the Lord’s Teachings required, Joseph and Mary returned to their hometown of Nazareth in Galilee. 
LUK.2.40	 The child grew and became strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God’s favor 
LUK.2.41	 Every year Jesus’ parents would go to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. 
LUK.2.42	 When he was 12 years old, they went as usual.
LUK.2.43	 When the festival was over, they left for home. The boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents didn’t know it. 
LUK.2.44	 They thought that he was with the others who were traveling with them. After traveling for a day, they started to look for him among their relatives and friends. 
LUK.2.45	 When they didn’t find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.
LUK.2.46	 Three days later, they found him in the temple courtyard. He was sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking them questions. 
LUK.2.47	 His understanding and his answers stunned everyone who heard him.
LUK.2.48	 When his parents saw him, they were shocked. His mother asked him, “Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been worried sick looking for you!”
LUK.2.49	 Jesus said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you realize that I had to be in my Father’s house?” 
LUK.2.50	 But they didn’t understand what he meant.
LUK.2.51	 Then he returned with them to Nazareth and was obedient to them.
LUK.2.51	His mother treasured all these things in her heart. 
LUK.2.52	 Jesus grew in wisdom and maturity. He gained favor from God and people.
LUK.3.1	 It was the fifteenth year in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius. Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea. Herod ruled Galilee, and his brother Philip ruled Iturea and Trachonitis. Lysanias was the ruler of Abilene. 
LUK.3.2	 It was at the time when Annas and Caiaphas were chief priests that God spoke to John, son of Zechariah, in the desert. 
LUK.3.3	 John traveled throughout the region around the Jordan River. He told people about a baptism of repentance 
LUK.3.4	 As the prophet Isaiah wrote in his book,
LUK.3.4	“A voice cries out in the desert:
LUK.3.4	‘Prepare the way for the Lord!
LUK.3.4	Make his paths straight!
LUK.3.5	 Every valley will be filled.
LUK.3.5	Every mountain and hill will be leveled.
LUK.3.5	The crooked ways will be made straight.
LUK.3.5	The rough roads will be made smooth.
LUK.3.6	 All people will see the salvation that God gives.’ ”
LUK.3.7	 Crowds of people were coming to be baptized by John. He would say to them, “You poisonous snakes! Who showed you how to flee from God’s coming anger? 
LUK.3.8	 Do those things that prove that you have turned to God and have changed the way you think and act. Don’t say, ‘Abraham is our ancestor.’ I guarantee that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones. 
LUK.3.9	 The ax is now ready to cut the roots of the trees. Any tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.”
LUK.3.10	 The crowds asked him, “What should we do?”
LUK.3.11	 He answered them, “Whoever has two shirts should share with the person who doesn’t have any. Whoever has food should share it too.”
LUK.3.12	 Some tax collectors came to be baptized. They asked him, “Teacher, what should we do?”
LUK.3.13	 He told them, “Don’t collect more money than you are ordered to collect.”
LUK.3.14	 Some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?”
LUK.3.14	He told them, “Be satisfied with your pay, and never use threats or blackmail to get money from anyone.”
LUK.3.15	 People’s hopes were rising as they all wondered whether John was the Messiah. 
LUK.3.16	 John replied to all of them, “I baptize you with water. But the one who is more powerful than I is coming. I am not worthy to untie his sandal straps. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 
LUK.3.17	 His winnowing 
LUK.3.18	 With many other encouraging words, he told the Good News to the people.
LUK.3.19	 John spoke out against the ruler Herod because Herod had married his own sister-in-law, Herodias. He also spoke out against Herod for all the evil things he had done. 
LUK.3.20	 So Herod added one more evil to all the others; he locked John in prison.
LUK.3.21	 When all the people were baptized, Jesus, too, was baptized. While he was praying, heaven opened, 
LUK.3.22	 and the Holy Spirit came down to him in the form of a dove. A voice from heaven said, “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you.”
LUK.3.23	 Jesus was about 30 years old when he began ⌊his ministry⌋.
LUK.3.23	Jesus, so people thought, was the son of 
LUK.3.24	 son of 
LUK.3.25	 son of 
LUK.3.26	 son of 
LUK.3.27	 son of 
LUK.3.28	 son of 
LUK.3.29	 son of 
LUK.3.30	 son of 
LUK.3.31	 son of 
LUK.3.32	 son of 
LUK.3.33	 son of 
LUK.3.34	 son of 
LUK.3.35	 son of 
LUK.3.36	 son of 
LUK.3.37	 son of 
LUK.3.38	 son of 
LUK.3.38	son of 
LUK.3.38	son of 
LUK.4.1	 Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit as he left the Jordan River. The Spirit led him while he was in the desert, 
LUK.4.2	 where he was tempted by the devil for 40 days. During those days Jesus ate nothing, so when they were over, he was hungry.
LUK.4.3	 The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.”
LUK.4.4	 Jesus answered him, “Scripture says, ‘A person cannot live on bread alone.’” 
LUK.4.5	 The devil took him to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant. 
LUK.4.6	 The devil said to him, “I will give you all the power and glory of these kingdoms. All of it has been given to me, and I give it to anyone I please. 
LUK.4.7	 So if you will worship me, all this will be yours.”
LUK.4.8	 Jesus answered him, “Scripture says, ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’ ”
LUK.4.9	 Then the devil took him into Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest part of the temple. He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, jump from here! 
LUK.4.10	 Scripture says, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you to watch over you carefully. 
LUK.4.11	 They will carry you in their hands so that you never hit your foot against a rock.’ ”
LUK.4.12	 Jesus answered him, “It has been said, ‘Never tempt the Lord your God.’” 
LUK.4.13	 After the devil had finished tempting Jesus in every possible way, the devil left him until another time.
LUK.4.14	 Jesus returned to Galilee. The power of the Spirit was with him, and the news about him spread throughout the surrounding country. 
LUK.4.15	 He taught in the synagogues, and everyone praised him.
LUK.4.16	 Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. As usual he went into the synagogue on the day of worship. He stood up to read the lesson. 
LUK.4.17	 The attendant gave him the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened it and found the place where it read:
LUK.4.18	 “The Spirit of the Lord is with me.
LUK.4.18	He has anointed me
LUK.4.18	to tell the Good News to the poor.
LUK.4.18	He has sent me 
LUK.4.18	to announce forgiveness to the prisoners of sin
LUK.4.18	and the restoring of sight to the blind,
LUK.4.18	to forgive those who have been shattered by sin,
LUK.4.19	 to announce the year of the Lord’s favor.”
LUK.4.20	 Jesus closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. Everyone in the synagogue watched him closely. 
LUK.4.21	 Then he said to them, “This passage came true today when you heard me read it.”
LUK.4.22	 All the people spoke well of him. They were amazed to hear the gracious words flowing from his lips. They said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”
LUK.4.23	 So he said to them, “You’ll probably quote this proverb to me, ‘Doctor, cure yourself!’ and then say to me, ‘Do all the things in your hometown that we’ve heard you’ve done in Capernaum.’” 
LUK.4.24	 Then Jesus added, “I can guarantee this truth: A prophet isn’t accepted in his hometown.
LUK.4.25	 “I can guarantee this truth: There were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s time. It had not rained for three-and-a-half years, and the famine was severe everywhere in the country. 
LUK.4.26	 But God didn’t send Elijah to anyone except a widow at Zarephath in the territory of Sidon. 
LUK.4.27	 There were also many people with skin diseases in Israel in the prophet Elisha’s time. But God cured no one except Naaman from Syria.”
LUK.4.28	 Everyone in the synagogue became furious when they heard this. 
LUK.4.29	 Their city was built on a hill with a cliff. So they got up, forced Jesus out of the city, and led him to the cliff. They intended to throw him off of it. 
LUK.4.30	 But Jesus walked right by them and went away.
LUK.4.31	 Jesus went to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and taught them on a day of worship. 
LUK.4.32	 The people were amazed at his teachings because he spoke with authority.
LUK.4.33	 In the synagogue was a man possessed by a spirit, an evil demon. He shouted very loudly, 
LUK.4.34	 “Oh, no! What do you want with us, Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
LUK.4.35	 Jesus ordered the spirit, “Keep quiet, and come out of him!” The demon threw the man down in the middle of the synagogue and came out without hurting him.
LUK.4.36	 Everyone was stunned. They said to one another, “What kind of command is this? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits, and they come out.”
LUK.4.37	 So news about him spread to every place throughout the surrounding region.
LUK.4.38	 Jesus left the synagogue and went to Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever. They asked Jesus to help her. 
LUK.4.39	 He bent over her, ordered the fever to leave, and it went away. She got up immediately and prepared a meal for them.
LUK.4.40	 When the sun was setting, everyone who had friends suffering from various diseases brought them to him. He placed his hands on each of them and cured them. 
LUK.4.41	 Demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But Jesus ordered them not to speak. After all, they knew he was the Messiah.
LUK.4.42	 In the morning he went to a place where he could be alone. The crowds searched for him. When they came to him, they tried to keep him from leaving. 
LUK.4.43	 But he said to them, “I have to tell the Good News about the kingdom of God in other cities also. That’s what I was sent to do.”
LUK.4.44	 So he spread his message in the synagogues of Judea.
LUK.5.1	 One day Jesus was standing by the Sea of Galilee. The people crowded around him as they listened to God’s word. 
LUK.5.2	 Jesus saw two boats on the shore. The fishermen had stepped out of them and were washing their nets. 
LUK.5.3	 So Jesus got into the boat that belonged to Simon and asked him to push off a little from the shore. Then Jesus sat down and taught the crowd from the boat.
LUK.5.4	 When he finished speaking, he told Simon, “Take the boat into deep water, and lower your nets to catch some fish.”
LUK.5.5	 Simon answered, “Teacher, we worked hard all night and caught nothing. But if you say so, I’ll lower the nets.”
LUK.5.6	 After the men had done this, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to tear. 
LUK.5.7	 So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. Their partners came and filled both boats until the boats nearly sank.
LUK.5.8	 When Simon Peter saw this, he knelt in front of Jesus and said, “Leave me, Lord! I’m a sinful person!” 
LUK.5.9	 Simon and everyone who was with him were amazed to see the large number of fish they had caught. 
LUK.5.10	 James and John, who were Zebedee’s sons and Simon’s partners, were also amazed.
LUK.5.10	Jesus told Simon, “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will catch people instead of fish.”
LUK.5.11	 Simon and his partners brought the boats to shore, left everything, and followed Jesus.
LUK.5.12	 One day Jesus was in a city where there was a man covered with a serious skin disease. When the man saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground. He begged Jesus, “Sir, if you want to, you can make me clean.” 
LUK.5.13	 Jesus reached out, touched him, and said, “I want to. So be clean!” Immediately, his skin disease went away.
LUK.5.14	 Jesus ordered him, “Don’t tell anyone. Instead, show yourself to the priest. Then offer the sacrifice as Moses commanded as proof to people that you are clean.”
LUK.5.15	 The news about Jesus spread even more. Large crowds gathered to hear him and have their diseases cured. 
LUK.5.16	 But he would go away to places where he could be alone for prayer.
LUK.5.17	 One day when Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and experts in Moses’ Teachings were present. They had come from every village in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. Jesus had the power of the Lord to heal.
LUK.5.18	 Some men brought a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They tried to take him into the house and put him in front of Jesus. 
LUK.5.19	 But they could not find a way to get him into the house because of the crowd. So they went up on the roof. They made an opening in the tiles and let the man down on his stretcher among the people. (They lowered him in front of Jesus.)
LUK.5.20	 When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Sir, your sins are forgiven.” 
LUK.5.21	 The experts in Moses’ Teachings and the Pharisees thought, “Who is this man? He’s dishonoring God! Who besides God can forgive sins?”
LUK.5.22	 Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, “What are you thinking? 
LUK.5.23	 Is it easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? 
LUK.5.24	 I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” Then he said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home.”
LUK.5.25	 The man immediately stood up in front of them and picked up the stretcher he had been lying on. Praising God, he went home.
LUK.5.26	 Everyone was amazed and praised God. They were filled with awe and said, “We’ve seen things today we can hardly believe!”
LUK.5.27	 After that, Jesus left. He saw a tax collector named Levi sitting in a tax office. Jesus said to him, “Follow me!” 
LUK.5.28	 So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.
LUK.5.29	 Levi held a large reception at his home for Jesus. A huge crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.
LUK.5.30	 The Pharisees and their experts in Moses’ Teachings complained to Jesus’ disciples. They asked, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”
LUK.5.31	 Jesus answered them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor; those who are sick do. 
LUK.5.32	 I’ve come to call sinners to change the way they think and act, not to call people who think they have God’s approval.”
LUK.5.33	 They said to him, “John’s disciples frequently fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees. But your disciples eat and drink.”
LUK.5.34	 Jesus asked them, “Can you force wedding guests to fast while the groom is still with them? 
LUK.5.35	 The time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. At that time they will fast.”
LUK.5.36	 He also used these illustrations: “No one tears a piece of cloth from a new coat to patch an old coat. Otherwise, the new cloth will tear the old. Besides, the patch from the new will not match the old. 
LUK.5.37	 People don’t pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will make the skins burst. The wine will run out, and the skins will be ruined. 
LUK.5.38	 Rather, new wine is to be poured into fresh skins.
LUK.5.39	 “No one who has been drinking old wine wants new wine. He says, ‘The old wine is better!’ ”
LUK.6.1	 Once, on a day of worship, Jesus was walking through some grainfields. His disciples were picking the heads of grain, removing the husks, and eating the grain.
LUK.6.2	 Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are your disciples doing something that is not right to do on the day of worship?”
LUK.6.3	 Jesus answered them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his men were hungry? 
LUK.6.4	 Haven’t you read how he went into the house of God, ate the bread of the presence, and gave some of it to the men who were with him? He had no right to eat those loaves. Only the priests have that right.”
LUK.6.5	 Then he added, “The Son of Man has authority over the day of worship.”
LUK.6.6	 On another day of worship, Jesus went into a synagogue to teach. A man whose right hand was paralyzed was there. 
LUK.6.7	 The experts in Moses’ Teachings and the Pharisees were watching Jesus closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the day of worship so that they could find a way to accuse him of doing something wrong.
LUK.6.8	 But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he told the man with the paralyzed hand, “Get up, and stand in the center ⌊of the synagogue⌋!” The man got up and stood there. 
LUK.6.9	 Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you—what is the right thing to do on a day of worship: to do good or evil, to give a person his health or to destroy it?” 
LUK.6.10	 He looked around at all of them and then said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man did so, and his hand became normal again.
LUK.6.11	 The experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees were furious and began to discuss with each other what they could do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	 At that time Jesus went to a mountain to pray. He spent the whole night in prayer to God.
LUK.6.13	 When it was day, he called his disciples. He chose twelve of them and called them apostles. 
LUK.6.14	 They were Simon (whom Jesus named Peter) and Simon’s brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 
LUK.6.15	 Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon (who was called the Zealot), 
LUK.6.16	 Judas (son of James), and Judas Iscariot (who became a traitor).
LUK.6.17	 Jesus came down from the mountain with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples and many other people were there. They had come from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon. 
LUK.6.18	 They wanted to hear him and be cured of their diseases. Those who were tormented by evil spirits were cured. 
LUK.6.19	 The entire crowd was trying to touch him because power was coming from him and curing all of them.
LUK.6.20	 Jesus looked at his disciples and said,
LUK.6.20	“Blessed are those who are poor.
LUK.6.20	The kingdom of God is theirs.
LUK.6.21	 Blessed are those who are hungry.
LUK.6.21	They will be satisfied.
LUK.6.21	Blessed are those who are crying.
LUK.6.21	They will laugh.
LUK.6.22	 Blessed are you when people hate you, avoid you,
LUK.6.22	insult you, and slander you
LUK.6.22	because you are committed to the Son of Man.
LUK.6.23	 Rejoice then, and be very happy!
LUK.6.23	You have a great reward in heaven.
LUK.6.23	That’s the way their ancestors treated the prophets.
LUK.6.24	 “But how horrible it will be for those who are rich.
LUK.6.24	They have had their comfort.
LUK.6.25	 How horrible it will be for those who are well-fed.
LUK.6.25	They will be hungry.
LUK.6.25	How horrible it will be for those who are laughing.
LUK.6.25	They will mourn and cry.
LUK.6.26	 How horrible it will be for you
LUK.6.26	when everyone says nice things about you.
LUK.6.26	That’s the way their ancestors treated the false prophets.
LUK.6.27	 “But I tell everyone who is listening: Love your enemies. Be kind to those who hate you. 
LUK.6.28	 Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who insult you. 
LUK.6.29	 If someone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other cheek as well. If someone takes your coat, don’t stop him from taking your shirt. 
LUK.6.30	 Give to everyone who asks you for something. If someone takes what is yours, don’t insist on getting it back.
LUK.6.31	 “Do for other people everything you want them to do for you.
LUK.6.32	 “If you love those who love you, do you deserve any thanks for that? Even sinners love those who love them. 
LUK.6.33	 If you help those who help you, do you deserve any thanks for that? Sinners do that too. 
LUK.6.34	 If you lend anything to those from whom you expect to get something back, do you deserve any thanks for that? Sinners also lend to sinners to get back what they lend. 
LUK.6.35	 Rather, love your enemies, help them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then you will have a great reward. You will be the children of the Most High God. After all, he is kind to unthankful and evil people. 
LUK.6.36	 Be merciful as your Father is merciful.
LUK.6.37	 “Stop judging, and you will never be judged. Stop condemning, and you will never be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. 
LUK.6.38	 Give, and you will receive. A large quantity, pressed together, shaken down, and running over will be put into your pocket. The standards you use for others will be applied to you.”
LUK.6.39	 Jesus also gave them this illustration: “Can one blind person lead another? Won’t both fall into the same pit? 
LUK.6.40	 A student is no better than his teacher. But everyone who is well-trained will be like his teacher.
LUK.6.41	 “Why do you see the piece of sawdust in another believer’s eye and not notice the wooden beam in your own eye? 
LUK.6.42	 How can you say to another believer, ‘Friend, let me take the piece of sawdust out of your eye,’ when you don’t see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the piece of sawdust from another believer’s eye.
LUK.6.43	 “A good tree doesn’t produce rotten fruit, and a rotten tree doesn’t produce good fruit. 
LUK.6.44	 Each tree is known by its fruit. You don’t pick figs from thorny plants or grapes from a thornbush. 
LUK.6.45	 Good people do the good that is in them. But evil people do the evil that is in them. The things people say come from inside them.
LUK.6.46	 “Why do you call me Lord but don’t do what I tell you?
LUK.6.47	 “I will show you what everyone who comes to me, hears what I say, and obeys it is like. 
LUK.6.48	 He is like a person who dug down to bedrock to lay the foundation of his home. When a flood came, the floodwaters pushed against that house. But the house couldn’t be washed away because it had a good foundation. 
LUK.6.49	 The person who hears ⌊what I say⌋ but doesn’t obey it is like someone who built a house on the ground without any foundation. The floodwaters pushed against it, and that house quickly collapsed and was destroyed.”
LUK.7.1	 When Jesus had finished everything he wanted to say to the people, he went to Capernaum. 
LUK.7.2	 There a Roman army officer’s valuable slave was sick and near death. 
LUK.7.3	 The officer had heard about Jesus and sent some Jewish leaders to him. They were to ask Jesus to come and save the servant’s life. 
LUK.7.4	 They came to Jesus and begged, “He deserves your help. 
LUK.7.5	 He loves our people and built our synagogue at his own expense.”
LUK.7.6	 Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the officer sent friends to tell Jesus, “Sir, don’t bother. I don’t deserve to have you come into my house. 
LUK.7.7	 That’s why I didn’t come to you. But just give a command, and let my servant be cured. 
LUK.7.8	 As you know, I’m in a chain of command and have soldiers at my command. I tell one of them, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and another, ‘Come!’ and he comes. I tell my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
LUK.7.9	 Jesus was amazed at the officer when he heard these words. He turned to the crowd following him and said, “I can guarantee that I haven’t found faith as great as this in Israel.”
LUK.7.10	 When the men who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant healthy again.
LUK.7.11	 Soon afterward, Jesus went to a city called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd went with him. 
LUK.7.12	 As he came near the entrance to the city, he met a funeral procession. The dead man was a widow’s only child. A large crowd from the city was with her.
LUK.7.13	 When the Lord saw her, he felt sorry for her. He said to her, “Don’t cry.”
LUK.7.14	 He went up to the open coffin, took hold of it, and the men who were carrying it stopped. He said, “Young man, I’m telling you to come back to life!” 
LUK.7.15	 The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
LUK.7.16	 Everyone was struck with fear and praised God. They said, “A great prophet has appeared among us,” and “God has taken care of his people.” 
LUK.7.17	 This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding region.
LUK.7.18	 John’s disciples told him about all these things. Then John called two of his disciples 
LUK.7.19	 and sent them to ask the Lord, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for someone else?”
LUK.7.20	 The men came to Jesus and said, “John the Baptizer sent us to ask you, ‘Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for someone else?’ ”
LUK.7.21	 At that time Jesus was curing many people who had diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits. Also, he was giving back sight to many who were blind.
LUK.7.22	 Jesus answered John’s disciples, “Go back, and tell John what you have seen and heard: Blind people see again, lame people are walking, those with skin diseases are made clean,
LUK.7.23	 Whoever doesn’t lose his faith in me is indeed blessed.”
LUK.7.24	 When John’s messengers had left, Jesus spoke to the crowds about John. “What did you go into the desert to see? Tall grass swaying in the wind? 
LUK.7.25	 Really, what did you go to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear splendid clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces. 
LUK.7.26	 Really, what did you go to see? A prophet? Let me tell you that he is far more than a prophet. 
LUK.7.27	 John is the one about whom Scripture says,
LUK.7.27	‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you
LUK.7.27	to prepare the way in front of you.’
LUK.7.28	 I can guarantee that of all the people ever born, no one is greater than John. Yet, the least important person in the kingdom of God is greater than John.
LUK.7.29	 “All the people, including tax collectors, heard John. They admitted that God was right by letting John baptize them. 
LUK.7.30	 But the Pharisees and the experts in Moses’ Teachings rejected God’s plan for them. They refused to be baptized.
LUK.7.31	 “How can I describe the people who are living now? What are they like? 
LUK.7.32	 They are like children who sit in the marketplace and shout to each other,
LUK.7.32	‘We played music for you,
LUK.7.32	but you didn’t dance.
LUK.7.32	We sang a funeral song,
LUK.7.32	but you didn’t cry.’
LUK.7.33	 John the Baptizer has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘There’s a demon in him!’ 
LUK.7.34	 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him! He’s a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’
LUK.7.35	 “Yet, wisdom is proved right by all its results.”
LUK.7.36	 One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him. Jesus went to the Pharisee’s house and was eating at the table.
LUK.7.37	 A woman who lived a sinful life in that city found out that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house. So she took a bottle of perfume 
LUK.7.38	 and knelt at his feet. She was crying and washed his feet with her tears. Then she dried his feet with her hair, kissed them over and over again, and poured the perfume on them.
LUK.7.39	 The Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this and thought, “If this man really were a prophet, he would know what sort of woman is touching him. She’s a sinner.”
LUK.7.40	 Jesus spoke up, “Simon, I have something to say to you.”
LUK.7.40	Simon replied, “Teacher, you’re free to speak.”
LUK.7.41	 ⌊So Jesus said,⌋ “Two men owed a moneylender some money. One owed him five hundred silver coins, and the other owed him fifty. 
LUK.7.42	 When they couldn’t pay it back, he was kind enough to cancel their debts. Now, who do you think will love him the most?”
LUK.7.43	 Simon answered, “I suppose the one who had the largest debt canceled.”
LUK.7.43	Jesus said to him, “You’re right!” 
LUK.7.44	 Then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, “You see this woman, don’t you? I came into your house. You didn’t wash my feet. But she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. 
LUK.7.45	 You didn’t give me a kiss. But ever since I came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet. 
LUK.7.46	 You didn’t put any olive oil on my head. But she has poured perfume on my feet. 
LUK.7.47	 That’s why I’m telling you that her many sins have been forgiven. Her great love proves that. But whoever receives little forgiveness loves very little.”
LUK.7.48	 Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins have been forgiven.” 
LUK.7.49	 The other guests thought, “Who is this man who even forgives sins?”
LUK.7.50	 Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace!”
LUK.8.1	 After this, Jesus traveled from one city and village to another. He spread the Good News about God’s kingdom. The twelve apostles were with him. 
LUK.8.2	 Also, some women were with him. They had been cured from evil spirits and various illnesses. These women were Mary, also called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out; 
LUK.8.3	 Joanna, whose husband Chusa was Herod’s administrator; Susanna; and many other women. They provided financial support for Jesus and his disciples.
LUK.8.4	 When a large crowd had gathered and people had come to Jesus from every city, he used this story as an illustration: 
LUK.8.5	 “A farmer went to plant his seeds. Some seeds were planted along the road, were trampled, and were devoured by birds. 
LUK.8.6	 Others were planted on rocky soil. When the plants came up, they withered because they had no moisture. 
LUK.8.7	 Others were planted among thornbushes. The thornbushes grew up with them and choked them. 
LUK.8.8	 Others were planted on good ground. When they came up, they produced a hundred times as much as was planted.”
LUK.8.8	After he had said this, he called out, “Let the person who has ears listen!”
LUK.8.9	 His disciples asked him what this story meant. 
LUK.8.10	 Jesus answered, “Knowledge about the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been given ⌊directly⌋ to you. But it is given to others in stories. When they look, they don’t see, and when they hear, they don’t understand.
LUK.8.11	 “This is what the story illustrates: The seed is God’s word. 
LUK.8.12	 Some people are like seeds that were planted along the road. They hear the word, but then the devil comes. He takes the word away from them so that they don’t believe and become saved. 
LUK.8.13	 Some people are like seeds on rocky soil. They welcome the word with joy whenever they hear it, but they don’t develop any roots. They believe for a while, but when their faith is tested, they abandon it. 
LUK.8.14	 The seeds that were planted among thornbushes are people who hear the word, but as life goes on the worries, riches, and pleasures of life choke them. So they don’t produce anything good. 
LUK.8.15	 The seeds that were planted on good ground are people who also hear the word. But they keep it in their good and honest hearts and produce what is good despite what life may bring.
LUK.8.16	 “No one lights a lamp and hides it under a bowl or puts it under a bed. Instead, everyone who lights a lamp puts it on a lamp stand so that those who come in will see the light. 
LUK.8.17	 There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. There is nothing kept secret that will not come to light.
LUK.8.18	 “So pay attention to how you listen! Those who understand ⌊these mysteries⌋ will be given ⌊more knowledge⌋. However, some people don’t understand ⌊these mysteries⌋. Even what they think they understand will be taken away from them.”
LUK.8.19	 His mother and his brothers came to see him. But they couldn’t meet with him because of the crowd. 
LUK.8.20	 Someone told Jesus, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside. They want to see you.”
LUK.8.21	 He answered them, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear and do what God’s word says.”
LUK.8.22	 One day Jesus and his disciples got into a boat. He said to them, “Let’s cross to the other side of the lake.” So they started out. 
LUK.8.23	 As they were sailing along, Jesus fell asleep.
LUK.8.23	A violent storm came across the lake. The boat was taking on water, and they were in danger. 
LUK.8.24	 They went to him, woke him up, and said, “Master! Master! We’re going to die!”
LUK.8.24	Then he got up and ordered the wind and the waves to stop. The wind stopped, and the sea became calm. 
LUK.8.25	 He asked them, “Where is your faith?”
LUK.8.25	Frightened and amazed, they asked each other, “Who is this man? He gives orders to the wind and the water, and they obey him!”
LUK.8.26	 They landed in the region of the Gerasenes across from Galilee. 
LUK.8.27	 When Jesus stepped out on the shore, a certain man from the city met him. The man was possessed by demons and had not worn clothes for a long time. He would not stay in a house but lived in the tombs. 
LUK.8.28	 When he saw Jesus, he shouted, fell in front of him, and said in a loud voice, “Why are you bothering me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torture me!” 
LUK.8.29	 Jesus ordered the evil spirit to come out of the man. (The evil spirit had controlled the man for a long time. People had kept him under guard. He was chained hand and foot. But he would break the chains. Then the demon would force him to go into the desert.)
LUK.8.30	 Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”
LUK.8.30	He answered, “Legion [Six Thousand].” (Many demons had entered him.) 
LUK.8.31	 The demons begged Jesus not to order them to go into the bottomless pit.
LUK.8.32	 A large herd of pigs was feeding on a mountainside. The demons begged Jesus to let them enter those pigs. So he let them do this. 
LUK.8.33	 The demons came out of the man and went into the pigs. Then the herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned.
LUK.8.34	 When those who had taken care of the pigs saw what had happened, they ran away. They reported everything in the city and countryside. 
LUK.8.35	 The people went to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out. Dressed and in his right mind, he was sitting at Jesus’ feet. The people were frightened. 
LUK.8.36	 Those who had seen this told the people how Jesus had restored the demon-possessed man to health.
LUK.8.37	 Then all the people from the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave because they were terrified.
LUK.8.37	Jesus got into a boat and started back. 
LUK.8.38	 The man from whom the demons had gone out begged him, “Let me go with you.”
LUK.8.38	But Jesus sent the man away and told him, 
LUK.8.39	 “Go home to your family, and tell them how much God has done for you.” So the man left. He went through the whole city and told people how much Jesus had done for him.
LUK.8.40	 When Jesus came back, a crowd welcomed him. Everyone was expecting him.
LUK.8.41	 A man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, arrived and quickly bowed down in front of Jesus. He begged Jesus to come to his home. 
LUK.8.42	 His only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus went, the people were crowding around him.
LUK.8.43	 A woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years was in the crowd. No one could cure her. 
LUK.8.44	 She came up behind Jesus, touched the edge of his clothes, and her bleeding stopped at once.
LUK.8.45	 Jesus asked, “Who touched me?”
LUK.8.45	After everyone denied touching him, Peter said, “Teacher, the people are crowding you and pressing against you.”
LUK.8.46	 Jesus said, “Someone touched me. I know power has gone out of me.”
LUK.8.47	 The woman saw that she couldn’t hide. Trembling, she quickly bowed in front of him. There, in front of all the people, she told why she touched him and how she was cured at once.
LUK.8.48	 Jesus told her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace!”
LUK.8.49	 While Jesus was still speaking to her, someone came from the synagogue leader’s home. He said, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”
LUK.8.50	 When Jesus heard this, he told the synagogue leader, “Don’t be afraid! Just believe, and she will get well.”
LUK.8.51	 Jesus went into the house. He allowed no one to go with him except Peter, John, James, and the child’s parents. 
LUK.8.52	 Everyone was crying and showing how sad they were. Jesus said, “Don’t cry! She’s not dead. She’s just sleeping.”
LUK.8.53	 They laughed at him because they knew she was dead. 
LUK.8.54	 But Jesus took her hand and called out, “Child, get up!” 
LUK.8.55	 She came back to life and got up at once. He ordered her parents to give her something to eat. 
LUK.8.56	 They were amazed. Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
LUK.9.1	 Jesus called the twelve apostles together and gave them power and authority over every demon and power and authority to cure diseases. 
LUK.9.2	 He sent them to spread the message about the kingdom of God and to cure the sick.
LUK.9.3	 He told them, “Don’t take anything along on the trip. Don’t take a walking stick, traveling bag, any food, money, or a change of clothes. 
LUK.9.4	 When you go into a home, stay there until you’re ready to leave. 
LUK.9.5	 If people don’t welcome you, leave that city, and shake its dust off your feet as a warning to them.”
LUK.9.6	 The apostles went from village to village, told the Good News, and cured the sick everywhere.
LUK.9.7	 Herod the ruler heard about everything that was happening. He didn’t know what to make of it. Some people were saying that John had come back to life. 
LUK.9.8	 Others said that Elijah had appeared, and still others said that one of the prophets from long ago had come back to life.
LUK.9.9	 Herod said, “I had John’s head cut off. Who is this person I’m hearing so much about?” So Herod wanted to see Jesus.
LUK.9.10	 The apostles came back and told Jesus everything they had done. He took them with him to a city called Bethsaida so that they could be alone. 
LUK.9.11	 But the crowds found out about this and followed him. He welcomed them, talked to them about the kingdom of God, and cured those who were sick.
LUK.9.12	 Toward the end of the day, the twelve apostles came to him. They said to him, “Send the crowd to the closest villages and farms so that they can find some food and a place to stay. No one lives around here.”
LUK.9.13	 Jesus replied, “You give them something to eat.”
LUK.9.13	They said to him, “We have five loaves of bread and two fish. Unless we go to buy food for all these people, that’s all we have.” 
LUK.9.14	 (There were about five thousand men.)
LUK.9.14	Then he told his disciples, “Have them sit in groups of about fifty.” 
LUK.9.15	 So they did this.
LUK.9.16	 Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and blessed the food. He broke the loaves apart and kept giving them to the disciples to give to the crowd. 
LUK.9.17	 All of them ate as much as they wanted. When they picked up the leftover pieces, they filled twelve baskets.
LUK.9.18	 Once when Jesus was praying privately and his disciples were with him, he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”
LUK.9.19	 They answered, “Some say you are John the Baptizer, others Elijah, and still others say that one of the prophets from long ago has come back to life.”
LUK.9.20	 He asked them, “But who do you say I am?”
LUK.9.20	Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, whom God has sent.”
LUK.9.21	 He ordered them not to tell this to anyone.
LUK.9.22	 Jesus said that the Son of Man would have to suffer a lot. He would be rejected by the leaders, the chief priests, and the experts in Moses’ Teachings. He would be killed, but on the third day he would come back to life.
LUK.9.23	 He said to all of them, “Those who want to come with me must say no to the things they want, pick up their crosses every day, and follow me. 
LUK.9.24	 Those who want to save their lives will lose them. But those who lose their lives for me will save them. 
LUK.9.25	 What good does it do for people to win the whole world but lose their lives by destroying them? 
LUK.9.26	 If people are ashamed of me and what I say, the Son of Man will be ashamed of those people when he comes in the glory that he shares with the Father and the holy angels.
LUK.9.27	 “I can guarantee this truth: Some people who are standing here will not die until they see the kingdom of God.”
LUK.9.28	 About eight days after he had said this, Jesus took Peter, John, and James with him and went up a mountain to pray. 
LUK.9.29	 While Jesus was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. 
LUK.9.30	 Suddenly, both Moses and Elijah were talking with him. 
LUK.9.31	 They appeared in heavenly glory and were discussing Jesus’ approaching death and what he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.
LUK.9.32	 Peter and the men with him were sleeping soundly. When they woke up, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with him. 
LUK.9.33	 As Moses and Elijah were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Teacher, it’s good that we’re here. Let’s put up three tents—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter didn’t know what he was saying.
LUK.9.34	 While he was saying this, a cloud overshadowed them. They were frightened as they went into the cloud. 
LUK.9.35	 A voice came out of the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to him!”
LUK.9.36	 After the voice had spoken, they saw that Jesus was alone. The disciples said nothing, and for some time they told no one about what they had seen.
LUK.9.37	 The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus. 
LUK.9.38	 A man in the crowd shouted, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son. He’s my only child. 
LUK.9.39	 Whenever a spirit takes control of him, he shrieks, goes into convulsions, and foams at the mouth. After a struggle, the spirit goes away, leaving the child worn out. 
LUK.9.40	 I begged your disciples to force the spirit out of him, but they couldn’t do it.”
LUK.9.41	 Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and corrupt generation! How long must I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!”
LUK.9.42	 While he was coming ⌊to Jesus⌋, the demon knocked the boy to the ground and threw him into convulsions.
LUK.9.42	Jesus ordered the evil spirit to leave. He cured the boy and gave him back to his father. 
LUK.9.43	 Everyone was amazed to see God’s wonderful power.
LUK.9.43	Everyone was amazed at all the things that Jesus was doing. So he said to his disciples, 
LUK.9.44	 “Listen carefully to what I say. The Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to people.”
LUK.9.45	 They didn’t know what he meant. The meaning was hidden from them so that they didn’t understand it. Besides, they were afraid to ask him about what he had said.
LUK.9.46	 A discussion started among them about who would be the greatest. 
LUK.9.47	 Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he took a little child and had him stand beside him. 
LUK.9.48	 Then he said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me. Whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. The one who is least among all of you is the one who is greatest.”
LUK.9.49	 John replied, “Master, we saw someone forcing demons out of a person by using the power and authority of your name. We tried to stop him because he was not one of us.”
LUK.9.50	 Jesus said to him, “Don’t stop him! Whoever isn’t against you is for you.”
LUK.9.51	 The time was coming closer for Jesus to be taken to heaven. So he was determined to go to Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.52	 He sent messengers ahead of him. They went into a Samaritan village to arrange a place for him to stay. 
LUK.9.53	 But the people didn’t welcome him, because he was on his way to Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.54	 James and John, his disciples, saw this. They asked, “Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to burn them up?”
LUK.9.55	 But he turned and corrected them.
LUK.9.56	 So they went to another village.
LUK.9.57	 As they were walking along the road, a man said to Jesus, “I’ll follow you wherever you go.”
LUK.9.58	 Jesus told him, “Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to sleep.”
LUK.9.59	 He told another man, “Follow me!”
LUK.9.59	But the man said, “Sir, first let me go to bury my father.”
LUK.9.60	 But Jesus told him, “Let the dead bury their own dead. You must go everywhere and tell about the kingdom of God.”
LUK.9.61	 Another said, “I’ll follow you, sir, but first let me tell my family goodbye.”
LUK.9.62	 Jesus said to him, “Whoever starts to plow and looks back is not fit for the kingdom of God.”
LUK.10.1	 After this, the Lord appointed 70 
LUK.10.2	 He told them, “The harvest is large, but the workers are few. So ask the Lord who gives this harvest to send workers to harvest his crops. 
LUK.10.3	 Go! I’m sending you out like lambs among wolves. 
LUK.10.4	 Don’t carry a wallet, a traveling bag, or sandals, and don’t stop to greet anyone on the way. 
LUK.10.5	 Whenever you go into a house, greet the family right away with the words, ‘May there be peace in this house.’ 
LUK.10.6	 If a peaceful person lives there, your greeting will be accepted. But if that’s not the case, your greeting will be rejected. 
LUK.10.7	 Stay with the family that accepts you. Eat and drink whatever they offer you. After all, the worker deserves his pay. Do not move around from one house to another. 
LUK.10.8	 Whenever you go into a city and the people welcome you, eat whatever they serve you. 
LUK.10.9	 Heal the sick that are there, and tell the people, ‘The kingdom of God is near you!’
LUK.10.10	 “But whenever you go into a city and people don’t welcome you, leave. Announce in its streets, 
LUK.10.11	 ‘We are wiping your city’s dust from our feet in protest against you! But realize that the kingdom of God is near you!’ 
LUK.10.12	 I can guarantee that judgment day will be easier for Sodom than for that city.
LUK.10.13	 “How horrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How horrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles worked in your cities had been worked in Tyre and Sidon, they would have changed the way they thought and acted. Long ago they would have worn sackcloth and sat in ashes. 
LUK.10.14	 Judgment day will be better for Tyre and Sidon than for you. 
LUK.10.15	 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to heaven? No, you will go to hell!
LUK.10.16	 “The person who hears you hears me, and the person who rejects you rejects me. The person who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.”
LUK.10.17	 The 70 disciples came back very happy. They said, “Lord, even demons obey us when we use the power and authority of your name!”
LUK.10.18	 Jesus said to them, “I watched Satan fall from heaven like lightning. 
LUK.10.19	 I have given you the authority to trample snakes and scorpions and to destroy the enemy’s power. Nothing will hurt you. 
LUK.10.20	 However, don’t be happy that evil spirits obey you. Be happy that your names are written in heaven.”
LUK.10.21	 In that hour the Holy Spirit filled Jesus with joy. Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from wise and intelligent people and revealing them to little children. Yes, Father, this is what pleased you.
LUK.10.22	 “My Father has turned everything over to me. Only the Father knows who the Son is. And no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.”
LUK.10.23	 He turned to his disciples in private and said to them, “How blessed you are to see what you’ve seen. 
LUK.10.24	 I can guarantee that many prophets and kings wanted to see and hear what you’ve seen and heard, but they didn’t.”
LUK.10.25	 Then an expert in Moses’ Teachings stood up to test Jesus. He asked, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
LUK.10.26	 Jesus answered him, “What is written in Moses’ Teachings? What do you read there?”
LUK.10.27	 He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind. And love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ ”
LUK.10.28	 Jesus told him, “You’re right! Do this, and life will be yours.”
LUK.10.29	 But the man wanted to justify his question. So he asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?”
LUK.10.30	 Jesus replied, “A man went from Jerusalem to Jericho. On the way robbers stripped him, beat him, and left him for dead.
LUK.10.31	 “By chance, a priest was traveling along that road. When he saw the man, he went around him and continued on his way. 
LUK.10.32	 Then a Levite came to that place. When he saw the man, he, too, went around him and continued on his way.
LUK.10.33	 “But a Samaritan, as he was traveling along, came across the man. When the Samaritan saw him, he felt sorry for the man, 
LUK.10.34	 went to him, and cleaned and bandaged his wounds. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 
LUK.10.35	 The next day the Samaritan took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. He told the innkeeper, ‘Take care of him. If you spend more than that, I’ll pay you on my return trip.’
LUK.10.36	 “Of these three men, who do you think was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by robbers?”
LUK.10.37	 The expert said, “The one who was kind enough to help him.”
LUK.10.37	Jesus told him, “Go and imitate his example!”
LUK.10.38	 As they were traveling along, Jesus went into a village. A woman named Martha welcomed him into her home. 
LUK.10.39	 She had a sister named Mary. Mary sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to him talk.
LUK.10.40	 But Martha was upset about all the work she had to do. So she asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work all by myself? Tell her to help me.”
LUK.10.41	 The Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha! You worry and fuss about a lot of things. 
LUK.10.42	 There’s only one thing you need.
LUK.11.1	 Once Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he stopped praying, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray as John taught his disciples.”
LUK.11.2	 Jesus told them, “When you pray, say this:
LUK.11.2	Father,
LUK.11.2	let your name be kept holy.
LUK.11.2	Let your kingdom come.
LUK.11.3	 Give us our bread day by day.
LUK.11.4	 Forgive us as we forgive everyone else.
LUK.11.4	Don’t allow us to be tempted.”
LUK.11.5	 Jesus said to his disciples, “Suppose one of you has a friend. Suppose you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, let me borrow three loaves of bread. 
LUK.11.6	 A friend of mine on a trip has dropped in on me, and I don’t have anything to serve him.’ 
LUK.11.7	 Your friend might answer you from inside his house, ‘Don’t bother me! The door is already locked, and my children are in bed. I can’t get up to give you anything.’ 
LUK.11.8	 I can guarantee that although he doesn’t want to get up to give you anything, he will get up and give you whatever you need because he is your friend and because you were so bold.
LUK.11.9	 “So I tell you to ask, and you will receive. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened for you. 
LUK.11.10	 Everyone who asks will receive. The one who searches will find, and for the person who knocks, the door will be opened.
LUK.11.11	 “If your child asks you, his father, for a fish, would you give him a snake instead? 
LUK.11.12	 Or if your child asks you for an egg, would you give him a scorpion? 
LUK.11.13	 Even though you’re evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. So how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”
LUK.11.14	 Jesus was forcing a demon out of a man. The demon had made the man unable to talk. When the demon had gone out, the man began to talk.
LUK.11.14	The people were amazed. 
LUK.11.15	 But some of them said, “He can force demons out of people only with the help of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons.” 
LUK.11.16	 Others wanted to test Jesus and demanded that he show them some miraculous sign from heaven.
LUK.11.17	 Since Jesus knew what they were thinking, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is ruined. A house divided against itself falls. 
LUK.11.18	 Now, if Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? I say this because you say Beelzebul helps me force demons out of people. 
LUK.11.19	 If I force demons out with the help of Beelzebul, who helps your followers force them out? That’s why they will be your judges. 
LUK.11.20	 But if I force out demons with the help of God’s power, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
LUK.11.21	 “When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own mansion, his property is safe. 
LUK.11.22	 But a stronger man than he may attack him and defeat him. Then the stronger man will take away all the weapons in which the strong man trusted and will divide the loot.
LUK.11.23	 “Whoever isn’t with me is against me. Whoever doesn’t gather with me scatters.
LUK.11.24	 “When an evil spirit comes out of a person, it goes through dry places looking for a place to rest. But it doesn’t find any. Then it says, ‘I’ll go back to the home I left.’ 
LUK.11.25	 When it comes, it finds the house swept clean and in order. 
LUK.11.26	 Then the spirit goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and take up permanent residence there. In the end the condition of that person is worse than it was before.”
LUK.11.27	 While Jesus was speaking, a woman in the crowd shouted, “How blessed is the mother who gave birth to you and the breasts that nursed you.”
LUK.11.28	 Jesus replied, “Rather, how blessed are those who hear and obey God’s word.”
LUK.11.29	 As the people were gathering around him, Jesus said, “The people living today are evil. They look for a miraculous sign. But the only sign they will get is the sign of Jonah. 
LUK.11.30	 Just as Jonah became a miraculous sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a miraculous sign to the people living today. 
LUK.11.31	 The queen from the south will stand up at the time of judgment with the men who live today. She will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon’s wisdom. But look, someone greater than Solomon is here! 
LUK.11.32	 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the time of judgment with the people living today. Since the men of Nineveh turned to God and changed the way they thought and acted when Jonah spoke his message, they will condemn the people living today. But look, someone greater than Jonah is here!
LUK.11.33	 “No one lights a lamp and hides it or puts it under a basket. Instead, everyone who lights a lamp puts it on a lamp stand so that those who come in will see its light.
LUK.11.34	 “Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is unclouded, your whole body is full of light. But when your eye is evil, your body is full of darkness. 
LUK.11.35	 So be careful that the light in you isn’t darkness. 
LUK.11.36	 If your whole body is full of light and not darkness, it will be as bright as a lamp shining on you.”
LUK.11.37	 After Jesus spoke, a Pharisee invited him to have lunch at his house. So Jesus accepted the invitation. 
LUK.11.38	 The Pharisee was surprised to see that Jesus didn’t wash before the meal.
LUK.11.39	 The Lord said to him, “You Pharisees clean the outside of cups and dishes. But inside you are full of greed and evil. 
LUK.11.40	 You fools! Didn’t the one who made the outside make the inside too? 
LUK.11.41	 Give what is inside as a gift to the poor, and then everything will be clean 
LUK.11.42	 “How horrible it will be for you Pharisees! You give ⌊God⌋ one-tenth of your mint, spices, and every garden herb. But you have ignored justice and the love of God. You should have done these things without ignoring the others.
LUK.11.43	 “How horrible it will be for you Pharisees! You love to sit in the front seats in the synagogues and to be greeted in the marketplaces. 
LUK.11.44	 How horrible it will be for you! You are like unmarked graves. People walk on them without knowing what they are.”
LUK.11.45	 One of the experts in Moses’ Teachings said to him, “Teacher, when you talk this way, you insult us too.”
LUK.11.46	 Jesus said, “How horrible it will be for you experts in Moses’ Teachings! You burden people with loads that are hard to carry. But you won’t lift a finger to carry any of these loads.
LUK.11.47	 “How horrible it will be for you! You build the monuments for the prophets. But it was your ancestors who murdered them. 
LUK.11.48	 So you are witnesses and approve of what your ancestors did. They murdered the prophets for whom you build monuments. 
LUK.11.49	 That’s why the Wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles. They will murder some of those prophets and apostles and persecute others.’ 
LUK.11.50	 So the people living now will be charged with the murder of every prophet since the world was made. 
LUK.11.51	 This includes the murders from Abel to Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the temple. Yes, I can guarantee this truth: The people living today will be held responsible for this.
LUK.11.52	 “How horrible it will be for you experts in Moses’ Teachings! You have taken away the key that unlocks knowledge. You haven’t gained entrance into ⌊knowledge⌋ yourselves, and you’ve kept out those who wanted to enter.”
LUK.11.53	 When Jesus left, the experts in Moses’ Teachings and the Pharisees held a terrible grudge against him. They questioned him about many things 
LUK.11.54	 and watched him closely to trap him in something he might say.
LUK.12.1	 Meanwhile, thousands of people had gathered. They were so crowded that they stepped on each other. Jesus spoke to his disciples and said, “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees. I’m talking about their hypocrisy. 
LUK.12.2	 Nothing has been covered that will not be exposed. Whatever is secret will be made known. 
LUK.12.3	 Whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight. Whatever you have whispered in private rooms will be shouted from the housetops.
LUK.12.4	 “My friends, I can guarantee that you don’t need to be afraid of those who kill the body. After that they can’t do anything more. 
LUK.12.5	 I’ll show you the one you should be afraid of. Be afraid of the one who has the power to throw you into hell after killing you. I’m warning you to be afraid of him.
LUK.12.6	 “Aren’t five sparrows sold for two cents? God doesn’t forget any of them. 
LUK.12.7	 Even every hair on your head has been counted. Don’t be afraid! You are worth more than many sparrows. 
LUK.12.8	 I can guarantee that the Son of Man will acknowledge in front of God’s angels every person who acknowledges him in front of others. 
LUK.12.9	 But God’s angels will be told that I don’t know those people who tell others that they don’t know me. 
LUK.12.10	 Everyone who says something against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But the person who dishonors the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
LUK.12.11	 “When you are put on trial in synagogues or in front of rulers and authorities, don’t worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say. 
LUK.12.12	 At that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you must say.”
LUK.12.13	 Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to give me my share of the inheritance that our father left us.”
LUK.12.14	 Jesus said to him, “Who appointed me to be your judge or to divide ⌊your inheritance⌋?”
LUK.12.15	 He told the people, “Be careful to guard yourselves from every kind of greed. Life is not about having a lot of material possessions.”
LUK.12.16	 Then he used this illustration. He said, “A rich man had land that produced good crops. 
LUK.12.17	 He thought, ‘What should I do? I don’t have enough room to store my crops.’ 
LUK.12.18	 He said, ‘I know what I’ll do. I’ll tear down my barns and build bigger ones so that I can store all my grain and goods in them. 
LUK.12.19	 Then I’ll say to myself, “You’ve stored up a lot of good things for years to come. Take life easy, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.” ’
LUK.12.20	 “But God said to him, ‘You fool! I will demand your life from you tonight! Now who will get what you’ve accumulated?’ 
LUK.12.21	 That’s how it is when a person has material riches but is not rich in his relationship with God.”
LUK.12.22	 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “So I tell you to stop worrying about what you will eat or wear. 
LUK.12.23	 Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothes. 
LUK.12.24	 Consider the crows. They don’t plant or harvest. They don’t even have a storeroom or a barn. Yet, God feeds them. You are worth much more than birds.
LUK.12.25	 “Can any of you add an hour to your life by worrying? 
LUK.12.26	 If you can’t do a small thing like that, why worry about other things? 
LUK.12.27	 Consider how the flowers grow. They never work or spin yarn for clothes. But I say that not even Solomon in all his majesty was dressed like one of these flowers. 
LUK.12.28	 That’s the way God clothes the grass in the field. Today it’s alive, and tomorrow it’s thrown into an incinerator. So how much more will he clothe you people who have so little faith?
LUK.12.29	 “Don’t concern yourself about what you will eat or drink, and quit worrying about these things. 
LUK.12.30	 Everyone in the world is concerned about these things, but your Father knows you need them. 
LUK.12.31	 Rather, be concerned about his kingdom. Then these things will be provided for you. 
LUK.12.32	 Don’t be afraid, little flock. Your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.
LUK.12.33	 “Sell your material possessions, and give the money to the poor. Make yourselves wallets that don’t wear out! Make a treasure for yourselves in heaven that never loses its value! In heaven thieves and moths can’t get close enough to destroy your treasure. 
LUK.12.34	 Your heart will be where your treasure is.
LUK.12.35	 “Be ready for action, and have your lamps burning. 
LUK.12.36	 Be like servants waiting to open the door at their master’s knock when he returns from a wedding. 
LUK.12.37	 Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. I can guarantee this truth: He will change his clothes, make them sit down at the table, and serve them. 
LUK.12.38	 They will be blessed if he comes in the middle of the night or toward morning and finds them awake.
LUK.12.39	 “Of course, you realize that if the homeowner had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let him break into his house. 
LUK.12.40	 Be ready, because the Son of Man will return when you least expect him.”
LUK.12.41	 Peter asked, “Lord, did you use this illustration just for us or for everyone?”
LUK.12.42	 The Lord asked, “Who, then, is the faithful, skilled manager that the master will put in charge of giving the other servants their share of food at the right time? 
LUK.12.43	 That servant will be blessed if his master finds him doing this job when he comes. 
LUK.12.44	 I can guarantee this truth: He will put that servant in charge of all his property. 
LUK.12.45	 On the other hand, that servant may think that his master is taking a long time to come home. The servant may begin to beat the other servants and to eat, drink, and get drunk. 
LUK.12.46	 His master will return at an unexpected time. Then his master will punish him severely and assign him a place with unfaithful people.
LUK.12.47	 “The servant who knew what his master wanted but didn’t get ready to do it will receive a hard beating. 
LUK.12.48	 But the servant who didn’t know ⌊what his master wanted⌋ and did things for which he deserved punishment will receive a light beating. A lot will be expected from everyone who has been given a lot. More will be demanded from everyone who has been entrusted with a lot.
LUK.12.49	 “I have come to throw fire on the earth. I wish that it had already started! 
LUK.12.50	 I have a baptism to go through, and I will suffer until it is over.
LUK.12.51	 “Do you think I came to bring peace to earth? No! I can guarantee that I came to bring nothing but division. 
LUK.12.52	 From now on a family of five will be divided. Three will be divided against two and two against three. 
LUK.12.53	 A father will be against his son and a son against his father. A mother will be against her daughter and a daughter against her mother. A mother-in-law will be against her daughter-in-law and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”
LUK.12.54	 Jesus said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud coming up in the west, you immediately say, ‘There’s going to be a rainstorm,’ and it happens. 
LUK.12.55	 When you see a south wind blowing, you say, ‘It’s going to be hot,’ and that’s what happens. 
LUK.12.56	 You hypocrites! You can forecast the weather by judging the appearance of earth and sky. But for some reason you don’t know how to judge the time in which you’re living. 
LUK.12.57	 So why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right? 
LUK.12.58	 For instance, when an opponent brings you to court in front of a ruler, do your best to settle with him before you get there. Otherwise, he will drag you in front of a judge. The judge will hand you over to an officer who will throw you into prison. 
LUK.12.59	 I can guarantee that you won’t get out until you pay every penny of your fine.”
LUK.13.1	 At that time some people reported to Jesus about some Galileans whom Pilate had executed while they were sacrificing animals. 
LUK.13.2	 Jesus replied to them, “Do you think that this happened to them because they were more sinful than other people from Galilee? 
LUK.13.3	 No! I can guarantee that they weren’t. But if you don’t turn to God and change the way you think and act, then you, too, will all die. 
LUK.13.4	 What about those 18 people who died when the tower at Siloam fell on them? Do you think that they were more sinful than other people living in Jerusalem? 
LUK.13.5	 No! I can guarantee that they weren’t. But if you don’t turn to God and change the way you think and act, then you, too, will all die.”
LUK.13.6	 Then Jesus used this illustration: “A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard. He went to look for fruit on the tree but didn’t find any. 
LUK.13.7	 He said to the gardener, ‘For the last three years I’ve come to look for figs on this fig tree but haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up ⌊good⌋ soil?’
LUK.13.8	 “The gardener replied, ‘Sir, let it stand for one more year. I’ll dig around it and fertilize it. 
LUK.13.9	 Maybe next year it’ll have figs. But if not, then cut it down.’ ”
LUK.13.10	 Jesus was teaching in a synagogue on the day of worship. 
LUK.13.11	 A woman who was possessed by a spirit was there. The spirit had disabled her for 18 years. She was hunched over and couldn’t stand up straight. 
LUK.13.12	 When Jesus saw her, he called her to come to him and said, “Woman, you are free from your disability.” 
LUK.13.13	 He placed his hands on her, and she immediately stood up straight and praised God.
LUK.13.14	 The synagogue leader was irritated with Jesus for healing on the day of worship. The leader told the crowd, “There are six days when work can be done. So come on one of those days to be healed. Don’t come on the day of worship.”
LUK.13.15	 The Lord said, “You hypocrites! Don’t each of you free your ox or donkey on the day of worship? Don’t you then take it out of its stall to give it some water to drink? 
LUK.13.16	 Now, here is a descendant of Abraham. Satan has kept her in this condition for 18 years. Isn’t it right to free her on the day of worship?”
LUK.13.17	 As he said this, everyone who opposed him felt ashamed. But the entire crowd was happy about the miraculous things he was doing.
LUK.13.18	 Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? What can I compare it to? 
LUK.13.19	 It’s like a mustard seed that someone planted in a garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds nested in its branches.”
LUK.13.20	 He asked again, “What can I compare the kingdom of God to? 
LUK.13.21	 It’s like yeast that a woman mixed into a large amount of flour until the yeast worked its way through all the dough.”
LUK.13.22	 Then Jesus traveled and taught in one city and village after another on his way to Jerusalem.
LUK.13.23	 Someone asked him, “Sir, are only a few people going to be saved?”
LUK.13.23	He answered, 
LUK.13.24	 “Try hard to enter through the narrow door. I can guarantee that many will try to enter, but they won’t succeed. 
LUK.13.25	 After the homeowner gets up and closes the door, ⌊it’s too late⌋. You can stand outside, knock at the door, and say, ‘Sir, open the door for us!’ But he will answer you, ‘I don’t know who you are.’ 
LUK.13.26	 Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’ 
LUK.13.27	 But he will tell you, ‘I don’t know who you are. Get away from me, all you evil people.’ 
LUK.13.28	 Then you will cry and be in extreme pain. That’s what you’ll do when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets. They’ll be in the kingdom of God, but you’ll be thrown out. 
LUK.13.29	 People will come from all over the world and will eat in the kingdom of God. 
LUK.13.30	 Some who are last will be first, and some who are first will be last.”
LUK.13.31	 At that time some Pharisees told Jesus, “Get out of here, and go somewhere else! Herod wants to kill you.”
LUK.13.32	 Jesus said to them, “Tell that fox that I will force demons out of people and heal people today and tomorrow. I will finish my work on the third day. 
LUK.13.33	 But I must be on my way today, tomorrow, and the next day. It’s not possible for a prophet to die outside Jerusalem.
LUK.13.34	 “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you kill the prophets and stone to death those sent to you! How often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings! But you were not willing! 
LUK.13.35	 Your house will be abandoned. I can guarantee that you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’ ”
LUK.14.1	 On a day of worship Jesus went to eat at the home of a prominent Pharisee. The guests were watching Jesus very closely.
LUK.14.2	 A man whose body was swollen with fluid was there. 
LUK.14.3	 Jesus reacted by asking the Pharisees and the experts in Moses’ Teachings, “Is it right to heal on the day of worship or not?” 
LUK.14.4	 But they didn’t say a thing.
LUK.14.4	So Jesus took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away. 
LUK.14.5	 Jesus asked them, “If your son or your ox falls into a well on a day of worship, wouldn’t you pull him out immediately?” 
LUK.14.6	 They couldn’t argue with him about this.
LUK.14.7	 Then Jesus noticed how the guests always chose the places of honor. So he used this illustration when he spoke to them: 
LUK.14.8	 “When someone invites you to a wedding, don’t take the place of honor. Maybe someone more important than you was invited. 
LUK.14.9	 Then your host would say to you, ‘Give this person your place.’ Embarrassed, you would have to take the place of least honor. 
LUK.14.10	 So when you’re invited, take the place of least honor. Then, when your host comes, he will tell you, ‘Friend, move to a more honorable place.’ Then all the other guests will see how you are honored. 
LUK.14.11	 Those who honor themselves will be humbled, but people who humble themselves will be honored.”
LUK.14.12	 Then he told the man who had invited him, “When you invite people for lunch or dinner, don’t invite only your friends, family, other relatives, or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they will return the favor. 
LUK.14.13	 Instead, when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the handicapped, the lame, and the blind. 
LUK.14.14	 Then you will be blessed because they don’t have any way to pay you back. You will be paid back when those who have God’s approval come back to life.”
LUK.14.15	 One of those eating with him heard this. So he said to Jesus, “The person who will be at the banquet in the kingdom of God is blessed.”
LUK.14.16	 Jesus said to him, “A man gave a large banquet and invited many people. 
LUK.14.17	 When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who were invited, ‘Come! Everything is ready now.’
LUK.14.18	 “Everyone asked to be excused. The first said to him, ‘I bought a field, and I need to see it. Please excuse me.’ 
LUK.14.19	 Another said, ‘I bought five pairs of oxen, and I’m on my way to see how well they plow. Please excuse me.’ 
LUK.14.20	 Still another said, ‘I recently got married, and that’s why I can’t come.’
LUK.14.21	 “The servant went back to report this to his master. Then the master of the house became angry. He told his servant, ‘Run to every street and alley in the city! Bring back the poor, the handicapped, the blind, and the lame.’
LUK.14.22	 “The servant said, ‘Sir, what you’ve ordered has been done. But there is still room for more people.’
LUK.14.23	 “Then the master told his servant, ‘Go to the roads and paths! Urge the people to come to my house. I want it to be full. 
LUK.14.24	 I can guarantee that none of those invited earlier will taste any food at my banquet.’ ”
LUK.14.25	 Large crowds were traveling with Jesus. He turned to them and said, 
LUK.14.26	 “If people come to me and are not ready to abandon their fathers, mothers, wives, children, brothers, and sisters, as well as their own lives, they cannot be my disciples. 
LUK.14.27	 So those who do not carry their crosses and follow me cannot be my disciples.
LUK.14.28	 “Suppose you want to build a tower. You would first sit down and figure out what it costs. Then you would see if you have enough money to finish it. 
LUK.14.29	 Otherwise, if you lay a foundation and can’t finish the building, everyone who watches will make fun of you. 
LUK.14.30	 They’ll say, ‘This person started to build but couldn’t finish the job.’
LUK.14.31	 “Or suppose a king is going to war against another king. He would first sit down and think things through. Can he and his 10,000 soldiers fight against a king with 20,000 soldiers? 
LUK.14.32	 If he can’t, he’ll send ambassadors to ask for terms of peace while the other king is still far away. 
LUK.14.33	 In the same way, none of you can be my disciples unless you give up everything.
LUK.14.34	 “Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste, how will you restore its flavor? 
LUK.14.35	 It’s not any good for the ground or for the manure pile. People throw it away.
LUK.14.35	“Let the person who has ears listen!”
LUK.15.1	 All the tax collectors and sinners came to listen to Jesus. 
LUK.15.2	 But the Pharisees and the experts in Moses’ Teachings complained, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”
LUK.15.3	 Jesus spoke to them using this illustration: 
LUK.15.4	 “Suppose a man has 100 sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the 99 sheep grazing in the pasture and look for the lost sheep until he finds it? 
LUK.15.5	 When he finds it, he’s happy. He puts that sheep on his shoulders and 
LUK.15.6	 goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says to them, ‘Let’s celebrate! I’ve found my lost sheep!’ 
LUK.15.7	 I can guarantee that there will be more happiness in heaven over one person who turns to God and changes the way he thinks and acts than over 99 people who already have turned to God and have his approval.”
LUK.15.8	 “Suppose a woman has ten coins and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house, and look for the coin carefully until she finds it? 
LUK.15.9	 When she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Let’s celebrate! I’ve found the coin that I lost.’ 
LUK.15.10	 So I can guarantee that God’s angels are happy about one person who turns to God and changes the way he thinks and acts.”
LUK.15.11	 Then Jesus said, “A man had two sons. 
LUK.15.12	 The younger son said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the property.’ So the father divided his property between his two sons.
LUK.15.13	 “After a few days, the younger son gathered his possessions and left for a country far away from home. There he wasted everything he had on a wild lifestyle. 
LUK.15.14	 He had nothing left when a severe famine spread throughout that country. He had nothing to live on. 
LUK.15.15	 So he got a job from someone in that country and was sent to feed pigs in the fields. 
LUK.15.16	 No one in the country would give him any food, and he was so hungry that he would have eaten what the pigs were eating.
LUK.15.17	 “Finally, he came to his senses. He said, ‘How many of my father’s hired men have more food than they can eat, while I’m starving to death here? 
LUK.15.18	 I’ll go at once to my father, and I’ll say to him, “Father, I’ve sinned against heaven and you. 
LUK.15.19	 I don’t deserve to be called your son anymore. Make me one of your hired men.” ’
LUK.15.20	 “So he went at once to his father. While he was still at a distance, his father saw him and felt sorry for him. He ran to his son, put his arms around him, and kissed him. 
LUK.15.21	 Then his son said to him, ‘Father, I’ve sinned against heaven and you. I don’t deserve to be called your son anymore.’ 
LUK.15.22	 “The father said to his servants, ‘Hurry! Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. 
LUK.15.23	 Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let’s celebrate with a feast. 
LUK.15.24	 My son was dead and has come back to life. He was lost but has been found.’ Then they began to celebrate.
LUK.15.25	 “His older son was in the field. As he was coming back to the house, he heard music and dancing. 
LUK.15.26	 He called to one of the servants and asked what was happening.
LUK.15.27	 “The servant told him, ‘Your brother has come home. So your father has killed the fattened calf to celebrate your brother’s safe return.’
LUK.15.28	 “Then the older son became angry and wouldn’t go into the house. His father came out and begged him to come in. 
LUK.15.29	 But he answered his father, ‘All these years I’ve worked like a slave for you. I’ve never disobeyed one of your commands. Yet, you’ve never given me so much as a little goat for a celebration with my friends. 
LUK.15.30	 But this son of yours spent your money on prostitutes, and when he came home, you killed the fattened calf for him.’
LUK.15.31	 “His father said to him, ‘My child, you’re always with me. Everything I have is yours. 
LUK.15.32	 But we have something to celebrate, something to be happy about. This brother of yours was dead but has come back to life. He was lost but has been found.’ ”
LUK.16.1	 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “A rich man had a business manager. The manager was accused of wasting the rich man’s property. 
LUK.16.2	 So the rich man called for his manager and said to him, ‘What’s this I hear about you? Let me examine your books. It’s obvious that you can’t manage my property any longer.’
LUK.16.3	 “The manager thought, ‘What should I do? My master is taking my job away from me. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg. 
LUK.16.4	 I know what I’ll do so that people will welcome me into their homes when I’ve lost my job.’
LUK.16.5	 “So the manager called for each one of his master’s debtors. He said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’
LUK.16.6	 “The debtor replied, ‘Eight hundred gallons of olive oil.’
LUK.16.6	“The manager told him, ‘Take my master’s ledger. Quick! Sit down, and write “four hundred!” ’
LUK.16.7	 “Then he asked another debtor, ‘How much do you owe?’
LUK.16.7	“The debtor replied, ‘A thousand bushels of wheat.’
LUK.16.7	“The manager told him, ‘Take the ledger, and write “eight hundred!” ’
LUK.16.8	 “The master praised the dishonest manager for being so clever. Worldly people are more clever than spiritually-minded people when it comes to dealing with others.”
LUK.16.9	 ⌊Jesus continued,⌋ “I’m telling you that although wealth is often used in dishonest ways, you should use it to make friends for yourselves. When life is over, you will be welcomed into an eternal home. 
LUK.16.10	 Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with a lot. Whoever is dishonest with very little is dishonest with a lot. 
LUK.16.11	 Therefore, if you can’t be trusted with wealth that is often used dishonestly, who will trust you with wealth that is real? 
LUK.16.12	 If you can’t be trusted with someone else’s wealth, who will give you your own?
LUK.16.13	 “A servant cannot serve two masters. He will hate the first master and love the second, or he will be devoted to the first and despise the second. You cannot serve God and wealth.”
LUK.16.14	 The Pharisees, who love money, heard all this and were making sarcastic remarks about him. 
LUK.16.15	 So Jesus said to them, “You try to justify your actions in front of people. But God knows what’s in your hearts. What is important to humans is disgusting to God.
LUK.16.16	 “Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets were ⌊in force⌋ until the time of John. Since that time, people have been telling the Good News about the kingdom of God, and everyone is trying to force their way into it. 
LUK.16.17	 It is easier for the earth and the heavens to disappear than to drop a comma from the Scriptures.
LUK.16.18	 “Any man who divorces his wife to marry another woman is committing adultery. The man who marries a woman divorced in this way is committing adultery.
LUK.16.19	 “There was a rich man who wore expensive clothes. Every day was like a party to him. 
LUK.16.20	 There was also a beggar named Lazarus who was regularly brought to the gate of the rich man’s house. 
LUK.16.21	 Lazarus would have eaten any scraps that fell from the rich man’s table. Laz arus was covered with sores,
LUK.16.22	 “One day the beggar died, and the angels carried him to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. 
LUK.16.23	 He went to hell, where he was constantly tortured. As he looked up, in the distance he saw Abraham and Lazarus. 
LUK.16.24	 He yelled, ‘Father Abraham! Have mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water to cool off my tongue. I am suffering in this fire.’
LUK.16.25	 “Abraham replied, ‘Remember, my child, that you had a life filled with good times, while Lazarus’ life was filled with misery. Now he has peace here, while you suffer. 
LUK.16.26	 Besides, a wide area separates us. People couldn’t cross it in either direction even if they wanted to.’
LUK.16.27	 “The rich man responded, ‘Then I ask you, Father, to send Lazarus back to my father’s home. 
LUK.16.28	 I have five brothers. He can warn them so that they won’t end up in this place of torture.’
LUK.16.29	 “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses’ ⌊Teachings⌋ and the Prophets. Your brothers should listen to them!’
LUK.16.30	 “The rich man replied, ‘No, Father Abraham! If someone comes back to them from the dead, they will turn to God and change the way they think and act.’
LUK.16.31	 “Abraham answered him, ‘If they won’t listen to Moses’ ⌊Teachings⌋ and the Prophets, they won’t be persuaded even if someone comes back to life.’ ”
LUK.17.1	 Jesus told his disciples, “Situations that cause people to lose their faith are certain to arise. But how horrible it will be for the person who causes someone to lose his faith! 
LUK.17.2	 It would be best for that person to be thrown into the sea with a large stone hung around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to lose his faith. 
LUK.17.3	 So watch yourselves!
LUK.17.3	“If a believer sins, correct him. If he changes the way he thinks and acts, forgive him. 
LUK.17.4	 Even if he wrongs you seven times in one day and comes back to you seven times and says that he is sorry, forgive him.”
LUK.17.5	 Then the apostles said to the Lord, “Give us more faith.”
LUK.17.6	 The Lord said, “If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Pull yourself up by the roots, and plant yourself in the sea!’ and it would obey you.
LUK.17.7	 “Suppose someone has a servant who is plowing fields or watching sheep. Does he tell his servant when he comes from the field, ‘Have something to eat’? 
LUK.17.8	 No. Instead, he tells his servant, ‘Get dinner ready for me! After you serve me my dinner, you can eat yours.’ 
LUK.17.9	 He doesn’t thank the servant for following orders. 
LUK.17.10	 That’s the way it is with you. When you’ve done everything you’re ordered to do, say, ‘We’re worthless servants. We’ve only done our duty.’ ”
LUK.17.11	 Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee on his way to Jerusalem. 
LUK.17.12	 As he went into a village, ten men with a skin disease met him. They stood at a distance 
LUK.17.13	 and shouted, “Jesus, Teacher, have mercy on us!”
LUK.17.14	 When he saw them, he told them, “Show yourselves to the priests.” As they went, they were made clean.
LUK.17.15	 When one of them saw that he was healed, he turned back and praised God in a loud voice. 
LUK.17.16	 He quickly bowed at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. (The man was a Samaritan.)
LUK.17.17	 Jesus asked, “Weren’t ten men made clean? Where are the other nine? 
LUK.17.18	 Only this foreigner came back to praise God.”
LUK.17.19	 Jesus told the man, “Get up, and go home! Your faith has made you well.”
LUK.17.20	 The Pharisees asked Jesus when the kingdom of God would come.
LUK.17.20	He answered them, “People can’t observe the coming of the kingdom of God. 
LUK.17.21	 They can’t say, ‘Here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’ You see, the kingdom of God is within 
LUK.17.22	 Jesus said to his disciples, “The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. 
LUK.17.23	 People will say, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Don’t run after those people. 
LUK.17.24	 The day of the Son of Man 
LUK.17.25	 But first he must suffer a lot and be rejected by the people of his day.
LUK.17.26	 “When the Son of Man comes again, the situation will be like the time of Noah. 
LUK.17.27	 People were eating, drinking, and getting married until the day that Noah went into the ship. Then the flood destroyed all of them.
LUK.17.28	 “The situation will also be like the time of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. 
LUK.17.29	 But on the day that Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from the sky and destroyed all of them. 
LUK.17.30	 The day when the Son of Man is revealed will be like that.
LUK.17.31	 “On that day those who are on the roof shouldn’t come down to get their belongings out of their houses. Those who are in the field shouldn’t turn back. 
LUK.17.32	 Remember Lot’s wife! 
LUK.17.33	 Those who try to save their lives will lose them, and those who lose their lives will save them.
LUK.17.34	 “I can guarantee that on that night if two people are in one bed, one will be taken and the other one will be left. 
LUK.17.35	 Two women will be grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other one will be left.” 
LUK.17.37	 They asked him, “Where, Lord?”
LUK.17.37	Jesus told them, “Vultures will gather wherever there is a dead body.”
LUK.18.1	 Jesus used this illustration with his disciples to show them that they need to pray all the time and never give up. 
LUK.18.2	 He said, “In a city there was a judge who didn’t fear God or respect people. 
LUK.18.3	 In that city there was also a widow who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice.’
LUK.18.4	 “For a while the judge refused to do anything. But then he thought, ‘This widow really annoys me. Although I don’t fear God or respect people, 
LUK.18.5	 I’ll have to give her justice. Otherwise, she’ll keep coming to me until she wears me out.’ ”
LUK.18.6	 The Lord added, “Pay attention to what the dishonest judge thought. 
LUK.18.7	 Won’t God give his chosen people justice when they cry out to him for help day and night? Is he slow to help them? 
LUK.18.8	 I can guarantee that he will give them justice quickly. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”
LUK.18.9	 Jesus also used this illustration with some who were sure that God approved of them while they looked down on everyone else. 
LUK.18.10	 He said, “Two men went into the temple courtyard to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. 
LUK.18.11	 The Pharisee stood up and prayed, ‘God, I thank you that I’m not like other people! I’m not a robber or a dishonest person. I haven’t committed adultery. I’m not even like this tax collector. 
LUK.18.12	 I fast twice a week, and I give you a tenth of my entire income.’
LUK.18.13	 “But the tax collector was standing at a distance. He wouldn’t even look up to heaven. Instead, he became very upset, and he said, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’
LUK.18.14	 “I can guarantee that this tax collector went home with God’s approval, but the Pharisee didn’t. Everyone who honors himself will be humbled, but the person who humbles himself will be honored.”
LUK.18.15	 Some people brought infants to Jesus to have him hold them. When the disciples saw this, they told the people not to do that.
LUK.18.16	 But Jesus called the infants to him and said, “Don’t stop the children from coming to me! Children like these are part of the kingdom of God. 
LUK.18.17	 I can guarantee this truth: Whoever doesn’t receive the kingdom of God as a little child receives it will never enter it.”
LUK.18.18	 An official asked Jesus, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
LUK.18.19	 Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God. 
LUK.18.20	 You know the commandments: Never commit adultery. Never murder. Never steal. Never give false testimony. Honor your father and your mother.”
LUK.18.21	 The official replied, “I’ve obeyed all these commandments since I was a boy.”
LUK.18.22	 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still need one thing. Sell everything you have. Distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then follow me!”
LUK.18.23	 When the official heard this, he became sad, because he was very rich. 
LUK.18.24	 Jesus watched him and said, “How hard it is for rich people to enter the kingdom of God! 
LUK.18.25	 Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”
LUK.18.26	 Those who heard him asked, “Who, then, can be saved?”
LUK.18.27	 Jesus said, “The things that are impossible for people to do are possible for God to do.”
LUK.18.28	 Then Peter said, “We’ve left everything to follow you.”
LUK.18.29	 Jesus said to them, “I can guarantee this truth: Anyone who gave up his home, wife, brothers, parents, or children because of the kingdom of God 
LUK.18.30	 will certainly receive many times as much in this life and will receive eternal life in the world to come.”
LUK.18.31	 Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and said to them, “We’re going to Jerusalem. Everything that the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will come true. 
LUK.18.32	 He will be handed over to foreigners. They will make fun of him, insult him, spit on him, 
LUK.18.33	 whip him, and kill him. But on the third day he will come back to life.”
LUK.18.34	 But they didn’t understand any of this. What he said was a mystery to them, and they didn’t know what he meant.
LUK.18.35	 As Jesus came near Jericho, a blind man was sitting and begging by the road. 
LUK.18.36	 When he heard the crowd going by, he tried to find out what was happening. 
LUK.18.37	 The people told him that Jesus from Nazareth was passing by. 
LUK.18.38	 Then the blind man shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
LUK.18.39	 The people at the front of the crowd told the blind man to be quiet. But he shouted even louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
LUK.18.40	 Jesus stopped and ordered them to bring the man to him. When the man came near, Jesus asked him, 
LUK.18.41	 “What do you want me to do for you?”
LUK.18.41	The blind man said, “Lord, I want to see again.”
LUK.18.42	 Jesus told him, “Receive your sight! Your faith has made you well.” 
LUK.18.43	 Immediately, he could see again. He followed Jesus and praised God. All the people saw this, and they, too, praised God.
LUK.19.1	 Jesus was passing through Jericho. 
LUK.19.2	 A man named Zacchaeus was there. He was the director of tax collectors, and he was rich. 
LUK.19.3	 He tried to see who Jesus was. But Zacchaeus was a small man, and he couldn’t see Jesus because of the crowd. 
LUK.19.4	 So Zacchaeus ran ahead and climbed a fig tree to see Jesus, who was coming that way.
LUK.19.5	 When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up and said, “Zacchaeus, come down! I must stay at your house today.”
LUK.19.6	 Zacchaeus came down and was glad to welcome Jesus into his home. 
LUK.19.7	 But the people who saw this began to express disapproval. They said, “He went to be the guest of a sinner.”
LUK.19.8	 ⌊Later, at dinner,⌋ Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Lord, I’ll give half of my property to the poor. I’ll pay four times as much as I owe to those I have cheated in any way.”
LUK.19.9	 Then Jesus said to Zacchaeus, “You and your family have been saved today. You’ve shown that you, too, are one of Abraham’s descendants. 
LUK.19.10	 Indeed, the Son of Man has come to seek and to save people who are lost.”
LUK.19.11	 Jesus was getting closer to Jerusalem, and the people thought that the kingdom of God would appear suddenly. While Jesus had the people’s attention, he used this illustration. 
LUK.19.12	 He said, “A prince went to a distant country to be appointed king, and then he returned. 
LUK.19.13	 ⌊Before he left,⌋ he called ten of his servants and gave them ten coins. He said to his servants, ‘Invest this money until I come back.’
LUK.19.14	 “The citizens of his own country hated him. They sent representatives to follow him and say ⌊to the person who was going to appoint him⌋, ‘We don’t want this man to be our king.’
LUK.19.15	 “After he was appointed king, he came back. Then he said, ‘Call those servants to whom I gave money. I want to know how much each one has made by investing.’
LUK.19.16	 “The first servant said, ‘Sir, the coin you gave me has earned ten times as much.’
LUK.19.17	 “The king said to him, ‘Good job! You’re a good servant. You proved that you could be trusted with a little money. Take charge of ten cities.’
LUK.19.18	 “The second servant said, ‘The coin you gave me, sir, has made five times as much.’
LUK.19.19	 “The king said to this servant, ‘You take charge of five cities.’
LUK.19.20	 “Then the other servant said, ‘Sir, look! Here’s your coin. I’ve kept it in a cloth for safekeeping because 
LUK.19.21	 I was afraid of you. You’re a tough person to get along with. You take what isn’t yours and harvest grain you haven’t planted.’
LUK.19.22	 “The king said to him, ‘I’ll judge you by what you’ve said, you evil servant! You knew that I was a tough person to get along with. You knew that I take what isn’t mine and harvest grain I haven’t planted. 
LUK.19.23	 Then why didn’t you put my money in the bank? When I came back, I could have collected it with interest.’ 
LUK.19.24	 The king told his men, ‘Take his coin away, and give it to the man who has ten.’
LUK.19.25	 “They replied, ‘Sir, he already has ten coins.’
LUK.19.26	 “‘I can guarantee that everyone who has something will be given more. But everything will be taken away from those who don’t have much. 
LUK.19.27	 Bring my enemies, who didn’t want me to be their king. Kill them in front of me.’ ”
LUK.19.28	 After Jesus had given this illustration, he continued on his way to Jerusalem.
LUK.19.29	 When he came near Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives (as it was called), Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead of him. 
LUK.19.30	 He said to them, “Go into the village ahead of you. As you enter, you will find a young donkey tied there. No one has ever sat on it. Untie it, and bring it. 
LUK.19.31	 If anyone asks you why you are untying it, say that the Lord needs it.”
LUK.19.32	 The men Jesus sent found it as he had told them. 
LUK.19.33	 While they were untying the young donkey, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the donkey?”
LUK.19.34	 The disciples answered, “The Lord needs it.”
LUK.19.35	 They brought the donkey to Jesus, put their coats on it, and helped Jesus onto it. 
LUK.19.36	 As he was riding along, people spread their coats on the road. 
LUK.19.37	 By this time he was coming near the place where the road went down the Mount of Olives. Then the whole crowd of disciples began to praise God for all the miracles they had seen. 
LUK.19.38	 They shouted joyfully,
LUK.19.38	“Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!
LUK.19.38	Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven.”
LUK.19.39	 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell your disciples to be quiet.”
LUK.19.40	 Jesus replied, “I can guarantee that if they are quiet, the stones will cry out.”
LUK.19.41	 When he came closer and saw the city, he began to cry. 
LUK.19.42	 He said, “If you had only known today what would bring you peace! But now it is hidden, so you cannot see it. 
LUK.19.43	 The time will come when enemy armies will build a wall to surround you and close you in on every side. 
LUK.19.44	 They will level you to the ground and kill your people. One stone will not be left on top of another, because you didn’t recognize the time when God came to help you.”
LUK.19.45	 Jesus went into the temple courtyard and began to throw out those who were selling things there. 
LUK.19.46	 He said to them, “Scripture says, ‘My house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have turned it into a gathering place for thieves.”
LUK.19.47	 Jesus taught in the temple courtyard every day. The chief priests, the experts in Moses’ Teachings, and the leaders of the people looked for a way to kill him. 
LUK.19.48	 But they could not find a way to do it, because all the people were eager to hear him.
LUK.20.1	 One day Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courtyard and telling them the Good News. The chief priests, the experts in Moses’ Teachings, and the leaders came up to him. 
LUK.20.2	 They asked him, “Tell us, what gives you the right to do these things? Who told you that you could do this?”
LUK.20.3	 Jesus answered them, “I, too, have a question for you. Tell me, 
LUK.20.4	 did John’s right to baptize come from heaven or from humans?”
LUK.20.5	 They talked about this among themselves. They said, “If we say, ‘from heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ 
LUK.20.6	 But if we say, ‘from humans,’ everyone will stone us to death. They’re convinced that John was a prophet.” 
LUK.20.7	 So they answered that they didn’t know who gave John the right to baptize.
LUK.20.8	 Jesus told them, “Then I won’t tell you why I have the right to do these things.”
LUK.20.9	 Then, using this illustration, Jesus spoke to the people: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to vineyard workers, and went on a long trip.
LUK.20.10	 “At the right time he sent a servant to the workers to obtain from them a share of the grapes from the vineyard. But the workers beat the servant and sent him back with nothing. 
LUK.20.11	 So he sent a different servant. The workers beat him, treated him shamefully, and sent him back with nothing. 
LUK.20.12	 Then he sent a third servant. But they injured this one and threw him out ⌊of the vineyard⌋.
LUK.20.13	 “Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I’ll send my son, whom I love. They’ll probably respect him.’
LUK.20.14	 “When the workers saw him, they talked it over among themselves. They said, ‘This is the heir. Let’s kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.’ 
LUK.20.15	 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
LUK.20.15	“What will the owner of the vineyard do to them? 
LUK.20.16	 He will destroy these workers and give the vineyard to others.”
LUK.20.16	Those who heard him said, “That’s unthinkable!”
LUK.20.17	 Then Jesus looked straight at them and asked, “What, then, does this Scripture verse mean:
LUK.20.17	‘The stone that the builders rejected
LUK.20.17	has become the cornerstone’?
LUK.20.18	 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken. If that stone falls on anyone, it will crush that person.”
LUK.20.19	 The experts in Moses’ Teachings and the chief priests wanted to arrest him right there, but they were afraid of the people. They knew that he had directed this illustration at them.
LUK.20.20	 So they watched for an opportunity to send out some spies. The spies were to act like sincere religious people. They wanted to catch him saying the wrong thing so that they could hand him over to the governor. 
LUK.20.21	 They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you’re right in what you say and teach. Besides, you don’t play favorites. Rather, you teach the way of God truthfully. 
LUK.20.22	 Is it right for us to pay taxes to the emperor or not?”
LUK.20.23	 He saw through their scheme, so he said to them, 
LUK.20.24	 “Show me a coin. Whose face and name is this?”
LUK.20.24	They answered, “The emperor’s.”
LUK.20.25	 He said to them, “Well, then give the emperor what belongs to the emperor, and give God what belongs to God.”
LUK.20.26	 They couldn’t make him say anything wrong in front of the people. His answer surprised them, so they said no more.
LUK.20.27	 Some Sadducees, who say that people will never come back to life, came to Jesus. They asked him, 
LUK.20.28	 “Teacher, Moses wrote for us, ‘If a married man dies and has no children, his brother should marry his widow and have children for his brother.’ 
LUK.20.29	 There were seven brothers. The first got married and died without having children. 
LUK.20.30	 Then the second brother married the widow, 
LUK.20.31	 and so did the third. In the same way all seven brothers married the widow, died, and left no children. 
LUK.20.32	 Finally, the woman died. 
LUK.20.33	 Now, when the dead come back to life, whose wife will she be? The seven brothers had married her.”
LUK.20.34	 Jesus said to them, “In this world people get married. 
LUK.20.35	 But people who are considered worthy to come back to life and live in the next world will neither marry 
LUK.20.36	 nor die anymore. They are the same as the angels. They are God’s children who have come back to life.
LUK.20.37	 “Even Moses showed in the passage about the bush that the dead come back to life. He says that the Lord is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
LUK.20.38	 He’s not the God of the dead but of the living. In God’s sight all people are living.”
LUK.20.39	 Some experts in Moses’ Teachings responded, “Teacher, that was well said.” 
LUK.20.40	 From that time on, no one dared to ask him another question.
LUK.20.41	 Jesus said to them, “How can people say that the Messiah is David’s son? 
LUK.20.42	 David says in the book of Psalms,
LUK.20.42	‘The Lord said to my Lord,
LUK.20.42	“Take the highest position in heaven
LUK.20.43	 until I make your enemies your footstool.” ’
LUK.20.44	 David calls him Lord. So how can he be his son?”
LUK.20.45	 While all the people were listening, Jesus said to the disciples, 
LUK.20.46	 “Beware of the experts in Moses’ Teachings! They like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces, to have the front seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at dinners. 
LUK.20.47	 They rob widows by taking their houses and then say long prayers to make themselves look good. The experts in Moses’ Teachings will receive the most severe punishment.”
LUK.21.1	 Looking up, Jesus saw people, especially the rich, dropping their gifts into the temple offering box. 
LUK.21.2	 He noticed a poor widow drop in two small coins. 
LUK.21.3	 He said, “I can guarantee this truth: This poor widow has given more than all the others. 
LUK.21.4	 All of these people have given what they could spare. But she, in her poverty, has given everything she had to live on.”
LUK.21.5	 Some ⌊of the disciples⌋ were talking about the temple complex. They noted that it was built with fine stones and decorated with beautiful gifts. So Jesus said, 
LUK.21.6	 “About these buildings that you see—the time will come when not one of these stones will be left on top of another. Each one will be torn down.”
LUK.21.7	 The disciples asked him, “Teacher, when will this happen? What will be the sign when all this will occur?”
LUK.21.8	 Jesus said, “Be careful that you are not deceived. Many will come using my name. They will say, ‘I am he!’ and ‘The time is near.’ Don’t follow them!
LUK.21.9	 “When you hear of wars and revolutions, don’t be terrified! These things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately.”
LUK.21.10	 Then Jesus continued, “Nation will fight against nation and kingdom against kingdom. 
LUK.21.11	 There will be terrible earthquakes, famines, and dreadful diseases in various places. Terrifying sights and miraculous signs will come from the sky.
LUK.21.12	 “Before all these things happen, people will arrest and persecute you. They will hand you over to their synagogues and put you into their prisons. They will drag you in front of kings and governors because of my name. 
LUK.21.13	 It will be your opportunity to testify to them. 
LUK.21.14	 So make up your minds not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. 
LUK.21.15	 I will give you words and wisdom that none of your enemies will be able to oppose or prove wrong.
LUK.21.16	 “Even parents, brothers, relatives, and friends will betray you and kill some of you. 
LUK.21.17	 Everyone will hate you because you are committed to me. 
LUK.21.18	 But not a hair on your head will be lost. 
LUK.21.19	 By your endurance you will save your life.
LUK.21.20	 “When you see armies camped around Jerusalem, realize that the time is near for it to be destroyed. 
LUK.21.21	 Then those of you in Judea should flee to the mountains. Those of you in Jerusalem should leave it. Those of you in the fields shouldn’t go back into them. 
LUK.21.22	 This will be a time of vengeance. Everything that is written about it will come true.
LUK.21.23	 “How horrible it will be for women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days. Indeed, the land will suffer very hard times, and its people will be punished. 
LUK.21.24	 Swords will cut them down, and they will be carried off into all nations as prisoners. Nations will trample Jerusalem until the times allowed for the nations ⌊to do this⌋ are over.
LUK.21.25	 “Miraculous signs will occur in the sun, moon, and stars. The nations of the earth will be deeply troubled and confused because of the roaring and tossing of the sea. 
LUK.21.26	 People will faint as they fearfully wait for what will happen to the world. Indeed, the powers of the universe will be shaken.
LUK.21.27	 “Then people will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
LUK.21.28	 “When these things begin to happen, stand with confidence! The time when you will be set free is near.”
LUK.21.29	 Then Jesus used this story as an illustration. “Look at the fig tree or any other tree. 
LUK.21.30	 As soon as leaves grow on them, you know without being told that summer is near. 
LUK.21.31	 In the same way, when you see these things happen, you know that the kingdom of God is near.
LUK.21.32	 “I can guarantee this truth: This generation will not disappear until all this takes place. 
LUK.21.33	 The earth and the heavens will disappear, but my words will never disappear.
LUK.21.34	 “Make sure that you don’t become drunk, hung over, and worried about life. Then that day could suddenly catch you by surprise 
LUK.21.35	 like a trap that catches a bird. That day will surprise all people who live on the earth. 
LUK.21.36	 Be alert at all times. Pray so that you have the power to escape everything that is about to happen and to stand in front of the Son of Man.”
LUK.21.37	 During the day Jesus would teach in the temple courtyard. But at night he would go to the Mount of Olives (as it was called) and spend the night there. 
LUK.21.38	 All of the people would get up early to hear him speak in the temple courtyard.
LUK.22.1	 The Festival of Unleavened Bread, called Passover, was near. 
LUK.22.2	 The chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings were looking for some way to kill Jesus. However, they were afraid of the people.
LUK.22.3	 Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles. 
LUK.22.4	 Judas went to the chief priests and the temple guards and discussed with them how he could betray Jesus. 
LUK.22.5	 They were pleased and agreed to give him some money. 
LUK.22.6	 So Judas promised to do it. He kept looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them when there was no crowd.
LUK.22.7	 The day came during the Festival of Unleavened Bread when the Passover lamb had to be killed. 
LUK.22.8	 Jesus sent Peter and John and told them, “Go, prepare the Passover lamb for us to eat.”
LUK.22.9	 They asked him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”
LUK.22.10	 He told them, “Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him into the house he enters. 
LUK.22.11	 Tell the owner of the house that the teacher asks, ‘Where is the room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?’ 
LUK.22.12	 He will take you upstairs and show you a large furnished room. Get things ready there.”
LUK.22.13	 The disciples left. They found everything as Jesus had told them and prepared the Passover.
LUK.22.14	 When it was time to eat the Passover meal, Jesus and the apostles were at the table. 
LUK.22.15	 Jesus said to them, “I’ve had a deep desire to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. 
LUK.22.16	 I can guarantee that I won’t eat it again until it finds its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.” 
LUK.22.17	 Then he took a cup and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving. He said, “Take this, and share it. 
LUK.22.18	 I can guarantee that from now on I won’t drink this wine until the kingdom of God comes.”
LUK.22.19	 Then Jesus took bread and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving. He broke the bread, gave it to them, and said, “This is my body, which is given up for you. Do this to remember me.”
LUK.22.20	 When supper was over, he did the same with the cup. He said, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new promise 
LUK.22.21	 “The hand of the one who will betray me is with me on the table. 
LUK.22.22	 The Son of Man is going to die the way it has been planned for him. But how horrible it will be for that person who betrays him.”
LUK.22.23	 So they began to discuss with each other who could do such a thing.
LUK.22.24	 Then a quarrel broke out among the disciples. They argued about who should be considered the greatest.
LUK.22.25	 Jesus said to them, “The kings of nations have power over their people, and those in authority call themselves friends of the people. 
LUK.22.26	 But you’re not going to be that way! Rather, the greatest among you must be like the youngest, and your leader must be like a servant. 
LUK.22.27	 Who’s the greatest, the person who sits at the table or the servant? Isn’t it really the person who sits at the table? But I’m among you as a servant.
LUK.22.28	 “You have stood by me in the troubles that have tested me. 
LUK.22.29	 So as my Father has given me a kingdom, I’m giving it to you. 
LUK.22.30	 You will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You will also sit on thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.”
LUK.22.31	 ⌊Then the Lord said,⌋ “Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has demanded to have you apostles for himself. He wants to separate you from me as a farmer separates wheat from husks. 
LUK.22.32	 But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. So when you recover, strengthen the other disciples.”
LUK.22.33	 But Peter said to him, “Lord, I’m ready to go to prison with you and to die with you.”
LUK.22.34	 Jesus replied, “Peter, I can guarantee that the rooster won’t crow tonight until you say three times that you don’t know me.”
LUK.22.35	 Then Jesus said to them, “When I sent you out without a wallet, traveling bag, or sandals, you didn’t lack anything, did you?”
LUK.22.35	“Not a thing!” they answered.
LUK.22.36	 Then he said to them, “But now, the person who has a wallet and a traveling bag should take them along. The person who doesn’t have a sword should sell his coat and buy one. 
LUK.22.37	 I can guarantee that the Scripture passage which says, ‘He was counted with criminals,’ must find its fulfillment in me. Indeed, whatever is written about me will come true.”
LUK.22.38	 The disciples said, “Lord, look! Here are two swords!”
LUK.22.38	Then Jesus said to them, “That’s enough!”
LUK.22.39	 Jesus went out ⌊of the city⌋ to the Mount of Olives as he usually did. His disciples followed him. 
LUK.22.40	 When he arrived, he said to them, “Pray that you won’t be tempted.”
LUK.22.41	 Then he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed, 
LUK.22.42	 “Father, if it is your will, take this cup ⌊of suffering⌋ away from me. However, your will must be done, not mine.”
LUK.22.43	 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. 
LUK.22.44	 So he prayed very hard in anguish. His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.
LUK.22.45	 When Jesus ended his prayer, he got up and went to the disciples. He found them asleep and overcome with sadness. 
LUK.22.46	 He said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up, and pray that you won’t be tempted.”
LUK.22.47	 While he was still speaking to the disciples, a crowd arrived. The man called Judas, one of the twelve apostles, was leading them. He came close to Jesus to kiss him.
LUK.22.48	 Jesus said to him, “Judas, do you intend to betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”
LUK.22.49	 The men who were with Jesus saw what was going to happen. So they asked him, “Lord, should we use our swords to fight?” 
LUK.22.50	 One of the disciples cut off the right ear of the chief priest’s servant.
LUK.22.51	 But Jesus said, “Stop! That’s enough of this.” Then he touched the servant’s ear and healed him.
LUK.22.52	 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple guards, and leaders who had come for him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal? 
LUK.22.53	 I was with you in the temple courtyard every day and you didn’t try to arrest me. But this is your time, when darkness rules.”
LUK.22.54	 So they arrested Jesus and led him away to the chief priest’s house.
LUK.22.54	Peter followed at a distance.
LUK.22.55	 Some men had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard. As they sat together, Peter sat among them. 
LUK.22.56	 A female servant saw him as he sat facing the glow of the fire. She stared at him and said, “This man was with Jesus.”
LUK.22.57	 But Peter denied it by saying, “I don’t know him, woman.”
LUK.22.58	 A little later someone else saw Peter and said, “You are one of them.”
LUK.22.58	But Peter said, “Not me!”
LUK.22.59	 About an hour later another person insisted, “It’s obvious that this man was with him. He’s a Galilean!”
LUK.22.60	 But Peter said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”
LUK.22.60	Just then, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 
LUK.22.61	 Then the Lord turned and looked directly at Peter. Peter remembered what the Lord had said: “Before a rooster crows today, you will say three times that you don’t know me.” 
LUK.22.62	 Then Peter went outside and cried bitterly.
LUK.22.63	 The men who were guarding Jesus made fun of him as they beat him. 
LUK.22.64	 They blindfolded him and said to him, “Tell us who hit you.” 
LUK.22.65	 They also insulted him in many other ways.
LUK.22.66	 In the morning the council of the people’s leaders, the chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings, gathered together. They brought Jesus in front of their highest court and asked him, 
LUK.22.67	 “Tell us, are you the Messiah?”
LUK.22.67	Jesus said to them, “If I tell you, you won’t believe me. 
LUK.22.68	 And if I ask you, you won’t answer. 
LUK.22.69	 But from now on, the Son of Man will be in the highest position in heaven.”
LUK.22.70	 Then all of them said, “So you’re the Son of God?”
LUK.22.70	Jesus answered them, “You’re right to say that I am.”
LUK.22.71	 Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We’ve heard him say it ourselves.”
LUK.23.1	 Then the entire assembly stood up and took him to Pilate.
LUK.23.2	 They began to accuse Jesus by saying, “We found that he stirs up trouble among our people: He keeps them from paying taxes to the emperor, and he says that he is Christ, a king.”
LUK.23.3	 Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
LUK.23.3	“Yes, I am,” Jesus answered.
LUK.23.4	 Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, “I can’t find this man guilty of any crime.”
LUK.23.5	 The priests and the crowd became more forceful. They said, “He stirs up the people throughout Judea with his teachings. He started in Galilee and has come here.”
LUK.23.6	 When Pilate heard that, he asked if the man was from Galilee. 
LUK.23.7	 When Pilate found out that he was, he sent Jesus to Herod. Herod ruled Galilee and was in Jerusalem at that time.
LUK.23.8	 Herod was very pleased to see Jesus. For a long time he had wanted to see him. He had heard about Jesus and hoped to see him perform some kind of miracle. 
LUK.23.9	 Herod asked Jesus many questions, but Jesus wouldn’t answer him. 
LUK.23.10	 Meanwhile, the chief priests and the experts in Moses’ Teachings stood there and shouted their accusations against Jesus.
LUK.23.11	 Herod and his soldiers treated Jesus with contempt and made fun of him. They put a colorful robe on him and sent him back to Pilate. 
LUK.23.12	 So Herod and Pilate became friends that day. They had been enemies before this.
LUK.23.13	 Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people. 
LUK.23.14	 He told them, “You brought me this man as someone who turns the people against the government. I’ve questioned him in front of you and haven’t found this man guilty of the crimes of which you accuse him. 
LUK.23.15	 Neither could Herod. So he sent this man back to us. This man hasn’t done anything to deserve the death penalty. 
LUK.23.16	 So I’m going to have him whipped and set free.” 
LUK.23.18	 The whole crowd then shouted, “Take him away! Free Barabbas for us.” 
LUK.23.19	 (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for his involvement in a riot that had taken place in the city and for murder.)
LUK.23.20	 But because Pilate wanted to free Jesus, he spoke to the people again.
LUK.23.21	 They began yelling, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
LUK.23.22	 A third time Pilate spoke to them. He asked, “Why? What has he done wrong? I haven’t found this man deserving of the death penalty. So I’m going to have him whipped and set free.”
LUK.23.23	 But the crowd pressured Pilate. They shouted that Jesus had to be crucified, and they finally won. 
LUK.23.24	 Pilate decided to give in to their demand. 
LUK.23.25	 He freed Barabbas, who had been put in prison for rioting and murdering, because that’s what they wanted. But he let them do what they wanted to Jesus.
LUK.23.26	 As the soldiers led Jesus away, they grabbed a man named Simon, who was from the city of Cyrene. Simon was coming into Jerusalem. They laid the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.
LUK.23.27	 A large crowd followed Jesus. The women in the crowd cried and sang funeral songs for him. 
LUK.23.28	 Jesus turned to them and said, “You women of Jerusalem, don’t cry for me! Rather, cry for yourselves and your children! 
LUK.23.29	 The time is coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the women who couldn’t get pregnant, who couldn’t give birth, and who couldn’t nurse a child.’ 
LUK.23.30	 Then people will say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’ 
LUK.23.31	 If people do this to a green tree, what will happen to a dry one?”
LUK.23.32	 Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be executed with him.
LUK.23.33	 When they came to the place called The Skull, they crucified him. The criminals were also crucified, one on his right and the other on his left.
LUK.23.34	 Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them. They don’t know what they’re doing.” 
LUK.23.34	Meanwhile, the soldiers divided his clothes among themselves by throwing dice.
LUK.23.35	 The people stood there watching. But the rulers were making sarcastic remarks. They said, “He saved others. If he’s the Messiah that God has chosen, let him save himself!” 
LUK.23.36	 The soldiers also made fun of him. They would go up to him, offer him some vinegar, 
LUK.23.37	 and say, “If you’re the king of the Jews, save yourself!”
LUK.23.38	 A written notice was placed above him. It said, “This is the king of the Jews.”
LUK.23.39	 One of the criminals hanging there insulted Jesus by saying, “So you’re really the Messiah, are you? Well, save yourself and us!”
LUK.23.40	 But the other criminal scolded him: “Don’t you fear God at all? Can’t you see that you’re condemned in the same way that he is? 
LUK.23.41	 Our punishment is fair. We’re getting what we deserve. But this man hasn’t done anything wrong.”
LUK.23.42	 Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you enter your kingdom.”
LUK.23.43	 Jesus said to him, “I can guarantee this truth: Today you will be with me in paradise.”
LUK.23.44	 Around noon darkness came over the entire land and lasted until three in the afternoon. 
LUK.23.45	 The sun had stopped shining. The curtain in the temple was split in two.
LUK.23.46	 Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” After he said this, he died.
LUK.23.47	 When an army officer saw what had happened, he praised God and said, “Certainly, this man was innocent!” 
LUK.23.48	 Crowds had gathered to see the sight. But when all of them saw what had happened, they cried and returned to the city. 
LUK.23.49	 All his friends, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance and watched everything.
LUK.23.50	 There was a good man who had God’s approval. His name was Joseph. He was a member of the Jewish council, 
LUK.23.51	 but he had not agreed with what they had done. He was from the Jewish city of Arimathea, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.
LUK.23.52	 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
LUK.23.53	 After he took it down from the cross, he wrapped it in linen. Then he laid the body in a tomb cut in rock, a tomb in which no one had ever been buried. 
LUK.23.54	 It was Friday, and the day of worship was just beginning.
LUK.23.55	 The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed closely behind Joseph. They observed the tomb and how his body was laid in it. 
LUK.23.56	 Then they went back to the city and prepared spices and perfumes. But on the day of worship they rested according to the commandment.
LUK.24.1	 Very early on Sunday morning the women went to the tomb. They were carrying the spices that they had prepared. 
LUK.24.2	 They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb. 
LUK.24.3	 When they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 
LUK.24.4	 While they were puzzled about this, two men in clothes that were as bright as lightning suddenly stood beside them. 
LUK.24.5	 The women were terrified and bowed to the ground.
LUK.24.5	The men asked the women, “Why are you looking among the dead for the living one? 
LUK.24.6	 He’s not here. He has been brought back to life! Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee. 
LUK.24.7	 He said, ‘The Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people, be crucified, and come back to life on the third day.’” 
LUK.24.8	 Then the women remembered what Jesus had told them.
LUK.24.9	 The women left the tomb and went back to the city. They told everything to the eleven apostles and all the others. 
LUK.24.10	 The women were Mary from Magdala, Joanna, and Mary (the mother of James). There were also other women with them. They told the apostles everything.
LUK.24.11	 The apostles thought that the women’s story didn’t make any sense, and they didn’t believe them.
LUK.24.12	 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. He bent down to look inside and saw only the strips of linen. Then he went away, wondering what had happened.
LUK.24.13	 On the same day, two of Jesus’ disciples were going to a village called Emmaus. It was about seven miles from Jerusalem. 
LUK.24.14	 They were talking to each other about everything that had happened.
LUK.24.15	 While they were talking, Jesus approached them and began walking with them. 
LUK.24.16	 Although they saw him, they didn’t recognize him.
LUK.24.17	 He asked them, “What are you dis cussing?”
LUK.24.17	They stopped and looked very sad. 
LUK.24.18	 One of them, Cleopas, replied, “Are you the only one in Jerusalem who doesn’t know what has happened recently?”
LUK.24.19	 “What happened?” he asked.
LUK.24.19	They said to him, “We were discussing what happened to Jesus from Nazareth. He was a powerful prophet in what he did and said in the sight of God and all the people. 
LUK.24.20	 Our chief priests and rulers had him condemned to death and crucified. 
LUK.24.21	 We were hoping that he was the one who would free Israel. What’s more, this is now the third day since everything happened. 
LUK.24.22	 Some of the women from our group startled us. They went to the tomb early this morning 
LUK.24.23	 and didn’t find his body. They told us that they had seen angels who said that he’s alive. 
LUK.24.24	 Some of our men went to the tomb and found it empty, as the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”
LUK.24.25	 Then Jesus said to them, “How foolish you are! You’re so slow to believe everything the prophets said! 
LUK.24.26	 Didn’t the Messiah have to suffer these things and enter into his glory?” 
LUK.24.27	 Then he began with Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets to explain to them what was said about him throughout the Scriptures.
LUK.24.28	 When they came near the village where they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. 
LUK.24.29	 They urged him, “Stay with us! It’s getting late, and the day is almost over.” So he went to stay with them.
LUK.24.30	 While he was at the table with them, he took bread and blessed it. He broke the bread and gave it to them. 
LUK.24.31	 Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. But he vanished from their sight.
LUK.24.32	 They said to each other, “Weren’t we excited when he talked with us on the road and opened up the meaning of the Scriptures for us?”
LUK.24.33	 That same hour they went back to Jerusalem. They found the eleven apostles and those who were with them gathered together. 
LUK.24.34	 They were saying, “The Lord has really come back to life and has appeared to Simon.”
LUK.24.35	 Then the two disciples told what had happened on the road and how they had recognized Jesus when he broke the bread.
LUK.24.36	 While they were talking about what had happened, Jesus stood among them. He said to them, “Peace be with you!” 
LUK.24.37	 They were terrified, and thought they were seeing a ghost.
LUK.24.38	 He asked them, “Why are you afraid? Why do you have doubts? 
LUK.24.39	 Look at my hands and feet, and see that it’s really me. Touch me, and see for yourselves. Ghosts don’t have flesh and bones, but you can see that I do.” 
LUK.24.40	 As he said this, he showed them his hands and feet.
LUK.24.41	 The disciples were overcome with joy and amazement because this seemed too good to be true. Then Jesus asked them, “Do you have anything to eat?” 
LUK.24.42	 They gave him a piece of broiled fish. 
LUK.24.43	 He took it and ate it while they watched him.
LUK.24.44	 Then he said to them, “These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you. I told you that everything written about me in Moses’ Teachings, the Prophets, and the Psalms had to come true.” 
LUK.24.45	 Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures. 
LUK.24.46	 He said to them, “Scripture says that the Messiah would suffer and that he would come back to life on the third day. 
LUK.24.47	 Scripture also says that by the authority of Jesus people would be told to turn to God and change the way they think and act so that their sins will be forgiven. This would be told to people from all nations, beginning in the city of Jerusalem.
LUK.24.48	 You are witnesses to these things.
LUK.24.49	 “I’m sending you what my Father promised. Wait here in the city until you receive power from heaven.”
LUK.24.50	 Then Jesus took them to a place near Bethany. There he raised his hands and blessed them. 
LUK.24.51	 While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken to heaven.
LUK.24.52	 The disciples worshiped him and were overjoyed as they went back to Jerusalem. 
LUK.24.53	 They were always in the temple, where they praised God.
JHN.1.1	 In the beginning the Word already existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
JHN.1.2	 He was already with God in the beginning.
JHN.1.3	 Everything came into existence through him. Not one thing that exists was made without him.
JHN.1.4	 He was the source of life, and that life was the light for humanity.
JHN.1.5	 The light shines in the dark, and the dark has never extinguished it.
JHN.1.6	 God sent a man named John to be his messenger. 
JHN.1.7	 John came to declare the truth about the light so that everyone would become believers through his message. 
JHN.1.8	 John was not the light, but he came to declare the truth about the light.
JHN.1.9	 The real light, which shines on everyone, was coming into the world. 
JHN.1.10	 He was in the world, and the world came into existence through him. Yet, the world didn’t recognize him. 
JHN.1.11	 He went to his own people, and his own people didn’t accept him. 
JHN.1.12	 However, he gave the right to become God’s children to everyone who believed in him. 
JHN.1.13	 These people didn’t become God’s children in a physical way—from a human impulse or from a husband’s desire ⌊to have a child⌋. They were born from God.
JHN.1.14	 The Word became human and lived among us. We saw his glory. It was the glory that the Father shares with his only Son, a glory full of kindness 
JHN.1.15	 (John declared the truth about him when he said loudly, “This is the person about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me was before me because he existed before I did.’ ”)
JHN.1.16	 Each of us has received one gift after another because of all that the Word is. 
JHN.1.17	 Laws were given through Moses, but kindness and truth came into existence through Jesus Christ. 
JHN.1.18	 No one has ever seen God. God’s only Son, the one who is closest to the Father’s heart, has made him known.
JHN.1.19	 This was John’s answer when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” 
JHN.1.20	 John didn’t refuse to answer. He told them clearly, “I’m not the Messiah.”
JHN.1.21	 They asked him, “Well, are you Elijah?”
JHN.1.21	John answered, “No, I’m not.”
JHN.1.21	Then they asked, “Are you the prophet?”
JHN.1.21	John replied, “No.”
JHN.1.22	 So they asked him, “Who are you? Tell us so that we can take an answer back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
JHN.1.23	 John said, “I’m a voice crying out in the desert, ‘Make the way for the Lord straight,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”
JHN.1.24	 Some of those who had been sent were Pharisees. 
JHN.1.25	 They asked John, “Why do you baptize if you’re not the Messiah or Elijah or the prophet?”
JHN.1.26	 John answered them, “I baptize with water. Someone you don’t know is standing among you. 
JHN.1.27	 He’s the one who comes after me. I am not worthy to untie his sandal strap.”
JHN.1.28	 This happened in Bethany on the east side of the Jordan River, where John was baptizing.
JHN.1.29	 John saw Jesus coming toward him the next day and said, “Look! This is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. 
JHN.1.30	 He is the one I spoke about when I said, ‘A man who comes after me was before me because he existed before I did.’ 
JHN.1.31	 I didn’t know who he was. However, I came to baptize with water to show him to the people of Israel.”
JHN.1.32	 John said, “I saw the Spirit come down as a dove from heaven and stay on him. 
JHN.1.33	 I didn’t know who he was. But God, who sent me to baptize with water, had told me, ‘When you see the Spirit come down and stay on someone, you’ll know that person is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ 
JHN.1.34	 I have seen this and have declared that this is the Son of God.”
JHN.1.35	 The next day John was standing with two of his disciples. 
JHN.1.36	 John saw Jesus walk by. John said, “Look! This is the Lamb of God.” 
JHN.1.37	 When the two disciples heard John say this, they followed Jesus.
JHN.1.38	 Jesus turned around and saw them following him. He asked them, “What are you looking for?”
JHN.1.38	They said to him, “Rabbi” (which means “teacher”), “where are you staying?”
JHN.1.39	 Jesus told them, “Come, and you will see.” So they went to see where he was staying and spent the rest of that day with him. It was about ten o’clock in the morning.
JHN.1.40	 Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two disciples who heard John and followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.41	 Andrew at once found his brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means “Christ”). 
JHN.1.42	 Andrew brought Simon to Jesus.
JHN.1.42	Jesus looked at Simon and said, “You are Simon, son of John. Your name will be Cephas” (which means “Peter”).
JHN.1.43	 The next day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee. He found Philip and told him, “Follow me!” 
JHN.1.44	 (Philip was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter.)
JHN.1.45	 Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the man whom Moses wrote about in his teachings and whom the prophets wrote about. He is Jesus, son of Joseph, from the city of Nazareth.”
JHN.1.46	 Nathanael said to Philip, “Can anything good come from Nazareth?”
JHN.1.46	Philip told him, “Come and see!”
JHN.1.47	 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and remarked, “Here is a true Israelite who is sincere.”
JHN.1.48	 Nathanael asked Jesus, “How do you know anything about me?”
JHN.1.48	Jesus answered him, “I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.”
JHN.1.49	 Nathanael said to Jesus, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the king of Israel!”
JHN.1.50	 Jesus replied, “You believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that.” 
JHN.1.51	 Jesus said to Nathanael, “I can guarantee this truth: You will see the sky open and God’s angels going up and coming down to the Son of Man.”
JHN.2.1	 Three days later a wedding took place in the city of Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there. 
JHN.2.2	 Jesus and his disciples had been invited too.
JHN.2.3	 When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They’re out of wine.”
JHN.2.4	 Jesus said to her, “Why did you come to me? My time has not yet come.”
JHN.2.5	 His mother told the servers, “Do whatever he tells you.”
JHN.2.6	 Six stone water jars were there. They were used for Jewish purification rituals. Each jar held 18 to 27 gallons.
JHN.2.7	 Jesus told the servers, “Fill the jars with water.” The servers filled the jars to the brim. 
JHN.2.8	 Jesus said to them, “Pour some, and take it to the person in charge.” The servers did as they were told.
JHN.2.9	 The person in charge tasted the water that had become wine. He didn’t know where it had come from, although the servers who had poured the water knew. The person in charge called the groom 
JHN.2.10	 and said to him, “Everyone serves the best wine first. When people are drunk, the host serves cheap wine. But you have saved the best wine for now.”
JHN.2.11	 Cana in Galilee was the place where Jesus began to perform miracles. He made his glory public there, and his disciples believed in him.
JHN.2.12	 After this, Jesus, his mother, brothers, and disciples went to the city of Capernaum and stayed there for a few days.
JHN.2.13	 The Jewish Passover was near, so Jesus went to Jerusalem. 
JHN.2.14	 He found those who were selling cattle, sheep, and pigeons in the temple courtyard. He also found moneychangers sitting there. 
JHN.2.15	 He made a whip from small ropes and threw everyone with their sheep and cattle out of the temple courtyard. He dumped the moneychangers’ coins and knocked over their tables.
JHN.2.16	 He told those who sold pigeons, “Pick up this stuff, and get it out of here! Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!”
JHN.2.17	 His disciples remembered that Scripture said, “Devotion for your house will consume me.”
JHN.2.18	 The Jews reacted by asking Jesus, “What miracle can you show us to justify what you’re doing?”
JHN.2.19	 Jesus replied, “Tear down this temple, and I’ll rebuild it in three days.”
JHN.2.20	 The Jews said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple. Do you really think you’re going to rebuild it in three days?”
JHN.2.21	 But the temple Jesus spoke about was his own body. 
JHN.2.22	 After he came back to life, his disciples remembered that he had said this. So they believed the Scripture and this statement that Jesus had made.
JHN.2.23	 While Jesus was in Jerusalem at the Passover festival, many people believed in him because they saw the miracles that he performed. 
JHN.2.24	 Jesus, however, was wary of these believers. He understood people 
JHN.2.25	 and didn’t need anyone to tell him about human nature. He knew what people were really like.
JHN.3.1	 Nicodemus was a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish council. 
JHN.3.2	 He came to Jesus one night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that God has sent you as a teacher. No one can perform the miracles you perform unless God is with him.”
JHN.3.3	 Jesus replied to Nicodemus, “I can guarantee this truth: No one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.” 
JHN.3.4	 Nicodemus asked him, “How can anyone be born when he’s an old man? He can’t go back inside his mother a second time to be born, can he?”
JHN.3.5	 Jesus answered Nicodemus, “I can guarantee this truth: No one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit. 
JHN.3.6	 Flesh and blood give birth to flesh and blood, but the Spirit gives birth to things that are spiritual. 
JHN.3.7	 Don’t be surprised when I tell you that all of you must be born from above. 
JHN.3.8	 The wind 
JHN.3.9	 Nicodemus replied, “How can that be?”
JHN.3.10	 Jesus told Nicodemus, “You’re a well-known teacher of Israel. Can’t you understand this? 
JHN.3.11	 I can guarantee this truth: We know what we’re talking about, and we confirm what we’ve seen. Yet, you don’t accept our message. 
JHN.3.12	 If you don’t believe me when I tell you about things on earth, how will you believe me when I tell you about things in heaven? 
JHN.3.13	 No one has gone to heaven except the Son of Man, who came from heaven.
JHN.3.14	 “As Moses lifted up the snake ⌊on a pole⌋ in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up. 
JHN.3.15	 Then everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.”
JHN.3.16	 God loved the world this way: He gave his only Son so that everyone who believes in him will not die but will have eternal life. 
JHN.3.17	 God sent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but to save the world. 
JHN.3.18	 Those who believe in him won’t be condemned. But those who don’t believe are already condemned because they don’t believe in God’s only Son.
JHN.3.19	 This is why people are condemned: The light came into the world. Yet, people loved the dark rather than the light because their actions were evil. 
JHN.3.20	 People who do what is wrong hate the light and don’t come to the light. They don’t want their actions to be exposed. 
JHN.3.21	 But people who do what is true come to the light so that the things they do for God may be clearly seen.
JHN.3.22	 Later, Jesus and his disciples went to the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them and baptized people. 
JHN.3.23	 John was baptizing in Aenon, near Salim. Water was plentiful there. (People came to John to be baptized, 
JHN.3.24	 since John had not yet been put in prison.)
JHN.3.25	 Some of John’s disciples had an argument with a Jew about purification ceremonies. 
JHN.3.26	 So they went to John and asked him, “Rabbi, do you remember the man you spoke so favorably about when he was with you on the other side of the Jordan River? Well, he’s baptizing, and everyone is going to him!”
JHN.3.27	 John answered, “People can’t receive anything unless it has been given to them from heaven. 
JHN.3.28	 You are witnesses that I said, ‘I’m not the Messiah, but I’ve been sent ahead of him.’
JHN.3.29	 “The groom is the person to whom the bride belongs. The best man, who stands and listens to him, is overjoyed when the groom speaks. This is the joy that I feel. 
JHN.3.30	 He must increase in importance, while I must decrease in importance.
JHN.3.31	 “The person who comes from above is superior to everyone. I, a person from the earth, know nothing but what is on earth, and that’s all I can talk about. The person who comes from heaven is superior to everyone 
JHN.3.32	 and tells what he has seen and heard. Yet, no one accepts what he says. 
JHN.3.33	 I have accepted what that person said, and I have affirmed that God is truthful. 
JHN.3.34	 The man whom God has sent speaks God’s message. After all, God gives him the Spirit without limit. 
JHN.3.35	 The Father loves his Son and has put everything in his power. 
JHN.3.36	 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life. Instead, he will see God’s constant anger.”
JHN.4.1	 Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John. 
JHN.4.2	 (Actually, Jesus was not baptizing people. His disciples were.) 
JHN.4.3	 So he left the Judean countryside and went back to Galilee.
JHN.4.4	 Jesus had to go through Samaria. 
JHN.4.5	 He arrived at a city in Samaria called Sychar. Sychar was near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 
JHN.4.6	 Jacob’s Well was there. Jesus sat down by the well because he was tired from traveling. The time was about six o’clock in the evening.
JHN.4.7	 A Samaritan woman went to get some water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink of water.” 
JHN.4.8	 (His disciples had gone into the city to buy some food.)
JHN.4.9	 The Samaritan woman asked him, “How can a Jewish man like you ask a Samaritan woman like me for a drink of water?” (Jews, of course, don’t associate with Samaritans.)
JHN.4.10	 Jesus replied to her, “If you only knew what God’s gift is and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked him for a drink. He would have given you living water.”
JHN.4.11	 The woman said to him, “Sir, you don’t have anything to use to get water, and the well is deep. So where are you going to get this living water? 
JHN.4.12	 You’re not more important than our ancestor Jacob, are you? He gave us this well. He and his sons and his animals drank water from it.”
JHN.4.13	 Jesus answered her, “Everyone who drinks this water will become thirsty again. 
JHN.4.14	 But those who drink the water that I will give them will never become thirsty again. In fact, the water I will give them will become in them a spring that gushes up to eternal life.”
JHN.4.15	 The woman told Jesus, “Sir, give me this water! Then I won’t get thirsty or have to come here to get water.”
JHN.4.16	 Jesus told her, “Go to your husband, and bring him here.”
JHN.4.17	 The woman replied, “I don’t have a husband.”
JHN.4.17	Jesus told her, “You’re right when you say that you don’t have a husband. 
JHN.4.18	 You’ve had five husbands, and the man you have now isn’t your husband. You’ve told the truth.”
JHN.4.19	 The woman said to Jesus, “I see that you’re a prophet! 
JHN.4.20	 Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain. But you Jews say that people must worship in Jerusalem.”
JHN.4.21	 Jesus told her, “Believe me. A time is coming when you Samaritans won’t be worshiping the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem. 
JHN.4.22	 You don’t know what you’re worshiping. We ⌊Jews⌋ know what we’re worshiping, because salvation comes from the Jews. 
JHN.4.23	 Indeed, the time is coming, and it is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. The Father is looking for people like that to worship him. 
JHN.4.24	 God is a spirit. Those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”
JHN.4.25	 The woman said to him, “I know that the Messiah is coming. When he comes, he will tell us everything.” (
JHN.4.26	 Jesus told her, “I am he, and I am speaking to you now.”
JHN.4.27	 At that time his disciples returned. They were surprised that he was talking to a woman. But none of them asked him, “What do you want from her?” or “Why are you talking to her?”
JHN.4.28	 Then the woman left her water jar and went back into the city. She told the people, 
JHN.4.29	 “Come with me, and meet a man who told me everything I’ve ever done. Could he be the Messiah?” 
JHN.4.30	 The people left the city and went to meet Jesus.
JHN.4.31	 Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, have something to eat.”
JHN.4.32	 Jesus told them, “I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”
JHN.4.33	 The disciples asked each other, “Did someone bring him something to eat?”
JHN.4.34	 Jesus told them, “My food is to do what the one who sent me wants me to do and to finish the work he has given me.
JHN.4.35	 “Don’t you say, ‘In four more months the harvest will be here’? I’m telling you to look and see that the fields are ready to be harvested. 
JHN.4.36	 The person who harvests the crop is already getting paid. He is gathering grain for eternal life. So the person who plants the grain and the person who harvests it are happy together. 
JHN.4.37	 In this respect the saying is true: ‘One person plants, and another person harvests.’ 
JHN.4.38	 I have sent you to harvest a crop you have not worked for. Other people have done the hard work, and you have followed them in their work.”
JHN.4.39	 Many Samaritans in that city believed in Jesus because of the woman who said, “He told me everything I’ve ever done.” 
JHN.4.40	 So when the Samaritans went to Jesus, they asked him to stay with them. He stayed in Samaria for two days. 
JHN.4.41	 Many more Samaritans believed because of what Jesus said. 
JHN.4.42	 They told the woman, “Our faith is no longer based on what you’ve said. We have heard him ourselves, and we know that he really is the savior of the world.”
JHN.4.43	 After spending two days in Samaria, Jesus left for Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	 Jesus had said that a prophet is not honored in his own country. 
JHN.4.45	 But when Jesus arrived in Galilee, the people of Galilee welcomed him. They had seen everything he had done at the festival in Jerusalem, since they, too, had attended the festival.
JHN.4.46	 Jesus returned to the city of Cana in Galilee, where he had changed water into wine. A government official was in Cana. His son was sick in Capernaum. 
JHN.4.47	 The official heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee. So he went to Jesus and asked him to go to Capernaum with him to heal his son who was about to die.
JHN.4.48	 Jesus told the official, “If people don’t see miracles and amazing things, they won’t believe.”
JHN.4.49	 The official said to him, “Sir, come with me before my little boy dies.”
JHN.4.50	 Jesus told him, “Go home. Your son will live.” The man believed what Jesus told him and left.
JHN.4.51	 While the official was on his way to Capernaum, his servants met him and told him that his boy was alive. 
JHN.4.52	 The official asked them at what time his son got better. His servants told him, “The fever left him yesterday evening at seven o’clock.” 
JHN.4.53	 Then the boy’s father realized that it was the same time that Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” So the official and his entire family became believers.
JHN.4.54	 This was the second miracle that Jesus performed after he had come back from Judea to Galilee.
JHN.5.1	 Later, Jesus went to Jerusalem for a Jewish festival.
JHN.5.2	 Near Sheep Gate in Jerusalem was a pool called 
JHN.5.3	 Under these porches a large number of sick people—people who were blind, lame, or paralyzed—used to lie.
JHN.5.5	 One man, who had been sick for 38 years, was lying there. 
JHN.5.6	 Jesus saw the man lying there and knew that he had been sick for a long time. So Jesus asked the man, “Would you like to get well?”
JHN.5.7	 The sick man answered Jesus, “Sir, I don’t have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I’m trying to get there, someone else steps into the pool ahead of me.”
JHN.5.8	 Jesus told the man, “Get up, pick up your cot, and walk.” 
JHN.5.9	 The man immediately became well, picked up his cot, and walked.
JHN.5.9	That happened on a day of worship. 
JHN.5.10	 So the Jews told the man who had been healed, “This is a day of worship. You’re not allowed to carry your cot today.”
JHN.5.11	 The man replied, “The man who made me well told me to pick up my cot and walk.”
JHN.5.12	 The Jews asked him, “Who is the man who told you to pick it up and walk?” 
JHN.5.13	 But the man who had been healed didn’t know who Jesus was. (Jesus had withdrawn from the crowd.)
JHN.5.14	 Later, Jesus met the man in the temple courtyard and told him, “You’re well now. Stop sinning so that something worse doesn’t happen to you.”
JHN.5.15	 The man went back to the Jews and told them that Jesus was the man who had made him well.
JHN.5.16	 The Jews began to persecute Jesus because he kept healing people on the day of worship. 
JHN.5.17	 Jesus replied to them, “My Father is working right now, and so am I.”
JHN.5.18	 His reply made the Jews more intent on killing him. Not only did he break the laws about the day of worship, but also he made himself equal to God when he said repeatedly that God was his Father.
JHN.5.19	 Jesus said to the Jews, “I can guarantee this truth: The Son cannot do anything on his own. He can do only what he sees the Father doing. Indeed, the Son does exactly what the Father does. 
JHN.5.20	 The Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. The Father will show him even greater things to do than these things so that you will be amazed. 
JHN.5.21	 In the same way that the Father brings back the dead and gives them life, the Son gives life to anyone he chooses.
JHN.5.22	 “The Father doesn’t judge anyone. He has entrusted judgment entirely to the Son 
JHN.5.23	 so that everyone will honor the Son as they honor the Father. Whoever doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him. 
JHN.5.24	 I can guarantee this truth: Those who listen to what I say and believe in the one who sent me will have eternal life. They won’t be judged because they have already passed from death to life.
JHN.5.25	 “I can guarantee this truth: A time is coming (and is now here) when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who respond to it will live. 
JHN.5.26	 The Father is the source of life, and he has enabled the Son to be the source of life too.
JHN.5.27	 “He has also given the Son authority to pass judgment because he is the Son of Man.
JHN.5.28	 Don’t be surprised at what I’ve just said. A time is coming when all the dead will hear his voice, 
JHN.5.29	 and they will come out of their tombs. Those who have done good will come back to life and live. But those who have done evil will come back to life and will be judged. 
JHN.5.30	 I can’t do anything on my own. As I listen ⌊to the Father⌋, I make my judgments. My judgments are right because I don’t try to do what I want but what the one who sent me wants.
JHN.5.31	 “If I testify on my own behalf, what I say isn’t true. 
JHN.5.32	 Someone else testifies on my behalf, and I know that what he says about me is true. 
JHN.5.33	 You sent people to John ⌊the Baptizer⌋, and he testified to the truth. 
JHN.5.34	 But I don’t depend on human testimony. I’m telling you this to save you. 
JHN.5.35	 John was a lamp that gave off brilliant light. For a time you enjoyed the pleasure of his light. 
JHN.5.36	 But I have something that testifies more favorably on my behalf than John’s testimony. The tasks that the Father gave me to carry out, these tasks which I perform, testify on my behalf. They prove that the Father has sent me. 
JHN.5.37	 The Father who sent me testifies on my behalf. You have never heard his voice, and you have never seen his form. 
JHN.5.38	 So you don’t have the Father’s message within you, because you don’t believe in the person he has sent. 
JHN.5.39	 You study the Scriptures in detail because you think you have the source of eternal life in them. These Scriptures testify on my behalf. 
JHN.5.40	 Yet, you don’t want to come to me to get ⌊eternal⌋ life.
JHN.5.41	 “I don’t accept praise from humans. 
JHN.5.42	 But I know what kind of people you are. You don’t have any love for God. 
JHN.5.43	 I have come with the authority my Father has given me, but you don’t accept me. If someone else comes with his own authority, you will accept him. 
JHN.5.44	 How can you believe when you accept each other’s praise and don’t look for the praise that comes from the only God?
JHN.5.45	 “Don’t think that I will accuse you in the presence of the Father. Moses, the one you trust, is already accusing you. 
JHN.5.46	 If you really believed Moses, you would believe me. Moses wrote about me. 
JHN.5.47	 If you don’t believe what Moses wrote, how will you ever believe what I say?”
JHN.6.1	 Jesus later crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or the Sea of Tiberias). 
JHN.6.2	 A large crowd followed him because they saw the miracles that he performed for the sick. 
JHN.6.3	 Jesus went up a mountain and sat with his disciples. 
JHN.6.4	 The time for the Jewish Passover festival was near.
JHN.6.5	 As Jesus saw a large crowd coming to him, he said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?” 
JHN.6.6	 Jesus asked this question to test him. He already knew what he was going to do.
JHN.6.7	 Philip answered, “We would need about a year’s wages to buy enough bread for each of them to have a piece.”
JHN.6.8	 One of Jesus’ disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter’s brother, told him, 
JHN.6.9	 “A boy who has five loaves of barley bread and two small fish is here. But they won’t go very far for so many people.”
JHN.6.10	 Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.”
JHN.6.10	The people had plenty of grass to sit on. (There were about 5,000 men in the crowd.)
JHN.6.11	 Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to the people who were sitting there. He did the same thing with the fish. All the people ate as much as they wanted.
JHN.6.12	 When the people were full, Jesus told his disciples, “Gather the leftover pieces so that nothing will be wasted.” 
JHN.6.13	 The disciples gathered the leftover pieces of bread and filled twelve baskets.
JHN.6.14	 When the people saw the miracle Jesus performed, they said, “This man is certainly the prophet who is to come into the world.” 
JHN.6.15	 Jesus realized that the people intended to take him by force and make him king. So he returned to the mountain by himself.
JHN.6.16	 When evening came, his disciples went to the sea. 
JHN.6.17	 They got into a boat and started to cross the sea to the city of Capernaum. By this time it was dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 
JHN.6.18	 A strong wind started to blow and stir up the sea.
JHN.6.19	 After they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea. He was coming near the boat, and they became terrified.
JHN.6.20	 Jesus told them, “It’s me. Don’t be afraid!”
JHN.6.21	 So they were willing to help Jesus into the boat. Immediately, the boat reached the shore where they were going.
JHN.6.22	 On the next day the people were still on the other side of the sea. They noticed that only one boat was there and that Jesus had not stepped into that boat with his disciples. The disciples had gone away without him. 
JHN.6.23	 Other boats from Tiberias arrived near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord gave thanks. 
JHN.6.24	 When the people saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into these boats and went to the city of Capernaum to look for Jesus. 
JHN.6.25	 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”
JHN.6.26	 Jesus replied to them, “I can guarantee this truth: You’re not looking for me because you saw miracles. You are looking for me because you ate as much of those loaves as you wanted. 
JHN.6.27	 Don’t work for food that spoils. Instead, work for the food that lasts into eternal life. This is the food the Son of Man will give you. After all, the Father has placed his seal of approval on him.”
JHN.6.28	 The people asked Jesus, “What does God want us to do?”
JHN.6.29	 Jesus replied to them, “God wants to do something for you so that you believe in the one whom he has sent.”
JHN.6.30	 The people asked him, “What miracle are you going to perform so that we can see it and believe in you? What are you going to do? 
JHN.6.31	 Our ancestors ate the manna in the desert. Scripture says, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ”
JHN.6.32	 Jesus said to them, “I can guarantee this truth: Moses didn’t give you bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. 
JHN.6.33	 God’s bread is the man who comes from heaven and gives life to the world.”
JHN.6.34	 They said to him, “Sir, give us this bread all the time.”
JHN.6.35	 Jesus told them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never become hungry, and whoever believes in me will never become thirsty. 
JHN.6.36	 I’ve told you that you have seen me. However, you don’t believe in me. 
JHN.6.37	 Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me. I will never turn away anyone who comes to me. 
JHN.6.38	 I haven’t come from heaven to do what I want to do. I’ve come to do what the one who sent me wants me to do. 
JHN.6.39	 The one who sent me doesn’t want me to lose any of those he gave me. He wants me to bring them back to life on the last day. 
JHN.6.40	 My Father wants all those who see the Son and believe in him to have eternal life. He wants me to bring them back to life on the last day.”
JHN.6.41	 The Jews began to criticize Jesus for saying, “I am the bread that came from heaven.” 
JHN.6.42	 They asked, “Isn’t this man Jesus, Joseph’s son? Don’t we know his father and mother? How can he say now, ‘I came from heaven’?”
JHN.6.43	 Jesus responded, “Stop criticizing me! 
JHN.6.44	 People cannot come to me unless the Father who sent me brings them to me. I will bring these people back to life on the last day. 
JHN.6.45	 The prophets wrote, ‘God will teach everyone.’ Those who do what they have learned from the Father come to me. 
JHN.6.46	 I’m saying that no one has seen the Father. Only the one who is from God has seen the Father. 
JHN.6.47	 I can guarantee this truth: Every believer has eternal life.
JHN.6.48	 “I am the bread of life. 
JHN.6.49	 Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert and died. 
JHN.6.50	 This is the bread that comes from heaven so that whoever eats it won’t die. 
JHN.6.51	 I am the living bread that came from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. The bread I will give to bring life to the world is my flesh.”
JHN.6.52	 The Jews began to quarrel with each other. They said, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
JHN.6.53	 Jesus told them, “I can guarantee this truth: If you don’t eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don’t have the source of life in you. 
JHN.6.54	 Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will bring them back to life on the last day. 
JHN.6.55	 My flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 
JHN.6.56	 Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood live in me, and I live in them. 
JHN.6.57	 The Father who has life sent me, and I live because of the Father. So those who feed on me will live because of me. 
JHN.6.58	 This is the bread that came from heaven. It is not like the bread your ancestors ate. They eventually died. Those who eat this bread will live forever.”
JHN.6.59	 Jesus said this while he was teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum. 
JHN.6.60	 When many of Jesus’ disciples heard him, they said, “What he says is hard to accept. Who wants to listen to him anymore?”
JHN.6.61	 Jesus was aware that his disciples were criticizing his message. So Jesus asked them, “Did what I say make you lose faith? 
JHN.6.62	 What if you see the Son of Man go where he was before? 
JHN.6.63	 Life is spiritual. Your physical existence doesn’t contribute to that life. The words that I have spoken to you are spiritual. They are life. 
JHN.6.64	 But some of you don’t believe.” Jesus knew from the beginning those who wouldn’t believe and the one who would betray him. 
JHN.6.65	 So he added, “That is why I told you that people cannot come to me unless the Father provides the way.”
JHN.6.66	 Jesus’ speech made many of his disciples go back to the lives they had led before they followed Jesus. 
JHN.6.67	 So Jesus asked the twelve apostles, “Do you want to leave me too?”
JHN.6.68	 Simon Peter answered Jesus, “Lord, to what person could we go? Your words give eternal life. 
JHN.6.69	 Besides, we believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.”
JHN.6.70	 Jesus replied, “I chose all twelve of you. Yet, one of you is a devil.” 
JHN.6.71	 Jesus meant Judas, son of Simon Iscariot. Judas, who was one of the twelve apostles, would later betray Jesus.
JHN.7.1	 Jesus later traveled throughout Galilee. He didn’t want to travel in Judea because Jews there wanted to kill him.
JHN.7.2	 The time for the Jewish Festival of Booths was near. 
JHN.7.3	 So Jesus’ brothers told him, “Leave this place, and go to Judea so that your disciples can see the things that you’re doing. 
JHN.7.4	 No one does things secretly when he wants to be known publicly. If you do these things, you should let the world see you.” 
JHN.7.5	 Even his brothers didn’t believe in him.
JHN.7.6	 Jesus told them, “Now is not the right time for me to go. Any time is right for you. 
JHN.7.7	 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I say that what everyone does is evil. 
JHN.7.8	 Go to the festival. I’m not going to this festival right now. Now is not the right time for me to go.”
JHN.7.9	 After saying this, Jesus stayed in Galilee. 
JHN.7.10	 But after his brothers had gone to the festival, Jesus went. He didn’t go publicly but secretly.
JHN.7.11	 The Jews were looking for Jesus in the crowd at the festival. They kept asking, “Where is that man?” 
JHN.7.12	 The crowds argued about Jesus. Some people said, “He’s a good man,” while others said, “No he isn’t. He deceives the people.” 
JHN.7.13	 Yet, no one would talk openly about him because they were afraid of the Jews.
JHN.7.14	 When the festival was half over, Jesus went to the temple courtyard and began to teach. 
JHN.7.15	 The Jews were surprised and asked, “How can this man be so educated when he hasn’t gone to school?”
JHN.7.16	 Jesus responded to them, “What I teach doesn’t come from me but from the one who sent me. 
JHN.7.17	 Those who want to follow the will of God will know if what I teach is from God or if I teach my own thoughts. 
JHN.7.18	 Those who speak their own thoughts are looking for their own glory. But the man who wants to bring glory to the one who sent him is a true teacher and doesn’t have dishonest motives. 
JHN.7.19	 Didn’t Moses give you his teachings? Yet, none of you does what Moses taught you. So why do you want to kill me?”
JHN.7.20	 The crowd answered, “You’re possessed by a demon! Who wants to kill you?”
JHN.7.21	 Jesus answered them, “I performed one miracle, and all of you are surprised by it. 
JHN.7.22	 Moses gave you the teaching about circumcision (although it didn’t come from Moses but from our ancestors). So you circumcise a male on a day of worship. 
JHN.7.23	 If you circumcise a male on the day of worship to follow Moses’ Teachings, why are you angry with me because I made a man entirely well on the day of worship? 
JHN.7.24	 Stop judging by outward appearance! Instead, judge correctly.”
JHN.7.25	 Some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this the man they want to kill? 
JHN.7.26	 But look at this! He’s speaking in public, and no one is saying anything to him! Can it be that the rulers really know that this man is the Messiah? 
JHN.7.27	 However, we know where this man comes from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from.”
JHN.7.28	 Then, while Jesus was teaching in the temple courtyard, he said loudly, “You know me, and you know where I come from. I didn’t decide to come on my own. The one who sent me is true. He’s the one you don’t know. 
JHN.7.29	 I know him because I am from him and he sent me.”
JHN.7.30	 The Jews tried to arrest him but couldn’t because his time had not yet come.
JHN.7.31	 However, many people in the crowd believed in him. They asked, “When the Messiah comes, will he perform more miracles than this man has?”
JHN.7.32	 The Pharisees heard the crowd saying things like this about him. So the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest Jesus.
JHN.7.33	 Jesus said, “I will still be with you for a little while. Then I’ll go to the one who sent me. 
JHN.7.34	 You will look for me, but you won’t find me. You can’t go where I’m going.”
JHN.7.35	 The Jews said among themselves, “Where does this man intend to go so that we won’t find him? Does he mean that he’ll live with the Jews who are scattered among the Greeks and that he’ll teach the Greeks? 
JHN.7.36	 What does he mean when he says, ‘You will look for me, but you won’t find me,’ and ‘You can’t go where I’m going’?”
JHN.7.37	 On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus was standing ⌊in the temple courtyard⌋. He said loudly, “Whoever is thirsty must come to me to drink. 
JHN.7.38	 As Scripture says, ‘Streams of living water will flow from deep within the person who believes in me.’” 
JHN.7.39	 Jesus said this about the Spirit, whom his believers would receive. The Spirit was not yet evident, as it would be after Jesus had been glorified.
JHN.7.40	 After some of the crowd heard Jesus say these words, they said, “This man is certainly the prophet.” 
JHN.7.41	 Other people said, “This man is the Messiah.” Still other people asked, “How can the Messiah come from Galilee? 
JHN.7.42	 Doesn’t Scripture say that the Messiah will come from the descendants of David and from the village of Bethlehem, where David lived?” 
JHN.7.43	 So the people were divided because of Jesus. 
JHN.7.44	 Some of them wanted to arrest him, but they couldn’t.
JHN.7.45	 When the temple guards returned, the chief priests and Pharisees asked them, “Why didn’t you bring Jesus?”
JHN.7.46	 The temple guards answered, “No human has ever spoken like this man.”
JHN.7.47	 The Pharisees asked the temple guards, “Have you been deceived too? 
JHN.7.48	 Has any ruler or any Pharisee believed in him? 
JHN.7.49	 This crowd is cursed because it doesn’t know Moses’ Teachings.”
JHN.7.50	 One of those Pharisees was Nicodemus, who had previously visited Jesus. Nicodemus asked them, 
JHN.7.51	 “Do Moses’ Teachings enable us to judge a person without first hearing that person’s side of the story? We can’t judge a person without finding out what that person has done.”
JHN.7.52	 They asked Nicodemus, “Are you saying this because you’re from Galilee? Study ⌊the Scriptures⌋, and you’ll see that no prophet comes from Galilee.” 
JHN.7.53	 Then each of them went home.
JHN.8.1	 Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 
JHN.8.2	 Early the next morning he returned to the temple courtyard. All the people went to him, so he sat down and began to teach them.
JHN.8.3	 The experts in Moses’ Teachings and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught committing adultery. They made her stand in front of everyone 
JHN.8.4	 and asked Jesus, “Teacher, we caught this woman in the act of adultery. 
JHN.8.5	 In his teachings, Moses ordered us to stone women like this to death. What do you say?” 
JHN.8.6	 They asked this to test him. They wanted to find a reason to bring charges against him.
JHN.8.6	Jesus bent down and used his finger to write on the ground. 
JHN.8.7	 When they persisted in asking him questions, he straightened up and said, “The person who is sinless should be the first to throw a stone at her.” 
JHN.8.8	 Then he bent down again and continued writing on the ground.
JHN.8.9	 One by one, beginning with the older men, the experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees left. Jesus was left alone with the woman. 
JHN.8.10	 Then Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Where did they go? Has anyone condemned you?”
JHN.8.11	 The woman answered, “No one, sir.”
JHN.8.11	Jesus said, “I don’t condemn you either. Go! From now on don’t sin.”
JHN.8.12	 Jesus spoke to the Pharisees again. He said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have a life filled with light and will never live in the dark.”
JHN.8.13	 The Pharisees said to him, “You testify on your own behalf, so your testimony isn’t true.”
JHN.8.14	 Jesus replied to them, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is true because I know where I came from and where I’m going. However, you don’t know where I came from or where I’m going. 
JHN.8.15	 You judge the way humans do. I don’t judge anyone. 
JHN.8.16	 Even if I do judge, my judgment is valid because I don’t make it on my own. I make my judgment with the Father who sent me. 
JHN.8.17	 Your own teachings say that the testimony of two people is true. 
JHN.8.18	 I testify on my own behalf, and so does the Father who sent me.”
JHN.8.19	 The Pharisees asked him, “Where is your father?”
JHN.8.19	Jesus replied, “You don’t know me or my Father. If you knew me, you would also know my Father.”
JHN.8.20	 Jesus spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury area of the temple courtyard. No one arrested him, because his time had not yet come.
JHN.8.21	 Jesus spoke to the Pharisees again. He said, “I’m going away, and you’ll look for me. But you will die because of your sin. You can’t go where I’m going.”
JHN.8.22	 Then the Jews asked, “Is he going to kill himself? Is that what he means when he says, ‘You can’t go where I’m going’?”
JHN.8.23	 Jesus said to them, “You’re from below. I’m from above. You’re from this world. I’m not from this world. 
JHN.8.24	 For this reason I told you that you’ll die because of your sins. If you don’t believe that I am the one, you’ll die because of your sins.”
JHN.8.25	 The Jews asked him, “Who did you say you are?”
JHN.8.25	Jesus told them, “I am who I said I was from the beginning. 
JHN.8.26	 I have a lot I could say about you and a lot I could condemn you for. But the one who sent me is true. So I tell the world exactly what he has told me.” 
JHN.8.27	 (The Jews didn’t know that he was talking to them about the Father.)
JHN.8.28	 So Jesus told them, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you’ll know that I am the one and that I can’t do anything on my own. Instead, I speak as the Father taught me. 
JHN.8.29	 Besides, the one who sent me is with me. He hasn’t left me by myself. I always do what pleases him.”
JHN.8.30	 As Jesus was saying this, many people believed in him. 
JHN.8.31	 So Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him, “If you live by what I say, you are truly my disciples. 
JHN.8.32	 You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
JHN.8.33	 They replied to Jesus, “We are Abraham’s descendants, and we’ve never been anyone’s slaves. So how can you say that we will be set free?”
JHN.8.34	 Jesus answered them, “I can guarantee this truth: Whoever lives a sinful life is a slave to sin. 
JHN.8.35	 A slave doesn’t live in the home forever, but a son does. 
JHN.8.36	 So if the Son sets you free, you will be absolutely free. 
JHN.8.37	 I know that you’re Abraham’s descendants. However, you want to kill me because you don’t like what I’m saying. 
JHN.8.38	 What I’m saying is what I have seen in my Father’s presence. But you do what you’ve heard from your father.”
JHN.8.39	 The Jews replied to Jesus, “Abraham is our father.”
JHN.8.39	Jesus told them, “If you were Abraham’s children, you would do what Abraham did. 
JHN.8.40	 I am a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. But now you want to kill me. Abraham wouldn’t have done that. 
JHN.8.41	 You’re doing what your father does.”
JHN.8.41	The Jews said to Jesus, “We’re not illegitimate children. God is our only Father.”
JHN.8.42	 Jesus told them, “If God were your Father, you would love me. After all, I’m here, and I came from God. I didn’t come on my own. Instead, God sent me. 
JHN.8.43	 Why don’t you understand the language I use? Is it because you can’t understand the words I use? 
JHN.8.44	 You come from your father, the devil, and you desire to do what your father wants you to do. The devil was a murderer from the beginning. He has never been truthful. He doesn’t know what the truth is. Whenever he tells a lie, he’s doing what comes naturally to him. He’s a liar and the father of lies. 
JHN.8.45	 So you don’t believe me because I tell the truth. 
JHN.8.46	 Can any of you convict me of committing a sin? If I’m telling the truth, why don’t you believe me? 
JHN.8.47	 The person who belongs to God understands what God says. You don’t understand because you don’t belong to God.”
JHN.8.48	 The Jews replied to Jesus, “Aren’t we right when we say that you’re a Samaritan and that you’re possessed by a demon?”
JHN.8.49	 Jesus answered, “I’m not possessed. I honor my Father, but you dishonor me. 
JHN.8.50	 I don’t want my own glory. But there is someone who wants it, and he is the judge. 
JHN.8.51	 I can guarantee this truth: Whoever obeys what I say will never see death.”
JHN.8.52	 The Jews told Jesus, “Now we know that you’re possessed by a demon. Abraham died, and so did the prophets, but you say, ‘Whoever does what I say will never taste death.’ 
JHN.8.53	 Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets have also died. Who do you think you are?”
JHN.8.54	 Jesus said, “If I bring glory to myself, my glory is nothing. My Father is the one who gives me glory, and you say that he is your God. 
JHN.8.55	 Yet, you haven’t known him. However, I know him. If I would say that I didn’t know him, I would be a liar like all of you. But I do know him, and I do what he says. 
JHN.8.56	 Your father Abraham was pleased to see that my day was coming. He saw it and was happy.”
JHN.8.57	 The Jews said to Jesus, “You’re not even fifty years old. How could you have seen Abraham?”
JHN.8.58	 Jesus told them, “I can guarantee this truth: Before Abraham was ever born, I am.”
JHN.8.59	 Then some of the Jews picked up stones to throw at Jesus. However, Jesus was concealed, and he left the temple courtyard.
JHN.9.1	 As Jesus walked along, he saw a man who had been born blind. 
JHN.9.2	 His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, why was this man born blind? Did he or his parents sin?”
JHN.9.3	 Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned. Instead, he was born blind so that God could show what he can do for him. 
JHN.9.4	 We must do what the one who sent me wants us to do while it is day. The night when no one can do anything is coming. 
JHN.9.5	 As long as I’m in the world, I’m light for the world.”
JHN.9.6	 After Jesus said this, he spit on the ground and mixed the spit with dirt. Then he smeared it on the man’s eyes 
JHN.9.7	 and told him, “Wash it off in the pool of Siloam.” (
JHN.9.8	 His neighbors and those who had previously seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?”
JHN.9.9	 Some of them said, “He’s the one.” Others said, “No, he isn’t, but he looks like him.” But the man himself said, “I am the one.”
JHN.9.10	 So they asked him, “How did you receive your sight?”
JHN.9.11	 He replied, “The man people call Jesus mixed some spit with dirt, smeared it on my eyes, and told me, ‘Go to Siloam, and wash it off.’ So I went there, washed it off, and received my sight.”
JHN.9.12	 They asked him, “Where is that man?”
JHN.9.12	The man answered, “I don’t know.”
JHN.9.13	 Some people brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees. 
JHN.9.14	 The day when Jesus mixed the spit and dirt and gave the man sight was a day of worship. 
JHN.9.15	 So the Pharisees asked the man again how he received his sight.
JHN.9.15	The man told the Pharisees, “He put a mixture of spit and dirt on my eyes. I washed it off, and now I can see.”
JHN.9.16	 Some of the Pharisees said, “The man who did this is not from God because he doesn’t follow the traditions for the day of worship.” Other Pharisees asked, “How can a man who is a sinner perform miracles like these?” So the Pharisees were divided in their opinions.
JHN.9.17	 They asked the man who had been born blind another question: “What do you say about the man who gave you sight?”
JHN.9.17	The man answered, “He’s a prophet.”
JHN.9.18	 Until they talked to the man’s parents, the Jews didn’t believe that the man had been blind and had been given sight. 
JHN.9.19	 They asked his parents, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? Why can he see now?”
JHN.9.20	 His parents replied, “We know that he’s our son and that he was born blind. 
JHN.9.21	 But we don’t know how he got his sight or who gave it to him. You’ll have to ask him. He’s old enough to answer for himself.” 
JHN.9.22	 (His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. The Jews had already agreed to put anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ out of the synagogue. 
JHN.9.23	 That’s why his parents said, “You’ll have to ask him. He’s old enough.”)
JHN.9.24	 So once again the Jews called the man who had been blind. They told him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man who gave you sight is a sinner.”
JHN.9.25	 The man responded, “I don’t know if he’s a sinner or not. But I do know one thing. I used to be blind, but now I can see.”
JHN.9.26	 The Jews asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he give you sight?”
JHN.9.27	 The man replied, “I’ve already told you, but you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear the story again? Do you want to become his disciples too?”
JHN.9.28	 The Jews yelled at him, “You’re his disciple, but we’re Moses’ disciples. 
JHN.9.29	 We know that God spoke to Moses, but we don’t know where this man came from.”
JHN.9.30	 The man replied to them, “That’s amazing! You don’t know where he’s from. Yet, he gave me sight. 
JHN.9.31	 We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners. Instead, he listens to people who are devout and who do what he wants. 
JHN.9.32	 Since the beginning of time, no one has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a person born blind. 
JHN.9.33	 If this man were not from God, he couldn’t do anything like that.”
JHN.9.34	 The Jews answered him, “You were born full of sin. Do you think you can teach us?” Then they threw him out ⌊of the synagogue⌋.
JHN.9.35	 Jesus heard that the Jews had thrown the man out ⌊of the synagogue⌋. So when Jesus found the man, he asked him, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”
JHN.9.36	 The man replied, “Sir, tell me who he is so that I can believe in him.”
JHN.9.37	 Jesus told him, “You’ve seen him. He is the person who is now talking with you.”
JHN.9.38	 The man bowed in front of Jesus and said, “I believe, Lord.”
JHN.9.39	 Then Jesus said, “I have come into this world to judge: Blind people will be given sight, and those who can see will become blind.”
JHN.9.40	 Some Pharisees who were with Jesus heard this. So they asked him, “Do you think we’re blind?”
JHN.9.41	 Jesus told them, “If you were blind, you wouldn’t be sinners. But now you say, ‘We see,’ so you continue to be sinners.
JHN.10.1	 “I can guarantee this truth: The person who doesn’t enter the sheep pen through the gate but climbs in somewhere else is a thief or a robber. 
JHN.10.2	 But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd. 
JHN.10.3	 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep respond to his voice. He calls his sheep by name and leads them out of the pen. 
JHN.10.4	 After he has brought out all his sheep, he walks ahead of them. The sheep follow him because they recognize his voice. 
JHN.10.5	 They won’t follow a stranger. Instead, they will run away from a stranger because they don’t recognize his voice.” 
JHN.10.6	 Jesus used this illustration as he talked to the people, but they didn’t understand what he meant.
JHN.10.7	 Jesus emphasized, “I can guarantee this truth: I am the gate for the sheep. 
JHN.10.8	 All who came before I did were thieves or robbers. However, the sheep didn’t respond to them. 
JHN.10.9	 I am the gate. Those who enter the sheep pen through me will be saved. They will go in and out of the sheep pen and find food. 
JHN.10.10	 A thief comes to steal, kill, and destroy. But I came so that my sheep will have life and so that they will have everything they need.
JHN.10.11	 “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep. 
JHN.10.12	 A hired hand isn’t a shepherd and doesn’t own the sheep. When he sees a wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and quickly runs away. So the wolf drags the sheep away and scatters the flock. 
JHN.10.13	 The hired hand is concerned about what he’s going to get paid and not about the sheep.
JHN.10.14	 “I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep as the Father knows me.
JHN.10.15	 So I give my life for my sheep. 
JHN.10.16	 I also have other sheep that are not from this pen. I must lead them. They, too, will respond to my voice. So they will be one flock with one shepherd. 
JHN.10.17	 The Father loves me because I give my life in order to take it back again. 
JHN.10.18	 No one takes my life from me. I give my life of my own free will. I have the authority to give my life, and I have the authority to take my life back again. This is what my Father ordered me to do.”
JHN.10.19	 The Jews were divided because of what Jesus said. 
JHN.10.20	 Many of them said, “He’s possessed by a demon! He’s crazy! Why do you listen to him?” 
JHN.10.21	 Others said, “No one talks like this if he’s possessed by a demon. Can a demon give sight to the blind?”
JHN.10.22	 The Festival of the Dedication of the Temple took place in Jerusalem during the winter. 
JHN.10.23	 Jesus was walking on Solomon’s porch in the temple courtyard.
JHN.10.24	 The Jews surrounded him. They asked him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”
JHN.10.25	 Jesus answered them, “I’ve told you, but you don’t believe me. The things that I do in my Father’s name testify on my behalf. 
JHN.10.26	 However, you don’t believe because you’re not my sheep. 
JHN.10.27	 My sheep respond to my voice, and I know who they are. They follow me, 
JHN.10.28	 and I give them eternal life. They will never be lost, and no one will tear them away from me. 
JHN.10.29	 My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than everyone else, and no one can tear them away from my Father. 
JHN.10.30	 The Father and I are one.”
JHN.10.31	 The Jews had again brought some rocks to stone Jesus to death. 
JHN.10.32	 Jesus replied to them, “I’ve shown you many good things that come from the Father. For which of these good things do you want to stone me to death?”
JHN.10.33	 The Jews answered Jesus, “We’re going to stone you to death, not for any good things you’ve done, but for dishonoring God. You claim to be God, although you’re only a man.”
JHN.10.34	 Jesus said to them, “Don’t your Scriptures say, ‘I said, “You are gods” ’? 
JHN.10.35	 The Scriptures cannot be discredited. So if God calls people gods (and they are the people to whom he gave the Scriptures), 
JHN.10.36	 why do you say that I’m dishonoring God because I said, ‘I’m the Son of God’? God set me apart for this holy purpose and has sent me into the world. 
JHN.10.37	 If I’m not doing the things my Father does, don’t believe me. 
JHN.10.38	 But if I’m doing those things and you refuse to believe me, then at least believe the things that I’m doing. Then you will know and recognize that the Father is in me and that I am in the Father.”
JHN.10.39	 The Jews tried to arrest Jesus again, but he got away from them. 
JHN.10.40	 He went back across the Jordan River and stayed in the place where John first baptized people.
JHN.10.41	 Many people went to Jesus. They said, “John didn’t perform any miracles, but everything John said about this man is true.” 
JHN.10.42	 Many people there believed in Jesus.
JHN.11.1	 Lazarus, who lived in Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived, was sick. 
JHN.11.2	 (Mary was the woman who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was the one who was sick.)
JHN.11.3	 So the sisters sent a messenger to tell Jesus, “Lord, your close friend is sick.”
JHN.11.4	 When Jesus heard the message, he said, “His sickness won’t result in death. Instead, this sickness will bring glory to God so that the Son of God will receive glory through it.”
JHN.11.5	 Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus. 
JHN.11.6	 Yet, when Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days.
JHN.11.7	 Then, after the two days, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s go back to Judea.”
JHN.11.8	 The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, not long ago the Jews wanted to stone you to death. Do you really want to go back there?”
JHN.11.9	 Jesus answered, “Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight? Those who walk during the day don’t stumble, because they see the light of this world. 
JHN.11.10	 However, those who walk at night stumble because they have no light in themselves.”
JHN.11.11	 After Jesus said this, he told his disciples, “Our friend Lazarus is sleeping, and I’m going to Bethany to wake him.”
JHN.11.12	 His disciples said to him, “Lord, if he’s sleeping, he’ll get well.”
JHN.11.13	 Jesus meant that Lazarus was dead, but the disciples thought Jesus meant that Lazarus was only sleeping. 
JHN.11.14	 Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died, 
JHN.11.15	 but I’m glad that I wasn’t there so that you can grow in faith. Let’s go to Lazarus.”
JHN.11.16	 Thomas, who was called Didymus, said to the rest of the disciples, “Let’s go so that we, too, can die with Jesus.”
JHN.11.17	 When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb for four days. 
JHN.11.18	 (Bethany was near Jerusalem, not quite two miles away.) 
JHN.11.19	 Many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them about their brother.
JHN.11.20	 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. Mary stayed at home. 
JHN.11.21	 Martha told Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
JHN.11.22	 But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask him.”
JHN.11.23	 Jesus told Martha, “Your brother will come back to life.”
JHN.11.24	 Martha answered Jesus, “I know that he’ll come back to life on the last day, when everyone will come back to life.”
JHN.11.25	 Jesus said to her, “I am the one who brings people back to life, and I am life itself. Those who believe in me will live even if they die. 
JHN.11.26	 Everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe that?”
JHN.11.27	 Martha said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who was expected to come into the world.”
JHN.11.28	 After Martha had said this, she went back home and whispered to her sister Mary, “The teacher is here, and he is calling for you.”
JHN.11.29	 When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Jesus. 
JHN.11.30	 (Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still where Martha had met him.) 
JHN.11.31	 The Jews who were comforting Mary in the house saw her get up quickly and leave. So they followed her. They thought that she was going to the tomb to cry. 
JHN.11.32	 When Mary arrived where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
JHN.11.33	 When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who were crying with her, he was deeply moved and troubled.
JHN.11.34	 So Jesus asked, “Where did you put Lazarus?”
JHN.11.34	They answered him, “Lord, come and see.”
JHN.11.35	 Jesus cried. 
JHN.11.36	 The Jews said, “See how much Jesus loved him.” 
JHN.11.37	 But some of the Jews asked, “Couldn’t this man who gave a blind man sight keep Lazarus from dying?”
JHN.11.38	 Deeply moved again, Jesus went to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone covering the entrance. 
JHN.11.39	 Jesus said, “Take the stone away.”
JHN.11.39	Martha, the dead man’s sister, told Jesus, “Lord, there must already be a stench. He’s been dead for four days.”
JHN.11.40	 Jesus said to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believe, you would see God’s glory?” 
JHN.11.41	 So the stone was moved away from the entrance of the tomb.
JHN.11.41	Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you for hearing me. 
JHN.11.42	 I’ve known that you always hear me. However, I’ve said this so that the crowd standing around me will believe that you sent me.” 
JHN.11.43	 After Jesus had said this, he shouted as loudly as he could, “Lazarus, come out!”
JHN.11.44	 The dead man came out. Strips of cloth were wound around his feet and hands, and his face was wrapped with a handkerchief. Jesus told them, “Free Lazarus, and let him go.”
JHN.11.45	 Many Jews who had visited Mary and had seen what Jesus had done believed in him. 
JHN.11.46	 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 
JHN.11.47	 So the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the council. They asked, “What are we doing? This man is performing a lot of miracles. 
JHN.11.48	 If we let him continue what he’s doing, everyone will believe in him. Then the Romans will take away our position and our nation.”
JHN.11.49	 One of them, Caiaphas, who was chief priest that year, told them, “You people don’t know anything. 
JHN.11.50	 You haven’t even considered this: It is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed.”
JHN.11.51	 Caiaphas didn’t say this on his own. As chief priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation. 
JHN.11.52	 He prophesied that Jesus wouldn’t die merely for this nation, but that Jesus would die to bring God’s scattered children together and make them one.
JHN.11.53	 From that day on, the Jewish council planned to kill Jesus. 
JHN.11.54	 So Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews. Instead, he left Bethany and went to the countryside near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
JHN.11.55	 The Jewish Passover was near. Many people came from the countryside to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover. 
JHN.11.56	 As they stood in the temple courtyard, they looked for Jesus and asked each other, “Do you think that he’ll avoid coming to the festival?” 
JHN.11.57	 (The chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that whoever knew where Jesus was should tell them so that they could arrest him.)
JHN.12.1	 Six days before Passover, Jesus arrived in Bethany. Lazarus, whom Jesus had brought back to life, lived there. 
JHN.12.2	 Dinner was prepared for Jesus in Bethany. Martha served the dinner, and Lazarus was one of the people eating with Jesus.
JHN.12.3	 Mary took a bottle of very expensive perfume made from pure nard and poured it on Jesus’ feet. Then she dried his feet with her hair. The fragrance of the perfume filled the house.
JHN.12.4	 One of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray him, asked, 
JHN.12.5	 “Why wasn’t this perfume sold for a high price and the money given to the poor?” 
JHN.12.6	 (Judas didn’t say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief. He was in charge of the moneybag and carried the contributions.) 
JHN.12.7	 Jesus said to Judas, “Leave her alone! She has done this to prepare me for the day I will be placed in a tomb. 
JHN.12.8	 You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me with you.”
JHN.12.9	 A large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was in Bethany. So they went there not only to see Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had brought back to life. 
JHN.12.10	 The chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too. 
JHN.12.11	 Lazarus was the reason why many people were leaving the Jews and believing in Jesus.
JHN.12.12	 On the next day the large crowd that had come to the Passover festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 
JHN.12.13	 So they took palm branches and went to meet him. They were shouting,
JHN.12.13	“Hosanna!
JHN.12.13	Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord,
JHN.12.13	the king of Israel!”
JHN.12.14	 Jesus obtained a donkey and sat on it, as Scripture says:
JHN.12.15	 “Don’t be afraid, people of Zion!
JHN.12.15	Your king is coming.
JHN.12.15	He is riding on a donkey’s colt.”
JHN.12.16	 At first Jesus’ disciples didn’t know what these prophecies meant. However, when Jesus was glorified, the disciples remembered that these prophecies had been written about him. The disciples remembered that they had taken part in fulfilling the prophecies.
JHN.12.17	 The people who had been with Jesus when he called Lazarus from the tomb and brought him back to life reported what they had seen. 
JHN.12.18	 Because the crowd heard that Jesus had performed this miracle, they came to meet him.
JHN.12.19	 The Pharisees said to each other, “This is getting us nowhere. Look! The whole world is following him!”
JHN.12.20	 Some Greeks were among those who came to worship during the Passover festival. 
JHN.12.21	 They went to Philip (who was from Bethsaida in Galilee) and told him, “Sir, we would like to meet Jesus.” 
JHN.12.22	 Philip told Andrew, and they told Jesus.
JHN.12.23	 Jesus replied to them, “The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 
JHN.12.24	 I can guarantee this truth: A single grain of wheat doesn’t produce anything unless it is planted in the ground and dies. If it dies, it will produce a lot of grain. 
JHN.12.25	 Those who love their lives will destroy them, and those who hate their lives in this world will guard them for everlasting life. 
JHN.12.26	 Those who serve me must follow me. My servants will be with me wherever I will be. If people serve me, the Father will honor them.
JHN.12.27	 “I am too deeply troubled now to know how to express my feelings. Should I say, ‘Father, save me from this time ⌊of suffering⌋’? No! I came for this time of suffering. 
JHN.12.28	 Father, give glory to your name.”
JHN.12.28	A voice from heaven said, “I have given it glory, and I will give it glory again.”
JHN.12.29	 The crowd standing there heard the voice and said that it had thundered. Others in the crowd said that an angel had talked to him. 
JHN.12.30	 Jesus replied, “That voice wasn’t for my benefit but for yours.
JHN.12.31	 “This world is being judged now. The ruler of this world will be thrown out now. 
JHN.12.32	 When I have been lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people toward me.” 
JHN.12.33	 By saying this, he indicated how he was going to die.
JHN.12.34	 The crowd responded to him, “We have heard from the Scriptures that the Messiah will remain here forever. So how can you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up from the earth’? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”
JHN.12.35	 Jesus answered the crowd, “The light will still be with you for a little while. Walk while you have light so that darkness won’t defeat you. Those who walk in the dark don’t know where they’re going. 
JHN.12.36	 While you have the light, believe in the light so that you will become people whose lives show the light.”
JHN.12.36	After Jesus had said this, he was concealed as he left. 
JHN.12.37	 Although they had seen Jesus perform so many miracles, they wouldn’t believe in him. 
JHN.12.38	 In this way the words of the prophet Isaiah came true:
JHN.12.38	“Lord, who has believed our message?
JHN.12.38	To whom has the Lord’s power been revealed?”
JHN.12.39	 So the people couldn’t believe because, as Isaiah also said,
JHN.12.40	 “God blinded them
JHN.12.40	and made them close-minded
JHN.12.40	so that their eyes don’t see
JHN.12.40	and their minds don’t understand.
JHN.12.40	And they never turn to me for healing!”
JHN.12.41	 Isaiah said this because he had seen Jesus’ glory and had spoken about him.
JHN.12.42	 Many rulers believed in Jesus. However, they wouldn’t admit it publicly because the Pharisees would have thrown them out of the synagogue. 
JHN.12.43	 They were more concerned about what people thought of them than about what God thought of them.
JHN.12.44	 Then Jesus said loudly, “Whoever believes in me believes not only in me but also in the one who sent me. 
JHN.12.45	 Whoever sees me sees the one who sent me. 
JHN.12.46	 I am the light that has come into the world so that everyone who believes in me will not live in the dark. 
JHN.12.47	 If anyone hears my words and doesn’t follow them, I don’t condemn them. I didn’t come to condemn the world but to save the world. 
JHN.12.48	 Those who reject me by not accepting what I say have a judge appointed for them. The words that I have spoken will judge them on the last day. 
JHN.12.49	 I have not spoken on my own. Instead, the Father who sent me told me what I should say and how I should say it. 
JHN.12.50	 I know that what he commands is eternal life. Whatever I say is what the Father told me to say.”
JHN.13.1	 Before the Passover festival, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go back to the Father. Jesus loved his own who were in the world, and he loved them to the end.
JHN.13.2	 While supper was taking place, the devil had already put the idea of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.
JHN.13.3	 The Father had put everything in Jesus’ control. Jesus knew that. He also knew that he had come from God and was going back to God. 
JHN.13.4	 So he got up from the table, removed his outer clothes, took a towel, and tied it around his waist. 
JHN.13.5	 Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and dry them with the towel that he had tied around his waist.
JHN.13.6	 When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter asked him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”
JHN.13.7	 Jesus answered Peter, “You don’t know now what I’m doing. You will understand later.”
JHN.13.8	 Peter told Jesus, “You will never wash my feet.”
JHN.13.8	Jesus replied to Peter, “If I don’t wash you, you don’t belong to me.”
JHN.13.9	 Simon Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, don’t wash only my feet. Wash my hands and my head too!”
JHN.13.10	 Jesus told Peter, “People who have washed are completely clean. They need to have only their feet washed. All of you, except for one, are clean.” 
JHN.13.11	 (Jesus knew who was going to betray him. That’s why he said, “All of you, except for one, are clean.”)
JHN.13.12	 After Jesus had washed their feet and put on his outer clothes, he took his place at the table again. Then he asked his disciples, “Do you understand what I’ve done for you? 
JHN.13.13	 You call me teacher and Lord, and you’re right because that’s what I am. 
JHN.13.14	 So if I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you must wash each other’s feet. 
JHN.13.15	 I’ve given you an example that you should follow. 
JHN.13.16	 I can guarantee this truth: Slaves are not superior to their owners, and messengers are not superior to the people who send them. 
JHN.13.17	 If you understand all of this, you are blessed whenever you follow my example.
JHN.13.18	 “I’m not talking about all of you. I know the people I’ve chosen ⌊to be apostles⌋. However, I’ve made my choice so that Scripture will come true. It says, ‘The one who eats my bread has turned against me.’ 
JHN.13.19	 I’m telling you now before it happens. Then, when it happens, you will believe that I am the one.
JHN.13.20	 “I can guarantee this truth: Whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.”
JHN.13.21	 After saying this, Jesus was deeply troubled. He declared, “I can guarantee this truth: One of you is going to betray me!”
JHN.13.22	 The disciples began looking at each other and wondering which one of them Jesus meant.
JHN.13.23	 One disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, was near him at the table. 
JHN.13.24	 Simon Peter motioned to that disciple and said, “Ask Jesus whom he’s talking about!”
JHN.13.25	 Leaning close to Jesus, that disciple asked, “Lord, who is it?”
JHN.13.26	 Jesus answered, “He’s the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I’ve dipped it in the sauce.” So Jesus dipped the bread and gave it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.
JHN.13.27	 Then, after Judas took the piece of bread, Satan entered him. So Jesus told him, “Hurry! Do what you have to do.” 
JHN.13.28	 No one at the table knew why Jesus said this to him. 
JHN.13.29	 Judas had the moneybag. So some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what they needed for the festival or to give something to the poor.
JHN.13.30	 Judas took the piece of bread and immediately went outside. It was night.
JHN.13.31	 When Judas was gone, Jesus said, “The Son of Man is now glorified, and because of him God is glorified. 
JHN.13.32	 If God is glorified because of the Son of Man, God will glorify the Son of Man because of himself, and he will glorify the Son of Man at once.”
JHN.13.33	 Jesus said, “Dear children, I will still be with you for a little while. I’m telling you what I told the Jews. You will look for me, but you can’t go where I’m going.
JHN.13.34	 “I’m giving you a new commandment: Love each other in the same way that I have loved you. 
JHN.13.35	 Everyone will know that you are my disciples because of your love for each other.”
JHN.13.36	 Simon Peter asked him, “Lord, where are you going?”
JHN.13.36	Jesus answered him, “You can’t follow me now to the place where I’m going. However, you will follow me later.”
JHN.13.37	 Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I’ll give my life for you.”
JHN.13.38	 Jesus replied, “Will you give your life for me? I can guarantee this truth: No rooster will crow until you say three times that you don’t know me.
JHN.14.1	 “Don’t be troubled. Believe in God, and believe in me. 
JHN.14.2	 My Father’s house has many rooms. If that were not true, would I have told you that I’m going to prepare a place for you? 
JHN.14.3	 If I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again. Then I will bring you into my presence so that you will be where I am. 
JHN.14.4	 You know the way to the place where I am going.”
JHN.14.5	 Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you’re going. So how can we know the way?”
JHN.14.6	 Jesus answered him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one goes to the Father except through me. 
JHN.14.7	 If you have known me, you will also know my Father. From now on you know him ⌊through me⌋ and have seen him ⌊in me⌋.”
JHN.14.8	 Philip said to Jesus, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will satisfy us.”
JHN.14.9	 Jesus replied, “I have been with all of you for a long time. Don’t you know me yet, Philip? The person who has seen me has seen the Father. So how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? 
JHN.14.10	 Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? What I’m telling you doesn’t come from me. The Father, who lives in me, does what he wants. 
JHN.14.11	 Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me. Otherwise, believe me because of the things I do.
JHN.14.12	 “I can guarantee this truth: Those who believe in me will do the things that I am doing. They will do even greater things because I am going to the Father. 
JHN.14.13	 I will do anything you ask ⌊the Father⌋ in my name so that the Father will be given glory because of the Son. 
JHN.14.14	 If you ask me to do something, I will do it.
JHN.14.15	 “If you love me, you will obey my commandments. 
JHN.14.16	 I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper who will be with you forever. 
JHN.14.17	 That helper is the Spirit of Truth. The world cannot accept him, because it doesn’t see or know him. You know him, because he lives with you and will be in you.
JHN.14.18	 “I will not leave you all alone. I will come back to you. 
JHN.14.19	 In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. You will live because I live. 
JHN.14.20	 On that day you will know that I am in my Father and that you are in me and that I am in you. 
JHN.14.21	 Whoever knows and obeys my commandments is the person who loves me. Those who love me will have my Father’s love, and I, too, will love them and show myself to them.”
JHN.14.22	 Judas (not Iscariot) asked Jesus, “Lord, what has happened that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?”
JHN.14.23	 Jesus answered him, “Those who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will go to them and make our home with them. 
JHN.14.24	 A person who doesn’t love me doesn’t do what I say. I don’t make up what you hear me say. What I say comes from the Father who sent me.
JHN.14.25	 “I have told you this while I’m still with you. 
JHN.14.26	 However, the helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything. He will remind you of everything that I have ever told you.
JHN.14.27	 “I’m leaving you peace. I’m giving you my peace. I don’t give you the kind of peace that the world gives. So don’t be troubled or cowardly. 
JHN.14.28	 You heard me tell you, ‘I’m going away, but I’m coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I’m going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am.
JHN.14.29	 “I’m telling you this now before it happens. When it does happen, you will believe. 
JHN.14.30	 The ruler of this world has no power over me. But he’s coming, so I won’t talk with you much longer. 
JHN.14.31	 However, I want the world to know that I love the Father and that I am doing exactly what the Father has commanded me to do. Get up! We have to leave.”
JHN.15.1	 ⌊Then Jesus said,⌋ “I am the true vine, and my Father takes care of the vineyard. 
JHN.15.2	 He removes every one of my branches that doesn’t produce fruit. He also prunes every branch that does produce fruit to make it produce more fruit.
JHN.15.3	 “You are already clean 
JHN.15.4	 Live in me, and I will live in you. A branch cannot produce any fruit by itself. It has to stay attached to the vine. In the same way, you cannot produce fruit unless you live in me.
JHN.15.5	 “I am the vine. You are the branches. Those who live in me while I live in them will produce a lot of fruit. But you can’t produce anything without me. 
JHN.15.6	 Whoever doesn’t live in me is thrown away like a branch and dries up. Branches like this are gathered, thrown into a fire, and burned. 
JHN.15.7	 If you live in me and what I say lives in you, then ask for anything you want, and it will be yours. 
JHN.15.8	 You give glory to my Father when you produce a lot of fruit and therefore show that you are my disciples.
JHN.15.9	 “I have loved you the same way the Father has loved me. So live in my love. 
JHN.15.10	 If you obey my commandments, you will live in my love. I have obeyed my Father’s commandments, and in that way I live in his love. 
JHN.15.11	 I have told you this so that you will be as joyful as I am, and your joy will be complete. 
JHN.15.12	 Love each other as I have loved you. This is what I’m commanding you to do. 
JHN.15.13	 The greatest love you can show is to give your life for your friends. 
JHN.15.14	 You are my friends if you obey my commandments. 
JHN.15.15	 I don’t call you servants anymore, because a servant doesn’t know what his master is doing. But I’ve called you friends because I’ve made known to you everything that I’ve heard from my Father. 
JHN.15.16	 You didn’t choose me, but I chose you. I have appointed you to go, to produce fruit that will last, and to ask the Father in my name to give you whatever you ask for. 
JHN.15.17	 Love each other. This is what I’m commanding you to do.
JHN.15.18	 “If the world hates you, realize that it hated me before it hated you. 
JHN.15.19	 If you had anything in common with the world, the world would love you as one of its own. But you don’t have anything in common with the world. I chose you from the world, and that’s why the world hates you. 
JHN.15.20	 Remember what I told you: ‘A servant isn’t greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they did what I said, they will also do what you say. 
JHN.15.21	 Indeed, they will do all this to you because you are committed to me, since they don’t know the one who sent me. 
JHN.15.22	 If I hadn’t come and spoken to them, they wouldn’t have any sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin. 
JHN.15.23	 The person who hates me also hates my Father. 
JHN.15.24	 If I hadn’t done among them what no one else has done, they wouldn’t have any sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. 
JHN.15.25	 In this way what is written in their Scriptures has come true: ‘They hate me for no reason.’
JHN.15.26	 “The helper whom I will send to you from the Father will come. This helper, the Spirit of Truth who comes from the Father, will declare the truth about me. 
JHN.15.27	 You will declare the truth, too, because you have been with me from the beginning.”
JHN.16.1	 ⌊Jesus continued,⌋ “I have said these things to you so that you won’t lose your faith. 
JHN.16.2	 You will be thrown out of synagogues. Certainly, the time is coming when people who murder you will think that they are serving God. 
JHN.16.3	 They will do these things to you because they haven’t known the Father or me. 
JHN.16.4	 But I’ve told you this so that when it happens you’ll remember what I’ve told you. I didn’t tell you this at first, because I was with you.
JHN.16.5	 “Now I’m going to the one who sent me. Yet, none of you asks me where I’m going. 
JHN.16.6	 But because I’ve told you this, you’re filled with sadness. 
JHN.16.7	 However, I am telling you the truth: It’s good for you that I’m going away. If I don’t go away, the helper won’t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. 
JHN.16.8	 He will come to convict the world of sin, to show the world what has God’s approval, and to convince the world that God judges it. 
JHN.16.9	 He will convict the world of sin, because people don’t believe in me. 
JHN.16.10	 He will show the world what has God’s approval, because I’m going to the Father and you won’t see me anymore. 
JHN.16.11	 He will convince the world that God judges it, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
JHN.16.12	 “I have a lot more to tell you, but that would be too much for you now. 
JHN.16.13	 When the Spirit of Truth comes, he will guide you into the full truth. He won’t speak on his own. He will speak what he hears and will tell you about things to come. 
JHN.16.14	 He will give me glory, because he will tell you what I say. 
JHN.16.15	 Everything the Father says is also what I say. That is why I said, ‘He will take what I say and tell it to you.’
JHN.16.16	 “In a little while you won’t see me anymore. Then in a little while you will see me again.”
JHN.16.17	 Some of his disciples said to each other, “What does he mean? He tells us that in a little while we won’t see him. Then he tells us that in a little while we will see him again and that he’s going to the Father.” 
JHN.16.18	 So they were asking each other, “What does he mean when he says, ‘In a little while’? We don’t understand what he’s talking about.”
JHN.16.19	 Jesus knew they wanted to ask him something. So he said to them, “Are you trying to figure out among yourselves what I meant when I said, ‘In a little while you won’t see me, and in a little while you will see me again’? 
JHN.16.20	 I can guarantee this truth: You will cry because you are sad, but the world will be happy. You will feel pain, but your pain will turn to happiness. 
JHN.16.21	 A woman has pain when her time to give birth comes. But after the child is born, she doesn’t remember the pain anymore because she’s happy that a child has been brought into the world.
JHN.16.22	 “Now you’re in a painful situation. But I will see you again. Then you will be happy, and no one will take that happiness away from you. 
JHN.16.23	 When that day comes, you won’t ask me any more questions. I can guarantee this truth: If you ask the Father for anything in my name, he will give it to you. 
JHN.16.24	 So far you haven’t asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive so that you can be completely happy.
JHN.16.25	 “I have used examples to illustrate these things. The time is coming when I won’t use examples to speak to you. Rather, I will speak to you about the Father in plain words. 
JHN.16.26	 When that day comes, you will ask for what you want in my name. I’m telling you that I won’t have to ask the Father for you. 
JHN.16.27	 The Father loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. 
JHN.16.28	 I left the Father and came into the world. Again, ⌊as I’ve said,⌋ I’m going to leave the world and go back to the Father.”
JHN.16.29	 His disciples said, “Now you’re talking in plain words and not using examples. 
JHN.16.30	 Now we know that you know everything. You don’t need to wait for questions to be asked. Because of this, we believe that you have come from God.”
JHN.16.31	 Jesus replied to them, “Now you believe. 
JHN.16.32	 The time is coming, and is already here, when all of you will be scattered. Each of you will go your own way and leave me all alone. Yet, I’m not all alone, because the Father is with me. 
JHN.16.33	 I’ve told you this so that my peace will be with you. In the world you’ll have trouble. But cheer up! I have overcome the world.”
JHN.17.1	 After saying this, Jesus looked up to heaven and said, “Father, the time is here. Give your Son glory so that your Son can give you glory. 
JHN.17.2	 After all, you’ve given him authority over all humanity so that he can give eternal life to all those you gave to him. 
JHN.17.3	 This is eternal life: to know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you sent. 
JHN.17.4	 On earth I have given you glory by finishing the work you gave me to do. 
JHN.17.5	 Now, Father, give me glory in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world existed.
JHN.17.6	 “I made your name known to the people you gave me. They are from this world. They belonged to you, and you gave them to me. They did what you told them. 
JHN.17.7	 Now they know that everything you gave me comes from you, 
JHN.17.8	 because I gave them the message that you gave me. They have accepted this message, and they know for sure that I came from you. They have believed that you sent me.
JHN.17.9	 “I pray for them. I’m not praying for the world but for those you gave me, because they are yours. 
JHN.17.10	 Everything I have is yours, and everything you have is mine. I have been given glory by the people you have given me. 
JHN.17.11	 I won’t be in the world much longer, but they are in the world, and I’m coming back to you. Holy Father, keep them safe by the power of your name, the name that you gave me, so that their unity may be like ours. 
JHN.17.12	 While I was with them, I kept them safe by the power of your name, the name that you gave me. I watched over them, and none of them, except one person, became lost. So Scripture came true.
JHN.17.13	 “But now, ⌊Father,⌋ I’m coming back to you. I say these things while I’m still in the world so that they will have the same joy that I have. 
JHN.17.14	 I have given them your message. But the world has hated them because they don’t belong to the world any more than I belong to the world. 
JHN.17.15	 I’m not asking you to take them out of the world but to protect them from the evil one. 
JHN.17.16	 They don’t belong to the world any more than I belong to the world.
JHN.17.17	 “Use the truth to make them holy. Your words are truth. 
JHN.17.18	 I have sent them into the world the same way you sent me into the world. 
JHN.17.19	 I’m dedicating myself to this holy work I’m doing for them so that they, too, will use the truth to be holy.
JHN.17.20	 “I’m not praying only for them. I’m also praying for those who will believe in me through their message. 
JHN.17.21	 I pray that all of these people continue to have unity in the way that you, Father, are in me and I am in you. I pray that they may be united with us so that the world will believe that you have sent me. 
JHN.17.22	 I have given them the glory that you gave me. I did this so that they are united in the same way we are. 
JHN.17.23	 I am in them, and you are in me. So they are completely united. In this way the world knows that you have sent me and that you have loved them in the same way you have loved me.
JHN.17.24	 “Father, I want those you have given to me to be with me, to be where I am. I want them to see my glory, which you gave me because you loved me before the world was made. 
JHN.17.25	 Righteous Father, the world didn’t know you. Yet, I knew you, and these ⌊disciples⌋ have known that you sent me. 
JHN.17.26	 I have made your name known to them, and I will make it known so that the love you have for me will be in them and I will be in them.”
JHN.18.1	 After Jesus finished his prayer, he went with his disciples to the other side of the Kidron Valley. They entered the garden that was there.
JHN.18.2	 Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place because Jesus and his disciples often gathered there. 
JHN.18.3	 So Judas took a troop of soldiers and the guards from the chief priests and Pharisees and went to the garden. They were carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons.
JHN.18.4	 Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him. So he went to meet them and asked, “Who are you looking for?”
JHN.18.5	 They answered him, “Jesus from Nazareth.”
JHN.18.5	Jesus told them, “I am he.”
JHN.18.5	Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with the crowd. 
JHN.18.6	 When Jesus told them, “I am he,” the crowd backed away and fell to the ground.
JHN.18.7	 Jesus asked them again, “Who are you looking for?”
JHN.18.7	They said, “Jesus from Nazareth.”
JHN.18.8	 Jesus replied, “I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these other men go.” 
JHN.18.9	 In this way what Jesus had said came true: “I lost none of those you gave me.”
JHN.18.10	 Simon Peter had a sword. He drew it, attacked the chief priest’s servant, and cut off the servant’s right ear. (The servant’s name was Malchus.)
JHN.18.11	 Jesus told Peter, “Put your sword away. Shouldn’t I drink the cup ⌊of suffering⌋ that my Father has given me?”
JHN.18.12	 Then the army officer and the Jewish guards arrested Jesus. They tied Jesus up 
JHN.18.13	 and took him first to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas. Caiaphas, the chief priest that year, 
JHN.18.14	 was the person who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one man die for the people.
JHN.18.15	 Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. The other disciple was well-known to the chief priest. So that disciple went with Jesus into the chief priest’s courtyard. 
JHN.18.16	 Peter, however, was standing outside the gate. The other disciple talked to the woman who was the gatekeeper and brought Peter into the courtyard.
JHN.18.17	 The gatekeeper asked Peter, “Aren’t you one of this man’s disciples too?”
JHN.18.17	Peter answered, “No, I’m not!”
JHN.18.18	 The servants and the guards were standing around a fire they had built and were warming themselves because it was cold. Peter was standing there, too, and warming himself with the others.
JHN.18.19	 The chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teachings.
JHN.18.20	 Jesus answered him, “I have spoken publicly for everyone to hear. I have always taught in synagogues or in the temple courtyard, where all the Jews gather. I haven’t said anything in secret. 
JHN.18.21	 Why do you question me? Question those who heard what I said to them. They know what I’ve said.”
JHN.18.22	 When Jesus said this, one of the guards standing near Jesus slapped his face and said, “Is that how you answer the chief priest?”
JHN.18.23	 Jesus replied to him, “If I’ve said anything wrong, tell me what it was. But if I’ve told the truth, why do you hit me?”
JHN.18.24	 Annas sent Jesus to Caiaphas, the chief priest. Jesus was still tied up.
JHN.18.25	 Simon Peter continued to stand and warm himself by the fire. Some men asked him, “Aren’t you, too, one of his disciples?”
JHN.18.25	Peter denied it by saying, “No, I’m not!”
JHN.18.26	 One of the chief priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked him, “Didn’t I see you with Jesus in the garden?”
JHN.18.27	 Peter again denied it, and just then a rooster crowed.
JHN.18.28	 Early in the morning, Jesus was taken from Caiaphas’ house to the governor’s palace.
JHN.18.28	The Jews wouldn’t go into the palace. They didn’t want to become unclean,
JHN.18.29	 So Pilate came out to them and asked, “What accusation are you making against this man?”
JHN.18.30	 The Jews answered Pilate, “If he weren’t a criminal, we wouldn’t have handed him over to you.”
JHN.18.31	 Pilate told the Jews, “Take him, and try him by your law.”
JHN.18.31	The Jews answered him, “We’re not allowed to execute anyone.” 
JHN.18.32	 In this way what Jesus had predicted about how he would die came true.
JHN.18.33	 Pilate went back into the palace, called for Jesus, and asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
JHN.18.34	 Jesus replied, “Did you think of that yourself, or did others tell you about me?”
JHN.18.35	 Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your own people and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?”
JHN.18.36	 Jesus answered, “My kingdom doesn’t belong to this world. If my kingdom belonged to this world, my followers would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. My kingdom doesn’t have its origin on earth.”
JHN.18.37	 Pilate asked him, “So you are a king?”
JHN.18.37	Jesus replied, “You’re correct in saying that I’m a king. I have been born and have come into the world for this reason: to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to me.”
JHN.18.38	 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”
JHN.18.38	After Pilate said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, “I don’t find this man guilty of anything. 
JHN.18.39	 You have a custom that I should free one person for you at Passover. Would you like me to free the king of the Jews for you?”
JHN.18.40	 The Jews shouted again, “Don’t free this man! Free Barabbas!” (Barabbas was a political revolutionary.)
JHN.19.1	 Then Pilate had Jesus taken away and whipped. 
JHN.19.2	 The soldiers twisted some thorny branches into a crown, placed it on his head, and put a purple cape on him. 
JHN.19.3	 They went up to him, said, “Long live the king of the Jews!” and slapped his face.
JHN.19.4	 Pilate went outside again and told the Jews, “I’m bringing him out to you to let you know that I don’t find this man guilty of anything.” 
JHN.19.5	 Jesus went outside. He was wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cape. Pilate said to the Jews, “Look, here’s the man!”
JHN.19.6	 When the chief priests and the guards saw Jesus, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
JHN.19.6	Pilate told them, “You take him and crucify him. I don’t find this man guilty of anything.”
JHN.19.7	 The Jews answered Pilate, “We have a law, and by that law he must die because he claimed to be the Son of God.”
JHN.19.8	 When Pilate heard them say that, he became more afraid than ever. 
JHN.19.9	 He went into the palace again and asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus didn’t answer him.
JHN.19.10	 So Pilate said to Jesus, “Aren’t you going to answer me? Don’t you know that I have the authority to free you or to crucify you?”
JHN.19.11	 Jesus answered Pilate, “You wouldn’t have any authority over me if it hadn’t been given to you from above. That’s why the man who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.”
JHN.19.12	 When Pilate heard what Jesus said, he wanted to free him. But the Jews shouted, “If you free this man, you’re not a friend of the emperor. Anyone who claims to be a king is defying the emperor.”
JHN.19.13	 When Pilate heard what they said, he took Jesus outside and sat on the judge’s seat in a place called Stone Pavement. (In Hebrew it is called 
JHN.19.14	 The time was about six o’clock in the morning on the Friday of the Passover festival.
JHN.19.14	Pilate said to the Jews, “Look, here’s your king!”
JHN.19.15	 Then the Jews shouted, “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!”
JHN.19.15	Pilate asked them, “Should I crucify your king?”
JHN.19.15	The chief priests responded, “The emperor is the only king we have!”
JHN.19.16	 Then Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be crucified.
JHN.19.16	So the soldiers took Jesus. 
JHN.19.17	 He carried his own cross and went out ⌊of the city⌋ to a location called The Skull. (In Hebrew this place is called 
JHN.19.18	 The soldiers crucified Jesus and two other men there. Jesus was in the middle.
JHN.19.19	 Pilate wrote a notice and put it on the cross. The notice read, “Jesus from Nazareth, the king of the Jews.” 
JHN.19.20	 Many Jews read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. The notice was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
JHN.19.21	 The chief priests of the Jewish people told Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The king of the Jews!’ Instead, write, ‘He said that he is the king of the Jews.’ ”
JHN.19.22	 Pilate replied, “I have written what I’ve written.”
JHN.19.23	 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them four ways so that each soldier could have a share. His robe was left over. It didn’t have a seam because it had been woven in one piece from top to bottom. 
JHN.19.24	 The soldiers said to each other, “Let’s not rip it apart. Let’s throw dice to see who will get it.” In this way the Scripture came true: “They divided my clothes among themselves. They threw dice for my clothing.” So that’s what the soldiers did.
JHN.19.25	 Jesus’ mother, her sister, Mary (the wife of Clopas), and Mary from Magdala were standing beside Jesus’ cross. 
JHN.19.26	 Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there. He said to his mother, “Look, here’s your son!” 
JHN.19.27	 Then he said to the disciple, “Look, here’s your mother!”
JHN.19.27	From that time on she lived with that disciple in his home.
JHN.19.28	 After this, when Jesus knew that everything had now been finished, he said, “I’m thirsty.” He said this so that Scripture could finally be concluded.
JHN.19.29	 A jar filled with vinegar was there. So the soldiers put a sponge soaked in the vinegar on a hyssop stick and held it to his mouth.
JHN.19.30	 After Jesus had taken the vinegar, he said, “It is finished!”
JHN.19.30	Then he bowed his head and died.
JHN.19.31	 Since it was Friday and the next day was an especially important day of worship, the Jews didn’t want the bodies to stay on the crosses. So they asked Pilate to have the men’s legs broken and their bodies removed. 
JHN.19.32	 The soldiers broke the legs of the first man and then of the other man who had been crucified with Jesus.
JHN.19.33	 When the soldiers came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they didn’t break his legs. 
JHN.19.34	 However, one of the soldiers stabbed Jesus’ side with his spear, and blood and water immediately came out. 
JHN.19.35	 The one who saw this is an eyewitness. What he says is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth so that you, too, will believe.
JHN.19.36	 This happened so that the Scripture would come true: “None of his bones will be broken.” 
JHN.19.37	 Another Scripture passage says, “They will look at the person whom they have stabbed.”
JHN.19.38	 Later Joseph from the city of Arimathea asked Pilate to let him remove Jesus’ body. (Joseph was a disciple of Jesus but secretly because he was afraid of the Jews). Pilate gave him permission to remove Jesus’ body. So Joseph removed it. 
JHN.19.39	 Nicodemus, the one who had first come to Jesus at night, went with Joseph and brought 75 pounds of a myrrh and aloe mixture.
JHN.19.40	 These two men took the body of Jesus and bound it with strips of linen. They laced the strips with spices. This was the Jewish custom for burial.
JHN.19.41	 A garden was located in the place where Jesus was crucified. In that garden was a new tomb in which no one had yet been placed. 
JHN.19.42	 Joseph and Nicodemus put Jesus in that tomb, since that day was the Jewish day of preparation and since the tomb was nearby.
JHN.20.1	 Early on Sunday morning, while it was still dark, Mary from Magdala went to the tomb. She saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb’s entrance. 
JHN.20.2	 So she ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus loved. She told them, “They have removed the Lord from the tomb, and we don’t know where they’ve put him.”
JHN.20.3	 So Peter and the other disciple headed for the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	 The two were running side by side, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and came to the tomb first. 
JHN.20.5	 He bent over and looked inside the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there but didn’t go inside.
JHN.20.6	 Simon Peter arrived after him and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there. 
JHN.20.7	 He also saw the cloth that had been on Jesus’ head. It wasn’t lying with the strips of linen but was rolled up separately. 
JHN.20.8	 Then the other disciple, who arrived at the tomb first, went inside. He saw and believed. 
JHN.20.9	 They didn’t know yet what Scripture meant when it said that Jesus had to come back to life. 
JHN.20.10	 So the disciples went back home.
JHN.20.11	 Mary, however, stood there and cried as she looked at the tomb. As she cried, she bent over and looked inside. 
JHN.20.12	 She saw two angels in white clothes. They were sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying. One angel was where Jesus’ head had been, and the other was where his feet had been. 
JHN.20.13	 The angels asked her why she was crying.
JHN.20.13	Mary told them, “They have removed my Lord, and I don’t know where they’ve put him.”
JHN.20.14	 After she said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there. However, she didn’t know that it was Jesus. 
JHN.20.15	 Jesus asked her, “Why are you crying? Who are you looking for?”
JHN.20.15	Mary thought it was the gardener speaking to her. So she said to him, “Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I’ll remove him.”
JHN.20.16	 Jesus said to her, “Mary!”
JHN.20.16	Mary turned around and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (This word means “teacher.”)
JHN.20.17	 Jesus told her, “Don’t hold on to me. I have not yet gone to the Father. But go to my brothers and sisters and tell them, ‘I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’ ”
JHN.20.18	 Mary from Magdala went to the disciples and told them, “I have seen the Lord.” She also told them what he had said to her.
JHN.20.19	 That Sunday evening, the disciples were together behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jews. Jesus stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you!” 
JHN.20.20	 When he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were glad to see the Lord.
JHN.20.21	 Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, so I am sending you.” 
JHN.20.22	 After he had said this, he breathed on the disciples and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. 
JHN.20.23	 Whenever you forgive sins, they are forgiven. Whenever you don’t forgive them, they are not forgiven.”
JHN.20.24	 Thomas, one of the twelve apostles, who was called Didymus, wasn’t with them when Jesus came. 
JHN.20.25	 The other disciples told him, “We’ve seen the Lord.”
JHN.20.25	Thomas told them, “I refuse to believe this unless I see the nail marks in his hands, put my fingers into them, and put my hand into his side.”
JHN.20.26	 A week later Jesus’ disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were locked, Jesus stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” 
JHN.20.27	 Then Jesus said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Take your hand, and put it into my side. Stop doubting, and believe.”
JHN.20.28	 Thomas responded to Jesus, “My Lord and my God!”
JHN.20.29	 Jesus said to Thomas, “You believe because you’ve seen me. Blessed are those who haven’t seen me but believe.”
JHN.20.30	 Jesus performed many other miracles that his disciples saw. Those miracles are not written in this book. 
JHN.20.31	 But these miracles have been written so that you will believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and so that you will have life by believing in him.
JHN.21.1	 Later, by the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples. This is what happened. 
JHN.21.2	 Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus were together. 
JHN.21.3	 Simon Peter said to the others, “I’m going fishing.”
JHN.21.3	They told him, “We’re going with you.”
JHN.21.3	They went out in a boat but didn’t catch a thing that night. 
JHN.21.4	 As the sun was rising, Jesus stood on the shore. The disciples didn’t realize that it was Jesus.
JHN.21.5	 Jesus asked them, “Friends, haven’t you caught any fish?”
JHN.21.5	They answered him, “No, we haven’t.”
JHN.21.6	 He told them, “Throw the net out on the right side of the boat, and you’ll catch some.” So they threw the net out and were unable to pull it in because so many fish were in it.
JHN.21.7	 The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord.” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put back on the clothes that he had taken off and jumped into the sea. 
JHN.21.8	 The other disciples came with the boat and dragged the net full of fish. They weren’t far from the shore, only about 100 yards.
JHN.21.9	 When they went ashore, they saw a fire with a fish lying on the coals, and they saw a loaf of bread.
JHN.21.10	 Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish you’ve just caught.” 
JHN.21.11	 Simon Peter got into the boat and pulled the net ashore. Though the net was filled with 153 large fish, it was not torn.
JHN.21.12	 Jesus told them, “Come, have breakfast.” None of the disciples dared to ask him who he was. They knew he was the Lord. 
JHN.21.13	 Jesus took the bread, gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.
JHN.21.14	 This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had come back to life.
JHN.21.15	 After they had eaten breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the other disciples do?”
JHN.21.15	Peter answered him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”
JHN.21.15	Jesus told him, “Feed my lambs.”
JHN.21.16	 Jesus asked him again, a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”
JHN.21.16	Peter answered him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”
JHN.21.16	Jesus told him, “Take care of my sheep.”
JHN.21.17	 Jesus asked him a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”
JHN.21.17	Peter felt sad because Jesus had asked him a third time, “Do you love me?” So Peter said to him, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you.”
JHN.21.17	Jesus told him, “Feed my sheep. 
JHN.21.18	 I can guarantee this truth: When you were young, you would get ready to go where you wanted. But when you’re old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will get you ready to take you where you don’t want to go.” 
JHN.21.19	 Jesus said this to show by what kind of death Peter would bring glory to God. After saying this, Jesus told Peter, “Follow me!”
JHN.21.20	 Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved. That disciple was following them. He was the one who leaned against Jesus’ chest at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?” 
JHN.21.21	 When Peter saw him, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”
JHN.21.22	 Jesus said to Peter, “If I want him to live until I come again, how does that concern you? Follow me!” 
JHN.21.23	 So a rumor that that disciple wouldn’t die spread among Jesus’ followers. But Jesus didn’t say that he wouldn’t die. What Jesus said was, “If I want him to live until I come again, how does that concern you?”
JHN.21.24	 This disciple was an eyewitness of these things and wrote them down. We know that what he says is true.
JHN.21.25	 Jesus also did many other things. If every one of them were written down, I suppose the world wouldn’t have enough room for the books that would be written.
ACT.1.1	 In my first book, Theophilus, I wrote about what Jesus began to do and teach. This included everything from the beginning ⌊of his life⌋ 
ACT.1.2	 until the day he was taken to heaven. Before he was taken to heaven, he gave instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles, whom he had chosen.
ACT.1.3	 After his death Jesus showed the apostles a lot of convincing evidence that he was alive. For 40 days he appeared to them and talked with them about the kingdom of God.
ACT.1.4	 Once, while he was meeting with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait there for what the Father had promised. Jesus said to them, “I’ve told you what the Father promises: 
ACT.1.5	 John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.1.6	 So when the apostles came together, they asked him, “Lord, is this the time when you’re going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”
ACT.1.7	 Jesus told them, “You don’t need to know about times or periods that the Father has determined by his own authority. 
ACT.1.8	 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes to you. Then you will be my witnesses to testify about me in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
ACT.1.9	 After he had said this, he was taken to heaven. A cloud hid him so that they could no longer see him.
ACT.1.10	 They were staring into the sky as he departed. Suddenly, two men in white clothes stood near them. 
ACT.1.11	 They asked, “Why are you men from Galilee standing here looking at the sky? Jesus, who was taken from you to heaven, will come back in the same way that you saw him go to heaven.”
ACT.1.12	 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Mount of Olives. It is near Jerusalem, about half a mile away.
ACT.1.13	 When they came into the city, Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon the Zealot, and Judas (son of James) went to the second-story room where they were staying.
ACT.1.14	 The apostles had a single purpose as they devoted themselves to prayer. They were joined by some women, including Mary (the mother of Jesus), and they were joined by his brothers.
ACT.1.15	 At a time when about 120 disciples had gathered together, Peter got up and spoke to them.
ACT.1.15	He said, 
ACT.1.16	 “Brothers, what the Holy Spirit predicted through David in Scripture about Judas had to come true. Judas led the men to arrest Jesus. 
ACT.1.17	 He had been one of us and had been given an active role in this ministry. 
ACT.1.18	 With the money he received from the wrong he had done, he bought a piece of land where he fell headfirst to his death. His body split open, and all his internal organs came out. 
ACT.1.19	 Everyone living in Jerusalem knows about this. They even call that piece of land 
ACT.1.20	 You’ve read in Psalms, ‘Let his home be deserted, and let no one live there,’ and ‘Let someone else take his position.’”
ACT.1.20	“Therefore, someone must be added to our number to serve with us as a witness that Jesus came back to life. 
ACT.1.21	 He must be one of the men who accompanied Jesus with us the entire time that the Lord Jesus was among us. 
ACT.1.22	 This person must have been with us from the time that John was baptizing people to the day that Jesus was taken from us.” 
ACT.1.23	 The disciples determined that two men were qualified. These men were Joseph (who was called Barsabbas and was also known as Justus) and Matthias. 
ACT.1.24	 Then they prayed, “Lord, you know everyone’s thoughts. Show us which of these two you have chosen. 
ACT.1.25	 Show us who is to take the place of Judas as an apostle, since Judas abandoned his position to go to the place where he belongs.”
ACT.1.26	 They drew names to choose an apostle. Matthias was chosen and joined the eleven apostles.
ACT.2.1	 When Pentecost, the fiftieth day after Passover, came, all the believers were together in one place. 
ACT.2.2	 Suddenly, a sound like a violently blowing wind came from the sky and filled the whole house where they were staying. 
ACT.2.3	 Tongues that looked like fire appeared to them. The tongues arranged themselves so that one came to rest on each believer. 
ACT.2.4	 All the believers were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.
ACT.2.5	 Devout Jewish men from every nation were living in Jerusalem. 
ACT.2.6	 They gathered when they heard the wind. Each person was startled to recognize his own dialect when the disciples spoke.
ACT.2.7	 Stunned and amazed, the people in the crowd said, “All of these men who are speaking are Galileans. 
ACT.2.8	 Why do we hear them speaking in our native dialects? 
ACT.2.9	 We’re Parthians, Medes, and Elamites. We’re people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, the province of Asia, 
ACT.2.10	 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the country near Cyrene in Libya. We’re Jewish people, converts to Judaism, and visitors from Rome, 
ACT.2.11	 Crete, and Arabia. We hear these men in our own languages as they tell about the miracles that God has done.”
ACT.2.12	 All of these devout men were stunned and puzzled. They asked each other, “What can this mean?” 
ACT.2.13	 Others said jokingly, “They’re drunk on sweet wine.”
ACT.2.14	 Then Peter stood up with the eleven apostles. In a loud voice he said to them, “Men of Judea and everyone living in Jerusalem! You must understand this, so pay attention to what I say. 
ACT.2.15	 These men are not drunk as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning. 
ACT.2.16	 Rather, this is what the prophet Joel spoke about:
ACT.2.17	 ‘In the last days, God says,
ACT.2.17	I will pour my Spirit on everyone.
ACT.2.17	Your sons and daughters will speak what God has revealed.
ACT.2.17	Your young men will see visions.
ACT.2.17	Your old men will dream dreams.
ACT.2.18	 In those days
ACT.2.18	I will pour my Spirit on my servants, on both men and women.
ACT.2.18	They will speak what God has revealed.
ACT.2.19	 I will work miracles in the sky and give signs on the earth:
ACT.2.19	blood, fire, and clouds of smoke.
ACT.2.20	 The sun will become dark,
ACT.2.20	and the moon will become as red as blood
ACT.2.20	before the terrifying day of the Lord comes.
ACT.2.21	 Then whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’
ACT.2.22	 “Men of Israel, listen to what I say: Jesus from Nazareth was a man whom God brought to your attention. You know that through this man God worked miracles, did amazing things, and gave signs. 
ACT.2.23	 By using men who don’t acknowledge Moses’ Teachings, you crucified Jesus, who was given over ⌊to death⌋ by a plan that God had determined in advance. 
ACT.2.24	 But God brought him from death back to life and destroyed the pains of death, because death had no power to hold him. 
ACT.2.25	 This is what David meant when he said about Jesus:
ACT.2.25	‘I always see the Lord in front of me.
ACT.2.25	I cannot be moved because he is by my side.
ACT.2.26	 That is why my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices.
ACT.2.26	My body also rests securely
ACT.2.27	 because you do not abandon my soul to the grave
ACT.2.27	or allow your holy one to decay.
ACT.2.28	 You make the path of life known to me.
ACT.2.28	In your presence there is complete joy.’
ACT.2.29	 “Brothers, I can tell you confidently that our ancestor David died and was buried and that his tomb is here to this day. 
ACT.2.30	 David was a prophet and knew that God had promised with an oath that he would place one of David’s descendants on his throne. 
ACT.2.31	 David knew that the Messiah would come back to life, and he spoke about that before it ever happened. He said that the Messiah wouldn’t be left in the grave and that his body wouldn’t decay.
ACT.2.32	 “God brought this man Jesus back to life. We are all witnesses to that. 
ACT.2.33	 God used his power to give Jesus the highest position. Jesus has also received and has poured out the Holy Spirit as the Father had promised, and this is what you’re seeing and hearing. 
ACT.2.34	 David didn’t go up to heaven, but he said,
ACT.2.34	‘The Lord said to my Lord,
ACT.2.34	“Take my highest position of power
ACT.2.35	 until I put your enemies under your control.” ’
ACT.2.36	 “All the people of Israel should know beyond a doubt that God made Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.”
ACT.2.37	 When the people heard this, they were deeply upset. They asked Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”
ACT.2.38	 Peter answered them, “All of you must turn to God and change the way you think and act, and each of you must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins will be forgiven. Then you will receive the Holy Spirit as a gift. 
ACT.2.39	 This promise belongs to you and to your children and to everyone who is far away. It belongs to everyone who worships the Lord our God.”
ACT.2.40	 Peter said much more to warn them. He urged, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.” 
ACT.2.41	 Those who accepted what Peter said were baptized. That day about 3,000 people were added ⌊to the group⌋.
ACT.2.42	 The disciples were devoted to the teachings of the apostles, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer. 
ACT.2.43	 A feeling of fear came over everyone as many amazing things and miraculous signs happened through the apostles. 
ACT.2.44	 All the believers kept meeting together, and they shared everything with each other. 
ACT.2.45	 From time to time, they sold their property and other possessions and distributed the money to anyone who needed it. 
ACT.2.46	 The believers had a single purpose and went to the temple every day. They were joyful and humble as they ate at each other’s homes and shared their food. 
ACT.2.47	 At the same time, they praised God and had the good will of all the people. Every day the Lord saved people, and they were added to the group.
ACT.3.1	 Peter and John were going to the temple courtyard for the three o’clock prayer. 
ACT.3.2	 At the same time, a man who had been lame from birth was being carried by some men. Every day these men would put the lame man at a gate in the temple courtyard. The gate was called Beautiful Gate. There he would beg for handouts from people going into the courtyard. 
ACT.3.3	 When the man saw that Peter and John were about to go into the courtyard, he asked them for a handout.
ACT.3.4	 Peter and John stared at him. “Look at us!” Peter said. 
ACT.3.5	 So the man watched them closely. He expected to receive something from them. 
ACT.3.6	 However, Peter said to him, “I don’t have any money, but I’ll give you what I do have. Through the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, walk!” 
ACT.3.7	 Peter took hold of the man’s right hand and began to help him up. Immediately, the man’s feet and ankles became strong. 
ACT.3.8	 Springing to his feet, he stood up and started to walk. He went with Peter and John into the temple courtyard. The man was walking, jumping, and praising God.
ACT.3.9	 All the people saw him walking and praising God. 
ACT.3.10	 They knew that he was the man who used to sit and beg at the temple’s Beautiful Gate. The people were amazed and stunned to see what had happened to him. 
ACT.3.11	 They were excited, and everyone ran to see them at the place called Solomon’s Porch. The man wouldn’t let go of Peter and John.
ACT.3.12	 When Peter saw this, he said to the people, “Men of Israel, why are you amazed about this man? Why are you staring at us as though we have made him walk by our own power or godly life? 
ACT.3.13	 The God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed Jesus over to Pilate. You rejected him in Pilate’s presence, even though Pilate had decided to let him go free. 
ACT.3.14	 You rejected the man who was holy and innocent. You asked to have a murderer given to you, 
ACT.3.15	 and you killed the source of life. But God brought him back to life, and we are witnesses to that. 
ACT.3.16	 We believe in the one named Jesus. Through his power alone this man, whom you know, was healed, as all of you saw.
ACT.3.17	 “And now, brothers, I know that like your rulers you didn’t know what you were doing. 
ACT.3.18	 But in this way God made the sufferings of his Messiah come true. God had predicted these sufferings through all the prophets. 
ACT.3.19	 So change the way you think and act, and turn ⌊to God⌋ to have your sins removed. 
ACT.3.20	 Then times will come when the Lord will refresh you. He will send you Jesus, whom he has appointed to be the Christ. 
ACT.3.21	 Heaven must receive Jesus until the time when everything will be restored as God promised through his holy prophets long ago.
ACT.3.22	 “Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will send you a prophet, an Israelite like me. Listen to everything he tells you. 
ACT.3.23	 Those who won’t listen to that prophet will be excluded from the people.’ 
ACT.3.24	 Samuel and all the prophets who followed him spoke about these days. 
ACT.3.25	 You are the descendants of the prophets and the heirs of the promise 
ACT.3.26	 God has brought his servant back to life and has sent him to you first. God did this to bless you by turning every one of you from your evil ways.”
ACT.4.1	 Some priests, the officer in charge of the temple guards, and some Sadducees approached Peter and John while they were speaking to the people. 
ACT.4.2	 These religious authorities were greatly annoyed. Peter and John were teaching the people and spreading the message that the dead will come back to life through Jesus. 
ACT.4.3	 So the temple guards arrested them. Since it was already evening, they put Peter and John in jail until the next day.
ACT.4.4	 But many of those who had heard the message became believers, so the number of men who believed grew to about 5,000.
ACT.4.5	 The next day the Jewish rulers, the leaders, and the experts in Moses’ Teachings met in Jerusalem. 
ACT.4.6	 The chief priest Annas, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the rest of the chief priest’s family were present. 
ACT.4.7	 They made Peter and John stand in front of them and then asked, “By what power or in whose name did you do this?”
ACT.4.8	 Then Peter, because he was filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers and leaders of the people, 
ACT.4.9	 today you are cross-examining us about the good we did for a crippled man. You want to know how he was made well. 
ACT.4.10	 You and all the people of Israel must understand that this man stands in your presence with a healthy body because of the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth. You crucified Jesus Christ, but God has brought him back to life. 
ACT.4.11	 He is the stone that the builders rejected, the stone that has become the cornerstone. 
ACT.4.12	 No one else can save us. Indeed, we can be saved only by the power of the one named Jesus and not by any other person.”
ACT.4.13	 After they found out that Peter and John had no education or special training, they were surprised to see how boldly they spoke. They realized that these men had been with Jesus. 
ACT.4.14	 When they saw the man who was healed standing with Peter and John, they couldn’t say anything against the two apostles. 
ACT.4.15	 So they ordered Peter and John to leave the council room and began to discuss the matter among themselves. 
ACT.4.16	 They said, “What should we do to these men? Clearly, they’ve performed a miracle that everyone in Jerusalem knows about. We can’t deny that. 
ACT.4.17	 So let’s threaten them. Let’s tell them that they must never speak to anyone about the one named Jesus. Then the news about the miracle that they have performed will not spread any further among the people.”
ACT.4.18	 They called Peter and John and ordered them never to teach about Jesus or even mention his name.
ACT.4.19	 Peter and John answered them, “Decide for yourselves whether God wants people to listen to you rather than to him. 
ACT.4.20	 We cannot stop talking about what we’ve seen and heard.”
ACT.4.21	 The authorities threatened them even more and then let them go. Since all the people were praising God for what had happened, the authorities couldn’t find any way to punish Peter and John. 
ACT.4.22	 (The man who was healed by this miracle was over 40 years old.)
ACT.4.23	 When Peter and John were released, they went to the other apostles and told them everything the chief priests and leaders had said. 
ACT.4.24	 When the apostles heard this, they were united and loudly prayed to God, “Master, you made the sky, the land, the sea, and everything in them. 
ACT.4.25	 You said through the Holy Spirit, who spoke through your servant David (our ancestor),
ACT.4.25	‘Why do the nations act arrogantly?
ACT.4.25	Why do their people devise useless plots?
ACT.4.26	 Kings take their stand.
ACT.4.26	Rulers make plans together
ACT.4.26	against the Lord and against his Messiah.’
ACT.4.27	 “In this city Herod and Pontius Pilate made plans together with non-Jewish people and the people of Israel. They made their plans against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. 
ACT.4.28	 Through your will and power, they did everything that you had already decided should be done.
ACT.4.29	 “Lord, pay attention to their threats now, and allow us to speak your word boldly. 
ACT.4.30	 Show your power by healing, performing miracles, and doing amazing things through the power and the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
ACT.4.31	 When the apostles had finished praying, their meeting place shook. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God boldly.
ACT.4.32	 The whole group of believers lived in harmony. No one called any of his possessions his own. Instead, they shared everything.
ACT.4.33	 With great power the apostles continued to testify that the Lord Jesus had come back to life. ⌊God’s⌋ abundant good will 
ACT.4.34	 None of them needed anything. From time to time, people sold land or houses and brought the money 
ACT.4.35	 to the apostles. Then the money was distributed to anyone who needed it.
ACT.4.36	 Joseph, a descendant of Levi, had been born on the island of Cyprus. The apostles called him Barnabas, which means “a person who encourages.” 
ACT.4.37	 He had some land. He sold it and turned the money over to the apostles.
ACT.5.1	 A man named Ananias and his wife Sapphira sold some property. 
ACT.5.2	 They agreed to hold back some of the money ⌊they had pledged⌋ and turned only part of it over to the apostles.
ACT.5.3	 Peter asked, “Ananias, why did you let Satan fill you with the idea that you could deceive the Holy Spirit? You’ve held back some of the money you received for the land. 
ACT.5.4	 While you had the land, it was your own. After it was sold, you could have done as you pleased with the money. So how could you do a thing like this? You didn’t lie to people but to God!”
ACT.5.5	 When Ananias heard Peter say this, he dropped dead. Everyone who heard about his death was terrified. 
ACT.5.6	 Some young men got up, wrapped his body in a sheet, carried him outside, and buried him.
ACT.5.7	 About three hours later Ananias’ wife arrived. She didn’t know what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	 So Peter asked her, “Tell me, did you sell the land for that price?”
ACT.5.8	She answered, “Yes, that was the price.”
ACT.5.9	 Then Peter said to her, “How could you and your husband agree to test the Lord’s Spirit? Those who buried your husband are standing at the door, and they will carry you outside for burial.”
ACT.5.10	 Immediately, she dropped dead in front of Peter. When the young men came back, they found Sapphira dead. So they carried her outside and buried her next to her husband. 
ACT.5.11	 The whole church and everyone else who heard about what had happened were terrified.
ACT.5.12	 The people saw the apostles perform many miracles and do amazing things. The believers had a common faith in Jesus as they met on Solomon’s Porch. 
ACT.5.13	 None of the other people dared to join them, although everyone spoke highly of them. 
ACT.5.14	 More men and women than ever began to believe in the Lord. 
ACT.5.15	 As a result, people carried their sick into the streets. They placed them on stretchers and cots so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some sick people as he went by. 
ACT.5.16	 Crowds from the cities around Jerusalem would gather. They would bring their sick and those who were troubled by evil spirits, and each person was cured.
ACT.5.17	 The chief priest and the whole party of the Sadducees who were with him were extremely jealous. So they took action 
ACT.5.18	 by arresting the apostles and putting them in the city jail. 
ACT.5.19	 But at night an angel from the Lord opened the doors to their cell and led them out of the prison. 
ACT.5.20	 The angel told them, “Stand in the temple courtyard, and tell the people everything about life ⌊in Christ⌋.”
ACT.5.21	 Early in the morning, after they had listened to the angel, the apostles went into the temple courtyard and began to teach.
ACT.5.21	The chief priest and those who were with him called together the Jewish council, that is, all the leaders of Israel. They also sent men to the prison to get the apostles. 
ACT.5.22	 When the temple guards arrived at the prison, they didn’t find the apostles. The guards came back and reported, 
ACT.5.23	 “We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors. However, when we opened the doors, we found no one inside.” 
ACT.5.24	 When the officer of the temple guards and the chief priests heard this, they were puzzled about what could have happened.
ACT.5.25	 Then someone told them, “The men you put in prison are standing in the temple courtyard. They’re teaching the people.”
ACT.5.26	 Then the officer of the temple guards went with some of his men to bring back the apostles without using force. After all, the officer and his guards were afraid that the people would stone them to death for using force. 
ACT.5.27	 When they brought back the apostles, they made them stand in front of the council. The chief priest questioned them. 
ACT.5.28	 He said, “We gave you strict orders not to mention Jesus’ name when you teach. Yet, you’ve filled Jerusalem with your teachings. You want to take revenge on us for putting that man to death.”
ACT.5.29	 Peter and the other apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than people. 
ACT.5.30	 You murdered Jesus by hanging him on a cross. But the God of our ancestors brought him back to life. 
ACT.5.31	 God used his power to give Jesus the highest position as leader and savior. He did this to lead the people of Israel to him, to change the way they think and act, and to forgive their sins. 
ACT.5.32	 We are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”
ACT.5.33	 When the men on the council heard this, they became furious and wanted to execute the apostles. 
ACT.5.34	 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel stood up. He was a highly respected expert in Moses’ Teachings. He ordered that the apostles should be taken outside for a little while.
ACT.5.35	 Then he said to the council, “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you do with these men. 
ACT.5.36	 Some time ago Theudas appeared. He claimed that he was important, and about four hundred men joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were scattered. The whole movement was a failure.
ACT.5.37	 “After that man, at the time of the census, Judas from Galilee appeared and led people in a revolt. He, too, died, and all his followers were scattered.
ACT.5.38	 “We should keep away from these men for now. We should leave them alone. I can guarantee that if the plan they put into action is of human origin, it will fail. 
ACT.5.39	 However, if it’s from God, you won’t be able to stop them. You may even discover that you’re fighting against God.”
ACT.5.40	 The council took his advice. They called the apostles, beat them, ordered them not to speak about the one named Jesus, and let them go.
ACT.5.41	 The apostles left the council room. They were happy to have been considered worthy to suffer dishonor for speaking about Jesus. 
ACT.5.42	 Every day in the temple courtyard and from house to house, they refused to stop teaching and telling the Good News that Jesus is the Messiah.
ACT.6.1	 At that time, as the number of disciples grew, Greek-speaking Jews complained about the Hebrew-speaking Jews. The Greek-speaking Jews claimed that the widows among them were neglected every day when food and other assistance was distributed.
ACT.6.2	 The twelve apostles called all the disciples together and told them, “It’s not right for us to give up God’s word in order to distribute food. 
ACT.6.3	 So, brothers and sisters, choose seven men whom the people know are spiritually wise. We will put them in charge of this problem. 
ACT.6.4	 However, we will devote ourselves to praying and to serving in ways that are related to the word.”
ACT.6.5	 The suggestion pleased the whole group. So they chose Stephen, who was a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and they chose Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nic o laus, who had converted to Judaism in the city of Antioch. 
ACT.6.6	 The disciples had these men stand in front of the apostles, who prayed and placed their hands on these seven men.
ACT.6.7	 The word of God continued to spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem grew very large. A large number of priests accepted the faith.
ACT.6.8	 Stephen was a man filled with God’s favor 
ACT.6.9	 ⌊One day⌋ some men from the cities of Cyrene and Alexandria and the provinces of Cilicia and Asia started an argument with Stephen. They belonged to a synagogue called Freedmen’s Synagogue. 
ACT.6.10	 They couldn’t argue with Stephen because he spoke with the wisdom that the Spirit had given him. 
ACT.6.11	 Then they bribed some men to lie.
ACT.6.11	These men said, “We heard him slander Moses and God.” 
ACT.6.12	 The liars stirred up trouble among the people, the leaders, and the experts in Moses’ Teachings. So they went to Stephen, took him by force, and brought him in front of the Jewish council. 
ACT.6.13	 Some witnesses stood up and lied about Stephen. They said, “This man never stops saying bad things about the holy place and Moses’ Teachings. 
ACT.6.14	 We heard him say that Jesus from Nazareth will destroy the temple and change the customs that Moses gave us.”
ACT.6.15	 Everyone who sat in the council stared at him and saw that his face looked like an angel’s face.
ACT.7.1	 Then the chief priest asked Stephen, “Is this true?”
ACT.7.2	 Stephen answered, “Brothers and fathers, listen to me. The God who reveals his glory appeared to our ancestor Abraham in Mesopotamia. This happened before Abraham lived in Haran. 
ACT.7.3	 God told him, ‘Leave your land and your relatives. Go to the land that I will show you.’
ACT.7.4	 “Then Abraham left the country of Chaldea and lived in the city of Haran. After his father died, God made him move from there to this land where we now live.
ACT.7.5	 “Yet, God didn’t give Abraham anything in this land to call his own, not even a place to rest his feet. But God promised to give this land to him and to his descendants, even though Abraham didn’t have a child. 
ACT.7.6	 God told Abraham that his descendants would be foreigners living in another country and that the people there would make them slaves and mistreat them for 400 years. 
ACT.7.7	 God also told him, ‘I will punish the people whom they will serve. After that, they will leave that country and worship me here.’
ACT.7.8	 “God gave Abraham circumcision to confirm his promise.
ACT.7.9	 “Jacob’s sons were jealous of their brother Joseph. They sold him into slavery, and he was taken to Egypt. But God was with Joseph 
ACT.7.10	 and rescued him from all his suffering. When Joseph stood in the presence of Pharaoh (the king of Egypt), God gave Joseph divine favor 
ACT.7.11	 Then a famine throughout Egypt and Canaan brought a lot of suffering. Our ancestors couldn’t find any food. 
ACT.7.12	 When Jacob heard that Egypt had food, he sent our ancestors there. That was their first trip. 
ACT.7.13	 On the second trip, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family. 
ACT.7.14	 Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his relatives, 75 people in all. 
ACT.7.15	 So Jacob went to Egypt, and he and our ancestors died there. 
ACT.7.16	 They were taken to Shechem for burial in the tomb that Abraham purchased in Shechem from Hamor’s sons.
ACT.7.17	 “When the time that God had promised to Abraham had almost come, the number of our people in Egypt had grown very large. 
ACT.7.18	 Then a different king, who knew nothing about Joseph, began to rule in Egypt. 
ACT.7.19	 This king was shrewd in the way he took advantage of our people. He mistreated our ancestors. He made them abandon their newborn babies outdoors, where they would die.
ACT.7.20	 “At that time Moses was born, and he was a very beautiful child. His parents took care of him for three months. 
ACT.7.21	 When Moses was abandoned outdoors, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and raised him as her son. 
ACT.7.22	 So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and became a great man in what he said and did. 
ACT.7.23	 When he was 40 years old, he decided to visit his own people, the Israelites. 
ACT.7.24	 When he saw an Israelite man being treated unfairly by an Egyptian, he defended the Israelite. He took revenge by killing the Egyptian. 
ACT.7.25	 Moses thought his own people would understand that God was going to use him to give them freedom. But they didn’t understand. 
ACT.7.26	 The next day Moses saw two Israelites fighting, and he tried to make peace between them. He said to them, ‘Men, you are brothers. Why are you treating each other unfairly?’
ACT.7.27	 “But one of the men pushed Moses aside. He asked Moses, ‘Who made you our ruler and judge? 
ACT.7.28	 Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’ 
ACT.7.29	 After he said that, Moses quickly left Egypt and lived in Midian as a foreigner. In Midian he fathered two sons.
ACT.7.30	 “Forty years later, a Messenger appeared to him in the flames of a burning bush in the desert of Mount Sinai. 
ACT.7.31	 Moses was surprised when he saw this. As he went closer to look at the bush, the voice of the Lord said to him, 
ACT.7.32	 ‘I am the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses began to tremble and didn’t dare to look at the bush. 
ACT.7.33	 The Lord told him, ‘Take off your sandals. The place where you’re standing is holy ground. 
ACT.7.34	 I’ve seen how my people are mistreated in Egypt. I’ve heard their groaning and have come to rescue them. So now I’m sending you to Egypt.’
ACT.7.35	 “This is the Moses whom the Israelites rejected by saying, ‘Who made you our ruler and judge?’ This is the one God sent to free them and to rule them with the help of the Messenger who appeared to him in the bush. 
ACT.7.36	 This is the man who led our ancestors out of Egypt. He is the person who did amazing things and worked miracles in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the desert for 40 years. 
ACT.7.37	 This is the same Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will send you a prophet, an Israelite like me.’ 
ACT.7.38	 This is the Moses who was in the assembly in the desert. Our ancestors and the Messenger who spoke to him on Mount Sinai were there with him. Moses received life-giving messages to give to us, 
ACT.7.39	 but our ancestors were not willing to obey him. Instead, they pushed him aside, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt. 
ACT.7.40	 They told Aaron, ‘We don’t know what has happened to this Moses, who led us out of Egypt. So make gods who will lead us.’ 
ACT.7.41	 That was the time they made a calf. They offered a sacrifice to that false god and delighted in what they had made.
ACT.7.42	 “So God turned away from them and let them worship the sun, moon, and stars. This is written in the book of the prophets: ‘Did you bring me sacrifices and grain offerings in the desert for 40 years, nation of Israel? 
ACT.7.43	 You carried along the shrine of Moloch, the star of the god Rephan, and the statues you made for yourselves to worship. I will send you into exile beyond the city of Babylon.’
ACT.7.44	 “In the desert our ancestors had the tent of God’s promise. Moses built this tent exactly as God had told him. He used the model he had seen. 
ACT.7.45	 After our ancestors received the tent, they brought it into this land. They did this with Joshua’s help when they took possession of the land from the nations that God forced out of our ancestors’ way. This tent remained here until the time of David, 
ACT.7.46	 who won God’s favor. David asked that he might provide a permanent place for the family of Jacob.
ACT.7.47	 But Solomon was the one who built a house for God.
ACT.7.48	 “However, the Most High doesn’t live in a house built by humans, as the prophet says:
ACT.7.49	 ‘The Lord says,
ACT.7.49	“Heaven is my throne.
ACT.7.49	The earth is my footstool.
ACT.7.49	What kind of house are you going to build for me?
ACT.7.49	Where will I rest?
ACT.7.50	 Didn’t I make all these things?” ’
ACT.7.51	 “How stubborn can you be? How can you be so heartless and disobedient? You’re just like your ancestors. They always opposed the Holy Spirit, and so do you! 
ACT.7.52	 Was there ever a prophet your ancestors didn’t persecute? They killed those who predicted that a man with God’s approval would come. You have now become the people who betrayed and murdered that man. 
ACT.7.53	 You are the people who received Moses’ Teachings, which were put into effect by angels. But you haven’t obeyed those teachings.”
ACT.7.54	 As council members listened to Stephen, they became noticeably furious. 
ACT.7.55	 But Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit. He looked into heaven, saw God’s glory, and Jesus in the position of authority that God gives. 
ACT.7.56	 So Stephen said, “Look, I see heaven opened and the Son of Man in the position of authority that God has given him!”
ACT.7.57	 But the council members shouted and refused to listen. Then they rushed at Stephen with one purpose in mind, 
ACT.7.58	 and after they had thrown him out of the city, they began to stone him to death. The witnesses left their coats with a young man named Saul.
ACT.7.59	 While council members were executing Stephen, he called out, “Lord Jesus, welcome my spirit.” 
ACT.7.60	 Then he knelt down and shouted, “Lord, don’t hold this sin against them.” After he had said this, he died.
ACT.8.1	 Saul approved of putting Stephen to death.
ACT.8.1	On that day widespread persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem. Most believers, except the apostles, were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
ACT.8.2	 Devout men buried Stephen as they mourned loudly for him.
ACT.8.3	 Saul tried to destroy the church. He dragged men and women out of one home after another and threw them into prison.
ACT.8.4	 The believers who were scattered went from place to place, where they spread the word. 
ACT.8.5	 Philip went to the city of Samaria and told people about the Messiah. 
ACT.8.6	 The crowds paid close attention to what Philip said. They listened to him and saw the miracles that he performed. 
ACT.8.7	 Evil spirits screamed as they came out of the many people they had possessed. Many paralyzed and lame people were cured. 
ACT.8.8	 As a result, that city was extremely happy.
ACT.8.9	 A man named Simon lived in that city. He amazed the people of Samaria with his practice of magic. He claimed that he was great. 
ACT.8.10	 Everyone from children to adults paid attention to him. They said, “This man is the power of God, and that power is called great.” 
ACT.8.11	 They paid attention to Simon because he had amazed them for a long time with his practice of magic. 
ACT.8.12	 However, when Philip spread the Good News about the kingdom of God and the one named Jesus Christ, men and women believed him and were baptized. 
ACT.8.13	 Even Simon believed, and after he was baptized, he became devoted to Philip. Simon was amazed to see the miracles and impressive things that were happening.
ACT.8.14	 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. 
ACT.8.15	 Peter and John went to Samaria and prayed that the Samaritans would receive the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.8.16	 (Before this the Holy Spirit had not come to any of the Samaritans. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 
ACT.8.17	 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and the Samaritans received the Holy Spirit.
ACT.8.18	 Simon saw that the Spirit was given to the Samaritans when the apostles placed their hands on them. So he offered Peter and John money 
ACT.8.19	 and said, “Give me this power so that anyone I place my hands on will receive the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.8.20	 Peter told Simon, “May your money be destroyed with you because you thought you could buy God’s gift. 
ACT.8.21	 You won’t have any share in this because God can see how twisted your thinking is. 
ACT.8.22	 So change your wicked thoughts, and ask the Lord if he will forgive you for thinking like this. 
ACT.8.23	 I can see that you are bitter with jealousy and wrapped up in your evil ways.”
ACT.8.24	 Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me that none of the things you said will happen to me.”
ACT.8.25	 After they had boldly spoken about the message of the Lord, they spread the Good News in many Samaritan villages on their way back to Jerusalem.
ACT.8.26	 An angel from the Lord said to Philip, “Get up, and take the desert road that goes south from Jerusalem to Gaza.” 
ACT.8.27	 So Philip went.
ACT.8.27	An Ethiopian man who had come to Jerusalem to worship was on his way home. The man was a eunuch, a high-ranking official in charge of all the treasures of Queen Candace of Ethiopia. 
ACT.8.28	 As the official rode along in his carriage, he was reading the prophet Isaiah out loud.
ACT.8.29	 The Spirit said to Philip, “Go to that carriage, and stay close to it.”
ACT.8.30	 Philip ran to the carriage and could hear the official reading the prophet Isaiah out loud. Philip asked him, “Do you understand what you’re reading?”
ACT.8.31	 The official answered, “How can I understand unless someone guides me?” So he invited Philip to sit with him in his carriage.
ACT.8.32	 This was the part of the Scriptures that the official was reading:
ACT.8.32	“He was led like a lamb to the slaughter.
ACT.8.32	He was like a sheep that is silent
ACT.8.32	when its wool is cut off.
ACT.8.32	He didn’t open his mouth.
ACT.8.33	 When he humbled himself,
ACT.8.33	he was not judged fairly.
ACT.8.33	Who from his generation
ACT.8.33	will talk about his life on earth being cut short?”
ACT.8.34	 The official said to Philip, “I would like to know who the prophet is talking about. Is he talking about himself or someone else?” 
ACT.8.35	 Then Philip spoke. Starting with that passage, Philip told the official the Good News about Jesus.
ACT.8.36	 As they were going along the road, they came to some water. The official said to Philip, “Look, there’s some water. What can keep me from being baptized?” 
ACT.8.38	 The official ordered the carriage to stop. He and Philip stepped into the water, and Philip baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	 When they had stepped out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away. The official joyfully continued on his way and didn’t see Philip again.
ACT.8.40	 Philip found himself in the city of Azotus. He traveled through all the cities and spread the Good News until he came to the city of Caesarea.
ACT.9.1	 Saul kept threatening to murder the Lord’s disciples. He went to the chief priest 
ACT.9.2	 and asked him to write letters of authorization to the synagogue leaders in the city of Damascus. Saul wanted to arrest any man or woman who followed the way ⌊of Christ⌋ and imprison them in Jerusalem.
ACT.9.3	 As Saul was coming near the city of Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly flashed around him. 
ACT.9.4	 He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, “Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me?”
ACT.9.5	 Saul asked, “Who are you, sir?”
ACT.9.5	The person replied, “I’m Jesus, the one you’re persecuting. 
ACT.9.6	 Get up! Go into the city, and you’ll be told what you should do.”
ACT.9.7	 Meanwhile, the men traveling with him were speechless. They heard the voice but didn’t see anyone.
ACT.9.8	 Saul was helped up from the ground. When he opened his eyes, he was blind. So his companions led him into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	 For three days he couldn’t see and didn’t eat or drink.
ACT.9.10	 A disciple named Ananias lived in the city of Damascus. The Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias!”
ACT.9.10	Ananias answered, “Yes, Lord.”
ACT.9.11	 The Lord told him, “Get up! Go to Judas’ house on Straight Street, and ask for a man named Saul from the city of Tarsus. He’s praying. 
ACT.9.12	 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias place his hands on him to restore his sight.”
ACT.9.13	 Ananias replied, “Lord, I’ve heard a lot of people tell about the many evil things this man has done to your people in Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.14	 Saul has come here to Damascus with authority from the chief priests to put anyone who calls on your name in prison.”
ACT.9.15	 The Lord told Ananias, “Go! I’ve chosen this man to bring my name to nations, to kings, and to the people of Israel. 
ACT.9.16	 I’ll show him how much he has to suffer for the sake of my name.”
ACT.9.17	 Ananias left and entered Judas’ house. After he placed his hands on Saul, Ananias said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way to Damascus, sent me to you. He wants you to see again and to be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.9.18	 Immediately, something like fish scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. Then Saul stood up and was baptized. 
ACT.9.19	 After he had something to eat, his strength came back to him.
ACT.9.19	Saul was with the disciples in the city of Damascus for several days. 
ACT.9.20	 He immediately began to spread the word in their synagogues that Jesus was the Son of God. 
ACT.9.21	 Everyone who heard him was amazed. They asked, “Isn’t this the man who destroyed those who worshiped the one named Jesus in Jerusalem? Didn’t he come here to take these worshipers as prisoners to the chief priests ⌊in Jerusalem⌋?”
ACT.9.22	 Saul grew more powerful, and he confused the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Messiah. 
ACT.9.23	 Later the Jews planned to murder Saul, 
ACT.9.24	 but Saul was told about their plot. They were watching the city gates day and night in order to murder him. 
ACT.9.25	 However, Saul’s disciples lowered him in a large basket through an opening in the wall one night.
ACT.9.26	 After Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples. But everyone was afraid of him. They wouldn’t believe that he was a disciple.
ACT.9.27	 Then Barnabas took an interest in Saul and brought him to the apostles. Barnabas told the apostles how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and that the Lord had spoken to him. Barnabas also told them how boldly Saul had spoken about the one named Jesus in the city of Damascus. 
ACT.9.28	 Then Saul went throughout Jerusalem with the disciples. He spoke boldly with the power and authority of the Lord.
ACT.9.29	 He talked and argued with Greek-speaking Jews, but they tried to murder him. 
ACT.9.30	 As soon as the disciples found out about this, they took Saul to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus.
ACT.9.31	 Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace. The number of people increased as people lived in the fear of the Lord and the comfort of the Holy Spirit.
ACT.9.32	 When Peter was going around to all of God’s people, he came to those who lived in the city of Lydda. 
ACT.9.33	 In Lydda Peter found a man named Aeneas who was paralyzed and confined to a cot for eight years.
ACT.9.34	 Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you well. Get up, and pick up your cot.” Aeneas immediately got up.
ACT.9.35	 Everyone who lived in the city of Lydda and the coastal region of Sharon saw what had happened to Aeneas and turned to the Lord in faith.
ACT.9.36	 A disciple named Tabitha lived in the city of Joppa. Her Greek name was Dorcas. She always helped people and gave things to the poor. 
ACT.9.37	 She became sick and died. Her body was prepared for burial and was laid in an upstairs room.
ACT.9.38	 Lydda is near the city of Joppa. When the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him. They begged Peter, “Hurry to Joppa! We need your help!”
ACT.9.39	 So Peter went with them. When he arrived, he was taken upstairs. All the widows stood around him. They were crying and showing Peter the articles of clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.
ACT.9.40	 Peter made everyone leave the room.
ACT.9.40	He knelt and prayed. Then he turned toward the body and said, “Tabitha, get up!”
ACT.9.40	Tabitha opened her eyes, saw Peter, and sat up. 
ACT.9.41	 Peter took her hand and helped her stand up. After he called the believers, especially the widows, he presented Tabitha to them. She was alive.
ACT.9.42	 The news about this spread throughout the city of Joppa, and as a result, many people believed in the Lord.
ACT.9.43	 Peter stayed in Joppa for a number of days with Simon, a leatherworker.
ACT.10.1	 A man named Cornelius lived in the city of Caesarea. He was a Roman army officer in the Italian Regiment. 
ACT.10.2	 He and everyone in his home were devout and respected God. Cornelius gave many gifts to poor Jewish people and always prayed to God.
ACT.10.3	 One day, about three in the afternoon, he had a vision. He clearly saw an angel from God come to him and say, “Cornelius!”
ACT.10.4	 He stared at the angel and was terrified. Cornelius asked the angel, “What do you want, sir?”
ACT.10.4	The angel answered him, “God is aware of your prayers and your gifts to the poor, and he has remembered you. 
ACT.10.5	 Send messengers now to the city of Joppa, and summon a man whose name is Simon Peter. 
ACT.10.6	 He is a guest of Simon, a leatherworker, whose house is by the sea.”
ACT.10.7	 After saying this, the angel left. Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier, one of those who served him regularly. 
ACT.10.8	 Cornelius explained everything to them and sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	 Around noon the next day, while Cornelius’ men were on their way and coming close to Joppa, Peter went on the roof to pray. 
ACT.10.10	 He became hungry and wanted to eat. While the food was being prepared, he fell into a trance. 
ACT.10.11	 He saw the sky open and something like a large linen sheet being lowered by its four corners to the ground. 
ACT.10.12	 In the sheet were all kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and birds.
ACT.10.13	 A voice told him, “Get up, Peter! Kill these animals, and eat them.”
ACT.10.14	 Peter answered, “I can’t do that, Lord! I’ve never eaten anything that is impure or unclean.” 
ACT.10.15	 A voice spoke to him a second time, “Don’t say that the things which God has made clean 
ACT.10.16	 This happened three times. Then the sheet was quickly taken into the sky.
ACT.10.17	 While Peter was puzzled by the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found Simon’s house and went to the gate. 
ACT.10.18	 They asked if Simon Peter was staying there. 
ACT.10.19	 Peter was still thinking about the vision when the Spirit said to him, “Three men are looking for you. 
ACT.10.20	 Get up, and go downstairs. Don’t hesitate to go with these men. I have sent them.”
ACT.10.21	 So Peter went to the men. He said, “I’m the man you’re looking for. Why are you here?”
ACT.10.22	 The men replied, “Cornelius, a Roman army officer, sent us. He’s a man who has God’s approval and who respects God. Also, the Jewish people respect him. A holy angel told him to summon you to his home to hear what you have to say.”
ACT.10.23	 Peter asked the men to come into the house and had them stay overnight.
ACT.10.23	The next day Peter left with them. Some disciples from Joppa went along. 
ACT.10.24	 The following day they arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called his relatives and close friends together.
ACT.10.25	 When Peter was about to enter Cornelius’ house, Cornelius met him, bowed down, and worshiped Peter. 
ACT.10.26	 But Peter made him get up. He told him, “Stand up! I’m only a man.”
ACT.10.27	 As Peter talked, he entered Cornelius’ house and found that many people had gathered. 
ACT.10.28	 He said to them, “You understand how wrong it is for a Jewish man to associate or visit with anyone of another race. But God has shown me that I should no longer call anyone impure or unclean. 
ACT.10.29	 That is why I didn’t object to coming here when you sent for me. I want to know why you sent for me.”
ACT.10.30	 Cornelius answered, “Four days ago I was praying at home. It was at this same time, three o’clock in the afternoon. Suddenly, a man dressed in radiant clothes stood in front of me. 
ACT.10.31	 He said to me, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and has remembered your gifts to the poor. 
ACT.10.32	 So send messengers to Joppa, and summon a man whose name is Simon Peter. He’s a guest in the home of Simon, a leatherworker who lives by the sea.’ 
ACT.10.33	 So I sent for you immediately. Thank you for coming. All of us are here now in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has ordered you to say.”
ACT.10.34	 Then Peter said, “Now I understand that God doesn’t play favorites. 
ACT.10.35	 Rather, whoever respects God and does what is right is acceptable to him in any nation. 
ACT.10.36	 God sent his word to the people of Israel and brought them the Good News of peace through Jesus Christ. This Jesus Christ is everyone’s Lord. 
ACT.10.37	 You know what happened throughout Judea. Everything began in Galilee after John spread the news about baptism. 
ACT.10.38	 You know that God anointed Jesus from Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. Jesus went everywhere and did good things, such as healing everyone who was under the devil’s power. Jesus did these things because God was with him. 
ACT.10.39	 We can testify to everything Jesus did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. People hung him on a cross and killed him, 
ACT.10.40	 but God brought him back to life on the third day. God didn’t show him 
ACT.10.41	 to all the people. He showed Jesus to witnesses, apostles he had already chosen. We apostles are those men who ate and drank with Jesus after he came back to life. 
ACT.10.42	 He ordered us to warn the people, ‘God has appointed Jesus to judge the living and the dead.’ 
ACT.10.43	 In addition, all the prophets testify that people who believe in the one named Jesus receive forgiveness for their sins through him.”
ACT.10.44	 While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit came to everyone who heard his message. 
ACT.10.45	 All the believers who were circumcised and who had come with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured on people who were not Jewish. 
ACT.10.46	 They heard these non-Jewish people speaking in other languages and praising God.
ACT.10.46	Then Peter said, 
ACT.10.47	 “No one can refuse to baptize these people with water. They have received the Holy Spirit in the same way that we did.” 
ACT.10.48	 So Peter ordered that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
ACT.10.48	Then they asked Peter to stay with them for several days.
ACT.11.1	 The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that people who were not Jewish had accepted God’s word. 
ACT.11.2	 However, when Peter went to Jerusalem, the believers who insisted on circumcision began to argue with him. 
ACT.11.3	 They said, “You went to visit men who were uncircumcised, and you even ate with them.”
ACT.11.4	 Then Peter began to explain to them point by point what had happened. He said, 
ACT.11.5	 “I was praying in the city of Joppa when I fell into a trance. I saw something like a large linen sheet being lowered by its four corners from the sky. The sheet came near me. 
ACT.11.6	 I looked into the sheet very closely and saw tame animals, wild animals, reptiles, and birds. 
ACT.11.7	 I also heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter! Kill these animals, and eat them.’
ACT.11.8	 “But I answered, ‘I can’t do that, Lord! I’ve never put anything impure or unclean 
ACT.11.9	 “A voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Don’t say that the things which God has made clean 
ACT.11.10	 This happened three times. Then everything was pulled back into the sky again.
ACT.11.11	 “At that moment three men arrived at the house where we were staying. They had been sent from Caesarea to find me. 
ACT.11.12	 The Spirit told me to go with them without any hesitation. Six believers ⌊from Joppa⌋ went with me, and we visited Cornelius’ home.
ACT.11.13	 “He told us that he had seen an angel standing in his home. The angel told him, ‘Send messengers to Joppa, and summon a man whose name is Simon Peter. 
ACT.11.14	 He will give you a message that will save you and everyone in your home.’
ACT.11.15	 “When I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came to these people. This was the same thing that happened to us in the beginning. 
ACT.11.16	 I remembered that the Lord had said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized by the Holy Spirit.’ 
ACT.11.17	 When they believed, God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. So who was I to interfere with God?”
ACT.11.18	 When the others heard this, they had no further objections. They praised God by saying, “Then God has also led people who are not Jewish to turn to him so that they can change the way they think and act and have eternal life.”
ACT.11.19	 Some of the believers who were scattered by the trouble that broke out following Stephen’s death went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and the city of Antioch. They spoke God’s word only to Jewish people. 
ACT.11.20	 But other believers, who were from Cyprus and Cyrene, arrived in Antioch. They started to spread the Good News about the Lord Jesus to Greeks. 
ACT.11.21	 The Lord’s power was with his followers, and a large number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
ACT.11.22	 After the news about Antioch reached the church in Jerusalem, Barnabas was sent to Antioch. 
ACT.11.23	 When he arrived there, he was pleased to see what God had done for them out of kindness.
ACT.11.24	 Barnabas was a dependable man, and he was full of the Holy Spirit and faith. A large crowd believed in the Lord.
ACT.11.25	 Then Barnabas left Antioch to go to the city of Tarsus to look for Saul. 
ACT.11.26	 After finding Saul, Barnabas brought him back to Antioch. Barnabas and Saul met with the church in Antioch for a whole year and taught a large group of people. The disciples were called Christians for the first time in the city of Antioch.
ACT.11.27	 At that time some prophets came from Jerusalem to the city of Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	 One of them was named Agabus. Through the Spirit Agabus predicted that a severe famine would affect the entire world. This happened while Claudius was emperor. 
ACT.11.29	 All the disciples in Antioch decided to contribute whatever they could afford to help the believers living in Judea. 
ACT.11.30	 The disciples did this and sent their contribution with Barnabas and Saul to the leaders ⌊in Jerusalem⌋.
ACT.12.1	 About that time King Herod devoted his attention to mistreating certain members of the church. 
ACT.12.2	 He had James, the brother of John, executed. 
ACT.12.3	 When he saw how this pleased the Jews, he arrested Peter too. This happened during the days of Unleavened Bread. 
ACT.12.4	 After capturing Peter, Herod had him thrown into prison with sixteen soldiers in squads of four to guard him. Herod wanted to bring Peter to trial in front of the people after Passover. 
ACT.12.5	 So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was praying very hard to God for him.
ACT.12.6	 The night before Herod was going to bring Peter to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers. His hands were bound with two chains, and guards were in front of the door. They were watching the prison.
ACT.12.7	 Suddenly, an angel from the Lord stood near Peter, and his cell was filled with light. The angel nudged Peter’s side, woke him up, and said, “Hurry! Get up!” At that moment the chains fell from Peter’s hands.
ACT.12.8	 The angel told him, “Put your shoes on, and get ready to go!” Peter did this. Then the angel told him, “Put your coat on, and follow me.”
ACT.12.9	 Peter followed the angel out of the cell. He didn’t realize that what the angel was doing was actually happening. He thought he was seeing a vision. 
ACT.12.10	 They passed the first and second guardposts and came to the iron gate that led into the city. This gate opened by itself for them, so they went outside and up the street. The angel suddenly left Peter.
ACT.12.11	 When Peter came to his senses, he said, “Now I’m sure that the Lord sent his angel to rescue me from Herod and from everything the Jewish people are expecting to happen to me.”
ACT.12.12	 When Peter realized what had happened, he went to the home of Mary, the mother of John Mark. Many people had gathered at her home and were praying. 
ACT.12.13	 Peter knocked on the door of the entryway, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer. 
ACT.12.14	 When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so happy that instead of opening the door, she ran back inside and reported, “Peter is standing at the door!”
ACT.12.15	 The people told her, “You’re crazy!” But she insisted that Peter was at the door. They said, “It has to be his angel.”
ACT.12.16	 But Peter kept knocking. When they opened the door, they were shocked to see him. 
ACT.12.17	 Peter motioned with his hand to quiet them down and told them how the Lord had taken him out of prison. He added, “Tell James and the other believers about this.” Then he left and went somewhere else.
ACT.12.18	 In the morning the soldiers were in an uproar over what had happened to Peter. 
ACT.12.19	 Herod searched for Peter but couldn’t find him. So he questioned the guards and gave orders to have them executed.
ACT.12.19	Then Herod left Judea and went to Caesarea, where he stayed for a while.
ACT.12.20	 Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They were going to meet with Herod. They had agreed on what they wanted to do: They enlisted the help of Blastus to ask Herod for terms of peace. This was because their cities depended on Herod for their food supply. (Blastus was in charge of the king’s living quarters.)
ACT.12.21	 The appointed day came. Herod, wearing his royal clothes, sat on his throne and began making a speech to them. 
ACT.12.22	 The people started shouting, “The voice of a god and not of a man!”
ACT.12.23	 Immediately, an angel from the Lord killed Herod for not giving glory to God. Herod was eaten by maggots, and he died.
ACT.12.24	 But God’s word continued to spread and win many followers.
ACT.12.25	 After Barnabas and Saul delivered the contribution ⌊to the leaders in Jerusalem⌋, they returned ⌊to Antioch⌋ from Jerusalem. They brought John Mark with them.
ACT.13.1	 Barnabas, Simeon (called the Black), Lucius (from Cyrene), Manaen (a close friend of Herod since childhood), and Saul were prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch.
ACT.13.2	 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set Barnabas and Saul apart for me. I want them to do the work for which I called them.” 
ACT.13.3	 After fasting and praying, Simeon, Lucius, and Manaen placed their hands on Barnabas and Saul, and released them ⌊from their work in Antioch⌋.
ACT.13.4	 After Barnabas and Saul were sent by the Holy Spirit, they went to the city of Seleucia and from there sailed to the island of Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	 Arriving in the city of Salamis, they began to spread God’s word in the synagogues. John Mark had gone along to help them. 
ACT.13.6	 They went through the whole island as far as the city of Paphos.
ACT.13.6	In Paphos they met a Jewish man named Barjesus. He was an astrologer who claimed to be a prophet. 
ACT.13.7	 He was associated with an intelligent man, Sergius Paulus, who was the governor of the island. The governor sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.8	 Elymas, whose name means 
ACT.13.9	 But Saul, also known as Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit. He stared at Elymas 
ACT.13.10	 and said, “You are full of dirty tricks and schemes, you son of the devil! You hate everything that has God’s approval. Quit trying to distort the truth about the way the Lord wants people to live. 
ACT.13.11	 The Lord is against you now. For a while you will be blind, unable to see the light of day.”
ACT.13.11	Suddenly, Elymas couldn’t see a thing. He tried to find people to lead him. 
ACT.13.12	 When the governor saw what had happened, he believed. The Lord’s teachings amazed him.
ACT.13.13	 Paul and his men took a ship from Paphos and arrived in Perga, a city in Pamphylia. John Mark deserted them there and went back to Jerusalem. 
ACT.13.14	 Paul and Barnabas left Perga and arrived in Antioch, a city near Pisidia. On the day of worship they went into the synagogue and sat down.
ACT.13.15	 After reading from Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent ⌊a message⌋ to Paul and Barnabas. The message said, “Brothers, if you have any words of encouragement for the people, feel free to speak.”
ACT.13.16	 Then Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and said, “Men of Israel and converts to Judaism, listen to me. 
ACT.13.17	 The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors and made them a strong nation while they lived as foreigners in Egypt. He used his powerful arm to bring them out of Egypt, 
ACT.13.18	 and he put up with them for about forty years in the desert. 
ACT.13.19	 Then he destroyed seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to his people as an inheritance. 
ACT.13.20	 He did all this in about four hundred and fifty years.
ACT.13.20	“After that he gave his people judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.
ACT.13.21	 “Then the people demanded a king, so God gave them Saul, son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin. After forty years 
ACT.13.22	 God removed Saul and made David their king. God spoke favorably about David. He said, ‘I have found that David, son of Jesse, is a man after my own heart. He will do everything I want him to do.’
ACT.13.23	 “God had the Savior, Jesus, come to Israel from David’s descendants, as he had promised. 
ACT.13.24	 Before Jesus began his ministry, John ⌊the Baptizer⌋ told everyone in Israel about the baptism of repentance.
ACT.13.25	 When John was finishing his work, he said, ‘Who do you think I am? I’m not the person you’re looking for. He will come later. I’m not even good enough to untie his sandals.’
ACT.13.26	 “Brothers—descendants of Abraham and converts to Judaism—the message that God saves people was sent to us. 
ACT.13.27	 The people who live in Jerusalem and their rulers didn’t know who Jesus was. They didn’t understand the prophets’ messages, which are read every day of worship. So they condemned Jesus and fulfilled what the prophets had said. 
ACT.13.28	 Although they couldn’t find any good reason to kill him, they asked Pilate to have him executed. 
ACT.13.29	 When they had finished doing everything that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and placed him in a tomb. 
ACT.13.30	 But God brought him back to life, 
ACT.13.31	 and for many days he appeared to those who had come with him to Jerusalem from Galilee. These people are now witnesses and are testifying to the Jewish people about him. 
ACT.13.32	 We are telling you the Good News: What God promised our ancestors has happened. 
ACT.13.33	 God has fulfilled the promise for us, their descendants, by bringing Jesus back to life. This is what Scripture says in the second psalm:
ACT.13.33	‘You are my Son.
ACT.13.33	Today I have become your Father.’
ACT.13.34	 “God stated that he brought Jesus back to life and that Jesus’ body never decayed. He said, ‘I will give you the enduring love promised to David.’ 
ACT.13.35	 Another psalm says, ‘You will not allow your holy one to decay.’ 
ACT.13.36	 After doing God’s will by serving the people of his time, David died. He was laid to rest with his ancestors, but his body decayed. 
ACT.13.37	 However, the man God brought back to life had a body that didn’t decay.
ACT.13.38	 “So, brothers, I’m telling you that through Jesus your sins can be forgiven. Sins kept you from receiving God’s approval through Moses’ Teachings. 
ACT.13.39	 However, everyone who believes in Jesus receives God’s approval.
ACT.13.40	 “Be careful, or what the prophets said may happen to you.
ACT.13.41	 ‘Look, you mockers!
ACT.13.41	Be amazed and die!
ACT.13.41	I am going to do something in your days
ACT.13.41	that you would not believe even if it were reported to you!’ ”
ACT.13.42	 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak on the same subject the next day of worship. 
ACT.13.43	 When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas. Paul and Barnabas talked with them and were persuading them to continue trusting God’s good will.
ACT.13.44	 On the next day of worship, almost the whole city gathered to hear the Lord’s word. 
ACT.13.45	 When the Jews saw the crowds, they became very jealous. They used insulting language to contradict whatever Paul said.
ACT.13.46	 Paul and Barnabas told them boldly, “We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject the word and consider yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, we are now going to turn to people of other nations. 
ACT.13.47	 The Lord gave us the following order:
ACT.13.47	‘I have made you a light for the nations
ACT.13.47	so that you would save people all over the world.’ ”
ACT.13.48	 The people who were not Jews were pleased with what they heard and praised the Lord’s word. Everyone who had been prepared for everlasting life believed. 
ACT.13.49	 The word of the Lord spread throughout the whole region. 
ACT.13.50	 But Jews stirred up devout women of high social standing and the officials of the city. These people started to persecute Paul and Barnabas and threw them out of their territory.
ACT.13.51	 In protest against these people, Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet and went to the city of Iconium. 
ACT.13.52	 Meanwhile, the disciples ⌊in Antioch⌋ continued to be full of joy and the Holy Spirit.
ACT.14.1	 The same thing happened in the city of Iconium. Paul and Barnabas went into the synagogue and spoke in such a way that a large crowd of Jews and Greeks believed. 
ACT.14.2	 But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up some people who were not Jewish and poisoned their minds against the believers. 
ACT.14.3	 Paul and Barnabas stayed in the city of Iconium for a long time. They spoke boldly about the Lord, who confirmed their message about his good will 
ACT.14.4	 But the people of Iconium were divided. Some were for the Jews, while others were for the apostles.
ACT.14.5	 In the meantime, Paul and Barnabas found out that the non-Jewish people and the Jewish people with their rulers planned to attack them and stone them to death. 
ACT.14.6	 So they escaped to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding territory. 
ACT.14.7	 They spread the Good News there.
ACT.14.8	 A man who was born lame was in Lystra. He was always sitting because he had never been able to walk. 
ACT.14.9	 He listened to what Paul was saying. Paul observed him closely and saw that the man believed he could be made well. 
ACT.14.10	 So Paul said in a loud voice, “Stand up.” The man jumped up and began to walk.
ACT.14.11	 The crowds who saw what Paul had done shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come to us, and they look human.” 
ACT.14.12	 They addressed Barnabas as Zeus and Paul as Hermes because Paul did most of the talking. 
ACT.14.13	 Zeus’ temple was at the entrance to the city. The priest of the god Zeus brought bulls with flowery wreaths around their necks to the temple gates. The priest and the crowd wanted to offer a sacrifice ⌊to Paul and Barnabas⌋.
ACT.14.14	 When the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard what was happening, they were very upset. They rushed into the crowd 
ACT.14.15	 and said, “Men, what are you doing? We’re human beings like you. We’re spreading the Good News to you to turn you away from these worthless gods to the living God. The living God made the sky, the land, the sea, and everything in them. 
ACT.14.16	 In the past God allowed all people to live as they pleased. 
ACT.14.17	 Yet, by doing good, he has given evidence of his existence. He gives you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons. He fills you with food and your lives with happiness.” 
ACT.14.18	 Although Paul and Barnabas said these things, they hardly kept the crowd from sacrificing to them.
ACT.14.19	 However, Jews from the cities of Antioch and Iconium arrived in Lystra and won the people over. They tried to stone Paul to death and dragged him out of the city when they thought that he was dead. 
ACT.14.20	 But when the disciples gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city.
ACT.14.20	The next day Paul and Barnabas left for the city of Derbe. 
ACT.14.21	 They spread the Good News in that city and won many disciples. Then they went back to the cities of Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch (which is in Pisidia). 
ACT.14.22	 They strengthened the disciples in these cities and encouraged the disciples to remain faithful. Paul and Barnabas told them, “We must suffer a lot to enter the kingdom of God.” 
ACT.14.23	 They had the disciples in each church choose spiritual leaders,
ACT.14.24	 After they had gone through Pisidia, they went to Pamphylia. 
ACT.14.25	 They spoke the message in the city of Perga and went to the city of Attalia. 
ACT.14.26	 From Attalia they took a boat and headed home to the city of Antioch ⌊in Syria⌋. (In Antioch they had been entrusted to God’s care 
ACT.14.27	 When they arrived, they called the members of the church together. They reported everything God had done through them, especially that he had given people who were not Jewish the opportunity to believe. 
ACT.14.28	 They stayed for a long time with these disciples.
ACT.15.1	 Some men came from Judea and started to teach believers that people can’t be saved unless they are circumcised as Moses’ Teachings require. 
ACT.15.2	 Paul and Barnabas had a fierce dispute with these men. So Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were sent to Jerusalem to see the apostles and spiritual leaders 
ACT.15.3	 The church sent Paul and Barnabas ⌊to Jerusalem⌋. As they were going through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told the whole story of how non-Jewish people were turning to God. This story brought great joy to all the believers.
ACT.15.4	 The church in Jerusalem, the apostles, and the spiritual leaders welcomed Paul and Barnabas when they arrived. Paul and Barnabas reported everything that God had done through them. 
ACT.15.5	 But some believers from the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “People who are not Jewish must be circumcised and ordered to follow Moses’ Teachings.”
ACT.15.6	 The apostles and spiritual leaders met to consider this statement. 
ACT.15.7	 After a lot of debating, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know what happened some time ago. God chose me so that people who aren’t Jewish could hear the Good News and believe. 
ACT.15.8	 God, who knows everyone’s thoughts, showed that he approved of people who aren’t Jewish by giving them the Holy Spirit as he gave the Holy Spirit to us. 
ACT.15.9	 God doesn’t discriminate between Jewish and non-Jewish people. He has cleansed non-Jewish people through faith as he has cleansed us Jews. 
ACT.15.10	 So why are you testing God? You’re putting a burden on the disciples, a burden neither our ancestors nor we can carry. 
ACT.15.11	 We certainly believe that the Lord Jesus saves us the same way that he saves them—through his kindness.” 
ACT.15.12	 The whole crowd was silent. They listened to Barnabas and Paul tell about all the miracles and amazing things that God had done through them among non-Jewish people.
ACT.15.13	 After they finished speaking, James responded, “Brothers, listen to me. 
ACT.15.14	 Simon has explained how God first showed his concern by taking from non-Jewish people those who would honor his name. 
ACT.15.15	 This agrees with what the prophets said. Scripture says,
ACT.15.16	 ‘Afterwards, I will return.
ACT.15.16	I will set up David’s fallen tent again.
ACT.15.16	I will restore its ruined places again.
ACT.15.16	I will set it up again
ACT.15.17	 so that the survivors and all the people who aren’t Jewish
ACT.15.17	over whom my name is spoken,
ACT.15.17	may search for the Lord, declares the Lord.
ACT.15.18	 He is the one who will do these things that have always been known!’
ACT.15.19	 “So I’ve decided that we shouldn’t trouble non-Jewish people who are turning to God. 
ACT.15.20	 Instead, we should write a letter telling them to keep away from things polluted by false gods, from sexual sins, from eating the meat of strangled animals, and from eating bloody meat. 
ACT.15.21	 After all, Moses’ words have been spread to every city for generations. His teachings are read in synagogues on every day of worship.”
ACT.15.22	 Then the apostles, the spiritual leaders, and the whole church decided to choose some of their men to send with Paul and Barnabas to the city of Antioch. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, who were leaders among the believers. 
ACT.15.23	 They wrote this letter for them to deliver:
ACT.15.23	From the apostles and the spiritual leaders, your brothers.
ACT.15.23	To their non-Jewish brothers and sisters in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.
ACT.15.23	Dear brothers and sisters,
ACT.15.24	 We have heard that some individuals who came from us have confused you with statements that disturb you. We did not authorize these men ⌊to speak⌋. 
ACT.15.25	 So we have come to a unanimous decision that we should choose men and send them to you with our dear Barnabas and Paul. 
ACT.15.26	 Barnabas and Paul have dedicated their lives to our Lord, the one named Jesus Christ. 
ACT.15.27	 We have sent Judas and Silas to report to you on our decision. 
ACT.15.28	 The Holy Spirit and we have agreed not to place any additional burdens on you. Do only what is necessary 
ACT.15.29	 by keeping away from food sacrificed to false gods, from eating bloody meat, from eating the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual sins. If you avoid these things, you will be doing what’s right.
ACT.15.29	Farewell!
ACT.15.30	 So the men were sent on their way and arrived in the city of Antioch. They gathered the congregation together and delivered the letter. 
ACT.15.31	 When the people read the letter, they were pleased with the encouragement it brought them. 
ACT.15.32	 Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, spoke a long time to encourage and strengthen the believers.
ACT.15.33	 After Judas and Silas had stayed in Antioch for some time, the congregation sent them back to Jerusalem with friendly greetings to those who had sent them.
ACT.15.35	 Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch. They and many others taught people about the Lord’s word and spread the Good News.
ACT.15.36	 After a while Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s go back to every city where we spread the Lord’s word. We’ll visit the believers to see how they’re doing.”
ACT.15.37	 Barnabas wanted to take John Mark along. 
ACT.15.38	 However, Paul didn’t think it was right to take a person like him along. John Mark had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to work. 
ACT.15.39	 Paul and Barnabas disagreed so sharply that they parted ways. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed to the island of Cyprus. 
ACT.15.40	 Paul chose Silas and left after the believers entrusted him to the Lord’s care.
ACT.15.41	 Paul went through the provinces of Syria and Cilicia and strengthened the churches.
ACT.16.1	 Paul arrived in the city of Derbe and then went to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived. Timothy’s mother was a Jewish believer, but his father was Greek. 
ACT.16.2	 The believers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of Timothy. 
ACT.16.3	 Paul wanted Timothy to go with him. So he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in those places and because he knew that Timothy’s father was Greek.
ACT.16.4	 As they went through the cities, they told people about the decisions that the apostles and spiritual leaders 
ACT.16.5	 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew in numbers every day.
ACT.16.6	 Paul and Silas went through the regions of Phrygia and Galatia because the Holy Spirit kept them from speaking the word in the province of Asia. 
ACT.16.7	 They went to the province of Mysia and tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus wouldn’t allow this. 
ACT.16.8	 So they passed by Mysia and went to the city of Troas.
ACT.16.9	 During the night Paul had a vision of a man from Macedonia. The man urged Paul, “Come to Macedonia to help us.”
ACT.16.10	 As soon as Paul had seen the vision, we immediately looked for a way to go to Macedonia. We concluded that God had called us to tell the people of Macedonia about the Good News.
ACT.16.11	 So we took a ship from Troas and sailed straight to the island of Samothrace. The next day we sailed to the city of Neapolis, 
ACT.16.12	 and from there we went to the city of Philippi. Philippi is a leading city in that part of Macedonia, and it is a Roman colony. We were in this city for a number of days.
ACT.16.13	 On the day of worship we went out of the city to a place along the river where we thought Jewish people gathered for prayer. We sat down and began talking to the women who had gathered there. 
ACT.16.14	 A woman named Lydia was present. She was a convert to Judaism from the city of Thyatira and sold purple dye for a living. She was listening because the Lord made her willing to pay attention to what Paul said. 
ACT.16.15	 When Lydia and her family were baptized, she invited us to stay at her home. She said, “If you’re convinced that I believe in the Lord, then stay at my home.” She insisted. So we did.
ACT.16.16	 One day when we were going to the place of prayer, a female servant met us. She was possessed by an evil spirit that told fortunes. She made a lot of money for her owners by telling fortunes. 
ACT.16.17	 She used to follow Paul and shout, “These men are servants of the Most High God. They’re telling you how you can be saved.” 
ACT.16.18	 She kept doing this for many days. Paul became annoyed, turned to the evil spirit, and said, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!”
ACT.16.18	As Paul said this, the evil spirit left her. 
ACT.16.19	 When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them to the authorities in the public square. 
ACT.16.20	 In front of the Roman officials, they said, “These men are stirring up a lot of trouble in our city. They’re Jews, 
ACT.16.21	 and they’re advocating customs that we can’t accept or practice as Roman citizens.”
ACT.16.22	 The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas. Then the officials tore the clothes off Paul and Silas and ordered ⌊the guards⌋ to beat them with sticks. 
ACT.16.23	 After they had hit Paul and Silas many times, they threw them in jail and ordered the jailer to keep them under tight security. 
ACT.16.24	 So the jailer followed these orders and put Paul and Silas into solitary confinement with their feet in leg irons.
ACT.16.25	 Around midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God. The other prisoners were listening to them. 
ACT.16.26	 Suddenly, a violent earthquake shook the foundations of the jail. All the doors immediately flew open, and all the prisoners’ chains came loose.
ACT.16.27	 The jailer woke up and saw the prison doors open. Thinking the prisoners had escaped, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself. 
ACT.16.28	 But Paul shouted as loudly as he could, “Don’t hurt yourself! We’re all here!”
ACT.16.29	 The jailer asked for torches and rushed into the jail. He was trembling as he knelt in front of Paul and Silas. 
ACT.16.30	 Then he took Paul and Silas outside and asked, “Sirs, what do I have to do to be saved?”
ACT.16.31	 They answered, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you and your family will be saved.” 
ACT.16.32	 They spoke the Lord’s word to the jailer and everyone in his home.
ACT.16.33	 At that hour of the night, the jailer washed Paul and Silas’ wounds. The jailer and his entire family were baptized immediately. 
ACT.16.34	 He took Paul and Silas upstairs into his home and gave them something to eat. He and his family were thrilled to be believers in God.
ACT.16.35	 In the morning the Roman officials sent guards who told the jailer, “You can release those men now.”
ACT.16.36	 The jailer reported this order to Paul by saying, “The officials have sent word to release you. So you can leave peacefully now.”
ACT.16.37	 But Paul told the guards, “Roman officials have had us beaten publicly without a trial and have thrown us in jail, even though we’re Roman citizens. Now are they going to throw us out secretly? There’s no way they’re going to get away with that! Have them escort us out!”
ACT.16.38	 The guards reported to the officials what Paul had said. When the Roman officials heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were afraid. 
ACT.16.39	 So the officials went to the jail and apologized to Paul and Silas. As the officials escorted Paul and Silas out of the jail, they asked them to leave the city.
ACT.16.40	 After Paul and Silas left the jail, they went to Lydia’s house. They met with the believers, encouraged them, and then left.
ACT.17.1	 Paul and Silas traveled through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to the city of Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue. 
ACT.17.2	 As usual, Paul went into the synagogue. On three consecutive days of worship, he had discussions about Scripture with the synagogue members. 
ACT.17.3	 He explained and showed them that the Messiah had to suffer, die, and come back to life, and that Jesus, the person he talked about, was this Messiah.
ACT.17.4	 Some of the Jews were persuaded to join Paul and Silas, especially a large group of Greeks who had converted to Judaism and the wives of many prominent men.
ACT.17.5	 Then the Jews became jealous. They took some low-class characters who hung around the public square, formed a mob, and started a riot in the city. They attacked Jason’s home and searched it for Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd. 
ACT.17.6	 When they didn’t find Paul and Silas, they dragged Jason and some other believers in front of the city officials. They shouted, “Those men who have made trouble all over the world are now here in Thessalonica, 
ACT.17.7	 and Jason has welcomed them as his guests. All of them oppose the emperor’s decrees by saying that there is another king, whose name is Jesus.”
ACT.17.8	 The crowd and the officials were upset when they heard this. 
ACT.17.9	 But after they had made Jason and the others post bond, they let them go.
ACT.17.10	 Immediately when night came, the believers sent Paul and Silas to the city of Berea.
ACT.17.10	When Paul and Silas arrived in the city of Berea, they entered the synagogue. 
ACT.17.11	 The people of Berea were more open-minded than the people of Thessalonica. They were very willing to receive God’s message, and every day they carefully examined the Scriptures to see if what Paul said was true. 
ACT.17.12	 Many of them became believers, and quite a number of them were prominent Greek men and women.
ACT.17.13	 But when the Jews in Thessalonica found out that Paul was also spreading God’s word in Berea, they went there to upset and confuse the people. 
ACT.17.14	 The believers immediately sent Paul to the seacoast, but Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea.
ACT.17.15	 The men who escorted Paul took him all the way to the city of Athens. When the men left Athens, they took instructions back to Silas and Timothy to join Paul as soon as possible.
ACT.17.16	 While Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy in Athens, he saw that the city had statues of false gods everywhere. This upset him. 
ACT.17.17	 He held discussions in the synagogue with Jews and converts to Judaism. He also held discussions every day in the public square with anyone who happened to be there. 
ACT.17.18	 Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers had discussions with him. Some asked, “What is this babbling fool trying to say?” Others said, “He seems to be speaking about foreign gods.” The philosophers said these things because Paul was telling the Good News about Jesus and saying that people would come back to life.
ACT.17.19	 Then they brought Paul to the city court, the Areopagus, and asked, “Could you tell us these new ideas that you’re teaching? 
ACT.17.20	 Some of the things you say sound strange to us. So we would like to know what they mean.”
ACT.17.21	 Everyone who lived in Athens looked for opportunities to tell or hear something new and unusual.
ACT.17.22	 Paul stood in the middle of the court and said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious. 
ACT.17.23	 As I was going through your city and looking closely at the objects you worship, I noticed an altar with this written on it: ‘To an unknown god.’ I’m telling you about the unknown god you worship. 
ACT.17.24	 The God who made the universe and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He doesn’t live in shrines made by humans, 
ACT.17.25	 and he isn’t served by humans as if he needed anything. He gives everyone life, breath, and everything they have. 
ACT.17.26	 From one man he has made every nation of humanity to live all over the earth. He has given them the seasons of the year and the boundaries within which to live. 
ACT.17.27	 He has done this so that they would look for God, somehow reach for him, and find him. In fact, he is never far from any one of us. 
ACT.17.28	 Certainly, we live, move, and exist because of him. As some of your poets have said, ‘We are God’s children.’ 
ACT.17.29	 So if we are God’s children, we shouldn’t think that the divine being is like an image made from gold, silver, or stone, an image that is the product of human imagination and skill.
ACT.17.30	 “God overlooked the times when people didn’t know any better. But now he commands everyone everywhere to turn to him and change the way they think and act. 
ACT.17.31	 He has set a day when he is going to judge the world with justice, and he will use a man he has appointed to do this. God has given proof to everyone that he will do this by bringing that man back to life.”
ACT.17.32	 When the people of the court heard that a person had come back to life, some began joking about it, while others said, “We’ll hear you talk about this some other time.”
ACT.17.33	 With this response, Paul left the court. 
ACT.17.34	 Some men joined him and became believers. With them were Dionysius, who was a member of the court, and a woman named Damaris, and some other people.
ACT.18.1	 After this, Paul left Athens and went to the city of Corinth. 
ACT.18.2	 In Corinth he met a Jewish man named Aquila and his wife Priscilla. Aquila had been born in Pontus, and they had recently come from Italy because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them, 
ACT.18.3	 and because they made tents for a living as he did, he stayed with them and they worked together.
ACT.18.4	 On every day of worship, Paul would discuss ⌊Scripture⌋ in the synagogue. He tried to win over Jews and Greeks who had converted to Judaism. 
ACT.18.5	 But when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted all his time to teaching the word of God. He assured the Jews that Jesus is the Messiah. 
ACT.18.6	 But they opposed him and insulted him. So Paul shook the dust from his clothes and told them, “You’re responsible for your own death. I’m innocent. From now on I’m going to people who are not Jewish.”
ACT.18.7	 Then he left the synagogue and went to the home of a man named Titius Justus, who was a convert to Judaism. His house was next door to the synagogue. 
ACT.18.8	 The synagogue leader Crispus and his whole family believed in the Lord. Many Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.
ACT.18.9	 One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision, “Don’t be afraid to speak out! Don’t be silent! 
ACT.18.10	 I’m with you. No one will attack you or harm you. I have many people in this city.”
ACT.18.11	 Paul lived in Corinth for a year and a half and taught the word of God to them.
ACT.18.12	 While Gallio was governor of Greece, the Jews had one thought in mind. They attacked Paul and brought him to court. 
ACT.18.13	 They said, “This man is persuading people to worship God in ways that are against Moses’ Teachings.”
ACT.18.14	 Paul was about to answer when Gallio said to the Jews, “If there were some kind of misdemeanor or crime involved, reason would demand that I put up with you Jews. 
ACT.18.15	 But since you’re disputing words, names, and your own teachings, you’ll have to take care of that yourselves. I don’t want to be a judge who gets involved in those things.” 
ACT.18.16	 So Gallio had them forced out of his court.
ACT.18.17	 Then all ⌊the governor’s officers⌋ took Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the court. But Gallio couldn’t have cared less.
ACT.18.18	 After staying in Corinth quite a while longer, Paul left ⌊for Ephesus⌋. Priscilla and Aquila went with him. In the city of Cenchrea, Aquila had his hair cut, since he had taken a vow. From Cenchrea they took a boat headed for Syria 
ACT.18.19	 and arrived in the city of Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. Paul went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews. 
ACT.18.20	 The Jews asked him to stay longer, but he refused. 
ACT.18.21	 As he left, he told them, “I’ll come back to visit you if God wants me to.”
ACT.18.21	Paul took a boat from Ephesus 
ACT.18.22	 and arrived in the city of Caesarea. He went ⌊to Jerusalem⌋, greeted the church, and went back to the city of Antioch.
ACT.18.23	 After spending some time in Antioch, Paul went through the regions of Galatia and Phrygia, where he strengthened ⌊the faith of⌋ all the disciples.
ACT.18.24	 A Jew named Apollos, who had been born in Alexandria, arrived in the city of Ephesus. He was an eloquent speaker and knew how to use the Scriptures in a powerful way. 
ACT.18.25	 He had been instructed in the Lord’s way and spoke enthusiastically. He accurately taught about Jesus but knew only about the baptism John performed. 
ACT.18.26	 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him ⌊home⌋ with them and explained God’s way to him more accurately.
ACT.18.27	 When Apollos wanted to travel to Greece, the believers ⌊in Ephesus⌋ encouraged him. They wrote to the disciples in Greece to tell them to welcome him. When he arrived in Greece, God’s kindness 
ACT.18.28	 In public Apollos helped them by clearly showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah and that the Jews were wrong.
ACT.19.1	 While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the interior provinces to get to the city of Ephesus. He met some disciples in Ephesus 
ACT.19.2	 and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?”
ACT.19.2	They answered him, “No, we’ve never even heard of the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.19.3	 Paul asked them, “What kind of baptism did you have?”
ACT.19.3	They answered, “John’s baptism.”
ACT.19.4	 Paul said, “John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance.
ACT.19.5	 After they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.19.6	 When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came to them, and they began to talk in other languages and to speak what God had revealed. 
ACT.19.7	 About twelve men were in the group.
ACT.19.8	 For three months Paul would go into the synagogue and speak boldly. He had discussions with people to convince them about the kingdom of God. 
ACT.19.9	 But when some people became stubborn, refused to believe, and had nothing good to say in front of the crowd about the way ⌊of Christ⌋, he left them. He took his disciples and held daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. 
ACT.19.10	 This continued for two years so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.
ACT.19.11	 God worked unusual miracles through Paul. 
ACT.19.12	 People would take handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched Paul’s skin to those who were sick. Their sicknesses would be cured, and evil spirits would leave them.
ACT.19.13	 Some Jews used to travel from place to place and force evil spirits out of people. They tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to force evil spirits out of those who were possessed. These Jews would say, “I order you ⌊to come out⌋ in the name of Jesus, whom Paul talks about.” 
ACT.19.14	 Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.
ACT.19.15	 But the evil spirit answered them, “I know Jesus, and I’m acquainted with Paul, but who are you?” 
ACT.19.16	 Then the man possessed by the evil spirit attacked them. He beat them up so badly that they ran out of that house naked and wounded.
ACT.19.17	 All the Jews and Greeks living in the city of Ephesus heard about this. All of them were filled with awe for the name of the Lord Jesus and began to speak very highly about it. 
ACT.19.18	 Many believers openly admitted their involvement with magical spells and told all the details. 
ACT.19.19	 Many of those who were involved in the occult gathered their books and burned them in front of everyone. They added up the cost of these books and found that they were worth 50,000 silver coins. 
ACT.19.20	 In this powerful way the word of the Lord was spreading and gaining strength.
ACT.19.21	 After all these things had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem by traveling through Macedonia and Greece. He said, “After I have been there, I must see Rome.” 
ACT.19.22	 So he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed longer in the province of Asia.
ACT.19.23	 During that time a serious disturbance concerning the way ⌊of Christ⌋ broke out in the city of Ephesus.
ACT.19.24	 Demetrius, a silversmith, was in the business of making silver models of the temple of Artemis. His business brought a huge profit for the men who worked for him. 
ACT.19.25	 He called a meeting of his workers and others who did similar work. Demetrius said, “Men, you know that we’re earning a good income from this business, 
ACT.19.26	 and you see and hear what this man Paul has done. He has won over a large crowd that follows him not only in Ephesus but also throughout the province of Asia. He tells people that gods made by humans are not gods. 
ACT.19.27	 There’s a danger that people will discredit our line of work, and there’s a danger that people will think that the temple of the great goddess Artemis is nothing. Then she whom all Asia and the rest of the world worship will be robbed of her glory.”
ACT.19.28	 When Demetrius’ workers and the others heard this, they became furious and began shouting, “Artemis of the Ephesians is great!” 
ACT.19.29	 The confusion spread throughout the city, and the people had one thought in mind as they rushed into the theater. They grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, the Macedonians who traveled with Paul, and they dragged the two men into the theater with them.
ACT.19.30	 Paul wanted to go into the crowd, but his disciples wouldn’t let him. 
ACT.19.31	 Even some officials who were from the province of Asia and who were Paul’s friends sent messengers to urge him not to risk going into the theater.
ACT.19.32	 Some people shouted one thing while others shouted something else. The crowd was confused. Most of the people didn’t even know why they had come together. 
ACT.19.33	 Some people concluded that Alexander was the cause, so the Jews pushed him to the front. Alexander motioned with his hand to quiet the people because he wanted to defend himself in front of them. 
ACT.19.34	 But when they recognized that Alexander was a Jew, everyone started to shout in unison, “Artemis of the Ephesians is great!” They kept doing this for about two hours.
ACT.19.35	 The city clerk finally quieted the crowd. Then he said, “Citizens of Ephesus, everyone knows that this city of the Ephesians is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis. Everyone knows that Ephesus is the keeper of the statue that fell down from Zeus. 
ACT.19.36	 No one can deny this. So you have to be quiet and not do anything foolish. 
ACT.19.37	 The men you brought here don’t rob temples or insult our goddess. 
ACT.19.38	 If Demetrius and the men who work for him have a legal complaint against anyone, we have special days and officials to hold court. That’s where they should bring charges against each other. 
ACT.19.39	 If you want anything else, you must settle the matter in a legal assembly. 
ACT.19.40	 At this moment we run the risk of being accused of rioting today for no reason. We won’t be able to explain this mob.” 
ACT.19.41	 After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	 When the uproar was over, Paul sent for the disciples, encouraged them, said goodbye, and left for Macedonia. 
ACT.20.2	 He went through that region and spoke many words of encouragement to the people. Then he went to Greece 
ACT.20.3	 and stayed there for three months.
ACT.20.3	When Paul was going to board a ship for Syria, he found out that the Jews were plotting to kill him. So he decided to go back through Macedonia. 
ACT.20.4	 Sopater (son of Pyrrhus) from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia accompanied Paul. 
ACT.20.5	 All these men went ahead and were waiting for us in Troas. 
ACT.20.6	 After the Festival of Unleavened Bread, we boarded a ship at Philippi. Five days later we joined them in Troas and stayed there for seven days.
ACT.20.7	 On Sunday we met to break bread. Paul was discussing ⌊Scripture⌋ with the people. Since he intended to leave the next day, he kept talking until midnight. 
ACT.20.8	 (Many lamps were lit in the upstairs room where we were meeting.)
ACT.20.9	 A young man named Eutychus was sitting in a window. As Paul was talking on and on, Eutychus was gradually falling asleep. Finally, overcome by sleep, he fell from the third story and was dead when they picked him up. 
ACT.20.10	 Paul went to him, took him into his arms, and said, “Don’t worry! He’s alive!” 
ACT.20.11	 Then Eutychus went upstairs again, broke the bread, and ate. Paul talked with the people for a long time, until sunrise, and then left.
ACT.20.12	 The people took the boy home. They were greatly relieved that he was alive.
ACT.20.13	 We went ahead to the ship and sailed for the city of Assos. At Assos, we were going to pick up Paul. He had made these arrangements, since he had planned to walk overland to Assos. 
ACT.20.14	 When Paul met us in Assos, we took him on board and went to the city of Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	 We sailed from there. On the following day we approached the island of Chios. The next day we went by the island of Samos, and on the next day we arrived at the city of Miletus. 
ACT.20.16	 Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia. He was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, if that was possible.
ACT.20.17	 From Miletus Paul sent messengers to the city of Ephesus and called the spiritual leaders 
ACT.20.18	 When they were with him, he said to them, “You know how I spent all my time with you from the first day I arrived in the province of Asia. 
ACT.20.19	 I humbly served the Lord, often with tears in my eyes. I served the Lord during the difficult times I went through when the Jews plotted against me. 
ACT.20.20	 I didn’t avoid telling you anything that would help you, and I didn’t avoid teaching you publicly and from house to house. 
ACT.20.21	 I warned Jews and Greeks to change the way they think and act and to believe in our Lord Jesus.
ACT.20.22	 “I am determined to go to Jerusalem now. I don’t know what will happen to me there. 
ACT.20.23	 However, the Holy Spirit warns me in every city that imprisonment and suffering are waiting for me. 
ACT.20.24	 But I don’t place any value on my own life. I want to finish the race I’m running. I want to carry out the mission I received from the Lord Jesus—the mission of testifying to the Good News of God’s kindness.
ACT.20.25	 “Now I know that none of you whom I told about the kingdom ⌊of God⌋ will see me again. 
ACT.20.26	 Therefore, I declare to you today that I am not responsible for the ⌊spiritual⌋ death of any of you. 
ACT.20.27	 I didn’t avoid telling you the whole plan of God. 
ACT.20.28	 Pay attention to yourselves and to the entire flock in which the Holy Spirit has placed you as bishops 
ACT.20.29	 I know that fierce wolves will come to you after I leave, and they won’t spare the flock. 
ACT.20.30	 Some of your own men will come forward and say things that distort the truth. They will do this to lure disciples into following them. 
ACT.20.31	 So be alert! Remember that I instructed each of you for three years, day and night, at times with tears in my eyes.
ACT.20.32	 “I am now entrusting you to God and to his message that tells how kind he is. That message can help you grow and can give you the inheritance that is shared by all of God’s holy people.
ACT.20.33	 “I never wanted anyone’s silver, gold, or clothes. 
ACT.20.34	 You know that I worked to support myself and those who were with me. 
ACT.20.35	 I have given you an example that by working hard like this we should help the weak. We should remember the words that the Lord Jesus said, ‘Giving gifts is more satisfying than receiving them.’ ”
ACT.20.36	 When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down and prayed with all of them. 
ACT.20.37	 Everyone cried a lot as they put their arms around Paul and kissed him. 
ACT.20.38	 The thought of not seeing Paul again hurt them most of all. Then they took Paul to the ship.
ACT.21.1	 When we finally left them, we sailed straight to the island of Cos. The next day we sailed to the island of Rhodes and from there to the city of Patara. 
ACT.21.2	 In Patara, we found a ship that was going to Phoenicia, so we went aboard and sailed away. 
ACT.21.3	 We could see the island of Cyprus as we passed it on our left and sailed to Syria. We landed at the city of Tyre, where the ship was to unload its cargo.
ACT.21.4	 In Tyre we searched for the disciples. After we found them, we stayed there for seven days. The Spirit had the disciples tell Paul not to go to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.5	 When our time was up, we started on our way. All of them with their wives and children accompanied us out of the city. We knelt on the beach, prayed, 
ACT.21.6	 and said goodbye to each other. Then we went aboard the ship, and the disciples went back home.
ACT.21.7	 Our sea travel ended when we sailed from Tyre to the city of Ptolemais. We greeted the believers in Ptolemais and spent the day with them. 
ACT.21.8	 The next day we went to Philip’s home in Caesarea and stayed with him. He was a missionary and one of the seven men who helped the apostles. 
ACT.21.9	 Philip had four unmarried daughters who had the ability to speak what God had revealed.
ACT.21.10	 After we had been there for a number of days, a prophet named Agabus arrived from Judea. 
ACT.21.11	 During his visit he took Paul’s belt and tied his own feet and hands with it. Then he said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘This is how the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this belt. Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jewish.’ ”
ACT.21.12	 When we heard this, we and the believers who lived there begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
ACT.21.13	 Then Paul replied, “Why are you crying like this and breaking my heart? I’m ready not only to be tied up in Jerusalem but also to die there for the sake of the Lord, the one named Jesus.”
ACT.21.14	 When Paul could not be persuaded, we dropped the issue and said, “May the Lord’s will be done.”
ACT.21.15	 After that, we got ready to go to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	 Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us. They took us to Mnason’s home, where we would be staying. Mnason was from the island of Cyprus and was one of the first disciples. 
ACT.21.17	 When we arrived in Jerusalem, the believers welcomed us warmly.
ACT.21.18	 The next day Paul went with us to visit James. All the spiritual leaders 
ACT.21.19	 After greeting them, Paul related everything God had done through his work with non-Jewish people.
ACT.21.20	 When the spiritual leaders heard about everything, they praised God. They said to Paul, “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews are now believers, and all of them are deeply committed to Moses’ Teachings. 
ACT.21.21	 But they have been told that you teach all the Jews living among non-Jewish people to abandon Moses. They claim that you tell them not to circumcise their children or follow Jewish customs. 
ACT.21.22	 What should we do about this? They will certainly hear that you’re in town. 
ACT.21.23	 So follow our advice. We have four men who have made a vow to God. 
ACT.21.24	 Take these men, go through the purification ceremony with them, and pay the expenses to shave their heads. Then everyone will know that what they’ve been told about you isn’t true. Instead, they’ll see that you carefully follow Moses’ Teachings.
ACT.21.25	 ⌊To clarify this matter⌋ we have written non-Jewish believers a letter with our decision. We told them that they should not eat food sacrificed to false gods, bloody meat, or the meat of strangled animals. They also should not commit sexual sins.”
ACT.21.26	 The next day, Paul took the men and went through the purification ceremony with them. Then he went into the temple courtyard to announce the time when the purification would be over and the sacrifice would be offered for each of them.
ACT.21.27	 When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul in the temple courtyard. They stirred up the whole crowd and grabbed Paul. 
ACT.21.28	 Then they began shouting, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere to turn against the Jewish people, Moses’ Teachings, and this temple. He has even brought Greeks into the temple courtyard and has made this holy place unclean.” 
ACT.21.29	 They had seen Trophimus from Ephesus with him in the city earlier and thought Paul had taken him into the temple courtyard.
ACT.21.30	 The whole city was in chaos, and a mob formed. The mob grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the temple courtyard. The courtyard doors were immediately shut.
ACT.21.31	 As the people were trying to kill Paul, the officer in charge of the Roman soldiers received a report that all Jerusalem was rioting. 
ACT.21.32	 Immediately, he took some soldiers and officers and charged the crowd. When the crowd saw the officer and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 
ACT.21.33	 Then the officer went to Paul, grabbed him, and ordered him to be tied up with two chains.
ACT.21.33	The officer asked who Paul was and what he had done. 
ACT.21.34	 Some of the crowd shouted one thing, while others shouted something else. The officer couldn’t get any facts because of the noise and confusion, so he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks. 
ACT.21.35	 When Paul came to the stairs of the barracks, the crowd was so violent that the soldiers had to carry him. 
ACT.21.36	 The mob was behind them shouting, “Kill him!”
ACT.21.37	 As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the officer, “May I say something to you?”
ACT.21.37	The officer replied to Paul, “Can you speak Greek? 
ACT.21.38	 Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolution not long ago and led four thousand terrorists into the desert?”
ACT.21.39	 Paul answered, “I’m a Jew, a citizen from the well-known city of Tarsus in Cilicia. I’m asking you to let me talk to the people.”
ACT.21.40	 The officer gave Paul permission to speak. So Paul stood on the stairs of the barracks and motioned with his hand for the people to be quiet. When the mob was silent, Paul spoke to them in the Hebrew language.
ACT.22.1	 “Brothers and fathers, listen as I now present my case to you.”
ACT.22.2	 When the mob heard him speak to them in Hebrew, they became even more quiet. Then Paul continued, 
ACT.22.3	 “I’m a Jew. I was born and raised in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia and received my education from Gamaliel here in Jerusalem. My education was in the strict laws handed down by our ancestors. I was as devoted to God as all of you are today. 
ACT.22.4	 I persecuted people who followed the way ⌊of Christ⌋: I tied up men and women and put them into prison until they were executed. 
ACT.22.5	 The chief priest and the entire council of our leaders can prove that I did this. In fact, they even gave me letters to take to the Jewish community in the city of Damascus. I was going there to tie up believers and bring them back to Jerusalem to punish them.
ACT.22.6	 “But as I was on my way and approaching the city of Damascus about noon, a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me. 
ACT.22.7	 I fell to the ground and heard a voice asking me, ‘Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me?’
ACT.22.8	 “I answered, ‘Who are you, sir?’
ACT.22.8	“The person told me, ‘I’m Jesus from Nazareth, the one you’re persecuting.’
ACT.22.9	 “The men who were with me saw the light but didn’t understand what the person who was speaking to me said.
ACT.22.10	 “Then I asked, ‘What do you want me to do, Lord?’
ACT.22.10	“The Lord told me, ‘Get up! Go into the city of Damascus, and you’ll be told everything I’ve arranged for you to do.’
ACT.22.11	 “I was blind because the light had been so bright. So the men who were with me led me into the city of Damascus.
ACT.22.12	 “A man named Ananias lived in Damascus. He was a devout person who followed Moses’ Teachings. All the Jews living in Damascus spoke highly of him. 
ACT.22.13	 He came to me, stood beside me, and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ At that moment my sight came back and I could see Ananias.
ACT.22.14	 “Ananias said, ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see the one who has God’s approval, and to hear him speak to you. 
ACT.22.15	 You will be his witness and will tell everyone what you have seen and heard. 
ACT.22.16	 What are you waiting for now? Get up! Be baptized, and have your sins washed away as you call on his name.’
ACT.22.17	 “After that, I returned to Jerusalem. While I was praying in the temple courtyard, I fell into a trance 
ACT.22.18	 and saw the Lord. He told me, ‘Hurry! Get out of Jerusalem immediately. The people here won’t accept your testimony about me.’
ACT.22.19	 “I said, ‘Lord, people here know that I went from synagogue to synagogue to imprison and whip those who believe in you. 
ACT.22.20	 When Stephen, who witnessed about you, was being killed, I was standing there. I approved of his death and guarded the coats of those who were murdering him.’
ACT.22.21	 “But the Lord told me, ‘Go! I’ll send you on a mission. You’ll go far away to people who aren’t Jewish.’ ”
ACT.22.22	 Up to that point the mob listened. Then they began to shout, “Kill him! The world doesn’t need a man like this. He shouldn’t have been allowed to live this long!”
ACT.22.23	 The mob was yelling, taking off their coats, and throwing dirt into the air. 
ACT.22.24	 So the officer ordered the soldiers to take Paul into the barracks and told them to question Paul as they whipped him. The officer wanted to find out why the people were yelling at Paul like this. 
ACT.22.25	 But when the soldiers had Paul stretch out ⌊to tie him to the whipping post⌋ with the straps, Paul asked the sergeant who was standing there, “Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn’t had a trial?”
ACT.22.26	 When the sergeant heard this, he reported it to his commanding officer. The sergeant asked him, “What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen.”
ACT.22.27	 The officer went to Paul and asked him, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”
ACT.22.27	Paul answered, “Yes.”
ACT.22.28	 The officer replied, “I paid a lot of money to become a Roman citizen.”
ACT.22.28	Paul replied, “But I was born a Roman citizen.”
ACT.22.29	 Immediately, the soldiers who were going to question Paul stepped away from him. The officer was afraid when he found out that he had tied up a Roman citizen.
ACT.22.30	 The officer wanted to find out exactly what accusation the Jews had against Paul. So the officer released Paul the next day and ordered the chief priests and the entire Jewish council to meet. Then the officer brought Paul and had him stand in front of them.
ACT.23.1	 Paul stared at the Jewish council and said, “Brothers, my relationship with God has always given me a perfectly clear conscience.”
ACT.23.2	 The chief priest Ananias ordered the men standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. 
ACT.23.3	 Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you hypocrite! You sit there and judge me by Moses’ Teachings and yet you break those teachings by ordering these men to strike me!”
ACT.23.4	 The men standing near Paul said to him, “You’re insulting God’s chief priest!”
ACT.23.5	 Paul answered, “Brothers, I didn’t know that he is the chief priest. After all, Scripture says, ‘Don’t speak evil about a ruler of your people.’ ”
ACT.23.6	 When Paul saw that some of them were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he shouted in the council, “Brothers, I’m a Pharisee and a descendant of Pharisees. I’m on trial because I expect that the dead will come back to life.”
ACT.23.7	 After Paul said that, the Pharisees and Sadducees began to quarrel, and the men in the meeting were divided. 
ACT.23.8	 (The Sadducees say that the dead won’t come back to life and that angels and spirits don’t exist. The Pharisees believe in all these things.) 
ACT.23.9	 The shouting became very loud. Some of the experts in Moses’ Teachings were Pharisees who argued their position forcefully. They said, “We don’t find anything wrong with this man. Maybe a spirit or an angel actually spoke to him!”
ACT.23.10	 The quarrel was becoming violent, and the officer was afraid that they would tear Paul to pieces. So the officer ordered his soldiers to drag Paul back to the barracks.
ACT.23.11	 The Lord stood near Paul the next night and said to him, “Don’t lose your courage! You’ve told the truth about me in Jerusalem. Now you must tell the truth about me in Rome.”
ACT.23.12	 In the morning the Jews formed a conspiracy. They asked God to curse them if they ate or drank anything before they had killed Paul. 
ACT.23.13	 More than forty men took part in this plot.
ACT.23.14	 They went to the chief priests and leaders ⌊of the people⌋ and said, “We’ve asked God to curse us if we taste any food before we’ve killed Paul. 
ACT.23.15	 Here’s our plan: You and the council must go to the Roman officer on the pretext that you need more information from Paul. You have to make it look as though you want to get more accurate information about him. We’ll be ready to kill him before he gets to you.”
ACT.23.16	 But Paul’s nephew heard about the ambush. He entered the barracks and told Paul. 
ACT.23.17	 Then Paul called one of the sergeants and told him, “Take this young man to the officer. He has something to tell him.”
ACT.23.18	 The sergeant took the young man to the officer and said, “The prisoner Paul called me. He asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”
ACT.23.19	 The officer took the young man by the arm, went where they could be alone, and asked him, “What do you have to tell me?”
ACT.23.20	 The young man answered, “The Jews have planned to ask you to bring Paul to the Jewish council tomorrow. They’re going to make it look as though they want more accurate information about him. 
ACT.23.21	 Don’t let them persuade you to do this. More than forty of them are planning to ambush him. They have asked God to curse them if they eat or drink anything before they have murdered him. They are ready now and are expecting you to promise ⌊that you will bring Paul⌋.”
ACT.23.22	 The officer dismissed the young man and ordered him not to tell this information to anyone else.
ACT.23.23	 Then the officer summoned two of his sergeants and told them, “I want 200 infantrymen, 70 soldiers on horseback, and 200 soldiers with spears. Have them ready to go to Caesarea at nine o’clock tonight. 
ACT.23.24	 Provide an animal for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Governor Felix.” 
ACT.23.25	 The officer wrote a letter to the governor with the following message:
ACT.23.26	 Claudius Lysias sends greetings to Your Excellency, Governor Felix:
ACT.23.27	 The Jews had seized this man and were going to murder him. When I found out that he was a Roman citizen, I went with my soldiers to rescue him. 
ACT.23.28	 I wanted to know what they had against him. So I took him to their Jewish council 
ACT.23.29	 and found their accusations had to do with disputes about their own laws. He wasn’t accused of anything for which he deserved to die or to be put into prison. 
ACT.23.30	 Since I was informed that there was a plot against this man, I immediately sent him to you. I have also ordered his accusers to state their case against him in front of you.
ACT.23.31	 So the infantrymen did as they had been ordered. They took Paul to the city of Antipatris during the night. 
ACT.23.32	 They returned to their barracks the next day and let the soldiers on horseback travel with Paul. 
ACT.23.33	 When the soldiers arrived in the city of Caesarea with Paul, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.
ACT.23.34	 After the governor had read the letter, he asked Paul which province he was from. When he found out that Paul was from the province of Cilicia, 
ACT.23.35	 he said, “I’ll hear your case when your accusers arrive.” Then the governor gave orders to keep Paul under guard in Herod’s palace.
ACT.24.1	 Five days later the chief priest Ananias went to the city of Caesarea with some leaders of the people and an attorney named Tertullus. They reported to the governor their charges against Paul.
ACT.24.2	 When Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him. He said to Felix, “Your Excellency, through your wise leadership we have lasting peace and reforms that benefit the people. 
ACT.24.3	 We appreciate what you’ve done in every way and in every place, and we want to thank you very much. 
ACT.24.4	 I don’t want to keep you too long. Please listen to us. We will be brief. 
ACT.24.5	 We have found this man to be a troublemaker. He starts quarrels among all Jews throughout the world. He’s a ringleader of the Nazarene sect. 
ACT.24.6	 He also entered the temple courtyard in a way that violates our tradition. So we arrested him.
ACT.24.8	 When you cross-examine him, you’ll be able to find out from him that our accusations are true.”
ACT.24.9	 The Jews supported Tertullus’ accusations and asserted that everything Tertullus said was true.
ACT.24.10	 The governor motioned for Paul to speak. Paul responded, “I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years. So I’m pleased to present my case to you. 
ACT.24.11	 You can verify for yourself that I went to Jerusalem to worship no more than twelve days ago. 
ACT.24.12	 No one found me having a discussion with anyone in the temple courtyard or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues throughout the city. 
ACT.24.13	 These people cannot even prove their accusations to you. 
ACT.24.14	 But I’ll admit to you that I’m a follower of the way ⌊of Christ⌋, which they call a sect. This means that I serve our ancestors’ God and believe everything written in Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets. 
ACT.24.15	 I hope for the same thing my accusers do, that people with God’s approval and those without it will come back to life. 
ACT.24.16	 With this belief I always do my best to have a clear conscience in the sight of God and people. 
ACT.24.17	 After many years I have come back to my people and brought gifts for the poor and offerings ⌊for God⌋. 
ACT.24.18	 My accusers found me in the temple courtyard doing these things after I had gone through the purification ceremony. No crowd or noisy mob was present. 
ACT.24.19	 But some Jews from the province of Asia were there. They should be here in front of you to accuse me if they have anything against me. 
ACT.24.20	 Otherwise, these men who are accusing me should tell what I was charged with when I stood in front of their council. 
ACT.24.21	 They could accuse me of only one thing. As I stood among them, I shouted, ‘I’m being tried in front of you because ⌊I believe that⌋ the dead will come back to life.’ ”
ACT.24.22	 Felix knew the way ⌊of Christ⌋ rather well, so he adjourned the trial. He told them, “When the officer Lysias arrives, I’ll decide your case.” 
ACT.24.23	 Felix ordered the sergeant to guard Paul but to let him have some freedom and to let his friends take care of his needs.
ACT.24.24	 Some days later Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him talk about faith in Christ Jesus. 
ACT.24.25	 As Paul discussed the subjects of God’s approval, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and said, “That’s enough for now. You can go. When I find time, I’ll send for you again.” 
ACT.24.26	 At the same time, Felix was hoping that Paul would give him some money. For that reason, Felix would send for Paul rather often to have friendly conversations with him.
ACT.24.27	 Two years passed. Then Porcius Festus took Felix’s place. (Since Felix wanted to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in prison.)
ACT.25.1	 Three days after Festus took over his duties in the province of Judea, he went from the city of Caesarea to Jerusalem. 
ACT.25.2	 The chief priests and the other important Jewish leaders informed Festus about their charges against Paul. They were urging 
ACT.25.3	 Festus to do them the favor of having Paul brought to Jerusalem. The Jews had a plan to ambush and kill Paul as he traveled to Jerusalem.
ACT.25.4	 Festus replied that he would be returning to Caesarea soon and would keep Paul there. 
ACT.25.5	 He told them, “Have your authorities come to Caesarea with me and accuse him there if the man has done something wrong.”
ACT.25.6	 Festus stayed in Jerusalem for eight or ten days at the most and then returned to Caesarea. The next day Festus took his place in court and summoned Paul.
ACT.25.7	 When Paul entered the room, the Jews who had come from Jerusalem surrounded him. They made a lot of serious accusations that they couldn’t prove. 
ACT.25.8	 Paul defended himself by saying, “I haven’t broken any Jewish law or done anything against the temple or the emperor.”
ACT.25.9	 But Festus wanted to do the Jews a favor. So he asked Paul, “Are you willing to go to Jerusalem to be tried there on these charges with me as your judge?”
ACT.25.10	 Paul said, “I am standing in the emperor’s court where I must be tried. I haven’t done anything wrong to the Jews, as you know very well. 
ACT.25.11	 If I am guilty and have done something wrong for which I deserve the death penalty, I don’t reject the idea of dying. But if their accusations are untrue, no one can hand me over to them as a favor. I appeal my case to the emperor!”
ACT.25.12	 Festus discussed the appeal with his advisers and then replied to Paul, “You have appealed your case to the emperor, so you’ll go to the emperor!”
ACT.25.13	 Later King Agrippa and Bernice came to the city of Caesarea to welcome Festus. 
ACT.25.14	 Since they were staying there for a number of days, Festus told the king about Paul’s case.
ACT.25.14	Festus said, “Felix left a man here in prison. 
ACT.25.15	 When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the Jewish leaders brought me some information about him and asked me to condemn him.
ACT.25.16	 “I replied to them, ‘That’s not the Roman way of doing things. A person can’t be sentenced as a favor. Before he is sentenced, he must face his accusers and have a chance to defend himself against their accusation.’
ACT.25.17	 “So the Jewish leaders came to Caesarea with me. The next day I immediately convened court and summoned the man. 
ACT.25.18	 When his accusers stood up, they didn’t accuse him of the crimes I was expecting. 
ACT.25.19	 They were disputing with him about their own religion and about some man named Jesus who had died. But Paul claimed that Jesus is alive. 
ACT.25.20	 Their debate about these things left me puzzled. So I asked Paul if he would like to go to Jerusalem to have his case heard there. 
ACT.25.21	 But Paul appealed his case. He asked to be held in prison and to have His Majesty the Emperor decide his case. So I ordered him to be held in prison until I could send him to the emperor.”
ACT.25.22	 Agrippa told Festus, “I would like to hear the man.”
ACT.25.22	Festus replied, “You’ll hear him to morrow.”
ACT.25.23	 The next day Agrippa and Bernice entered the auditorium with a lot of fanfare. Roman army officers and the most important men of the city entered the auditorium with them. Festus gave the order, and Paul was brought into the auditorium.
ACT.25.24	 Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and everyone who is present with us! All the Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea have talked to me about this man you see in front of you. They shout that he must not be allowed to live any longer. 
ACT.25.25	 However, I don’t think that he has done anything to deserve the death penalty. But since he made an appeal to His Majesty the Emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome. 
ACT.25.26	 But I don’t have anything reliable to write our emperor about him. So I have brought him to all of you, and especially to you, King Agrippa. Then I’ll have something to write after he is cross-examined. 
ACT.25.27	 I find it ridiculous to send a prisoner to Rome when I can’t specify any charges against him.”
ACT.26.1	 Agrippa said to Paul, “You’re free to speak for yourself.”
ACT.26.1	Paul acknowledged King Agrippa and then began his defense. 
ACT.26.2	 “King Agrippa, I think I’m fortunate today to stand in front of you and defend myself against every charge that the Jews brought against me. 
ACT.26.3	 I say this since you are especially familiar with every custom and controversy in Judaism. So I ask you to listen patiently to me.
ACT.26.4	 “All the Jews know how I lived the earliest days of my youth with my own people and in Jerusalem. 
ACT.26.5	 They’ve known me for a long time and can testify, if they’re willing, that I followed the strictest party of our religion. They know that I lived my life as a Pharisee.
ACT.26.6	 “I’m on trial now because I expect God to keep the promise that he made to our ancestors. 
ACT.26.7	 Our twelve tribes expect this promise to be kept as they worship with intense devotion day and night. Your Majesty, the Jews are making accusations against me because I expect God to keep his promise. 
ACT.26.8	 Why do all of you refuse to believe that God can bring dead people back to life?
ACT.26.9	 “I used to think that I had to do a lot of things to oppose the one named Jesus of Nazareth. 
ACT.26.10	 That is what I did in Jerusalem. By the authority I received from the chief priests, I locked many Christians in prison. I voted to have them killed every time a vote was taken. 
ACT.26.11	 I even went to each synagogue, punished believers, and forced them to curse ⌊the name of Jesus⌋. In my furious rage against them, I hunted them down in cities outside ⌊Jerusalem⌋.
ACT.26.12	 “I was carrying out these activities when I went to the city of Damascus. I had the power and authority of the chief priests. 
ACT.26.13	 Your Majesty, at noon, while I was traveling, I saw a light that was brighter than the sun. The light came from the sky and shined around me and those who were with me. 
ACT.26.14	 All of us fell to the ground, and I heard a voice asking me in Hebrew, ‘Saul, Saul! Why are you persecuting me? It’s hard for ⌊a mortal like⌋ you to resist God.’
ACT.26.15	 “I asked, ‘Who are you, sir?’
ACT.26.15	“The Lord answered, ‘I am Jesus, the one you’re persecuting. 
ACT.26.16	 Stand up! I have appeared to you for a reason. I’m appointing you to be a servant and witness of what you have seen and of what I will show you. 
ACT.26.17	 I will rescue you from the Jewish people and from the non-Jewish people to whom I am sending you. 
ACT.26.18	 You will open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from Satan’s control to God’s. Then they will receive forgiveness for their sins and a share among God’s people who are made holy by believing in me.’
ACT.26.19	 “At that point I did not disobey the vision I saw from heaven, King Agrippa. 
ACT.26.20	 Instead, I spread the message that I first told to the ⌊Jewish⌋ people in Damascus and Jerusalem and throughout the whole country of Judea. I spread the same message to non-Jewish people. Both groups were expected to change the way they thought and acted and to turn to God. I told them to do things that prove they had changed their lives. 
ACT.26.21	 For this reason the Jews took me prisoner in the temple courtyard and tried to murder me.
ACT.26.22	 “God has been helping me to this day so that I can stand and testify to important and unimportant people. I tell them only what the prophets and Moses said would happen. 
ACT.26.23	 They said that the Messiah would suffer and be the first to come back to life and would spread light to Jewish and non-Jewish people.”
ACT.26.24	 As Paul was defending himself in this way, Festus shouted, “Paul, you’re crazy! Too much education is driving you crazy!”
ACT.26.25	 Paul replied, “I’m not crazy, Your Excellency Festus. What I’m saying is true and sane. 
ACT.26.26	 I can easily speak to a king who knows about these things. I’m sure that none of these things has escaped his attention. None of this was done secretly. 
ACT.26.27	 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them!”
ACT.26.28	 Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think you can quickly persuade me to become a Christian?”
ACT.26.29	 Paul replied, “I wish to God that you and everyone listening to me today would quickly and completely become as I am (except for being a prisoner).”
ACT.26.30	 The king, the governor, Bernice, and the people who were sitting with them got up. 
ACT.26.31	 As they were leaving, they said to each other, “This man isn’t doing anything for which he deserves to die or be put in prison.”
ACT.26.32	 Agrippa told Festus, “This man could have been set free if he hadn’t appealed his case to the emperor.”
ACT.27.1	 When it was decided that we should sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were turned over to an army officer. His name was Julius, and he belonged to the emperor’s division. 
ACT.27.2	 We set sail on a ship from the city of Adramyttium. The ship was going to stop at ports on the coast of the province of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from the city of Thessalonica, went with us.
ACT.27.3	 The next day we arrived at the city of Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to visit his friends and receive any care he needed. 
ACT.27.4	 Leaving Sidon, we sailed on the northern side of the island of Cyprus because we were traveling against the wind. 
ACT.27.5	 We sailed along the coast of the provinces of Cilicia and Pamphylia and arrived at the city of Myra in the province of Lycia. 
ACT.27.6	 In Myra the officer found a ship from Alexandria that was on its way to Italy and put us on it. 
ACT.27.7	 We were sailing slowly for a number of days. Our difficulties began along the coast of the city of Cnidus because the wind would not let us go further. So at Cape Salmone, we started to sail for the south side of the island of Crete. 
ACT.27.8	 We had difficulty sailing along the shore of Crete. We finally came to a port called Fair Harbors. The port was near the city of Lasea.
ACT.27.9	 We had lost so much time that the day of fasting had already past. Sailing was now dangerous, so Paul advised them, 
ACT.27.10	 “Men, we’re going to face a disaster and heavy losses on this voyage. This disaster will cause damage to the cargo and the ship, and it will affect our lives.” 
ACT.27.11	 However, the officer was persuaded by what the pilot and the owner of the ship said and not by what Paul said. 
ACT.27.12	 Since the harbor was not a good place to spend the winter, most of the men decided to sail from there. They hoped to reach the city of Phoenix somehow and spend the winter there. (Phoenix is a harbor that faces the southwest and northwest winds and is located on the island of Crete.)
ACT.27.13	 When a gentle breeze began to blow from the south, the men thought their plan would work. They raised the anchor and sailed close to the shore of Crete.
ACT.27.14	 Soon a powerful wind (called a northeaster) blew from the island. 
ACT.27.15	 The wind carried the ship away, and we couldn’t sail against the wind. We couldn’t do anything, so we were carried along by the wind. 
ACT.27.16	 As we drifted to the sheltered side of a small island called Cauda, we barely got control of the ship’s lifeboat. 
ACT.27.17	 The men pulled it up on deck. Then they passed ropes under the ship to reinforce it. Fearing that they would hit the large sandbank off the shores of Libya, they lowered the sail and were carried along by the wind. 
ACT.27.18	 We continued to be tossed so violently by the storm that the next day the men began to throw the cargo overboard. 
ACT.27.19	 On the third day they threw the ship’s equipment overboard. 
ACT.27.20	 For a number of days we couldn’t see the sun or the stars. The storm wouldn’t let up. It was so severe that we finally began to lose any hope of coming out of it alive.
ACT.27.21	 Since hardly anyone wanted to eat, Paul stood among them and said, “Men, you should have followed my advice not to sail from Crete. You would have avoided this disaster and loss. 
ACT.27.22	 Now I advise you to have courage. No one will lose his life. Only the ship will be destroyed. 
ACT.27.23	 I know this because an angel from the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood by me last night. 
ACT.27.24	 The angel told me, ‘Don’t be afraid, Paul! You must present your case to the emperor. God has granted safety to everyone who is sailing with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	 So have courage, men! I trust God that everything will turn out as he told me. 
ACT.27.26	 However, we will run aground on some island.”
ACT.27.27	 On the fourteenth night we were still drifting through the Mediterranean Sea. About midnight the sailors suspected that we were approaching land. 
ACT.27.28	 So they threw a line with a weight on it into the water. It sank 120 feet. They waited a little while and did the same thing again. This time the line sank 90 feet. 
ACT.27.29	 Fearing we might hit rocks, they dropped four anchors from the back of the ship and prayed for morning to come.
ACT.27.30	 The sailors tried to escape from the ship. They let the lifeboat down into the sea and pretended they were going to lay out the anchors from the front of the ship. 
ACT.27.31	 Paul told the officer and the soldiers, “If these sailors don’t stay on the ship, you have no hope of staying alive.” 
ACT.27.32	 Then the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away.
ACT.27.33	 Just before daybreak Paul was encouraging everyone to have something to eat. “This is the fourteenth day you have waited and have had nothing to eat. 
ACT.27.34	 So I’m encouraging you to eat something. Eating will help you survive, since not a hair from anyone’s head will be lost.” 
ACT.27.35	 After Paul said this, he took some bread, thanked God in front of everyone, broke it, and began to eat. 
ACT.27.36	 Everyone was encouraged and had something to eat. 
ACT.27.37	 (There were 276 of us on the ship.) 
ACT.27.38	 After the people had eaten all they wanted, they lightened the ship by dumping the wheat into the sea.
ACT.27.39	 In the morning they couldn’t recognize the land, but they could see a bay with a beach. So they decided to try to run the ship ashore. 
ACT.27.40	 They cut the anchors free and left them in the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars. Then they raised the top sail to catch the wind and steered the ship to the shore. 
ACT.27.41	 They struck a sandbar in the water and ran the ship aground. The front of the ship stuck and couldn’t be moved, while the back of the ship was broken to pieces by the force of the waves.
ACT.27.42	 The soldiers had a plan to kill the prisoners to keep them from swimming away and escaping. 
ACT.27.43	 However, the officer wanted to save Paul, so he stopped the soldiers from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and swim ashore. 
ACT.27.44	 Then he ordered the rest to follow on planks or some other pieces ⌊of wood⌋ from the ship. In this way everyone got to shore safely.
ACT.28.1	 When we were safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta. 
ACT.28.2	 The people who lived on the island were unusually kind to us. They made a fire and welcomed all of us around it because of the rain and the cold.
ACT.28.3	 Paul gathered a bundle of brushwood and put it on the fire. The heat forced a poisonous snake out of the brushwood. The snake bit Paul’s hand and wouldn’t let go. 
ACT.28.4	 When the people who lived on the island saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, “This man must be a murderer! He may have escaped from the sea, but justice won’t let him live.”
ACT.28.5	 Paul shook the snake into the fire and wasn’t harmed. 
ACT.28.6	 The people were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. But after they had waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
ACT.28.7	 A man named Publius, who was the governor of the island, had property around the area. He welcomed us and treated us kindly, and for three days we were his guests. 
ACT.28.8	 His father happened to be sick in bed. He was suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went to him, prayed, placed his hands on him, and made him well.
ACT.28.9	 After that had happened, other sick people on the island went to Paul and were made well. 
ACT.28.10	 They showed respect for us in many ways, and when we were going to set sail, they put whatever we needed on board.
ACT.28.11	 After three months we sailed on an Alexandrian ship that had spent the winter at the island. The ship had the gods Castor and Pollux carved on its front. 
ACT.28.12	 We stopped at the city of Syracuse and stayed there for three days. 
ACT.28.13	 We sailed from Syracuse and arrived at the city of Rhegium. The next day a south wind began to blow, and two days later we arrived at the city of Puteoli. 
ACT.28.14	 In Puteoli we discovered some believers who begged us to spend a week with them.
ACT.28.15	 Believers in Rome heard that we were coming, so they came as far as the cities of Appius’ Market and Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and felt encouraged. So we finally arrived in the city of Rome.
ACT.28.16	 After our arrival, Paul was allowed to live by himself, but he had a soldier who guarded him.
ACT.28.17	 After three days Paul invited the most influential Jews in Rome to meet with him. When they assembled, he said to them, “Brothers, I haven’t done anything against the Jewish people or violated the customs handed down by our ancestors. Yet, I’m a prisoner from Jerusalem, and I’ve been handed over to the Roman authorities. 
ACT.28.18	 The Roman authorities cross-examined me and wanted to let me go because I was accused of nothing for which I deserved to die. 
ACT.28.19	 But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal my case to the emperor. That doesn’t mean I have any charges to bring against my own people. 
ACT.28.20	 That’s why I asked to see you and speak with you. I’m wearing these chains because of what Israel hopes for.”
ACT.28.21	 The Jewish leaders told Paul, “We haven’t received any letters from Judea about you, and no Jewish person who has come to Rome has reported or mentioned anything bad about you. 
ACT.28.22	 However, we would like to hear what you think. We know that everywhere people are talking against this sect.”
ACT.28.23	 On a designated day a larger number of influential Jews ⌊than expected⌋ went to the place where Paul was staying. From morning until evening, Paul was explaining the kingdom of God to them. He was trying to convince them about Jesus from Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets. 
ACT.28.24	 Some of them were convinced by what he said, but others continued to disbelieve.
ACT.28.25	 The Jews, unable to agree among themselves, left after Paul had quoted this particular passage to them: “How well the Holy Spirit spoke to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah! 
ACT.28.26	 The Spirit said: ‘Go to these people and say,
ACT.28.26	“You will hear clearly but never understand.
ACT.28.26	You will see clearly but never comprehend.
ACT.28.27	 These people have become close-minded
ACT.28.27	and hard of hearing.
ACT.28.27	They have shut their eyes
ACT.28.27	so that their eyes never see.
ACT.28.27	Their ears never hear.
ACT.28.27	Their minds never understand.
ACT.28.27	And they never turn to me for healing.” ’
ACT.28.28	 “You need to know that God has sent his salvation to people who are not Jews. They will listen.” 
ACT.28.30	 Paul rented a place to live for two full years and welcomed everyone who came to him. 
ACT.28.31	 He spread the message about God’s kingdom and taught very boldly about the Lord Jesus Christ. No one stopped him.
ROM.1.1	 From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle and appointed to spread the Good News of God.
ROM.1.2	 (God had already promised this Good News through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures. 
ROM.1.3	 This Good News is about his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.4	 In his spiritual, holy nature he was declared the Son of God. This was shown in a powerful way when he came back to life. 
ROM.1.5	 Through him we have received God’s kindness 
ROM.1.6	 You are among those who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.)
ROM.1.7	 To everyone in Rome whom God loves and has called to be his holy people.
ROM.1.7	Good will 
ROM.1.8	 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for every one of you because the news of your faith is spreading throughout the whole world. 
ROM.1.9	 I serve God by spreading the Good News about his Son. God is my witness that I always mention you 
ROM.1.10	 every time I pray. I ask that somehow God will now at last make it possible for me to visit you. 
ROM.1.11	 I long to see you to share a spiritual blessing with you so that you will be strengthened. 
ROM.1.12	 What I mean is that we may be encouraged by each other’s faith.
ROM.1.13	 I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that I often planned to visit you. However, until now I have been kept from doing so. What I want is to enjoy some of the results of working among you as I have also enjoyed the results of working among the rest of the nations. 
ROM.1.14	 I have an obligation to those who are civilized and those who aren’t, to those who are wise and those who aren’t. 
ROM.1.15	 That’s why I’m eager to tell you who live in Rome the Good News also.
ROM.1.16	 I’m not ashamed of the Good News. It is God’s power to save everyone who believes, Jews first and Greeks as well. 
ROM.1.17	 God’s approval is revealed in this Good News. This approval begins and ends with faith as Scripture says, “The person who has God’s approval will live by faith.”
ROM.1.18	 God’s anger is revealed from heaven against every ungodly and immoral thing people do as they try to suppress the truth by their immoral living. 
ROM.1.19	 What can be known about God is clear to them because he has made it clear to them. 
ROM.1.20	 From the creation of the world, God’s invisible qualities, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly observed in what he made. As a result, people have no excuse. 
ROM.1.21	 They knew God but did not praise and thank him for being God. Instead, their thoughts were pointless, and their misguided minds were plunged into darkness. 
ROM.1.22	 While claiming to be wise, they became fools. 
ROM.1.23	 They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for statues that looked like mortal humans, birds, animals, and snakes.
ROM.1.24	 For this reason God allowed their lusts to control them. As a result, they dishonor their bodies by sexual perversion with each other. 
ROM.1.25	 These people have exchanged God’s truth for a lie. So they have become ungodly and serve what is created rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen!
ROM.1.26	 For this reason God allowed their shameful passions to control them. Their women have exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 
ROM.1.27	 Likewise, their men have given up natural sexual relations with women and burn with lust for each other. Men commit indecent acts with men, so they experience among themselves the punishment they deserve for their perversion.
ROM.1.28	 And because they thought it was worthless to acknowledge God, God allowed their own immoral minds to control them. So they do these indecent things. 
ROM.1.29	 Their lives are filled with all kinds of sexual sins, wickedness, and greed. They are mean. They are filled with envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and viciousness. They are gossips, 
ROM.1.30	 slanderers, haters of God, haughty, arrogant, and boastful. They think up new ways to be cruel. They don’t obey their parents, 
ROM.1.31	 don’t have any sense, don’t keep promises, and don’t show love to their own families or mercy to others. 
ROM.1.32	 Although they know God’s judgment that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only do these things but also approve of others who do them.
ROM.2.1	 No matter who you are, if you judge anyone, you have no excuse. When you judge another person, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the same things. 
ROM.2.2	 We know that God’s judgment is right when he condemns people for doing these things. 
ROM.2.3	 When you judge people for doing these things but then do them yourself, do you think you will escape God’s judgment? 
ROM.2.4	 Do you have contempt for God, who is very kind to you, puts up with you, and deals patiently with you? Don’t you realize that it is God’s kindness that is trying to lead you to him and change the way you think and act?
ROM.2.5	 Since you are stubborn and don’t want to change the way you think and act, you are adding to the anger that God will have against you on that day when God vents his anger. At that time God will reveal that his decisions are fair. 
ROM.2.6	 He will pay all people back for what they have done. 
ROM.2.7	 He will give everlasting life to those who search for glory, honor, and immortality by persisting in doing what is good. But he will bring 
ROM.2.8	 anger and fury on those who, in selfish pride, refuse to believe the truth and who follow what is wrong. 
ROM.2.9	 There will be suffering and distress for every person who does evil, for Jews first and Greeks as well. 
ROM.2.10	 But there will be glory, honor, and peace for every person who does what is good, for Jews first and Greeks as well. 
ROM.2.11	 God does not play favorites.
ROM.2.12	 Here’s the reason: Whoever sins without having the laws in Moses’ Teachings will still be condemned to destruction. And whoever has these laws from God and sins will still be judged by them. 
ROM.2.13	 People who merely listen to the laws in Moses’ Teachings don’t have God’s approval. Rather, people who do what those laws demand will have God’s approval.
ROM.2.14	 For example, whenever non-Jews who don’t have the laws in Moses’ Teachings do by nature the things that those laws contain, they are a law to themselves even though they don’t have any of those laws. 
ROM.2.15	 They show that some requirements found in Moses’ Teachings are written in their hearts. Their consciences speak to them. Their thoughts accuse them on one occasion and defend them on another. 
ROM.2.16	 This happens as they face the day when God, through Christ Jesus, will judge people’s secret thoughts. He will use the Good News that I am spreading to make that judgment.
ROM.2.17	 You call yourself a Jew, rely on the laws in Moses’ Teachings, brag about your God, 
ROM.2.18	 know what he wants, and distinguish right from wrong because you have been taught Moses’ Teachings. 
ROM.2.19	 You are confident that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in the dark, 
ROM.2.20	 an instructor of ignorant people, and a teacher of children because you have the full content of knowledge and truth in Moses’ Teachings. 
ROM.2.21	 As you teach others, are you failing to teach yourself? As you preach against stealing, are you stealing? 
ROM.2.22	 As you tell others not to commit adultery, are you committing adultery? As you treat idols with disgust, are you robbing temples? 
ROM.2.23	 As you brag about the laws in Moses’ Teachings, are you dishonoring God by ignoring those laws? 
ROM.2.24	 As Scripture says, “God’s name is cursed among the nations because of you.”
ROM.2.25	 For example, circumcision is valuable if you follow the laws in Moses’ Teachings. If you don’t follow those laws, your circumcision amounts to uncircumcision. 
ROM.2.26	 So if a man does what those laws demand, won’t he be considered circumcised even if he is uncircumcised? 
ROM.2.27	 The uncircumcised man who carries out what those laws say will condemn you for not following them. He will condemn you in spite of the fact that you are circumcised and have those laws in writing. 
ROM.2.28	 A person is not a Jew because of his appearance, nor is circumcision a matter of how the body looks. 
ROM.2.29	 Rather, a person is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is something that happens in a person’s heart. Circumcision is spiritual, not just a written rule. That person’s praise will come from God, not from people.
ROM.3.1	 Is there any advantage, then, in being a Jew? Or is there any value in being circumcised? 
ROM.3.2	 There are all kinds of advantages. First of all, God entrusted them with his word.
ROM.3.3	 What if some of them were unfaithful? Can their unfaithfulness cancel God’s faithfulness? 
ROM.3.4	 That would be unthinkable! God is honest, and everyone else is a liar, as Scripture says,
ROM.3.4	“So you hand down justice when you speak,
ROM.3.4	and you win your case in court.”
ROM.3.5	 But if what we do wrong shows that God is fair, what should we say? Is God unfair when he vents his anger on us? (I’m arguing the way humans would.) 
ROM.3.6	 That’s unthinkable! Otherwise, how would God be able to judge the world? 
ROM.3.7	 If my lie increases the glory that God receives by showing that God is truthful, why am I still judged as a sinner? 
ROM.3.8	 Or can we say, “Let’s do evil so that good will come from it”? Some slander us and claim that this is what we say. They are condemned, and that’s what they deserve.
ROM.3.9	 What, then, is the situation? Do we have any advantage? Not at all. We have already accused everyone (both Jews and Greeks) of being under the power of sin, 
ROM.3.10	 as Scripture says,
ROM.3.10	“Not one person has God’s approval.
ROM.3.11	 No one understands.
ROM.3.11	No one searches for God.
ROM.3.12	 Everyone has turned away.
ROM.3.12	Together they have become rotten to the core.
ROM.3.12	No one does anything good,
ROM.3.12	not even one person.
ROM.3.13	 Their throats are open graves.
ROM.3.13	Their tongues practice deception.
ROM.3.13	Their lips hide the venom of poisonous snakes.
ROM.3.14	 Their mouths are full of curses and bitter resentment.
ROM.3.15	 They run quickly to murder people.
ROM.3.16	 There is ruin and suffering wherever they go.
ROM.3.17	 They have not learned to live in peace.
ROM.3.18	 They are not terrified of God.”
ROM.3.19	 We know that whatever the Scriptures say applies to everyone under their influence, and no one can say a thing. The whole world is brought under the judgment of God. 
ROM.3.20	 Not one person can have God’s approval by any effort to follow the laws in the Scriptures. These laws show what sin is.
ROM.3.21	 Now, the way to receive God’s approval has been made plain in a way other than the laws in the Scriptures. Moses’ Teachings and the Prophets tell us this. 
ROM.3.22	 Everyone who believes has God’s approval through faith in Jesus Christ.
ROM.3.22	There is no difference between people. 
ROM.3.23	 Because all people have sinned, they have fallen short of God’s glory. 
ROM.3.24	 They receive God’s approval freely by an act of his kindness 
ROM.3.25	 God showed that Christ is the throne of mercy where God’s approval is given through faith in Christ’s blood. In his patience God waited to deal with sins committed in the past. 
ROM.3.26	 He waited so that he could display his approval at the present time. This shows that he is a God of justice, a God who approves of people who believe in Jesus.
ROM.3.27	 So, do we have anything to brag about? Bragging has been eliminated. On what basis was it eliminated? On the basis of our own efforts? No, indeed! Rather, it is eliminated on the basis of faith. 
ROM.3.28	 We conclude that a person has God’s approval by faith, not by his own efforts.
ROM.3.29	 Is God only the God of the Jews? Isn’t he also the God of people who are not Jewish? Certainly, he is, 
ROM.3.30	 since it is the same God who approves circumcised people by faith and uncircumcised people through this same faith.
ROM.3.31	 Are we abolishing the laws in the Scriptures by this faith? That’s unthinkable! Rather, we are supporting these laws.
ROM.4.1	 What can we say that we have discovered about our ancestor Abraham? 
ROM.4.2	 If Abraham had God’s approval because of something he did, he would have had a reason to brag. But he could not brag to God about it. 
ROM.4.3	 What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and that faith was regarded as the basis of Abraham’s approval by God.”
ROM.4.4	 When people work, their pay is not regarded as a gift but something they have earned. 
ROM.4.5	 However, when people don’t work but believe God, the one who approves ungodly people, their faith is regarded as the basis of God’s approval. 
ROM.4.6	 David says the same thing about those who are blessed: God approves of people without their earning it. David said,
ROM.4.7	 “Blessed are those whose disobedience is forgiven
ROM.4.7	and whose sins are pardoned.
ROM.4.8	 Blessed is the person whom the Lord no longer considers sinful.”
ROM.4.9	 Are only the circumcised people blessed, or are uncircumcised people blessed as well? We say, “Abraham’s faith was regarded as the basis of God’s approval.” 
ROM.4.10	 How was his faith regarded as the basis of God’s approval? Was he circumcised or was he uncircumcised at that time? He had not been circumcised. 
ROM.4.11	 Abraham’s faith was the basis of his approval by God while he was still uncircumcised. The mark of circumcision is the seal of that approval. Therefore, he is the father of every believer who is not circumcised, and their faith, too, is regarded as the basis of their approval by God. 
ROM.4.12	 He is also the father of those who not only are circumcised but also are following in the footsteps of his faith. Our father Abraham had that faith before he was circumcised.
ROM.4.13	 So it was not by obeying the laws in Moses’ Teachings that Abraham or his descendants received the promise that he would inherit the world. Rather, he received this promise through God’s approval that comes by faith. 
ROM.4.14	 If those who obey Moses’ Teachings are the heirs, then faith is useless and the promise is worthless. 
ROM.4.15	 The laws in Moses’ Teachings bring about anger. But where those laws don’t exist, they can’t be broken. 
ROM.4.16	 Therefore, the promise is based on faith so that it can be a gift.
ROM.4.17	 as Scripture says: “I have made you a father of many nations.”
ROM.4.17	Abraham believed when he stood in the presence of the God who gives life to dead people and calls into existence things that don’t even exist. 
ROM.4.18	 When there was nothing left to hope for, Abraham still hoped and believed. As a result, he became a father of many nations, as he had been told: “That is how many descendants you will have.” 
ROM.4.19	 Abraham didn’t weaken. Through faith he regarded the facts: His body was already as good as dead now that he was about a hundred years old, and Sarah was unable to have children. 
ROM.4.20	 He didn’t doubt God’s promise out of a lack of faith. Instead, giving honor to God ⌊for the promise⌋, he became strong because of faith 
ROM.4.21	 and was absolutely confident that God would do what he promised. 
ROM.4.22	 That is why Abraham’s faith was regarded as the basis of his approval by God.
ROM.4.23	 But the words “his faith was regarded as the basis of his approval by God” were written not only for him 
ROM.4.24	 but also for us. Our faith will be regarded as the basis of our approval by God—each of us who believe in the one who brought Jesus, our Lord, back to life. 
ROM.4.25	 Jesus, our Lord, was handed over to death because of our failures and was brought back to life so that we could receive God’s approval.
ROM.5.1	 Now that we have God’s approval by faith, we have peace with God because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done. 
ROM.5.2	 Through Christ we can approach God 
ROM.5.3	 But that’s not all. We also brag when we are suffering. We know that suffering creates endurance, 
ROM.5.4	 endurance creates character, and character creates confidence. 
ROM.5.5	 We’re not ashamed to have this confidence, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.
ROM.5.6	 Look at it this way: At the right time, while we were still helpless, Christ died for ungodly people. 
ROM.5.7	 Finding someone who would die for a godly person is rare. Maybe someone would have the courage to die for a good person. 
ROM.5.8	 Christ died for us while we were still sinners. This demonstrates God’s love for us.
ROM.5.9	 Since Christ’s blood has now given us God’s approval, we are even more certain that Christ will save us from God’s anger. 
ROM.5.10	 If the death of his Son restored our relationship with God while we were still his enemies, we are even more certain that, because of this restored relationship, the life of his Son will save us. 
ROM.5.11	 In addition, our Lord Jesus Christ lets us continue to brag about God. After all, it is through Christ that we now have this restored relationship with God.
ROM.5.12	 Sin came into the world through one person, and death came through sin. So death spread to everyone, because everyone sinned. 
ROM.5.13	 Sin was in the world before there were any laws. But no record of sin can be kept when there are no laws. 
ROM.5.14	 Yet, death ruled from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin in the same way Adam did when he disobeyed. Adam is an image of the one who would come.
ROM.5.15	 There is no comparison between ⌊God’s⌋ gift and ⌊Adam’s⌋ failure. If humanity died as the result of one person’s failure, it is certainly true that God’s kindness 
ROM.5.16	 There is also no comparison between ⌊God’s⌋ gift and the one who sinned. The verdict which followed one person’s failure condemned everyone. But, even after many failures, the gift brought God’s approval. 
ROM.5.17	 It is certain that death ruled because of one person’s failure. It’s even more certain that those who receive God’s overflowing kindness and the gift of his approval will rule in life because of one person, Jesus Christ.
ROM.5.18	 Therefore, everyone was condemned through one failure, and everyone received God’s life-giving approval through one verdict. 
ROM.5.19	 Clearly, through one person’s disobedience humanity became sinful, and through one person’s obedience humanity will receive God’s approval. 
ROM.5.20	 The laws in Moses’ Teachings were added to increase the failure. But where sin increased, God’s kindness increased even more. 
ROM.5.21	 As sin ruled by bringing death, God’s kindness would rule by bringing us his approval. This results in our living forever because of Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	 What should we say then? Should we continue to sin so that God’s kindness 
ROM.6.2	 That’s unthinkable! As far as sin is concerned, we have died. So how can we still live under sin’s influence?
ROM.6.3	 Don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 
ROM.6.4	 When we were baptized into his death, we were placed into the tomb with him. As Christ was brought back from death to life by the glorious power of the Father, so we, too, should live a new kind of life. 
ROM.6.5	 If we’ve become united with him in a death like his, certainly we will also be united with him when we come back to life as he did. 
ROM.6.6	 We know that the person we used to be was crucified with him to put an end to sin in our bodies. Because of this we are no longer slaves to sin. 
ROM.6.7	 The person who has died has been freed from sin.
ROM.6.8	 If we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 
ROM.6.9	 We know that Christ, who was brought back to life, will never die again. Death no longer has any power over him. 
ROM.6.10	 When he died, he died once and for all to sin’s power. But now he lives, and he lives for God. 
ROM.6.11	 So consider yourselves dead to sin’s power but living for God in the power Christ Jesus gives you.
ROM.6.12	 Therefore, never let sin rule your physical body so that you obey its desires. 
ROM.6.13	 Never offer any part of your body to sin’s power. No part of your body should ever be used to do any ungodly thing. Instead, offer yourselves to God as people who have come back from death and are now alive. Offer all the parts of your body to God. Use them to do everything that God approves of. 
ROM.6.14	 Certainly, sin shouldn’t have power over you because you’re not controlled by God’s laws, but by God’s favor.
ROM.6.15	 Then what is the implication? Should we sin because we are not controlled by God’s laws but by God’s favor? That’s unthinkable! 
ROM.6.16	 Don’t you know that if you offer to be someone’s slave, you must obey that master? Either your master is sin, or your master is obedience. Letting sin be your master leads to death. Letting obedience be your master leads to God’s approval. 
ROM.6.17	 You were slaves to sin. But I thank God that you have become wholeheartedly obedient to the teachings which you were given. 
ROM.6.18	 Freed from sin, you were made slaves who do what God approves of.
ROM.6.19	 I’m speaking in a human way because of the weakness of your corrupt nature. Clearly, you once offered all the parts of your body as slaves to sexual perversion and disobedience. This led you to live disobedient lives. Now, in the same way, offer all the parts of your body as slaves that do what God approves of. This leads you to live holy lives. 
ROM.6.20	 When you were slaves to sin, you were free from doing what God approves of.
ROM.6.21	 What did you gain by doing those things? You’re ashamed of what you used to do because it ended in death. 
ROM.6.22	 Now you have been freed from sin and have become God’s slaves. This results in a holy life and, finally, in everlasting life. 
ROM.6.23	 The payment for sin is death, but the gift that God freely gives is everlasting life found in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.7.1	 Don’t you realize, brothers and sisters, that laws have power over people only as long as they are alive? (I’m speaking to people who are familiar with Moses’ Teachings.) 
ROM.7.2	 For example, a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he is alive. But if her husband dies, that marriage law is no longer in effect for her. 
ROM.7.3	 So if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she will be called an adulterer. But if her husband dies, she is free from this law, so she is not committing adultery if she marries another man.
ROM.7.4	 In the same way, brothers and sisters, you have died to the laws in Moses’ Teachings through Christ’s body. You belong to someone else, the one who was brought back to life.
ROM.7.4	As a result, we can do what God wants. 
ROM.7.5	 While we were living under the influence of our corrupt nature, sinful passions were at work throughout our bodies. Stirred up by the laws in Moses’ Teachings, our sinful passions did things that result in death. 
ROM.7.6	 But now we have died to those laws that bound us. God has broken their effect on us so that we are serving in a new spiritual way, not in an old way dictated by written words.
ROM.7.7	 What should we say, then? Are the laws in Moses’ Teachings sinful? That’s unthinkable! In fact, I wouldn’t have recognized sin if those laws hadn’t shown it to me. For example, I wouldn’t have known that some desires are sinful if Moses’ Teachings hadn’t said, “Never have wrong desires.” 
ROM.7.8	 But sin took the opportunity provided by this commandment and made me have all kinds of wrong desires. Clearly, without laws sin is dead. 
ROM.7.9	 At one time I was alive without any laws. But when this commandment came, sin became alive 
ROM.7.10	 and I died. I found that the commandment which was intended to bring me life actually brought me death. 
ROM.7.11	 Sin, taking the opportunity provided by this commandment, deceived me and then killed me.
ROM.7.12	 So the laws in Moses’ Teachings are holy, and the commandment is holy, right, and good. 
ROM.7.13	 Now, did something good cause my death? That’s unthinkable! Rather, my death was caused by sin so that sin would be recognized for what it is. Through a commandment sin became more sinful than ever.
ROM.7.14	 I know that God’s standards in Moses’ Teachings are spiritual, but I have a corrupt nature, sold as a slave to sin. 
ROM.7.15	 I don’t realize what I’m doing. I don’t do what I want to do. Instead, I do what I hate. 
ROM.7.16	 I don’t do what I want to do, but I agree that God’s standards are good. 
ROM.7.17	 So I am no longer the one who is doing the things I hate, but sin that lives in me is doing them.
ROM.7.18	 I know that nothing good lives in me; that is, nothing good lives in my corrupt nature. Although I have the desire to do what is right, I don’t do it. 
ROM.7.19	 I don’t do the good I want to do. Instead, I do the evil that I don’t want to do. 
ROM.7.20	 Now, when I do what I don’t want to do, I am no longer the one who is doing it. Sin that lives in me is doing it.
ROM.7.21	 So I’ve discovered this truth: Evil is present with me even when I want to do what God’s standards say is good. 
ROM.7.22	 I take pleasure in God’s standards in my inner being. 
ROM.7.23	 However, I see a different standard ⌊at work⌋ throughout my body. It is at war with the standards my mind sets and tries to take me captive to sin’s standards which still exist throughout my body. 
ROM.7.24	 What a miserable person I am! Who will rescue me from my dying body? 
ROM.7.25	 I thank God that our Lord Jesus Christ rescues me! So I am obedient to God’s standards with my mind, but I am obedient to sin’s standards with my corrupt nature.
ROM.8.1	 So those who are believers in Christ Jesus can no longer be condemned. 
ROM.8.2	 The standards of the Spirit, who gives life through Christ Jesus, have set you free from the standards of sin and death. 
ROM.8.3	 It is impossible to do what God’s standards demand because of the weakness our human nature has. But God sent his Son to have a human nature as sinners have and to pay for sin. That way God condemned sin in our corrupt nature. 
ROM.8.4	 Therefore, we, who do not live by our corrupt nature but by our spiritual nature, are able to meet God’s standards in Moses’ Teachings.
ROM.8.5	 Those who live by the corrupt nature have the corrupt nature’s attitude. But those who live by the spiritual nature have the spiritual nature’s attitude. 
ROM.8.6	 The corrupt nature’s attitude leads to death. But the spiritual nature’s attitude leads to life and peace. 
ROM.8.7	 This is so because the corrupt nature has a hostile attitude toward God. It refuses to place itself under the authority of God’s standards because it can’t. 
ROM.8.8	 Those who are under the control of the corrupt nature can’t please God. 
ROM.8.9	 But if God’s Spirit lives in you, you are under the control of your spiritual nature, not your corrupt nature.
ROM.8.9	Whoever doesn’t have the Spirit of Christ doesn’t belong to him. 
ROM.8.10	 However, if Christ lives in you, your bodies are dead because of sin, but your spirits are alive because you have God’s approval. 
ROM.8.11	 Does the Spirit of the one who brought Jesus back to life live in you? Then the one who brought Christ back to life will also make your mortal bodies alive by his Spirit who lives in you.
ROM.8.12	 So, brothers and sisters, we have no obligation to live the way our corrupt nature wants us to live. 
ROM.8.13	 If you live by your corrupt nature, you are going to die. But if you use your spiritual nature to put to death the evil activities of the body, you will live. 
ROM.8.14	 Certainly, all who are guided by God’s Spirit are God’s children. 
ROM.8.15	 You haven’t received the spirit of slaves that leads you into fear again. Instead, you have received the spirit of God’s adopted children by which we call out, “Abba! 
ROM.8.16	 The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. 
ROM.8.17	 If we are his children, we are also God’s heirs. If we share in Christ’s suffering in order to share his glory, we are heirs together with him.
ROM.8.18	 I consider our present sufferings insignificant compared to the glory that will soon be revealed to us. 
ROM.8.19	 All creation is eagerly waiting for God to reveal who his children are. 
ROM.8.20	 Creation was subjected to frustration but not by its own choice. The one who subjected it to frustration did so in the hope 
ROM.8.21	 that it would also be set free from slavery to decay in order to share the glorious freedom that the children of God will have. 
ROM.8.22	 We know that all creation has been groaning with the pains of childbirth up to the present time.
ROM.8.23	 However, not only creation groans. We, who have the Spirit as the first of God’s gifts, also groan inwardly. We groan as we eagerly wait for our adoption, the freeing of our bodies ⌊from sin⌋. 
ROM.8.24	 We were saved with this hope in mind. If we hope for something we already see, it’s not really hope. Who hopes for what can be seen? 
ROM.8.25	 But if we hope for what we don’t see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.
ROM.8.26	 At the same time the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, because we don’t know how to pray for what we need. But the Spirit intercedes along with our groans that cannot be expressed in words. 
ROM.8.27	 The one who searches our hearts knows what the Spirit has in mind. The Spirit intercedes for God’s people the way God wants him to.
ROM.8.28	 We know that all things work together for the good of those who love God—those whom he has called according to his plan. 
ROM.8.29	 This is true because he already knew his people and had already appointed them to have the same form as the image of his Son. Therefore, his Son is the firstborn among many children. 
ROM.8.30	 He also called those whom he had already appointed. He approved of those whom he had called, and he gave glory to those whom he had approved of.
ROM.8.31	 What can we say about all of this? If God is for us, who can be against us? 
ROM.8.32	 God didn’t spare his own Son but handed him over ⌊to death⌋ for all of us. So he will also give us everything along with him. 
ROM.8.33	 Who will accuse those whom God has chosen? God has approved of them. 
ROM.8.34	 Who will condemn them? Christ has died, and more importantly, he was brought back to life. Christ has the highest position in heaven. Christ also intercedes for us. 
ROM.8.35	 What will separate us from the love Christ has for us? Can trouble, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, or violent death separate us from his love? 
ROM.8.36	 As Scripture says:
ROM.8.36	“We are being killed all day long because of you.
ROM.8.36	We are thought of as sheep to be slaughtered.”
ROM.8.37	 The one who loves us gives us an overwhelming victory in all these difficulties. 
ROM.8.38	 I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love which Christ Jesus our Lord shows us.
ROM.8.39	 or powers in the world above or in the world below, or by anything else in creation.
ROM.9.1	 As a Christian, I’m telling you the truth. I’m not lying. The Holy Spirit, along with my own thoughts, supports me in this. 
ROM.9.2	 I have deep sorrow and endless heartache. 
ROM.9.3	 I wish I could be condemned and cut off from Christ for the sake of others who, like me, are Jewish by birth. 
ROM.9.4	 They are Israelites, God’s adopted children. They have the Lord’s glory, the pledges,
ROM.9.5	 The Messiah is descended from their ancestors according to his human nature. The Messiah is God over everything, forever blessed. Amen.
ROM.9.6	 Now it is not as though God’s word has failed. Clearly, not everyone descended from Israel is part of Israel 
ROM.9.7	 or a descendant of Abraham. However, ⌊as Scripture says,⌋ “Through Isaac your descendants will carry on your name.” 
ROM.9.8	 This means that children born by natural descent ⌊from Abraham⌋ are not necessarily God’s children. Instead, children born by the promise are considered Abraham’s descendants.
ROM.9.9	 For example, this is what the promise said, “I will come back at the right time, and Sarah will have a son.” 
ROM.9.10	 The same thing happened to Rebekah. Rebekah became pregnant by our ancestor Isaac. 
ROM.9.11	 Before the children had been born or had done anything good or bad, Rebekah was told that the older child would serve the younger one. This was said to Rebekah so that God’s plan would remain a matter of his choice, 
ROM.9.12	 a choice based on God’s call and not on anything people do.
ROM.9.13	 The Scriptures say, “I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.”
ROM.9.14	 What can we say—that God is unfair? That’s unthinkable! 
ROM.9.15	 For example, God said to Moses, “I will be kind to anyone I want to. I will be merciful to anyone I want to.” 
ROM.9.16	 Therefore, God’s choice does not depend on a person’s desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.
ROM.9.17	 For example, Scripture says to Pharaoh, “I put you here for this reason: to demonstrate my power through you and to spread my name throughout the earth.” 
ROM.9.18	 Therefore, if God wants to be kind to anyone, he will be. If he wants to make someone stubborn, he will.
ROM.9.19	 You may ask me, “Why does God still find fault with anyone? Who can resist whatever God wants to do?”
ROM.9.20	 Who do you think you are to talk back to God like that? Can an object that was made say to its maker, “Why did you make me like this?” 
ROM.9.21	 A potter has the right to do whatever he wants with his clay. He can make something for a special occasion or something for everyday use from the same lump of clay.
ROM.9.22	 If God wants to demonstrate his anger and reveal his power, he can do it. But can’t he be extremely patient with people who are objects of his anger because they are headed for destruction? 
ROM.9.23	 Can’t God also reveal the riches of his glory to people who are objects of his mercy and who he had already prepared for glory? 
ROM.9.24	 This is what God did for us whom he called—whether we are Jews or not.
ROM.9.25	 As God says in Hosea:
ROM.9.25	“Those who are not my people
ROM.9.25	I will call my people.
ROM.9.25	Those who are not loved
ROM.9.25	I will call my loved ones.
ROM.9.26	 Wherever they were told,
ROM.9.26	‘You are not my people,’
ROM.9.26	they will be called children of the living God.”
ROM.9.27	 Isaiah also says about Israel:
ROM.9.27	“Although the descendants of Israel are
ROM.9.27	as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore,
ROM.9.27	only a few will be saved.
ROM.9.28	 The Lord will carry out his sentence on the land,
ROM.9.28	completely and decisively.”
ROM.9.29	 This is what Isaiah predicted:
ROM.9.29	“If the Lord of Armies hadn’t left us some descendants,
ROM.9.29	we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah.”
ROM.9.30	 So what can we say? We can say that non-Jewish people who were not trying to gain God’s approval won his approval, an approval based on faith. 
ROM.9.31	 The people of Israel tried to gain God’s approval by obeying the laws in Moses’ Teachings, but they did not reach their goal. 
ROM.9.32	 Why? They didn’t rely on faith to gain God’s approval, but they relied on their own efforts. They stumbled over the rock that trips people. 
ROM.9.33	 As Scripture says,
ROM.9.33	“I am placing a rock in Zion that people trip over,
ROM.9.33	a large rock that people find offensive.
ROM.9.33	Whoever believes in him will not be ashamed.”
ROM.10.1	 Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God on behalf of the Jewish people is that they would be saved. 
ROM.10.2	 I can assure you that they are deeply devoted to God, but they are misguided. 
ROM.10.3	 They don’t understand ⌊how to receive⌋ God’s approval. So they try to set up their own way to get it, and they have not accepted God’s way for receiving his approval. 
ROM.10.4	 Christ is the fulfillment of Moses’ Teachings so that everyone who has faith may receive God’s approval.
ROM.10.5	 Moses writes about receiving God’s approval by following his laws. He says, “The person who obeys these laws will live because he obeys them.” 
ROM.10.6	 However, Scripture says about God’s approval which is based on faith, “Don’t ask yourself who will go up to heaven,” (that is, to bring Christ down). 
ROM.10.7	 “Don’t ask who will go down into the depths,” (that is, to bring Christ back from the dead). 
ROM.10.8	 However, what else does it say? “This message is near you. It’s in your mouth and in your heart.” This is the message of faith that we spread. 
ROM.10.9	 If you declare that Jesus is Lord, and believe that God brought him back to life, you will be saved. 
ROM.10.10	 By believing you receive God’s approval, and by declaring your faith you are saved. 
ROM.10.11	 Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be ashamed.”
ROM.10.12	 There is no difference between Jews and Greeks. They all have the same Lord, who gives his riches to everyone who calls on him. 
ROM.10.13	 So then, “Whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
ROM.10.14	 But how can people call on him if they have not believed in him? How can they believe in him if they have not heard his message? How can they hear if no one tells ⌊the Good News⌋? 
ROM.10.15	 How can people tell the Good News if no one sends them? As Scripture says, “How beautiful are the feet of the messengers who announce the Good News.” 
ROM.10.16	 But not everyone has believed the Good News.
ROM.10.16	Isaiah asks, “Lord, who has believed our message?” 
ROM.10.17	 So faith comes from hearing the message, and the message that is heard is what Christ spoke.
ROM.10.18	 But I ask, “Didn’t they hear that message?” Certainly they did! “The voice of the messengers has gone out into the whole world and their words to the ends of the earth.”
ROM.10.19	 Again I ask, “Didn’t Israel understand ⌊that message⌋?” Moses was the first to say, “I will make you jealous of people who are not a nation. I will make you angry about a nation that doesn’t understand.” 
ROM.10.20	 Isaiah said very boldly, “I was found by those who weren’t looking for me. I was revealed to those who weren’t asking for me.” 
ROM.10.21	 Then Isaiah said about Israel, “All day long I have stretched out my hands to disobedient and rebellious people.”
ROM.11.1	 So I ask, “Has God rejected his people Israel?” That’s unthinkable! Consider this. I’m an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin. 
ROM.11.2	 God has not rejected his people whom he knew long ago. Don’t you know what Elijah says in the Scripture passage when he complains to God about Israel? He says, 
ROM.11.3	 “Lord, they’ve killed your prophets and torn down your altars. I’m the only one left, and they’re trying to take my life.” 
ROM.11.4	 But what was God’s reply? God said, “I’ve kept 7,000 people for myself who have not knelt to worship Baal.” 
ROM.11.5	 So, as there were then, there are now a few left that God has chosen by his kindness.
ROM.11.6	 If they were chosen by God’s kindness, they weren’t chosen because of anything they did. Otherwise, God’s kindness wouldn’t be kindness.
ROM.11.7	 So what does all this mean? It means that Israel has never achieved what it has been striving for. However, those whom God has chosen have achieved it. The minds of the rest of Israel were closed, 
ROM.11.8	 as Scripture says,
ROM.11.8	“To this day God has given them a spirit of deep sleep.
ROM.11.8	Their eyes don’t see,
ROM.11.8	and their ears don’t hear!”
ROM.11.9	 And David says,
ROM.11.9	“Let the table set for them become a trap and a net,
ROM.11.9	a snare and a punishment for them.
ROM.11.10	 Let their vision become clouded so that they cannot see.
ROM.11.10	Let them carry back-breaking burdens forever.”
ROM.11.11	 So I ask, “Has Israel stumbled so badly that it can’t get up again?” That’s unthinkable! By Israel’s failure, salvation has come to people who are not Jewish to make the Jewish people jealous. 
ROM.11.12	 The fall of the Jewish people made the world spiritually rich. Their failure made people who are not Jewish spiritually rich. So the inclusion of Jewish people will make the world even richer.
ROM.11.13	 Now, I speak to you who are not Jewish. As long as I am an apostle sent to people who are not Jewish, I bring honor to my ministry. 
ROM.11.14	 Perhaps I can make my people jealous and save some of them. 
ROM.11.15	 If Israel’s rejection means that the world has been brought back to God, what does Israel’s acceptance mean? It means that Israel has come back to life.
ROM.11.16	 If the first handful of dough is holy, the whole batch of dough is holy. If the root is holy, the branches are holy. 
ROM.11.17	 But some of the olive branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive branch, have been grafted in their place. You get your nourishment from the roots of the olive tree. 
ROM.11.18	 So don’t brag about being better than the other branches. If you brag, remember that you don’t support the root, the root supports you. 
ROM.11.19	 “Well,” you say, “Branches were cut off so that I could be grafted onto the tree.” 
ROM.11.20	 That’s right! They were broken off because they didn’t believe, but you remain on the tree because you do believe. Don’t feel arrogant, but be afraid. 
ROM.11.21	 If God didn’t spare the natural branches, he won’t spare you, either. 
ROM.11.22	 Look at how kind and how severe God can be. He is severe to those who fell, but kind to you if you continue to hold on to his kindness. Otherwise, you, too, will be cut off ⌊from the tree⌋.
ROM.11.23	 If Jewish people do not continue in their unbelief, they will be grafted onto the tree again, because God is able to do that. 
ROM.11.24	 In spite of the fact that you have been cut from a wild olive tree, you have been grafted onto a cultivated one. So wouldn’t it be easier for these natural branches to be grafted onto the olive tree they belong to?
ROM.11.25	 Brothers and sisters, I want you to understand this mystery so that you won’t become arrogant. The minds of some Israelites have become closed until all of God’s non-Jewish people are included. 
ROM.11.26	 In this way Israel as a whole will be saved, as Scripture says,
ROM.11.26	“The Savior will come from Zion.
ROM.11.26	He will remove godlessness from Jacob.
ROM.11.27	 My promise 
ROM.11.27	when I take away their sins.”
ROM.11.28	 The Good News made the Jewish people enemies because of you. But by God’s choice they are loved because of their ancestors. 
ROM.11.29	 God never changes his mind when he gives gifts or when he calls someone. 
ROM.11.30	 In the past, you disobeyed God. But now God has been merciful to you because of the disobedience of the Jewish people. 
ROM.11.31	 In the same way, the Jewish people have also disobeyed so that God may be merciful to them as he was to you. 
ROM.11.32	 God has placed all people into the prison of their own disobedience so that he could be merciful to all people.
ROM.11.33	 God’s riches, wisdom, and knowledge are so deep
ROM.11.33	that it is impossible to explain his decisions
ROM.11.33	or to understand his ways.
ROM.11.34	 “Who knows how the Lord thinks?
ROM.11.34	Who can become his adviser?”
ROM.11.35	 Who gave the Lord something
ROM.11.35	which the Lord must pay back?
ROM.11.36	 Everything is from him and by him and for him.
ROM.11.36	Glory belongs to him forever! Amen!
ROM.12.1	 Brothers and sisters, in view of all we have just shared about God’s compassion, I encourage you to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, dedicated to God and pleasing to him. This kind of worship is appropriate for you. 
ROM.12.2	 Don’t become like the people of this world. Instead, change the way you think. Then you will always be able to determine what God really wants—what is good, pleasing, and perfect.
ROM.12.3	 Because of the kindness 
ROM.12.4	 Our bodies have many parts, but these parts don’t all do the same thing. 
ROM.12.5	 In the same way, even though we are many individuals, Christ makes us one body and individuals who are connected to each other. 
ROM.12.6	 God in his kindness gave each of us different gifts. If your gift is speaking what God has revealed, make sure what you say agrees with the Christian faith. 
ROM.12.7	 If your gift is serving, then devote yourself to serving. If it is teaching, devote yourself to teaching. 
ROM.12.8	 If it is encouraging others, devote yourself to giving encouragement. If it is sharing, be generous. If it is leadership, lead enthusiastically. If it is helping people in need, help them cheerfully.
ROM.12.9	 Love sincerely. Hate evil. Hold on to what is good. 
ROM.12.10	 Be devoted to each other like a loving family. Excel in showing respect for each other. 
ROM.12.11	 Don’t be lazy in showing your devotion. Use your energy to serve the Lord. 
ROM.12.12	 Be happy in your confidence, be patient in trouble, and pray continually. 
ROM.12.13	 Share what you have with God’s people who are in need. Be hospitable.
ROM.12.14	 Bless those who persecute you. Bless them, and don’t curse them. 
ROM.12.15	 Be happy with those who are happy. Be sad with those who are sad. 
ROM.12.16	 Live in harmony with each other. Don’t be arrogant, but be friendly to humble people. Don’t think that you are smarter than you really are.
ROM.12.17	 Don’t pay people back with evil for the evil they do to you. Focus your thoughts on those things that are considered noble. 
ROM.12.18	 As much as it is possible, live in peace with everyone. 
ROM.12.19	 Don’t take revenge, dear friends. Instead, let God’s anger take care of it. After all, Scripture says, “I alone have the right to take revenge. I will pay back, says the Lord.” 
ROM.12.20	 But,
ROM.12.20	“If your enemy is hungry, feed him.
ROM.12.20	If he is thirsty, give him a drink.
ROM.12.20	If you do this, you will make him feel guilty and ashamed.”
ROM.12.21	 Don’t let evil conquer you, but conquer evil with good.
ROM.13.1	 Every person should obey the government in power. No government would exist if it hadn’t been established by God. The governments which exist have been put in place by God. 
ROM.13.2	 Therefore, whoever resists the government opposes what God has established. Those who resist will bring punishment on themselves.
ROM.13.3	 People who do what is right don’t have to be afraid of the government. But people who do what is wrong should be afraid of it. Would you like to live without being afraid of the government? Do what is right, and it will praise you. 
ROM.13.4	 The government is God’s servant working for your good.
ROM.13.4	But if you do what is wrong, you should be afraid. The government has the right to carry out the death sentence. It is God’s servant, an avenger to execute God’s anger on anyone who does what is wrong. 
ROM.13.5	 Therefore, it is necessary for you to obey, not only because you’re afraid of God’s anger but also because of your own conscience.
ROM.13.6	 That is also why you pay your taxes. People in the government are God’s servants while they do the work he has given them. 
ROM.13.7	 Pay everyone whatever you owe them. If you owe taxes, pay them. If you owe tolls, pay them. If you owe someone respect, respect that person. If you owe someone honor, honor that person.
ROM.13.8	 Pay your debts as they come due. However, one debt you can never finish paying is the debt of love that you owe each other. The one who loves another person has fulfilled Moses’ Teachings. 
ROM.13.9	 The commandments, “Never commit adultery; never murder; never steal; never have wrong desires,” and every other commandment are summed up in this statement: “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” 
ROM.13.10	 Love never does anything that is harmful to a neighbor. Therefore, love fulfills Moses’ Teachings.
ROM.13.11	 You know the times ⌊in which we are living⌋. It’s time for you to wake up. Our salvation is nearer now than when we first became believers. 
ROM.13.12	 The night is almost over, and the day is near. So we should get rid of the things that belong to the dark and take up the weapons that belong to the light. 
ROM.13.13	 We should live decently, as people who live in the light of day. Wild parties, drunkenness, sexual immorality, promiscuity, rivalry, and jealousy cannot be part of our lives. 
ROM.13.14	 Instead, live like the Lord Jesus Christ did, and forget about satisfying the desires of your corrupt nature.
ROM.14.1	 Welcome people who are weak in faith, but don’t get into an argument over differences of opinion. 
ROM.14.2	 Some people believe that they can eat all kinds of food. Other people with weak faith believe that they can eat only vegetables. 
ROM.14.3	 People who eat all foods should not despise people who eat only vegetables. In the same way, the vegetarians should not criticize people who eat all foods, because God has accepted those people. 
ROM.14.4	 Who are you to criticize someone else’s servant? The Lord will determine whether his servant has been successful. The servant will be successful because the Lord makes him successful.
ROM.14.5	 One person decides that one day is holier than another. Another person decides that all days are the same. Every person must make his own decision. 
ROM.14.6	 When people observe a special day, they observe it to honor the Lord. When people eat all kinds of foods, they honor the Lord as they eat, since they give thanks to God. Vegetarians also honor the Lord when they eat, and they, too, give thanks to God. 
ROM.14.7	 It’s clear that we don’t live to honor ourselves, and we don’t die to honor ourselves. 
ROM.14.8	 If we live, we honor the Lord, and if we die, we honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. 
ROM.14.9	 For this reason Christ died and came back to life so that he would be the Lord of both the living and the dead.
ROM.14.10	 Why do you criticize or despise other Christians? Everyone will stand in front of God to be judged. 
ROM.14.11	 Scripture says,
ROM.14.11	“As certainly as I live, says the Lord,
ROM.14.11	everyone will worship me,
ROM.14.11	and everyone will praise God.”
ROM.14.12	 All of us will have to give an account of ourselves to God.
ROM.14.13	 So let’s stop criticizing each other. Instead, you should decide never to do anything that would make other Christians have doubts or lose their faith.
ROM.14.14	 The Lord Jesus has given me the knowledge and conviction that no food is unacceptable in and of itself. But it is unacceptable to a person who thinks it is. 
ROM.14.15	 So if what you eat hurts another Christian, you are no longer living by love. Don’t destroy anyone by what you eat. Christ died for that person. 
ROM.14.16	 Don’t allow anyone to say that what you consider good is evil.
ROM.14.17	 God’s kingdom does not consist of what a person eats or drinks. Rather, God’s kingdom consists of God’s approval and peace, as well as the joy that the Holy Spirit gives. 
ROM.14.18	 The person who serves Christ with this in mind is pleasing to God and respected by people.
ROM.14.19	 So let’s pursue those things which bring peace and which are good for each other. 
ROM.14.20	 Don’t ruin God’s work because of what you eat. All food is acceptable, but it’s wrong for a person to eat something if it causes someone else to have doubts. 
ROM.14.21	 The right thing to do is to avoid eating meat, drinking wine, or doing anything else that causes another Christian to have doubts. 
ROM.14.22	 So whatever you believe about these things, keep it between yourself and God. The person who does what he knows is right shouldn’t feel guilty. He is blessed. 
ROM.14.23	 But if a person has doubts and still eats, he is condemned because he didn’t act in faith. Anything that is not done in faith is sin.
ROM.15.1	 So those of us who have a strong ⌊faith⌋ must be patient with the weaknesses of those whose ⌊faith⌋ is not so strong. We must not think only of ourselves. 
ROM.15.2	 We should all be concerned about our neighbor and the good things that will build his faith. 
ROM.15.3	 Christ did not think only of himself. Rather, as Scripture says, “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”
ROM.15.4	 Everything written long ago was written to teach us so that we would have confidence through the endurance and encouragement which the Scriptures give us. 
ROM.15.5	 May God, who gives you this endurance and encouragement, allow you to live in harmony with each other by following the example of Christ Jesus. 
ROM.15.6	 Then, having the same goal, you will praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.15.7	 Therefore, accept each other in the same way that Christ accepted you. He did this to bring glory to God. 
ROM.15.8	 Let me explain. Christ became a servant for the Jewish people to reveal God’s truth. As a result, he fulfilled God’s promise to the ancestors of the Jewish people. 
ROM.15.9	 People who are not Jewish praise God for his mercy as well. This is what the Scriptures say,
ROM.15.9	“That is why I will give thanks to you among the nations
ROM.15.9	and I will sing praises to your name.”
ROM.15.10	 And Scripture says again,
ROM.15.10	“You nations, be happy together with his people!”
ROM.15.11	 And again,
ROM.15.11	“Praise the Lord, all you nations!
ROM.15.11	Praise him, all you people of the world!”
ROM.15.12	 Again, Isaiah says,
ROM.15.12	“There will be a root from Jesse.
ROM.15.12	He will rise to rule the nations,
ROM.15.12	and he will give the nations hope.”
ROM.15.13	 May God, the source of hope, fill you with joy and peace through your faith in him. Then you will overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
ROM.15.14	 I’m convinced, brothers and sisters, that you, too, are filled with goodness. I’m also convinced that you have all the knowledge you need and that you are able to instruct each other. 
ROM.15.15	 However, I’ve written you a letter, parts of which are rather bold, as a reminder to you. I’m doing this because God gave me the gift 
ROM.15.16	 to be a servant of Christ Jesus to people who are not Jewish. I serve as a priest by spreading the Good News of God. I do this in order that I might bring the nations to God as an acceptable offering, made holy by the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.15.17	 So Christ Jesus gives me the right to brag about what I’m doing for God. 
ROM.15.18	 I’m bold enough to tell you only what Christ has done through me to bring people who are not Jewish to obedience. By what I have said and done, 
ROM.15.19	 by the power of miraculous and amazing signs, and by the power of God’s Spirit, I have finished spreading the Good News about Christ from Jerusalem to Illyricum.
ROM.15.20	 My goal was to spread the Good News where the name of Christ was not known. I didn’t want to build on a foundation which others had laid. 
ROM.15.21	 As Scripture says,
ROM.15.21	“Those who were never told about him will see,
ROM.15.21	and those who never heard will understand.”
ROM.15.22	 This is what has so often kept me from visiting you. 
ROM.15.23	 But now I have no new opportunities for work in this region. For many years I have wanted to visit you. 
ROM.15.24	 Now I am on my way to Spain, so I hope to see you when I come your way. After I have enjoyed your company for a while, I hope that you will support my trip to Spain.
ROM.15.25	 Right now I’m going to Jerusalem to bring help to the Christians there. 
ROM.15.26	 Because the believers in Macedonia and Greece owe a debt to the Christians in Jerusalem, they have decided to take up a collection for the poor among the Christians in Jerusalem. 
ROM.15.27	 These Macedonians and Greeks have shared the spiritual wealth of the Christians in Jerusalem. So they are obligated to use their earthly wealth to help them.
ROM.15.28	 When the collection is completed and I have officially turned the money over to the Christians in Jerusalem, I will visit you on my way to Spain. 
ROM.15.29	 I know that when I come to you I will bring the full blessing of Christ.
ROM.15.30	 Brothers and sisters, I encourage you through our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love that the Spirit creates, to join me in my struggle. Pray to God for me 
ROM.15.31	 that I will be rescued from those people in Judea who refuse to believe. Pray that God’s people in Jerusalem will accept the help I bring. 
ROM.15.32	 Also pray that by the will of God I may come to you with joy and be refreshed when I am with you.
ROM.15.33	 May the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.1	 With this letter I’m introducing Phoebe to you. She is our sister in the Christian faith and a deacon 
ROM.16.2	 Give her a Christian welcome that shows you are God’s holy people. Provide her with anything she may need, because she has provided help to many people, including me.
ROM.16.3	 Greet Prisca and Aquila, my coworkers in the service of Christ Jesus. 
ROM.16.4	 They risked their lives to save me. I’m thankful to them and so are all the churches among the nations. 
ROM.16.5	 Also greet the church that meets in their house.
ROM.16.5	Greet my dear friend Epaenetus. He was the first person in the province of Asia to become a believer in Christ.
ROM.16.6	 Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you.
ROM.16.7	 Greet Andronicus and Junia, who are Jewish by birth like me. They are prisoners like me and are prominent among the apostles. They also were Christians before I was.
ROM.16.8	 Greet Ampliatus my dear friend in the service of the Lord.
ROM.16.9	 Greet Urbanus our coworker in the service of Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
ROM.16.10	 Greet Apelles, a true Christian.
ROM.16.10	Greet those who belong to the family of Aristobulus.
ROM.16.11	 Greet Herodion, who is Jewish by birth like me.
ROM.16.11	Greet those Christians who belong to the family of Narcissus.
ROM.16.12	 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard for the Lord.
ROM.16.12	Greet dear Persis, who has worked very hard for the Lord.
ROM.16.13	 Greet Rufus, that outstanding Christian, and his mother, who has been a mother to me too.
ROM.16.14	 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters who are with them.
ROM.16.15	 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all God’s people who are with them.
ROM.16.16	 Greet each other with a holy kiss.
ROM.16.16	All the churches of Christ greet you.
ROM.16.17	 Brothers and sisters, I urge you to watch out for those people who create divisions and who make others fall away ⌊from the Christian faith⌋ by teaching doctrine that is not the same as you have learned. Stay away from them. 
ROM.16.18	 People like these are not serving Christ our Lord. They are serving their own desires. By their smooth talk and flattering words they deceive unsuspecting people.
ROM.16.19	 Everyone has heard about your obedience and this makes me happy for you. I want you to do what is good and to avoid what is evil. 
ROM.16.20	 The God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. May the good will 
ROM.16.21	 Timothy my coworker greets you; so do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, who are Jewish by birth like me.
ROM.16.22	 I, Tertius, who wrote this letter, send you Christian greetings.
ROM.16.23	 Gaius greets you. He is host to me and the whole church.
ROM.16.23	Erastus, the city treasurer, greets you.
ROM.16.23	Quartus, our brother in the Christian faith, greets you.
ROM.16.25	 God can strengthen you by the Good News and the message I tell about Jesus Christ. He can strengthen you by revealing the mystery that was kept in silence for a very long time 
ROM.16.26	 but now is publicly known. The everlasting God ordered that what the prophets wrote must be shown to the people of every nation to bring them to the obedience that is associated with faith. 
ROM.16.27	 God alone is wise. Glory belongs to him through Jesus Christ forever! Amen.
1CO.1.1	 From Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our brother in the Christian faith.
1CO.1.2	 To God’s church that was made holy by Christ Jesus and called to be God’s holy people in the city of Corinth and to people everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.1.3	 Good will 
1CO.1.4	 I always thank God for you because Christ Jesus has shown you God’s good will. 
1CO.1.5	 Through Christ Jesus you have become rich in every way—in speech and knowledge of every kind. 
1CO.1.6	 Our message about Christ has been verified among you. 
1CO.1.7	 Therefore, you don’t lack any gift as you wait eagerly for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. 
1CO.1.8	 He will continue to give you strength until the end so that no one can accuse you of anything on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1CO.1.9	 God faithfully keeps his promises. He called you to be partners with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
1CO.1.10	 Brothers and sisters, I encourage all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to agree with each other and not to split into opposing groups. I want you to be united in your understanding and opinions. 
1CO.1.11	 Brothers and sisters, some people from Chloe’s family have made it clear to me that you are quarreling among yourselves. 
1CO.1.12	 This is what I mean: Each of you is saying, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” 
1CO.1.13	 Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in Paul’s name? 
1CO.1.14	 I thank God that 
1CO.1.15	 so that no one can say you were baptized in my name. 
1CO.1.16	 I also baptized Stephanas and his family. Beyond that, I’m not sure whether I baptized anyone else. 
1CO.1.17	 Christ didn’t send me to baptize. Instead, he sent me to spread the Good News. I didn’t use intellectual arguments. That would have made the cross of Christ lose its meaning.
1CO.1.18	 The message about the cross is nonsense to those who are being destroyed, but it is God’s power to us who are being saved. 
1CO.1.19	 Scripture says,
1CO.1.19	“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise.
1CO.1.19	I will reject the intelligence of intelligent people.”
1CO.1.20	 Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the persuasive speaker of our time? Hasn’t God turned the wisdom of the world into nonsense? 
1CO.1.21	 The world with its wisdom was unable to recognize God in terms of his own wisdom. So God decided to use the nonsense of the Good News we speak to save those who believe. 
1CO.1.22	 Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks look for wisdom, 
1CO.1.23	 but our message is that Christ was crucified. This offends Jewish people and makes no sense to people who are not Jewish. 
1CO.1.24	 But to those Jews and Greeks who are called, he is Christ, God’s power and God’s wisdom. 
1CO.1.25	 God’s nonsense is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.
1CO.1.26	 Brothers and sisters, consider what you were when God called you to be Christians. Not many of you were wise from a human point of view. You were not in powerful positions or in the upper social classes. 
1CO.1.27	 But God chose what the world considers nonsense to put wise people to shame. God chose what the world considers weak to put what is strong to shame. 
1CO.1.28	 God chose what the world considers ordinary and what it despises—what it considers to be nothing—in order to destroy what it considers to be something. 
1CO.1.29	 As a result, no one can brag in God’s presence. 
1CO.1.30	 You are partners with Christ Jesus because of God. Jesus has become our wisdom sent from God, our approval, our holiness, and our ransom from sin. 
1CO.1.31	 As Scripture says, “Whoever brags must brag about what the Lord has done.”
1CO.2.1	 Brothers and sisters, when I came to you, I didn’t speak about God’s mystery 
1CO.2.2	 While I was with you, I decided to deal with only one subject—Jesus Christ, who was crucified. 
1CO.2.3	 When I came to you, I was weak. I was afraid and very nervous. 
1CO.2.4	 I didn’t speak my message with persuasive intellectual arguments. I spoke my message with a show of spiritual power 
1CO.2.5	 so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on God’s power.
1CO.2.6	 However, we do use wisdom to speak to those who are mature. It is a wisdom that doesn’t belong to this world or to the rulers of this world who are in power today and gone tomorrow. 
1CO.2.7	 We speak about the mystery of God’s wisdom. It is a wisdom that has been hidden, which God had planned for our glory before the world began. 
1CO.2.8	 Not one of the rulers of this world has known it. If they had, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory. 
1CO.2.9	 But as Scripture says:
1CO.2.9	“No eye has seen,
1CO.2.9	no ear has heard,
1CO.2.9	and no mind has imagined
1CO.2.9	the things that God has prepared
1CO.2.9	for those who love him.”
1CO.2.10	 God has revealed those things to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches everything, especially the deep things of God. 
1CO.2.11	 After all, who knows everything about a person except that person’s own spirit? In the same way, no one has known everything about God except God’s Spirit. 
1CO.2.12	 Now, we didn’t receive the spirit that belongs to the world. Instead, we received the Spirit who comes from God so that we could know the things which God has freely given us. 
1CO.2.13	 We don’t speak about these things using teachings that are based on intellectual arguments like people do. Instead, we use the Spirit’s teachings. We explain spiritual things to those who have the Spirit.
1CO.2.14	 A person who isn’t spiritual doesn’t accept the teachings of God’s Spirit. He thinks they’re nonsense. He can’t understand them because a person must be spiritual to evaluate them. 
1CO.2.15	 Spiritual people evaluate everything but are subject to no one’s evaluation.
1CO.2.16	 “Who has known the mind of the Lord
1CO.2.16	so that he can teach him?”
1CO.2.16	However, we have the mind of Christ.
1CO.3.1	 Brothers and sisters, I couldn’t talk to you as spiritual people but as people still influenced by your corrupt nature. You were infants in your faith in Christ. 
1CO.3.2	 I gave you milk to drink. I didn’t give you solid food because you weren’t ready for it. Even now you aren’t ready for it 
1CO.3.3	 because you’re still influenced by your corrupt nature.
1CO.3.3	When you are jealous and quarrel among yourselves, aren’t you influenced by your corrupt nature and living by human standards? 
1CO.3.4	 When some of you say, “I follow Paul” and others say, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you acting like ⌊sinful⌋ humans? 
1CO.3.5	 Who is Apollos? Who is Paul? They are servants who helped you come to faith. Each did what the Lord gave him to do. 
1CO.3.6	 I planted, and Apollos watered, but God made it grow. 
1CO.3.7	 So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is important because ⌊only⌋ God makes it grow. 
1CO.3.8	 The one who plants and the one who waters have the same goal, and each will receive a reward for his own work. 
1CO.3.9	 We are God’s coworkers. You are God’s field.
1CO.3.9	You are God’s building. 
1CO.3.10	 As a skilled and experienced builder, I used the gift 
1CO.3.11	 After all, no one can lay any other foundation than the one that is already laid, and that foundation is Jesus Christ. 
1CO.3.12	 People may build on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw. 
1CO.3.13	 The day will make what each one does clearly visible because fire will reveal it. That fire will determine what kind of work each person has done. 
1CO.3.14	 If what a person has built survives, he will receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	 If his work is burned up, he will suffer ⌊the loss⌋. However, he will be saved, though it will be like going through a fire.
1CO.3.16	 Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you? 
1CO.3.17	 If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him because God’s temple is holy. You are that holy temple!
1CO.3.18	 Don’t deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise in the ways of this world, you should give up that wisdom in order to become really wise. 
1CO.3.19	 The wisdom of this world is nonsense in God’s sight. That’s why Scripture says, “God catches the wise in their cleverness.” 
1CO.3.20	 Again Scripture says, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are pointless.”
1CO.3.21	 So don’t brag about people. Everything belongs to you. 
1CO.3.22	 Whether it is Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life or death, present or future things, everything belongs to you. 
1CO.3.23	 You belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
1CO.4.1	 People should think of us as servants of Christ and managers who are entrusted with God’s mysteries. 
1CO.4.2	 Managers are required to be trustworthy.
1CO.4.3	 It means very little to me that you or any human court should cross-examine me. I don’t even ask myself questions. 
1CO.4.4	 I have a clear conscience, but that doesn’t mean I have God’s approval. It is the Lord who cross-examines me. 
1CO.4.5	 Therefore, don’t judge anything before the appointed time. Wait until the Lord comes. He will also bring to light what is hidden in the dark and reveal people’s motives. Then each person will receive praise from God.
1CO.4.6	 Brothers and sisters, I have applied this to Apollos and myself for your sake. You should learn from us not to go beyond what is written in Scripture. Then you won’t arrogantly place one of us in opposition to the other.
1CO.4.7	 Who says that you are any better than other people? What do you have that wasn’t given to you? If you were given what you have, why are you bragging as if it weren’t a gift?
1CO.4.8	 You already have what you want! You’ve already become rich! You’ve become kings without us! I wish you really were kings so that we could be kings with you.
1CO.4.9	 As I see it, God has placed us apostles last in line, like people condemned to die. We have become a spectacle for people and angels to look at. 
1CO.4.10	 We have given up our wisdom for Christ, but you have insight because of Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored. 
1CO.4.11	 To this moment, we are hungry, thirsty, poorly dressed, roughly treated, and homeless. 
1CO.4.12	 We wear ourselves out doing physical labor. When people verbally abuse us, we bless them. When people persecute us, we endure it. 
1CO.4.13	 When our reputations are attacked, we remain courteous. Right now we have become garbage in the eyes of the world and trash in the sight of all people.
1CO.4.14	 I’m not writing this to make you feel ashamed but to instruct you as my dear children. 
1CO.4.15	 You may have countless Christian guardians, but you don’t have many ⌊spiritual⌋ fathers. I became your father in the Christian life by telling you the Good News about Christ Jesus. 
1CO.4.16	 So I encourage you to imitate me. 
1CO.4.17	 That’s why I’ve sent Timothy to you to help you remember my Christian way of life as I teach it everywhere in every church. Timothy is my dear child, and he faithfully does the Lord’s work.
1CO.4.18	 Some of you have become arrogant because you think I won’t pay you a visit. 
1CO.4.19	 If it’s the Lord’s will, I’ll visit you soon. Then I’ll know what these arrogant people are saying and what power they have. 
1CO.4.20	 God’s kingdom is not just talk, it is power.
1CO.4.21	 When I come to visit you, would you prefer that I punish you or show you love and a gentle spirit?
1CO.5.1	 Your own members are aware that there is sexual sin going on among them. This kind of sin is not even heard of among unbelievers—a man is actually married to his father’s wife. 
1CO.5.2	 You’re being arrogant when you should have been more upset about this. If you had been upset, the man who did this would have been removed from among you. 
1CO.5.3	 Although I’m not physically present with you, I am with you in spirit. I have already judged the man who did this as though I were present with you. 
1CO.5.4	 When you have gathered together, I am with you in spirit. Then, in the name of our Lord Jesus, and with his power, 
1CO.5.5	 hand such a person over to Satan to destroy his corrupt nature so that his spiritual nature may be saved on the day of the Lord.
1CO.5.6	 It’s not good for you to brag. Don’t you know that a little yeast spreads through the whole batch of dough? 
1CO.5.7	 Remove the old yeast ⌊of sin⌋ so that you may be a new batch of dough, since you don’t actually have the yeast ⌊of sin⌋.
1CO.5.7	Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
1CO.5.8	 So we must not celebrate our festival with the old yeast ⌊of sin⌋ or with the yeast of vice and wickedness. Instead, we must celebrate it with the bread of purity and truth that has no yeast.
1CO.5.9	 In my letter to you I told you not to associate with people who continue to commit sexual sins. 
1CO.5.10	 I didn’t tell you that you could not have any contact with unbelievers who commit sexual sins, are greedy, are dishonest, or worship false gods. If that were the case, you would have to leave this world. 
1CO.5.11	 Now, what I meant was that you should not associate with people who call themselves brothers or sisters in the Christian faith but live in sexual sin, are greedy, worship false gods, use abusive language, get drunk, or are dishonest. Don’t eat with such people.
1CO.5.12	 After all, do I have any business judging those who are outside ⌊the Christian faith⌋? Isn’t it your business to judge those who are inside? 
1CO.5.13	 God will judge those who are outside. Remove that wicked man from among you.
1CO.6.1	 When one of you has a complaint against another, how dare you go to court to settle the matter in front of wicked people. Why don’t you settle it in front of God’s holy people? 
1CO.6.2	 Don’t you know that God’s people will judge the world? So if you’re going to judge the world, aren’t you capable of judging insignificant cases? 
1CO.6.3	 Don’t you know that we will judge angels, not to mention things in this life? 
1CO.6.4	 When you have cases dealing with this life, why do you allow people whom the church has a low opinion of to be your judges? 
1CO.6.5	 You should be ashamed of yourselves! Don’t you have at least one wise person who is able to settle disagreements between believers? 
1CO.6.6	 Instead, one believer goes to court against another believer, and this happens in front of unbelievers.
1CO.6.7	 You are already totally defeated because you have lawsuits against each other. Why don’t you accept the fact that you have been wronged? Why don’t you accept that you have been cheated? 
1CO.6.8	 Instead, you do wrong and cheat, and you do this to other believers.
1CO.6.9	 Don’t you know that wicked people won’t inherit the kingdom of God? Stop deceiving yourselves! People who continue to commit sexual sins, who worship false gods, those who commit adultery, homosexuals, 
1CO.6.10	 or thieves, those who are greedy or drunk, who use abusive language, or who rob people will not inherit the kingdom of God. 
1CO.6.11	 That’s what some of you were! But you have been washed and made holy, and you have received God’s approval in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.12	 Someone may say, “I’m allowed to do anything,” but not everything is helpful. I’m allowed to do anything, but I won’t allow anything to gain control over my life. 
1CO.6.13	 Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food, but God will put an end to both of them. However, the body is not for sexual sin but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. 
1CO.6.14	 God brought the Lord back to life, and by his power God will also bring us back to life.
1CO.6.15	 Don’t you realize that your bodies are parts of Christ’s body? Should I take the parts of Christ’s body and make them parts of a prostitute’s body? That’s unthinkable! 
1CO.6.16	 Don’t you realize that the person who unites himself with a prostitute becomes one body with her? God says, “The two will be one.” 
1CO.6.17	 However, the person who unites himself with the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
1CO.6.18	 Stay away from sexual sins. Other sins that people commit don’t affect their bodies the same way sexual sins do. People who sin sexually sin against their own bodies. 
1CO.6.19	 Don’t you know that your body is a temple that belongs to the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit, whom you received from God, lives in you. You don’t belong to yourselves. 
1CO.6.20	 You were bought for a price. So bring glory to God in the way you use your body.
1CO.7.1	 Now, concerning the things that you wrote about: It’s good for men not to get married. 
1CO.7.2	 But in order to avoid sexual sins, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.
1CO.7.3	 Husbands and wives should satisfy each other’s ⌊sexual⌋ needs. 
1CO.7.4	 A wife doesn’t have authority over her own body, but her husband does. In the same way, a husband doesn’t have authority over his own body, but his wife does.
1CO.7.5	 Don’t withhold yourselves from each other unless you agree to do so for a set time to devote yourselves to prayer. Then you should get back together so that Satan doesn’t use your lack of self-control to tempt you. 
1CO.7.6	 What I have just said is not meant as a command but as a suggestion. 
1CO.7.7	 I would like everyone to be like me. However, each person has a special gift from God, and these gifts vary from person to person.
1CO.7.8	 I say to those who are not married, especially to widows: It is good for you to stay single like me. 
1CO.7.9	 However, if you cannot control your desires, you should get married. It is better for you to marry than to burn ⌊with sexual desire⌋.
1CO.7.10	 I pass this command along (not really I, but the Lord): A wife shouldn’t leave her husband. 
1CO.7.11	 If she does, she should stay single or make up with her husband. Likewise, a husband should not divorce his wife.
1CO.7.12	 I (not the Lord) say to the rest of you: If any Christian man is married to a woman who is an unbeliever, and she is willing to live with him, he should not divorce her. 
1CO.7.13	 If any Christian woman is married to a man who is an unbeliever, and he is willing to live with her, she should not divorce her husband. 
1CO.7.14	 Actually, the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and an unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise, their children would be unacceptable ⌊to God⌋, but now they are acceptable to him. 
1CO.7.15	 But if the unbelieving partners leave, let them go. Under these circumstances a Christian man or Christian woman is not bound ⌊by a marriage vow⌋. God has called you to live in peace. 
1CO.7.16	 How do you as a wife know whether you will save your husband? How do you as a husband know whether you will save your wife?
1CO.7.17	 Everyone should live the life that the Lord gave him when God called him. This is the guideline I use in every church.
1CO.7.18	 Any man who was already circumcised when he was called to be a Christian shouldn’t undo his circumcision. Any man who was uncircumcised when he was called to be a Christian shouldn’t get circumcised. 
1CO.7.19	 Circumcision is nothing, and the lack of it is nothing. But keeping what God commands is everything. 
1CO.7.20	 All people should stay as they were when they were called. 
1CO.7.21	 Were you a slave when you were called? That shouldn’t bother you. However, if you have a chance to become free, take it. 
1CO.7.22	 If the Lord called you when you were a slave, you are the Lord’s free person. In the same way, if you were free when you were called, you are Christ’s slave. 
1CO.7.23	 You were bought for a price. Don’t become anyone’s slaves. 
1CO.7.24	 Brothers and sisters, you should remain in whatever circumstances you were in when God called you. God is with you in those circumstances.
1CO.7.25	 Concerning virgins: Even though I don’t have any command from the Lord, I’ll give you my opinion. I’m a person to whom the Lord has shown mercy, so I can be trusted. 
1CO.7.26	 Because of the present crisis I believe it is good for people to remain as they are. 
1CO.7.27	 Do you have a wife? Don’t seek a divorce. Are you divorced from your wife? Don’t look for another one. 
1CO.7.28	 But if you do get married, you have not sinned. If a virgin gets married, she has not sinned. However, these people will have trouble, and I would like to spare them from that.
1CO.7.29	 This is what I mean, brothers and sisters: The time has been shortened. While it lasts, those who are married should live as though they were not. 
1CO.7.30	 Those who have eyes filled with tears should live as though they have no sorrow. Those who are happy should live as though there was nothing to be happy about. Those who buy something should live as though they didn’t own it. 
1CO.7.31	 Those who use the things in this world should do so but not depend on them. It is clear that this world in its present form is passing away.
1CO.7.32	 So I don’t want you to have any concerns. An unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, ⌊that is,⌋ about how he can please the Lord. 
1CO.7.33	 But the married man is concerned about earthly things, ⌊that is,⌋ about how he can please his wife. 
1CO.7.34	 His attention is divided.
1CO.7.34	An unmarried woman or a virgin is concerned about the Lord’s things so that she may be holy in body and in spirit. But the married woman is concerned about earthly things, ⌊that is,⌋ about how she can please her husband. 
1CO.7.35	 I’m saying this for your benefit, not to restrict you. I’m showing you how to live a noble life of devotion to the Lord without being distracted by other things.
1CO.7.36	 No father would want to do the wrong thing when his virgin daughter is old enough to get married. If she wants to get married, he isn’t sinning by letting her get married. 
1CO.7.37	 However, a father may have come to a decision about his daughter. If his decision is to keep her ⌊at home⌋ because she doesn’t want to get married, that’s fine. 
1CO.7.38	 So it’s fine for a father to give his daughter in marriage, but the father who doesn’t give his daughter in marriage does even better.
1CO.7.39	 A married woman must remain with her husband as long as he lives. If her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but only if the man is a Christian.
1CO.7.40	 However, she will be more blessed if she stays as she is. That is my opinion, and I think that I, too, have God’s Spirit.
1CO.8.1	 Now, concerning food offered to false gods: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes people arrogant, but love builds them up. 
1CO.8.2	 Those who think they know something still have a lot to learn. 
1CO.8.3	 But if they love God, they are known by God.
1CO.8.4	 Now about eating food that was offered to false gods: We know that the false gods in this world don’t really exist and that no god exists except the one God. 
1CO.8.5	 People may say that there are gods in heaven and on earth—many gods and many lords, as they would call them. 
1CO.8.6	 But for us,
1CO.8.6	“There is only one God, the Father.
1CO.8.6	Everything came from him, and we live for him.
1CO.8.6	There is only one Lord, Jesus Christ.
1CO.8.6	Everything came into being through him,
1CO.8.6	and we live because of him.”
1CO.8.7	 But not everyone knows this. Some people are so used to worshiping false gods that they believe they are eating food offered to a false god. So they feel guilty because their conscience is weak.
1CO.8.8	 Food will not affect our relationship with God. We are no worse off if we eat ⌊that food⌋ and no better off if we don’t. 
1CO.8.9	 But be careful that by using your freedom you don’t somehow make a believer who is weak in faith fall into sin. 
1CO.8.10	 For example, suppose someone with a weak conscience sees you, who have this knowledge, eating in the temple of a false god. Won’t you be encouraging that person to eat food offered to a false god? 
1CO.8.11	 In that case, your knowledge is ruining a believer whose faith is weak, a believer for whom Christ died. 
1CO.8.12	 When you sin against other believers in this way and harm their weak consciences, you are sinning against Christ.
1CO.8.13	 Therefore, if eating food ⌊offered to false gods⌋ causes other believers to lose their faith, I will never eat that kind of food so that I won’t make other believers lose their faith.
1CO.9.1	 Don’t you agree that I’m a free man? Don’t you agree that I’m an apostle? Haven’t I seen Jesus our Lord? Aren’t you the result of my work for the Lord? 
1CO.9.2	 If I’m not an apostle to other people, at least I’m an apostle to you. You are the seal which proves that I am the Lord’s apostle. 
1CO.9.3	 This is how I defend myself to those who cross-examine me. 
1CO.9.4	 Don’t we have the right to eat and drink? 
1CO.9.5	 Don’t we have the right to take our wives along with us like the other apostles, the Lord’s brothers, and Cephas 
1CO.9.6	 Or is it only Barnabas and I who don’t have any rights, except to find work to support ourselves?
1CO.9.7	 Does a soldier ever serve in the army at his own expense? Does anyone plant a vineyard and not eat the grapes? Does anyone take care of a flock and not drink milk from the sheep? 
1CO.9.8	 Am I merely stating some human rule? Don’t Moses’ Teachings say the same thing? 
1CO.9.9	 Moses’ Teachings say, “Never muzzle an ox when it is threshing 
1CO.9.10	 Isn’t he speaking entirely for our benefit? This was written for our benefit so that the person who plows or threshes should expect to receive a share of the crop. 
1CO.9.11	 If we have planted the spiritual seed that has been of benefit to you, is it too much if we receive part of the harvest from your earthly goods? 
1CO.9.12	 If others have the right to expect this from you, don’t we deserve even more? But we haven’t used our rights. Instead, we would put up with anything in order not to hinder the Good News of Christ in any way.
1CO.9.13	 Don’t you realize that those who work at the temple get their food from the temple? Don’t those who help at the altar get a share of what is on the altar? 
1CO.9.14	 In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who spread the Good News should earn their living from the Good News.
1CO.9.15	 I haven’t used any of these rights, and I haven’t written this in order to use them now. I would rather die than have anyone turn my bragging into meaningless words. 
1CO.9.16	 If I spread the Good News, I have nothing to brag about because I have an obligation to do this. How horrible it will be for me if I don’t spread the Good News! 
1CO.9.17	 If I spread the Good News willingly, I’ll have a reward. But if I spread the Good News unwillingly, I’m ⌊only⌋ doing what I’ve been entrusted to do.
1CO.9.18	 So what is my reward? It is to spread the Good News free of charge. In that way I won’t use the rights that belong to those who spread the Good News.
1CO.9.19	 Although I’m free from all people, I have made myself a slave for all people to win more of them. 
1CO.9.20	 I became Jewish for Jewish people. I became subject to the laws in Moses’ Teachings for those who are subject to those laws. I did this to win them even though I’m not subject to Moses’ Teachings. 
1CO.9.21	 I became like a person who does not have Moses’ Teachings for those who don’t have those teachings. I did this to win them even though I have God’s teachings. I’m really subject to Christ’s teachings. 
1CO.9.22	 I became like a person weak in faith to win those who are weak in faith. I have become everything to everyone in order to save at least some of them. 
1CO.9.23	 I do all this for the sake of the Good News in order to share what it offers.
1CO.9.24	 Don’t you realize that everyone who runs in a race runs to win, but only one runner gets the prize? Run like them, so that you can win. 
1CO.9.25	 Everyone who enters an athletic contest goes into strict training. They do it to win a temporary crown, but we do it to win one that will be permanent. 
1CO.9.26	 So I run—but not without a clear goal ahead of me. So I box—but not as if I were just shadow boxing. 
1CO.9.27	 Rather, I toughen my body with punches and make it my slave so that I will not be disqualified after I have spread the Good News to others.
1CO.10.1	 I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that all our ancestors ⌊who left Egypt⌋ were under the cloud, and they all went through the sea. 
1CO.10.2	 They were all united with Moses by baptism in the cloud and in the sea. 
1CO.10.3	 All of them ate the same spiritual food, 
1CO.10.4	 and all of them drank the same spiritual drink. They drank from the spiritual rock that went with them, and that rock was Christ. 
1CO.10.5	 Yet, God was not pleased with most of them, so their dead bodies were scattered over the desert.
1CO.10.6	 These things have become examples for us so that we won’t desire what is evil, as they did. 
1CO.10.7	 So don’t worship false gods as some of them did, as Scripture says, “The people sat down to a feast which turned into an orgy.” 
1CO.10.8	 We shouldn’t sin sexually as some of them did. Twenty-three thousand of them died on one day. 
1CO.10.9	 We shouldn’t put the Lord 
1CO.10.10	 Don’t complain as some of them did. The angel of death destroyed them. 
1CO.10.11	 These things happened to make them an example for others. These things were written down as a warning for us who are living in the closing days of history. 
1CO.10.12	 So, people who think they are standing firmly should be careful that they don’t fall.
1CO.10.13	 There isn’t any temptation that you have experienced which is unusual for humans. God, who faithfully keeps his promises, will not allow you to be tempted beyond your power to resist. But when you are tempted, he will also give you the ability to endure the temptation as your way of escape.
1CO.10.14	 Therefore, my dear friends, get as far away from the worship of false gods as you can.
1CO.10.15	 I’m talking to intelligent people. Judge for yourselves what I’m saying. 
1CO.10.16	 When we bless the cup of blessing aren’t we sharing in the blood of Christ? When we break the bread aren’t we sharing in the body of Christ? 
1CO.10.17	 Because there is one loaf, we are one body, although we are many individuals. All of us share one loaf.
1CO.10.18	 Look at the people of Israel from a human point of view. Don’t those who eat the sacrifices share what is on the altar? 
1CO.10.19	 Do I mean that an offering made to a false god is anything, or that a false god itself is anything? 
1CO.10.20	 Hardly! What I am saying is that these sacrifices which people make are made to demons and not to God. I don’t want you to be partners with demons. 
1CO.10.21	 You cannot drink the Lord’s cup and the cup of demons. You cannot participate at the table of the Lord and at the table of demons. 
1CO.10.22	 Are we trying to make the Lord jealous? Are we stronger than he is?
1CO.10.23	 Someone may say, “I’m allowed to do anything,” but not everything is helpful. I’m allowed to do anything, but not everything encourages growth. 
1CO.10.24	 People should be concerned about others and not just about themselves. 
1CO.10.25	 Eat anything that is sold in the market without letting your conscience trouble you. 
1CO.10.26	 Certainly, “The earth is the Lord’s and everything it contains is his.” 
1CO.10.27	 If an unbeliever invites you ⌊to his house for dinner⌋, and you wish to go, eat anything he serves you without letting your conscience trouble you. 
1CO.10.28	 However, if someone says to you, “This was sacrificed to a god,” don’t eat it because of the one who informed you and because of conscience. 
1CO.10.29	 I’m not talking about your conscience but the other person’s conscience. Why should my freedom be judged by someone else’s conscience? 
1CO.10.30	 If I give thanks to God for the food I eat, why am I condemned for that? 
1CO.10.31	 So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything to the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	 Don’t cause others to stumble, whether they are Jewish, Greek, or members of God’s church. 
1CO.10.33	 I try to please everyone in every way. I don’t think about what would be good for me but about what would be good for many people so that they might be saved.
1CO.11.1	 Imitate me as I imitate Christ.
1CO.11.1	   
1CO.11.2	 I praise you for always thinking about me and for carefully following the traditions that I handed down to you.
1CO.11.3	 However, I want you to realize that Christ has authority over every man, a husband has authority over his wife, and God has authority over Christ. 
1CO.11.4	 Every man who covers his head when he prays or speaks what God has revealed dishonors the one who has authority over him. 
1CO.11.5	 Every woman who prays or speaks what God has revealed and has her head uncovered while she speaks dishonors the one who has authority over her. She is like the woman who has her head shaved. 
1CO.11.6	 So if a woman doesn’t cover her head, she should cut off her hair. If it’s a disgrace for a woman to cut off her hair or shave her head, she should cover her head. 
1CO.11.7	 A man should not cover his head. He is God’s image and glory. The woman, however, is man’s glory. 
1CO.11.8	 Clearly, man wasn’t made from woman but woman from man. 
1CO.11.9	 Man wasn’t created for woman but woman for man. 
1CO.11.10	 Therefore, a woman should wear something on her head to show she is under ⌊someone’s⌋ authority, out of respect for the angels.
1CO.11.11	 Yet, as believers in the Lord, women couldn’t exist without men and men couldn’t exist without women. 
1CO.11.12	 As a woman came into existence from a man, so men come into existence by women, but everything comes from God.
1CO.11.13	 Judge your own situation. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
1CO.11.14	 Doesn’t nature itself teach you that it is disgraceful for a man to have long hair? 
1CO.11.15	 Doesn’t it teach you that it is a woman’s pride to wear her hair long? Her hair is given to her in place of a covering. 
1CO.11.16	 If anyone wants to argue about this ⌊they can’t, because⌋ we don’t have any custom like this—nor do any of the churches of God.
1CO.11.17	 I have no praise for you as I instruct you in the following matter: When you gather, it results in more harm than good. 
1CO.11.18	 In the first place, I hear that when you gather as a church you split up into opposing groups. I believe some of what I hear. 
1CO.11.19	 Factions have to exist in order to make it clear who the genuine believers among you are.
1CO.11.20	 When you gather in the same place, you can’t possibly be eating the Lord’s Supper. 
1CO.11.21	 Each of you eats his own supper ⌊without waiting for each other⌋. So one person goes hungry and another gets drunk. 
1CO.11.22	 Don’t you have homes in which to eat and drink? Do you despise God’s church and embarrass people who don’t have anything to eat? What can I say to you? Should I praise you? I won’t praise you for this. 
1CO.11.23	 After all, I passed on to you what I had received from the Lord.
1CO.11.23	On the night he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread 
1CO.11.24	 and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving. He broke the bread and said, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me.” 
1CO.11.25	 When supper was over, he did the same with the cup. He said, “This cup is the new promise 
1CO.11.26	 Every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you tell about the Lord’s death until he comes.
1CO.11.27	 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks from the Lord’s cup in an improper way will be held responsible for the Lord’s body and blood. 
1CO.11.28	 With this in mind, individuals must determine whether what they are doing is proper when they eat the bread and drink from the cup. 
1CO.11.29	 Anyone who eats and drinks is eating and drinking a judgment against himself when he doesn’t recognize the Lord’s body.
1CO.11.30	 This is the reason why many of you are weak and sick and quite a number ⌊of you⌋ have died. 
1CO.11.31	 If we were judging ourselves correctly, we would not be judged. 
1CO.11.32	 But when the Lord judges us, he disciplines us so that we won’t be condemned along with the rest of the world.
1CO.11.33	 Therefore, brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, wait for each other. 
1CO.11.34	 Whoever is hungry should eat at home so that you don’t have a gathering that brings judgment on you.
1CO.11.34	I will give directions concerning the other matters when I come.
1CO.12.1	 Brothers and sisters, I don’t want there to be any misunderstanding concerning spiritual gifts. 
1CO.12.2	 You know that when you were unbelievers, every time you were led to worship false gods you were worshiping gods who couldn’t even speak. 
1CO.12.3	 So I want you to know that no one speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is cursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.4	 There are different spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit gives them. 
1CO.12.5	 There are different ways of serving, and yet the same Lord is served. 
1CO.12.6	 There are different types of work to do, but the same God produces every gift in every person.
1CO.12.7	 The evidence of the Spirit’s presence is given to each person for the common good of everyone. 
1CO.12.8	 The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak with wisdom. The same Spirit gives another person the ability to speak with knowledge. 
1CO.12.9	 To another person the same Spirit gives ⌊courageous⌋ faith. To another person the same Spirit gives the ability to heal. 
1CO.12.10	 Another can work miracles. Another can speak what God has revealed. Another can tell the difference between spirits. Another can speak in different kinds of languages. Another can interpret languages. 
1CO.12.11	 There is only one Spirit who does all these things by giving what God wants to give to each person.
1CO.12.12	 For example, the body is one unit and yet has many parts. As all the parts form one body, so it is with Christ. 
1CO.12.13	 By one Spirit we were all baptized into one body. Whether we are Jewish or Greek, slave or free, God gave all of us one Spirit to drink.
1CO.12.14	 As you know, the human body is not made up of only one part, but of many parts. 
1CO.12.15	 Suppose a foot says, “I’m not a hand, so I’m not part of the body!” Would that mean it’s no longer part of the body? 
1CO.12.16	 Or suppose an ear says, “I’m not an eye, so I’m not a part of the body!” Would that mean it’s no longer part of the body? 
1CO.12.17	 If the whole body were an eye, how could it hear? If the whole body were an ear, how could it smell? 
1CO.12.18	 So God put each and every part of the body together as he wanted it. 
1CO.12.19	 How could it be a body if it only had one part? 
1CO.12.20	 So there are many parts but one body.
1CO.12.21	 An eye can’t say to a hand, “I don’t need you!” Or again, the head can’t say to the feet, “I don’t need you!” 
1CO.12.22	 The opposite is true. The parts of the body that we think are weaker are the ones we really need. 
1CO.12.23	 The parts of the body that we think are less honorable are the ones we give special honor. So our unpresentable parts are made more presentable. 
1CO.12.24	 However, our presentable parts don’t need this kind of treatment. God has put the body together and given special honor to the part that doesn’t have it. 
1CO.12.25	 God’s purpose was that the body should not be divided but rather that all of its parts should feel the same concern for each other. 
1CO.12.26	 If one part of the body suffers, all the other parts share its suffering. If one part is praised, all the others share in its happiness.
1CO.12.27	 You are Christ’s body and each of you is an individual part of it. 
1CO.12.28	 In the church God has appointed first apostles, next prophets, third teachers, then those who perform miracles, then those who have the gift of healing, then those who help others, those who are managers, and those who can speak in a number of languages. 
1CO.12.29	 Not all believers are apostles, are they? Are all of them prophets? Do all of them teach? Do all of them perform miracles 
1CO.12.30	 or have gifts of healing? Can all of them speak in other languages or interpret languages?
1CO.12.31	 You ⌊only⌋ want the better gifts, but I will show you the best thing to do.
1CO.13.1	 I may speak in the languages of humans and of angels. But if I don’t have love, I am a loud gong or a clashing cymbal. 
1CO.13.2	 I may have the gift to speak what God has revealed, and I may understand all mysteries and have all knowledge. I may even have enough faith to move mountains. But if I don’t have love, I am nothing. 
1CO.13.3	 I may even give away all that I have and give up my body to be burned.
1CO.13.4	 Love is patient. Love is kind. Love isn’t jealous. It doesn’t sing its own praises. It isn’t arrogant. 
1CO.13.5	 It isn’t rude. It doesn’t think about itself. It isn’t irritable. It doesn’t keep track of wrongs. 
1CO.13.6	 It isn’t happy when injustice is done, but it is happy with the truth. 
1CO.13.7	 Love never stops being patient, never stops believing, never stops hoping, never gives up.
1CO.13.8	 Love never comes to an end. There is the gift of speaking what God has revealed, but it will no longer be used. There is the gift of speaking in other languages, but it will stop by itself. There is the gift of knowledge, but it will no longer be used. 
1CO.13.9	 Our knowledge is incomplete and our ability to speak what God has revealed is incomplete. 
1CO.13.10	 But when what is complete comes, then what is incomplete will no longer be used. 
1CO.13.11	 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, and reasoned like a child. When I became an adult, I no longer used childish ways. 
1CO.13.12	 Now we see a blurred image in a mirror. Then we will see very clearly. Now my knowledge is incomplete. Then I will have complete knowledge as God has complete knowledge of me.
1CO.13.13	 So these three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the best one of these is love.
1CO.14.1	 Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but especially the gift of speaking what God has revealed. 
1CO.14.2	 When a person speaks in another language, he doesn’t speak to people but to God. No one understands him. His spirit is speaking mysteries. 
1CO.14.3	 But when a person speaks what God has revealed, he speaks to people to help them grow, to encourage them, and to comfort them. 
1CO.14.4	 When a person speaks in another language, he helps himself grow. But when a person speaks what God has revealed, he helps the church grow. 
1CO.14.5	 I wish that all of you could speak in other languages, but especially that you could speak what God has revealed. The person who speaks what God has revealed is more important than the person who speaks in other languages. This is true unless he can interpret what he says to help the church grow. 
1CO.14.6	 Brothers and sisters, it wouldn’t do you any good if I came to you speaking in other languages, unless I explained revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or doctrine to you.
1CO.14.7	 Musical instruments like the flute or harp produce sounds. If there is no difference in the notes, how can a person tell what tune is being played? 
1CO.14.8	 For example, if the trumpet doesn’t sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? 
1CO.14.9	 In the same way, if you don’t speak in a way that can be understood, how will anyone know what you’re saying? You will be talking into thin air.
1CO.14.10	 No matter how many different languages there are in the world, not one of them is without meaning. 
1CO.14.11	 If I don’t know what a language means, I will be a foreigner to the person who speaks it and that person will be a foreigner to me. 
1CO.14.12	 In the same way, since you’re eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in them so that you help the church grow. 
1CO.14.13	 So the person who speaks in another language should pray for an interpretation of what he says.
1CO.14.14	 If I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my mind is not productive. 
1CO.14.15	 So what does this mean? It means that I will pray with my spirit, and I will pray with my mind. I will sing psalms with my spirit, and I will sing psalms with my mind. 
1CO.14.16	 Otherwise, if you praise God only with your spirit, how can outsiders say “Amen!” to your prayer of thanksgiving? They don’t know what you’re saying. 
1CO.14.17	 Your prayer of thanksgiving may be very good, but it doesn’t help other people grow. 
1CO.14.18	 I thank God that I speak in other languages more than any of you. 
1CO.14.19	 Yet, in order to teach others in church, I would rather say five words that can be understood than ten thousand words in another language.
1CO.14.20	 Brothers and sisters, don’t think like children. When it comes to evil, be like babies, but think like mature people. 
1CO.14.21	 God’s word says,
1CO.14.21	“Through people who speak foreign languages
1CO.14.21	and through the mouths of foreigners
1CO.14.21	I will speak to these people,
1CO.14.21	but even then they will not listen to me,
1CO.14.21	says the Lord.”
1CO.14.22	 So the gift of speaking in other languages is a sign for unbelievers, not for believers. The gift of speaking what God has revealed is a sign for believers, not for unbelievers. 
1CO.14.23	 Suppose the whole congregation gathers in the same place and you speak in other languages. When outsiders or unbelievers come in, won’t they say that you’re out of your mind? 
1CO.14.24	 Now suppose you speak what God has revealed. When unbelievers or outsiders come in you will show them where they are wrong and convince them that they are sinners. 
1CO.14.25	 The secrets in their hearts will become known, and in this way they will quickly bow with their faces touching the ground, worship God, and confess that God is truly among you.
1CO.14.26	 So what does this mean, brothers and sisters? When you gather, each person has a psalm, doctrine, revelation, another language, or an interpretation. Everything must be done to help each other grow. 
1CO.14.27	 If people speak in other languages, only two or three at the most should speak. They should do it one at a time, and someone must interpret what each person says. 
1CO.14.28	 But if an interpreter isn’t present, those people should remain silent in church. They should only speak to themselves and to God.
1CO.14.29	 Two or three people should speak what God has revealed. Everyone else should decide whether what each person said is right or wrong. 
1CO.14.30	 If God reveals something to another person who is seated, the first speaker should be silent. 
1CO.14.31	 All of you can take your turns speaking what God has revealed. In that way, everyone will learn and be encouraged. 
1CO.14.32	 People who speak what God has revealed must control themselves. 
1CO.14.33	 God is not a God of disorder but a God of peace.
1CO.14.33	As in all the churches of God’s holy people, 
1CO.14.34	 the women must keep silent. They don’t have the right to speak. They must take their place as Moses’ Teachings say. 
1CO.14.35	 If they want to know anything they should ask their husbands at home. It’s shameful for a woman to speak in church. 
1CO.14.36	 Did God’s word originate with you? Are you the only ones it has reached?
1CO.14.37	 Whoever thinks that he speaks for God or that he is spiritually gifted must acknowledge that what I write to you is what the Lord commands. 
1CO.14.38	 But whoever ignores what I write should be ignored.
1CO.14.39	 So, brothers and sisters, desire to speak what God has revealed, and don’t keep anyone from speaking in other languages. 
1CO.14.40	 Everything must be done in a proper and orderly way.
1CO.15.1	 Brothers and sisters, I’m making known to you the Good News which I already told you, which you received, and on which your faith is based. 
1CO.15.2	 In addition, you are saved by this Good News if you hold on to the doctrine I taught you, unless you believed it without thinking it over. 
1CO.15.3	 I passed on to you the most important points of doctrine that I had received:
1CO.15.3	Christ died to take away our sins as the Scriptures predicted.
1CO.15.4	 He was placed in a tomb.
1CO.15.4	He was brought back to life on the third day as the Scriptures predicted.
1CO.15.5	 He appeared to Cephas.
1CO.15.6	 Then he appeared to more than 500 believers at one time. (Most of these people are still living, but some have died.) 
1CO.15.7	 Next he appeared to James. Then he appeared to all the apostles. 
1CO.15.8	 Last of all, he also appeared to me.
1CO.15.8	I’m like an aborted fetus ⌊who was given life⌋. 
1CO.15.9	 I’m the least of the apostles. I’m not even fit to be called an apostle because I persecuted God’s church. 
1CO.15.10	 But God’s kindness 
1CO.15.11	 So, whether it was I or someone else, this is the message we brought you, and this is what you believed.
1CO.15.12	 If we have told you that Christ has been brought back to life, how can some of you say that coming back from the dead is impossible? 
1CO.15.13	 If the dead can’t be brought back to life, then Christ hasn’t come back to life. 
1CO.15.14	 If Christ hasn’t come back to life, our message has no meaning and your faith also has no meaning. 
1CO.15.15	 In addition, we are obviously witnesses who lied about God because we testified that he brought Christ back to life. But if it’s true that the dead don’t come back to life, then God didn’t bring Christ back to life. 
1CO.15.16	 Certainly, if the dead don’t come back to life, then Christ hasn’t come back to life either. 
1CO.15.17	 If Christ hasn’t come back to life, your faith is worthless and sin still has you in its power. 
1CO.15.18	 Then those who have died as believers in Christ no longer exist. 
1CO.15.19	 If Christ is our hope in this life only, we deserve more pity than any other people.
1CO.15.20	 But now Christ has come back from the dead. He is the very first person of those who have died to come back to life. 
1CO.15.21	 Since a man brought death, a man also brought life back from death. 
1CO.15.22	 As everyone dies because of Adam, so also everyone will be made alive because of Christ. 
1CO.15.23	 This will happen to each person in his own turn. Christ is the first, then at his coming, those who belong to him ⌊will be made alive⌋. 
1CO.15.24	 Then the end will come. Christ will hand over the kingdom to God the Father as he destroys every ruler, authority, and power.
1CO.15.25	 Christ must rule until God has put every enemy under his control. 
1CO.15.26	 The last enemy he will destroy is death. 
1CO.15.27	 Clearly, God has put everything under Christ’s authority. When God says that everything has been put under Christ’s authority, this clearly excludes God, since God has put everything under Christ’s authority. 
1CO.15.28	 But when God puts everything under Christ’s authority, the Son will put himself under God’s authority, since God had put everything under the Son’s authority. Then God will be in control of everything.
1CO.15.29	 However, people are baptized because the dead ⌊will come back to life⌋. What will they do? If the dead can’t come back to life, why do people get baptized as if they can ⌊come back to life⌋?
1CO.15.30	 Why are we constantly putting ourselves in danger? 
1CO.15.31	 Brothers and sisters, I swear to you on my pride in you which Christ Jesus our Lord has given me: I face death every day. 
1CO.15.32	 If I have fought with wild animals in Ephesus, what have I gained according to the way people look at things? If the dead are not brought back to life, “Let’s eat and drink because tomorrow we’re going to die!” 
1CO.15.33	 Don’t let anyone deceive you. Associating with bad people will ruin decent people. 
1CO.15.34	 Come back to the right point of view, and stop sinning. Some people don’t know anything about God. You should be ashamed of yourselves.
1CO.15.35	 But someone will ask, “How do the dead come back to life? With what kind of body will they come back?”
1CO.15.36	 You fool! The seed you plant doesn’t come to life unless it dies first. 
1CO.15.37	 What you plant, whether it’s wheat or something else, is only a seed. It doesn’t have the form that the plant will have. 
1CO.15.38	 God gives the plant the form he wants it to have. Each kind of seed grows into its own form. 
1CO.15.39	 Not all flesh is the same. Humans have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds have another, and fish have still another. 
1CO.15.40	 There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. Heavenly bodies don’t all have the same splendor, neither do earthly bodies. 
1CO.15.41	 The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon has another kind of splendor, and the stars have still another kind of splendor. Even one star differs in splendor from another star.
1CO.15.42	 That is how it will be when the dead come back to life. When the body is planted, it decays. When it comes back to life, it cannot decay. 
1CO.15.43	 When the body is planted, it doesn’t have any splendor and is weak. When it comes back to life, it has splendor and is strong. 
1CO.15.44	 It is planted as a physical body. It comes back to life as a spiritual body. As there is a physical body, so there is also a spiritual body.
1CO.15.45	 This is what Scripture says: “The first man, Adam, became a living being.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 
1CO.15.46	 The spiritual does not come first, but the physical and then the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	 The first man was made from the dust of the earth. He came from the earth. The second man came from heaven. 
1CO.15.48	 The people on earth are like the man who was made from the dust of the earth. The people in heaven are like the man who came from heaven. 
1CO.15.49	 As we have worn the likeness of the man who was made from the dust of the earth, we will also wear the likeness of the man who came from heaven. 
1CO.15.50	 Brothers and sisters, this is what I mean: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. What decays cannot inherit what doesn’t decay.
1CO.15.51	 I’m telling you a mystery. Not all of us will die, but we will all be changed. 
1CO.15.52	 It will happen in an instant, in a split second at the sound of the last trumpet. Indeed, that trumpet will sound, and then the dead will come back to life. They will be changed so that they can live forever. 
1CO.15.53	 This body that decays must be changed into a body that cannot decay. This mortal body must be changed into a body that will live forever. 
1CO.15.54	 When this body that decays is changed into a body that cannot decay, and this mortal body is changed into a body that will live forever, then the teaching of Scripture will come true:
1CO.15.54	“Death is turned into victory!
1CO.15.55	 Death, where is your victory?
1CO.15.55	Death, where is your sting?”
1CO.15.56	 Sin gives death its sting, and God’s standards give sin its power. 
1CO.15.57	 Thank God that he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.15.58	 So, then, brothers and sisters, don’t let anyone move you off the foundation ⌊of your faith⌋. Always excel in the work you do for the Lord. You know that the hard work you do for the Lord is not pointless.
1CO.16.1	 Now, concerning the money to be collected for God’s people ⌊in Jerusalem⌋: I want you to do as I directed the churches in Galatia. 
1CO.16.2	 Every Sunday each of you should set aside some of your money and save it. Then money won’t have to be collected when I come. 
1CO.16.3	 When I come, I will give letters of introduction to the people whom you choose. You can send your gift to Jerusalem with them. 
1CO.16.4	 If I think it’s worthwhile for me to go, they can go with me.
1CO.16.5	 After I go through the province of Macedonia, I’ll visit you. (I will be going through Macedonia.) 
1CO.16.6	 I’ll probably stay with you. I might even spend the winter. Then you can give me your support as I travel, wherever I decide to go. 
1CO.16.7	 Right now all I could do is visit you briefly, but if the Lord lets me, I hope to spend some time with you. 
1CO.16.8	 I will be staying here in Ephesus until Pentecost. 
1CO.16.9	 I have a great opportunity to do effective work here, although there are many people who oppose me.
1CO.16.10	 If Timothy comes, make sure that he doesn’t have anything to be afraid of while he is with you. He’s doing the Lord’s work as I am, 
1CO.16.11	 so no one should treat him with contempt. Without quarreling, give him your support for his trip so that he may come to me. I’m expecting him to arrive with the other Christians.
1CO.16.12	 Concerning Apollos, our brother in the Christian faith: I tried hard to get him to visit you with the other Christians. He didn’t want to at this time. However, he will visit you when he has an opportunity.
1CO.16.13	 Be alert. Be firm in the Christian faith. Be courageous and strong. 
1CO.16.14	 Do everything with love.
1CO.16.15	 You know that the family of Stephanas was the first family to be won ⌊for Christ⌋ in Greece. This family has devoted itself to serving God’s people. So I encourage you, brothers and sisters, 
1CO.16.16	 to follow the example of people like these and anyone else who shares their labor and hard work. 
1CO.16.17	 I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus came here. They have made up for your absence. 
1CO.16.18	 They have comforted me, and they have comforted you. Therefore, show people like these your appreciation.
1CO.16.19	 The churches in the province of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca and the church that meets in their house send their warmest Christian greetings. 
1CO.16.20	 All the brothers and sisters ⌊here⌋ greet you. Greet each other with a holy kiss. 
1CO.16.21	 I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand.
1CO.16.22	 If anyone doesn’t love the Lord, let him be cursed! Our Lord, come!
1CO.16.23	 May the good will 
1CO.16.24	 Through Christ Jesus my love is with all of you.
2CO.1.1	 From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and from Timothy our brother.
2CO.1.1	To God’s church in the city of Corinth and to all God’s holy people everywhere in Greece.
2CO.1.2	 Good will 
2CO.1.3	 Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He is the Father who is compassionate and the God who gives comfort. 
2CO.1.4	 He comforts us whenever we suffer. That is why whenever other people suffer, we are able to comfort them by using the same comfort we have received from God. 
2CO.1.5	 Because Christ suffered so much for us, we can receive so much comfort from him. 
2CO.1.6	 Besides, if we suffer, it brings you comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, we can effectively comfort you when you endure the same sufferings that we endure. 
2CO.1.7	 We have confidence in you. We know that as you share our sufferings, you also share our comfort.
2CO.1.8	 Brothers and sisters, we don’t want you to be ignorant about the suffering we experienced in the province of Asia. It was so extreme that it was beyond our ability to endure. We even wondered if we could go on living. 
2CO.1.9	 In fact, we still feel as if we’re under a death sentence. But we suffered so that we would stop trusting ourselves and learn to trust God, who brings the dead back to life. 
2CO.1.10	 He has rescued us from a terrible death, and he will rescue us in the future. We are confident that he will continue to rescue us, 
2CO.1.11	 since you are also joining to help us when you pray for us. Then many people will thank God for the favor he will show us because many people prayed for us.
2CO.1.12	 We are proud that our conscience is clear. We are proud of the way that we have lived in this world. We have lived with a God-given holiness 
2CO.1.13	 We are only writing you what you already knew before you read this. I hope you will understand this as long as you live, 
2CO.1.14	 even though you now understand it only partially. We are your reason to be proud, as you will be our reason to be proud on the day of our Lord Jesus.
2CO.1.15	 Confident of this, I had previously wanted to visit you so that you could benefit twice. 
2CO.1.16	 My plans had been to go from the city of Corinth to the province of Macedonia. Then from Macedonia I had planned to return to you again in Corinth and have you support my trip to Judea.
2CO.1.17	 You don’t think that I made these plans lightly, do you? Do you think that when I make plans, I make them in a sinful way? Why would I say that something is true when it isn’t? 
2CO.1.18	 You can depend on God. Our message to you isn’t false; it’s true. 
2CO.1.19	 God’s Son, Jesus Christ, whom I, Silvanus, and Timothy told you about, was true not false. Because of him our message was always true. 
2CO.1.20	 Certainly, Christ made God’s many promises come true. For that reason, because of our message, people also honor God by saying, “Amen!”
2CO.1.21	 God establishes us, together with you, in a relationship with Christ. He has also anointed us. 
2CO.1.22	 In addition, he has put his seal ⌊of ownership⌋ on us and has given us the Spirit as his guarantee.
2CO.1.23	 I appeal to God as a witness on my behalf, that I stayed away from Corinth because I wanted to spare you. 
2CO.1.24	 It isn’t that we want to have control over your Christian faith. Rather, we want to work with you so that you will be happy. Certainly, you are firmly established in the Christian faith.
2CO.2.1	 I decided not to visit you again while I was distressed. 
2CO.2.2	 After all, if I had made you uncomfortable, how could you have cheered me up when you were uncomfortable?
2CO.2.3	 This is the very reason I wrote to you. I didn’t want to visit you and be distressed by those who should make me happy. I’m confident about all of you that whatever makes me happy also makes you happy.
2CO.2.4	 I was deeply troubled and anguished. In fact, I had tears in my eyes when I wrote to you. I didn’t write to make you uncomfortable but to let you know how much I love you.
2CO.2.5	 If someone caused distress, I’m not the one really affected. To some extent—although I don’t want to emphasize this too much—it has affected all of you. 
2CO.2.6	 The majority of you have imposed a severe enough punishment on that person. 
2CO.2.7	 So now forgive and comfort him. Such distress could overwhelm someone like that if he’s not forgiven and comforted. 
2CO.2.8	 That is why I urge you to assure him that you love him. 
2CO.2.9	 I had also written to you to test you. I wanted to see if you would be obedient in every way.
2CO.2.10	 If you forgive someone, so do I. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did in the presence of Christ for your benefit. 
2CO.2.11	 I don’t want Satan to outwit us. After all, we are not ignorant about Satan’s scheming.
2CO.2.12	 When I went to the city of Troas, the Lord gave me an opportunity to spread the Good News about Christ. 
2CO.2.13	 But I didn’t have any peace of mind, because I couldn’t find Titus, our brother, there. So I said goodbye to the people in Troas and went to the province of Macedonia.
2CO.2.14	 But I thank God, who always leads us in victory because of Christ. Wherever we go, God uses us to make clear what it means to know Christ. It’s like a fragrance that fills the air. 
2CO.2.15	 To God we are the aroma of Christ among those who are saved and among those who are dying. 
2CO.2.16	 To some people we are a deadly fragrance, while to others we are a life-giving fragrance.
2CO.2.16	Who is qualified to tell about Christ? 
2CO.2.17	 At least we don’t go around selling an impure word of God like many others. The opposite is true. As Christ’s spokesmen and in God’s presence, we speak the pure message that comes from God.
2CO.3.1	 Do we have to show you our qualifications again? Do we, like some people, need letters that recommend us to you or letters from you that recommend us to others? 
2CO.3.2	 You’re our letter of recommendation written in our hearts that everyone knows and reads. 
2CO.3.3	 It’s clear that you are Christ’s letter, written as a result of our ministry. You are a letter written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, a letter written not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
2CO.3.4	 Christ gives us confidence about you in God’s presence. 
2CO.3.5	 By ourselves we are not qualified in any way to claim that we can do anything. Rather, God makes us qualified. 
2CO.3.6	 He has also qualified us to be ministers of a new promise,
2CO.3.7	 The ministry that brought death was inscribed on stone. Yet, it came with such glory that the people of Israel couldn’t look at Moses’ face. His face was shining with glory, even though that glory was fading. 
2CO.3.8	 Won’t the ministry that brings the Spirit have even more glory? 
2CO.3.9	 If the ministry that brings punishment has glory, then the ministry that brings God’s approval has an overwhelming glory. 
2CO.3.10	 In fact, the ministry that brings punishment lost its glory because of the superior glory of the other ministry. 
2CO.3.11	 If that former ministry faded away despite its glory, how much more does that ministry which remains continue to be glorious?
2CO.3.12	 Since we have confidence ⌊in the new promise⌋, we speak very boldly. 
2CO.3.13	 We are not like Moses. He kept covering his face with a veil. He didn’t want the people of Israel to see the glory fading away. 
2CO.3.14	 However, their minds became closed. In fact, to this day the same veil is still there when they read the Old Testament. It isn’t removed, because only Christ can remove it. 
2CO.3.15	 Yet, even today, when they read the books of Moses, a veil covers their minds. 
2CO.3.16	 But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
2CO.3.17	 This Lord is the Spirit. Wherever the Lord’s Spirit is, there is freedom. 
2CO.3.18	 As all of us reflect the Lord’s glory with faces that are not covered with veils, we are being changed into his image with ever-increasing glory. This comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
2CO.4.1	 We don’t become discouraged, since God has given us this ministry through his mercy. 
2CO.4.2	 Instead, we have refused to use secret and shameful ways. We don’t use tricks, and we don’t distort God’s word. As God watches, we clearly reveal the truth to everyone. This is our ⌊letter of⌋ recommendation.
2CO.4.3	 So if the Good News that we tell others is covered with a veil, it is hidden from those who are dying. 
2CO.4.4	 The god of this world has blinded the minds of those who don’t believe. As a result, they don’t see the light of the Good News about Christ’s glory. It is Christ who is God’s image.
2CO.4.5	 Our message is not about ourselves. It is about Jesus Christ as the Lord. We are your servants for his sake. 
2CO.4.6	 We are his servants because the same God who said that light should shine out of darkness has given us light. For that reason we bring to light the knowledge about God’s glory which shines from Christ’s face.
2CO.4.7	 Our bodies are made of clay, yet we have the treasure of the Good News in them. This shows that the superior power of this treasure belongs to God and doesn’t come from us. 
2CO.4.8	 In every way we’re troubled, but we aren’t crushed by our troubles. We’re frustrated, but we don’t give up. 
2CO.4.9	 We’re persecuted, but we’re not abandoned. We’re captured, but we’re not killed. 
2CO.4.10	 We always carry around the death of Jesus in our bodies so that the life of Jesus is also shown in our bodies. 
2CO.4.11	 While we are alive, we are constantly handed over to death for Jesus’ sake so that the life of Jesus is also shown in our mortal nature. 
2CO.4.12	 Death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
2CO.4.13	 The following is written, “I believed; therefore, I spoke.” We have that same spirit of faith. We also believe; therefore, we also speak. 
2CO.4.14	 We know that the one who brought the Lord Jesus back to life will also bring us back to life through Jesus. He will present us to God together with you.
2CO.4.15	 All this is for your sake so that, as God’s kindness 
2CO.4.16	 That is why we are not discouraged. Though outwardly we are wearing out, inwardly we are renewed day by day. 
2CO.4.17	 Our suffering is light and temporary and is producing for us an eternal glory that is greater than anything we can imagine. 
2CO.4.18	 We don’t look for things that can be seen but for things that can’t be seen. Things that can be seen are only temporary. But things that can’t be seen last forever.
2CO.5.1	 We know that if the life we live here on earth is ever taken down like a tent, we still have a building from God. It is an eternal house in heaven that isn’t made by human hands. 
2CO.5.2	 In our present tent-like existence we sigh, since we long to put on the house we will have in heaven. 
2CO.5.3	 After we have put it on,
2CO.5.4	 While we are in this tent, we sigh. We feel distressed because we don’t want to take off the tent, but we do want to put on the eternal house. Then ⌊eternal⌋ life will put an end to our mortal existence. 
2CO.5.5	 God has prepared us for this and has given us his Spirit to guarantee it.
2CO.5.6	 So we are always confident. We know that as long as we are living in these bodies, we are living away from the Lord. 
2CO.5.7	 Indeed, our lives are guided by faith, not by sight. 
2CO.5.8	 We are confident and prefer to live away from this body and to live with the Lord. 
2CO.5.9	 Whether we live in the body or move out of it, our goal is to be pleasing to him. 
2CO.5.10	 All of us must appear in front of Christ’s judgment seat. Then all people will receive what they deserve for the good or evil they have done while living in their bodies.
2CO.5.11	 As people who know what it means to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others. God already knows what we are, and I hope that you also know what we are. 
2CO.5.12	 We are not trying to show you our qualifications again, but we are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us. Then you can answer those who are proud of their appearance rather than their character. 
2CO.5.13	 So if we were crazy, it was for God. If we are sane, it is for you. 
2CO.5.14	 Clearly, Christ’s love guides us. We are convinced of the fact that one man has died for all people. Therefore, all people have died. 
2CO.5.15	 He died for all people so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for the man who died and was brought back to life for them.
2CO.5.16	 So from now on we don’t think of anyone from a human point of view. If we did think of Christ from a human point of view, we don’t anymore. 
2CO.5.17	 Whoever is a believer in Christ is a new creation. The old way of living has disappeared. A new way of living has come into existence. 
2CO.5.18	 God has done all this. He has restored our relationship with him through Christ, and has given us this ministry of restoring relationships. 
2CO.5.19	 In other words, God was using Christ to restore his relationship with humanity. He didn’t hold people’s faults against them, and he has given us this message of restored relationships to tell others. 
2CO.5.20	 Therefore, we are Christ’s representatives, and through us God is calling you. We beg you on behalf of Christ to become reunited with God. 
2CO.5.21	 God had Christ, who was sinless, take our sin so that we might receive God’s approval through him.
2CO.6.1	 Since we are God’s coworkers, we urge you not to let God’s kindness 
2CO.6.2	 God says,
2CO.6.2	“At the right time I heard you.
2CO.6.2	On the day of salvation I helped you.”
2CO.6.2	Listen, now is God’s acceptable time! Now is the day of salvation!
2CO.6.3	 We don’t give people any opportunity to find fault with how we serve. 
2CO.6.4	 Instead, our lives demonstrate that we are God’s servants. We have endured many things: suffering, distress, anxiety, 
2CO.6.5	 beatings, imprisonments, riots, hard work, sleepless nights, and lack of food. 
2CO.6.6	 ⌊People can see⌋ our purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit’s presence ⌊in our lives⌋, our sincere love, 
2CO.6.7	 truthfulness, and the presence of God’s power. We demonstrate that we are God’s servants 
2CO.6.8	 as we are praised and dishonored, as we are slandered and honored, and as we use what is right to attack what is wrong and to defend the truth.
2CO.6.9	 as unknown although we are well-known, as dying although, as you see, we go on living. We are punished, but we are not killed. 
2CO.6.10	 People think we are sad although we’re always glad, that we’re beggars although we make many people spiritually rich, that we have nothing although we possess everything.
2CO.6.11	 We have been very open in speaking to you Corinthians. We have a place for you in our hearts. 
2CO.6.12	 We haven’t cut you off. Your own emotions have cut you off ⌊from us⌋. 
2CO.6.13	 I’m talking to you as I would talk to children. Treat us the same way we’ve treated you. Make a place for us in your hearts too.
2CO.6.14	 Stop forming inappropriate relationships with unbelievers. Can right and wrong be partners? Can light have anything in common with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	 Can Christ agree with the devil? Can a believer share life with an unbeliever? 
2CO.6.16	 Can God’s temple contain false gods? Clearly, we are the temple of the living God. As God said,
2CO.6.16	“I will live and walk among them.
2CO.6.16	I will be their God,
2CO.6.16	and they will be my people.”
2CO.6.17	 The Lord says, “Get away from unbelievers.
2CO.6.17	Separate yourselves from them.
2CO.6.17	Have nothing to do with anything unclean.
2CO.6.17	Then I will welcome you.”
2CO.6.18	 The Lord Almighty says, “I will be your Father,
2CO.6.18	and you will be my sons and daughters.”
2CO.7.1	 Since we have these promises, dear friends, we need to cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit and live a holy life in the fear of God.
2CO.7.2	 Open your hearts to us. We haven’t treated anyone unjustly, ruined anyone, or cheated anyone. 
2CO.7.3	 I’m not saying this to condemn you. I’ve already told you that you are in our hearts so that we will live and die together. 
2CO.7.4	 I have great confidence in you, and I have a lot of reasons to be proud of you. Even as we suffer, I’m encouraged and feel very happy.
2CO.7.5	 Ever since we arrived in the province of Macedonia, we’ve had no rest. Instead, we suffer in a number of ways. Outwardly we have conflicts, and inwardly we have fears. 
2CO.7.6	 Yet God, who comforts those who are dejected, comforted us when Titus arrived. 
2CO.7.7	 We were comforted not only by his arrival but also by learning about the comfort he had received while he was with you. He told us how you wanted to see me, how sorry you are for what you’ve done, and how concerned you are about me. This made me even happier.
2CO.7.8	 If my letter made you uncomfortable, I’m not sorry. But since my letter did make you uncomfortable for a while, I was sorry. 
2CO.7.9	 But I’m happy now, not because I made you uncomfortable, but because the distress I caused you has led you to change the way you think and act. You were distressed in a godly way, so we haven’t done you any harm. 
2CO.7.10	 In fact, to be distressed in a godly way causes people to change the way they think and act and leads them to be saved. No one can regret that. But the distress that the world causes brings only death.
2CO.7.11	 When you became distressed in a godly way, look at how much devotion it caused you to have. You were ready to clear yourselves of the charges against you. You were disgusted with the wrong that had been done. You were afraid. You wanted to see us. You wanted to show your concern for us. You were ready to punish the wrong that had been done. In every way you have demonstrated that you are people who are innocent in this matter. 
2CO.7.12	 So, when I wrote to you, I didn’t write because of the man who did the wrong or the man who was hurt by it. Rather, I wrote because I wanted you to show your devotion to us in God’s sight. 
2CO.7.13	 This is what has comforted us.
2CO.7.13	In addition to being comforted, we were especially pleased to see how happy Titus was. All of you had put his mind at ease. 
2CO.7.14	 I didn’t have to be ashamed of anything I had said to him when I bragged about you. Since everything we told you was true, our bragging to Titus has also proved to be true. 
2CO.7.15	 His deepest feelings go out to you even more as he remembers how obedient all of you were, and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling. 
2CO.7.16	 I’m pleased that I can be confident about you in every way.
2CO.8.1	 Brothers and sisters, we want you to know how God showed his kindness 
2CO.8.2	 While they were being severely tested by suffering, their overflowing joy, along with their extreme poverty, has made them even more generous. 
2CO.8.3	 I assure you that by their own free will they have given all they could, even more than they could afford. 
2CO.8.4	 They made an appeal to us, begging us to let them participate in the ministry of God’s kindness to his holy people ⌊in Jerusalem⌋. 
2CO.8.5	 They did more than we had expected. First, they gave themselves to the Lord and to us, since this was God’s will. 
2CO.8.6	 This led us to urge Titus to finish his work of God’s kindness among you in the same way as he had already started it.
2CO.8.7	 Indeed, the more your faith, your ability to speak, your knowledge, your dedication, and your love for us increase, the more we want you to participate in this work of God’s kindness.
2CO.8.8	 I’m not commanding you, but I’m testing how genuine your love is by pointing out the dedication of others. 
2CO.8.9	 You know about the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ. He was rich, yet for your sake he became poor in order to make you rich through his poverty.
2CO.8.10	 I’m giving you my opinion because it will be helpful to you. Last year you were not only willing ⌊to take a collection⌋ but had already started to do it. 
2CO.8.11	 So finish what you began to do. Then your willingness will be matched by what you accomplish 
2CO.8.12	 with whatever contributions you have. Since you are willing to do this, ⌊remember⌋ that people are accepted if they give what they are able to give. God doesn’t ask for what they don’t have.
2CO.8.13	 I don’t mean that others should have relief while you have hardship. Rather, it’s a matter of striking a balance. 
2CO.8.14	 At the present time, your surplus fills their need so that their surplus may fill your need. In this way things balance out. 
2CO.8.15	 This is what Scripture says: “Those who had gathered a lot didn’t have too much, and those who gathered a little didn’t have too little.”
2CO.8.16	 I thank God for making Titus as dedicated to you as I am. 
2CO.8.17	 He accepted my request and eagerly went to visit you by his own free will.
2CO.8.18	 With him we have sent our Christian brother whom all the churches praise for the way he tells the Good News. 
2CO.8.19	 More than that, the churches elected him to travel with us and bring this gift of God’s kindness. We are administering it in a way that brings glory to the Lord and shows that we are doing it willingly. 
2CO.8.20	 We don’t want anyone to find fault with the way we are administering this generous gift. 
2CO.8.21	 We intend to do what is right, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of people.
2CO.8.22	 We have also sent with them our Christian brother whom we have often tested in many ways and found to be a dedicated worker. We find that he is much more dedicated now than ever because he has so much confidence in you.
2CO.8.23	 If any questions are raised, remember that Titus is my partner and coworker to help you. The other men are representatives of the churches and bring glory to Christ. 
2CO.8.24	 So give these men a demonstration of your love. Show their congregations that we were right to be proud of you.
2CO.9.1	 I don’t need to write anything further to you about helping the Christians ⌊in Jerusalem⌋. 
2CO.9.2	 I know how willing you are to help, and I brag about you to the believers in the province of Macedonia. I tell them, “The people of Greece have been ready ⌊to send their collection⌋ since last year,” and your enthusiasm has moved most of them ⌊to act⌋. 
2CO.9.3	 I’ve sent my coworkers so that when we brag that you’re ready, we can back it up. 
2CO.9.4	 Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me, they might find out that you’re not ready after all. This would embarrass us for feeling so confident as much as it would embarrass you. 
2CO.9.5	 So I thought that I should encourage our coworkers to visit you before I do and make arrangements for this gift that you had already promised to give. Then it will be the blessing it was intended to be, and it won’t be something you’re forced to do.
2CO.9.6	 Remember this: The farmer who plants a few seeds will have a very small harvest. But the farmer who plants because he has received God’s blessings will receive a harvest of God’s blessings in return. 
2CO.9.7	 Each of you should give whatever you have decided. You shouldn’t be sorry that you gave or feel forced to give, since God loves a cheerful giver. 
2CO.9.8	 Besides, God will give you his constantly overflowing kindness.
2CO.9.9	 Scripture says,
2CO.9.9	“The righteous person gives freely to the poor.
2CO.9.9	His righteousness continues forever.”
2CO.9.10	 God gives seed to the farmer and food to those who need to eat. God will also give you seed and multiply it. In your lives he will increase the things you do that have his approval. 
2CO.9.11	 God will make you rich enough so that you can always be generous. Your generosity will produce thanksgiving to God because of us. 
2CO.9.12	 What you do to serve others not only provides for the needs of God’s people, but also produces more and more prayers of thanksgiving to God. 
2CO.9.13	 You will honor God through this genuine act of service because of your commitment to spread the Good News of Christ and because of your generosity in sharing with them and everyone else. 
2CO.9.14	 With deep affection they will pray for you because of the extreme kindness that God has shown you. 
2CO.9.15	 I thank God for his gift that words cannot describe.
2CO.10.1	 I, Paul, make my appeal to you with the gentleness and kindness of Christ. I’m the one who is humble when I’m with you but forceful toward you when I’m not with you. 
2CO.10.2	 I beg you that when I am with you I won’t have to deal forcefully with you. I expect I will have to because some people think that we are only guided by human motives. 
2CO.10.3	 Of course we are human, but we don’t fight like humans. 
2CO.10.4	 The weapons we use in our fight are not made by humans. Rather, they are powerful weapons from God. With them we destroy people’s defenses, that is, their arguments 
2CO.10.5	 and all their intellectual arrogance that oppose the knowledge of God. We take every thought captive so that it is obedient to Christ. 
2CO.10.6	 We are ready to punish every act of disobedience when you have become completely obedient.
2CO.10.7	 Look at the plain facts! If anyone is confident he belongs to Christ, he should take note that we also belong to Christ. 
2CO.10.8	 So, if I brag a little too much about the authority which the Lord gave us, I’m not ashamed. The Lord gave us this authority to help you, not to hurt you.
2CO.10.9	 I don’t want you to think that I’m trying to frighten you with my letters. 
2CO.10.10	 I know that someone is saying that my letters are powerful and strong, but that I’m a weakling and a terrible speaker. 
2CO.10.11	 The person who is saying those things should take note of this fact: When we are with you we will do the things that we wrote about in our letters when we weren’t with you.
2CO.10.12	 We wouldn’t put ourselves in the same class with or compare ourselves to those who are bold enough to make their own recommendations. Certainly, when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves to themselves, they show how foolish they are.
2CO.10.13	 How can we brag about things that no one can evaluate? Instead, we will only brag about what God has given us to do—coming to ⌊the city of Corinth⌋ where you live. 
2CO.10.14	 It’s not as though we hadn’t already been to Corinth. We’re not overstating the facts. The fact is that we were the first to arrive in Corinth with the Good News about Christ. 
2CO.10.15	 How can we brag about things done by others that can’t be evaluated?
2CO.10.15	We have confidence that as your faith grows, you will think enough of us to give us the help we need to carry out our assignment—
2CO.10.16	 spreading the Good News in the regions far beyond you. We won’t brag about things already accomplished by someone else.
2CO.10.17	 “Whoever brags should brag about what the Lord has done.” 
2CO.10.18	 It isn’t the person who makes his own recommendation who receives approval, but the person whom the Lord recommends.
2CO.11.1	 I want you to put up with a little foolishness from me. I’m sure that you will. 
2CO.11.2	 I’m as protective of you as God is. After all, you’re a virgin whom I promised in marriage to one man—Christ. 
2CO.11.3	 However, I’m afraid that as the snake deceived Eve by its tricks, so your minds may somehow be lured away from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 
2CO.11.4	 When someone comes to you telling about another Jesus whom we didn’t tell you about, you’re willing to put up with it. When you receive a spirit that is different from the Spirit you received earlier, you’re also willing to put up with that. When someone tells you good news that is different from the Good News you already accepted, you’re willing to put up with that too.
2CO.11.5	 I don’t think I’m inferior in any way to your super-apostles. 
2CO.11.6	 Even though I’m not good with words, I know what I’m talking about. Timothy and I have made this clear to you in every possible way.
2CO.11.7	 Did I commit a sin when I humbled myself by telling you the Good News of God free of charge so that you could become important? 
2CO.11.8	 I robbed other churches by taking pay from them to serve you. 
2CO.11.9	 When I was with you and needed something, I didn’t bother any of you for help. My friends from the province of Macedonia supplied everything I needed. I kept myself from being a financial burden to you in any way, and I will continue to do that.
2CO.11.10	 As surely as I have Christ’s truth, my bragging will not be silenced anywhere in Greece. 
2CO.11.11	 Why? Because I don’t love you? God knows that I do love you. 
2CO.11.12	 But I’ll go on doing what I’m doing. This will take away the opportunity of those people who want to brag because they think they’re like us. 
2CO.11.13	 People who brag like this are false apostles. They are dishonest workers, since they disguise themselves as Christ’s apostles. 
2CO.11.14	 And no wonder, even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	 So it’s not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants who have God’s approval. In the end they will get what they deserve.
2CO.11.16	 Again I say that no one should think that I’m a fool. But if you do, then take me for a fool so that I can also brag a little. 
2CO.11.17	 What I say as I start bragging is foolishness. It’s not something I would say if I were speaking for the Lord. 
2CO.11.18	 Since it’s common for people to brag, I’ll do it too. 
2CO.11.19	 You’re wise, so you’ll gladly put up with fools. 
2CO.11.20	 When someone makes you slaves, consumes your wealth, seizes your property, orders you around, or slaps your faces, you put up with it. 
2CO.11.21	 I’m ashamed to admit it, but Timothy and I don’t have the strength to do those things to you.
2CO.11.21	Whatever other people dare to brag about, I, like a fool, can also brag about. 
2CO.11.22	 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham’s descendants? So am I. 
2CO.11.23	 Are they Christ’s servants? It’s insane to say it, but I’m a far better one. I’ve done much more work, been in prison many more times, been beaten more severely, and have faced death more often. 
2CO.11.24	 Five times the Jewish leaders had me beaten with 39 lashes; 
2CO.11.25	 three times Roman officials had me beaten with clubs. Once people tried to stone me to death; three times I was shipwrecked, and I drifted on the sea for a night and a day. 
2CO.11.26	 Because I’ve traveled a lot, I’ve faced dangers from raging rivers, from robbers, from my own people, and from other people. I’ve faced dangers in the city, in the open country, on the sea, and from believers who turned out to be false friends. 
2CO.11.27	 Because I’ve had to work so hard, I’ve often gone without sleep, been hungry and thirsty, and gone without food and without proper clothes during cold weather. 
2CO.11.28	 Besides these external matters, I have the daily pressure of my anxiety about all the churches. 
2CO.11.29	 When anyone is weak, I’m weak too. When anyone is caught in a trap, I’m also harmed.
2CO.11.30	 If I must brag, I will brag about the things that show how weak I am. 
2CO.11.31	 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is praised forever, knows that I’m not lying. 
2CO.11.32	 The governor under King Aretas put guards around the city of Damascus to catch me. 
2CO.11.33	 So I was let down in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from him.
2CO.12.1	 I must brag, although it doesn’t do any good. I’ll go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	 I know a follower of Christ who was snatched away to the third heaven fourteen years ago. I don’t know whether this happened to him physically or spiritually. Only God knows. 
2CO.12.3	 I know that this person 
2CO.12.4	 was snatched away to paradise where he heard things that can’t be expressed in words, things that humans cannot put into words. I don’t know whether this happened to him physically or spiritually. Only God knows.
2CO.12.5	 I’ll brag about this person, but I won’t brag about myself unless it’s about my weaknesses.
2CO.12.6	 If I ever wanted to brag, I wouldn’t be a fool. Instead, I would be telling the truth. But I’m going to spare you so that no one may think more of me than what he sees or hears about me, 
2CO.12.7	 especially because of the excessive number of revelations that I’ve had.
2CO.12.7	Therefore, to keep me from becoming conceited, I am forced to deal with a recurring problem. That problem, Satan’s messenger, torments me to keep me from being conceited. 
2CO.12.8	 I begged the Lord three times to take it away from me. 
2CO.12.9	 But he told me: “My kindness 
2CO.12.10	 Therefore, I accept weakness, mistreatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties suffered for Christ. It’s clear that when I’m weak, I’m strong.
2CO.12.11	 I have become a fool. You forced me to be one. You should have recommended me to others. Even if I’m nothing, I wasn’t inferior in any way to your super-apostles. 
2CO.12.12	 While I was among you I patiently did the signs, wonders, and miracles which prove that I’m an apostle. 
2CO.12.13	 How were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I didn’t bother you for help? Forgive me for this wrong!
2CO.12.14	 I’m ready to visit you for a third time, and I won’t bother you for help. I don’t want your possessions. Instead, I want you. Children shouldn’t have to provide for their parents, but parents should provide for their children. 
2CO.12.15	 I will be very glad to spend whatever I have. I’ll even give myself for you. Do you love me less because I love you so much?
2CO.12.16	 You agree, then, that I haven’t been a burden to you. Was I a clever person who trapped you by some trick? 
2CO.12.17	 Did I take advantage of you through any of the men I sent you? 
2CO.12.18	 I encouraged Titus to visit you, and I sent my friend with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn’t we have the same motives and do things the same way?
2CO.12.19	 Have you been thinking all along that we’re trying to defend ourselves to you? We speak as Christ’s people in God’s sight. Everything we do, dear friends, is for your benefit.
2CO.12.20	 I’m afraid that I may come and find you different from what I want you to be, and that you may find me different from what you want me to be. I’m afraid that there may be rivalry, jealousy, hot tempers, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly conduct. 
2CO.12.21	 I’m afraid that when I come to you again, my God may humble me. I may have to grieve over many who formerly led sinful lives and have not changed the way they think and act about the perversion, sexual sins, and promiscuity in which they have been involved.
2CO.13.1	 This is the third time that I’ll be visiting you. Every accusation must be verified by two or three witnesses. 
2CO.13.2	 I already warned you when I was with you the second time, and even though I’m not there now, I’m warning you again. When I visit you again, I won’t spare you. That goes for all those who formerly led sinful lives as well as for all the others. 
2CO.13.3	 Since you want proof that Christ is speaking through me, that’s what you’ll get. Christ isn’t weak in dealing with you. Instead, he makes his power felt among you. 
2CO.13.4	 He was weak when he was crucified, but by God’s power he lives. We are weak with him, but by God’s power we will live for you with his help.
2CO.13.5	 Examine yourselves to see whether you are still in the Christian faith. Test yourselves! Don’t you recognize that you are people in whom Jesus Christ lives? Could it be that you’re failing the test? 
2CO.13.6	 I hope that you will realize that we haven’t failed the test. 
2CO.13.7	 We pray to God that you won’t do anything wrong. It’s not that we want to prove that we’ve passed the test. Rather, we want you to do whatever is right, even if we seem to have failed. 
2CO.13.8	 We can’t do anything against the truth but only to help the truth. 
2CO.13.9	 We’re glad when we are weak and you are strong. We are also praying for your improvement.
2CO.13.10	 That’s why I’m writing this letter while I’m not with you. When I am with you I don’t want to be harsh by using the authority that the Lord gave me. The Lord gave us this authority to help you, not to hurt you.
2CO.13.11	 With that, brothers and sisters, I must say goodbye. Make sure that you improve. Accept my encouragement. Share the same attitude and live in peace. The God of love and peace will be with you. 
2CO.13.12	 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All of God’s holy people greet you.
2CO.13.13	 May the Lord Jesus Christ’s good will,
GAL.1.1	 From Paul—an apostle ⌊chosen⌋ not by any group or individual but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who brought him back to life— 
GAL.1.2	 and all the believers who are with me.
GAL.1.2	To the churches in Galatia.
GAL.1.3	 Good will 
GAL.1.4	 In order to free us from this present evil world, Christ took the punishment for our sins, because that was what our God and Father wanted. 
GAL.1.5	 Glory belongs to our God and Father forever! Amen.
GAL.1.6	 I’m surprised that you’re so quickly deserting Christ, who called you in his kindness,
GAL.1.7	 But what some people are calling good news is not really good news at all. They are confusing you. They want to distort the Good News about Christ. 
GAL.1.8	 Whoever tells you good news that is different from the Good News we gave you should be condemned to hell, even if he is one of us or an angel from heaven. 
GAL.1.9	 I’m now telling you again what we’ve told you in the past: If anyone tells you good news that is different from the Good News you received, that person should be condemned to hell.
GAL.1.10	 Am I saying this now to win the approval of people or God? Am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be Christ’s servant.
GAL.1.11	 I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the Good News I have spread is not a human message. 
GAL.1.12	 I didn’t receive it from any person. I wasn’t taught it, but Jesus Christ revealed it to me.
GAL.1.13	 You heard about the way I once lived when I followed the Jewish religion. You heard how I violently persecuted God’s church and tried to destroy it. 
GAL.1.14	 You also heard how I was far ahead of other Jews in my age group in following the Jewish religion. I had become that fanatical for the traditions of my ancestors.
GAL.1.15	 But God, who appointed me before I was born and who called me by his kindness, was pleased 
GAL.1.16	 to show me his Son. He did this so that I would tell people who are not Jewish that his Son is the Good News. When this happened, I didn’t talk it over with any other person. 
GAL.1.17	 I didn’t even go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went to Arabia and then came back to Damascus.
GAL.1.18	 Then, three years later I went to Jerusalem to become personally acquainted with Cephas.
GAL.1.19	 I didn’t see any other apostle. I only saw James, the Lord’s brother. 
GAL.1.20	 (God is my witness that what I’m writing is not a lie.) 
GAL.1.21	 Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	 The churches of Christ in Judea didn’t know me personally. 
GAL.1.23	 The only thing they had heard was this: “The man who persecuted us is now spreading the faith that he once tried to destroy.” 
GAL.1.24	 So they praised God for what had happened to me.
GAL.2.1	 Then 14 years later I went to Jerusalem again with Barnabas. I also took Titus along. 
GAL.2.2	 I went in response to a revelation ⌊from God⌋. I showed them the way I spread the Good News among people who are not Jewish. I did this in a private meeting with those recognized as important people to see whether all my efforts had been wasted.
GAL.2.3	 Titus was with me, and although he is Greek, no one forced him to be circumcised.
GAL.2.4	 False Christians were brought in. They slipped in as spies to learn about the freedom Christ Jesus gives us. They hoped to find a way to control us. 
GAL.2.5	 But we did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the Good News would always be yours.
GAL.2.6	 Those who were recognized as important people didn’t add a single thing to my message. (What sort of people they were makes no difference to me, since God doesn’t play favorites.) 
GAL.2.7	 In fact, they saw that I had been entrusted with telling the Good News to people who are not circumcised as Peter had been entrusted to tell it to those who are circumcised. 
GAL.2.8	 The one who made Peter an apostle to Jewish people also made me an apostle to people who are not Jewish. 
GAL.2.9	 James, Cephas, and John (who were recognized as the most important people) acknowledged that God had given me this special gift.
GAL.2.10	 The only thing they asked us to do was to remember the poor, the very thing which I was eager to do.
GAL.2.11	 When Cephas came to Antioch, I had to openly oppose him because he was completely wrong. 
GAL.2.12	 He ate with people who were not Jewish until some men James had sent ⌊from Jerusalem⌋ arrived. Then Cephas drew back and would not associate with people who were not Jewish. He was afraid of those who insisted that circumcision was necessary. 
GAL.2.13	 The other Jewish Christians also joined him in this hypocrisy. Even Barnabas was swept along with them.
GAL.2.14	 But I saw that they were not properly following the truth of the Good News. So I told Cephas in front of everyone, “You’re Jewish, but you live like a person who is not Jewish. So how can you insist that people who are not Jewish must live like Jews?”
GAL.2.15	 We are Jewish by birth, not sinners from other nations. 
GAL.2.16	 Yet, we know that people don’t receive God’s approval by any effort to follow the laws in the Scriptures, but only by believing in Jesus Christ. So we also believed in Jesus Christ in order to receive God’s approval by faith in Christ and not by our own efforts. People won’t receive God’s approval by their own efforts.
GAL.2.17	 If we, the same people who are searching for God’s approval in Christ, are still sinners, does that mean that Christ encourages us to sin? That’s unthinkable! 
GAL.2.18	 If I rebuild something that I’ve torn down, I admit that I was wrong to tear it down. 
GAL.2.19	 When I tried to obey the laws in the Scriptures, those laws killed me. As a result, I live in a relationship with God. I have been crucified with Christ. 
GAL.2.20	 I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live I live by believing in God’s Son, who loved me and took the punishment for my sins. 
GAL.2.21	 I don’t reject God’s kindness.
GAL.3.1	 You stupid people of Galatia! Who put you under an evil spell? Wasn’t Christ Jesus’ crucifixion clearly described to you? 
GAL.3.2	 I want to learn only one thing from you. Did you receive the Spirit by your own efforts to follow the laws in the Scriptures or by believing what you heard? 
GAL.3.3	 Are you that stupid? Did you begin in a spiritual way only to end up doing things in a human way? 
GAL.3.4	 Did you suffer so much for nothing? ⌊I doubt⌋ that it was for nothing! 
GAL.3.5	 Does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you through your own efforts or through believing what you heard?
GAL.3.6	 Abraham serves as an example. He believed God, and that faith was regarded as the basis of Abraham’s approval by God. 
GAL.3.7	 You must understand that people who have faith are Abraham’s descendants. 
GAL.3.8	 Scripture saw ahead of time that God would give his approval to non-Jewish people who have faith. So Scripture announced the Good News to Abraham ahead of time when it said, “Through you all the people of the world will be blessed.” 
GAL.3.9	 So people who believe are blessed together with Abraham, the man of faith.
GAL.3.10	 Certainly, there is a curse on all who rely on their own efforts because Scripture says, “Whoever doesn’t obey everything that is written in Moses’ Teachings is cursed.” 
GAL.3.11	 No one receives God’s approval by obeying the laws in Moses’ Teachings since, “The person who has God’s approval will live by faith.” 
GAL.3.12	 These laws have nothing to do with faith, but, “Whoever obeys laws will live because he obeys them.”
GAL.3.13	 Christ paid the price to free us from the curse that the laws in Moses’ Teachings bring by becoming cursed instead of us. Scripture says, “Everyone who is hung on a tree is cursed.” 
GAL.3.14	 ⌊Christ paid the price⌋ so that the blessing promised to Abraham would come to all the people of the world through Jesus Christ and we would receive the promised Spirit through faith.
GAL.3.15	 Brothers and sisters, let me use an example from everyday life. No one can cancel a person’s will or add conditions to it once that will is put into effect. 
GAL.3.16	 The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. Scripture doesn’t say, “descendants,” referring to many, but “your descendant,” referring to one. That descendant is Christ. 
GAL.3.17	 This is what I mean: The laws ⌊given to Moses⌋ 430 years after God had already put his promise ⌊to Abraham⌋ into effect didn’t cancel the promise ⌊to Abraham⌋. 
GAL.3.18	 If we have to gain the inheritance by following those laws, then it no longer comes to us because of the promise. However, God freely gave the inheritance to Abraham through a promise.
GAL.3.19	 What, then, is the purpose of the laws given to Moses? They were added to identify what wrongdoing is. Moses’ laws did this until the descendant to whom the promise was given came.
GAL.3.20	 A mediator is not used when there is only one person involved, and God has acted on his own.
GAL.3.21	 Does this mean, then, that the laws given to Moses contradict God’s promises? That’s unthinkable! If those laws could give us life, then certainly we would receive God’s approval because we obeyed them. 
GAL.3.22	 But Scripture states that the whole world is controlled by the power of sin. Therefore, a promise based on faith in Jesus Christ could be given to those who believe.
GAL.3.23	 We were kept under control by Moses’ laws until this faith came. We were under their control until this faith which was about to come would be revealed.
GAL.3.24	 Before Christ came, Moses’ laws served as our guardian. Christ came so that we could receive God’s approval by faith. 
GAL.3.25	 But now that this faith has come, we are no longer under the control of a guardian. 
GAL.3.26	 You are all God’s children by believing in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.27	 Clearly, all of you who were baptized in Christ’s name have clothed yourselves with Christ. 
GAL.3.28	 There are neither Jews nor Greeks, slaves nor free people, males nor females. You are all the same in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.29	 If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants and heirs, as God promised.
GAL.4.1	 Let me explain further. As long as an heir is a child, he is no better off than a slave, even though he owns everything. 
GAL.4.2	 He is placed under the control of guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. 
GAL.4.3	 It was the same way with us. When we were children, we were slaves to the principles of this world. 
GAL.4.4	 But when the right time came, God sent his Son ⌊into the world⌋. A woman gave birth to him, and he came under the control of the laws given to Moses. 
GAL.4.5	 God sent him to pay for the freedom of those who were controlled by these laws so that we would be adopted as his children. 
GAL.4.6	 Because you are God’s children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into us to call out, “Abba! 
GAL.4.7	 So you are no longer slaves but God’s children. Since you are God’s children, God has also made you heirs.
GAL.4.8	 When you didn’t know God, you were slaves to things which are really not gods at all. 
GAL.4.9	 But now you know God, or rather, God knows you. So how can you turn back again to the powerless and bankrupt principles of this world? Why do you want to become their slaves all over again? 
GAL.4.10	 You religiously observe days, months, seasons, and years! 
GAL.4.11	 I’m afraid for you. Maybe the hard work I spent on you has been wasted.
GAL.4.12	 Brothers and sisters, I beg you to become like me. After all, I became like you were.
GAL.4.12	You didn’t do anything wrong to me. 
GAL.4.13	 You know that the first time I brought you the Good News I was ill. 
GAL.4.14	 Even though my illness was difficult for you, you didn’t despise or reject me. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were God’s messenger 
GAL.4.15	 What happened to your positive attitude? It’s a fact that if it had been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. 
GAL.4.16	 Can it be that I have become your enemy for telling you the truth?
GAL.4.17	 These people ⌊who distort the Good News⌋ are devoted to you, but not in a good way. They don’t want you to associate with me so that you will be devoted only to them. 
GAL.4.18	 (Devotion to a good cause is always good, even when I’m not with you.)
GAL.4.19	 My children, I am suffering birth pains for you again until Christ is formed in you. 
GAL.4.20	 I wish I were with you right now so that I could change the tone of my voice. I’m completely puzzled by what you’ve done!
GAL.4.21	 Those who want to be controlled by Moses’ laws should tell me something. Are you really listening to what Moses’ Teachings say? 
GAL.4.22	 Scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one by a woman who was a slave and the other by a free woman. 
GAL.4.23	 Now, the son of the slave woman was conceived in a natural way, but the son of the free woman was conceived through a promise ⌊made to Abraham⌋.
GAL.4.24	 I’m going to use these historical events as an illustration. The women illustrate two arrangements.
GAL.4.25	 Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She is like Jerusalem today because she and her children are slaves. 
GAL.4.26	 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	 Scripture says:
GAL.4.27	“Rejoice, women who cannot get pregnant,
GAL.4.27	who cannot give birth to any children!
GAL.4.27	Break into shouting, those who feel no pains of childbirth!
GAL.4.27	Because the deserted woman will have more children
GAL.4.27	than the woman who has a husband.”
GAL.4.28	 Now you, brothers and sisters, are children of the promise like Isaac.
GAL.4.29	 Furthermore, at that time the son who was conceived in a natural way persecuted the son conceived in a spiritual way. That’s exactly what’s happening now. 
GAL.4.30	 But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, because the son of the slave woman must never share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.” 
GAL.4.31	 Brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave woman but of the free woman.
GAL.5.1	 Christ has freed us so that we may enjoy the benefits of freedom. Therefore, be firm ⌊in this freedom⌋, and don’t become slaves again.
GAL.5.2	 I, Paul, can guarantee that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you. 
GAL.5.3	 Again, I insist that everyone who allows himself to be circumcised must realize that he obligates himself to do everything Moses’ Teachings demand. 
GAL.5.4	 Those of you who try to earn God’s approval by obeying his laws have been cut off from Christ. You have fallen out of God’s favor.
GAL.5.5	 However, in our spiritual nature, faith causes us to wait eagerly for the confidence that comes with God’s approval. 
GAL.5.6	 As far as our relationship to Christ Jesus is concerned, it doesn’t matter whether we are circumcised or not. But what matters is a faith that expresses itself through love.
GAL.5.7	 You were doing so well. Who stopped you from being influenced by the truth? 
GAL.5.8	 The arguments of the person who is influencing you do not come from the one who is calling you. 
GAL.5.9	 A little yeast spreads through the whole batch of dough. 
GAL.5.10	 The Lord gives me confidence that you will not disagree with this. However, the one who is confusing you will suffer God’s judgment regardless of who he is. 
GAL.5.11	 Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching that circumcision is necessary, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the cross wouldn’t be offensive anymore. 
GAL.5.12	 I wish those troublemakers would castrate themselves.
GAL.5.13	 You were indeed called to be free, brothers and sisters. Don’t turn this freedom into an excuse for your corrupt nature to express itself. Rather, serve each other through love. 
GAL.5.14	 All of Moses’ Teachings are summarized in a single statement, “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” 
GAL.5.15	 But if you criticize and attack each other, be careful that you don’t destroy each other.
GAL.5.16	 Let me explain further. Live your life as your spiritual nature directs you. Then you will never follow through on what your corrupt nature wants. 
GAL.5.17	 What your corrupt nature wants is contrary to what your spiritual nature wants, and what your spiritual nature wants is contrary to what your corrupt nature wants. They are opposed to each other. As a result, you don’t always do what you intend to do. 
GAL.5.18	 If your spiritual nature is your guide, you are not subject to Moses’ laws.
GAL.5.19	 Now, the effects of the corrupt nature are obvious: illicit sex, perversion, promiscuity, 
GAL.5.20	 idolatry, drug use, hatred, rivalry, jealousy, angry outbursts, selfish ambition, conflict, factions, 
GAL.5.21	 envy, drunkenness, wild partying, and similar things. I’ve told you in the past and I’m telling you again that people who do these kinds of things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
GAL.5.22	 But the spiritual nature produces love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
GAL.5.23	 gentleness, and self-control. There are no laws against things like that. 
GAL.5.24	 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their corrupt nature along with its passions and desires. 
GAL.5.25	 If we live by our spiritual nature, then our lives need to conform to our spiritual nature. 
GAL.5.26	 We can’t allow ourselves to act arrogantly and to provoke or envy each other.
GAL.6.1	 Brothers and sisters, if a person gets trapped by wrongdoing, those of you who are spiritual should help that person turn away from doing wrong. Do it in a gentle way. At the same time watch yourself so that you also are not tempted. 
GAL.6.2	 Help carry each other’s burdens. In this way you will follow Christ’s teachings. 
GAL.6.3	 So if any one of you thinks you’re important when you’re really not, you’re only fooling yourself. 
GAL.6.4	 Each of you must examine your own actions. Then you can be proud of your own accomplishments without comparing yourself to others. 
GAL.6.5	 Assume your own responsibility.
GAL.6.6	 The person who is taught God’s word should share all good things with his teacher. 
GAL.6.7	 Make no mistake about this: You can never make a fool out of God. Whatever you plant is what you’ll harvest. 
GAL.6.8	 If you plant in ⌊the soil of⌋ your corrupt nature, you will harvest destruction. But if you plant in ⌊the soil of⌋ your spiritual nature, you will harvest everlasting life. 
GAL.6.9	 We can’t allow ourselves to get tired of living the right way. Certainly, each of us will receive ⌊everlasting life⌋ at the proper time, if we don’t give up. 
GAL.6.10	 Whenever we have the opportunity, we have to do what is good for everyone, especially for the family of believers.
GAL.6.11	 Look at how large the letters ⌊in these words⌋ are because I’m writing this myself.
GAL.6.12	 These people who want to make a big deal out of a physical thing are trying to force you to be circumcised. Their only aim is to avoid persecution because of the cross of Christ. 
GAL.6.13	 It’s clear that not even those who had themselves circumcised did this to follow Moses’ laws. Yet, they want you to be circumcised so that they can brag about what was done to your body. 
GAL.6.14	 But it’s unthinkable that I could ever brag about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. By his cross my relationship to the world and its relationship to me have been crucified. 
GAL.6.15	 Certainly, it doesn’t matter whether a person is circumcised or not. Rather, what matters is being a new creation. 
GAL.6.16	 Peace and mercy will come to rest on all those who conform to this principle. They are the Israel of God.
GAL.6.17	 From now on, don’t make any trouble for me! After all, I carry the scars of Jesus on my body.
GAL.6.18	 May the good will 
EPH.1.1	 From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will.
EPH.1.1	To God’s holy and faithful people who are united with Christ in the city of Ephesus.
EPH.1.2	 Good will 
EPH.1.3	 Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Through Christ, God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing that heaven has to offer. 
EPH.1.4	 Before the creation of the world, he chose us through Christ to be holy and perfect in his presence. 
EPH.1.5	 Because of his love he had already decided to adopt us through Jesus Christ. He freely chose to do this 
EPH.1.6	 so that the kindness 
EPH.1.7	 Through the blood of his Son, we are set free from our sins. God forgives our failures because of his overflowing kindness. 
EPH.1.8	 He poured out his kindness by giving us every kind of wisdom and insight 
EPH.1.9	 when he revealed the mystery of his plan to us. He had decided to do this through Christ. 
EPH.1.10	 He planned to bring all of history to its goal in Christ. Then Christ would be the head of everything in heaven and on earth. 
EPH.1.11	 God also decided ahead of time to choose us through Christ according to his plan, which makes everything work the way he intends. 
EPH.1.12	 He planned all of this so that we who had already focused our hope on Christ would praise him and give him glory.
EPH.1.13	 You heard and believed the message of truth, the Good News that he has saved you. In him you were sealed with the Holy Spirit whom he promised. 
EPH.1.14	 This Holy Spirit is the guarantee that we will receive our inheritance. We have this guarantee until we are set free to belong to him. God receives praise and glory for this.
EPH.1.15	 I, too, have heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God’s people. For this reason 
EPH.1.16	 I never stop thanking God for you. I always remember you in my prayers. 
EPH.1.17	 I pray that the glorious Father, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, would give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know Christ better. 
EPH.1.18	 Then you will have deeper insight. You will know the confidence that he calls you to have and the glorious wealth that God’s people will inherit. 
EPH.1.19	 You will also know the unlimited greatness of his power as it works with might and strength for us, the believers. 
EPH.1.20	 He worked with that same power in Christ when he brought him back to life and gave him the highest position in heaven. 
EPH.1.21	 He is far above all rulers, authorities, powers, lords, and all other names that can be named, not only in this present world but also in the world to come. 
EPH.1.22	 God has put everything under the control of Christ. He has made Christ the head of everything for the good of the church. 
EPH.1.23	 The church is Christ’s body and completes him as he fills everything in every way.
EPH.2.1	 You were once dead because of your failures and sins. 
EPH.2.2	 You followed the ways of this present world and its spiritual ruler. This ruler continues to work in people who refuse to obey God. 
EPH.2.3	 All of us once lived among these people, and followed the desires of our corrupt nature. We did what our corrupt desires and thoughts wanted us to do. So, because of our nature, we deserved God’s anger just like everyone else.
EPH.2.4	 But God is rich in mercy because of his great love for us. 
EPH.2.5	 We were dead because of our failures, but he made us alive together with Christ. (It is God’s kindness 
EPH.2.6	 God has brought us back to life together with Christ Jesus and has given us a position in heaven with him. 
EPH.2.7	 He did this through Christ Jesus out of his generosity to us in order to show his extremely rich kindness in the world to come. 
EPH.2.8	 God saved you through faith as an act of kindness. You had nothing to do with it. Being saved is a gift from God. 
EPH.2.9	 It’s not the result of anything you’ve done, so no one can brag about it. 
EPH.2.10	 God has made us what we are. He has created us in Christ Jesus to live lives filled with good works that he has prepared for us to do.
EPH.2.11	 Remember that once you were not Jewish physically. Those who called themselves “the circumcised” because of what they had done to their bodies called you “the uncircumcised.” 
EPH.2.12	 Also, at that time you were without Christ. You were excluded from citizenship in Israel, and the pledges 
EPH.2.13	 But now through Christ Jesus you, who were once far away, have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 
EPH.2.14	 So he is our peace. In his body he has made Jewish and non-Jewish people one by breaking down the wall of hostility that kept them apart. 
EPH.2.15	 He brought an end to the commandments and demands found in Moses’ Teachings so that he could take Jewish and non-Jewish people and create one new humanity in himself. So he made peace. 
EPH.2.16	 He also brought them back to God in one body by his cross, on which he killed the hostility. 
EPH.2.17	 He came with the Good News of peace for you who were far away and for those who were near. 
EPH.2.18	 So Jewish and non-Jewish people can go to the Father in one Spirit.
EPH.2.19	 That is why you are no longer foreigners and outsiders but citizens together with God’s people and members of God’s family. 
EPH.2.20	 You are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Christ Jesus himself is the cornerstone. 
EPH.2.21	 In him all the parts of the building fit together and grow into a holy temple in the Lord. 
EPH.2.22	 Through him you, also, are being built in the Spirit together with others into a place where God lives.
EPH.3.1	 This is the reason I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus 
EPH.3.2	 Certainly, you have heard how God gave me the responsibility of bringing his kindness 
EPH.3.3	 You have heard that he let me know this mystery through a revelation. I’ve already written to you about this briefly. 
EPH.3.4	 When you read this, you’ll see that I understand the mystery about Christ. 
EPH.3.5	 In the past, this mystery was not known by people as it is now. The Spirit has now revealed it to his holy apostles and prophets. 
EPH.3.6	 This mystery is the Good News that people who are not Jewish have the same inheritance as Jewish people do. They belong to the same body and share the same promise that God made in Christ Jesus. 
EPH.3.7	 I became a servant of this Good News through God’s kindness freely given to me when his power worked ⌊in me⌋.
EPH.3.8	 I am the least of all God’s people. Yet, God showed me his kindness by allowing me to spread the Good News of the immeasurable wealth of Christ to people who are not Jewish. 
EPH.3.9	 He allowed me to explain the way this mystery works. God, who created all things, kept it hidden in the past. 
EPH.3.10	 He did this so that now, through the church, he could let the rulers and authorities in heaven know his infinite wisdom. 
EPH.3.11	 This was God’s plan for all of history which he carried out through Christ Jesus our Lord. 
EPH.3.12	 We can go to God with bold confidence through faith in Christ. 
EPH.3.13	 So then, I ask you not to become discouraged by the troubles I suffer for you. In fact, my troubles bring you glory.
EPH.3.14	 This is the reason I kneel in the presence of the Father 
EPH.3.15	 from whom all the family in heaven and on earth receives its name. 
EPH.3.16	 I’m asking God to give you a gift from the wealth of his glory. I pray that he would give you inner strength and power through his Spirit. 
EPH.3.17	 Then Christ will live in you through faith. I also pray that love may be the ground into which you sink your roots and on which you have your foundation. 
EPH.3.18	 This way, with all of God’s people you will be able to understand how wide, long, high, and deep his love is. 
EPH.3.19	 You will know Christ’s love, which goes far beyond any knowledge. I am praying this so that you may be completely filled with God.
EPH.3.20	 Glory belongs to God, whose power is at work in us. By this power he can do infinitely more than we can ask or imagine. 
EPH.3.21	 Glory belongs to God in the church and in Christ Jesus for all time and eternity! Amen.
EPH.4.1	 I, a prisoner in the Lord, encourage you to live the kind of life which proves that God has called you. 
EPH.4.2	 Be humble and gentle in every way. Be patient with each other and lovingly accept each other. 
EPH.4.3	 Through the peace that ties you together, do your best to maintain the unity that the Spirit gives. 
EPH.4.4	 There is one body and one Spirit. In the same way you were called to share one hope. 
EPH.4.5	 There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
EPH.4.6	 one God and Father of all, who is over everything, through everything, and in everything.
EPH.4.7	 God’s favor 
EPH.4.8	 That’s why the Scriptures say:
EPH.4.8	“When he went to the highest place,
EPH.4.8	he took captive those who had captured us
EPH.4.8	and gave gifts to people.”
EPH.4.9	 Now what does it mean that he went up except that he also had gone down to the lowest parts of the earth? 
EPH.4.10	 The one who had gone down also went up above all the heavens so that he fills everything.
EPH.4.11	 He also gave apostles, prophets, missionaries, as well as pastors and teachers as gifts ⌊to his church⌋. 
EPH.4.12	 Their purpose is to prepare God’s people to serve and to build up the body of Christ. 
EPH.4.13	 This is to continue until all of us are united in our faith and in our knowledge about God’s Son, until we become mature, until we measure up to Christ, who is the standard. 
EPH.4.14	 Then we will no longer be little children, tossed and carried about by all kinds of teachings that change like the wind. We will no longer be influenced by people who use cunning and clever strategies to lead us astray. 
EPH.4.15	 Instead, as we lovingly speak the truth, we will grow up completely in our relationship to Christ, who is the head. 
EPH.4.16	 He makes the whole body fit together and unites it through the support of every joint. As each and every part does its job, he makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.
EPH.4.17	 So I tell you and encourage you in the Lord’s name not to live any longer like other people in the world. Their minds are set on worthless things. 
EPH.4.18	 They can’t understand because they are in the dark. They are excluded from the life that God approves of because of their ignorance and stubbornness. 
EPH.4.19	 Since they no longer have any sense of shame, they have become promiscuous. They practice every kind of sexual perversion with a constant desire for more.
EPH.4.20	 But that is not what you learned from Christ’s teachings. 
EPH.4.21	 You have certainly heard his message and have been taught his ways. The truth is in Jesus. 
EPH.4.22	 You were taught to change the way you were living. The person you used to be will ruin you through desires that deceive you. 
EPH.4.23	 However, you were taught to have a new attitude. 
EPH.4.24	 You were also taught to become a new person created to be like God, truly righteous and holy.
EPH.4.25	 So then, get rid of lies. Speak the truth to each other, because we are all members of the same body.
EPH.4.26	 Be angry without sinning. Don’t go to bed angry. 
EPH.4.27	 Don’t give the devil any opportunity ⌊to work⌋.
EPH.4.28	 Thieves must quit stealing and, instead, they must work hard. They should do something good with their hands so that they’ll have something to share with those in need.
EPH.4.29	 Don’t say anything that would hurt ⌊another person⌋. Instead, speak only what is good so that you can give help wherever it is needed. That way, what you say will help those who hear you. 
EPH.4.30	 Don’t give God’s Holy Spirit any reason to be upset with you. He has put his seal on you for the day you will be set free ⌊from the world of sin⌋.
EPH.4.31	 Get rid of your bitterness, hot tempers, anger, loud quarreling, cursing, and hatred. 
EPH.4.32	 Be kind to each other, sympathetic, forgiving each other as God has forgiven you through Christ.
EPH.5.1	 Imitate God, since you are the children he loves. 
EPH.5.2	 Live in love as Christ also loved us. He gave his life for us as an offering and sacrifice, a soothing aroma to God.
EPH.5.3	 Don’t let sexual sin, perversion of any kind, or greed even be mentioned among you. This is not appropriate behavior for God’s holy people. 
EPH.5.4	 It’s not right that dirty stories, foolish talk, or obscene jokes should be mentioned among you either. Instead, give thanks ⌊to God⌋. 
EPH.5.5	 You know very well that no person who is involved in sexual sin, perversion, or greed (which means worshiping wealth) can have any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 
EPH.5.6	 Don’t let anyone deceive you with meaningless words. It is because of sins like these that God’s anger comes to those who refuse to obey him. 
EPH.5.7	 Don’t be partners with them.
EPH.5.8	 Once you lived in the dark, but now the Lord has filled you with light. Live as children who have light. 
EPH.5.9	 Light produces everything that is good, that has God’s approval, and that is true. 
EPH.5.10	 Determine which things please the Lord. 
EPH.5.11	 Have nothing to do with the useless works that darkness produces. Instead, expose them for what they are. 
EPH.5.12	 It is shameful to talk about what some people do in secret. 
EPH.5.13	 Light exposes the true character of everything 
EPH.5.14	 because light makes everything easy to see. That’s why it says:
EPH.5.14	“Wake up, sleeper!
EPH.5.14	Rise from the dead,
EPH.5.14	and Christ will shine on you.” 
EPH.5.15	 So then, be very careful how you live. Don’t live like foolish people but like wise people. 
EPH.5.16	 Make the most of your opportunities because these are evil days. 
EPH.5.17	 So don’t be foolish, but understand what the Lord wants. 
EPH.5.18	 Don’t get drunk on wine, which leads to wild living. Instead, be filled with the Spirit 
EPH.5.19	 by reciting psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs for your own good. Sing and make music to the Lord with your hearts. 
EPH.5.20	 Always thank God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.5.21	 Place yourselves under each other’s authority out of respect for Christ.
EPH.5.22	 Wives, place yourselves under your husbands’ authority as you have placed yourselves under the Lord’s authority.
EPH.5.23	 The husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. It is his body, and he is its Savior. 
EPH.5.24	 As the church is under Christ’s authority, so wives are under their husbands’ authority in everything.
EPH.5.25	 Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it. 
EPH.5.26	 He did this to make the church holy by cleansing it, washing it using water along with spoken words. 
EPH.5.27	 Then he could present it to himself as a glorious church, without any kind of stain or wrinkle—holy and without faults. 
EPH.5.28	 So husbands must love their wives as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself. 
EPH.5.29	 No one ever hated his own body. Instead, he feeds and takes care of it, as Christ takes care of the church. 
EPH.5.30	 We are parts of his body. 
EPH.5.31	 That’s why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will be one. 
EPH.5.32	 This is a great mystery. (I’m talking about Christ’s relationship to the church.) 
EPH.5.33	 But every husband must love his wife as he loves himself, and wives should respect their husbands.
EPH.6.1	 Children, obey your parents because you are Christians.
EPH.6.2	 “Honor your father and mother 
EPH.6.3	 that everything may go well for you, and you may have a long life on earth.” This is an important commandment with a promise.
EPH.6.4	 Fathers, don’t make your children bitter about life. Instead, bring them up in Christian discipline and instruction.
EPH.6.5	 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with proper respect. Be as sincere as you are when you obey Christ. 
EPH.6.6	 Don’t obey them only while you’re being watched, as if you merely wanted to please people. But obey like slaves who belong to Christ, who have a deep desire to do what God wants them to do. 
EPH.6.7	 Serve eagerly as if you were serving your heavenly master and not merely serving human masters. 
EPH.6.8	 You know that your heavenly master will reward all of us for whatever good we do, whether we’re slaves or free people.
EPH.6.9	 Masters, treat your slaves with respect. Don’t threaten a slave. You know that there is one master in heaven who has authority over both of you, and he doesn’t play favorites.
EPH.6.10	 Finally, receive your power from the Lord and from his mighty strength. 
EPH.6.11	 Put on all the armor that God supplies. In this way you can take a stand against the devil’s strategies. 
EPH.6.12	 This is not a wrestling match against a human opponent. We are wrestling with rulers, authorities, the powers who govern this world of darkness, and spiritual forces that control evil in the heavenly world. 
EPH.6.13	 For this reason, take up all the armor that God supplies. Then you will be able to take a stand during these evil days.
EPH.6.14	 So then, take your stand! Fasten truth around your waist like a belt. Put on God’s approval as your breastplate. 
EPH.6.15	 Put on your shoes so that you are ready to spread the Good News that gives peace. 
EPH.6.16	 In addition to all these, take the Christian faith as your shield. With it you can put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 
EPH.6.17	 Also take salvation as your helmet and the word of God as the sword that the Spirit supplies.
EPH.6.18	 Pray in the Spirit 
EPH.6.19	 Also pray that God will give me the right words to say. Then I will speak boldly when I reveal the mystery of the Good News. 
EPH.6.20	 Because I have already been doing this as Christ’s representative, I am in prison. So pray that I speak about this Good News as boldly as I have to.
EPH.6.21	 I’m sending Tychicus to you. He is our dear brother and a faithful deacon 
EPH.6.22	 That’s why I’m sending him to you so that you may know how we’re doing and that he may encourage you.
EPH.6.23	 May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give our brothers and sisters peace and love along with faith. 
EPH.6.24	 His favor 
PHP.1.1	 From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.
PHP.1.1	To God’s people in the city of Philippi and their bishops 
PHP.1.2	 Good will 
PHP.1.3	 I thank my God for all the memories I have of you. 
PHP.1.4	 Every time I pray for all of you, I do it with joy. 
PHP.1.5	 I can do this because of the partnership we’ve had with you in the Good News from the first day ⌊you believed⌋ until now. 
PHP.1.6	 I’m convinced that God, who began this good work in you, will carry it through to completion on the day of Christ Jesus. 
PHP.1.7	 You have a special place in my heart. So it’s right for me to think this way about all of you. All of you are my partners. Together we share God’s favor,
PHP.1.8	 God is my witness that, with all the compassion of Christ Jesus, I long ⌊to see⌋ every one of you.
PHP.1.9	 I pray that your love will keep on growing because of your knowledge and insight. 
PHP.1.10	 That way you will be able to determine what is best and be pure and blameless until the day of Christ. 
PHP.1.11	 Jesus Christ will fill your lives with everything that God’s approval produces. Your lives will then bring glory and praise to God.
PHP.1.12	 I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what happened to me has helped to spread the Good News. 
PHP.1.13	 As a result, it has become clear to all the soldiers who guard the emperor and to everyone else that I am in prison because of Christ. 
PHP.1.14	 So through my being in prison, the Lord has given most of our brothers and sisters confidence to speak God’s word more boldly and fearlessly than ever.
PHP.1.15	 Some people tell the message about Christ because of their jealousy and envy. Others tell the message about him because of their good will. 
PHP.1.16	 Those who tell the message about Christ out of love know that God has put me here to defend the Good News. 
PHP.1.17	 But the others are insincere. They tell the message about Christ out of selfish ambition in order to stir up trouble for me while I’m in prison. 
PHP.1.18	 But what does it matter? Nothing matters except that, in one way or another, people are told the message about Christ, whether with honest or dishonest motives, and I’m happy about that.
PHP.1.18	Yes, I will continue to be happy 
PHP.1.19	 for another reason. I know that I will be set free through your prayers and through the help that comes from the Spirit of Jesus Christ. 
PHP.1.20	 I eagerly expect and hope that I will have nothing to be ashamed of. I will speak very boldly and honor Christ in my body, now as always, whether I live or die. 
PHP.1.21	 Christ means everything to me in this life, and when I die I’ll have even more. 
PHP.1.22	 If I continue to live in this life, my work will produce more results. I don’t know which I would prefer. 
PHP.1.23	 I find it hard to choose between the two. I would like to leave this life and be with Christ. That’s by far the better choice. 
PHP.1.24	 But for your sake it’s better that I remain in this life. 
PHP.1.25	 Since I’m convinced of this, I know that I will continue to live and be with all of you. This will help you to grow and be joyful in your faith. 
PHP.1.26	 So by coming to you again, I want to give you even more reason to have pride in Christ Jesus with me.
PHP.1.27	 Live as citizens who reflect the Good News about Christ. Then, whether I come to see you or whether I stay away, I’ll hear all about you. I’ll hear that you are firmly united in spirit, united in fighting for the faith that the Good News brings. 
PHP.1.28	 So don’t let your opponents intimidate you in any way. This is God’s way of showing them that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved. 
PHP.1.29	 God has given you the privilege not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for him. 
PHP.1.30	 You are involved in the same struggle that you saw me having. Now you hear that I’m still involved in it.
PHP.2.1	 So then, as Christians, do you have any encouragement? Do you have any comfort from love? Do you have any spiritual relationships? Do you have any sympathy and compassion? 
PHP.2.2	 Then fill me with joy by having the same attitude and the same love, living in harmony, and keeping one purpose in mind. 
PHP.2.3	 Don’t act out of selfish ambition or be conceited. Instead, humbly think of others as being better than yourselves. 
PHP.2.4	 Don’t be concerned only about your own interests, but also be concerned about the interests of others. 
PHP.2.5	 Have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.
PHP.2.6	 Although he was in the form of God and equal with God,
PHP.2.6	he did not take advantage of this equality.
PHP.2.7	 Instead, he emptied himself by taking on the form of a servant,
PHP.2.7	by becoming like other humans,
PHP.2.7	by having a human appearance.
PHP.2.8	 He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death,
PHP.2.8	death on a cross.
PHP.2.9	 This is why God has given him an exceptional honor—
PHP.2.9	the name honored above all other names—
PHP.2.10	 so that at the name of Jesus everyone in heaven, on earth,
PHP.2.10	and in the world below will kneel
PHP.2.11	 and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
PHP.2.11	to the glory of God the Father.
PHP.2.12	 My dear friends, you have always obeyed, not only when I was with you but even more now that I’m absent. In the same way continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling. 
PHP.2.13	 It is God who produces in you the desires and actions that please him.
PHP.2.14	 Do everything without complaining or arguing. 
PHP.2.15	 Then you will be blameless and innocent. You will be God’s children without any faults among people who are crooked and corrupt. You will shine like stars among them in the world 
PHP.2.16	 as you hold firmly to the word of life. Then I can brag on the day of Christ that my effort was not wasted and that my work produced results. 
PHP.2.17	 My life is being poured out as a part of the sacrifice and service ⌊I offer to God⌋ for your faith. Yet, I am filled with joy, and I share that joy with all of you. 
PHP.2.18	 For this same reason you also should be filled with joy and share that joy with me.
PHP.2.19	 I hope that the Lord Jesus will allow me to send Timothy to you soon so that I can receive some encouraging news about you. 
PHP.2.20	 I don’t have anyone else like Timothy. He takes a genuine interest in your welfare. 
PHP.2.21	 Everyone else looks after his own interests, not after those of Jesus Christ. 
PHP.2.22	 But you know what kind of person Timothy proved to be. Like a father and son we worked hard together to spread the Good News. 
PHP.2.23	 I hope to send him as soon as I see how things are going to turn out for me. 
PHP.2.24	 But the Lord gives me confidence that I will come ⌊to visit you⌋ soon.
PHP.2.25	 I feel that I must send Epaphroditus—my brother, coworker, and fellow soldier—back to you. You sent him as your personal representative to help me in my need. 
PHP.2.26	 He has been longing to see all of you and is troubled because you heard that he was sick. 
PHP.2.27	 Indeed, he was so sick that he almost died. But God had mercy not only on him but also on me and kept me from having one sorrow on top of another. 
PHP.2.28	 So I’m especially eager to send him to you. In this way you will have the joy of seeing him again and I will feel relieved. 
PHP.2.29	 Give him a joyful Christian welcome. Make sure you honor people like Epaphroditus highly. 
PHP.2.30	 He risked his life and almost died for the work of Christ in order to make up for the help you couldn’t give me.
PHP.3.1	 Now then, brothers and sisters, be joyful in the Lord. It’s no trouble for me to write the same things to you, and it’s for your safety. 
PHP.3.2	 Beware of dogs! Beware of those who do evil things. Beware of those who insist on circumcision. 
PHP.3.3	 We are the ⌊true⌋ circumcised people ⌊of God⌋ because we serve God’s Spirit and take pride in Christ Jesus. We don’t place any confidence in physical things, 
PHP.3.4	 although I could have confidence in my physical qualifications. If anyone else thinks that he can trust in something physical, I can claim even more. 
PHP.3.5	 I was circumcised on the eighth day. I’m a descendant of Israel. I’m from the tribe of Benjamin. I’m a pure-blooded Hebrew. When it comes to following Jewish laws, I was a Pharisee. 
PHP.3.6	 When it comes to being enthusiastic, I was a persecutor of the church. When it comes to winning God’s approval by obeying Jewish laws, I was perfect.
PHP.3.7	 These things that I once considered valuable, I now consider worthless for Christ. 
PHP.3.8	 It’s far more than that! I consider everything else worthless because I’m much better off knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. It’s because of him that I think of everything as worthless. I threw it all away in order to gain Christ 
PHP.3.9	 and to have a relationship with him. This means that I didn’t receive God’s approval by obeying his laws. The opposite is true! I have God’s approval through faith in Christ. This is the approval that comes from God and is based on faith 
PHP.3.10	 that knows Christ. Faith knows the power that his coming back to life gives and what it means to share his suffering. In this way I’m becoming like him in his death, 
PHP.3.11	 with the confidence that I’ll come back to life from the dead.
PHP.3.12	 It’s not that I’ve already reached the goal or have already completed the course. But I run to win that which Jesus Christ has already won for me. 
PHP.3.13	 Brothers and sisters, I can’t consider myself a winner yet. This is what I do: I don’t look back, I lengthen my stride, and 
PHP.3.14	 I run straight toward the goal to win the prize that God’s heavenly call offers in Christ Jesus.
PHP.3.15	 Whoever has a mature faith should think this way. And if you think differently, God will show you how to think. 
PHP.3.16	 However, we should be guided by what we have learned so far.
PHP.3.17	 Brothers and sisters, imitate me, and pay attention to those who live by the example we have given you. 
PHP.3.18	 I have often told you, and now tell you with tears in my eyes, that many live as the enemies of the cross of Christ. 
PHP.3.19	 In the end they will be destroyed. Their own emotions are their god, and they take pride in the shameful things they do. Their minds are set on worldly things. 
PHP.3.20	 We, however, are citizens of heaven. We look forward to the Lord Jesus Christ coming from heaven as our Savior. 
PHP.3.21	 Through his power to bring everything under his authority, he will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorified body.
PHP.4.1	 So, brothers and sisters, I love you and miss you. You are my joy and my crown. Therefore, dear friends, keep your relationship with the Lord firm!
PHP.4.2	 I encourage both Euodia and Syntyche to have the attitude the Lord wants them to have. 
PHP.4.3	 Yes, I also ask you, Syzugus, my true partner, to help these women. They fought beside me to spread the Good News along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers, whose names are in the Book of Life.
PHP.4.4	 Always be joyful in the Lord! I’ll say it again: Be joyful! 
PHP.4.5	 Let everyone know how considerate you are. The Lord is near. 
PHP.4.6	 Never worry about anything. But in every situation let God know what you need in prayers and requests while giving thanks. 
PHP.4.7	 Then God’s peace, which goes beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your thoughts and emotions through Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.8	 Finally, brothers and sisters, keep your thoughts on whatever is right or deserves praise: things that are true, honorable, fair, pure, acceptable, or commendable. 
PHP.4.9	 Practice what you’ve learned and received from me, what you heard and saw me do. Then the God who gives this peace will be with you.
PHP.4.10	 The Lord has filled me with joy because you again showed interest in me. You were interested but did not have an opportunity to show it. 
PHP.4.11	 I’m not saying this because I’m in any need. I’ve learned to be content in whatever situation I’m in. 
PHP.4.12	 I know how to live in poverty or prosperity. No matter what the situation, I’ve learned the secret of how to live when I’m full or when I’m hungry, when I have too much or when I have too little. 
PHP.4.13	 I can do everything through Christ who strengthens me. 
PHP.4.14	 Nevertheless, it was kind of you to share my troubles.
PHP.4.15	 You Philippians also know that in the early days, when I left the province of Macedonia to spread the Good News, you were the only church to share your money with me. You gave me what I needed, and you received what I gave you. 
PHP.4.16	 Even while I was in Thessalonica, you provided for my needs twice. 
PHP.4.17	 It’s not that I’m looking for a gift. The opposite is true. I’m looking for your resources to increase. 
PHP.4.18	 You have paid me in full, and I have more than enough. Now that Epaphroditus has brought me your gifts, you have filled my needs. Your gifts are a soothing aroma, a sacrifice that God accepts and with which he is pleased. 
PHP.4.19	 My God will richly fill your every need in a glorious way through Christ Jesus. 
PHP.4.20	 Glory belongs to our God and Father forever! Amen.
PHP.4.21	 Greet everyone who believes in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings to you. 
PHP.4.22	 All God’s people here, especially those in the emperor’s palace, greet you. 
PHP.4.23	 May the good will 
COL.1.1	 From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will, and from our brother Timothy.
COL.1.2	 To God’s holy and faithful people, our brothers and sisters who are united with Christ in the city of Colossae.
COL.1.2	Good will 
COL.1.3	 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in our prayers for you. 
COL.1.4	 We thank God because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all of God’s people. 
COL.1.5	 You have these because of the hope which is kept safe for you in heaven. Some time ago you heard about this hope in the Good News which is the message of truth. 
COL.1.6	 This Good News is present with you now. It is producing results and spreading all over the world as it did among you from the first day you heard it. At that time you came to know what God’s kindness 
COL.1.7	 You learned about this Good News from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant. He is taking your place here as a trustworthy deacon 
COL.1.8	 and has told us about the love that the Spirit has given you.
COL.1.9	 For this reason we have not stopped praying for you since the day we heard about you. We ask ⌊God⌋ to fill you with the knowledge of his will through every kind of spiritual wisdom and insight. 
COL.1.10	 We ask this so that you will live the kind of lives that prove you belong to the Lord. Then you will want to please him in every way as you grow in producing every kind of good work by this knowledge about God. 
COL.1.11	 We ask him to strengthen you by his glorious might with all the power you need to patiently endure everything with joy. 
COL.1.12	 You will also thank the Father, who has made you able to share the light, which is what God’s people inherit.
COL.1.13	 God has rescued us from the power of darkness and has brought us into the kingdom of his Son, whom he loves. 
COL.1.14	 His Son paid the price to free us, which means that our sins are forgiven.
COL.1.15	 He is the image of the invisible God,
COL.1.15	the firstborn of all creation.
COL.1.16	 He created all things in heaven and on earth,
COL.1.16	visible and invisible.
COL.1.16	Whether they are kings or lords,
COL.1.16	rulers or powers—
COL.1.16	everything has been created through him and for him.
COL.1.17	 He existed before everything
COL.1.17	and holds everything together.
COL.1.18	 He is also the head of the church, which is his body.
COL.1.18	He is the beginning,
COL.1.18	the first to come back to life
COL.1.18	so that he would have first place in everything.
COL.1.19	 God was pleased to have all of himself live in Christ. 
COL.1.20	 God was also pleased to bring everything on earth and in heaven back to himself through Christ. He did this by making peace through Christ’s blood sacrificed on the cross.
COL.1.21	 Once you were separated from God. The evil things you did showed your hostile attitude. 
COL.1.22	 But now Christ has brought you back to God by dying in his physical body. He did this so that you could come into God’s presence without sin, fault, or blame. 
COL.1.23	 This is on the condition that you continue in faith without being moved from the solid foundation of the hope that the Good News contains. You’ve heard this Good News of which I, Paul, became a servant. It has been spread throughout all creation under heaven.
COL.1.24	 I am happy to suffer for you now. In my body I am completing whatever remains of Christ’s sufferings. I am doing this on behalf of his body, the church. 
COL.1.25	 I became a servant of the church when God gave me the work of telling you his entire message. 
COL.1.26	 In the past God hid this mystery, but now he has revealed it to his people. 
COL.1.27	 God wanted his people throughout the world to know the glorious riches of this mystery—which is Christ living in you, giving you the hope of glory.
COL.1.28	 We spread the message about Christ as we instruct and teach everyone with all the wisdom there is. We want to present everyone as mature Christian people. 
COL.1.29	 I work hard and struggle to do this while his mighty power works in me.
COL.2.1	 I want you to know how hard I work for you, for the people of Laodicea, and for people I have never met. 
COL.2.2	 Because they are united in love, I work so that they may be encouraged by all the riches that come from a complete understanding of Christ. He is the mystery of God. 
COL.2.3	 God has hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in Christ. 
COL.2.4	 I say this so that no one will mislead you with arguments that merely sound good. 
COL.2.5	 Although I’m absent from you physically, I’m with you in spirit. I’m happy to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.
COL.2.6	 You received Christ Jesus the Lord, so continue to live as Christ’s people. 
COL.2.7	 Sink your roots in him and build on him. Be strengthened by the faith that you were taught, and overflow with thanksgiving.
COL.2.8	 Be careful not to let anyone rob you ⌊of this faith⌋ through a shallow and misleading philosophy. Such a person follows human traditions and the world’s way of doing things rather than following Christ.
COL.2.9	 All of God lives in Christ’s body, 
COL.2.10	 and God has made you complete in Christ. Christ is in charge of every ruler and authority. 
COL.2.11	 In him you were also circumcised. It was not a circumcision performed by human hands. But it was a removal of the corrupt nature in the circumcision performed by Christ. 
COL.2.12	 This happened when you were placed in the tomb with Christ through baptism. In baptism you were also brought back to life with Christ through faith in the power of God,
COL.2.13	 You were once dead because of your failures and your uncircumcised corrupt nature. But God made you alive with Christ when he forgave all our failures. 
COL.2.14	 He did this by erasing the charges that were brought against us by the written laws God had established. He took the charges away by nailing them to the cross. 
COL.2.15	 He stripped the rulers and authorities ⌊of their power⌋ and made a public spectacle of them as he celebrated his victory in Christ.
COL.2.16	 Therefore, let no one judge you because of what you eat or drink or about the observance of annual holy days, New Moon Festivals, or weekly worship days. 
COL.2.17	 These are a shadow of the things to come, but the body ⌊that casts the shadow⌋ belongs to Christ.
COL.2.18	 Let no one who delights in ⌊false⌋ humility and the worship of angels tell you that you don’t deserve a prize. Such a person, whose sinful mind fills him with arrogance, gives endless details of the visions he has seen. 
COL.2.19	 He doesn’t hold on to ⌊Christ,⌋ the head. Christ makes the whole body grow as God wants it to, through support and unity given by the joints and ligaments.
COL.2.20	 If you have died with Christ to the world’s way of doing things, why do you let others tell you how to live? It’s as though you were still under the world’s influence. 
COL.2.21	 People will tell you, “Don’t handle this! Don’t taste or touch that!” 
COL.2.22	 All of these things deal with objects that are only used up anyway. 
COL.2.23	 These things look like wisdom with their self-imposed worship, ⌊false⌋ humility, and harsh treatment of the body. But they have no value for holding back the constant desires of your corrupt nature.
COL.3.1	 Since you were brought back to life with Christ, focus on the things that are above—where Christ holds the highest position. 
COL.3.2	 Keep your mind on things above, not on worldly things. 
COL.3.3	 You have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	 Christ is your life. When he appears, then you, too, will appear with him in glory.
COL.3.5	 Therefore, put to death whatever is worldly in you: your sexual sin, perversion, passion, lust, and greed (which is the same thing as worshiping wealth). 
COL.3.6	 It is because of these sins that God’s anger comes on those who refuse to obey him.
COL.3.7	 You used to live that kind of sinful life. 
COL.3.8	 Also get rid of your anger, hot tempers, hatred, cursing, obscene language, and all similar sins. 
COL.3.9	 Don’t lie to each other. You’ve gotten rid of the person you used to be and the life you used to live, 
COL.3.10	 and you’ve become a new person. This new person is continually renewed in knowledge to be like its Creator. 
COL.3.11	 Where this happens, there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, uncivilized person, slave, or free person. Instead, Christ is everything and in everything.
COL.3.12	 As holy people whom God has chosen and loved, be sympathetic, kind, humble, gentle, and patient. 
COL.3.13	 Put up with each other, and forgive each other if anyone has a complaint. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. 
COL.3.14	 Above all, be loving. This ties everything together perfectly. 
COL.3.15	 Also, let Christ’s peace control you. God has called you into this peace by bringing you into one body. Be thankful. 
COL.3.16	 Let Christ’s word with all its wisdom and richness live in you. Use psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to teach and instruct yourselves about ⌊God’s⌋ kindness.
COL.3.17	 Everything you say or do should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
COL.3.18	 Wives, place yourselves under your husbands’ authority.
COL.3.19	 Husbands, love your wives, and don’t be harsh with them.
COL.3.20	 Children, always obey your parents. This is pleasing to the Lord. 
COL.3.21	 Fathers, don’t make your children resentful, or they will become discouraged.
COL.3.22	 Slaves, always obey your earthly masters. Don’t obey them only while you’re being watched, as if you merely wanted to please people. Be sincere in your motives out of respect for your real master. 
COL.3.23	 Whatever you do, do it wholeheartedly as though you were working for your real master and not merely for humans. 
COL.3.24	 You know that your real master will give you an inheritance as your reward. It is Christ, your real master, whom you are serving. 
COL.3.25	 The person who does wrong will be paid back for the wrong he has done. God does not play favorites.
COL.4.1	 Masters, be just and fair to your slaves because you know that you also have a master in heaven.
COL.4.2	 Keep praying. Pay attention when you offer prayers of thanksgiving. 
COL.4.3	 At the same time also pray for us. Pray that God will give us an opportunity to speak the word so that we may tell the mystery about Christ. It is because of this mystery that I am a prisoner. 
COL.4.4	 Pray that I may make this mystery as clear as possible. This is what I have to do.
COL.4.5	 Be wise in the way you act toward those who are outside ⌊the Christian faith⌋. Make the most of your opportunities.
COL.4.6	 Everything you say should be kind and well thought out so that you know how to answer everyone.
COL.4.7	 I’m sending Tychicus to you. He is our dear brother, trustworthy deacon,
COL.4.8	 I’m sending him to you so that you may know how we are doing and so that he may encourage you. 
COL.4.9	 I’m sending Onesimus with him. Onesimus is from your city and is our faithful and dear brother. They will tell you about everything that’s happening here.
COL.4.10	 Aristarchus, who is a prisoner like me, sends greetings. So does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. You have received instructions about Mark. If he comes to you, welcome him. 
COL.4.11	 Jesus, called Justus, also greets you. They are the only converts from the Jewish religion who are working with me for God’s kingdom. They have provided me with comfort. 
COL.4.12	 Epaphras, a servant of Christ Jesus from your city, greets you. He always prays intensely for you. He prays that you will continue to be mature and completely convinced of everything that God wants. 
COL.4.13	 I assure you that he works hard for you and the people in Laodicea and Hierapolis. 
COL.4.14	 My dear friend Luke, the physician, and Demas greet you. 
COL.4.15	 Greet our brothers and sisters in Laodicea, especially Nympha and the church that meets in her house.
COL.4.16	 After you have read this letter, read it in the church at Laodicea. Make sure that you also read the letter from Laodicea.
COL.4.17	 Tell Archippus to complete all the work that he started as the Lord’s servant.
COL.4.18	 I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand. Remember that I’m a prisoner. God’s good will 
1TH.1.1	 From Paul, Silas, and Timothy.
1TH.1.1	To the church at Thessalonica united with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.1.1	Good will 
1TH.1.2	 We always thank God for all of you as we remember you in our prayers. 
1TH.1.3	 In the presence of our God and Father, we never forget that your faith is active, your love is working hard, and your confidence in our Lord Jesus Christ is enduring. 
1TH.1.4	 Brothers and sisters, we never forget this because we know that God loves you and has chosen you. 
1TH.1.5	 We know this because the Good News we brought came to you not only with words but also with power, with the Holy Spirit, and with complete certainty. In the same way you know what kind of people we were while we were with you and the good things we did for you.
1TH.1.6	 You imitated us and the Lord. In spite of a lot of suffering, you welcomed God’s word with the kind of joy that the Holy Spirit gives. 
1TH.1.7	 This way, you became a model for all the believers in the province of Macedonia and Greece. 
1TH.1.8	 From you the Lord’s word has spread out not only through the province of Macedonia and Greece but also to people everywhere who have heard about your faith in God. We don’t need to say a thing about it. 
1TH.1.9	 They talk about how you welcomed us when we arrived. They even report how you turned away from false gods to serve the real, living God 
1TH.1.10	 and to wait for his Son to come from heaven. His Son is Jesus, whom he brought back to life. Jesus is the one who rescues us from ⌊God’s⌋ coming anger.
1TH.2.1	 You know, brothers and sisters, that our time with you was not wasted. 
1TH.2.2	 As you know, we suffered rough and insulting treatment in Philippi. But our God gave us the courage to tell you his Good News in spite of strong opposition.
1TH.2.3	 When we encouraged you, we didn’t use unethical schemes, corrupt practices, or deception. 
1TH.2.4	 Rather, we are always spreading the Good News. God trusts us to do this because we passed his test. We don’t try to please people but God, who tests our motives. 
1TH.2.5	 As you know, we never used flattery or schemes to make money. God is our witness! 
1TH.2.6	 We didn’t seek praise from people, from you or from anyone else, 
1TH.2.7	 although as apostles of Christ we had the right to do this.
1TH.2.7	Instead, we were gentle when we were with you, like a mother taking care of her children. 
1TH.2.8	 We felt so strongly about you that we were determined to share with you not only the Good News of God but also our lives. That’s how dear you were to us! 
1TH.2.9	 You remember, brothers and sisters, our work and what we did to earn a living. We worked night and day so that we could bring you the Good News of God without being a burden to any of you. 
1TH.2.10	 You and God are witnesses of how pure, honest, and blameless we were in our dealings with you believers. 
1TH.2.11	 You know very well that we treated each of you the way a father treats his children. We comforted you and encouraged you. Yet, we insisted that 
1TH.2.12	 you should live in a way that proves you belong to the God who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.13	 Here is another reason why we never stop thanking God: When you received God’s word from us, you realized it wasn’t the word of humans. Instead, you accepted it for what it really is—the word of God. This word is at work in you believers.
1TH.2.14	 You, brothers and sisters, were like the churches of God in Judea that are united with Christ Jesus. You suffered the same persecutions from the people of your own country as those churches did from the Jews 
1TH.2.15	 who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and who have persecuted us severely. They are displeasing to God. They are enemies of the whole human race 
1TH.2.16	 because they try to keep us from telling people who are not Jewish how they can be saved. The result is that those Jews always commit as many sins as possible. So at last they are receiving ⌊God’s⌋ anger.
1TH.2.17	 Brothers and sisters, we have been separated from you for a little while. Although we may not be able to see you, you’re always in our thoughts. We have made every possible effort to fulfill our desire to see you. 
1TH.2.18	 We wanted to visit you. I, Paul, wanted to visit you twice already, but Satan made that impossible.
1TH.2.19	 Who is our hope, joy, or prize that we can brag about in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Isn’t it you? 
1TH.2.20	 You are our glory and joy!
1TH.3.1	 We thought it best to remain in Athens by ourselves. But, because we couldn’t wait any longer ⌊for news about you⌋, 
1TH.3.2	 we sent our brother Timothy to you. He serves God by spreading the Good News about Christ. His mission was to strengthen and encourage you in your faith 
1TH.3.3	 so that these troubles don’t disturb any of you. You know that we’re destined to suffer persecution. 
1TH.3.4	 In fact, when we were with you, we told you ahead of time that we were going to suffer persecution. And as you know, that’s what happened. 
1TH.3.5	 But when I couldn’t wait any longer, I sent ⌊Timothy⌋ to find out about your faith. I wanted to see whether the tempter had in some way tempted you, making our work meaningless.
1TH.3.6	 But Timothy has just now come back to us from you and has told us the good news about your faith and love. He also told us that you always have fond memories of us and want to see us, as we want to see you. 
1TH.3.7	 So brothers and sisters, your faith has encouraged us in all our distress and trouble. 
1TH.3.8	 Now we can go on living as long as you keep your relationship with the Lord firm.
1TH.3.9	 We can never thank God enough for all the joy you give us as we rejoice in God’s presence. 
1TH.3.10	 We pray very hard night and day that we may see you again so that we can supply whatever you still need for your faith. 
1TH.3.11	 We pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus will guide us to you. 
1TH.3.12	 We also pray that the Lord will greatly increase your love for each other and for everyone else, just as we love you. 
1TH.3.13	 Then he will strengthen you to be holy. Then you will be blameless in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all God’s holy people.
1TH.4.1	 Now then, brothers and sisters, because of the Lord Jesus we ask and encourage you to excel in living a God-pleasing life even more than you already do. Do this the way we taught you. 
1TH.4.2	 You know what orders we gave you through the Lord Jesus. 
1TH.4.3	 It is God’s will that you keep away from sexual sin as a mark of your devotion to him. 
1TH.4.4	 Each of you should know that finding a husband or wife for yourself is to be done in a holy and honorable way, 
1TH.4.5	 not in the passionate, lustful way of people who don’t know God. 
1TH.4.6	 No one should take advantage of or exploit other believers that way. The Lord is the one who punishes people for all these things. We’ve already told you and warned you about this. 
1TH.4.7	 God didn’t call us to be sexually immoral but to be holy. 
1TH.4.8	 Therefore, whoever rejects this ⌊order⌋ is not rejecting human authority but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit.
1TH.4.9	 You don’t need anyone to write to you about the way Christians should love each other. God has taught you to love each other. 
1TH.4.10	 In fact, you are showing love to all the Christians throughout the province of Macedonia. We encourage you as believers to excel in love even more. 
1TH.4.11	 Also, make it your goal to live quietly, do your work, and earn your own living, as we ordered you. 
1TH.4.12	 Then your way of life will win respect from those outside ⌊the church⌋, and you won’t have to depend on anyone else for what you need.
1TH.4.13	 Brothers and sisters, we don’t want you to be ignorant about those who have died. We don’t want you to grieve like other people who have no hope. 
1TH.4.14	 We believe that Jesus died and came back to life. We also believe that, through Jesus, God will bring back those who have died. They will come back with Jesus. 
1TH.4.15	 We are telling you what the Lord taught. We who are still alive when the Lord comes will not go ⌊into his kingdom⌋ ahead of those who have already died. 
1TH.4.16	 The Lord will come from heaven with a command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet ⌊call⌋ of God. First, the dead who believed in Christ will come back to life. 
1TH.4.17	 Then, together with them, we who are still alive will be taken in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. In this way we will always be with the Lord. 
1TH.4.18	 So then, comfort each other with these words!
1TH.5.1	 Brothers and sisters, you don’t need anyone to write to you about times and dates. 
1TH.5.2	 You know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 
1TH.5.3	 When people say, “Everything is safe and sound!” destruction will suddenly strike them. It will be as sudden as labor pains come to a pregnant woman. They won’t be able to escape. 
1TH.5.4	 But, brothers and sisters, you don’t live in the dark. That day won’t take you by surprise as a thief would. 
1TH.5.5	 You belong to the day and the light not to the night and the dark. 
1TH.5.6	 Therefore, we must not fall asleep like other people, but we must stay awake and be sober. 
1TH.5.7	 People who sleep, sleep at night; people who get drunk, get drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	 Since we belong to the day, we must be sober. We must put on faith and love as a breastplate and the hope of salvation as a helmet. 
1TH.5.9	 It was not God’s intention that we experience his anger but that we obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.5.10	 He died for us so that, whether we are awake in this life or asleep in death, we will live together with him. 
1TH.5.11	 Therefore, encourage each other and strengthen one another as you are doing.
1TH.5.12	 Brothers and sisters, we ask you to show your appreciation for those leaders who work among you and instruct you. 
1TH.5.13	 We ask you to love them and think very highly of them because of the work they are doing. Live in peace with each other.
1TH.5.14	 We encourage you, brothers and sisters, to instruct those who are not living right, cheer up those who are discouraged, help the weak, and be patient with everyone. 
1TH.5.15	 Make sure that no one ever pays back one wrong with another wrong. Instead, always try to do what is good for each other and everyone else.
1TH.5.16	 Always be joyful. 
1TH.5.17	 Never stop praying. 
1TH.5.18	 Whatever happens, give thanks, because it is God’s will in Christ Jesus that you do this.
1TH.5.19	 Don’t put out the Spirit’s fire. 
1TH.5.20	 Don’t despise what God has revealed. 
1TH.5.21	 Instead, test everything. Hold on to what is good. 
1TH.5.22	 Keep away from every kind of evil.
1TH.5.23	 May the God who gives peace make you holy in every way. May he keep your whole being—spirit, soul, and body—blameless when our Lord Jesus Christ comes. 
1TH.5.24	 The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do this.
1TH.5.25	 Brothers and sisters, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	 Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.
1TH.5.27	 In the Lord’s name, I order you to read this letter to all the brothers and sisters.
1TH.5.28	 The good will 
2TH.1.1	 From Paul, Silas, and Timothy.
2TH.1.1	To the church at Thessalonica united with God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.2	 Good will 
2TH.1.3	 We always have to thank God for you, brothers and sisters. It’s right to do this because your faith is showing remarkable growth and your love for each other is increasing. 
2TH.1.4	 That’s why we brag in God’s churches about your endurance and faith in all the persecutions and suffering you are experiencing. 
2TH.1.5	 Your suffering proves that God’s judgment is right and that you are considered worthy of his kingdom.
2TH.1.6	 Certainly, it is right for God to give suffering to those who cause you to suffer. 
2TH.1.7	 It is also right for God to give all of us relief from our suffering. He will do this when the Lord Jesus is revealed, ⌊coming⌋ from heaven with his mighty angels in a blazing fire. 
2TH.1.8	 He will take revenge on those who refuse to acknowledge God and on those who refuse to respond to the Good News about our Lord Jesus. 
2TH.1.9	 They will pay the penalty by being destroyed forever, by being separated from the Lord’s presence and from his glorious power. 
2TH.1.10	 ⌊This will happen⌋ on that day when he comes to be honored among all his holy people and admired by all who have believed in him. This includes you because you believed the testimony we gave you.
2TH.1.11	 With this in mind, we always pray that our God will make you worthy of his call. We also pray that through ⌊his⌋ power he will help you accomplish every good desire and help you do everything your faith produces. 
2TH.1.12	 That way the name of our Lord Jesus will be honored among you. Then, because of the good will of Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, you will be honored by him.
2TH.2.1	 Brothers and sisters, we have this request to make of you about our Lord Jesus Christ’s coming and our gathering to meet him. 
2TH.2.2	 Don’t get upset right away or alarmed when someone claims that we said through some spirit, conversation, or letter that the day of the Lord has already come. 
2TH.2.3	 Don’t let anyone deceive you about this in any way. ⌊That day cannot come unless⌋ a revolt takes place first, and the man of sin, the man of destruction, is revealed. 
2TH.2.4	 He opposes every so-called god or anything that is worshiped and places himself above them, sitting in God’s temple and claiming to be God.
2TH.2.5	 Don’t you remember that I told you about these things when I was still with you? 
2TH.2.6	 You know what it is that now holds him back, so that he will be revealed when his time comes. 
2TH.2.7	 The mystery of this sin is already at work. But it cannot work effectively until the person now holding it back gets out of the way. 
2TH.2.8	 Then the man of sin will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will destroy him by what he says. When the Lord Jesus comes, his appearance will put an end to this man.
2TH.2.9	 The man of sin will come with the power of Satan. He will use every kind of power, including miraculous and wonderful signs. But they will be lies. 
2TH.2.10	 He will use everything that God disapproves of to deceive those who are dying, those who refused to love the truth that would save them. 
2TH.2.11	 That’s why God will send them a powerful delusion so that they will believe a lie. 
2TH.2.12	 Then everyone who did not believe the truth, but was delighted with what God disapproves of, will be condemned.
2TH.2.13	 We always have to thank God for you, brothers and sisters. You are loved by the Lord and we thank God that in the beginning he chose you to be saved through a life of spiritual devotion and faith in the truth. 
2TH.2.14	 With this in mind he called you by the Good News which we told you so that you would obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.15	 Then, brothers and sisters, firmly hold on to the traditions we taught you either when we spoke to you or in our letter.
2TH.2.16	 God our Father loved us and by his kindness 
2TH.2.17	 may he encourage and strengthen you to do and say everything that is good.
2TH.3.1	 Finally, brothers and sisters, pray that we spread the Lord’s word rapidly and that it will be honored the way it was among you. 
2TH.3.2	 Also pray that we may be rescued from worthless and evil people, since not everyone shares our faith. 
2TH.3.3	 But the Lord is faithful and will strengthen you and protect you against the evil one.
2TH.3.4	 The Lord gives us confidence that you are doing and will continue to do what we ordered you to do. 
2TH.3.5	 May the Lord direct your lives as you show God’s love and Christ’s endurance.
2TH.3.6	 Brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we order you not to associate with any believer who doesn’t live a disciplined life and doesn’t follow the tradition you received from us. 
2TH.3.7	 You know what you must do to imitate us. We lived a disciplined life among you. 
2TH.3.8	 We didn’t eat anyone’s food without paying for it. Instead, we worked hard and struggled night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you. 
2TH.3.9	 It’s not as though we didn’t have a right to receive support. Rather, we wanted to set an example for you to follow. 
2TH.3.10	 While we were with you, we gave you the order: “Whoever doesn’t want to work shouldn’t be allowed to eat.”
2TH.3.11	 We hear that some of you are not living disciplined lives. You’re not working, so you go around interfering in other people’s lives. 
2TH.3.12	 We order and encourage such people by the Lord Jesus Christ to pay attention to their own work so they can support themselves. 
2TH.3.13	 Brothers and sisters, we can’t allow ourselves to get tired of doing what is right.
2TH.3.14	 It may be that some people will not listen to what we say in this letter. Take note of them and don’t associate with them so that they will feel ashamed. 
2TH.3.15	 Yet, don’t treat them like enemies, but instruct them like brothers and sisters.
2TH.3.16	 May the Lord of peace give you his peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
2TH.3.17	 I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand. In every letter that I send, this is proof that I wrote it.
2TH.3.18	 The good will 
1TI.1.1	 From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our confidence.
1TI.1.2	 To Timothy, a genuine child in faith.
1TI.1.2	Good will,
1TI.1.3	 When I was going to the province of Macedonia, I encouraged you to stay in the city of Ephesus. That way you could order certain people to stop teaching false doctrine 
1TI.1.4	 and occupying themselves with myths and endless genealogies. These myths and genealogies raise a lot of questions rather than promoting God’s plan, which centers in faith.
1TI.1.5	 My goal in giving you this order is for love to flow from a pure heart, from a clear conscience, and from a sincere faith. 
1TI.1.6	 Some people have left these qualities behind and have turned to useless discussions. 
1TI.1.7	 They want to be experts in Moses’ Teachings. However, they don’t understand what they’re talking about or the things about which they speak so confidently.
1TI.1.8	 We know that the laws in Moses’ Teachings are good if they are used as they were intended to be used. 
1TI.1.9	 For example, a person must realize that those laws are not intended for people who have God’s approval. Laws are intended for lawbreakers and rebels, for ungodly people and sinners, for those who think nothing is holy or sacred, for those who kill their fathers, their mothers, or other people. 
1TI.1.10	 Laws are intended for people involved in sexual sins, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for those who lie when they take an oath, and for whatever else is against accurate teachings. 
1TI.1.11	 Moses’ Teachings were intended to be used in agreement with the Good News that contains the glory of the blessed God. I was entrusted with that Good News.
1TI.1.12	 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord that he has trusted me and has appointed me to do his work with the strength he has given me. 
1TI.1.13	 In the past I cursed him, persecuted him, and acted arrogantly toward him. However, I was treated with mercy because I acted ignorantly in my unbelief. 
1TI.1.14	 Our Lord was very kind 
1TI.1.15	 This is a statement that can be trusted and deserves complete acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, and I am the foremost sinner. 
1TI.1.16	 However, I was treated with mercy so that Christ Jesus could use me, the foremost sinner, to demonstrate his patience. This patience serves as an example for those who would believe in him and live forever. 
1TI.1.17	 Worship and glory belong forever to the eternal king, the immortal, invisible, and only God. Amen.
1TI.1.18	 Timothy, my child, I’m giving you this order about the prophecies that are still coming to you: Use these prophecies in faith and with a clear conscience to fight this noble war. 
1TI.1.19	 Some have refused to let their faith guide their conscience and their faith has been destroyed like a wrecked ship.
1TI.1.20	 Among these people are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan in order to teach them not to dishonor God.
1TI.2.1	 First of all, I encourage you to make petitions, prayers, intercessions, and prayers of thanks for all people, 
1TI.2.2	 for rulers, and for everyone who has authority over us. Pray for these people so that we can have a quiet and peaceful life always lived in a godly and reverent way. 
1TI.2.3	 This is good and pleases God our Savior. 
1TI.2.4	 He wants all people to be saved and to learn the truth. 
1TI.2.5	 There is one God. There is also one mediator between God and humans—a human, Christ Jesus. 
1TI.2.6	 He sacrificed himself for all people to free them from their sins.
1TI.2.6	This message is valid for every era. 
1TI.2.7	 I was appointed to spread this Good News and to be an apostle to teach people who are not Jewish about faith and truth. I’m telling you the truth. I’m not lying.
1TI.2.8	 I want men to offer prayers everywhere. They should raise their hands in prayer after putting aside their anger and any quarrels they have with anyone.
1TI.2.9	 I want women to show their beauty by dressing in appropriate clothes that are modest and respectable. Their beauty will be shown by what they do,
1TI.2.10	 This is what is proper for women who claim to have reverence for God.
1TI.2.11	 A woman must learn in silence, in keeping with her position. 
1TI.2.12	 I don’t allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man. Instead, she should be quiet. 
1TI.2.13	 After all, Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
1TI.2.14	 Besides that, Adam was not deceived. It was the woman who was deceived and sinned. 
1TI.2.15	 However, she ⌊and all women⌋ will be saved through the birth of the child,
1TI.3.1	 This is a statement that can be trusted: If anyone sets his heart on being a bishop,
1TI.3.2	 A bishop must have a good reputation. He must have only one wife, be sober, use good judgment, be respectable, be hospitable, and be able to teach. 
1TI.3.3	 He must not drink excessively or be a violent person, but he must be gentle. He must not be quarrelsome or love money. 
1TI.3.4	 He must manage his own family well. His children should respectfully obey him. 
1TI.3.5	 (If a man doesn’t know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) 
1TI.3.6	 He must not be a new Christian, or he might become arrogant like the devil and be condemned. 
1TI.3.7	 People who are not Christians must speak well of him, or he might become the victim of disgraceful insults that the devil sets as traps for him.
1TI.3.8	 Deacons 
1TI.3.9	 They must have clear consciences about possessing the mystery of the Christian faith. 
1TI.3.10	 First, a person must be evaluated. Then, if he has a good reputation, he may become a deacon.
1TI.3.11	 Their wives must also be of good character. They must not be gossips, but they must control their tempers and be trustworthy in every way.
1TI.3.12	 A deacon must have only one wife. Deacons must manage their children and their families well. 
1TI.3.13	 Those deacons who serve well gain an excellent reputation and will have confidence as a result of their faith in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	 I hope to visit you soon. However, I’m writing this to you 
1TI.3.15	 in case I’m delayed. I want you to know how people who are members of God’s family must live. God’s family is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
1TI.3.16	 The mystery that gives us our reverence for God is acknowledged to be great:
1TI.3.16	He 
1TI.3.16	was approved by the Spirit,
1TI.3.16	was seen by angels,
1TI.3.16	was announced throughout the nations,
1TI.3.16	was believed in the world,
1TI.3.16	and was taken to heaven in glory.
1TI.4.1	 The Spirit says clearly that in later times some believers will desert the Christian faith. They will follow spirits that deceive, and they will believe the teachings of demons. 
1TI.4.2	 These people will speak lies disguised as truth. Their consciences have been scarred as if branded by a red-hot iron. 
1TI.4.3	 They will try to stop others from getting married and from eating certain foods. God created food to be received with prayers of thanks by those who believe and know the truth. 
1TI.4.4	 Everything God created is good. Nothing should be rejected if it is received with prayers of thanks. 
1TI.4.5	 The word of God and prayer set it apart as holy.
1TI.4.6	 You are a good servant of Christ Jesus when you point these things out to our brothers and sisters. Then you will be nourished by the words of the Christian faith and the excellent teachings which you have followed closely. 
1TI.4.7	 Don’t have anything to do with godless myths that old women like to tell. Rather, train yourself to live a godly life. 
1TI.4.8	 Training the body helps a little, but godly living helps in every way. Godly living has the promise of life now and in the world to come. 
1TI.4.9	 This is a statement that can be trusted and deserves complete acceptance. 
1TI.4.10	 Certainly, we work hard and struggle to live a godly life, because we place our confidence in the living God. He is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.
1TI.4.11	 Insist on these things and teach them. 
1TI.4.12	 Don’t let anyone look down on you for being young. Instead, make your speech, behavior, love, faith, and purity an example for other believers. 
1TI.4.13	 Until I get there, concentrate on reading ⌊Scripture⌋ in worship, giving encouraging messages, and teaching people. 
1TI.4.14	 Don’t neglect the gift which you received through prophecy when the spiritual leaders 
1TI.4.15	 Practice these things. Devote your life to them so that everyone can see your progress. 
1TI.4.16	 Focus on your life and your teaching. Continue to do what I’ve told you. If you do this, you will save yourself and those who hear you.
1TI.5.1	 Never use harsh words when you correct an older man, but talk to him as if he were your father. Talk to younger men as if they were your brothers, 
1TI.5.2	 older women as if they were your mothers, and younger women as if they were your sisters, while keeping yourself morally pure.
1TI.5.3	 Honor widows who have no families. 
1TI.5.4	 The children or grandchildren of a widow must first learn to respect their own family by repaying their parents. This is pleasing in God’s sight.
1TI.5.5	 A widow who has no family has placed her confidence in God by praying and asking for his help night and day. 
1TI.5.6	 But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead although she is still alive. 
1TI.5.7	 Insist on these things so that widows will have good reputations. 
1TI.5.8	 If anyone doesn’t take care of his own relatives, especially his immediate family, he has denied the Christian faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
1TI.5.9	 Any widow who had only one husband and is at least 60 years old should be put on your list ⌊of widows⌋. 
1TI.5.10	 People should tell about the good things she has done: raising children, being hospitable, taking care of believers’ needs, helping the suffering, or always doing good things.
1TI.5.11	 Don’t include younger widows ⌊on your list⌋. Whenever their natural desires become stronger than their devotion to Christ, they’ll want to marry. 
1TI.5.12	 They condemn themselves by rejecting the Christian faith, the faith they first accepted. 
1TI.5.13	 At the same time, they learn to go around from house to house since they have nothing else to do. Not only this, but they also gossip and get involved in other people’s business, saying things they shouldn’t say.
1TI.5.14	 So I want younger widows to marry, have children, manage their homes, and not give the enemy any chance to ridicule them. 
1TI.5.15	 Some of them have already turned away to follow Satan. 
1TI.5.16	 If any woman is a believer and has relatives who are widows, she should help them. In this way the church is not burdened and can help widows who have no families.
1TI.5.17	 Give double honor to spiritual leaders 
1TI.5.18	 After all, Scripture says, “Never muzzle an ox when it is threshing 
1TI.5.19	 Don’t pay attention to an accusation against a spiritual leader unless it is supported by two or three witnesses. 
1TI.5.20	 Reprimand those leaders who sin. Do it in front of everyone so that the other leaders will also be afraid.
1TI.5.21	 I solemnly call on you in the sight of God, Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels to be impartial when you follow what I’ve told you. Never play favorites.
1TI.5.22	 Don’t be in a hurry to place your hands on anyone ⌊to ordain him⌋. Don’t participate in the sins of others. Keep yourself morally pure.
1TI.5.23	 Stop drinking only water. Instead, drink a little wine for your stomach because you are frequently sick.
1TI.5.24	 The sins of some people are obvious, going ahead of them to judgment. The sins of others follow them there. 
1TI.5.25	 In the same way, the good things that people do are obvious, and those that aren’t obvious can’t remain hidden.
1TI.6.1	 All slaves who believe must give complete respect to their own masters. In this way no one will speak evil of God’s name and what we teach. 
1TI.6.2	 Slaves whose masters also believe should respect their masters even though their masters are also believers. As a result, believers who are slaves should serve their masters even better because those who receive the benefit of their work are believers whom they love.
1TI.6.2	Teach and encourage people to do these things. 
1TI.6.3	 Whoever teaches false doctrine and doesn’t agree with the accurate words of our Lord Jesus Christ and godly teachings 
1TI.6.4	 is a conceited person. He shows that he doesn’t understand anything. Rather, he has an unhealthy desire to argue and quarrel about words. This produces jealousy, rivalry, cursing, suspicion, 
1TI.6.5	 and conflict between people whose corrupt minds have been robbed of the truth. They think that a godly life is a way to make a profit.
1TI.6.6	 A godly life brings huge profits to people who are content with what they have. 
1TI.6.7	 We didn’t bring anything into the world, and we can’t take anything out of it. 
1TI.6.8	 As long as we have food and clothes, we should be satisfied.
1TI.6.9	 But people who want to get rich keep falling into temptation. They are trapped by many stupid and harmful desires which drown them in destruction and ruin. 
1TI.6.10	 Certainly, the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. Some people who have set their hearts on getting rich have wandered away from the Christian faith and have caused themselves a lot of grief.
1TI.6.11	 But you, man of God, must avoid these things. Pursue what God approves of: a godly life, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness. 
1TI.6.12	 Fight the good fight for the Christian faith. Take hold of everlasting life to which you were called and about which you made a good testimony in front of many witnesses.
1TI.6.13	 In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and in the sight of Christ Jesus, who gave a good testimony in front of Pontius Pilate, 
1TI.6.14	 I insist that, until our Lord Jesus Christ appears, you obey this command completely. Then you cannot be blamed for doing anything wrong. 
1TI.6.15	 At the right time God will make this known. God is the blessed and only ruler. He is the King of kings and Lord of lords. 
1TI.6.16	 He is the only one who cannot die. He lives in light that no one can come near. No one has seen him, nor can they see him. Honor and power belong to him forever! Amen.
1TI.6.17	 Tell those who have the riches of this world not to be arrogant and not to place their confidence in anything as uncertain as riches. Instead, they should place their confidence in God who richly provides us with everything to enjoy. 
1TI.6.18	 Tell them to do good, to do a lot of good things, to be generous, and to share. 
1TI.6.19	 By doing this they store up a treasure for themselves which is a good foundation for the future. In this way they take hold of what life really is.
1TI.6.20	 Timothy, guard the Good News which has been entrusted to you. Turn away from pointless discussions and the claims of false knowledge that people use to oppose ⌊the Christian faith⌋. 
1TI.6.21	 Although some claim to have knowledge, they have abandoned the faith.
1TI.6.21	God’s good will 
2TI.1.1	 From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will—a will that contains Christ Jesus’ promise of life.
2TI.1.2	 To Timothy, my dear child.
2TI.1.2	Good will,
2TI.1.3	 I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day when I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as my ancestors did. 
2TI.1.4	 I remember your tears and want to see you so that I can be filled with happiness. 
2TI.1.5	 I’m reminded of how sincere your faith is. That faith first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice. I’m convinced that it also lives in you.
2TI.1.6	 You received a gift from God when I placed my hands on you ⌊to ordain you⌋. Now I’m reminding you to fan that gift into flames. 
2TI.1.7	 God didn’t give us a cowardly spirit but a spirit of power, love, and good judgment. 
2TI.1.8	 So never be ashamed to tell others about our Lord or be ashamed of me, his prisoner. Instead, by God’s power, join me in suffering for the sake of the Good News. 
2TI.1.9	 God saved us and called us to be holy, not because of what we had done, but because of his own plan and kindness.
2TI.1.10	 Now with the coming of our Savior Christ Jesus, he has revealed it. Christ has destroyed death, and through the Good News he has brought eternal life into full view. 
2TI.1.11	 I was appointed to be a messenger of this Good News, an apostle, and a teacher.
2TI.1.12	 For this reason I suffer as I do. However, I’m not ashamed. I know whom I trust. I’m convinced that he is able to protect what he had entrusted to me until that day.
2TI.1.13	 With faith and love for Christ Jesus, consider what you heard me say to be the pattern of accurate teachings. 
2TI.1.14	 With the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us, protect the Good News that has been entrusted to you.
2TI.1.15	 You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
2TI.1.16	 May the Lord be merciful to the family of Onesiphorus. He often took care of my needs and wasn’t ashamed that I was a prisoner. 
2TI.1.17	 When he arrived in Rome, he searched hard for me and found me. 
2TI.1.18	 May the Lord grant that Onesiphorus finds mercy when that day comes. You know very well that he did everything possible to help me in Ephesus.
2TI.2.1	 My child, find your source of strength in the kindness 
2TI.2.2	 You’ve heard my message, and it’s been confirmed by many witnesses. Entrust this message to faithful individuals who will be competent to teach others.
2TI.2.3	 Join me in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.4	 Whoever serves in the military doesn’t get mixed up in non-military activities. This pleases his commanding officer. 
2TI.2.5	 Whoever enters an athletic competition wins the prize only when playing by the rules. 
2TI.2.6	 A hard-working farmer should have the first share of the crops. 
2TI.2.7	 Understand what I’m saying. The Lord will help you understand all these things.
2TI.2.8	 Always think about Jesus Christ. He was brought back to life and is a descendant of David. This is the Good News that I tell others. 
2TI.2.9	 I’m suffering disgrace for spreading this Good News. I have even been put into prison like a criminal. However, God’s word is not imprisoned. 
2TI.2.10	 For that reason, I endure everything for the sake of those who have been chosen so that they, too, may receive salvation from Christ Jesus with glory that lasts forever. 
2TI.2.11	 This is a statement that can be trusted:
2TI.2.11	If we have died with him, we will live with him.
2TI.2.12	 If we endure, we will rule with him.
2TI.2.12	If we disown him, he will disown us.
2TI.2.13	 If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful
2TI.2.13	because he cannot be untrue to himself.
2TI.2.14	 Remind believers about these things, and warn them in the sight of God not to quarrel over words. Quarreling doesn’t do any good but only destroys those who are listening.
2TI.2.15	 Do your best to present yourself to God as a tried-and-true worker who isn’t ashamed to teach the word of truth correctly. 
2TI.2.16	 Avoid pointless discussions. People who ⌊pay attention to these pointless discussions⌋ will become more ungodly, 
2TI.2.17	 and what they say will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like that. 
2TI.2.18	 They have abandoned the truth. They are destroying the faith of others by saying that people who have died have already come back to life.
2TI.2.19	 In spite of all that, God’s ⌊people⌋ have a solid foundation. These words are engraved on it: “The Lord knows those who belong to him,” and “Whoever worships the Lord must give up doing wrong.”
2TI.2.20	 In a large house there are not only objects made of gold and silver, but also those made of wood and clay. Some objects are honored when they are used; others aren’t. 
2TI.2.21	 Those who stop associating with dishonorable people will be honored. They will be set apart for the master’s use, prepared to do good things.
2TI.2.22	 Stay away from lusts which tempt young people. Pursue what has God’s approval. Pursue faith, love, and peace together with those who worship the Lord with a pure heart. 
2TI.2.23	 Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments. You know they cause quarrels. 
2TI.2.24	 A servant of the Lord must not quarrel. Instead, he must be kind to everyone. He must be a good teacher. He must be willing to suffer wrong. 
2TI.2.25	 He must be gentle in correcting those who oppose the Good News. Maybe God will allow them to change the way they think and act and lead them to know the truth. 
2TI.2.26	 Then they might come back to their senses and God will free them from the devil’s snare so that they can do his will.
2TI.3.1	 You must understand this: In the last days there will be violent periods of time. 
2TI.3.2	 People will be selfish and love money. They will brag, be arrogant, and use abusive language. They will curse their parents, show no gratitude, have no respect for what is holy, 
2TI.3.3	 and lack normal affection for their families. They will refuse to make peace with anyone. They will be slanderous, lack self-control, be brutal, and have no love for what is good. 
2TI.3.4	 They will be traitors. They will be reckless and conceited. They will love pleasure rather than God. 
2TI.3.5	 They will appear to have a godly life, but they will not let its power change them. Stay away from such people.
2TI.3.6	 Some of these men go into homes and mislead weak-minded women who are burdened with sins and led by all kinds of desires. 
2TI.3.7	 These women are always studying but are never able to recognize the truth.
2TI.3.8	 As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupt, and the faith they teach is counterfeit. 
2TI.3.9	 Certainly, they won’t get very far. Like the stupidity of Jannes and Jambres, their stupidity will be plain to everyone.
2TI.3.10	 But you know all about my teachings, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, and my endurance. 
2TI.3.11	 You also know about the kind of persecutions and sufferings which happened to me in the cities of Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions, and the Lord rescued me from all of them. 
2TI.3.12	 Those who try to live a godly life because they believe in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
2TI.3.13	 But evil people and phony preachers will go from bad to worse as they mislead people and are themselves misled.
2TI.3.14	 However, continue in what you have learned and found to be true. You know who your teachers were. 
2TI.3.15	 From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures. They have the power to give you wisdom so that you can be saved through faith in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	 Every Scripture passage is inspired by God. All of them are useful for teaching, pointing out errors, correcting people, and training them for a life that has God’s approval. 
2TI.3.17	 They equip God’s servants so that they are completely prepared to do good things.
2TI.4.1	 I solemnly call on you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge those who are living and those who are dead. I do this because Christ Jesus will come to rule ⌊the world⌋. 
2TI.4.2	 Be ready to spread the word whether or not the time is right. Point out errors, warn people, and encourage them. Be very patient when you teach.
2TI.4.3	 A time will come when people will not listen to accurate teachings. Instead, they will follow their own desires and surround themselves with teachers who tell them what they want to hear. 
2TI.4.4	 People will refuse to listen to the truth and turn to myths.
2TI.4.5	 But you must keep a clear head in everything. Endure suffering. Do the work of a missionary. Devote yourself completely to your work.
2TI.4.6	 My life is coming to an end, and it is now time for me to be poured out as a sacrifice to God. 
2TI.4.7	 I have fought the good fight. I have completed the race. I have kept the faith. 
2TI.4.8	 The prize that shows I have God’s approval is now waiting for me. The Lord, who is a fair judge, will give me that prize on that day. He will give it not only to me but also to everyone who is eagerly waiting for him to come again.
2TI.4.9	 Hurry to visit me soon. 
2TI.4.10	 Demas has abandoned me. He fell in love with this present world and went to the city of Thessalonica. Crescens went to the province of Galatia, and Titus went to the province of Dalmatia. 
2TI.4.11	 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you. He is useful to me in my work. 
2TI.4.12	 I’m sending Tychicus to the city of Ephesus as my representative.
2TI.4.13	 When you come, bring the warm coat I left with Carpus in the city of Troas. Also bring the scrolls and especially the parchments.
2TI.4.14	 Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will pay him back for what he did. 
2TI.4.15	 Watch out for him. He violently opposed what we said. 
2TI.4.16	 At my first hearing no one stood up in my defense. Everyone abandoned me. I pray that it won’t be held against them. 
2TI.4.17	 However, the Lord stood by me and gave me strength so that I could finish spreading the Good News for all the nations to hear. I was snatched out of a lion’s mouth. 
2TI.4.18	 The Lord will rescue me from all harm and will take me safely to his heavenly kingdom. Glory belongs to him forever! Amen.
2TI.4.19	 Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus. 
2TI.4.20	 Erastus stayed in the city of Corinth and I left Trophimus in the city of Miletus because he was sick. 
2TI.4.21	 Hurry to visit me before winter comes. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers and sisters send you greetings.
2TI.4.22	 The Lord be with you. His good will 
TIT.1.1	 From Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I was sent to lead God’s chosen people to faith and to the knowledge of the truth that leads to a godly life. 
TIT.1.2	 My message is based on the confidence of eternal life. God, who never lies, promised this eternal life before the world began. 
TIT.1.3	 God has revealed this in every era by spreading his word. I was entrusted with this word by the command of God our Savior.
TIT.1.4	 To Titus, a genuine child in the faith we share.
TIT.1.4	Good will 
TIT.1.5	 I left you in Crete to do what still needed to be done—appointing spiritual leaders 
TIT.1.6	 A spiritual leader must have a good reputation. He must have only one wife and have children who are believers. His children shouldn’t be known for having wild lifestyles or being rebellious. 
TIT.1.7	 Because a bishop 
TIT.1.8	 Instead, he must be hospitable, love what is good, use good judgment, be fair and moral, and have self-control. 
TIT.1.9	 He must be devoted to the trustworthy message we teach. Then he can use these accurate teachings to encourage people and correct those who oppose the word.
TIT.1.10	 There are many believers, especially converts from Judaism, who are rebellious. They speak nonsense and deceive people. 
TIT.1.11	 They must be silenced because they are ruining whole families by teaching what they shouldn’t teach. This is the shameful way they make money.
TIT.1.12	 Even one of their own prophets said, “Cretans are always liars, savage animals, and lazy gluttons.” 
TIT.1.13	 That statement is true. For this reason, sharply correct believers so that they continue to have faith that is alive and well. 
TIT.1.14	 They shouldn’t pay attention to Jewish myths or commands given by people who are always rejecting the truth. 
TIT.1.15	 Everything is clean 
TIT.1.16	 They claim to know God, but they deny him by what they do. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit to do anything good.
TIT.2.1	 Tell believers to live the kind of life that goes along with accurate teachings. 
TIT.2.2	 Tell older men to be sober. Tell them to be men of good character, to use good judgment, and to be well-grounded in faith, love, and endurance.
TIT.2.3	 Tell older women to live their lives in a way that shows they are dedicated to God. Tell them not to be gossips or addicted to alcohol, but to be examples of virtue. 
TIT.2.4	 In this way they will teach young women to show love to their husbands and children, 
TIT.2.5	 to use good judgment, and to be morally pure. Also, tell them to teach young women to be homemakers, to be kind, and to place themselves under their husbands’ authority. Then no one can speak evil of God’s word.
TIT.2.6	 Encourage young men to use good judgment. 
TIT.2.7	 Always set an example by doing good things. When you teach, be an example of moral purity and dignity. 
TIT.2.8	 Speak an accurate message that cannot be condemned. Then those who oppose us will be ashamed because they cannot say anything bad about us.
TIT.2.9	 Tell slaves who are believers to place themselves under their masters’ authority in everything they do. Tell them to please their masters, not to argue with them 
TIT.2.10	 or steal from them. Instead, tell slaves to show their masters how good and completely loyal they can be. Then they will show the beauty of the teachings about God our Savior in everything they do.
TIT.2.11	 After all, God’s saving kindness 
TIT.2.12	 It trains us to avoid ungodly lives filled with worldly desires so that we can live self-controlled, moral, and godly lives in this present world. 
TIT.2.13	 At the same time we can expect what we hope for—the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. 
TIT.2.14	 He gave himself for us to set us free from every sin and to cleanse us so that we can be his special people who are enthusiastic about doing good things.
TIT.2.15	 Tell these things to the believers. Encourage and correct them, using your full authority. Don’t let anyone ignore you.
TIT.3.1	 Remind believers to willingly place themselves under the authority of government officials. Believers should obey them and be ready to help them with every good thing they do. 
TIT.3.2	 Believers shouldn’t curse anyone or be quarrelsome, but they should be gentle and show courtesy to everyone.
TIT.3.3	 Indeed, we, too, were once stupid, disobedient, and misled. We were slaves to many kinds of lusts and pleasures. We were mean and jealous. We were hated, and we hated each other.
TIT.3.4	 However, when God our Savior made his kindness and love for humanity appear, 
TIT.3.5	 he saved us, but not because of anything we had done to gain his approval. Instead, because of his mercy he saved us through the washing in which the Holy Spirit gives us new birth and renewal. 
TIT.3.6	 God poured a generous amount of the Spirit on us through Jesus Christ our Savior. 
TIT.3.7	 As a result, God in his kindness 
TIT.3.8	 This is a statement that can be trusted. I want you to insist on these things so that those who believe in God can concentrate on setting an example by doing good things. This is good and helps other people.
TIT.3.9	 Avoid foolish controversies, arguments about genealogies, quarrels, and fights about Moses’ Teachings. This is useless and worthless. 
TIT.3.10	 Have nothing to do with people who continue to teach false doctrine after you have warned them once or twice. 
TIT.3.11	 You know that people like this are corrupt. They are sinners condemned by their own actions.
TIT.3.12	 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, hurry to visit me in the city of Nicopolis. I have decided to spend the winter there. 
TIT.3.13	 Give Zenas the lawyer and Apollos your best support for their trip so that they will have everything they need.
TIT.3.14	 Our people should also learn how to set an example by doing good things when urgent needs arise so that they can live productive lives.
TIT.3.15	 Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet our faithful friends.
TIT.3.15	⌊God’s⌋ good will 
PHM.1.1	 From Paul, who is a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and our brother Timothy.
PHM.1.1	To our dear coworker Philemon, 
PHM.1.2	 our sister Apphia, our fellow soldier Archippus, and the church that meets in your house.
PHM.1.3	 Good will 
PHM.1.4	 ⌊Philemon,⌋ I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers because 
PHM.1.5	 I hear about your faithfulness to the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God’s people. 
PHM.1.6	 As you share the faith you have in common with others, I pray that you may come to have a complete knowledge of every blessing we have in Christ. 
PHM.1.7	 Your love ⌊for God’s people⌋ gives me a lot of joy and encouragement. You, brother, have comforted God’s people.
PHM.1.8	 Christ makes me bold enough to order you to do the right thing. 
PHM.1.9	 However, I would prefer to make an appeal on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an old man and now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, 
PHM.1.10	 appeal to you for my child Onesimus [Useful]. I became his spiritual father here in prison. 
PHM.1.11	 Once he was useless to you, but now he is very useful to both of us.
PHM.1.12	 I am sending him back to you. This is like sending you a part of myself. 
PHM.1.13	 I wanted to keep him here with me. Then he could have served me in your place while I am in prison for spreading the Good News. 
PHM.1.14	 Yet, I didn’t want to do anything without your consent. I want you to do this favor for me out of your own free will without feeling forced to do it.
PHM.1.15	 Maybe Onesimus was gone for a while so that you could have him back forever—
PHM.1.16	 no longer as a slave but better than a slave—as a dear brother. He is especially dear to me, but even more so to you, both as a person and as a Christian.
PHM.1.17	 If you think of me as your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. 
PHM.1.18	 If he wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to me. 
PHM.1.19	 I, Paul, promise to pay it back. I’m writing this with my own hand. I won’t even mention that you owe me your life. 
PHM.1.20	 So, because we’re brothers in the Lord, do something for me. Give me some comfort because of Christ. 
PHM.1.21	 I am confident as I write to you that you will do this. And I know that you will do even more than I ask.
PHM.1.22	 One more thing—have a guest room ready for me. I hope that, because of your prayers, God will give me back to you.
PHM.1.23	 Epaphras, who is a prisoner because of Christ Jesus like I am, 
PHM.1.24	 and my coworkers Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke send you greetings.
PHM.1.25	 The good will of our Lord Jesus Christ be yours.
HEB.1.1	 In the past God spoke to our ancestors at many different times and in many different ways through the prophets. 
HEB.1.2	 In these last days he has spoken to us through his Son. God made his Son responsible for everything. His Son is the one through whom God made the universe. 
HEB.1.3	 His Son is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact likeness of God’s being. He holds everything together through his powerful words. After he had cleansed people from their sins, he received the highest position, the one next to the Father in heaven.
HEB.1.4	 The Son has become greater than the angels since he has been given a name that is superior to theirs. 
HEB.1.5	 God never said to any of his angels,
HEB.1.5	“You are my Son.
HEB.1.5	Today I have become your Father.”
HEB.1.5	And God never said to any of his angels,
HEB.1.5	“I will be his Father,
HEB.1.5	and he will be my Son.”
HEB.1.6	 When God was about to send his firstborn Son into the world, he said,
HEB.1.6	“All of God’s angels must worship him.”
HEB.1.7	 God said about the angels,
HEB.1.7	“He makes his messengers winds.
HEB.1.7	He makes his servants flames of fire.”
HEB.1.8	 But God said about his Son,
HEB.1.8	“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
HEB.1.8	The scepter in your kingdom is a scepter for justice.
HEB.1.9	 You have loved what is right and hated what is wrong.
HEB.1.9	That is why God, your God,
HEB.1.9	anointed you, rather than your companions, with the oil of joy.”
HEB.1.10	 God also said,
HEB.1.10	“Lord, in the beginning you laid the foundation of the earth.
HEB.1.10	With your own hands you made the heavens.
HEB.1.11	 They will come to an end, but you will live forever.
HEB.1.11	They will all wear out like clothes.
HEB.1.12	 They will be taken off like a coat.
HEB.1.12	You will change them like clothes.
HEB.1.12	But you remain the same, and your life will never end.
HEB.1.13	 But God never said to any of the angels,
HEB.1.13	“Sit in the highest position in heaven
HEB.1.13	until I make your enemies your footstool.”
HEB.1.14	 What are all the angels? They are spirits sent to serve those who are going to receive salvation.
HEB.2.1	 For this reason we must pay closer attention to what we have heard. Then we won’t drift away ⌊from the truth⌋. 
HEB.2.2	 After all, the message that the angels brought was reliable, and every violation and act of disobedience was properly punished. 
HEB.2.3	 So how will we escape punishment if we reject the important message, the message that God saved us? First, the Lord told this saving message. Then those who heard him confirmed that message. 
HEB.2.4	 God verified what they said through miraculous signs, amazing things, other powerful acts, and with other gifts from the Holy Spirit as he wanted.
HEB.2.5	 He didn’t put the world that will come (about which we are talking) under the angels’ control. 
HEB.2.6	 Instead, someone has declared this somewhere in Scripture:
HEB.2.6	“What is a mortal that you should remember him,
HEB.2.6	or the Son of Man 
HEB.2.7	 You made him a little lower than the angels.
HEB.2.7	You crowned him with glory and honor.
HEB.2.8	 You put everything under his control.”
HEB.2.8	When God put everything under his Son’s control, nothing was left out.
HEB.2.8	However, at the present time we still don’t see everything under his Son’s control. 
HEB.2.9	 Jesus was made a little lower than the angels, but we see him crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death. Through God’s kindness 
HEB.2.10	 God is the one for whom and through whom everything exists. Therefore, while God was bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was the right time to bring Jesus, the source of their salvation, to the end of his work through suffering.
HEB.2.11	 Jesus, who makes people holy, and all those who are made holy have the same Father. That is why Jesus isn’t ashamed to call them brothers and sisters. 
HEB.2.12	 He says,
HEB.2.12	“I will tell my people about your name.
HEB.2.12	I will praise you within the congregation.”
HEB.2.13	 In addition, Jesus says,
HEB.2.13	“I will trust him.”
HEB.2.13	And Jesus says,
HEB.2.13	“I am here with the sons and daughters God has given me.”
HEB.2.14	 Since all of these sons and daughters have flesh and blood, Jesus took on flesh and blood to be like them. He did this so that by dying he would destroy the one who had power over death (that is, the devil). 
HEB.2.15	 In this way he would free those who were slaves all their lives because they were afraid of dying. 
HEB.2.16	 So Jesus helps Abraham’s descendants rather than helping angels. 
HEB.2.17	 Therefore, he had to become like his brothers and sisters so that he could be merciful. He became like them so that he could serve as a faithful chief priest in God’s presence and make peace with God for their sins. 
HEB.2.18	 Because Jesus experienced temptation when he suffered, he is able to help others when they are tempted.
HEB.3.1	 Brothers and sisters, you are holy partners in a heavenly calling. So look carefully at Jesus, the apostle and chief priest about whom we make our declaration of faith. 
HEB.3.2	 Jesus is faithful to God, who appointed him, in the same way that Moses was faithful when he served in God’s house. 
HEB.3.3	 Jesus deserves more praise than Moses in the same way that the builder of a house is praised more than the house. 
HEB.3.4	 After all, every house has a builder, but the builder of everything is God.
HEB.3.5	 Moses was a faithful servant in God’s household. He told ⌊the people⌋ what God would say in the future. 
HEB.3.6	 But Christ is a faithful son in charge of God’s household. We are his household if we continue to have courage and to be proud of the confidence we have.
HEB.3.7	 As the Holy Spirit says,
HEB.3.7	“If you hear God speak today, don’t be stubborn.
HEB.3.8	 Don’t be stubborn like those who rebelled
HEB.3.8	and tested me in the desert.
HEB.3.9	 That is where your ancestors tested me,
HEB.3.10	 although they had seen what I had done for 40 years.
HEB.3.10	That is why I was angry with those people. So I said,
HEB.3.10	‘Their hearts continue to stray,
HEB.3.10	and they have not learned my ways.’
HEB.3.11	 So I angrily took a solemn oath
HEB.3.11	that they would never enter my place of rest.”
HEB.3.12	 Be careful, brothers and sisters, that none of you ever develop a wicked, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. 
HEB.3.13	 Encourage each other every day while you have the opportunity. If you do this, none of you will be deceived by sin and become stubborn. 
HEB.3.14	 After all, we will remain Christ’s partners only if we continue to hold on to our original confidence until the end.
HEB.3.15	 Scripture says,
HEB.3.15	“If you hear God speak today, don’t be stubborn.
HEB.3.15	Don’t be stubborn like those who rebelled.”
HEB.3.16	 Who heard God and rebelled? All those whom Moses led out of Egypt rebelled. 
HEB.3.17	 With whom was God angry for 40 years? He was angry with those who sinned and died in the desert. 
HEB.3.18	 Who did God swear would never enter his place of rest? He was talking about those who didn’t obey him. 
HEB.3.19	 So we see that they couldn’t enter his place of rest because they didn’t believe.
HEB.4.1	 God’s promise that we may enter his place of rest still stands. We are afraid that some of you think you won’t enter his place of rest. 
HEB.4.2	 We have heard the same Good News that your ancestors heard. But the message didn’t help those who heard it in the past because they didn’t believe.
HEB.4.3	 We who believe are entering that place of rest. As God said, “So I angrily took a solemn oath that they would never enter my place of rest.” God said this even though he had finished his work when he created the world. 
HEB.4.4	 Somewhere in Scripture God has said this about the seventh day: “On the seventh day God rested from all his work.”
HEB.4.5	 God also said in the same passage, “They will never enter my place of rest.” 
HEB.4.6	 However, some people enter that place of rest. Those who heard the Good News in the past did not enter God’s place of rest because they did not obey God. 
HEB.4.7	 So God set another day. That day is today. Many years after ⌊your ancestors failed to enter that place of rest⌋ God spoke about it through David in the passage already quoted: “If you hear God speak today, don’t be stubborn.” 
HEB.4.8	 If Joshua had given the people rest, God would not have spoken about another day. 
HEB.4.9	 Therefore, a time of rest and worship exists for God’s people. 
HEB.4.10	 Those who entered his place of rest also rested from their work as God did from his.
HEB.4.11	 So we must make every effort to enter that place of rest. Then no one will be lost by following the example of those who refused to obey.
HEB.4.12	 God’s word is living and active. It is sharper than any two-edged sword and cuts as deep as the place where soul and spirit meet, the place where joints and marrow meet. God’s word judges a person’s thoughts and intentions. 
HEB.4.13	 No creature can hide from God. Everything is uncovered and exposed for him to see. We must answer to him.
HEB.4.14	 We need to hold on to our declaration of faith: We have a superior chief priest who has gone through the heavens. That person is Jesus, the Son of God. 
HEB.4.15	 We have a chief priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses. He was tempted in every way that we are, but he didn’t sin. 
HEB.4.16	 So we can go confidently to the throne of God’s kindness 
HEB.5.1	 Every chief priest is chosen from humans to represent them in front of God, that is, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sin. 
HEB.5.2	 The chief priest can be gentle with people who are ignorant and easily deceived, because he also has weaknesses. 
HEB.5.3	 Because he has weaknesses, he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins in the same way that he does for the sins of his people.
HEB.5.4	 No one takes this honor for himself. Instead, God calls him as he called Aaron. 
HEB.5.5	 So Christ did not take the glory of being a chief priest for himself. Instead, the glory was given to him by God, who said,
HEB.5.5	“You are my Son.
HEB.5.5	Today I have become your Father.”
HEB.5.6	 In another place in Scripture, God said,
HEB.5.6	“You are a priest forever,
HEB.5.6	in the way Melchizedek was a priest.”
HEB.5.7	 During his life on earth, Jesus prayed to God, who could save him from death. He prayed and pleaded with loud crying and tears, and he was heard because of his devotion to God. 
HEB.5.8	 Although Jesus was the Son ⌊of God⌋, he learned to be obedient through his sufferings. 
HEB.5.9	 After he had finished his work, he became the source of eternal salvation for everyone who obeys him. 
HEB.5.10	 God appointed him chief priest in the way Melchizedek was a priest.
HEB.5.11	 We have a lot to explain about this. But since you have become too lazy to pay attention, explaining it to you is hard. 
HEB.5.12	 By now you should be teachers. Instead, you still need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God’s word. You need milk, not solid food. 
HEB.5.13	 All those who live on milk lack the experience to talk about what is right. They are still babies. 
HEB.5.14	 However, solid food is for mature people, whose minds are trained by practice to know the difference between good and evil.
HEB.6.1	 With this in mind, we should stop going over the elementary truths about Christ and move on to topics for more mature people. We shouldn’t repeat the basics about turning away from the useless things we did and the basics about faith in God. 
HEB.6.2	 We shouldn’t repeat the basic teachings about such things as baptisms, setting people apart for holy tasks, dead people coming back to life, and eternal judgment. 
HEB.6.3	 If God permits, we will do this.
HEB.6.4	 Some people once had God’s light. They experienced the heavenly gift and shared in the Holy Spirit. 
HEB.6.5	 They experienced the goodness of God’s word and the powers of the world to come. 
HEB.6.6	 Yet, they have deserted ⌊Christ⌋. They are crucifying the Son of God again and publicly disgracing him. Therefore, they cannot be led a second time to God.
HEB.6.7	 God blesses the earth. So rain often falls on it, and it produces useful crops for farmers. 
HEB.6.8	 However, if the earth produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.
HEB.6.9	 Dear friends, even though we say these things, we are still convinced that better things are in store for you and that they will save you. 
HEB.6.10	 God is fair. He won’t forget what you’ve done or the love you’ve shown for him. You helped his holy people, and you continue to help them. 
HEB.6.11	 We want each of you to prove that you’re working hard so that you will remain confident until the end. 
HEB.6.12	 Then, instead of being lazy, you will imitate those who are receiving the promises through faith and patience.
HEB.6.13	 God made a promise to Abraham. Since he had no one greater on whom to base his oath, he based it on himself. 
HEB.6.14	 He said, “I will certainly bless you and give you many descendants.” 
HEB.6.15	 So Abraham received what God promised because he waited patiently for it.
HEB.6.16	 When people take oaths, they base their oaths on someone greater than themselves. Their oaths guarantee what they say and end all arguments. 
HEB.6.17	 God wouldn’t change his plan. He wanted to make this perfectly clear to those who would receive his promise, so he took an oath. 
HEB.6.18	 God did this so that we would be encouraged. God cannot lie when he takes an oath or makes a promise. These two things can never be changed. Those of us who have taken refuge in him hold on to the confidence we have been given. 
HEB.6.19	 We have this confidence as a sure and strong anchor for our lives. This confidence goes into the ⌊holy⌋ place behind the curtain 
HEB.6.20	 where Jesus went before us on our behalf. He has become the chief priest forever in the way Melchizedek was a priest.
HEB.7.1	 Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of the Most High God. He met Abraham and blessed him when Abraham was returning from defeating the kings. 
HEB.7.2	 Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything he had captured.
HEB.7.2	In the first place, Melchizedek’s name means king of righteousness. He is also called king of Salem (which means king of peace). 
HEB.7.3	 No one knows anything about Melchizedek’s father, mother, or ancestors. No one knows when he was born or when he died. Like the Son of God, Melchizedek continues to be a priest forever.
HEB.7.4	 You can see how important Melchizedek was. Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had captured, even though Abraham was the father of the chosen people. 
HEB.7.5	 Moses’ Teachings say that members of the tribe of Levi who become priests must receive a tenth of everything from the people. The priests collect it from their own people, Abraham’s descendants. 
HEB.7.6	 Although Melchizedek was not from the tribe of Levi, he received a tenth of everything from Abraham. Then Melchizedek blessed Abraham, who had God’s promises. 
HEB.7.7	 No one can deny that the more important person blesses the less important person.
HEB.7.8	 Priests receive a tenth of everything, but they die. Melchizedek received a tenth of everything, but we are told that he lives. 
HEB.7.9	 We could even say that when Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything, Levi was giving a tenth of everything. Levi gave, although later his descendants would receive a tenth of everything. 
HEB.7.10	 Even though Levi had not yet been born, he was in the body of Abraham when Melchizedek met him.
HEB.7.11	 The people established the Levitical priesthood based on instructions they received. If the work of the Levitical priests had been perfect, we wouldn’t need to speak about another kind of priest. However, we speak about another kind of priest, a priest like Melchizedek, not a Levitical priest like Aaron.
HEB.7.12	 When a different kind of priesthood is established, the regulations for those priests are different. 
HEB.7.13	 The priest whom we are talking about was a member of a different tribe. No one from that tribe ever served as a priest at the altar. 
HEB.7.14	 Everyone knows that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah. Moses never said anything about priests coming from that tribe. 
HEB.7.15	 The regulations were different. This became clear when a different priest who is like Melchizedek appeared. 
HEB.7.16	 That person is a priest, not because he met human requirements, but because he has power that comes from a life that cannot be destroyed. 
HEB.7.17	 The Scriptures say the following about him: “You are a priest forever, in the way Melchizedek was a priest.” 
HEB.7.18	 The former requirements are rejected because they are weak and useless. 
HEB.7.19	 Moses’ Teachings couldn’t accomplish everything that God required. But we have something else that gives us greater confidence and allows us to approach God.
HEB.7.20	 None of this happened without an oath. The men from the tribe of Levi may have become priests without an oath, 
HEB.7.21	 but Jesus became a priest when God took an oath. God said about him, “The Lord has taken an oath and will not change his mind. You are a priest forever.” 
HEB.7.22	 In this way Jesus has become the guarantee of a better promise.
HEB.7.23	 There was a long succession of priests because when a priest died he could no longer serve. 
HEB.7.24	 But Jesus lives forever, so he serves as a priest forever. 
HEB.7.25	 That is why he is always able to save those who come to God through him. He can do this because he always lives and intercedes for them.
HEB.7.26	 We need a chief priest who is holy, innocent, pure, set apart from sinners, and who has the highest position in heaven. 
HEB.7.27	 We need a priest who doesn’t have to bring daily sacrifices as those chief priests did. First they brought sacrifices for their own sins, and then they brought sacrifices for the sins of the people. Jesus brought the sacrifice for the sins of the people once and for all when he sacrificed himself. 
HEB.7.28	 Moses’ Teachings designated mortals as chief priests even though they had weaknesses. But God’s promise, which came after Moses’ Teachings, designated the Son who forever accomplished everything that God required.
HEB.8.1	 The main point we want to make is this: We do have this kind of chief priest. This chief priest has received the highest position, the throne of majesty in heaven. 
HEB.8.2	 He serves as priest of the holy place and of the true tent set up by the Lord and not by any human.
HEB.8.3	 Every chief priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Therefore, this chief priest had to offer something. 
HEB.8.4	 If he were on earth, he would not even be a priest. On earth ⌊other⌋ priests offer gifts by following the instructions that Moses gave. 
HEB.8.5	 They serve at a place that is a pattern, a shadow, of what is in heaven. When Moses was about to make the tent, God warned him, “Be sure to make everything based on the plan I showed you on the mountain.”
HEB.8.6	 Jesus has been given a priestly work that is superior to the Levitical priests’ work. He also brings a better promise 
HEB.8.7	 If nothing had been wrong with the first promise, no one would look for another one. 
HEB.8.8	 But God found something wrong with his people and said to them,
HEB.8.8	“The days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new promise to Israel and Judah. 
HEB.8.9	 It will not be like the promise that I made to their ancestors when I took them by the hand and brought them out of Egypt. They rejected that promise, so I ignored them, says the Lord. 
HEB.8.10	 But this is the promise that I will make to Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my teachings inside them, and I will write those teachings on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
HEB.8.11	 No longer will each person teach his neighbors or his relatives by saying, ‘Know the Lord.’ All of them from the least important to the most important will all know me 
HEB.8.12	 because I will forgive their wickedness and I will no longer hold their sins against them.”
HEB.8.13	 God made this new promise and showed that the first promise was outdated. What is outdated and aging will soon disappear.
HEB.9.1	 The first promise had rules for the priests’ service. It also had a holy place on earth. 
HEB.9.2	 A tent was set up. The first part of this tent was called the holy place. The lamp stand, the table, and the bread of the presence were in this part of the tent. 
HEB.9.3	 Behind the second curtain was the part of the tent called the most holy place. 
HEB.9.4	 It contained the gold incense burner and the ark of the Lord’s promise. The ark was completely covered with gold. In the ark were the gold jar filled with manna, Aaron’s staff that had blossomed, and the tablets on which the promise 
HEB.9.5	 Above the ark were the angels 
HEB.9.6	 That is how these two parts of the tent were set up. The priests always went into the first part of the tent to perform their duties. 
HEB.9.7	 But only the chief priest went into the second part of the tent. Once a year he entered and brought blood that he offered for himself and for the things that the people did wrong unintentionally. 
HEB.9.8	 The Holy Spirit used this to show that the way into the most holy place was not open while the tent was still in use.
HEB.9.9	 The first part of the tent is an example for the present time. The gifts and sacrifices that were brought there could not give the worshiper a clear conscience. 
HEB.9.10	 These gifts and sacrifices were meant to be food, drink, and items used in various purification ceremonies. These ceremonies were required for the body until God would establish a new way of doing things.
HEB.9.11	 But Christ came as a chief priest of the good things that are now here. Christ went through a better, more perfect tent that was not made by human hands and that is not part of this created world. 
HEB.9.12	 He used his own blood, not the blood of goats and bulls, for the sacrifice. He went into the most holy place and offered this sacrifice once and for all to free us forever.
HEB.9.13	 The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of cows sprinkled on unclean 
HEB.9.14	 The blood of Christ, who had no defect, does even more. Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself to God and cleansed our consciences from the useless things we had done. Now we can serve the living God.
HEB.9.15	 Because Christ offered himself to God, he is able to bring a new promise from God. Through his death he paid the price to set people free from the sins they committed under the first promise. He did this so that those who are called can be guaranteed an inheritance that will last forever.
HEB.9.16	 In order for a will to take effect, it must be shown that the one who made it has died. 
HEB.9.17	 A will is used only after a person is dead because it goes into effect only when a person dies.
HEB.9.18	 That is why even the first promise was made with blood. 
HEB.9.19	 As Scripture tells us, Moses told all the people every commandment. Then he took the blood of calves and goats together with some water, red yarn, and hyssop and sprinkled the scroll and all the people. 
HEB.9.20	 He said, “Here is the blood that seals the promise God has made to you.” 
HEB.9.21	 In the same way, Moses sprinkled blood on the tent and on everything used in worship. 
HEB.9.22	 As Moses’ Teachings tell us, blood was used to cleanse almost everything, because if no blood is shed, no sins can be forgiven.
HEB.9.23	 The copies of the things in heaven had to be cleansed by these sacrifices. But the heavenly things themselves had to be cleansed by better sacrifices. 
HEB.9.24	 Christ didn’t go into a holy place made by human hands. He didn’t go into a model of the real thing. Instead, he went into heaven to appear in God’s presence on our behalf. 
HEB.9.25	 Every year the chief priest went into the holy place to make a sacrifice with blood that isn’t his own. However, Christ didn’t go into heaven to sacrifice himself again and again. 
HEB.9.26	 Otherwise, he would have had to suffer many times since the world was created. But now, at the end of the ages, he has appeared once to remove sin by his sacrifice. 
HEB.9.27	 People die once, and after that they are judged. 
HEB.9.28	 Likewise, Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of humanity, and after that he will appear a second time. This time he will not deal with sin, but he will save those who eagerly wait for him.
HEB.10.1	 Moses’ Teachings with their yearly cycle of sacrifices are only a shadow of the good things in the future. They aren’t an exact likeness of those things. They can never make those who worship perfect. 
HEB.10.2	 If these sacrifices could have made the worshipers perfect, the sacrifices would have stopped long ago. Those who worship would have been cleansed once and for all. Their consciences would have been free from sin. 
HEB.10.3	 Instead, this yearly cycle of sacrifices reminded people of their sins. 
HEB.10.4	 (The blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sins.)
HEB.10.5	 For this reason, when Christ came into the world, he said,
HEB.10.5	“‘You did not want sacrifices and offerings,
HEB.10.5	but you prepared a body for me.
HEB.10.6	 You did not approve of burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.’
HEB.10.7	 Then I said, ‘I have come!
HEB.10.7	(It is written about me in the scroll of the book.)
HEB.10.7	I have come to do what you want, my God.’ ”
HEB.10.8	 In this passage Christ first said, “You did not want sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin. You did not approve of them.” (These are the sacrifices that Moses’ Teachings require people to offer.) 
HEB.10.9	 Then Christ says, “I have come to do what you want.” He did away with sacrifices in order to establish the obedience that God wants. 
HEB.10.10	 We have been set apart as holy because Jesus Christ did what God wanted him to do by sacrificing his body once and for all.
HEB.10.11	 Every day each priest performed his religious duty. He offered the same type of sacrifice again and again. Yet, these sacrifices could never take away sins. 
HEB.10.12	 However, this chief priest made one sacrifice for sins, and this sacrifice lasts forever. Then he received the highest position in heaven. 
HEB.10.13	 Since that time, he has been waiting for his enemies to be made his footstool. 
HEB.10.14	 With one sacrifice he accomplished the work of setting them apart for God forever.
HEB.10.15	 The Holy Spirit tells us the same thing: 
HEB.10.16	 “This is the promise 
HEB.10.17	 Then he adds, “I will no longer hold their sins and their disobedience against them.”
HEB.10.18	 When sins are forgiven, there is no longer any need to sacrifice for sins.
HEB.10.19	 Brothers and sisters, because of the blood of Jesus we can now confidently go into the holy place. 
HEB.10.20	 Jesus has opened a new and living way for us to go through the curtain. (The curtain is his own body.) 
HEB.10.21	 We have a superior priest in charge of God’s house. 
HEB.10.22	 We have been sprinkled ⌊with his blood⌋ to free us from a guilty conscience, and our bodies have been washed with clean water. So we must continue to come ⌊to him⌋ with a sincere heart and strong faith. 
HEB.10.23	 We must continue to hold firmly to our declaration of faith. The one who made the promise is faithful.
HEB.10.24	 We must also consider how to encourage each other to show love and to do good things. 
HEB.10.25	 We should not stop gathering together with other believers, as some of you are doing. Instead, we must continue to encourage each other even more as we see the day of the Lord coming.
HEB.10.26	 If we go on sinning after we have learned the truth, no sacrifice can take away our sins. 
HEB.10.27	 All that is left is a terrifying wait for judgment and a raging fire that will consume God’s enemies. 
HEB.10.28	 If two or three witnesses accused someone of rejecting Moses’ Teachings, that person was shown no mercy as he was executed. 
HEB.10.29	 What do you think a person who shows no respect for the Son of God deserves? That person looks at the blood of the promise (the blood that made him holy) as no different from other people’s blood, and he insults the Spirit that God gave us out of his kindness.
HEB.10.30	 We know the God who said,
HEB.10.30	“I alone have the right to take revenge.
HEB.10.30	I will pay back.”
HEB.10.30	God also said,
HEB.10.30	“The Lord will judge his people.”
HEB.10.31	 Falling into the hands of the living God is a terrifying thing.
HEB.10.32	 Remember the past, when you first learned the truth. You endured a lot of hardship and pain. 
HEB.10.33	 At times you were publicly insulted and mistreated. At times you associated with people who were treated this way. 
HEB.10.34	 You suffered with prisoners. You were cheerful even though your possessions were stolen, since you know that you have a better and more permanent possession.
HEB.10.35	 So don’t lose your confidence. It will bring you a great reward. 
HEB.10.36	 You need endurance so that after you have done what God wants you to do, you can receive what he has promised.
HEB.10.37	 “Yet, the one who is coming will come soon. He will not delay.
HEB.10.38	 The person who has God’s approval will live by faith.
HEB.10.38	But if he turns back, I will not be pleased with him.”
HEB.10.39	 We don’t belong with those who turn back and are destroyed. Instead, we belong with those who have faith and are saved.
HEB.11.1	 Faith assures us of things we expect and convinces us of the existence of things we cannot see. 
HEB.11.2	 God accepted our ancestors because of their faith.
HEB.11.3	 Faith convinces us that God created the world through his word. This means what can be seen was made by something that could not be seen.
HEB.11.4	 Faith led Abel to offer God a better sacrifice than Cain’s sacrifice. Through his faith Abel received God’s approval, since God accepted his sacrifices. Through his faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead.
HEB.11.5	 Faith enabled Enoch to be taken instead of dying. No one could find him, because God had taken him. Scripture states that before Enoch was taken, God was pleased with him. 
HEB.11.6	 No one can please God without faith. Whoever goes to God must believe that God exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
HEB.11.7	 Faith led Noah to listen when God warned him about the things in the future that he could not see. He obeyed God and built a ship to save his family. Through faith Noah condemned the world and received God’s approval that comes through faith.
HEB.11.8	 Faith led Abraham to obey when God called him to go to a place that he would receive as an inheritance. Abraham left his own country without knowing where he was going.
HEB.11.9	 Faith led Abraham to live as a foreigner in the country that God had promised him. He lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who received the same promise from God. 
HEB.11.10	 Abraham was waiting for the city that God had designed and built, the city with permanent foundations.
HEB.11.11	 Faith enabled Abraham to become a father, even though he was old and Sarah had never been able to have children. Abraham trusted that God would keep his promise. 
HEB.11.12	 Abraham was as good as dead. Yet, from this man came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the grains of sand on the seashore.
HEB.11.13	 All these people died having faith. They didn’t receive the things that God had promised them, but they saw these things coming in the distant future and rejoiced. They acknowledged that they were living as strangers with no permanent home on earth. 
HEB.11.14	 Those who say such things make it clear that they are looking for their own country. 
HEB.11.15	 If they had been thinking about the country that they had left, they could have found a way to go back. 
HEB.11.16	 Instead, these men were longing for a better country—a heavenly country. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God. He has prepared a city for them.
HEB.11.17	 When God tested Abraham, faith led him to offer his son Isaac. Abraham, the one who received the promises from God, was willing to offer his only son as a sacrifice. 
HEB.11.18	 God had said to him, “Through Isaac your descendants will carry on your name.” 
HEB.11.19	 Abraham believed that God could bring Isaac back from the dead. Abraham did receive Isaac back from the dead in a figurative sense.
HEB.11.20	 Faith led Isaac to bless Jacob and Esau.
HEB.11.21	 While Jacob was dying, faith led him to bless each of Joseph’s sons. He leaned on the top of his staff and worshiped God.
HEB.11.22	 While Joseph was dying, faith led him to speak about the Israelites leaving Egypt and give them instructions about burying his bones.
HEB.11.23	 Faith led Moses’ parents to hide him for three months after he was born. They did this because they saw that Moses was a beautiful baby and they were not afraid to disobey the king’s order.
HEB.11.24	 When Moses grew up, faith led him to refuse to be known as a son of Pharaoh’s daughter. 
HEB.11.25	 He chose to suffer with God’s people rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a little while. 
HEB.11.26	 He thought that being insulted for Christ would be better than having the treasures of Egypt. He was looking ahead to his reward.
HEB.11.27	 Faith led Moses to leave Egypt without being afraid of the king’s anger. Moses didn’t give up but continued as if he could actually see the invisible God.
HEB.11.28	 Faith led Moses to establish the Passover and spread the blood ⌊on the doorposts⌋ so that the destroying angel would not kill the firstborn sons.
HEB.11.29	 Faith caused the people to go through the Red Sea as if it were dry land. The Egyptians also tried this, but they drowned.
HEB.11.30	 Faith caused the walls of Jericho to fall after the Israelites marched around them for seven days.
HEB.11.31	 Faith led the prostitute Rahab to welcome the spies as friends. She was not killed with those who refused to obey God.
HEB.11.32	 What more should I say? I don’t have enough time to tell you about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets. 
HEB.11.33	 Through faith they conquered kingdoms, did what God approved, and received what God had promised. They shut the mouths of lions, 
HEB.11.34	 put out raging fires, and escaped death. They found strength when they were weak. They were powerful in battle and defeated other armies. 
HEB.11.35	 Women received their loved ones back from the dead. Other believers were brutally tortured but refused to be released so that they might gain eternal life. 
HEB.11.36	 Some were made fun of and whipped, and some were chained and put in prison. 
HEB.11.37	 Some were stoned to death, sawed in half, and killed with swords. Some wore the skins of sheep and goats. Some were poor, abused, and mistreated. 
HEB.11.38	 The world didn’t deserve these good people. Some wandered around in deserts and mountains and lived in caves and holes in the ground.
HEB.11.39	 All these people were known for their faith, but none of them received what God had promised. 
HEB.11.40	 God planned to give us something very special so that we would gain eternal life with them.
HEB.12.1	 Since we are surrounded by so many examples ⌊of faith⌋, we must get rid of everything that slows us down, especially sin that distracts us. We must run the race that lies ahead of us and never give up. 
HEB.12.2	 We must focus on Jesus, the source and goal of our faith. He saw the joy ahead of him, so he endured death on the cross and ignored the disgrace it brought him. Then he received the highest position in heaven, the one next to the throne of God. 
HEB.12.3	 Think about Jesus, who endured opposition from sinners, so that you don’t become tired and give up.
HEB.12.4	 You struggle against sin, but your struggles haven’t killed you. 
HEB.12.5	 You have forgotten the encouraging words that God speaks to you as his children:
HEB.12.5	“My child, pay attention when the Lord disciplines you.
HEB.12.5	Don’t give up when he corrects you.
HEB.12.6	 The Lord disciplines everyone he loves.
HEB.12.6	He severely disciplines everyone he accepts as his child.”
HEB.12.7	 Endure your discipline. God corrects you as a father corrects his children. All children are disciplined by their fathers. 
HEB.12.8	 If you aren’t disciplined like the other children, you aren’t part of the family. 
HEB.12.9	 On earth we have fathers who disciplined us, and we respect them. Shouldn’t we place ourselves under the authority of God, the father of spirits, so that we will live? 
HEB.12.10	 For a short time our fathers disciplined us as they thought best. Yet, God disciplines us for our own good so that we can become holy like him. 
HEB.12.11	 We don’t enjoy being disciplined. It always seems to cause more pain than joy. But later on, those who learn from that discipline have peace that comes from doing what is right.
HEB.12.12	 Strengthen your tired arms and weak knees. 
HEB.12.13	 Keep walking along straight paths so that your injured leg won’t get worse. Instead, let it heal.
HEB.12.14	 Try to live peacefully with everyone, and try to live holy lives, because if you don’t, you will not see the Lord. 
HEB.12.15	 Make sure that everyone has kindness 
HEB.12.16	 Make sure that no one commits sexual sin or is as concerned about earthly things as Esau was. He sold his rights as the firstborn son for a single meal. 
HEB.12.17	 You know that afterwards, when he wanted to receive the blessing that the firstborn son was to receive, he was rejected. Even though he begged and cried for the blessing, he couldn’t do anything to change what had happened.
HEB.12.18	 You have not come to something that you can feel, to a blazing fire, to darkness, to gloom, to a storm, 
HEB.12.19	 to a trumpet’s blast, and to a voice. When your ancestors heard that voice, they begged not to hear it say another word. 
HEB.12.20	 They couldn’t obey the command that was given, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death.” 
HEB.12.21	 The sight was so terrifying that even Moses said he was trembling and afraid.
HEB.12.22	 Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to tens of thousands of angels joyfully gathered together 
HEB.12.23	 and to the assembly of God’s firstborn children (whose names are written in heaven). You have come to a judge (the God of all people) and to the spirits of people who have God’s approval and have gained eternal life. 
HEB.12.24	 You have come to Jesus, who brings the new promise 
HEB.12.25	 Be careful that you do not refuse to listen when God speaks. Your ancestors didn’t escape when they refused to listen to God, who warned them on earth. We certainly won’t escape if we turn away from God, who warns us from heaven. 
HEB.12.26	 When God spoke to your ancestors, his voice shook the earth. But now he has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the sky.”
HEB.12.27	 The words 
HEB.12.28	 Therefore, we must be thankful that we have a kingdom that cannot be shaken. Because we are thankful, we must serve God with fear and awe in a way that pleases him. 
HEB.12.29	 After all, our God is a destructive fire.
HEB.13.1	 Continue to love each other. 
HEB.13.2	 Don’t forget to show hospitality to believers you don’t know. By doing this some believers have shown hospitality to angels without being aware of it. 
HEB.13.3	 Remember those in prison as if you were in prison with them. Remember those who are mistreated as if you were being mistreated.
HEB.13.4	 Marriage is honorable in every way, so husbands and wives should be faithful to each other. God will judge those who commit sexual sins, especially those who commit adultery.
HEB.13.5	 Don’t love money. Be happy with what you have because God has said, “I will never abandon you or leave you.” 
HEB.13.6	 So we can confidently say,
HEB.13.6	“The Lord is my helper.
HEB.13.6	I will not be afraid.
HEB.13.6	What can mortals do to me?”
HEB.13.7	 Remember your leaders who have spoken God’s word to you. Think about how their lives turned out, and imitate their faith.
HEB.13.8	 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
HEB.13.9	 Don’t get carried away by all kinds of unfamiliar teachings. Gaining inner strength from God’s kindness 
HEB.13.10	 Those who serve at the tent have no right to eat what is sacrificed at our altar.
HEB.13.11	 The chief priest brings the blood of animals into the holy place as an offering for sin. But the bodies of those animals were burned outside the Israelite camp. 
HEB.13.12	 That is why Jesus suffered outside the gates of Jerusalem. He suffered to make the people holy with his own blood. 
HEB.13.13	 So we must go to him outside the camp and endure the insults he endured. 
HEB.13.14	 We don’t have a permanent city here on earth, but we are looking for the city that we will have in the future. 
HEB.13.15	 Through Jesus we should always bring God a sacrifice of praise, that is, words that acknowledge him. 
HEB.13.16	 Don’t forget to do good things for others and to share what you have with them. These are the kinds of sacrifices that please God.
HEB.13.17	 Obey your leaders, and accept their authority. They take care of you because they are responsible for you. Obey them so that they may do this work joyfully and not complain about you. (Causing them to complain would not be to your advantage.)
HEB.13.18	 Pray for us. We are sure that our consciences are clear because we want to live honorably in every way. 
HEB.13.19	 I especially ask for your prayers so that I may come back to you soon.
HEB.13.20	 The God of peace brought the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus, back to life through the blood of an eternal promise.
HEB.13.21	 May this God of peace prepare you to do every good thing he wants. May he work in us through Jesus Christ to do what is pleasing to him. Glory belongs to Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
HEB.13.22	 I urge you, brothers and sisters, to listen patiently to my encouraging words. I have written you a short letter. 
HEB.13.23	 You know that Timothy, our brother, has been freed. If he comes here soon, both of us will visit you.
HEB.13.24	 Greet all your leaders and all God’s holy people. Those who are with us from Italy greet you.
HEB.13.25	 May God’s good will 
JAS.1.1	 From James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
JAS.1.1	To God’s faithful people 
JAS.1.1	Greetings.
JAS.1.2	 My brothers and sisters, be very happy when you are tested in different ways. 
JAS.1.3	 You know that such testing of your faith produces endurance. 
JAS.1.4	 Endure until your testing is over. Then you will be mature and complete, and you won’t need anything.
JAS.1.5	 If any of you needs wisdom to know what you should do, you should ask God, and he will give it to you. God is generous to everyone and doesn’t find fault with them. 
JAS.1.6	 When you ask for something, don’t have any doubts. A person who has doubts is like a wave that is blown by the wind and tossed by the sea. 
JAS.1.7	 A person who has doubts shouldn’t expect to receive anything from the Lord. 
JAS.1.8	 A person who has doubts is thinking about two different things at the same time and can’t make up his mind about anything.
JAS.1.9	 Humble believers should be proud because being humble makes them important. 
JAS.1.10	 Rich believers should be proud because being rich should make them humble. Rich people will wither like flowers. 
JAS.1.11	 The sun rises with its scorching heat and dries up plants. The flowers drop off, and the beauty is gone. The same thing will happen to rich people. While they are busy, they will die.
JAS.1.12	 Blessed are those who endure when they are tested. When they pass the test, they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. 
JAS.1.13	 When someone is tempted, he shouldn’t say that God is tempting him. God can’t be tempted by evil, and God doesn’t tempt anyone. 
JAS.1.14	 Everyone is tempted by his own desires as they lure him away and trap him. 
JAS.1.15	 Then desire becomes pregnant and gives birth to sin. When sin grows up, it gives birth to death.
JAS.1.16	 My dear brothers and sisters, don’t be fooled. 
JAS.1.17	 Every good present and every perfect gift comes from above, from the Father who made the sun, moon, and stars. The Father doesn’t change like the shifting shadows produced by the sun and the moon.
JAS.1.18	 God decided to give us life through the word of truth to make us his most important creatures.
JAS.1.19	 Remember this, my dear brothers and sisters: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and should not get angry easily. 
JAS.1.20	 An angry person doesn’t do what God approves of. 
JAS.1.21	 So get rid of all immoral behavior and all the wicked things you do. Humbly accept the word that God has placed in you. This word can save you.
JAS.1.22	 Do what God’s word says. Don’t merely listen to it, or you will fool yourselves. 
JAS.1.23	 If someone listens to God’s word but doesn’t do what it says, he is like a person who looks at his face in a mirror, 
JAS.1.24	 studies his features, goes away, and immediately forgets what he looks like. 
JAS.1.25	 However, the person who continues to study God’s perfect laws that make people free and who remains committed to them will be blessed. People like that don’t merely listen and forget; they actually do what God’s laws say.
JAS.1.26	 If a person thinks that he is religious but can’t control his tongue, he is fooling himself. That person’s religion is worthless. 
JAS.1.27	 Pure, unstained religion, according to God our Father, is to take care of orphans and widows when they suffer and to remain uncorrupted by this world.
JAS.2.1	 My brothers and sisters, practice your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ by not favoring one person over another. 
JAS.2.2	 For example, two men come to your worship service. One man is wearing gold rings and fine clothes; the other man, who is poor, is wearing shabby clothes. 
JAS.2.3	 Suppose you give special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say to him, “Please have a seat.” But you say to the poor man, “Stand over there,” or “Sit on the floor at my feet.” 
JAS.2.4	 Aren’t you discriminating against people and using a corrupt standard to make judgments?
JAS.2.5	 Listen, my dear brothers and sisters! Didn’t God choose poor people in the world to become rich in faith and to receive the kingdom that he promised to those who love him? 
JAS.2.6	 Yet, you show no respect to poor people. Don’t rich people oppress you and drag you into court? 
JAS.2.7	 Don’t they curse the good name ⌊of Jesus⌋, the name that was used to bless you?
JAS.2.8	 You are doing right if you obey this law from the highest authority: “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” 
JAS.2.9	 If you favor one person over another, you’re sinning, and this law convicts you of being disobedient. 
JAS.2.10	 If someone obeys all of God’s laws except one, that person is guilty of breaking all of them. 
JAS.2.11	 After all, the one who said, “Never commit adultery,” is the same one who said, “Never murder.” If you do not commit adultery but you murder, you become a person who disobeys God’s laws.
JAS.2.12	 Talk and act as people who are going to be judged by laws that bring freedom. 
JAS.2.13	 No mercy will be shown to those who show no mercy to others. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
JAS.2.14	 My brothers and sisters, what good does it do if someone claims to have faith but doesn’t do any good things? Can this kind of faith save him? 
JAS.2.15	 Suppose a believer, whether a man or a woman, needs clothes or food 
JAS.2.16	 and one of you tells that person, “God be with you! Stay warm, and make sure you eat enough.” If you don’t provide for that person’s physical needs, what good does it do? 
JAS.2.17	 In the same way, faith by itself is dead if it doesn’t cause you to do any good things.
JAS.2.18	 Another person might say, “You have faith, but I do good things.” Show me your faith apart from the good things you do. I will show you my faith by the good things I do. 
JAS.2.19	 You believe that there is one God. That’s fine! The demons also believe that, and they tremble with fear.
JAS.2.20	 You fool! Do you have to be shown that faith which does nothing is useless? 
JAS.2.21	 Didn’t our ancestor Abraham receive God’s approval as a result of what he did when he offered his son Isaac as a sacrifice on the altar? 
JAS.2.22	 You see that Abraham’s faith and what he did worked together. His faith was shown to be genuine by what he did. 
JAS.2.23	 The Scripture passage came true. It says, “Abraham believed God, and that faith was regarded as the basis of Abraham’s approval by God.” So Abraham was called God’s friend. 
JAS.2.24	 You see that a person receives God’s approval because of what he does, not only because of what he believes. 
JAS.2.25	 The same is true of the prostitute Rahab who welcomed the spies and sent them away on another road. She received God’s approval because of what she did.
JAS.2.26	 A body that doesn’t breathe 
JAS.3.1	 Brothers and sisters, not many of you should become teachers. You know that we who teach will be judged more severely.
JAS.3.2	 All of us make a lot of mistakes. If someone doesn’t make any mistakes when he speaks, he would be perfect. He would be able to control everything he does. 
JAS.3.3	 We put bits in the mouths of horses to make them obey us, and we have control over everything they do. 
JAS.3.4	 The same thing is true for ships. They are very big and are driven by strong winds. Yet, by using small rudders, pilots steer ships wherever they want them to go. 
JAS.3.5	 In the same way the tongue is a small part of the body, but it can brag about doing important things.
JAS.3.5	A large forest can be set on fire by a little flame. 
JAS.3.6	 The tongue is that kind of flame. It is a world of evil among the parts of our bodies, and it completely contaminates our bodies. The tongue sets our lives on fire, and is itself set on fire from hell. 
JAS.3.7	 People have tamed all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures. 
JAS.3.8	 Yet, no one can tame the tongue. It is an uncontrollable evil filled with deadly poison.
JAS.3.9	 With our tongues we praise our Lord and Father. Yet, with the same tongues we curse people, who were created in God’s likeness. 
JAS.3.10	 Praise and curses come from the same mouth. My brothers and sisters, this should not happen! 
JAS.3.11	 Do clean and polluted water flow out of the same spring? 
JAS.3.12	 My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree produce olives? Can a grapevine produce figs? In the same way, a pool of salt water can’t produce fresh water.
JAS.3.13	 Do any of you have wisdom and insight? Show this by living the right way with the humility that comes from wisdom. 
JAS.3.14	 But if you are bitterly jealous and filled with self-centered ambition, don’t brag. Don’t say that you are wise when it isn’t true. 
JAS.3.15	 That kind of wisdom doesn’t come from above. It belongs to this world. It is self-centered and demonic. 
JAS.3.16	 Wherever there is jealousy and rivalry, there is disorder and every kind of evil.
JAS.3.17	 However, the wisdom that comes from above is first of all pure. Then it is peaceful, gentle, obedient, filled with mercy and good deeds, impartial, and sincere. 
JAS.3.18	 A harvest that has God’s approval comes from the peace planted by peacemakers.
JAS.4.1	 What causes fights and quarrels among you? Aren’t they caused by the selfish desires that fight to control you? 
JAS.4.2	 You want what you don’t have, so you commit murder. You’re determined to have things, but you can’t get what you want. You quarrel and fight. You don’t have the things you want, because you don’t pray for them. 
JAS.4.3	 When you pray for things, you don’t get them because you want them for the wrong reason—for your own pleasure.
JAS.4.4	 You unfaithful people! Don’t you know that love for this ⌊evil⌋ world is hatred toward God? Whoever wants to be a friend of this world is an enemy of God. 
JAS.4.5	 Do you think this passage means nothing? It says, “The Spirit that lives in us wants us to be his own.”
JAS.4.6	 But God shows us even more kindness.
JAS.4.6	“God opposes arrogant people,
JAS.4.6	but he is kind to humble people.”
JAS.4.7	 So place yourselves under God’s authority. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you. 
JAS.4.8	 Come close to God, and he will come close to you. Clean up your lives, you sinners, and clear your minds, you doubters. 
JAS.4.9	 Be miserable, mourn, and cry. Turn your laughter into mourning and your joy into gloom. 
JAS.4.10	 Humble yourselves in the Lord’s presence. Then he will give you a high position.
JAS.4.11	 Brothers and sisters, stop slandering each other. Those who slander and judge other believers slander and judge God’s laws. If you judge God’s teachings, you are no longer following them. Instead, you are judging them. 
JAS.4.12	 There is only one who creates laws and judges on the basis of them. He is able to save or destroy you. So who are you to judge your neighbor?
JAS.4.13	 Pay attention to this! You’re saying, “Today or tomorrow we will go into some city, stay there a year, conduct business, and make money.” 
JAS.4.14	 You don’t know what will happen tomorrow. What is life? You are a mist that is seen for a moment and then disappears. 
JAS.4.15	 Instead, you should say, “If the Lord wants us to, we will live and carry out our plans.” 
JAS.4.16	 However, you brag because you’re arrogant. All such bragging is evil.
JAS.4.17	 Whoever knows what is right but doesn’t do it is sinning.
JAS.5.1	 Pay attention to this if you’re rich. Cry and moan about the misery that is coming to you. 
JAS.5.2	 Your riches have decayed, and your clothes have been eaten by moths. 
JAS.5.3	 Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be used as evidence against you. Like fire, it will destroy your body.
JAS.5.3	You have stored up riches in these last days. 
JAS.5.4	 The wages you refused to pay the people who harvested your fields shout ⌊to God⌋ against you. The Lord of Armies has heard the cries of those who gather the crops. 
JAS.5.5	 You have lived in luxury and pleasure here on earth. You have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter. 
JAS.5.6	 You have condemned and murdered people who have God’s approval, even though they didn’t resist you.
JAS.5.7	 Brothers and sisters, be patient until the Lord comes again. See how farmers wait for their precious crops to grow. They wait patiently for fall and spring rains. 
JAS.5.8	 You, too, must be patient. Don’t give up hope. The Lord will soon be here. 
JAS.5.9	 Brothers and sisters, stop complaining about each other, or you will be condemned. Realize that the judge is standing at the door.
JAS.5.10	 Brothers and sisters, follow the example of the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. They were patient when they suffered unjustly. 
JAS.5.11	 We consider those who endure to be blessed. You have heard about Job’s endurance. You saw that the Lord ended Job’s suffering because the Lord is compassionate and merciful.
JAS.5.12	 Above all things, my brothers and sisters, do not take an oath on anything in heaven or on earth. Do not take any oath. If you mean yes, say yes. If you mean no, say no. Do this so that you won’t be condemned.
JAS.5.13	 If any of you are having trouble, pray. If you are happy, sing psalms. 
JAS.5.14	 If you are sick, call for the church leaders. Have them pray for you and anoint you with olive oil 
JAS.5.15	 (Prayers offered in faith will save those who are sick, and the Lord will cure them.) If you have sinned, you will be forgiven. 
JAS.5.16	 So admit your sins to each other, and pray for each other so that you will be healed.
JAS.5.16	Prayers offered by those who have God’s approval are effective. 
JAS.5.17	 Elijah was human like us. Yet, when he prayed that it wouldn’t rain, no rain fell on the ground for three-and-a-half years. 
JAS.5.18	 Then he prayed again. It rained, and the ground produced crops.
JAS.5.19	 My brothers and sisters, if one of you wanders from the truth, someone can bring that person back. 
JAS.5.20	 Realize that whoever brings a sinner back from the error of his ways will save him from death, and many sins will be forgiven.
1PE.1.1	 From Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ.
1PE.1.1	To God’s chosen people who are temporary residents ⌊in the world⌋ and are scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. 
1PE.1.2	 God the Father knew you long ago and chose you to live holy lives with the Spirit’s help so that you are obedient to Jesus Christ and are sprinkled with his blood.
1PE.1.2	May good will 
1PE.1.3	 Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! God has given us a new birth because of his great mercy. We have been born into a new life that has a confidence which is alive because Jesus Christ has come back to life. 
1PE.1.4	 We have been born into a new life which has an inheritance that can’t be destroyed or corrupted and can’t fade away. That inheritance is kept in heaven for you, 
1PE.1.5	 since you are guarded by God’s power through faith for a salvation that is ready to be revealed at the end of time.
1PE.1.6	 You are extremely happy about these things, even though you have to suffer different kinds of trouble for a little while now. 
1PE.1.7	 The purpose of these troubles is to test your faith as fire tests how genuine gold is. Your faith is more precious than gold, and by passing the test, it gives praise, glory, and honor to God. This will happen when Jesus Christ appears again.
1PE.1.8	 Although you have never seen Christ, you love him. You don’t see him now, but you believe in him. You are extremely happy with joy and praise that can hardly be expressed in words 
1PE.1.9	 as you obtain the salvation that is the goal of your faith.
1PE.1.10	 The prophets carefully researched and investigated this salvation. Long ago they spoke about God’s kindness 
1PE.1.11	 So they tried to find out what time or situation the Spirit of Christ kept referring to whenever he predicted Christ’s sufferings and the glory that would follow. 
1PE.1.12	 God revealed to the prophets that the things they had spoken were not for their own benefit but for yours. What the prophets had spoken, the Holy Spirit, who was sent from heaven, has now made known to you by those who spread the Good News among you. These are things that even the angels want to look into.
1PE.1.13	 Therefore, your minds must be clear and ready for action. Place your confidence completely in what God’s kindness will bring you when Jesus Christ appears again. 
1PE.1.14	 Because you are children who obey God, don’t live the kind of lives you once lived. Once you lived to satisfy your desires because you didn’t know any better. 
1PE.1.15	 But because the God who called you is holy, you must be holy in every aspect of your life. 
1PE.1.16	 Scripture says, “Be holy, because I am holy.” 
1PE.1.17	 So if you call God your Father, live your time as temporary residents on earth in fear. He is the God who judges all people by what they have done, and he doesn’t play favorites. 
1PE.1.18	 Realize that you weren’t set free from the worthless life handed down to you from your ancestors by a payment of silver or gold which can be destroyed. 
1PE.1.19	 Rather, the payment that freed you was the precious blood of Christ, the lamb with no defects or imperfections. 
1PE.1.20	 He is the lamb who was known long ago before the world existed, but for your good he became publicly known in the last period of time. 
1PE.1.21	 Through him you believe in God who brought Christ back to life and gave him glory. So your faith and confidence are in God.
1PE.1.22	 Love each other with a warm love that comes from the heart. After all, you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth. As a result you have a sincere love for each other. 
1PE.1.23	 You have been born again, not from a seed that can be destroyed, but through God’s everlasting word that can’t be destroyed. That’s why ⌊Scripture says⌋,
1PE.1.24	 “All people are like grass,
1PE.1.24	and all their beauty is like a flower of the field.
1PE.1.24	The grass dries up and the flower drops off,
1PE.1.25	 but the word of the Lord lasts forever.”
1PE.1.25	This word is the Good News that was told to you.
1PE.2.1	 So get rid of every kind of evil, every kind of deception, hypocrisy, jealousy, and every kind of slander. 
1PE.2.2	 Desire God’s pure word as newborn babies desire milk. Then you will grow in your salvation. 
1PE.2.3	 Certainly you have tasted that the Lord is good!
1PE.2.4	 You are coming to Christ, the living stone who was rejected by humans but was chosen as precious by God. 
1PE.2.5	 You come to him as living stones, a spiritual house that is being built into a holy priesthood. So offer spiritual sacrifices that God accepts through Jesus Christ. 
1PE.2.6	 That is why Scripture says,
1PE.2.6	“I am laying a chosen and precious cornerstone in Zion,
1PE.2.6	and the person who believes in him
1PE.2.6	will never be ashamed.”
1PE.2.7	 This honor belongs to those who believe. But to those who don’t believe:
1PE.2.7	“The stone that the builders rejected
1PE.2.7	has become the cornerstone,
1PE.2.8	 a stone that people trip over,
1PE.2.8	a large rock that people find offensive.”
1PE.2.8	The people tripped over the word because they refused to believe it. Therefore, this is how they ended up.
1PE.2.9	 However, you are chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, people who belong to God. You were chosen to tell about the excellent qualities of God, who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. 
1PE.2.10	 Once you were not God’s people, but now you are. Once you were not shown mercy, but now you have been shown mercy.
1PE.2.11	 Dear friends, since you are foreigners and temporary residents ⌊in the world⌋, I’m encouraging you to keep away from the desires of your corrupt nature. These desires constantly attack you. 
1PE.2.12	 Live decent lives among unbelievers. Then, although they ridicule you as if you were doing wrong while they are watching you do good things, they will praise God on the day he comes to help you.
1PE.2.13	 Place yourselves under the authority of human governments to please the Lord. Obey the emperor. He holds the highest position of authority. 
1PE.2.14	 Also obey governors. They are people the emperor has sent to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right. 
1PE.2.15	 God wants you to silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right. 
1PE.2.16	 Live as free people, but don’t hide behind your freedom when you do evil. Instead, use your freedom to serve God. 
1PE.2.17	 Honor everyone. Love your brothers and sisters in the faith. Fear God. Honor the emperor.
1PE.2.18	 Slaves, place yourselves under the authority of your owners and show them complete respect. Obey not only those owners who are good and kind, but also those who are unfair. 
1PE.2.19	 God is pleased if a person is aware of him while enduring the pains of unjust suffering. 
1PE.2.20	 What credit do you deserve if you endure a beating for doing something wrong? But if you endure suffering for doing something good, God is pleased with you.
1PE.2.21	 God called you to endure suffering because Christ suffered for you. He left you an example so that you could follow in his footsteps. 
1PE.2.22	 Christ never committed any sin. He never spoke deceitfully. 
1PE.2.23	 Christ never verbally abused those who verbally abused him. When he suffered, he didn’t make any threats but left everything to the one who judges fairly. 
1PE.2.24	 Christ carried our sins in his body on the cross so that freed from our sins, we could live a life that has God’s approval. His wounds have healed you. 
1PE.2.25	 You were like lost sheep. Now you have come back to the shepherd and bishop 
1PE.3.1	 Wives, in a similar way, place yourselves under your husbands’ authority. Some husbands may not obey God’s word. Their wives could win these men ⌊for Christ⌋ by the way they live without saying anything. 
1PE.3.2	 Their husbands would see how pure and reverent their lives are.
1PE.3.3	 Wives must not let their beauty be something external. Beauty doesn’t come from hairstyles, gold jewelry, or clothes. 
1PE.3.4	 Rather, beauty is something internal that can’t be destroyed. Beauty expresses itself in a gentle and quiet attitude which God considers precious. 
1PE.3.5	 After all, this is how holy women who had confidence in God expressed their beauty in the past. They placed themselves under their husbands’ authority 
1PE.3.6	 as Sarah did. Sarah obeyed Abraham and spoke to him respectfully. You became Sarah’s daughters by not letting anything make you afraid to do good.
1PE.3.7	 Husbands, in a similar way, live with your wives with understanding since they are weaker than you are. Honor your wives as those who share God’s life-giving kindness 
1PE.3.8	 Finally, everyone must live in harmony, be sympathetic, love each other, have compassion, and be humble. 
1PE.3.9	 Don’t pay people back with evil for the evil they do to you, or ridicule those who ridicule you. Instead, bless them, because you were called to inherit a blessing.
1PE.3.10	 “People who want to live a full life and enjoy good days
1PE.3.10	must keep their tongues from saying evil things,
1PE.3.10	and their lips from speaking deceitful things.
1PE.3.11	 They must turn away from evil and do good.
1PE.3.11	They must seek peace and pursue it.
1PE.3.12	 The Lord’s eyes are on those who do what he approves.
1PE.3.12	His ears hear their prayer.
1PE.3.12	The Lord confronts those who do evil.”
1PE.3.13	 Who will harm you if you are devoted to doing what is good? 
1PE.3.14	 But even if you suffer for doing what God approves, you are blessed. Don’t be afraid of those who want to harm you. Don’t get upset. 
1PE.3.15	 But dedicate your lives to Christ as Lord. Always be ready to defend your confidence ⌊in God⌋ when anyone asks you to explain it. However, make your defense with gentleness and respect. 
1PE.3.16	 Keep your conscience clear. Then those who treat the good Christian life you live with contempt will feel ashamed that they have ridiculed you. 
1PE.3.17	 After all, if it is God’s will, it’s better to suffer for doing good than for doing wrong.
1PE.3.18	 This is true because Christ suffered for our sins once. He was an innocent person, but he suffered for guilty people so that he could bring you to God. His body was put to death, but he was brought to life through his spirit. 
1PE.3.19	 In it he also went to proclaim his victory to the spirits kept in prison. 
1PE.3.20	 They are like those who disobeyed long ago in the days of Noah when God waited patiently while Noah built the ship. In this ship a few people—eight in all—were saved by water. 
1PE.3.21	 Baptism, which is like that water, now saves you. Baptism doesn’t save by removing dirt from the body. Rather, baptism is a request to God for a clear conscience. It saves you through Jesus Christ, who came back from death to life. 
1PE.3.22	 Christ has gone to heaven where he has the highest position that God gives. Angels, rulers, and powers have been placed under his authority.
1PE.4.1	 Since Christ has suffered physically, take the same attitude that he had. (A person who has suffered physically no longer sins.) 
1PE.4.2	 That way you won’t be guided by sinful human desires as you live the rest of your lives on earth. Instead, you will be guided by what God wants you to do. 
1PE.4.3	 You spent enough time in the past doing what unbelievers like to do. You were promiscuous, had sinful desires, got drunk, went to wild parties, and took part in the forbidden worship of false gods. 
1PE.4.4	 Unbelievers insult you now because they are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of wild living. 
1PE.4.5	 They will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
1PE.4.6	 After all, the Good News was told to people like that, although they are now dead. It was told to them so that they could be judged like humans in their earthly lives and live like God in their spiritual lives.
1PE.4.7	 The end of everything is near. Therefore, practice self-control, and keep your minds clear so that you can pray. 
1PE.4.8	 Above all, love each other warmly, because love covers many sins. 
1PE.4.9	 Welcome each other as guests without complaining. 
1PE.4.10	 Each of you as a good manager must use the gift that God has given you to serve others. 
1PE.4.11	 Whoever speaks must speak God’s words. Whoever serves must serve with the strength God supplies so that in every way God receives glory through Jesus Christ. Glory and power belong to Jesus Christ forever and ever! Amen.
1PE.4.12	 Dear friends, don’t be surprised by the fiery troubles that are coming in order to test you. Don’t feel as though something strange is happening to you, 
1PE.4.13	 but be happy as you share Christ’s sufferings. Then you will also be full of joy when he appears again in his glory. 
1PE.4.14	 If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed because the Spirit of glory—the Spirit of God—is resting on you.
1PE.4.15	 If you suffer, you shouldn’t suffer for being a murderer, thief, criminal, or troublemaker. 
1PE.4.16	 If you suffer for being a Christian, don’t feel ashamed, but praise God for being called that name. 
1PE.4.17	 The time has come for the judgment to begin, and it will begin with God’s family. If it starts with us, what will be the end for those who refuse to obey the Good News of God? 
1PE.4.18	 If it’s hard for the person who has God’s approval to be saved, what will happen to the godless sinner? 
1PE.4.19	 Those who suffer because that is God’s will for them must entrust themselves to a faithful creator and continue to do what is good.
1PE.5.1	 I appeal to your spiritual leaders.
1PE.5.2	 Be shepherds over the flock God has entrusted to you. Watch over it as God does: Don’t do this because you have to, but because you want to. Don’t do it out of greed, but out of a desire to serve. 
1PE.5.3	 Don’t be rulers over the people entrusted to you, but be examples for the flock to follow. 
1PE.5.4	 Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.
1PE.5.5	 Young people, in a similar way, place yourselves under the authority of spiritual leaders.
1PE.5.5	Furthermore, all of you must serve each other with humility, because God opposes the arrogant but favors the humble. 
1PE.5.6	 Be humbled by God’s power so that when the right time comes he will honor you.
1PE.5.7	 Turn all your anxiety over to God because he cares for you. 
1PE.5.8	 Keep your mind clear, and be alert. Your opponent the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion as he looks for someone to devour. 
1PE.5.9	 Be firm in the faith and resist him, knowing that other believers throughout the world are going through the same kind of suffering. 
1PE.5.10	 God, who shows you his kindness 
1PE.5.11	 Power belongs to him forever. Amen.
1PE.5.12	 I’ve written this short letter to you and I’m sending it by Silvanus, whom I regard as a faithful brother. I’ve written to encourage you and to testify that this is God’s genuine good will.
1PE.5.13	 Your sister church in Babylon, chosen by God, and my son Mark send you greetings. 
1PE.5.14	 Greet each other with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
2PE.1.1	 From Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.1	To those who have obtained a faith that is as valuable as ours, a faith based on the approval that comes from our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.2	 May good will 
2PE.1.3	 God’s divine power has given us everything we need for life and for godliness. This power was given to us through knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and integrity. 
2PE.1.4	 Through his glory and integrity he has given us his promises that are of the highest value. Through these promises you will share in the divine nature because you have escaped the corruption that sinful desires cause in the world.
2PE.1.5	 Because of this, make every effort to add integrity to your faith; and to integrity add knowledge; 
2PE.1.6	 to knowledge add self-control; to self-control add endurance; to endurance add godliness; 
2PE.1.7	 to godliness add Christian affection; and to Christian affection add love. 
2PE.1.8	 If you have these qualities and they are increasing, it demonstrates that your knowledge about our Lord Jesus Christ is living and productive. 
2PE.1.9	 If these qualities aren’t present in your life, you’re shortsighted and have forgotten that you were cleansed from your past sins. 
2PE.1.10	 Therefore, brothers and sisters, use more effort to make God’s calling and choosing of you secure.
2PE.1.10	If you keep doing this, you will never fall away. 
2PE.1.11	 Then you will also be given the wealth of entering into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.12	 Therefore, I will always remind you about these qualities, although you already know about them and are well-grounded in the truth that you now have. 
2PE.1.13	 As long as I’m still alive, I think it’s right to refresh your memory. 
2PE.1.14	 I know that I will die soon. Our Lord Jesus Christ has made that clear to me. 
2PE.1.15	 So I will make every effort to see that you remember these things after I die.
2PE.1.16	 When we apostles told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, we didn’t base our message on clever myths that we made up. Rather, we witnessed his majesty with our own eyes. 
2PE.1.17	 For example, we were eyewitnesses when he received honor and glory from God the Father and when the voice of our majestic God spoke these words to him: “This is my Son, whom I love and in whom I delight.” 
2PE.1.18	 We heard that voice speak to him from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.
2PE.1.19	 So we regard the words of the prophets as confirmed beyond all doubt. You’re doing well by paying attention to their words. Continue to pay attention as you would to a light that shines in a dark place as you wait for day to come and the morning star to rise in your hearts. 
2PE.1.20	 First, you must understand this: No prophecy in Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation. 
2PE.1.21	 No prophecy ever originated from humans. Instead, it was given by the Holy Spirit as humans spoke under God’s direction.
2PE.2.1	 False prophets were among God’s people ⌊in the past⌋, as false teachers will be among you. They will secretly bring in their own destructive teachings. They will deny the Lord, who has bought them, and they will bring themselves swift destruction. 
2PE.2.2	 Many people will follow them in their sexual freedom and will cause others to dishonor the way of truth. 
2PE.2.3	 In their greed they will use good-sounding arguments to exploit you. The verdict against them from long ago is still in force, and their destruction is not asleep.
2PE.2.4	 God didn’t spare angels who sinned. He threw them into hell, where he has secured them with chains of darkness and is holding them for judgment.
2PE.2.5	 God didn’t spare the ancient world either. He brought the flood on the world of ungodly people, but he protected Noah and seven other people. Noah was his messenger who told people about the kind of life that has God’s approval.
2PE.2.6	 God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and destroyed them by burning them to ashes. He made those cities an example to ungodly people of what is going to happen to them. 
2PE.2.7	 Yet, God rescued Lot, a man who had his approval. Lot was distressed by the lifestyle of people who had no principles and lived in sexual freedom. 
2PE.2.8	 Although he was a man who had God’s approval, he lived among the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Each day was like torture to him as he saw and heard the immoral things that people did.
2PE.2.9	 Since the Lord did all this, he knows how to rescue godly people when they are tested. He also knows how to hold immoral people for punishment on the day of judgment. 
2PE.2.10	 This is especially true of those who follow their corrupt nature along the path of impure desires and who despise the Lord’s authority.
2PE.2.10	These false teachers are bold and arrogant. They aren’t afraid to insult the ⌊Lord’s⌋ glory. 
2PE.2.11	 Angels, who have more strength and power than these teachers, don’t bring an insulting judgment against them from the Lord. 
2PE.2.12	 These false teachers insult what they don’t understand. They are like animals, which are creatures of instinct that are born to be caught and killed. So they will be destroyed like animals 
2PE.2.13	 and lose what their wrongdoing earned them.
2PE.2.13	These false teachers are stains and blemishes. They take pleasure in holding wild parties in broad daylight. They especially enjoy deceiving you while they eat with you. 
2PE.2.14	 They’re always looking for an adulterous woman. They can’t stop looking for sin as they seduce people who aren’t sure of what they believe. Their minds are focused on their greed. They are cursed.
2PE.2.15	 These false teachers have left the straight path and wandered off to follow the path of Balaam, son of Beor. Balaam loved what his wrongdoing earned him. 
2PE.2.16	 But he was convicted for his evil. A donkey, which normally can’t talk, spoke with a human voice and wouldn’t allow the prophet to continue his insanity.
2PE.2.17	 These false teachers are dried-up springs. They are a mist blown around by a storm. Gloomy darkness has been kept for them. 
2PE.2.18	 They arrogantly use nonsense to seduce people by appealing to their sexual desires, especially to sexual freedom. They seduce people who have just escaped from those who live in error. 
2PE.2.19	 They promise these people freedom, but they themselves are slaves to corruption. A person is a slave to whatever he gives in to.
2PE.2.20	 People can know our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and escape the world’s filth. But if they get involved in this filth again and give in to it, they are worse off than they were before. 
2PE.2.21	 It would have been better for them never to have known the way of life that God approves of than to know it and turn their backs on the holy life God told them to live. 
2PE.2.22	 These proverbs have come true for them: “A dog goes back to its vomit,” and “A sow that has been washed goes back to roll around in the mud.”
2PE.3.1	 Dear friends, this is the second letter I’m writing to you. In both letters I’m trying to refresh your memory. 
2PE.3.2	 I want you to remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and what the Lord and Savior commanded you through your apostles.
2PE.3.3	 First, you must understand this: In the last days people who follow their own desires will appear. These disrespectful people will ridicule ⌊God’s promise⌋ 
2PE.3.4	 by saying, “What’s happened to his promise to return? Ever since our ancestors died, everything continues as it did from the beginning of the world.”
2PE.3.5	 They are deliberately ignoring one fact: Because of God’s word, heaven and earth existed a long time ago. The earth ⌊appeared⌋ out of water and was kept alive by water. 
2PE.3.6	 Water also flooded and destroyed that world. 
2PE.3.7	 By God’s word, the present heaven and earth are designated to be burned. They are being kept until the day ungodly people will be judged and destroyed.
2PE.3.8	 Dear friends, don’t ignore this fact: One day with the Lord is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. 
2PE.3.9	 The Lord isn’t slow to do what he promised, as some people think. Rather, he is patient for your sake. He doesn’t want to destroy anyone but wants all people to have an opportunity to turn to him and change the way they think and act.
2PE.3.10	 The day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that day heaven will pass away with a roaring sound. Everything that makes up the universe will burn and be destroyed. The earth and everything that people have done on it will be exposed.
2PE.3.11	 All these things will be destroyed in this way. So think of the kind of holy and godly lives you must live 
2PE.3.12	 as you look forward to the day of God and eagerly wait for it to come. When that day comes, heaven will be on fire and will be destroyed. Everything that makes up the universe will burn and melt. 
2PE.3.13	 But we look forward to what God has promised—a new heaven and a new earth—a place where everything that has God’s approval lives.
2PE.3.14	 Therefore, dear friends, with this to look forward to, make every effort to have him find you at peace, without ⌊spiritual⌋ stains or blemishes. 
2PE.3.15	 Think of our Lord’s patience as an opportunity ⌊for us⌋ to be saved. This is what our dear brother Paul wrote to you about, using the wisdom God gave him. 
2PE.3.16	 He talks about this subject in all his letters. Some things in his letters are hard to understand. Ignorant people and people who aren’t sure of what they believe distort what Paul says in his letters the same way they distort the rest of the Scriptures. These people will be destroyed.
2PE.3.17	 Dear friends, you already know these things. So be on your guard not to be carried away by the deception of people who have no principles. Then you won’t fall from your firm position. 
2PE.3.18	 But grow in the good will 
1JN.1.1	 The Word of life existed from the beginning. We have heard it. We have seen it. We observed and touched it. 
1JN.1.2	 This life was revealed to us. We have seen it, and we testify about it. We are reporting to you about this eternal life that was in the presence of the Father and was revealed to us. 
1JN.1.3	 This is the life we have seen and heard. We are reporting about it to you also so that you, too, can have a relationship with us. Our relationship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 
1JN.1.4	 We are writing this so that we can be completely filled with joy.
1JN.1.5	 This is the message we heard from Christ and are reporting to you: God is light, and there isn’t any darkness in him. 
1JN.1.6	 If we say, “We have a relationship with God” and yet live in the dark, we’re lying. We aren’t being truthful.
1JN.1.7	 But if we live in the light in the same way that God is in the light, we have a relationship with each other. And the blood of his Son Jesus cleanses us from every sin. 
1JN.1.8	 If we say, “We aren’t sinful” we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
1JN.1.9	 God is faithful and reliable. If we confess our sins, he forgives them and cleanses us from everything we’ve done wrong. 
1JN.1.10	 If we say, “We have never sinned,” we turn God into a liar and his Word is not in us.
1JN.2.1	 My dear children, I’m writing this to you so that you will not sin. Yet, if anyone does sin, we have Jesus Christ, who has God’s full approval. He speaks on our behalf when we come into the presence of the Father. 
1JN.2.2	 He is the payment for our sins, and not only for our sins, but also for the sins of the whole world.
1JN.2.3	 We are sure that we know Christ if we obey his commandments. 
1JN.2.4	 The person who says, “I know him,” but doesn’t obey his commandments is a liar. The truth isn’t in that person. 
1JN.2.5	 But whoever obeys what Christ says is the kind of person in whom God’s love is perfected. That’s how we know we are in Christ. 
1JN.2.6	 Those who say that they live in him must live the same way he lived.
1JN.2.7	 Dear friends, it’s not as though I’m writing to give you a new commandment. Rather, I’m giving you an old commandment that you’ve had from the beginning. It’s the old commandment you’ve already heard. 
1JN.2.8	 On the other hand, I’m writing to give you a new commandment. It’s a truth that exists in Christ and in you: The darkness is fading, and the true light is already shining.
1JN.2.9	 Those who say that they are in the light but hate other believers are still in the dark. 
1JN.2.10	 Those who love other believers live in the light. Nothing will destroy the faith of those who live in the light. 
1JN.2.11	 Those who hate other believers are in the dark and live in the dark. They don’t know where they’re going, because they can’t see in the dark.
1JN.2.12	 I’m writing to you, dear children, because your sins are forgiven through Christ.
1JN.2.13	 I’m writing to you, fathers, because you know Christ who has existed from the beginning.
1JN.2.13	I’m writing to you, young people, because you have won the victory over the evil one.
1JN.2.14	 I’ve written to you, children, because you know the Father.
1JN.2.14	I’ve written to you, fathers, because you know Christ, who has existed from the beginning.
1JN.2.14	I’ve written to you, young people, because you are strong and God’s word lives in you. You have won the victory over the evil one.
1JN.2.15	 Don’t love the world and what it offers. Those who love the world don’t have the Father’s love in them. 
1JN.2.16	 Not everything that the world offers—physical gratification, greed, and extravagant lifestyles—comes from the Father. It comes from the world, and 
1JN.2.17	 the world and its evil desires are passing away. But the person who does what God wants lives forever.
1JN.2.18	 Children, it’s the end of time. You’ve heard that an antichrist is coming. Certainly, many antichrists are already here. That’s how we know it’s the end of time. 
1JN.2.19	 They left us. However, they were never really part of us. If they had been, they would have stayed with us. But by leaving they made it clear that none of them were part of us.
1JN.2.20	 The Holy One has anointed you, so all of you have knowledge. 
1JN.2.21	 I’m writing to you because you know the truth, not because you don’t know the truth. You know that no lie ever comes from the truth.
1JN.2.22	 Who is a liar? Who else but the person who rejects Jesus as the Messiah? The person who rejects the Father and the Son is an antichrist. 
1JN.2.23	 Everyone who rejects the Son doesn’t have the Father either. The person who acknowledges the Son also has the Father. 
1JN.2.24	 Make sure that the message you heard from the beginning lives in you. If that message lives in you, you will also live in the Son and in the Father. 
1JN.2.25	 Christ has given us the promise of eternal life.
1JN.2.26	 I’m writing to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 
1JN.2.27	 The anointing you received from Christ lives in you. You don’t need anyone to teach you something else. Instead, Christ’s anointing teaches you about everything. His anointing is true and contains no lie. So live in Christ as he taught you to do.
1JN.2.28	 Now, dear children, live in Christ. Then, when he appears we will have confidence, and when he comes we won’t turn from him in shame. 
1JN.2.29	 If you know that Christ has God’s approval, you also know that everyone who does what God approves of has been born from God.
1JN.3.1	 Consider this: The Father has given us his love. He loves us so much that we are actually called God’s dear children. And that’s what we are. For this reason the world doesn’t recognize us, and it didn’t recognize him either. 
1JN.3.2	 Dear friends, now we are God’s children. What we will be isn’t completely clear yet. We do know that when Christ appears we will be like him because we will see him as he is. 
1JN.3.3	 So all people who have this confidence in Christ keep themselves pure, as Christ is pure.
1JN.3.4	 Those who live sinful lives are disobeying God. Sin is disobedience. 
1JN.3.5	 You know that Christ appeared in order to take away our sins. He isn’t sinful. 
1JN.3.6	 Those who live in Christ don’t go on sinning. Those who go on sinning haven’t seen or known Christ.
1JN.3.7	 Dear children, don’t let anyone deceive you. Whoever does what God approves of has God’s approval as Christ has God’s approval. 
1JN.3.8	 The person who lives a sinful life belongs to the devil, because the devil has been committing sin since the beginning. The reason that the Son of God appeared was to destroy what the devil does. 
1JN.3.9	 Those who have been born from God don’t live sinful lives. What God has said lives in them, and they can’t live sinful lives. They have been born from God. 
1JN.3.10	 This is the way God’s children are distinguished from the devil’s children. Everyone who doesn’t do what is right or love other believers isn’t God’s child.
1JN.3.11	 The message that you have heard from the beginning is to love each other. 
1JN.3.12	 Don’t be like Cain. He was a child of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did Cain murder his brother? Because the things Cain did were evil and the things his brother did had God’s approval. 
1JN.3.13	 Brothers and sisters, don’t be surprised if the world hates you.
1JN.3.14	 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love other believers. The person who doesn’t grow in love remains in death. 
1JN.3.15	 Everyone who hates another believer is a murderer, and you know that a murderer doesn’t have eternal life.
1JN.3.16	 We understand what love is when we realize that Christ gave his life for us. That means we must give our lives for other believers. 
1JN.3.17	 Now, suppose a person has enough to live on and notices another believer in need. How can God’s love be in that person if he doesn’t bother to help the other believer? 
1JN.3.18	 Dear children, we must show love through actions that are sincere, not through empty words.
1JN.3.19	 This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and how we will be reassured in his presence. 
1JN.3.20	 Whenever our conscience condemns us, we will be reassured that God is greater than our conscience and knows everything. 
1JN.3.21	 Dear friends, if our conscience doesn’t condemn us, we can boldly look to God 
1JN.3.22	 and receive from him anything we ask. We receive it because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him. 
1JN.3.23	 This is his commandment: to believe in his Son, the one named Jesus Christ, and to love each other as he commanded us. 
1JN.3.24	 Those who obey Christ’s commandments live in God, and God lives in them. We know that he lives in us because he has given us the Spirit.
1JN.4.1	 Dear friends, don’t believe all people who say that they have the Spirit. Instead, test them. See whether the spirit they have is from God, because there are many false prophets in the world. 
1JN.4.2	 This is how you can recognize God’s Spirit: Every person who declares that Jesus Christ has come as a human has the Spirit that is from God. 
1JN.4.3	 But every person who doesn’t declare that Jesus Christ has come as a human has a spirit that isn’t from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist that you have heard is coming. That spirit is already in the world.
1JN.4.4	 Dear children, you belong to God. So you have won the victory over these people, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 
1JN.4.5	 These people belong to the world. That’s why they speak the thoughts of the world, and the world listens to them. 
1JN.4.6	 We belong to God. The person who knows God listens to us. Whoever doesn’t belong to God doesn’t listen to us. That’s how we can tell the Spirit of truth from the spirit of lies.
1JN.4.7	 Dear friends, we must love each other because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born from God and knows God. 
1JN.4.8	 The person who doesn’t love doesn’t know God, because God is love. 
1JN.4.9	 God has shown us his love by sending his only Son into the world so that we could have life through him. 
1JN.4.10	 This is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the payment for our sins. 
1JN.4.11	 Dear friends, if this is the way God loved us, we must also love each other. 
1JN.4.12	 No one has ever seen God. If we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us. 
1JN.4.13	 We know that we live in him and he lives in us because he has given us his Spirit.
1JN.4.14	 We have seen and testify to the fact that the Father sent his Son as the Savior of the world. 
1JN.4.15	 God lives in those who declare that Jesus is the Son of God, and they live in God. 
1JN.4.16	 We have known and believed that God loves us. God is love. Those who live in God’s love live in God, and God lives in them.
1JN.4.17	 God’s love has reached its goal in us. So we look ahead with confidence to the day of judgment. While we are in this world, we are exactly like him ⌊with regard to love⌋. 
1JN.4.18	 No fear exists where his love is. Rather, perfect love gets rid of fear, because fear involves punishment. The person who lives in fear doesn’t have perfect love.
1JN.4.19	 We love because God loved us first. 
1JN.4.20	 Whoever says, “I love God,” but hates another believer is a liar. People who don’t love other believers, whom they have seen, can’t love God, whom they have not seen. 
1JN.4.21	 Christ has given us this commandment: The person who loves God must also love other believers.
1JN.5.1	 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah has been born from God. Everyone who loves the Father also loves his children. 
1JN.5.2	 We know that we love God’s children when we love God by obeying his commandments. 
1JN.5.3	 To love God means that we obey his commandments. Obeying his commandments isn’t difficult 
1JN.5.4	 because everyone who has been born from God has won the victory over the world. Our faith is what wins the victory over the world. 
1JN.5.5	 Who wins the victory over the world? Isn’t it the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
1JN.5.6	 This Son of God is Jesus Christ, who came by water and blood. He didn’t come with water only, but with water and with blood. The Spirit is the one who verifies this, because the Spirit is the truth. 
1JN.5.7	 There are three witnesses: 
1JN.5.8	 the Spirit, the water, and the blood. These three witnesses agree.
1JN.5.9	 We accept human testimony. God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony that he has given about his Son. 
1JN.5.10	 Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony of God in them. Those who don’t believe God have made God a liar. They haven’t believed the testimony that God has given about his Son.
1JN.5.11	 This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is found in his Son. 
1JN.5.12	 The person who has the Son has this life. The person who doesn’t have the Son of God doesn’t have this life.
1JN.5.13	 I’ve written this to those who believe in the Son of God so that they will know that they have eternal life.
1JN.5.14	 We are confident that God listens to us if we ask for anything that has his approval. 
1JN.5.15	 We know that he listens to our requests. So we know that we already have what we ask him for.
1JN.5.16	 If you see another believer committing a sin that doesn’t lead to death, you should pray that God would give that person life. This is true for those who commit sins that don’t lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I’m not telling you to pray about that. 
1JN.5.17	 Every kind of wrongdoing is sin, yet there are sins that don’t lead to death.
1JN.5.18	 We know that those who have been born from God don’t go on sinning. Rather, the Son of God protects them, and the evil one can’t harm them.
1JN.5.19	 We know that we are from God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.
1JN.5.20	 We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we know the real God. We are in the one who is real, his Son Jesus Christ. This Jesus Christ is the real God and eternal life.
1JN.5.21	 Dear children, guard yourselves from false gods.
2JN.1.1	 From the church leader.
2JN.1.1	To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love because we share the truth. I’m not the only one who loves you. Everyone who knows the truth also loves you. 
2JN.1.2	 We love you because of the truth which lives in us and will be with us forever.
2JN.1.3	 Good will,
2JN.1.4	 I was very happy to find some of your children living in the truth as the Father has commanded us. 
2JN.1.5	 Dear lady, I’m now requesting that we continue to love each other. It’s not as though I’m writing to give you a new commandment. Rather, from the beginning we were commanded to love each other. 
2JN.1.6	 Love means that we live by doing what he commands. We were commanded to live in love, and you have heard this from the beginning.
2JN.1.7	 Many people who deceive others have gone into the world. They refuse to declare that Jesus Christ came in flesh and blood. This is the mark of a deceiver and an antichrist. 
2JN.1.8	 Be careful that you don’t destroy what we’ve worked for, but that you receive your full reward.
2JN.1.9	 Everyone who doesn’t continue to teach what Christ taught doesn’t have God. The person who continues to teach what Christ taught has both the Father and the Son. 
2JN.1.10	 If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring these teachings, don’t take him into your home or even greet him. 
2JN.1.11	 Whoever greets him shares the evil things he’s doing.
2JN.1.12	 I have a lot to write to you. I would prefer not to write a letter. Instead, I hope to visit and talk things over with you personally. Then we will be completely filled with joy.
2JN.1.13	 The children of your chosen sister greet you.
3JN.1.1	 From the church leader.
3JN.1.1	To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love because we share the truth.
3JN.1.2	 Dear friend, I know that you are spiritually well. I pray that you’re doing well in every other way and that you’re healthy. 
3JN.1.3	 I was very happy when some believers came and told us that you are living according to the truth. 
3JN.1.4	 Nothing makes me happier than to hear that my children are living according to the truth.
3JN.1.5	 Dear friend, you are showing your faith in whatever you do for other believers, especially when they’re your guests. 
3JN.1.6	 These believers have told the congregation about your love. You will do well to support them on their trip in a way that proves you belong to God. 
3JN.1.7	 After all, they went on their trip to serve the one named Christ, and they didn’t accept any help from the people to whom they went. 
3JN.1.8	 We must support believers who go on trips like this so that we can work together with them in spreading the truth.
3JN.1.9	 I wrote a letter to the congregation. But Diotrephes, who loves to be in charge, won’t accept us. 
3JN.1.10	 For this reason, when I come I will bring up what he’s doing. He’s not satisfied with saying malicious things about us. He also refuses to accept the believers ⌊we send⌋ as guests. He even tries to stop others who want to accept them and attempts to throw those people out of the congregation.
3JN.1.11	 Dear friend, never imitate evil, but imitate good. The person who does good is from God. The person who does evil has never seen God.
3JN.1.12	 Everyone, including the truth itself, says good things about Demetrius. We also say good things about him, and you know that what we say is true.
3JN.1.13	 I have a lot to write to you. However, I would rather not write. 
3JN.1.14	 I hope to visit you very soon. Then we can talk things over personally.
3JN.1.15	 Peace be with you! Your friends here send you their greetings. Greet each of our friends by name.
JUD.1.1	 From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James.
JUD.1.1	To those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father, and who are kept safe for Jesus Christ.
JUD.1.2	 May mercy, peace, and love fill your lives!
JUD.1.3	 Dear friends, I had intended to write to you about the salvation we share. But something has come up. It demands that I write to you and encourage you to continue your fight for the Christian faith that was entrusted to God’s holy people once for all time.
JUD.1.4	 Some people have slipped in among you unnoticed. Not long ago they were condemned in writing for the following reason: They are people to whom God means nothing. They use God’s kindness 
JUD.1.5	 I want to remind you about what you already know: The Lord once saved his people from Egypt. But on another occasion he destroyed those who didn’t believe. 
JUD.1.6	 He held angels for judgment on the great day. They were held in darkness, bound by eternal chains. These are the angels who didn’t keep their position of authority but abandoned their assigned place. 
JUD.1.7	 What happened to Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities near them is an example for us of the punishment of eternal fire. The people of these cities suffered the same fate that God’s people and the angels did, because they committed sexual sins and engaged in homosexual activities.
JUD.1.8	 Yet, in a similar way, the people who slipped in among you are dreamers. They contaminate their bodies with sin, reject the Lord’s authority, and insult his glory. 
JUD.1.9	 When the archangel Michael argued with the devil, they were arguing over the body of Moses. But Michael didn’t dare to hand down a judgment against the devil. Instead, Michael said, “May the Lord reprimand you!”
JUD.1.10	 Whatever these people don’t understand, they insult. Like animals, which are creatures of instinct, they use whatever they know to destroy themselves. 
JUD.1.11	 How horrible it will be for them! They have followed the path of Cain. They have rushed into Balaam’s error to make a profit. They have rebelled like Korah and destroyed themselves.
JUD.1.12	 These people are a disgrace at the special meals you share with other believers. They eat with you and don’t feel ashamed. They are shepherds who care ⌊only⌋ for themselves. They are dry clouds blown around by the winds. They are withered, uprooted trees without any fruit. As a result, they have died twice. 
JUD.1.13	 Their shame is like the foam on the wild waves of the sea. They are wandering stars for whom gloomy darkness is kept forever.
JUD.1.14	 Furthermore, Enoch, from the seventh generation after Adam, prophesied about them. He said, “The Lord has come with countless thousands of his holy angels. 
JUD.1.15	 He has come to judge all these people. He has come to convict all these ungodly sinners for all the ungodly things they have done and all the harsh things they have said about him.”
JUD.1.16	 These people complain, find fault, follow their own desires, say arrogant things, and flatter people in order to take advantage of them.
JUD.1.17	 Dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ told you to expect: 
JUD.1.18	 “In the last times people who ridicule ⌊God⌋ will appear. They will follow their own ungodly desires.” 
JUD.1.19	 These are the people who cause divisions. They are concerned about physical things, not spiritual things.
JUD.1.20	 Dear friends, use your most holy faith to grow. Pray with the Holy Spirit’s help. 
JUD.1.21	 Remain in God’s love as you look for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to give you eternal life.
JUD.1.22	 Show mercy to those who have doubts. 
JUD.1.23	 Save others by snatching them from the fire ⌊of hell⌋. Show mercy to others, even though you are afraid that you might be stained by their sinful lives.
JUD.1.24	 God can guard you so that you don’t fall and so that you can be full of joy as you stand in his glorious presence without fault. 
JUD.1.25	 Before time began, now, and for eternity glory, majesty, power, and authority belong to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
REV.1.1	 This is the revelation of Jesus Christ. God gave it to him to show his servants the things that must happen soon. He sent this revelation through his angel to his servant John. 
REV.1.2	 John testified about what he saw: God’s word and the testimony about Jesus Christ. 
REV.1.3	 Blessed is the one who reads, as well as those who hear the words of this prophecy and pay attention to what is written in it because the time is near.
REV.1.4	 From John to the seven churches in the province of Asia. Good will 
REV.1.5	 and from Jesus Christ, the witness, the trustworthy one, the first to come back to life, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. Glory and power forever and ever 
REV.1.6	 and has made us a kingdom, priests for God his Father. Amen.
REV.1.7	 Look! He is coming in the clouds.
REV.1.7	Every eye will see him,
REV.1.7	even those who pierced him.
REV.1.7	Every tribe on earth will mourn because of him.
REV.1.7	This is true. Amen.
REV.1.8	 “I am the A and the Z,” 
REV.1.9	 I am John, your brother. I share your suffering, ruling, and endurance because of Jesus. I was ⌊exiled⌋ on the island of Patmos because of God’s word and the testimony about Jesus. 
REV.1.10	 I came under the Spirit’s power on the Lord’s day. I heard a loud voice behind me like a trumpet, 
REV.1.11	 saying, “Write on a scroll what you see, and send it to the seven churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”
REV.1.12	 I turned toward the voice which was talking to me, and when I turned, I saw seven gold lamp stands. 
REV.1.13	 There was someone like the Son of Man among the lamp stands. He was wearing a robe that reached his feet. He wore a gold belt around his waist. 
REV.1.14	 His head and his hair were white like wool—like snow. His eyes were like flames of fire. 
REV.1.15	 His feet were like glowing bronze refined in a furnace. His voice was like the sound of raging waters. 
REV.1.16	 In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword. His face was like the sun when it shines in all its brightness.
REV.1.17	 When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. Then he laid his right hand on me and said, “Don’t be afraid! I am the first and the last, 
REV.1.18	 the living one. I was dead, but now I am alive forever. I have the keys of death and hell. 
REV.1.19	 Therefore, write down what you have seen, what is, and what is going to happen after these things. 
REV.1.20	 The hidden meaning of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lamp stands is this: The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lamp stands are the seven churches.
REV.2.1	 “To the messenger of the church in Ephesus, write:
REV.2.1	The one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, the one who walks among the seven gold lamp stands, says: 
REV.2.2	 I know what you have done—how hard you have worked and how you have endured. I also know that you cannot tolerate wicked people. You have tested those who call themselves apostles but are not apostles. You have discovered that they are liars. 
REV.2.3	 You have endured, suffered trouble because of my name, and have not grown weary. 
REV.2.4	 However, I have this against you: The love you had at first is gone. 
REV.2.5	 Remember how far you have fallen. Return to me and change the way you think and act, and do what you did at first. I will come to you and take your lamp stand from its place if you don’t change. 
REV.2.6	 But you have this in your favor—you hate what the Nicolaitans are doing. I also hate what they’re doing.
REV.2.7	 “Let the person who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the privilege of eating from the tree of life, which stands in the paradise of God, to everyone who wins the victory.
REV.2.8	 “To the messenger of the church in Smyrna, write:
REV.2.8	The first and the last, who was dead and became alive, says: 
REV.2.9	 I know how you are suffering, how poor you are—but you are rich. I also know that those who claim to be Jews slander you. They are the synagogue of Satan. 
REV.2.10	 Don’t be afraid of what you are going to suffer. The devil is going to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested. Your suffering will go on for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.
REV.2.11	 Let the person who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. Everyone who wins the victory will never be hurt by the second death.
REV.2.12	 “To the messenger of the church in Pergamum, write:
REV.2.12	The one who holds the sharp two-edged sword says: 
REV.2.13	 I know where you live. Satan’s throne is there. You hold on to my name and have not denied your belief in me, even in the days of Antipas. He was my faithful witness who was killed in your presence, where Satan lives. 
REV.2.14	 But I have a few things against you: You have among you those who follow what Balaam taught Balak. Balak trapped the people of Israel by ⌊encouraging⌋ them to eat food sacrificed to idols and to sin sexually. 
REV.2.15	 You also have some who follow what the Nicolaitans teach. 
REV.2.16	 So return to me and change the way you think and act, or I will come to you quickly and wage war against them with the sword from my mouth.
REV.2.17	 Let the person who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give some of the hidden manna to everyone who wins the victory. I will also give each person a white stone with a new name written on it, a name that is known only to the person who receives it.
REV.2.18	 “To the messenger of the church in Thyatira, write:
REV.2.18	The Son of God, whose eyes are like flames of fire and whose feet are like glowing bronze, says: 
REV.2.19	 I know what you do. I know your love, faith, service, and endurance. I also know that what you are doing now is greater than what you did at first. 
REV.2.20	 But I have something against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet. She teaches and misleads my servants to sin sexually and to eat food sacrificed to idols. 
REV.2.21	 I gave her time to turn to me and change the way she thinks and acts, but she refuses to turn away from her sexual sins. 
REV.2.22	 Watch me! I’m going to throw her into a sickbed. Those who commit sexual sins with her will also suffer a lot, unless they turn away from what she is doing. 
REV.2.23	 I will kill her children. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches hearts and minds. I will reward each of you for what you have done. 
REV.2.24	 But the rest of you in Thyatira—all who don’t hold on to Jezebel’s teaching, who haven’t learned what are called the deep things of Satan—I won’t burden you with anything else. 
REV.2.25	 Just hold on to what you have until I come.
REV.2.26	 I have received authority from my Father.
REV.2.27	 Those people will rule the nations with iron scepters and shatter them like pottery. 
REV.2.28	 I will also give them the morning star. 
REV.2.29	 Let the person who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
REV.3.1	 “To the messenger of the church in Sardis, write:
REV.3.1	The one who has God’s seven spirits and the seven stars says: I know what you have done. You are known for being alive, but you are dead. 
REV.3.2	 Be alert, and strengthen the things that are left which are about to die. I have found that what you are doing has not been completed in the sight of my God. 
REV.3.3	 So remember what you received and heard. Obey, and change the way you think and act. If you’re not alert, I’ll come like a thief. You don’t know when I will come. 
REV.3.4	 But you have a few people in Sardis who have kept their clothes clean. They will walk with me in white clothes because they deserve it.
REV.3.5	 Everyone who wins the victory this way will wear white clothes. I will never erase their names from the Book of Life. I will acknowledge them in the presence of my Father and his angels. 
REV.3.6	 Let the person who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
REV.3.7	 “To the messenger of the church in Philadelphia, write:
REV.3.7	The one who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens ⌊a door⌋ that no one can shut, and who shuts ⌊a door⌋ that no one can open, says: 
REV.3.8	 I know what you have done. See, I have opened a door in front of you that no one can shut. You only have a little strength, but you have paid attention to my word and have not denied my name. 
REV.3.9	 I will make those who are in Satan’s synagogue come and bow at your feet and realize that I have loved you. They claim that they are Jewish, but they are lying. 
REV.3.10	 Because you have obeyed my command to endure, I will keep you safe during the time of testing which is coming to the whole world to test those living on earth. 
REV.3.11	 I am coming soon! Hold on to what you have so that no one takes your crown.
REV.3.12	 I will make everyone who wins the victory a pillar in the temple of my God. They will never leave it again. I will write on them the name of my God, the name of the city of my God (the New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from my God), and my new name. 
REV.3.13	 Let the person who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
REV.3.14	 “To the messenger of the church in Laodicea, write:
REV.3.14	The amen, the witness who is faithful and true, the source of God’s creation, says: 
REV.3.15	 I know what you have done, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot. 
REV.3.16	 But since you are lukewarm and not hot or cold, I’m going to spit you out of my mouth. 
REV.3.17	 You say, ‘I’m rich. I’m wealthy. I don’t need anything.’ Yet, you do not realize that you are miserable, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked. 
REV.3.18	 I advise you: Buy gold purified in fire from me so that you may be rich. Buy white clothes from me. Wear them so that you may keep your shameful, naked body from showing. Buy ointment to put on your eyes so that you may see. 
REV.3.19	 I correct and discipline everyone I love. Take this seriously, and change the way you think and act. 
REV.3.20	 Look, I’m standing at the door and knocking. If anyone listens to my voice and opens the door, I’ll come in and we’ll eat together.
REV.3.21	 I will allow everyone who wins the victory to sit with me on my throne, as I have won the victory and have sat down with my Father on his throne. 
REV.3.22	 Let the person who has ears listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.”
REV.4.1	 After these things I saw a door standing open in heaven. I heard the first voice like a trumpet speaking to me. It said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after this.”
REV.4.2	 Instantly, I came under the Spirit’s power. I saw a throne in heaven, and someone was sitting on it. 
REV.4.3	 The one sitting there looked like gray quartz and red quartz. There was a rainbow around the throne which looked like an emerald.
REV.4.4	 Around that throne were 24 other thrones, and on these thrones sat 24 leaders wearing white clothes. They had gold crowns on their heads. 
REV.4.5	 Lightning, noise, and thunder came from the throne. Seven flaming torches were burning in front of the throne. These are the seven spirits of God.
REV.4.6	 In front of the throne, there was something like a sea of glass as clear as crystal. In the center near the throne and around the throne were four living creatures covered with eyes in front and in back. 
REV.4.7	 The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like a young bull, the third had a face like a human, and the fourth was like a flying eagle. 
REV.4.8	 Each of the four living creatures had six wings and were covered with eyes, inside and out. Without stopping day or night they were singing,
REV.4.8	“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,
REV.4.8	who was, who is, and who is coming.”
REV.4.9	 Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, to the one who lives forever and ever, 
REV.4.10	 the 24 leaders bow in front of the one who sits on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever. They place their crowns in front of the throne and say,
REV.4.11	 “Our Lord and God, you deserve to receive glory, honor, and power
REV.4.11	because you created everything.
REV.4.11	Everything came into existence and was created because of your will.”
REV.5.1	 I saw a scroll in the right hand of the one who sits on the throne. It had writing both on the inside and on the outside. It was sealed with seven seals. 
REV.5.2	 I saw a powerful angel calling out in a loud voice, “Who deserves to open the scroll and break the seals on it?” 
REV.5.3	 No one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth could open the scroll or look inside it. 
REV.5.4	 I cried bitterly because no one was found who deserved to open the scroll or look inside it.
REV.5.5	 Then one of the leaders said to me, “Stop crying! The Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has won the victory. He can open the scroll and the seven seals on it.”
REV.5.6	 I saw a lamb standing in the center near the throne with the four living creatures and the leaders. The lamb looked like he had been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent all over the world. 
REV.5.7	 He took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sits on the throne.
REV.5.8	 When the lamb had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the 24 leaders bowed in front of him. Each held a harp and a gold bowl full of incense, the prayers of God’s holy people. 
REV.5.9	 Then they sang a new song,
REV.5.9	“You deserve to take the scroll and open the seals on it,
REV.5.9	because you were slaughtered.
REV.5.9	You bought people with your blood to be God’s own.
REV.5.9	They are from every tribe, language, people, and nation.
REV.5.10	 You made them a kingdom and priests for our God.
REV.5.10	They will rule as kings on the earth.”
REV.5.11	 Then I heard the voices of many angels, the four living creatures, and the leaders surrounding the throne. They numbered ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands times thousands. 
REV.5.12	 In a loud voice they were singing,
REV.5.12	“The lamb who was slain deserves to receive
REV.5.12	power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise.”
REV.5.13	 I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea. Every creature in those places was singing,
REV.5.13	“To the one who sits on the throne and to the lamb
REV.5.13	be praise, honor, glory, and power forever and ever.”
REV.5.14	 The four living creatures said, “Amen!” Then the leaders bowed and worshiped.
REV.6.1	 I watched as the lamb opened the first of the seven seals. I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Go!” 
REV.6.2	 Then I looked, and there was a white horse, and its rider had a bow. He was given a crown and rode off as a warrior to win battles.
REV.6.3	 When the lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Go!” 
REV.6.4	 A second horse went out. It was fiery red. Its rider was given the power to take peace away from the earth and to make people slaughter one another. So he was given a large sword.
REV.6.5	 When the lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Go!” I looked, and there was a black horse, and its rider held a scale. 
REV.6.6	 I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a day’s pay or three quarts of barley for a day’s pay. But do not damage the olive oil and the wine.”
REV.6.7	 When the lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Go!” 
REV.6.8	 I looked, and there was a pale horse, and its rider’s name was Death. Hell followed him. They were given power over one-fourth of the earth to kill people using wars, famines, plagues, and the wild animals on the earth.
REV.6.9	 When the lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of God’s word and the testimony they had given about him. 
REV.6.10	 They cried out in a loud voice, “Holy and true Master, how long before you judge and take revenge on those living on earth who shed our blood?” 
REV.6.11	 Each of the souls was given a white robe. They were told to rest a little longer until all their coworkers, the other Christians, would be killed as they had been killed.
REV.6.12	 I watched as the lamb opened the sixth seal. A powerful earthquake struck. The sun turned as black as sackcloth made of hair. The full moon turned as red as blood. 
REV.6.13	 The stars fell from the sky to the earth like figs dropping from a fig tree when it is shaken by a strong wind. 
REV.6.14	 The sky vanished like a scroll being rolled up. Every mountain and island was moved from its place. 
REV.6.15	 Then the kings of the earth, the important people, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and all the slaves and free people hid themselves in caves and among the rocks in the mountains. 
REV.6.16	 They said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the lamb, 
REV.6.17	 because the frightening day of their anger has come, and who is able to endure it?”
REV.7.1	 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They were holding back the four winds of the earth to keep them from blowing on the land, the sea, or any tree. 
REV.7.2	 I saw another angel coming from the east with the seal of the living God. He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been allowed to harm the land and sea, 
REV.7.3	 “Don’t harm the land, the sea, or the trees until we have put the seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.”
REV.7.4	 I heard how many were sealed: 144,000. Those who were sealed were from every tribe of the people of Israel:
REV.7.5	 12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed,
REV.7.5	12,000 from the tribe of Reuben,
REV.7.5	12,000 from the tribe of Gad,
REV.7.6	 12,000 from the tribe of Asher,
REV.7.6	12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali,
REV.7.6	12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,
REV.7.7	 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon,
REV.7.7	12,000 from the tribe of Levi,
REV.7.7	12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,
REV.7.8	 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun,
REV.7.8	12,000 from the tribe of Joseph,
REV.7.8	12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed.
REV.7.9	 After these things I saw a large crowd from every nation, tribe, people, and language. No one was able to count how many people there were. They were standing in front of the throne and the lamb. They were wearing white robes, holding palm branches in their hands, 
REV.7.10	 and crying out in a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the lamb!”
REV.7.11	 All the angels stood around the throne with the leaders and the four living creatures. They bowed in front of the throne with their faces touching the ground, worshiped God, 
REV.7.12	 and said,
REV.7.12	“Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength
REV.7.12	be to our God forever and ever! Amen!”
REV.7.13	 One of the leaders asked me, “Who are these people wearing white robes, and where did they come from?”
REV.7.14	 I answered him, “Sir, you know.”
REV.7.14	Then he told me,
REV.7.14	“These are the people who are coming out of the terrible suffering.
REV.7.14	They have washed their robes
REV.7.14	and made them white in the blood of the lamb.
REV.7.15	 That is why they are in front of the throne of God.
REV.7.15	They serve him day and night in his temple.
REV.7.15	The one who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.
REV.7.16	 They will never be hungry or thirsty again.
REV.7.16	Neither the sun nor any burning heat will ever overcome them.
REV.7.17	 The lamb in the center near the throne will be their shepherd.
REV.7.17	He will lead them to springs filled with the water of life,
REV.7.17	and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.”
REV.8.1	 When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
REV.8.2	 Then I saw the seven angels who stand in God’s presence, and they were given seven trumpets. 
REV.8.3	 Another angel came with a gold incense burner and stood at the altar. He was given a lot of incense to offer on the gold altar in front of the throne. He offered it with the prayers of all of God’s people. 
REV.8.4	 The smoke from the incense went up from the angel’s hand to God along with the prayers of God’s people. 
REV.8.5	 The angel took the incense burner, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the earth. Then there was thunder, noise, lightning, and an earthquake.
REV.8.6	 The seven angels who had the seven trumpets got ready to blow them.
REV.8.7	 When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire were mixed with blood, and were thrown on the earth. One-third of the earth was burned up, one-third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
REV.8.8	 When the second angel blew his trumpet, something like a huge mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. One-third of the sea turned into blood, 
REV.8.9	 one-third of the creatures that were living in the sea died, and one-third of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.10	 When the third angel blew his trumpet, a huge star flaming like a torch fell from the sky. It fell on one-third of the rivers and on the springs. 
REV.8.11	 That star was named Wormwood. One-third of the water turned into wormwood, and many people died from this water because it had turned bitter.
REV.8.12	 When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, one-third of the sun, one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars were struck so that one-third of them turned dark. There was no light for one-third of the day and one-third of the night.
REV.8.13	 I saw an eagle flying overhead, and I heard it say in a loud voice, “Catastrophe, catastrophe, catastrophe for those living on earth, because of the remaining trumpet blasts which the three angels are about to blow.”
REV.9.1	 When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky. The star was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit. 
REV.9.2	 It opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke came out of the shaft like the smoke from a large furnace. The smoke darkened the sun and the air. 
REV.9.3	 Locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth, and they were given power like the power of earthly scorpions. 
REV.9.4	 They were told not to harm any grass, green plant, or tree on the earth. They could harm only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 
REV.9.5	 They were not allowed to kill them. They were only allowed to torture them for five months. Their torture was like the pain of a scorpion’s sting. 
REV.9.6	 At that time people will look for death and never find it. They will long to die, but death will escape them.
REV.9.7	 The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. They seemed to have crowns that looked like gold on their heads. Their faces were like human faces. 
REV.9.8	 They had hair like women’s hair and teeth like lions’ teeth. 
REV.9.9	 They had breastplates like iron. The noise from their wings was like the roar of chariots with many horses rushing into battle. 
REV.9.10	 They had tails and stingers like scorpions. They had the power to hurt people with their tails for five months. 
REV.9.11	 The king who ruled them was the angel from the bottomless pit. In Hebrew he is called Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.
REV.9.12	 The first catastrophe is over. After these things there are two more catastrophes yet to come.
REV.9.13	 When the sixth angel blew his trumpet, I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar in front of God. 
REV.9.14	 The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are held at the great Euphrates River.” 
REV.9.15	 The four angels who were ready for that hour, day, month, and year were released to kill one-third of humanity. 
REV.9.16	 The soldiers on horses numbered 20,000 times 10,000. I heard how many there were.
REV.9.17	 In the vision that I had, the horses and their riders looked like this: The riders had breastplates that were fiery red, pale blue, and yellow. The horses had heads like lions. Fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths. 
REV.9.18	 These three plagues—the fire, smoke, and sulfur which came out of their mouths—killed one-third of humanity. 
REV.9.19	 The power of these horses is in their mouths and their tails. (Their tails have heads like snakes which they use to hurt people.)
REV.9.20	 The people who survived these plagues still did not turn to me and change the way they were thinking and acting. If they had, they would have stopped worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see, hear, or walk. 
REV.9.21	 They did not turn away from committing murder, practicing witchcraft, sinning sexually, or stealing.
REV.10.1	 I saw another powerful angel come down from heaven. He was dressed in a cloud, and there was a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet were like columns of fire. 
REV.10.2	 He held a small, opened scroll in his hand. He set his right foot on the sea and his left on the land. 
REV.10.3	 Then he shouted in a loud voice as a lion roars. When he shouted, the seven thunders spoke with voices of their own. 
REV.10.4	 When the seven thunders spoke, I was going to write it down. I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and don’t write it down.”
REV.10.5	 The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven. 
REV.10.6	 He swore an oath by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. He said, “There will be no more delay. 
REV.10.7	 In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet, the mystery of God will be completed, as he had made this Good News known to his servants, the prophets.” 
REV.10.8	 The voice which I had heard from heaven spoke to me again. It said, “Take the opened scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.” 
REV.10.9	 I went to the angel and asked him to give me the small scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will be bitter in your stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”
REV.10.10	 I took the small scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, it was bitter in my stomach. 
REV.10.11	 The seven thunders told me, “Again you must speak what God has revealed in front of many people, nations, languages, and kings.”
REV.11.1	 Then I was given a stick like a measuring stick. I was told, “Stand up and measure the temple of God and the altar. Count those who worship there. 
REV.11.2	 But do not measure the temple courtyard. Leave that out, because it is given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for 42 months. 
REV.11.3	 I will allow my two witnesses who wear sackcloth to speak what God has revealed. They will speak for 1,260 days.”
REV.11.4	 These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands standing in the presence of the Lord of the earth. 
REV.11.5	 If anyone wants to hurt them, fire comes out of the witnesses’ mouths and burns up their enemies. If anyone wants to hurt them, he must be killed the same way. 
REV.11.6	 These witnesses have authority to shut the sky in order to keep rain from falling during the time they speak what God has revealed. They have authority to turn water into blood and to strike the earth with any plague as often as they want.
REV.11.7	 When the witnesses finish their testimony, the beast which comes from the bottomless pit will fight them, conquer them, and kill them. 
REV.11.8	 Their dead bodies will lie on the street of the important city where their Lord was crucified. The spiritual names of that city are Sodom and Egypt. 
REV.11.9	 For 3½ days some members of the people, tribes, languages, and nations will look at the witnesses’ dead bodies and will not allow anyone to bury them. 
REV.11.10	 Those living on earth will gloat over the witnesses’ death. They will celebrate and send gifts to each other because these two prophets had tormented those living on earth.
REV.11.11	 After 3½ days the breath of life from God entered the two witnesses, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who watched them. 
REV.11.12	 The witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven calling to them, “Come up here.” They went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them. 
REV.11.13	 At that moment a powerful earthquake struck. One-tenth of the city collapsed, 7,000 people were killed by the earthquake, and the rest were terrified. They gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	 The second catastrophe is over. The third catastrophe will soon be here.
REV.11.15	 When the seventh angel blew his trumpet, there were loud voices in heaven, saying,
REV.11.15	“The kingdom of the world has become
REV.11.15	the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah,
REV.11.15	and he will rule as king forever and ever.”
REV.11.16	 Then the 24 leaders, who were sitting on their thrones in God’s presence, immediately bowed, worshiped God, 
REV.11.17	 and said,
REV.11.17	“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,
REV.11.17	who is and who was,
REV.11.17	because you have taken your great power
REV.11.17	and have begun ruling as king.
REV.11.18	 “The nations were angry, but your anger has come.
REV.11.18	The time has come for the dead to be judged:
REV.11.18	to reward your servants, the prophets,
REV.11.18	your holy people,
REV.11.18	and those who fear your name,
REV.11.18	no matter if they are important or unimportant,
REV.11.18	and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”
REV.11.19	 God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his promise was seen inside his temple. There was lightning, noise, thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.
REV.12.1	 A spectacular sign appeared in the sky: There was a woman who was dressed in the sun, who had the moon under her feet and a crown of 12 stars on her head. 
REV.12.2	 She was pregnant. She cried out from labor pains and the agony of giving birth.
REV.12.3	 Another sign appeared in the sky: a huge fiery red serpent with seven heads, ten horns, and seven crowns on its heads. 
REV.12.4	 Its tail swept away one-third of the stars in the sky and threw them down to earth. The serpent stood in front of the woman who was going to give birth so that it could devour her child when it was born. 
REV.12.5	 She gave birth to a son, a boy, who is to rule all the nations with an iron scepter. Her child was snatched away and taken to God and to his throne. 
REV.12.6	 Then the woman fled into the wilderness where God had prepared a place for her so that she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.
REV.12.7	 Then a war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels had to fight a war with the serpent. The serpent and its angels fought. 
REV.12.8	 But it was not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. 
REV.12.9	 The huge serpent was thrown down. That ancient snake, named Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world, was thrown down to earth. Its angels were thrown down with it.
REV.12.10	 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying,
REV.12.10	“Now the salvation, power, kingdom of our God,
REV.12.10	and the authority of his Messiah have come.
REV.12.10	The one accusing our brothers and sisters,
REV.12.10	the one accusing them day and night in the presence of our God,
REV.12.10	has been thrown out.
REV.12.11	 They won the victory over him because of the blood of the lamb
REV.12.11	and the word of their testimony.
REV.12.11	They didn’t love their life so much that they refused to give it up.
REV.12.12	 Be glad for this reason, heavens and those who live in them.
REV.12.12	How horrible it is for the earth and the sea
REV.12.12	because the Devil has come down to them with fierce anger,
REV.12.12	knowing that he has little time left.”
REV.12.13	 When the serpent saw that it had been thrown down to earth, it persecuted the woman who had given birth to the boy. 
REV.12.14	 The woman was given the two wings of the large eagle in order to fly away from the snake to her place in the wilderness, where she could be taken care of for a time, times, and half a time. 
REV.12.15	 The snake’s mouth poured out a river of water behind the woman in order to sweep her away. 
REV.12.16	 The earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river which had poured out of the serpent’s mouth. 
REV.12.17	 The serpent became angry with the woman. So it went away to fight with her other children, the ones who keep God’s commands and hold on to the testimony of Jesus.
REV.12.18	 The serpent stood on the sandy shore of the sea.
REV.13.1	 I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns, seven heads, and ten crowns on its horns. There were insulting names on its heads. 
REV.13.2	 The beast that I saw was like a leopard. Its feet were like bear’s feet. Its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. The serpent gave its power, kingdom, and far-reaching authority to the beast. 
REV.13.3	 One of the beast’s heads looked like it had a fatal wound, but its fatal wound was healed.
REV.13.3	All the people of the world were amazed and followed the beast. 
REV.13.4	 They worshiped the serpent because it had given authority to the beast. They also worshiped the beast and said, “Who is like the beast? Who can fight a war with it?” 
REV.13.5	 The beast was allowed to speak arrogant and insulting things. It was given authority to act for 42 months. 
REV.13.6	 It opened its mouth to insult God, to insult his name and his tent—those who are living in heaven. 
REV.13.7	 It was allowed to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. It was also given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation. 
REV.13.8	 Everyone living on earth will worship it, everyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life. That book belongs to the lamb who was slaughtered before the creation of the world.
REV.13.9	 If anyone has ears, let him listen:
REV.13.10	 If anyone is taken prisoner, he must go to prison.
REV.13.10	If anyone is killed with a sword, with a sword he must be killed.
REV.13.10	In this situation God’s holy people need endurance and confidence.
REV.13.11	 I saw another beast come from the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb. It talked like a serpent. 
REV.13.12	 The second beast uses all the authority of the first beast in its presence. The second beast makes the earth and those living on it worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. 
REV.13.13	 The second beast performs spectacular signs. It even makes fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people. 
REV.13.14	 It deceives those living on earth with the signs that it is allowed to do in front of the ⌊first⌋ beast. It tells those living on earth to make a statue for the beast who was wounded by a sword and yet lived.
REV.13.15	 The second beast was allowed to put breath into the statue of the ⌊first⌋ beast. Then the statue of the ⌊first⌋ beast could talk and put to death whoever would not worship it. 
REV.13.16	 The second beast forces all people—important and unimportant people, rich and poor people, free people and slaves—to be branded on their right hands or on their foreheads. 
REV.13.17	 It does this so that no one may buy or sell unless he has the brand, which is the beast’s name or the number of its name.
REV.13.18	 In this situation wisdom is needed. Let the person who has insight figure out the number of the beast, because it is a human number.
REV.14.1	 I looked, and the lamb was standing on Mount Zion. There were 144,000 people with him who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. 
REV.14.2	 Then I heard a sound from heaven like the noise of raging water and the noise of loud thunder. The sound I heard was like the music played by harpists. 
REV.14.3	 They were singing a new song in front of the throne, the four living creatures, and the leaders. Only the 144,000 people who had been bought on earth could learn the song.
REV.14.4	 These 144,000 virgins are pure. They follow the lamb wherever he goes. They were bought from among humanity as the first ones offered to God and to the lamb. 
REV.14.5	 They’ve never told a lie. They are blameless.
REV.14.6	 I saw another angel flying overhead with the everlasting Good News to spread to those who live on earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people. 
REV.14.7	 The angel said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the time has come for him to judge. Worship the one who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs.”
REV.14.8	 Another angel, a second one, followed him, and said, “Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen! She has made all the nations drink the wine of her passionate sexual sins.”
REV.14.9	 Another angel, a third one, followed them, and said in a loud voice, “Whoever worships the beast or its statue, whoever is branded on his forehead or his hand, 
REV.14.10	 will drink the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured unmixed into the cup of God’s anger. Then he will be tortured by fiery sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the lamb. 
REV.14.11	 The smoke from their torture will go up forever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast or its statue, or for anyone branded with its name.” 
REV.14.12	 In this situation God’s holy people, who obey his commands and keep their faith in Jesus, need endurance.
REV.14.13	 I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: From now on those who die believing in the Lord are blessed.”
REV.14.13	“Yes,” says the Spirit. “Let them rest from their hard work. What they have done goes with them.”
REV.14.14	 Then I looked, and there was a white cloud, and on the cloud sat someone who was like the Son of Man. He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 
REV.14.15	 Another angel came out of the temple. He cried out in a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud, “Swing your sickle, and gather the harvest. The time has come to gather it, because the harvest on the earth is overripe.”
REV.14.16	 The one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the harvesting of the earth was completed.
REV.14.17	 Another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He, too, had a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	 Yet another angel came from the altar with authority over fire. This angel called out in a loud voice to the angel with the sharp sickle, “Swing your sickle, and gather the bunches of grapes from the vine of the earth, because those grapes are ripe.” 
REV.14.19	 The angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the grapes from the vine of the earth. He threw them into the winepress of God’s anger. 
REV.14.20	 The grapes were trampled in the winepress outside the city. Blood flowed out of the winepress as high as a horse’s bridle for 1,600 stadia.
REV.15.1	 I saw another sign in heaven. It was spectacular and amazing. There were seven angels with the last seven plagues which are the final expression of God’s anger.
REV.15.2	 Then I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. Those who had won the victory over the beast, its statue, and the number of its name were standing on the glassy sea. They were holding God’s harps 
REV.15.3	 and singing the song of God’s servant Moses and the song of the lamb. They sang,
REV.15.3	“The things you do are spectacular and amazing, Lord God Almighty.
REV.15.3	The way you do them is fair and true, King of the Nations.
REV.15.4	 Lord, who won’t fear and praise your name?
REV.15.4	You are the only holy one,
REV.15.4	and all the nations will come to worship you
REV.15.4	because they know about your fair judgments.”
REV.15.5	 After these things I looked, and I saw that the temple of the tent containing the words of God’s promise was open in heaven. 
REV.15.6	 The seven angels with the seven plagues came out of the temple wearing clean, shining linen with gold belts around their waists. 
REV.15.7	 One of the four living creatures gave seven gold bowls full of the anger of God, who lives forever and ever, to the seven angels. 
REV.15.8	 The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and his power. No one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels came to an end.
REV.16.1	 I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Pour the seven bowls of God’s anger over the earth.”
REV.16.2	 The first angel poured his bowl over the earth. Horrible, painful sores appeared on the people who had the brand of the beast and worshiped its statue.
REV.16.3	 The second angel poured his bowl over the sea. The sea turned into blood like the blood of a dead man, and every living thing in the sea died.
REV.16.4	 The third angel poured his bowl over the rivers and the springs. They turned into blood. 
REV.16.5	 Then I heard the angel of the water say,
REV.16.5	“You are fair.
REV.16.5	You are the one who is and the one who was, the holy one,
REV.16.5	because you have judged these things.
REV.16.6	 You have given them blood to drink
REV.16.6	because they have poured out
REV.16.6	the blood of God’s people and prophets.
REV.16.6	This is what they deserve.”
REV.16.7	 Then I heard the altar answer,
REV.16.7	“Yes, Lord God Almighty, your judgments are true and fair.”
REV.16.8	 The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun. The sun was allowed to burn people with fire. 
REV.16.9	 They were severely burned. They cursed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues. They would not change the way they think and act and give him glory.
REV.16.10	 The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast. Its kingdom turned dark. People gnawed on their tongues in anguish 
REV.16.11	 and cursed the God of heaven for their pains and their sores. However, they would not stop what they were doing.
REV.16.12	 The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great Euphrates River. The water in the river dried up to make a road for the kings from the east. 
REV.16.13	 Then I saw three evil spirits like frogs come out of the mouths of the serpent, the beast, and the false prophet. 
REV.16.14	 They are spirits of demons that do miracles. These spirits go to the kings of the whole world and gather them for the war on the frightening day of God Almighty.
REV.16.15	 “See, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who remains alert and doesn’t lose his clothes. He will not have to go naked and let others see his shame.”
REV.16.16	 The spirits gathered the kings at the place which is called Armageddon in Hebrew.
REV.16.17	 The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air. A loud voice came from the throne in the temple, and said, “It has happened!” 
REV.16.18	 There was lightning, noise, thunder, and a powerful earthquake. There has never been such a powerful earthquake since humans have been on earth. 
REV.16.19	 The important city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. God remembered to give Babylon the Great the cup of wine from his fierce anger. 
REV.16.20	 Every island vanished, and the mountains could no longer be seen. 
REV.16.21	 Large, heavy hailstones fell from the sky on people. The people cursed God because the plague of hail was such a terrible plague.
REV.17.1	 One of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of that notorious prostitute who sits on raging waters. 
REV.17.2	 The kings of the earth had sex with her, and those living on earth became drunk on the wine of her sexual sins.” 
REV.17.3	 Then the angel carried me by his power into the wilderness.
REV.17.3	I saw a woman sitting on a bright red beast covered with insulting names. It had seven heads and ten horns. 
REV.17.4	 The woman wore purple clothes, bright red clothes, gold jewelry, gems, and pearls. In her hand she was holding a gold cup filled with detestable and evil things from her sexual sins. 
REV.17.5	 A name was written on her forehead. The name was Mystery: Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Detestable Things of the Earth. 
REV.17.6	 I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people and of those who testify about Jesus. I was very surprised when I saw her.
REV.17.7	 The angel asked me, “Why are you surprised? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and the beast with the seven heads and the ten horns that carries her.
REV.17.8	 “You saw the beast which once was, is no longer, and will come from the bottomless pit and go to its destruction. Those living on earth, whose names were not written in the Book of Life when the world was created, will be surprised when they see the beast because it was, is no longer, and will come again.
REV.17.9	 “In this situation a wise mind is needed. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is sitting. 
REV.17.10	 They are also seven kings. Five of them have fallen, one is ruling now, and the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must remain for a little while. 
REV.17.11	 The beast that was and is no longer is the eighth king. It belongs with the seven kings and goes to its destruction.
REV.17.12	 “The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet started to rule. They will receive authority to rule as kings with the beast for one hour. 
REV.17.13	 They have one purpose—to give their power and authority to the beast. 
REV.17.14	 They will go to war against the lamb. The lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those who are called, chosen, and faithful are with him.”
REV.17.15	 The angel also said to me, “The waters you saw, on which the prostitute is sitting, are people, crowds, nations, and languages. 
REV.17.16	 The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the prostitute. They will leave her abandoned and naked. They will eat her flesh and burn her up in a fire. 
REV.17.17	 God has made them do what he wants them to do. So they will give their kingdom to the beast until God’s words are carried out. 
REV.17.18	 The woman you saw is the important city which dominates the kings of the earth.”
REV.18.1	 After these things I saw another angel come from heaven. He had tremendous power, and his glory lit up the earth. 
REV.18.2	 He cried out in a powerful voice, “Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen! She has become a home for demons. She is a prison for every evil spirit, every unclean 
REV.18.3	 All the nations fell because of the wine of her sexual sins. The kings of the earth had sex with her. Her luxurious wealth has made the merchants of the earth rich.”
REV.18.4	 I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of Babylon, my people, so that you do not participate in her sins and suffer from any of her plagues. 
REV.18.5	 Her sins are piled as high as heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. 
REV.18.6	 Do to her what she has done. Give her twice as much as she gave. Serve her a drink in her own cup twice as large as the drink she served others. 
REV.18.7	 She gave herself glory and luxury. Now give her just as much torture and misery. She says to herself, ‘I’m a queen on a throne, not a widow. I’ll never be miserable.’ 
REV.18.8	 For this reason her plagues of death, misery, and starvation will come in a single day. She will be burned up in a fire, because the Lord God, who judges her, is powerful.
REV.18.9	 “The kings of the earth who had sex with her and lived in luxury with her will cry and mourn over her when they see the smoke rise from her raging fire. 
REV.18.10	 Frightened by her torture, they will stand far away and say,
REV.18.10	‘How horrible, how horrible it is for that important city,
REV.18.10	the powerful city Babylon!
REV.18.10	In one moment judgment has come to it!’
REV.18.11	 “The merchants of the earth cry and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo anymore. 
REV.18.12	 No one buys their cargo of gold, silver, gems, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, bright red cloth, all kinds of citron wood, articles made of ivory and very costly wood, bronze, iron, marble, 
REV.18.13	 cinnamon, spices, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive oil, flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, wagons, slaves (that is, humans).
REV.18.14	 ‘The fruit you craved is gone.
REV.18.14	All your luxuries and your splendor have disappeared.
REV.18.14	No one will ever find them again.’
REV.18.15	 “Frightened by her torture, the merchants who had become rich by selling these things will stand far away. They will cry and mourn, 
REV.18.16	 saying,
REV.18.16	‘How horrible, how horrible for that important city
REV.18.16	which was wearing fine linen, purple clothes,
REV.18.16	bright red clothes, gold jewelry, gems, and pearls.
REV.18.17	 In one moment all this wealth has been destroyed!’
REV.18.17	Every ship’s captain, everyone who traveled by ship, sailors, and everyone who made their living from the sea stood far away. 
REV.18.18	 When they saw the smoke rise from her raging fire, they repeatedly cried out, ‘Was there ever a city as important as this?’ 
REV.18.19	 Then they threw dust on their heads and shouted while crying and mourning,
REV.18.19	‘How horrible, how horrible for that important city.
REV.18.19	Everyone who had a ship at sea
REV.18.19	grew rich because of that city’s high prices.
REV.18.19	In one moment it has been destroyed!’
REV.18.20	 “Gloat over it, heaven, God’s people, apostles, and prophets.
REV.18.20	God has condemned it for you.”
REV.18.21	 Then a powerful angel picked up a stone that was like a large millstone. He threw it into the sea and said,
REV.18.21	“The important city Babylon will be thrown down with the same force.
REV.18.21	It will never be found again.
REV.18.22	 The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters
REV.18.22	will never be heard in it again.
REV.18.22	A skilled craftsman—regardless of the type of craft—
REV.18.22	will never be found in it again.
REV.18.22	The sound of a millstone
REV.18.22	will never be heard in it again.
REV.18.23	 Light from lamps
REV.18.23	will never shine in it again.
REV.18.23	Voices of brides and grooms
REV.18.23	will never be heard in it again.
REV.18.23	Its merchants were the important people of the world,
REV.18.23	because all the nations were deceived by its witchcraft.
REV.18.24	 “The blood of prophets, God’s people, and everyone who had been murdered on earth was found in it.”
REV.19.1	 After these things I heard what sounded like the loud noise from a large crowd in heaven, saying,
REV.19.1	“Hallelujah!
REV.19.1	Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God.
REV.19.2	 His judgments are true and fair.
REV.19.2	He has condemned the notorious prostitute
REV.19.2	who corrupted the world with her sexual sins.
REV.19.2	He has taken revenge on her for the blood of his servants.”
REV.19.3	 A second time they said, “Hallelujah! The smoke goes up from her forever and ever.” 
REV.19.4	 The 24 leaders and the 4 living creatures bowed and worshiped God, who was sitting on the throne. They said, “Amen! Hallelujah!” 
REV.19.5	 A voice came from the throne. It said, “Praise our God, all who serve and fear him, no matter who you are.”
REV.19.6	 I heard what sounded like the noise from a large crowd, like the noise of raging waters, like the noise of loud thunder, saying,
REV.19.6	“Hallelujah! The Lord our God, the Almighty, has become king.
REV.19.7	 Let us rejoice, be happy, and give him glory
REV.19.7	because it’s time for the marriage of the lamb.
REV.19.7	His bride has made herself ready.
REV.19.8	 She has been given the privilege of wearing
REV.19.8	dazzling, pure linen.”
REV.19.8	This fine linen represents the things that God’s holy people do that have his approval.
REV.19.9	 Then the angel said to me, “Write this: ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the lamb’s wedding banquet.’” He also told me, “These are the true words of God.” 
REV.19.10	 I bowed at his feet to worship him. But he told me, “Don’t do that! I am your coworker and a coworker of the Christians who hold on to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, because the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy!”
REV.19.11	 I saw heaven standing open. There was a white horse, and its rider is named Faithful and True. With integrity he judges and wages war. 
REV.19.12	 His eyes are flames of fire. On his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him, but only he knows what it is. 
REV.19.13	 He wears clothes dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
REV.19.14	 The armies of heaven, wearing pure, white linen, follow him on white horses. 
REV.19.15	 A sharp sword comes out of his mouth to defeat the nations. He will rule them with an iron scepter and tread the winepress of the fierce anger of God Almighty. 
REV.19.16	 On his clothes and his thigh he has a name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
REV.19.17	 I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead, “Come! Gather for the great banquet of God. 
REV.19.18	 Eat the flesh of kings, generals, warriors, horses and their riders, and all free people and slaves, both important or insignificant people.”
REV.19.19	 I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army. 
REV.19.20	 The beast and the false prophet who had done miracles for the beast were captured. By these miracles the false prophet had deceived those who had the brand of the beast and worshiped its statue. Both of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. 
REV.19.21	 The rider on the horse killed the rest with the sword that came out of his mouth. All the birds gorged themselves on the flesh of those who had been killed.
REV.20.1	 I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key to the bottomless pit and a large chain in his hand. 
REV.20.2	 He overpowered the serpent, that ancient snake, named Devil and Satan. The angel chained up the serpent for 1,000 years. 
REV.20.3	 He threw it into the bottomless pit. The angel shut and sealed the pit over the serpent to keep it from deceiving the nations anymore until the 1,000 years were over. After that it must be set free for a little while.
REV.20.4	 I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were allowed to judge. Then I saw the souls of those whose heads had been cut off because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its statue and were not branded on their foreheads or hands. They lived and ruled with Christ for 1,000 years. 
REV.20.5	 The rest of the dead did not live until the 1,000 years ended.
REV.20.5	This is the first time that people come back to life. 
REV.20.6	 Blessed and holy are those who are included the first time that people come back to life. The second death has no power over them. They will continue to be priests of God and Christ. They will rule with him for 1,000 years.
REV.20.7	 When 1,000 years are over, Satan will be freed from his prison. 
REV.20.8	 He will go out to deceive Gog and Magog, the nations in the four corners of the earth, and gather them for war. They will be as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore. 
REV.20.9	 ⌊I saw that⌋ they spread over the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s holy people and the beloved city. Fire came from heaven and burned them up. 
REV.20.10	 The devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the fiery lake of sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were also thrown. They will be tortured day and night forever and ever.
REV.20.11	 I saw a large, white throne and the one who was sitting on it. The earth and the sky fled from his presence, but no place was found for them. 
REV.20.12	 I saw the dead, both important and unimportant people, standing in front of the throne. Books were opened, including the Book of Life. The dead were judged on the basis of what they had done, as recorded in the books. 
REV.20.13	 The sea gave up its dead. Death and hell gave up their dead. People were judged based on what they had done. 
REV.20.14	 Death and hell were thrown into the fiery lake. (The fiery lake is the second death.) 
REV.20.15	 Those whose names were not found in the Book of Life were thrown into the fiery lake.
REV.21.1	 I saw a new heaven and a new earth, because the first heaven and earth had disappeared, and the sea was gone. 
REV.21.2	 Then I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, dressed like a bride ready for her husband. 
REV.21.3	 I heard a loud voice from the throne say, “God lives with humans! God will make his home with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them and be their God. 
REV.21.4	 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There won’t be any more death. There won’t be any grief, crying, or pain, because the first things have disappeared.”
REV.21.5	 The one sitting on the throne said, “I am making everything new.” He said, “Write this: ‘These words are faithful and true.’” 
REV.21.6	 He said to me, “It has happened! I am the A and the Z,
REV.21.7	 Everyone who wins the victory will inherit these things. I will be their God, and they will be my children. 
REV.21.8	 But cowardly, unfaithful, and detestable people, murderers, sexual sinners, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars will find themselves in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”
REV.21.9	 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the last seven plagues came to me and said, “Come! I will show you the bride, the wife of the lamb.” 
REV.21.10	 He carried me by his power away to a large, high mountain. He showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven. 
REV.21.11	 It had the glory of God. Its light was like a valuable gem, like gray quartz, as clear as crystal. 
REV.21.12	 It had a large, high wall with 12 gates. Twelve angels were at the gates. The names of the 12 tribes of Israel were written on the gates. 
REV.21.13	 There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. 
REV.21.14	 The wall of the city had 12 foundations. The 12 names of the 12 apostles of the lamb were written on them.
REV.21.15	 The angel who was talking to me had a gold measuring stick to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 
REV.21.16	 The city was square. It was as wide as it was long. He measured the city with the stick. It was 12,000 stadia 
REV.21.17	 He measured its wall. According to human measurement, which the angel was using, it was 144 cubits.
REV.21.18	 Its wall was made of gray quartz. The city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass. 
REV.21.19	 The foundations of the city wall were beautifully decorated with all kinds of gems: The first foundation was gray quartz, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, 
REV.21.20	 the fifth onyx, the sixth red quartz, the seventh yellow quartz, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth green quartz, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. 
REV.21.21	 The 12 gates were 12 pearls. Each gate was made of one pearl. The street of the city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass.
REV.21.22	 I did not see any temple in it, because the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are its temple. 
REV.21.23	 The city doesn’t need any sun or moon to give it light because the glory of God gave it light. The lamb was its lamp. 
REV.21.24	 The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. 
REV.21.25	 Its gates will be open all day. They will never close because there won’t be any night there. 
REV.21.26	 They will bring the glory and wealth of the nations into the holy city. 
REV.21.27	 Nothing unclean,
REV.22.1	 The angel showed me a river filled with the water of life, as clear as crystal. It was flowing from the throne of God and the lamb. 
REV.22.2	 Between the street of the city and the river there was a tree of life visible from both sides. It produced 12 kinds of fruit. Each month had its own fruit. The leaves of the tree will heal the nations. 
REV.22.3	 There will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and the lamb will be in the city. His servants will worship him 
REV.22.4	 and see his face. His name will be on their foreheads. 
REV.22.5	 There will be no more night, and they will not need any light from lamps or the sun because the Lord God will shine on them. They will rule as kings forever and ever.
REV.22.6	 He said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants the things that must happen soon. 
REV.22.7	 I’m coming soon! Blessed is the one who follows the words of the prophecy in this book.”
REV.22.8	 I, John, heard and saw these things. When I had heard and seen them, I bowed to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things. 
REV.22.9	 He told me, “Don’t do that! I am your coworker. I work with other Christians, the prophets, and those who follow the words in this book. Worship God!”
REV.22.10	 Then the angel said to me, “Don’t seal up the words of the prophecy in this book because the time is near. 
REV.22.11	 Let those who don’t have God’s approval go without it, and let filthy people continue to be filthy. Let those who have God’s approval continue to have it, and let holy people continue to be holy.”
REV.22.12	 “I’m coming soon! I will bring my reward with me to pay all people based on what they have done. 
REV.22.13	 I am the A and the Z,
REV.22.14	 “Blessed are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. 
REV.22.15	 Outside are dogs, sorcerers, sexual sinners, murderers, idolaters, and all who lie in what they say and what they do.
REV.22.16	 “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give this testimony to you for the churches. I am the root and descendant of David. I am the bright morning star.”
REV.22.17	 The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” Let those who hear this say, “Come!” Let those who are thirsty come! Let those who want the water of life take it as a gift.
REV.22.18	 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy in this book: If anyone adds anything to this, God will strike him with the plagues that are written in this book. 
REV.22.19	 If anyone takes away any words from this book of prophecy, God will take away his portion of the tree of life and the holy city that are described in this book.
REV.22.20	 The one who is testifying to these things says, “Yes, I’m coming soon!”
REV.22.20	Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!
REV.22.21	 The good will
