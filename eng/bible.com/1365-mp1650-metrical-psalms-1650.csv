PSA.1.1	That man hath perfect blessedness,
PSA.1.1	who walketh not astray
PSA.1.1	In counsel of ungodly men,
PSA.1.1	nor stands in sinners' way,
PSA.1.1	Nor sitteth in the scorner's chair:
PSA.1.2	But placeth his delight
PSA.1.2	Upon God's law, and meditates
PSA.1.2	on his law day and night.
PSA.1.3	He shall be like a tree that grows
PSA.1.3	near planted by a river,
PSA.1.3	Which in his season yields his fruit,
PSA.1.3	and his leaf fadeth never:
PSA.1.3	And all he doth shall prosper well
PSA.1.4	The wicked are not so;
PSA.1.4	But like they are unto the chaff,
PSA.1.4	which wind drives to and fro.
PSA.1.5	In judgment therefore shall not stand
PSA.1.5	such as ungodly are;
PSA.1.5	Nor in th' assembly of the just
PSA.1.5	shall wicked men appear.
PSA.1.6	For why? the way of godly men
PSA.1.6	unto the Lord is known:
PSA.1.6	Whereas the way of wicked men
PSA.1.6	shall quite be overthrown.
PSA.2.1	Why rage the heathen?
PSA.2.1	and vain things why do the people mind?
PSA.2.2	Kings of the earth do set themselves,
PSA.2.2	and princes are combin'd,
PSA.2.2	To plot against the Lord, and his
PSA.2.2	Anointed, saying thus,
PSA.2.3	Let us asunder break their bands,
PSA.2.3	and cast their cords from us.
PSA.2.4	He that in heaven sits shall laugh;
PSA.2.4	the Lord shall scorn them all.
PSA.2.5	Then shall he speak to them in wrath,
PSA.2.5	in rage he vex them shall.
PSA.2.6	Yet, notwithstanding,
PSA.2.6	I have him to be my King appointed;
PSA.2.6	And over Sion, my holy hill,
PSA.2.6	I have him King anointed.
PSA.2.7	The sure decree I will declare:
PSA.2.7	The Lord hath said to me,
PSA.2.7	Thou art mine only Son;
PSA.2.7	this day I have begotten thee.
PSA.2.8	Ask of me, and for heritage
PSA.2.8	the heathen I'll make thine;
PSA.2.8	And, for possession, I to thee
PSA.2.8	will give earth's utmost line.
PSA.2.9	Thou shalt, as with a weighty rod
PSA.2.9	of iron, break them all;
PSA.2.9	And, as a potter's sherd, thou shalt
PSA.2.9	them dash in pieces small.
PSA.2.10	Now therefore, kings, be wise;
PSA.2.10	be taught, ye judges of the earth:
PSA.2.11	Serve God in fear, and see that
PSA.2.11	ye join trembling with your mirth.
PSA.2.12	Kiss ye the Son, lest in his ire
PSA.2.12	ye perish from the way,
PSA.2.12	If once his wrath begin to burn:
PSA.2.12	bless'd all that on him stay.
PSA.3.1	O Lord, how are my foes increas'd?
PSA.3.1	against me many rise.
PSA.3.2	Many say of my soul, For him
PSA.3.2	in God no succour lies.
PSA.3.3	Yet thou my shield and glory art,
PSA.3.3	th' uplifter of mine head.
PSA.3.4	I cry'd, and, from his holy hill,
PSA.3.4	the Lord me answer made.
PSA.3.5	I laid me down and slept; I wak'd;
PSA.3.5	for God sustained me.
PSA.3.6	I will not fear though thousands ten
PSA.3.6	set round against me be.
PSA.3.7	Arise, O Lord; save me, my God;
PSA.3.7	for thou my foes hast stroke
PSA.3.7	All on the cheek-bone, and the teeth
PSA.3.7	of wicked men hast broke.
PSA.3.8	Salvation doth appertain
PSA.3.8	unto the Lord alone:
PSA.3.8	Thy blessing, Lord, for evermore
PSA.3.8	thy people is upon.
PSA.4.1	Give ear unto me when I call,
PSA.4.1	God of my righteousness:
PSA.4.1	Have mercy, hear my pray'r; thou hast
PSA.4.1	enlarg'd me in distress.
PSA.4.2	O ye the sons of men! how long
PSA.4.2	will ye love vanities?
PSA.4.2	How long my glory turn to shame,
PSA.4.2	and will ye follow lies?
PSA.4.3	But know, that for himself the Lord
PSA.4.3	the godly man doth choose:
PSA.4.3	The Lord, when I on him do call,
PSA.4.3	to hear will not refuse.
PSA.4.4	Fear, and sin not; talk with your heart on bed,
PSA.4.4	and silent be.
PSA.4.5	Off 'rings present of righteousness,
PSA.4.5	and in the Lord trust ye.
PSA.4.6	O who will shew us any good?
PSA.4.6	is that which many say:
PSA.4.6	But of thy countenance the light,
PSA.4.6	Lord, lift on us alway.
PSA.4.7	Upon my heart, bestow'd by thee,
PSA.4.7	more gladness I have found
PSA.4.7	Than they, ev'n then, when corn and wine
PSA.4.7	did most with them abound.
PSA.4.8	I will both lay me down in peace,
PSA.4.8	and quiet sleep will take;
PSA.4.8	Because thou only me to dwell
PSA.4.8	in safety, Lord, dost make.
PSA.5.1	Give ear unto my words, O Lord,
PSA.5.1	my meditation weigh.
PSA.5.2	Hear my loud cry, my King, my God;
PSA.5.2	for I to thee will pray.
PSA.5.3	Lord, thou shalt early hear my voice:
PSA.5.3	I early will direct
PSA.5.3	My pray'r to thee; and, looking up,
PSA.5.3	an answer will expect.
PSA.5.4	For thou art not a God that doth
PSA.5.4	in wickedness delight;
PSA.5.4	Neither shall evil dwell with thee,
PSA.5.5	Nor fools stand in thy sight.
PSA.5.5	All that ill-doers are thou hat'st;
PSA.5.6	Cutt'st off that liars be:
PSA.5.6	The bloody and deceitful man
PSA.5.6	abhorred is by thee.
PSA.5.7	But I into thy house will come
PSA.5.7	in thine abundant grace;
PSA.5.7	And I will worship in thy fear
PSA.5.7	toward thy holy place.
PSA.5.8	Because of those mine enemies,
PSA.5.8	Lord, in thy righteousness
PSA.5.8	Do thou me lead; do thou thy way
PSA.5.8	make straight before my face.
PSA.5.9	For in their mouth there is no truth,
PSA.5.9	their inward part is ill;
PSA.5.9	Their throat's an open sepulchre,
PSA.5.9	their tongue doth flatter still.
PSA.5.10	O God, destroy them; let them be
PSA.5.10	by their own counsel quell'd:
PSA.5.10	Them for their many sins cast out,
PSA.5.10	for they 'gainst thee rebell'd.
PSA.5.11	But let all joy that trust in thee,
PSA.5.11	and still make shouting noise;
PSA.5.11	For them thou sav'st; let all that love
PSA.5.11	thy name in thee rejoice.
PSA.5.12	For, Lord, unto the righteous man
PSA.5.12	thou wilt thy blessing yield:
PSA.5.12	With favour thou wilt compass him
PSA.5.12	about, as with a shield.
PSA.6.1	Lord, in thy wrath rebuke me not;
PSA.6.1	Nor in thy hot rage chasten me.
PSA.6.2	Lord, pity me, for I am weak:
PSA.6.2	Heal me, for my bones vexed be.
PSA.6.3	My soul is also vexed sore;
PSA.6.3	But, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make?
PSA.6.4	Return, O Lord, my soul set free;
PSA.6.4	O save me, for thy mercies' sake.
PSA.6.5	Because those that deceased are
PSA.6.5	Of thee shall no remembrance have;
PSA.6.5	And who is he that will to thee
PSA.6.5	Give praises lying in the grave?
PSA.6.6	I with my groaning weary am,
PSA.6.6	I also all the night my bed
PSA.6.6	Have caused for to swim; and I
PSA.6.6	With tears my couch have watered.
PSA.6.7	Mine eye, consum'd with grief, grows old,
PSA.6.7	Because of all mine enemies.
PSA.6.8	Hence from me, wicked workers all;
PSA.6.8	For God hath heard my weeping cries.
PSA.6.9	God hath my supplication heard,
PSA.6.9	My pray'r received graciously
PSA.6.10	Sham'd and sore vex'd be all my foes,
PSA.6.10	Sham'd and back turned suddenly.
PSA.7.1	O Lord my God, in thee do I
PSA.7.1	my confidence repose:
PSA.7.1	Save and deliver me from all
PSA.7.1	my persecuting foes;
PSA.7.2	Lest that the enemy my soul
PSA.7.2	should, like a lion, tear,
PSA.7.2	In pieces rending it, while there
PSA.7.2	is no deliverer.
PSA.7.3	O Lord my God, if it be so
PSA.7.3	that I committed this;
PSA.7.3	If it be so that in my hands
PSA.7.3	iniquity there is:
PSA.7.4	If I rewarded ill to him
PSA.7.4	that was at peace with me;
PSA.7.4	(Yea, ev'n the man that without cause
PSA.7.4	my foe was I did free;)
PSA.7.5	Then let the foe pursue and take
PSA.7.5	my soul, and my life thrust
PSA.7.5	Down to the earth,
PSA.7.5	and let him lay mine honour in the dust.
PSA.7.6	Rise in thy wrath, Lord, raise thyself,
PSA.7.6	for my foes raging be;
PSA.7.6	And, to the judgment which thou hast
PSA.7.6	commanded, wake for me.
PSA.7.7	So shall th' assembly of thy folk
PSA.7.7	about encompass thee:
PSA.7.7	Thou, therefore, for their sakes, return
PSA.7.7	unto thy place on high.
PSA.7.8	The Lord he shall the people judge:
PSA.7.8	my judge, 
PSA.7.8	After my righteousness, and mine
PSA.7.8	integrity in me.
PSA.7.9	O let the wicked's malice end;
PSA.7.9	but stablish stedfastly
PSA.7.9	The righteous: for the righteous God
PSA.7.9	the hearts and reins doth try.
PSA.7.10	In God, who saves th' upright in heart,
PSA.7.10	is my defence and stay.
PSA.7.11	God just men judgeth, God is wroth
PSA.7.11	with ill men ev'ry day.
PSA.7.12	If he do not return again,
PSA.7.12	then he his sword will whet;
PSA.7.12	His bow he hath already bent,
PSA.7.12	and hath it ready set:
PSA.7.13	He also hath for him prepar'd
PSA.7.13	the instruments of death;
PSA.7.13	Against the persecutors he
PSA.7.13	his shafts ordained hath.
PSA.7.14	Behold, he with iniquity
PSA.7.14	doth travail, as in birth;
PSA.7.14	A mischief he conceived hath,
PSA.7.14	and falsehood shall bring forth.
PSA.7.15	He made a pit and digg'd it deep,
PSA.7.15	another there to take;
PSA.7.15	But he is fall'n into the ditch
PSA.7.15	which he himself did make.
PSA.7.16	Upon his own head his mischief
PSA.7.16	shall be returned home;
PSA.7.16	His vi'lent dealing also down
PSA.7.16	on his own pate shall come.
PSA.7.17	According to his righteousness
PSA.7.17	the Lord I'll magnify;
PSA.7.17	And will sing praise unto the name
PSA.7.17	of God that is most high.
PSA.8.1	How excellent in all the earth,
PSA.8.1	Lord, our Lord, is thy name!
PSA.8.1	Who hast thy glory far advanc'd
PSA.8.1	above the starry frame.
PSA.8.2	From infants' and from sucklings' mouth
PSA.8.2	thou didest strength ordain,
PSA.8.2	For thy foes' cause, that so thou might'st
PSA.8.2	th' avenging foe restrain.
PSA.8.3	When I look up unto the heav'ns,
PSA.8.3	which thine own fingers fram'd,
PSA.8.3	Unto the moon, and to the stars,
PSA.8.3	which were by thee ordain'd;
PSA.8.4	Then say I, What is man, that he
PSA.8.4	remember'd is by thee?
PSA.8.4	Or what the son of man, that thou
PSA.8.4	so kind to him should'st be?
PSA.8.5	For thou a little lower hast
PSA.8.5	him than the angels made;
PSA.8.5	With glory and with dignity
PSA.8.5	thou crowned hast his head.
PSA.8.6	Of thy hands' works thou mad'st him lord,
PSA.8.6	all under's feet didst lay;
PSA.8.7	All sheep and oxen, yea, and beasts
PSA.8.7	that in the field do stray;
PSA.8.8	Fowls of the air, fish of the sea,
PSA.8.8	all that pass through the same.
PSA.8.9	How excellent in all the earth,
PSA.8.9	Lord, our Lord, is thy name!
PSA.9.1	Lord, thee I'll praise with all my heart,
PSA.9.1	thy wonders all proclaim.
PSA.9.2	In thee, most High, I'll greatly joy,
PSA.9.2	and sing unto thy name.
PSA.9.3	When back my foes were turn'd, they fell,
PSA.9.3	and perish'd at thy sight:
PSA.9.4	For thou maintain'dst my right and cause;
PSA.9.4	on throne sat'st judging right.
PSA.9.5	The heathen thou rebuked hast,
PSA.9.5	the wicked overthrown;
PSA.9.5	Thou hast put out their names, that they
PSA.9.5	may never more be known.
PSA.9.6	O en'my! now destructions have
PSA.9.6	an end perpetual:
PSA.9.6	Thou cities raz'd; perish'd with them
PSA.9.6	is their memorial.
PSA.9.7	God shall endure for aye; he doth
PSA.9.7	for judgment set his throne;
PSA.9.8	In righteousness to judge the world,
PSA.9.8	justice to give each one.
PSA.9.9	God also will a refuge be
PSA.9.9	for those that are oppress'd;
PSA.9.9	A refuge will he be in times
PSA.9.9	of trouble to distress'd.
PSA.9.10	And they that know thy name, in thee
PSA.9.10	their confidence will place:
PSA.9.10	For thou hast not forsaken them
PSA.9.10	that truly seek thy face.
PSA.9.11	O sing ye praises to the Lord,
PSA.9.11	that dwells in Sion hill;
PSA.9.11	And all the nations among
PSA.9.11	his deeds record ye still.
PSA.9.12	When he enquireth after blood,
PSA.9.12	he then rememb'reth them:
PSA.9.12	The humble folk he not forgets
PSA.9.12	that call upon his name.
PSA.9.13	Lord, pity me; behold the grief
PSA.9.13	which I from foes sustain;
PSA.9.13	Ev'n thou, who from the gates of death
PSA.9.13	dost raise me up again;
PSA.9.14	That I, in Sion's daughters' gates,
PSA.9.14	may all thy praise advance;
PSA.9.14	And that I may rejoice always
PSA.9.14	in thy deliverance.
PSA.9.15	The heathen are sunk in the pit
PSA.9.15	which they themselves prepar'd;
PSA.9.15	And in the net which they have hid
PSA.9.15	their own feet fast are snar'd.
PSA.9.16	The Lord is by the judgment known
PSA.9.16	which he himself hath wrought:
PSA.9.16	The sinners' hands do make the snares
PSA.9.16	wherewith themselves are caught.
PSA.9.17	They who are wicked into hell
PSA.9.17	each one shall turned be;
PSA.9.17	And all the nations that forget
PSA.9.17	to seek the Lord most high.
PSA.9.18	For they that needy are shall not
PSA.9.18	forgotten be alway;
PSA.9.18	The expectation of the poor
PSA.9.18	shall not be lost for aye.
PSA.9.19	Arise, Lord, let not man prevail;
PSA.9.19	judge heathen in thy sight:
PSA.9.20	That they may know themselves but men,
PSA.9.20	the nations, Lord, affright.
PSA.10.1	Wherefore is it that thou, O Lord,
PSA.10.1	dost stand from us afar?
PSA.10.1	And wherefore hidest thou thyself,
PSA.10.1	when times so troublous are?
PSA.10.2	The wicked in his loftiness
PSA.10.2	doth persecute the poor:
PSA.10.2	In these devices they have fram'd
PSA.10.2	let them be taken sure.
PSA.10.3	The wicked of his heart's desire
PSA.10.3	doth talk with boasting great;
PSA.10.3	He blesseth him that's covetous,
PSA.10.3	whom yet the Lord doth hate.
PSA.10.4	The wicked, through his pride of face,
PSA.10.4	on God he doth not call;
PSA.10.4	And in the counsels of his heart
PSA.10.4	the Lord is not at all.
PSA.10.5	His ways they always grievous are;
PSA.10.5	thy judgments from his sight
PSA.10.5	Removed are: at all his foes
PSA.10.5	he puffeth with despight.
PSA.10.6	Within his heart he thus hath said,
PSA.10.6	I shall not moved be;
PSA.10.6	And no adversity at all
PSA.10.6	shall ever come to me.
PSA.10.7	His mouth with cursing, fraud, deceit,
PSA.10.7	is fill'd abundantly;
PSA.10.7	And underneath his tongue there is
PSA.10.7	mischief and vanity.
PSA.10.8	He closely sits in villages;
PSA.10.8	he slays the innocent:
PSA.10.8	Against the poor that pass him by
PSA.10.8	his cruel eyes are bent.
PSA.10.9	He, lion-like, lurks in his den;
PSA.10.9	he waits the poor to take;
PSA.10.9	And when he draws him in his net,
PSA.10.9	his prey he doth him make.
PSA.10.10	Himself he humbleth very low,
PSA.10.10	he croucheth down withal,
PSA.10.10	That so a multitude of poor
PSA.10.10	may by his strong ones fall.
PSA.10.11	He thus hath said within his heart,
PSA.10.11	The Lord hath quite forgot;
PSA.10.11	He hides his countenance, and he
PSA.10.11	for ever sees it not.
PSA.10.12	O Lord, do thou arise; O God,
PSA.10.12	lift up thine hand on high:
PSA.10.12	Put not the meek afflicted ones
PSA.10.12	out of thy memory.
PSA.10.13	Why is it that the wicked man
PSA.10.13	thus doth the Lord despise?
PSA.10.13	Because that God will it require
PSA.10.13	he in his heart denies.
PSA.10.14	Thou hast it seen; for their mischief
PSA.10.14	and spite thou wilt repay:
PSA.10.14	The poor commits himself to thee;
PSA.10.14	thou art the orphan's stay.
PSA.10.15	The arm break of the wicked man,
PSA.10.15	and of the evil one;
PSA.10.15	Do thou seek out his wickedness,
PSA.10.15	until thou findest none.
PSA.10.16	The Lord is King through ages all,
PSA.10.16	ev'n to eternity;
PSA.10.16	The heathen people from his land
PSA.10.16	are perish'd utterly.
PSA.10.17	O Lord, of those that humble are
PSA.10.17	thou the desire didst hear;
PSA.10.17	Thou wilt prepare their heart, and thou
PSA.10.17	to hear wilt bend thine ear;
PSA.10.18	To judge the fatherless, and those
PSA.10.18	that are oppressed sore;
PSA.10.18	That man, that is but sprung of earth,
PSA.10.18	may them oppress no more.
PSA.11.1	I in the Lord do put my trust:
PSA.11.1	how is it then that ye
PSA.11.1	Say to my soul, Flee, as a bird,
PSA.11.1	unto your mountain high?
PSA.11.2	For, lo, the wicked bend their bow,
PSA.11.2	their shafts on string they fit,
PSA.11.2	That those who upright are in heart
PSA.11.2	they privily may hit.
PSA.11.3	If the foundations be destroy'd,
PSA.11.3	what hath the righteous done?
PSA.11.4	God in his holy temple is,
PSA.11.4	in heaven is his throne:
PSA.11.4	His eyes do see, his eye-lids try
PSA.11.5	men's sons. The just he proves:
PSA.11.5	But his soul hates the wicked man,
PSA.11.5	and him that vi'lence loves.
PSA.11.6	Snares, fire and brimstone, furious storms,
PSA.11.6	on sinners he shall rain:
PSA.11.6	This, as the portion of their cup,
PSA.11.6	doth unto them pertain.
PSA.11.7	Because the Lord most righteous doth
PSA.11.7	in righteousness delight;
PSA.11.7	And with a pleasant countenance
PSA.11.7	beholdeth the upright.
PSA.12.1	Help, Lord, because the godly man
PSA.12.1	doth daily fade away;
PSA.12.1	And from among the sons of men
PSA.12.1	the faithful do decay.
PSA.12.2	Unto his neighbour ev'ry one
PSA.12.2	doth utter vanity:
PSA.12.2	They with a double heart do speak,
PSA.12.2	and lips of flattery.
PSA.12.3	God shall cut off all flatt'ring lips,
PSA.12.3	tongues that speak proudly thus,
PSA.12.4	We'll with our tongue prevail, our lips
PSA.12.4	are ours: who's lord o'er us?
PSA.12.5	For poor oppress'd,
PSA.12.5	and for the sighs of needy, rise will
PSA.12.5	I, Saith God, and him in safety set
PSA.12.5	from such as him defy.
PSA.12.6	The words of God are words most pure;
PSA.12.6	they be like silver try'd
PSA.12.6	In earthen furnace, seven times
PSA.12.6	that hath been purify'd.
PSA.12.7	Lord, thou shalt them preserve and keep
PSA.12.7	for ever from this race.
PSA.12.8	On each side walk the wicked, when
PSA.12.8	vile men are high in place.
PSA.13.1	How long wilt thou forget me, Lord?
PSA.13.1	shall it for ever be?
PSA.13.1	O how long shall it be that thou
PSA.13.1	wilt hide thy face from me?
PSA.13.2	How long take counsel in my soul,
PSA.13.2	still sad in heart, shall I?
PSA.13.2	How long exalted over me
PSA.13.2	Shall be mine enemy?
PSA.13.3	O Lord my God, consider well,
PSA.13.3	and answer to me make:
PSA.13.3	Mine eyes enlighten, lest the sleep
PSA.13.3	of death me overtake:
PSA.13.4	Lest that mine enemy should say,
PSA.13.4	Against him I prevail'd;
PSA.13.4	And those that trouble me rejoice,
PSA.13.4	when I am mov'd and fail'd.
PSA.13.5	But I have all my confidence
PSA.13.5	thy mercy set upon;
PSA.13.5	My heart within me shall rejoice
PSA.13.5	in thy salvation.
PSA.13.6	I will unto the Lord my God
PSA.13.6	sing praises cheerfully,
PSA.13.6	Because he hath his bounty shown
PSA.13.6	to me abundantly.
PSA.14.1	That there is not a God, the fool
PSA.14.1	doth in his heart conclude:
PSA.14.1	They are corrupt, their works are vile;
PSA.14.1	not one of them doth good.
PSA.14.2	Upon men's sons the Lord from heav'n
PSA.14.2	did cast his eyes abroad,
PSA.14.2	To see if any understood,
PSA.14.2	and did seek after God.
PSA.14.3	They altogether filthy are,
PSA.14.3	they all aside are gone;
PSA.14.3	And there is none that doeth good,
PSA.14.3	yea, sure there is not one.
PSA.14.4	These workers of iniquity
PSA.14.4	do they not know at all,
PSA.14.4	That they my people eat as bread,
PSA.14.4	and on God do not call?
PSA.14.5	There fear'd they much; for God is with
PSA.14.5	the whole race of the just.
PSA.14.6	You shame the counsel of the poor,
PSA.14.6	because God is his trust.
PSA.14.7	Let Isr'el's help from Sion come:
PSA.14.7	when back the Lord shall bring
PSA.14.7	His captives, Jacob shall rejoice,
PSA.14.7	and Israel shall sing.
PSA.15.1	Within thy tabernacle, Lord,
PSA.15.1	who shall abide with thee?
PSA.15.1	And in thy high and holy hill
PSA.15.1	who shall a dweller be?
PSA.15.2	The man that walketh uprightly,
PSA.15.2	and worketh righteousness,
PSA.15.2	And as he thinketh in his heart,
PSA.15.2	so doth he truth express.
PSA.15.3	Who doth not slander with his tongue,
PSA.15.3	nor to his friend doth hurt;
PSA.15.3	Nor yet against his neighbour doth
PSA.15.3	take up an ill report.
PSA.15.4	In whose eyes vile men are despis'd;
PSA.15.4	but those that God do fear
PSA.15.4	He honoureth; and changeth not,
PSA.15.4	though to his hurt he swear.
PSA.15.5	His coin puts not to usury,
PSA.15.5	nor take reward will he
PSA.15.5	Against the guiltless. Who doth
PSA.15.5	thus shall never moved be.
PSA.16.1	Lord, keep me; for I trust in thee.
PSA.16.2	To God thus was my speech,
PSA.16.2	Thou art my Lord; and unto thee
PSA.16.2	my goodness doth not reach:
PSA.16.3	To saints on earth, to th' excellent,
PSA.16.3	where my delight's all plac'd.
PSA.16.4	Their sorrows shall be multiply'd
PSA.16.4	to other gods that haste:
PSA.16.4	Of their drink-offerings of blood
PSA.16.4	I will no off 'ring make;
PSA.16.4	Yea, neither I their very names
PSA.16.4	up in my lips will take.
PSA.16.5	God is of mine inheritance
PSA.16.5	and cup the portion;
PSA.16.5	The lot that fallen is to me
PSA.16.5	thou dost maintain alone.
PSA.16.6	Unto me happily the lines
PSA.16.6	in pleasant places fell;
PSA.16.6	Yea, the inheritance I got
PSA.16.6	in beauty doth excel.
PSA.16.7	I bless the Lord, because he doth
PSA.16.7	by counsel me conduct;
PSA.16.7	And in the seasons of the night
PSA.16.7	my reins do me instruct.
PSA.16.8	Before me still the Lord I set:
PSA.16.8	sith it is so that he
PSA.16.8	Doth ever stand at my right hand,
PSA.16.8	I shall not moved be.
PSA.16.9	Because of this my heart is glad,
PSA.16.9	and joy shall be exprest
PSA.16.9	Ev'n by my glory; and my flesh
PSA.16.9	in confidence shall rest.
PSA.16.10	Because my soul in grave to dwell
PSA.16.10	shall not be left by thee;
PSA.16.10	Nor wilt thou give thine Holy One
PSA.16.10	corruption to see.
PSA.16.11	Thou wilt me shew the path of life:
PSA.16.11	of joys there is full store
PSA.16.11	Before thy face; at thy right hand
PSA.16.11	are pleasures evermore.
PSA.17.1	Lord, hear the right, attend my cry,
PSA.17.1	unto my pray'r give heed,
PSA.17.1	That doth not in hypocrisy
PSA.17.1	from feigned lips proceed.
PSA.17.2	And from before thy presence forth
PSA.17.2	my sentence do thou send:
PSA.17.2	Toward these things that equal are
PSA.17.2	do thou thine eyes intend.
PSA.17.3	Thou prov'dst mine heart, thou visit'dst me
PSA.17.3	by night, thou didst me try,
PSA.17.3	Yet nothing found'st; for that my mouth
PSA.17.3	shall not sin, purpos'd I.
PSA.17.4	As for men's works, I, by the word
PSA.17.4	that from thy lips doth flow,
PSA.17.4	Did me preserve out of the paths
PSA.17.4	wherein destroyers go.
PSA.17.5	Hold up my goings,
PSA.17.5	Lord, me guide
PSA.17.5	in those thy paths divine,
PSA.17.5	So that my footsteps may not slide
PSA.17.5	out of those ways of thine.
PSA.17.6	I called have on thee, O God,
PSA.17.6	because thou wilt me hear:
PSA.17.6	That thou may'st hearken to my speech,
PSA.17.6	to me incline thine ear.
PSA.17.7	Thy wondrous loving-kindness show,
PSA.17.7	thou that, by thy right hand,
PSA.17.7	Sav'st them that trust in thee from those
PSA.17.7	that up against them stand.
PSA.17.8	As th' apple of the eye me keep;
PSA.17.8	in thy wings shade me close
PSA.17.9	From lewd oppressors, compassing
PSA.17.9	me round, as deadly foes.
PSA.17.10	In their own fat they are inclos'd;
PSA.17.10	their mouth speaks loftily.
PSA.17.11	Our steps they compass'd; and to ground
PSA.17.11	down bowing set their eye.
PSA.17.12	He like unto a lion is
PSA.17.12	that's greedy of his prey,
PSA.17.12	Or lion young, which lurking doth
PSA.17.12	in secret places stay.
PSA.17.13	Arise, and disappoint my foe,
PSA.17.13	and cast him down,
PSA.17.13	O Lord: My soul save from the wicked man,
PSA.17.13	the man which is thy sword.
PSA.17.14	From men, which are thy hand, O Lord,
PSA.17.14	from worldly men me save,
PSA.17.14	Which only in this present life
PSA.17.14	their part and portion have.
PSA.17.14	Whose belly with thy treasure hid
PSA.17.14	thou fill'st: they children have
PSA.17.14	In plenty; of their goods the rest
PSA.17.14	they to their children leave.
PSA.17.15	But as for me, I thine own face
PSA.17.15	in righteousness will see;
PSA.17.15	And with thy likeness, when I wake,
PSA.17.15	I satisfy'd shall be.
PSA.18.1	Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength.
PSA.18.2	My fortress is the Lord,
PSA.18.2	My rock, and he that doth to me
PSA.18.2	deliverance afford:
PSA.18.2	My God, my strength, whom I will trust,
PSA.18.2	a buckler unto me,
PSA.18.2	The horn of my salvation,
PSA.18.2	and my high tow'r, is he.
PSA.18.3	Upon the Lord, who worthy is
PSA.18.3	of praises, will I cry;
PSA.18.3	And then shall I preserved be
PSA.18.3	safe from mine enemy.
PSA.18.4	Floods of ill men affrighted me,
PSA.18.4	death's pangs about me went;
PSA.18.5	Hell's sorrows me environed;
PSA.18.5	death's snares did me prevent.
PSA.18.6	In my distress I call'd on God,
PSA.18.6	cry to my God did I;
PSA.18.6	He from his temple heard my voice,
PSA.18.6	to his ears came my cry.
PSA.18.7	Th' earth, as affrighted, then did shake,
PSA.18.7	trembling upon it seiz'd:
PSA.18.7	The hills' foundations moved were,
PSA.18.7	because he was displeas'd.
PSA.18.8	Up from his nostrils came a smoke,
PSA.18.8	and from his mouth there came
PSA.18.8	Devouring fire, and coals by it
PSA.18.8	were turned into flame.
PSA.18.9	He also bowed down the heav'ns,
PSA.18.9	and thence he did descend;
PSA.18.9	And thickest clouds of darkness did
PSA.18.9	under his feet attend.
PSA.18.10	And he upon a cherub rode,
PSA.18.10	and thereon he did fly;
PSA.18.10	Yea, on the swift wings of the wind
PSA.18.10	his flight was from on high.
PSA.18.11	He darkness made his secret place:
PSA.18.11	about him, for his tent,
PSA.18.11	Dark waters were, and thickest clouds
PSA.18.11	of th' airy firmament.
PSA.18.12	And at the brightness of that light,
PSA.18.12	which was before his eye,
PSA.18.12	His thick clouds pass'd away, hailstones
PSA.18.12	and coals of fire did fly.
PSA.18.13	The Lord God also in the heav'ns
PSA.18.13	did thunder in his ire;
PSA.18.13	And there the Highest gave his voice,
PSA.18.13	hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.14	Yea, he his arrows sent abroad,
PSA.18.14	and them he scattered;
PSA.18.14	His lightnings also he shot out,
PSA.18.14	and them discomfited.
PSA.18.15	The waters' channels then were seen,
PSA.18.15	the world's foundations vast
PSA.18.15	At thy rebuke discover'd were,
PSA.18.15	and at thy nostrils' blast.
PSA.18.16	And from above the Lord sent down,
PSA.18.16	and took me from below;
PSA.18.16	From many waters he me drew,
PSA.18.16	which would me overflow.
PSA.18.17	He me reliev'd from my strong foes,
PSA.18.17	and such as did me hate;
PSA.18.17	Because he saw that they for me
PSA.18.17	too strong were, and too great.
PSA.18.18	They me prevented in the day
PSA.18.18	of my calamity;
PSA.18.18	But even then the Lord himself
PSA.18.18	a stay was unto me.
PSA.18.19	He to a place where liberty
PSA.18.19	and room was hath me brought;
PSA.18.19	Because he took delight in me,
PSA.18.19	he my deliv'rance wrought.
PSA.18.20	According to my righteousness
PSA.18.20	he did me recompense,
PSA.18.20	He me repaid according to
PSA.18.20	my hands' pure innocence.
PSA.18.21	For I God's ways kept, from my God
PSA.18.21	did not turn wickedly.
PSA.18.22	His judgments were before me, I
PSA.18.22	his laws put not from me.
PSA.18.23	Sincere before him was my heart;
PSA.18.23	with him upright was I;
PSA.18.23	And watchfully I kept myself
PSA.18.23	from mine iniquity.
PSA.18.24	After my righteousness the Lord
PSA.18.24	hath recompensed me,
PSA.18.24	After the cleanness of my hands
PSA.18.24	appearing in his eye.
PSA.18.25	Thou gracious to the gracious art,
PSA.18.25	to upright men upright:
PSA.18.26	Pure to the pure, froward thou kyth'st
PSA.18.26	unto the froward wight.
PSA.18.27	For thou wilt the afflicted save
PSA.18.27	in grief that low do lie:
PSA.18.27	But wilt bring down the countenance
PSA.18.27	of them whose looks are high.
PSA.18.28	The Lord will light my candle so,
PSA.18.28	that it shall shine full bright:
PSA.18.28	The Lord my God will also make
PSA.18.28	my darkness to be light.
PSA.18.29	By thee through troops of men I break,
PSA.18.29	and them discomfit all;
PSA.18.29	And, by my God assisting me,
PSA.18.29	I overleap a wall.
PSA.18.30	As for God, perfect is his way:
PSA.18.30	the Lord his word is try'd;
PSA.18.30	He is a buckler to all those
PSA.18.30	who do in him confide.
PSA.18.31	Who but the Lord is God? but he
PSA.18.31	who is a rock and stay?
PSA.18.32	'Tis God that girdeth me with strength,
PSA.18.32	and perfect makes my way.
PSA.18.33	He made my feet swift as the hinds,
PSA.18.33	set me on my high places.
PSA.18.34	Mine hands to war he taught, mine arms
PSA.18.34	brake bows of steel in pieces.
PSA.18.35	The shield of thy salvation
PSA.18.35	thou didst on me bestow:
PSA.18.35	Thy right hand held me up, and great
PSA.18.35	thy kindness made me grow.
PSA.18.36	And in my way my steps thou hast
PSA.18.36	enlarged under me,
PSA.18.36	That I go safely, and my feet
PSA.18.36	are kept from sliding free.
PSA.18.37	Mine en'mies I pursued have,
PSA.18.37	and did them overtake;
PSA.18.37	Nor did I turn again till I
PSA.18.37	an end of them did make.
PSA.18.38	I wounded them, they could not rise;
PSA.18.38	they at my feet did fall.
PSA.18.39	Thou girdedst me with strength for war;
PSA.18.39	my foes thou brought'st down all:
PSA.18.40	And thou hast giv'n to me the necks
PSA.18.40	of all mine enemies;
PSA.18.40	That I might them destroy and slay,
PSA.18.40	who did against me rise.
PSA.18.41	They cried out, but there was none
PSA.18.41	that would or could them save;
PSA.18.41	Yea, they did cry unto the Lord,
PSA.18.41	but he no answer gave.
PSA.18.42	Then did I beat them small as dust
PSA.18.42	before the wind that flies;
PSA.18.42	And I did cast them out like dirt
PSA.18.42	upon the street that lies.
PSA.18.43	Thou mad'st me free from people's strife,
PSA.18.43	and heathen's head to be:
PSA.18.43	A people whom I have not known
PSA.18.43	shall service do to me.
PSA.18.44	At hearing they shall me obey,
PSA.18.44	to me they shall submit.
PSA.18.45	Strangers for fear shall fade away,
PSA.18.45	who in close places sit.
PSA.18.46	God lives, bless'd be my Rock; the God
PSA.18.46	of my health praised be.
PSA.18.47	God doth avenge me, and subdues
PSA.18.47	the people under me.
PSA.18.48	He saves me from mine enemies;
PSA.18.48	yea, thou hast lifted me
PSA.18.48	Above my foes; and from the man
PSA.18.48	of vi'lence set me free.
PSA.18.49	Therefore to thee will I give thanks
PSA.18.49	the heathen folk among;
PSA.18.49	And to thy name, O Lord, I will
PSA.18.49	sing praises in a song.
PSA.18.50	He great deliv'rance gives his king:
PSA.18.50	he mercy doth extend
PSA.18.50	To David, his anointed one,
PSA.18.50	and his seed without end.
PSA.19.1	The heav'ns God's glory do declare,
PSA.19.1	the skies his hand-works preach:
PSA.19.2	Day utters speech to day, and night
PSA.19.2	to night doth knowledge teach.
PSA.19.3	There is no speech nor tongue to which
PSA.19.3	their voice doth not extend:
PSA.19.4	Their line is gone through all the earth,
PSA.19.4	their words to the world's end.
PSA.19.4	In them he set the sun a tent;
PSA.19.5	Who, bridegroom-like, forth goes
PSA.19.5	From's chamber, as a strong man doth
PSA.19.5	to run his race rejoice.
PSA.19.6	From heav'n's end is his going forth,
PSA.19.6	circling to th' end again;
PSA.19.6	And there is nothing from his heat
PSA.19.6	that hidden doth remain.
PSA.19.7	God's law is perfect, and converts
PSA.19.7	the soul in sin that lies:
PSA.19.7	God's testimony is most sure,
PSA.19.7	and makes the simple wise.
PSA.19.8	The statutes of the Lord are right,
PSA.19.8	and do rejoice the heart:
PSA.19.8	The Lord's command is pure, and doth
PSA.19.8	light to the eyes impart.
PSA.19.9	Unspotted is the fear of God,
PSA.19.9	and doth endure for ever:
PSA.19.9	The judgments of the Lord are true
PSA.19.9	and righteous altogether.
PSA.19.10	They more than gold, yea, much fine gold,
PSA.19.10	to be desired are:
PSA.19.10	Than honey, honey from the comb
PSA.19.10	that droppeth, sweeter far.
PSA.19.11	Moreover, they thy servant warn
PSA.19.11	how he his life should frame:
PSA.19.11	A great reward provided is
PSA.19.11	for them that keep the same.
PSA.19.12	Who can his errors understand?
PSA.19.12	O cleanse thou me within
PSA.19.13	From secret faults. Thy servant keep
PSA.19.13	from all presumptuous sin:
PSA.19.13	And do not suffer them to have
PSA.19.13	dominion over me:
PSA.19.13	Then, righteous and innocent,
PSA.19.13	I from much sin shall be.
PSA.19.14	The words which from my mouth proceed,
PSA.19.14	the thoughts sent from my heart,
PSA.19.14	Accept, O Lord, for thou my strength
PSA.19.14	and my Redeemer art.
PSA.20.1	when trouble he doth send:
PSA.20.1	And let the name of Jacob's God
PSA.20.1	thee from all ill defend.
PSA.20.2	O let him help send from above,
PSA.20.2	out of his sanctuary:
PSA.20.2	From Sion, his own holy hill,
PSA.20.2	let him give strength to thee.
PSA.20.3	Let him remember all thy gifts,
PSA.20.3	accept thy sacrifice:
PSA.20.4	Grant thee thine heart's wish, and fulfil
PSA.20.4	thy thoughts and counsel wise.
PSA.20.5	In thy salvation we will joy;
PSA.20.5	in our God's name we will
PSA.20.5	Display our banners: and the Lord
PSA.20.5	thy prayers all fulfil.
PSA.20.6	Now know I God his king doth save:
PSA.20.6	he from his holy heav'n
PSA.20.6	Will hear him, with the saving strength
PSA.20.6	by his own right hand giv'n.
PSA.20.7	In chariots some put confidence,
PSA.20.7	some horses trust upon:
PSA.20.7	But we remember will the name
PSA.20.7	of our Lord God alone.
PSA.20.8	We rise, and upright stand, when they
PSA.20.8	are bowed down, and fall.
PSA.20.9	Deliver, Lord; and let the King
PSA.20.9	us hear, when we do call.
PSA.21.1	The king in thy great strength, O Lord,
PSA.21.1	shall very joyful be:
PSA.21.1	In thy salvation rejoice
PSA.21.1	how veh'mently shall he!
PSA.21.2	Thou hast bestowed upon him
PSA.21.2	all that his heart would have;
PSA.21.2	And thou from him didst not withhold
PSA.21.2	whate'er his lips did crave.
PSA.21.3	For thou with blessings him prevent'st
PSA.21.3	of goodness manifold;
PSA.21.3	And thou hast set upon his head
PSA.21.3	a crown of purest gold.
PSA.21.4	When he desired life of thee,
PSA.21.4	thou life to him didst give;
PSA.21.4	Ev'n such a length of days,
PSA.21.4	that he for evermore should live.
PSA.21.5	In that salvation wrought by thee
PSA.21.5	his glory is made great;
PSA.21.5	Honour and comely majesty
PSA.21.5	thou hast upon him set.
PSA.21.6	Because that thou for evermore
PSA.21.6	most blessed hast him made;
PSA.21.6	And thou hast with thy countenance
PSA.21.6	made him exceeding glad.
PSA.21.7	Because the king upon the Lord
PSA.21.7	his confidence doth lay;
PSA.21.7	And through the grace of the most High
PSA.21.7	shall not be mov'd away.
PSA.21.8	Thine hand shall all those men find out
PSA.21.8	that en'mies are to thee;
PSA.21.8	Ev'n thy right hand shall find out those
PSA.21.8	of thee that haters be.
PSA.21.9	Like fiery ov'n thou shalt them make,
PSA.21.9	when kindled is thine ire;
PSA.21.9	God shall them swallow in his wrath,
PSA.21.9	devour them shall the fire.
PSA.21.10	Their fruit from earth thou shalt destroy,
PSA.21.10	their seed men from among:
PSA.21.11	For they beyond their might 'gainst thee
PSA.21.11	did plot mischief and wrong.
PSA.21.12	Thou therefore shalt make them turn back,
PSA.21.12	when thou thy shafts shalt place
PSA.21.12	Upon thy strings, made ready all
PSA.21.12	to fly against their face.
PSA.21.13	In thy great pow'r and strength, O Lord,
PSA.21.13	be thou exalted high;
PSA.21.13	So shall we sing with joyful hearts,
PSA.21.13	thy power praise shall we.
PSA.22.1	My God, my God, why hast thou me
PSA.22.1	forsaken? why so far
PSA.22.1	Art thou from helping me, and from
PSA.22.1	my words that roaring are?
PSA.22.2	All day, my God, to thee I cry,
PSA.22.2	yet am not heard by thee;
PSA.22.2	And in the season of the night
PSA.22.2	I cannot silent be.
PSA.22.3	But thou art holy, thou that dost
PSA.22.3	inhabit Isr'el's praise.
PSA.22.4	Our fathers hop'd in thee, they hop'd
PSA.22.4	and thou didst them release.
PSA.22.5	When unto thee they sent their cry,
PSA.22.5	to them deliv'rance came:
PSA.22.5	Because they put their trust in thee,
PSA.22.5	they were not put to shame.
PSA.22.6	But as for me, a worm I am,
PSA.22.6	and as no man am priz'd:
PSA.22.6	Reproach of men I am, and by
PSA.22.6	the people am despis'd.
PSA.22.7	All that me see laugh me to scorn;
PSA.22.7	shoot out the lip do they;
PSA.22.7	They nod and shake their heads at me,
PSA.22.7	and, mocking, thus do say,
PSA.22.8	This man did trust in God, that he
PSA.22.8	would free him by his might:
PSA.22.8	Let him deliver him, sith he
PSA.22.8	had in him such delight.
PSA.22.9	But thou art he out of the womb
PSA.22.9	that didst me safely take;
PSA.22.9	When I was on my mother's breasts
PSA.22.9	thou me to hope didst make.
PSA.22.10	And I was cast upon thy care,
PSA.22.10	ev'n from the womb till now;
PSA.22.10	And from my mother's belly, Lord,
PSA.22.10	my God and guide art thou.
PSA.22.11	Be not far off, for grief is near,
PSA.22.11	and none to help is found.
PSA.22.12	Bulls many compass me, strong bulls
PSA.22.12	of Bashan me surround.
PSA.22.13	Their mouths they open'd wide on me,
PSA.22.13	upon me gape did they,
PSA.22.13	Like to a lion ravening
PSA.22.13	and roaring for his prey.
PSA.22.14	Like water I'm pour'd out, my bones
PSA.22.14	all out of joint do part:
PSA.22.14	Amidst my bowels, as the wax,
PSA.22.14	so melted is my heart.
PSA.22.15	My strength is like a potsherd dry'd;
PSA.22.15	my tongue it cleaveth fast
PSA.22.15	Unto my jaws; and to the dust
PSA.22.15	of death thou brought me hast.
PSA.22.16	For dogs have compass'd me about:
PSA.22.16	the wicked, that did meet
PSA.22.16	In their assembly, me inclos'd;
PSA.22.16	they pierc'd my hands and feet.
PSA.22.17	I all my bones may tell; they do
PSA.22.17	upon me look and stare.
PSA.22.18	Upon my vesture lots they cast,
PSA.22.18	and clothes among them share.
PSA.22.19	But be not far, O Lord, my strength;
PSA.22.19	haste to give help to me.
PSA.22.20	From sword my soul, from pow'r of dogs
PSA.22.20	my darling set thou free.
PSA.22.21	Out of the roaring lion's mouth
PSA.22.21	do thou me shield and save:
PSA.22.21	For from the horns of unicorns
PSA.22.21	an ear to me thou gave.
PSA.22.22	I will shew forth thy name unto
PSA.22.22	those that my brethren are;
PSA.22.22	Amidst the congregation
PSA.22.22	thy praise I will declare.
PSA.22.23	Praise ye the Lord, who do him fear;
PSA.22.23	him glorify all ye
PSA.22.23	The seed of Jacob: fear him all
PSA.22.23	that Isr'el's children be.
PSA.22.24	For he despis'd not nor abhorr'd
PSA.22.24	th' afflicted's misery;
PSA.22.24	Nor from him hid his face, but heard
PSA.22.24	when he to him did cry.
PSA.22.25	Within the congregation great
PSA.22.25	my praise shall be of thee;
PSA.22.25	My vows before them that him fear
PSA.22.25	shall be perform'd by me.
PSA.22.26	The meek shall eat,
PSA.22.26	and shall be fill'd;
PSA.22.26	they also praise shall give
PSA.22.26	Unto the Lord that do him seek:
PSA.22.26	your heart shall ever live.
PSA.22.27	All ends of th' earth remember shall,
PSA.22.27	and turn the Lord unto;
PSA.22.27	All kindreds of the nations
PSA.22.27	to him shall homage do:
PSA.22.28	Because the kingdom to the Lord
PSA.22.28	doth appertain as his;
PSA.22.28	Likewise among the nations
PSA.22.28	the Governor he is.
PSA.22.29	Earth's fat ones eat,
PSA.22.29	and worship shall:
PSA.22.29	all who to dust descend
PSA.22.29	Shall bow to him; none of them can
PSA.22.29	his soul from death defend.
PSA.22.30	A seed shall service do to him;
PSA.22.30	unto the Lord it shall
PSA.22.30	Be for a generation
PSA.22.30	reckon'd in ages all.
PSA.22.31	They shall come, and they shall declare
PSA.22.31	his truth and righteousness
PSA.22.31	Unto a people yet unborn,
PSA.22.31	and that he hath done this.
PSA.23.1	The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want.
PSA.23.2	He makes me down to lie
PSA.23.2	In pastures green: he leadeth me
PSA.23.2	the quiet waters by.
PSA.23.3	My soul he doth restore again;
PSA.23.3	and me to walk doth make
PSA.23.3	Within the paths of righteousness,
PSA.23.3	ev'n for his own name's sake.
PSA.23.4	Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
PSA.23.4	yet will I fear none ill:
PSA.23.4	For thou art with me; and thy rod
PSA.23.4	and staff me comfort still.
PSA.23.5	My table thou hast furnished
PSA.23.5	in presence of my foes;
PSA.23.5	My head thou dost with oil anoint,
PSA.23.5	and my cup overflows.
PSA.23.6	Goodness and mercy all my life
PSA.23.6	shall surely follow me:
PSA.23.6	And in God's house for evermore
PSA.23.6	my dwelling-place shall be.
PSA.24.1	The earth belongs unto the Lord,
PSA.24.1	and all that it contains;
PSA.24.1	The world that is inhabited,
PSA.24.1	and all that there remains.
PSA.24.2	For the foundations thereof
PSA.24.2	he on the seas did lay,
PSA.24.2	And he hath it established
PSA.24.2	upon the floods to stay.
PSA.24.3	Who is the man that shall ascend
PSA.24.3	into the hill of God?
PSA.24.3	Or who within his holy place
PSA.24.3	shall have a firm abode?
PSA.24.4	Whose hands are clean, whose heart is pure,
PSA.24.4	and unto vanity
PSA.24.4	Who hath not lifted up his soul,
PSA.24.4	nor sworn deceitfully.
PSA.24.5	He from th' Eternal shall receive
PSA.24.5	the blessing him upon,
PSA.24.5	And righteousness, ev'n from the God
PSA.24.5	of his salvation.
PSA.24.6	This is the generation
PSA.24.6	that after him enquire,
PSA.24.6	O Jacob, who do seek thy face
PSA.24.6	with their whole heart's desire.
PSA.24.7	Ye gates, lift up your heads on high;
PSA.24.7	ye doors that last for aye,
PSA.24.7	Be lifted up, that so the King
PSA.24.7	of glory enter may.
PSA.24.8	But who of glory is the King?
PSA.24.8	The mighty Lord is this;
PSA.24.8	Ev'n that same Lord, that great in might
PSA.24.8	and strong in battle is.
PSA.24.9	Ye gates, lift up your heads; ye doors,
PSA.24.9	doors that do last for aye,
PSA.24.9	Be lifted up, that so the King
PSA.24.9	of glory enter may.
PSA.24.10	But who is he that is the King
PSA.24.10	of glory? who is this?
PSA.24.10	The Lord of hosts, and none but he,
PSA.24.10	the King of glory is.
PSA.25.1	To thee I lift my soul:
PSA.25.2	O Lord, I trust in thee:
PSA.25.2	My God, let me not be asham'd,
PSA.25.2	nor foes triumph o'er me.
PSA.25.3	Let none that wait on thee
PSA.25.3	be put to shame at all;
PSA.25.3	But those that without cause transgress,
PSA.25.3	let shame upon them fall.
PSA.25.4	Shew me thy ways, O Lord;
PSA.25.4	thy paths, O teach thou me:
PSA.25.5	And do thou lead me in thy truth,
PSA.25.5	therein my teacher be:
PSA.25.5	For thou art God that dost
PSA.25.5	to me salvation send,
PSA.25.5	And I upon thee all the day
PSA.25.5	expecting do attend.
PSA.25.6	Thy tender mercies, Lord,
PSA.25.6	I pray thee to remember,
PSA.25.6	And loving-kindnesses; for they
PSA.25.6	have been of old for ever.
PSA.25.7	My sins and faults of youth
PSA.25.7	do thou, O Lord, forget:
PSA.25.7	After thy mercy think on me,
PSA.25.7	and for thy goodness great.
PSA.25.8	God good and upright is:
PSA.25.8	the way he'll sinners show.
PSA.25.9	The meek in judgment he will guide,
PSA.25.9	and make his path to know.
PSA.25.10	The whole paths of the Lord
PSA.25.10	are truth and mercy sure,
PSA.25.10	To those that do his cov'nant keep,
PSA.25.10	and testimonies pure.
PSA.25.11	Now, for thine own name's sake,
PSA.25.11	O Lord, I thee entreat
PSA.25.11	To pardon mine iniquity;
PSA.25.11	for it is very great.
PSA.25.12	What man is he that fears
PSA.25.12	the Lord, and doth him serve?
PSA.25.12	Him shall he teach the way that he
PSA.25.12	shall choose, and still observe.
PSA.25.13	His soul shall dwell at ease;
PSA.25.13	and his posterity
PSA.25.13	Shall flourish still, and of the earth
PSA.25.13	inheritors shall be.
PSA.25.14	With those that fear him is
PSA.25.14	the secret of the Lord;
PSA.25.14	The knowledge of his covenant
PSA.25.14	he will to them afford.
PSA.25.15	Mine eyes upon the Lord
PSA.25.15	continually are set:
PSA.25.15	For he it is that shall bring forth
PSA.25.15	my feet out of the net.
PSA.25.16	Turn unto me thy face,
PSA.25.16	and to me mercy show;
PSA.25.16	Because that I am desolate,
PSA.25.16	and am brought very low.
PSA.25.17	My heart's griefs are increas'd:
PSA.25.17	me from distress relieve.
PSA.25.18	See mine affliction and my pain,
PSA.25.18	and all my sins forgive.
PSA.25.19	Consider thou my foes,
PSA.25.19	because they many are;
PSA.25.19	And it a cruel hatred is
PSA.25.19	which they against me bear.
PSA.25.20	O do thou keep my soul,
PSA.25.20	do thou deliver me:
PSA.25.20	And let me never be asham'd,
PSA.25.20	because I trust in thee.
PSA.25.21	Let uprightness and truth
PSA.25.21	keep me, who thee attend.
PSA.25.22	Redemption, Lord, to Israel
PSA.25.22	from all his troubles send.
PSA.26.1	Judge me, O Lord, for I have walk'd
PSA.26.1	in mine integrity:
PSA.26.1	I trusted also in the Lord;
PSA.26.1	slide therefore shall not I.
PSA.26.2	Examine me, and do me prove;
PSA.26.2	try heart and reins, O God:
PSA.26.3	For thy love is before mine eyes,
PSA.26.3	thy truth's paths I have trode.
PSA.26.4	With persons vain I have not sat,
PSA.26.4	nor with dissemblers gone:
PSA.26.5	Th' assembly of ill men I hate;
PSA.26.5	to sit with such I shun.
PSA.26.6	Mine hands in innocence, O Lord,
PSA.26.6	I'll wash and purify;
PSA.26.6	So to thine holy altar go,
PSA.26.6	and compass it will I:
PSA.26.7	That I, with voice of thanksgiving,
PSA.26.7	may publish and declare,
PSA.26.7	And tell of all thy mighty works,
PSA.26.7	that great and wondrous are.
PSA.26.8	The habitation of thy house,
PSA.26.8	Lord, I have loved well;
PSA.26.8	Yea, in that place I do delight
PSA.26.8	where doth thine honour dwell.
PSA.26.9	With sinners gather not my soul,
PSA.26.9	and such as blood would spill:
PSA.26.10	Whose hands mischievous plots, right hand
PSA.26.10	corrupting bribes do fill.
PSA.26.11	But as for me, I will walk on
PSA.26.11	in mine integrity:
PSA.26.11	Do thou redeem me, and, O Lord,
PSA.26.11	be merciful to me.
PSA.26.12	My foot upon an even place
PSA.26.12	doth stand with stedfastness:
PSA.26.12	Within the congregations
PSA.26.12	th' Eternal I will bless.
PSA.27.1	The Lord's my light and saving health,
PSA.27.1	who shall make me dismay'd?
PSA.27.1	My life's strength is the Lord, of whom
PSA.27.1	then shall I be afraid?
PSA.27.2	When as mine enemies and foes,
PSA.27.2	most wicked persons all,
PSA.27.2	To eat my flesh against me rose,
PSA.27.2	they stumbled and did fall.
PSA.27.3	Against me though an host encamp,
PSA.27.3	my heart yet fearless is:
PSA.27.3	Though war against me rise, I will
PSA.27.3	be confident in this.
PSA.27.4	One thing I of the Lord desir'd,
PSA.27.4	and will seek to obtain,
PSA.27.4	That all days of my life I may
PSA.27.4	within God's house remain;
PSA.27.4	That I the beauty of the Lord
PSA.27.4	behold may and admire,
PSA.27.4	And that I in his holy place
PSA.27.4	may rev'rently enquire.
PSA.27.5	For he in his pavilion shall
PSA.27.5	me hide in evil days;
PSA.27.5	In secret of his tent me hide,
PSA.27.5	and on a rock me raise.
PSA.27.6	And now, ev'n at this present time,
PSA.27.6	mine head shall lifted be
PSA.27.6	Above all those that are my foes,
PSA.27.6	and round encompass me:
PSA.27.6	Therefore unto his tabernacle
PSA.27.6	I'll sacrifices bring
PSA.27.6	Of joyfulness; I'll sing, yea, I
PSA.27.6	to God will praises sing.
PSA.27.7	O Lord, give ear unto my voice,
PSA.27.7	when I do cry to thee;
PSA.27.7	Upon me also mercy have,
PSA.27.7	and do thou answer me.
PSA.27.8	When thou didst say, Seek ye my face,
PSA.27.8	then unto thee reply
PSA.27.8	Thus did my heart, Above all things
PSA.27.8	thy face, Lord, seek will I.
PSA.27.9	Far from me hide not thou thy face;
PSA.27.9	put not away from thee
PSA.27.9	Thy servant in thy wrath: thou hast
PSA.27.9	an helper been to me.
PSA.27.9	O God of my salvation,
PSA.27.9	leave me not, nor forsake:
PSA.27.10	Though me my parents both should leave,
PSA.27.10	the Lord will me up take.
PSA.27.11	O Lord, instruct me in thy way,
PSA.27.11	to me a leader be
PSA.27.11	In a plain path, because of those
PSA.27.11	that hatred bear to me.
PSA.27.12	Give me not to mine en'mies' will;
PSA.27.12	for witnesses that lie
PSA.27.12	Against me risen are, and such
PSA.27.12	as breathe out cruelty.
PSA.27.13	I fainted had, unless that I
PSA.27.13	believed had to see
PSA.27.13	The Lord's own goodness in the land
PSA.27.13	of them that living be.
PSA.27.14	Wait on the Lord, and be thou strong,
PSA.27.14	and he shall strength afford
PSA.27.14	Unto thine heart; yea, do thou wait,
PSA.27.14	I say, upon the Lord.
PSA.28.1	To thee I'll cry, O Lord, my rock;
PSA.28.1	hold not thy peace to me;
PSA.28.1	Lest like those that to pit descend
PSA.28.1	I by thy silence be.
PSA.28.2	The voice hear of my humble pray'rs,
PSA.28.2	when unto thee I cry;
PSA.28.2	When to thine holy oracle
PSA.28.2	I lift mine hands on high.
PSA.28.3	With ill men draw me not away
PSA.28.3	that work iniquity;
PSA.28.3	That speak peace to their friends, while in
PSA.28.3	their hearts doth mischief lie.
PSA.28.4	Give them according to their deeds
PSA.28.4	and ills endeavoured:
PSA.28.4	And as their handy-works deserve,
PSA.28.4	to them be rendered.
PSA.28.5	God shall not build, but them destroy,
PSA.28.5	who would not understand
PSA.28.5	The Lord's own works, nor did regard
PSA.28.5	the doing of his hand.
PSA.28.6	For ever blessed be the Lord,
PSA.28.6	for graciously he heard
PSA.28.6	The voice of my petitions,
PSA.28.6	and prayers did regard.
PSA.28.7	The Lord's my strength and shield; my heart
PSA.28.7	upon him did rely;
PSA.28.7	And I am helped: hence my heart
PSA.28.7	doth joy exceedingly,
PSA.28.7	And with my song I will him praise.
PSA.28.8	Their strength is God alone:
PSA.28.8	He also is the saving strength
PSA.28.8	of his anointed one.
PSA.28.9	O thine own people do thou save,
PSA.28.9	bless thine inheritance;
PSA.28.9	Them also do thou feed, and them
PSA.28.9	for evermore advance.
PSA.29.1	Give ye unto the Lord, ye sons
PSA.29.1	that of the mighty be,
PSA.29.1	All strength and glory to the Lord
PSA.29.1	with cheerfulness give ye.
PSA.29.2	Unto the Lord the glory give
PSA.29.2	that to his name is due;
PSA.29.2	And in the beauty of holiness
PSA.29.2	unto 
PSA.29.3	The Lord's voice on the waters is;
PSA.29.3	the God of majesty
PSA.29.3	Doth thunder, and on multitudes
PSA.29.3	of waters sitteth he.
PSA.29.4	A pow'rful voice it is that comes
PSA.29.4	out from the Lord most high;
PSA.29.4	The voice of that great Lord is full
PSA.29.4	of glorious majesty.
PSA.29.5	The voice of the Eternal doth
PSA.29.5	asunder cedars tear;
PSA.29.5	Yea, God the Lord doth cedars break
PSA.29.5	that Lebanon doth bear.
PSA.29.6	He makes them like a calf to skip,
PSA.29.6	ev'n that great Lebanon,
PSA.29.6	And, like to a young unicorn,
PSA.29.6	the mountain Sirion.
PSA.29.7	God's voice divides the flames of fire;
PSA.29.8	The desert it doth shake:
PSA.29.8	The Lord doth make the wilderness
PSA.29.8	of Kadesh all to quake.
PSA.29.9	God's voice doth make the hinds to calve,
PSA.29.9	it makes the forest bare:
PSA.29.9	And in his temple ev'ry one
PSA.29.9	his glory doth declare.
PSA.29.10	The Lord sits on the floods; the Lord
PSA.29.10	sits King, and ever shall.
PSA.29.11	The Lord will give his people strength,
PSA.29.11	and with peace bless them all.
PSA.30.1	Lord, I will thee extol, for thou
PSA.30.1	hast lifted me on high,
PSA.30.1	And over me thou to rejoice
PSA.30.1	mad'st not mine enemy.
PSA.30.2	O thou who art the Lord my God,
PSA.30.2	I in distress to thee,
PSA.30.2	With loud cries lifted up my voice,
PSA.30.2	and thou hast healed me.
PSA.30.3	O Lord, my soul thou hast brought up,
PSA.30.3	and rescu'd from the grave;
PSA.30.3	That I to pit should not go down,
PSA.30.3	alive thou didst me save.
PSA.30.4	O ye that are his holy ones,
PSA.30.4	sing praise unto the Lord;
PSA.30.4	And give unto him thanks, when ye
PSA.30.4	his holiness record.
PSA.30.5	For but a moment lasts his wrath;
PSA.30.5	life in his favour lies:
PSA.30.5	Weeping may for a night endure,
PSA.30.5	at morn doth joy arise.
PSA.30.6	In my prosperity I said,
PSA.30.6	that nothing shall me move.
PSA.30.7	O Lord, thou hast my mountain made
PSA.30.7	to stand strong by thy love:
PSA.30.7	But when that thou,
PSA.30.7	O gracious God,
PSA.30.7	didst hide thy face from me,
PSA.30.7	Then quickly was my prosp'rous state
PSA.30.7	turn'd into misery.
PSA.30.8	Wherefore unto the Lord my cry
PSA.30.8	I caused to ascend:
PSA.30.8	My humble supplication
PSA.30.8	I to the Lord did send.
PSA.30.9	What profit is there in my blood,
PSA.30.9	when I go down to pit?
PSA.30.9	Shall unto thee the dust give praise?
PSA.30.9	thy truth declare shall it?
PSA.30.10	Hear, Lord, have mercy; help me, Lord:
PSA.30.11	Thou turned hast my sadness
PSA.30.11	To dancing; yea, my sackcloth loos'd,
PSA.30.11	and girded me with gladness;
PSA.30.12	That sing thy praise my glory may,
PSA.30.12	and never silent be.
PSA.30.12	O Lord my God, for evermore
PSA.30.12	I will give thanks to thee.
PSA.31.1	In thee, O Lord, I put my trust,
PSA.31.1	sham'd let me never be;
PSA.31.1	According to thy righteousness
PSA.31.1	do thou deliver me.
PSA.31.2	Bow down thine ear to me, with speed
PSA.31.2	send me deliverance:
PSA.31.2	To save me, my strong rock be thou,
PSA.31.2	and my house of defence.
PSA.31.3	Because thou art my rock, and thee
PSA.31.3	I for my fortress take;
PSA.31.3	Therefore do thou me lead and guide,
PSA.31.3	ev'n for thine own name's sake.
PSA.31.4	And sith thou art my strength, therefore
PSA.31.4	pull me out of the net,
PSA.31.4	Which they in subtilty for me
PSA.31.4	so privily have set.
PSA.31.5	Into thine hands I do commit
PSA.31.5	my sp'rit: for thou art he,
PSA.31.5	O thou, 
PSA.31.5	that hast redeemed me.
PSA.31.6	Those that do lying vanities
PSA.31.6	regard, I have abhorr'd:
PSA.31.6	But as for me, my confidence
PSA.31.6	is fixed on the Lord.
PSA.31.7	I'll in thy mercy gladly joy:
PSA.31.7	for thou my miseries
PSA.31.7	Consider'd hast; thou hast my soul
PSA.31.7	known in adversities:
PSA.31.8	And thou hast not inclosed me
PSA.31.8	within the en'my's hand;
PSA.31.8	And by thee have my feet been made
PSA.31.8	in a large room to stand.
PSA.31.9	O Lord, upon me mercy have,
PSA.31.9	for trouble is on me:
PSA.31.9	Mine eye, my belly, and my soul,
PSA.31.9	with grief consumed be.
PSA.31.10	Because my life with grief is spent,
PSA.31.10	my years with sighs and groans:
PSA.31.10	My strength doth fail; and for my sin
PSA.31.10	consumed are my bones.
PSA.31.11	I was a scorn to all my foes,
PSA.31.11	and to my friends a fear;
PSA.31.11	And specially reproach'd of those
PSA.31.11	that were my neighbours near:
PSA.31.11	When they me saw they from me fled.
PSA.31.12	Ev'n so I am forgot,
PSA.31.12	As men are out of mind when dead:
PSA.31.12	I'm like a broken pot.
PSA.31.13	For slanders I of many heard;
PSA.31.13	fear compass'd me, while they
PSA.31.13	Against me did consult, and plot
PSA.31.13	to take my life away.
PSA.31.14	But as for me, O Lord, my trust
PSA.31.14	upon thee I did lay;
PSA.31.14	And I to thee, Thou art my God,
PSA.31.14	did confidently say.
PSA.31.15	My times are wholly in thine hand:
PSA.31.15	do thou deliver me
PSA.31.15	From their hands that mine enemies
PSA.31.15	and persecutors be.
PSA.31.16	Thy countenance to shine do thou
PSA.31.16	upon thy servant make:
PSA.31.16	Unto me give salvation,
PSA.31.16	for thy great mercies' sake.
PSA.31.17	Let me not be asham'd, O Lord,
PSA.31.17	for on thee call'd I have:
PSA.31.17	Let wicked men be sham'd, let them
PSA.31.17	be silent in the grave.
PSA.31.18	To silence put the lying lips,
PSA.31.18	that grievous things do say,
PSA.31.18	And hard reports, in pride and scorn,
PSA.31.18	on righteous men do lay.
PSA.31.19	How great's the goodness thou for them
PSA.31.19	that fear thee keep'st in store,
PSA.31.19	And wrought'st for them that trust in thee
PSA.31.19	the sons of men before!
PSA.31.20	In secret of thy presence thou
PSA.31.20	shalt hide them from man's pride:
PSA.31.20	From strife of tongues thou closely shalt,
PSA.31.20	as in a tent, them hide.
PSA.31.21	All praise and thanks be to the Lord;
PSA.31.21	for he hath magnify'd
PSA.31.21	His wondrous love to me within
PSA.31.21	a city fortify'd.
PSA.31.22	For from thine eyes cut off I am,
PSA.31.22	I in my haste had said;
PSA.31.22	My voice yet heard'st thou, when to thee
PSA.31.22	with cries my moan I made.
PSA.31.23	O love the Lord, all ye his saints;
PSA.31.23	because the Lord doth guard
PSA.31.23	The faithful, and he plenteously
PSA.31.23	proud doers doth reward.
PSA.31.24	Be of good courage, and he strength
PSA.31.24	unto your heart shall send,
PSA.31.24	All ye whose hope and confidence
PSA.31.24	doth on the Lord depend.
PSA.32.1	O blessed is the man to whom
PSA.32.1	is freely pardoned
PSA.32.1	All the transgression he hath done,
PSA.32.1	whose sin is covered.
PSA.32.2	Bless'd is the man to whom the Lord
PSA.32.2	imputeth not his sin,
PSA.32.2	And in whose sp'rit there is no guile,
PSA.32.2	nor fraud is found therein.
PSA.32.3	When as I did refrain my speech,
PSA.32.3	and silent was my tongue,
PSA.32.3	My bones then waxed old, because
PSA.32.3	I roared all day long.
PSA.32.4	For upon me both day and night
PSA.32.4	thine hand did heavy lie,
PSA.32.4	So that my moisture turned is
PSA.32.4	in summer's drought thereby.
PSA.32.5	I thereupon have unto thee
PSA.32.5	my sin acknowledged,
PSA.32.5	And likewise mine iniquity
PSA.32.5	I have not covered:
PSA.32.5	I will confess unto the Lord
PSA.32.5	my trespasses, said I;
PSA.32.5	And of my sin thou freely didst
PSA.32.5	forgive th' iniquity.
PSA.32.6	For this shall ev'ry godly one
PSA.32.6	his prayer make to thee;
PSA.32.6	In such a time he shall thee seek,
PSA.32.6	as found thou mayest be.
PSA.32.6	Surely, when floods of waters great
PSA.32.6	do swell up to the brim,
PSA.32.6	They shall not overwhelm his soul,
PSA.32.6	nor once come near to him.
PSA.32.7	Thou art my hiding-place, thou shalt
PSA.32.7	from trouble keep me free:
PSA.32.7	Thou with songs of deliverance
PSA.32.7	about shalt compass me.
PSA.32.8	I will instruct thee, and thee teach
PSA.32.8	the way that thou shalt go;
PSA.32.8	And, with mine eye upon thee set,
PSA.32.8	I will direction show.
PSA.32.9	Then be not like the horse or mule,
PSA.32.9	which do not understand;
PSA.32.9	Whose mouth, lest they come near to thee,
PSA.32.9	a bridle must command.
PSA.32.10	Unto the man that wicked is
PSA.32.10	his sorrows shall abound;
PSA.32.10	But him that trusteth in the Lord
PSA.32.10	mercy shall compass round.
PSA.32.11	Ye righteous, in the Lord be glad,
PSA.32.11	in him do ye rejoice:
PSA.32.11	All ye that upright are in heart,
PSA.32.11	for joy lift up your voice.
PSA.33.1	Ye righteous, in the Lord rejoice;
PSA.33.1	it comely is and right,
PSA.33.1	That upright men, with thankful voice,
PSA.33.1	should praise the Lord of might.
PSA.33.2	Praise God with harp, and unto him
PSA.33.2	sing with the psaltery;
PSA.33.2	Upon a ten-string'd instrument
PSA.33.2	make ye sweet melody.
PSA.33.3	A new song to him sing, and play
PSA.33.3	with loud noise skilfully;
PSA.33.4	For right is God's word, all his works
PSA.33.4	are done in verity.
PSA.33.5	To judgment and to righteousness
PSA.33.5	a love he beareth still;
PSA.33.5	The loving-kindness of the Lord
PSA.33.5	the earth throughout doth fill.
PSA.33.6	The heavens by the word of God
PSA.33.6	did their beginning take;
PSA.33.6	And by the breathing of his mouth
PSA.33.6	he all their hosts did make.
PSA.33.7	The waters of the seas he brings
PSA.33.7	together as an heap;
PSA.33.7	And in storehouses, as it were,
PSA.33.7	he layeth up the deep.
PSA.33.8	Let earth, and all that live therein,
PSA.33.8	with rev'rence fear the Lord;
PSA.33.8	Let all the world's inhabitants
PSA.33.8	dread him with one accord.
PSA.33.9	For he did speak the word, and done
PSA.33.9	it was without delay;
PSA.33.9	Established it firmly stood,
PSA.33.9	whatever he did say.
PSA.33.10	God doth the counsel bring to nought
PSA.33.10	which heathen folk do take;
PSA.33.10	And what the people do devise
PSA.33.10	of none effect doth make.
PSA.33.11	O but the counsel of the Lord
PSA.33.11	doth stand for ever sure;
PSA.33.11	And of his heart the purposes
PSA.33.11	from age to age endure.
PSA.33.12	That nation blessed is, whose God
PSA.33.12	A blessed people are, whom for
PSA.33.12	his heritage he chose.
PSA.33.13	The Lord from heav'n sees and beholds
PSA.33.13	all sons of men full well:
PSA.33.14	He views all from his dwelling-place
PSA.33.14	that in the earth do dwell.
PSA.33.15	He forms their hearts alike, and all
PSA.33.15	their doings he observes.
PSA.33.16	Great hosts save not a king, much strength
PSA.33.16	no mighty man preserves.
PSA.33.17	An horse for preservation
PSA.33.17	is a deceitful thing;
PSA.33.17	And by the greatness of his strength
PSA.33.17	can no deliv'rance bring.
PSA.33.18	Behold on those that do him fear
PSA.33.18	the Lord doth set his eye;
PSA.33.18	Ev'n those who on his mercy do
PSA.33.18	with confidence rely.
PSA.33.19	From death to free their soul, in dearth
PSA.33.19	life unto them to yield.
PSA.33.20	Our soul doth wait upon the Lord;
PSA.33.20	he is our help and shield.
PSA.33.21	Sith in his holy name we trust,
PSA.33.21	our heart shall joyful be.
PSA.33.22	Lord, let thy mercy be on us,
PSA.33.22	as we do hope in thee.
PSA.34.1	God will I bless all times; his praise
PSA.34.1	my mouth shall still express.
PSA.34.2	My soul shall boast in God: the meek
PSA.34.2	shall hear with joyfulness.
PSA.34.3	Extol the Lord with me, let us
PSA.34.3	exalt his name together.
PSA.34.4	I sought the Lord, he heard, and did
PSA.34.4	me from all fears deliver.
PSA.34.5	They look'd to him, and lighten'd were:
PSA.34.5	not shamed were their faces.
PSA.34.6	This poor man cry'd, God heard, and sav'd
PSA.34.6	him from all his distresses.
PSA.34.7	The angel of the Lord encamps,
PSA.34.7	and round encompasseth
PSA.34.7	All those about that do him fear,
PSA.34.7	and them delivereth.
PSA.34.8	O taste and see that God is good:
PSA.34.8	who trusts in him is bless'd.
PSA.34.9	Fear God his saints: none that him fear
PSA.34.9	shall be with want oppress'd.
PSA.34.10	The lions young may hungry be,
PSA.34.10	and they may lack their food:
PSA.34.10	But they that truly seek the Lord
PSA.34.10	shall not lack any good.
PSA.34.11	O children, hither do ye come,
PSA.34.11	and unto me give ear;
PSA.34.11	I shall you teach to understand
PSA.34.11	how ye the Lord should fear.
PSA.34.12	What man is he that life desires,
PSA.34.12	to see good would live long?
PSA.34.13	Thy lips refrain from speaking guile,
PSA.34.13	and from ill words thy tongue.
PSA.34.14	Depart from ill, do good, seek peace,
PSA.34.14	pursue it earnestly.
PSA.34.15	God's eyes are on the just; his ears
PSA.34.15	are open to their cry.
PSA.34.16	The face of God is set against
PSA.34.16	those that do wickedly,
PSA.34.16	That he may quite out from the earth
PSA.34.16	cut off their memory.
PSA.34.17	The righteous cry unto the Lord,
PSA.34.17	he unto them gives ear;
PSA.34.17	And they out of their troubles all
PSA.34.17	by him deliver'd are.
PSA.34.18	The Lord is ever nigh to them
PSA.34.18	that be of broken sp'rit;
PSA.34.18	To them he safety doth afford
PSA.34.18	that are in heart contrite.
PSA.34.19	The troubles that afflict the just
PSA.34.19	in number many be;
PSA.34.19	But yet at length out of them all
PSA.34.19	the Lord doth set him free.
PSA.34.20	He carefully his bones doth keep,
PSA.34.20	whatever can befall;
PSA.34.20	That not so much as one of them
PSA.34.20	can broken be at all.
PSA.34.21	Ill shall the wicked slay; laid waste
PSA.34.21	shall be who hate the just.
PSA.34.22	The Lord redeems his servants' souls;
PSA.34.22	none perish that him trust.
PSA.35.1	Plead, Lord, with those that plead; and fight
PSA.35.1	with those that fight with me.
PSA.35.2	Of shield and buckler take thou hold,
PSA.35.2	stand up mine help to be.
PSA.35.3	Draw also out the spear, and do
PSA.35.3	against them stop the way
PSA.35.3	That me pursue: unto my soul,
PSA.35.3	I'm thy salvation, say.
PSA.35.4	Let them confounded be and sham'd
PSA.35.4	that for my soul have sought:
PSA.35.4	Who plot my hurt turn'd back be they,
PSA.35.4	and to confusion brought.
PSA.35.5	Let them be like unto the chaff
PSA.35.5	that flies before the wind;
PSA.35.5	And let the angel of the Lord
PSA.35.5	pursue them hard behind.
PSA.35.6	With darkness cover thou their way,
PSA.35.6	and let it slipp'ry prove;
PSA.35.6	And let the angel of the Lord
PSA.35.6	pursue them from above.
PSA.35.7	For without cause have they for me
PSA.35.7	their net hid in a pit,
PSA.35.7	They also have without a cause
PSA.35.7	for my soul digged it.
PSA.35.8	Let ruin seize him unawares;
PSA.35.8	his net he hid withal
PSA.35.8	Himself let catch; and in the same
PSA.35.8	destruction let him fall.
PSA.35.9	My soul in God shall joy; and glad
PSA.35.9	in his salvation be:
PSA.35.10	And all my bones shall say, O Lord,
PSA.35.10	who is like unto thee,
PSA.35.10	Which dost the poor set free from him
PSA.35.10	that is for him too strong;
PSA.35.10	The poor and needy from the man
PSA.35.10	that spoils and does him wrong?
PSA.35.11	False witnesses rose; to my charge
PSA.35.11	things I not knew they laid.
PSA.35.12	They, to the spoiling of my soul,
PSA.35.12	me ill for good repaid.
PSA.35.13	But as for me, when they were sick,
PSA.35.13	in sackcloth sad I mourn'd:
PSA.35.13	My humbled soul did fast, my pray'r
PSA.35.13	into my bosom turn'd.
PSA.35.14	Myself I did behave as he
PSA.35.14	had been my friend or brother;
PSA.35.14	I heavily bow'd down, as one
PSA.35.14	that mourneth for his mother.
PSA.35.15	But in my trouble they rejoic'd,
PSA.35.15	gath'ring themselves together;
PSA.35.15	Yea, abjects vile together did
PSA.35.15	themselves against me gather:
PSA.35.15	I knew it not; they did me tear,
PSA.35.15	and quiet would not be.
PSA.35.16	With mocking hypocrites, at feasts
PSA.35.16	they gnash'd their teeth at me.
PSA.35.17	How long, Lord, look'st thou on? from those
PSA.35.17	destructions they intend
PSA.35.17	Rescue my soul, from lions young
PSA.35.17	my darling do defend.
PSA.35.18	I will give thanks to thee, O Lord,
PSA.35.18	within th' assembly great;
PSA.35.18	And where much people gather'd are
PSA.35.18	thy praises forth will set.
PSA.35.19	Let not my wrongful enemies
PSA.35.19	proudly rejoice o'er me;
PSA.35.19	Nor who me hate without a cause,
PSA.35.19	let them wink with the eye.
PSA.35.20	For peace they do not speak at all;
PSA.35.20	but crafty plots prepare
PSA.35.20	Against all those within the land
PSA.35.20	that meek and quiet are.
PSA.35.21	With mouths set wide, they 'gainst me said,
PSA.35.21	Ha, ha! our eye doth see.
PSA.35.22	Lord, thou hast seen, hold not thy peace;
PSA.35.22	Lord, be not far from me.
PSA.35.23	Stir up thyself; wake, that thou may'st
PSA.35.23	judgment to me afford,
PSA.35.23	Ev'n to my cause, O thou that art
PSA.35.23	my only God and Lord.
PSA.35.24	O Lord my God, do thou me judge
PSA.35.24	after thy righteousness;
PSA.35.24	And let them not their joy 'gainst me
PSA.35.24	triumphantly express:
PSA.35.25	Nor let them say within their hearts,
PSA.35.25	Ah, we would have it thus;
PSA.35.25	Nor suffer them to say, that he
PSA.35.25	is swallow'd up by us.
PSA.35.26	Sham'd and confounded be they all
PSA.35.26	that at my hurt are glad;
PSA.35.26	Let those against me that do boast
PSA.35.26	with shame and scorn be clad.
PSA.35.27	Let them that love my righteous cause
PSA.35.27	be glad, shout, and not cease
PSA.35.27	To say, The Lord be magnify'd,
PSA.35.27	who loves his servant's peace.
PSA.35.28	Thy righteousness shall also be
PSA.35.28	declared by my tongue;
PSA.35.28	The praises that belong to thee
PSA.35.28	speak shall it all day long.
PSA.36.1	The wicked man's transgression
PSA.36.1	within my heart thus says,
PSA.36.1	Undoubtedly the fear of God
PSA.36.1	is not before his eyes.
PSA.36.2	Because himself he flattereth
PSA.36.2	in his own blinded eye,
PSA.36.2	Until the hatefulness be found
PSA.36.2	of his iniquity.
PSA.36.3	Words from his mouth proceeding are,
PSA.36.3	fraud and iniquity:
PSA.36.3	He to be wise, and to do good,
PSA.36.3	hath left off utterly.
PSA.36.4	He mischief, lying on his bed,
PSA.36.4	most cunningly doth plot:
PSA.36.4	He sets himself in ways not good,
PSA.36.4	ill he abhorreth not.
PSA.36.5	Thy mercy, Lord, is in the heav'ns;
PSA.36.5	thy truth doth reach the clouds:
PSA.36.6	Thy justice is like mountains great;
PSA.36.6	thy judgments deep as floods:
PSA.36.6	Lord, thou preservest man and beast.
PSA.36.7	How precious is thy grace!
PSA.36.7	Therefore in shadow of thy wings
PSA.36.7	men's sons their trust shall place.
PSA.36.8	They with the fatness of thy house
PSA.36.8	shall be well satisfy'd;
PSA.36.8	From rivers of thy pleasures thou
PSA.36.8	wilt drink to them provide.
PSA.36.9	Because of life the fountain pure
PSA.36.9	remains alone with thee;
PSA.36.9	And in that purest light of thine
PSA.36.9	we clearly light shall see.
PSA.36.10	Thy loving-kindness unto them
PSA.36.10	continue that thee know;
PSA.36.10	And still on men upright in heart
PSA.36.10	thy righteousness bestow.
PSA.36.11	Let not the foot of cruel pride
PSA.36.11	come, and against me stand;
PSA.36.11	And let me not removed be,
PSA.36.11	Lord, by the wicked's hand.
PSA.36.12	There fallen are they, and ruined,
PSA.36.12	that work iniquities:
PSA.36.12	Cast down they are, and never shall
PSA.36.12	be able to arise.
PSA.37.1	For evil-doers fret thou not
PSA.37.1	thyself unquietly;
PSA.37.1	Nor do thou envy bear to those
PSA.37.1	that work iniquity.
PSA.37.2	For, even like unto the grass,
PSA.37.2	soon be cut down shall they;
PSA.37.2	And, like the green and tender herb,
PSA.37.2	they wither shall away.
PSA.37.3	Set thou thy trust upon the Lord,
PSA.37.3	and be thou doing good;
PSA.37.3	And so thou in the land shalt dwell,
PSA.37.3	and verily have food.
PSA.37.4	Delight thyself in God; he'll give
PSA.37.4	thine heart's desire to thee.
PSA.37.5	Thy way to God commit, him trust,
PSA.37.5	it bring to pass shall he.
PSA.37.6	And, like unto the light, he shall
PSA.37.6	thy righteousness display;
PSA.37.6	And he thy judgment shall bring forth
PSA.37.6	like noon-tide of the day.
PSA.37.7	Rest in the Lord, and patiently
PSA.37.7	wait for him: do not fref
PSA.37.7	For him who, prosp'ring in his way,
PSA.37.7	success in sin doth get.
PSA.37.8	Do thou from anger cease, and wrath
PSA.37.8	see thou forsake also:
PSA.37.8	Fret not thyself in any wise,
PSA.37.8	that evil thou should'st do.
PSA.37.9	For those that evil doers are
PSA.37.9	shall be cut off and fall:
PSA.37.9	But those that wait upon the Lord
PSA.37.9	the earth inherit shall.
PSA.37.10	For yet a little while, and then
PSA.37.10	the wicked shall not be;
PSA.37.10	His place thou shalt consider well,
PSA.37.10	but it thou shalt not see.
PSA.37.11	But by inheritance the earth
PSA.37.11	the meek ones shall possess:
PSA.37.11	They also shall delight themselves
PSA.37.11	in an abundant peace.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plots against the just,
PSA.37.12	and at him whets his teeth:
PSA.37.13	The Lord shall laugh at him, because
PSA.37.13	his day he coming seeth.
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn out the sword,
PSA.37.14	and bent their bow, to slay
PSA.37.14	The poor and needy, and to kill
PSA.37.14	men of an upright way.
PSA.37.15	But their own sword, which they have drawn,
PSA.37.15	shall enter their own heart:
PSA.37.15	Their bows which they have bent shall break,
PSA.37.15	and into pieces part.
PSA.37.16	A little that a just man hath
PSA.37.16	is more and better far
PSA.37.16	Than is the wealth of many such
PSA.37.16	as lewd and wicked are.
PSA.37.17	For sinners' arms shall broken be;
PSA.37.17	but God the just sustains.
PSA.37.18	God knows the just man's days, and still
PSA.37.18	their heritage remains.
PSA.37.19	They shall not be asham'd when they
PSA.37.19	the evil time do see;
PSA.37.19	And when the days of famine are,
PSA.37.19	they satisfy'd shall be.
PSA.37.20	But wicked men, and foes of God,
PSA.37.20	as fat of lambs, decay;
PSA.37.20	They shall consume, yea, into smoke
PSA.37.20	they shall consume away.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrows, but the same
PSA.37.21	again he doth not pay;
PSA.37.21	Whereas the righteous mercy shews,
PSA.37.21	and gives his own away.
PSA.37.22	For such as blessed be of him
PSA.37.22	the earth inherit shall;
PSA.37.22	And they that cursed are of him
PSA.37.22	shall be destroyed all.
PSA.37.23	A good man's footsteps by the Lord
PSA.37.23	are ordered aright;
PSA.37.23	And in the way wherein he walks
PSA.37.23	he greatly doth delight.
PSA.37.24	Although he fall, yet shall he not
PSA.37.24	be cast down utterly;
PSA.37.24	Because the Lord with his own hand
PSA.37.24	upholds him mightily.
PSA.37.25	I have been young, and now am old,
PSA.37.25	yet have I never seen
PSA.37.25	The just man left, nor that his seed
PSA.37.25	for bread have beggars been.
PSA.37.26	He's ever merciful, and lends:
PSA.37.26	his seed is bless'd therefore.
PSA.37.27	Depart from evil, and do good,
PSA.37.27	and dwell for evermore.
PSA.37.28	For God loves judgment, and his saints
PSA.37.28	leaves not in any case;
PSA.37.28	They are kept ever: but cut off
PSA.37.28	shall be the sinner's race.
PSA.37.29	The just inherit shall the land,
PSA.37.29	and ever in it dwell:
PSA.37.30	The just man's mouth doth wisdom speak;
PSA.37.30	his tongue doth judgment tell.
PSA.37.31	In's heart the law is of his God,
PSA.37.31	his steps slide not away.
PSA.37.32	The wicked man doth watch the just,
PSA.37.32	and seeketh him to slay.
PSA.37.33	Yet him the Lord will not forsake,
PSA.37.33	nor leave him in his hands:
PSA.37.33	The righteous will he not condemn,
PSA.37.33	when he in judgment stands.
PSA.37.34	Wait on the Lord, and keep his way,
PSA.37.34	and thee exalt shall he
PSA.37.34	Th' earth to inherit; when cut off
PSA.37.34	the wicked thou shalt see.
PSA.37.35	I saw the wicked great in pow'r,
PSA.37.35	spread like a green bay-tree:
PSA.37.36	He pass'd, yea, was not; him I sought,
PSA.37.36	but found he could not be.
PSA.37.37	Mark thou the perfect, and behold
PSA.37.37	the man of uprightness;
PSA.37.37	Because that surely of this man
PSA.37.37	the latter end is peace.
PSA.37.38	But those men that transgressors are
PSA.37.38	shall be destroy'd together;
PSA.37.38	The latter end of wicked men
PSA.37.38	shall be cut off for ever.
PSA.37.39	But the salvation of the just
PSA.37.39	is from the Lord above;
PSA.37.39	He in the time of their distress
PSA.37.39	their stay and strength doth prove.
PSA.37.40	The Lord shall help, and them deliver:
PSA.37.40	he shall them free and save
PSA.37.40	From wicked men; because in him
PSA.37.40	their confidence they have.
PSA.38.1	In thy great indignation,
PSA.38.1	O Lord, rebuke me not;
PSA.38.1	Nor on me lay thy chast'ning hand,
PSA.38.1	in thy displeasure hot.
PSA.38.2	For in me fast thine arrows stick,
PSA.38.2	thine hand doth press me sore:
PSA.38.3	And in my flesh there is no health,
PSA.38.3	nor soundness any more.
PSA.38.3	This grief I have, because thy wrath
PSA.38.3	is forth against me gone;
PSA.38.3	And in my bones there is no rest,
PSA.38.3	for sin that I have done.
PSA.38.4	Because gone up above mine head
PSA.38.4	my great transgressions be;
PSA.38.4	And, as a weighty burden, they
PSA.38.4	too heavy are for me.
PSA.38.5	My wounds do stink, and are corrupt;
PSA.38.5	my folly makes it so.
PSA.38.6	I troubled am, and much bow'd down;
PSA.38.6	all day I mourning go.
PSA.38.7	For a disease that loathsome is
PSA.38.7	so fills my loins with pain,
PSA.38.7	That in my weak and weary flesh
PSA.38.7	no soundness doth remain.
PSA.38.8	So feeble and infirm am I,
PSA.38.8	and broken am so sore,
PSA.38.8	That, through disquiet of my heart,
PSA.38.8	I have been made to roar.
PSA.38.9	O Lord, all that I do desire
PSA.38.9	is still before thine eye;
PSA.38.9	And of my heart the secret groans
PSA.38.9	not hidden are from thee.
PSA.38.10	My heart doth pant incessantly,
PSA.38.10	my strength doth quite decay;
PSA.38.10	As for mine eyes, their wonted light
PSA.38.10	is from me gone away.
PSA.38.11	My lovers and my friends do stand
PSA.38.11	at distance from my sore;
PSA.38.11	And those do stand aloof that were
PSA.38.11	kinsmen and kind before.
PSA.38.12	Yea, they that seek my life lay snares:
PSA.38.12	who seek to do me wrong
PSA.38.12	Speak things mischievous, and deceits
PSA.38.12	imagine all day long.
PSA.38.13	But, as one deaf, that heareth not,
PSA.38.13	I suffer'd all to pass;
PSA.38.13	I as a dumb man did become,
PSA.38.13	whose mouth not open'd was:
PSA.38.14	As one that hears not, in whose mouth
PSA.38.14	are no reproofs at all.
PSA.38.15	For, Lord, I hope in thee; my God,
PSA.38.15	thou'lt hear me when I call.
PSA.38.16	For I said, Hear me, lest they should
PSA.38.16	rejoice o'er me with pride;
PSA.38.16	And o'er me magnify themselves,
PSA.38.16	when as my foot doth slide.
PSA.38.17	For I am near to halt, my grief
PSA.38.17	is still before mine eye:
PSA.38.18	For I'll declare my sin, and grieve
PSA.38.18	for mine iniquity.
PSA.38.19	But yet mine en'mies lively are,
PSA.38.19	and strong are they beside;
PSA.38.19	And they that hate me wrongfully
PSA.38.19	are greatly multiply'd.
PSA.38.20	And they for good that render ill,
PSA.38.20	as en'mies me withstood;
PSA.38.20	Yea, ev'n for this, because that I
PSA.38.20	do follow what is good.
PSA.38.21	Forsake me not, O Lord; my God,
PSA.38.21	far from me never be.
PSA.38.22	O Lord, thou my salvation art,
PSA.38.22	haste to give help to me.
PSA.39.1	I said, I will look to my ways,
PSA.39.1	lest with my tongue I sin:
PSA.39.1	In sight of wicked men my mouth
PSA.39.1	with bridle I'll keep in.
PSA.39.2	With silence I as dumb became,
PSA.39.2	I did myself restrain
PSA.39.2	From speaking good; but then the more
PSA.39.2	increased was my pain.
PSA.39.3	My heart within me waxed hot;
PSA.39.3	and, while I musing was,
PSA.39.3	The fire did burn; and from my tongue
PSA.39.3	these words I did let pass:
PSA.39.4	Mine end, and measure of my days,
PSA.39.4	O Lord, unto me show
PSA.39.4	What is the same; that I thereby
PSA.39.4	my frailty well may know.
PSA.39.5	Lo, thou my days an handbreadth mad'st;
PSA.39.5	mine age is in thine eye
PSA.39.5	As nothing: sure each man at best
PSA.39.5	is wholly vanity.
PSA.39.6	Sure each man walks in a vain show;
PSA.39.6	they vex themselves in vain:
PSA.39.6	He heaps up wealth, and doth not know
PSA.39.6	to whom it shall pertain.
PSA.39.7	And now, O Lord, what wait I for?
PSA.39.7	my hope is fix'd on thee.
PSA.39.8	Free me from all my trespasses,
PSA.39.8	the fool's scorn make not me.
PSA.39.9	Dumb was I, op'ning not my mouth,
PSA.39.9	because this work was thine.
PSA.39.10	Thy stroke take from me; by the blow
PSA.39.10	of thine hand I do pine.
PSA.39.11	When with rebukes thou dost correct
PSA.39.11	man for iniquity,
PSA.39.11	Thou wastes his beauty like a moth:
PSA.39.11	sure each man's vanity.
PSA.39.12	Attend my cry, Lord, at my tears
PSA.39.12	and pray'rs not silent be:
PSA.39.12	I sojourn as my fathers all,
PSA.39.12	and stranger am with thee.
PSA.39.13	O spare thou me, that I my strength
PSA.39.13	recover may again,
PSA.39.13	Before from hence I do depart,
PSA.39.13	and here no more remain.
PSA.40.1	I waited for the Lord my God,
PSA.40.1	and patiently did bear;
PSA.40.1	At length to me he did incline
PSA.40.1	my voice and cry to hear.
PSA.40.2	He took me from a fearful pit,
PSA.40.2	and from the miry clay,
PSA.40.2	And on a rock he set my feet,
PSA.40.2	establishing my way.
PSA.40.3	He put a new song in my mouth,
PSA.40.3	our God to magnify:
PSA.40.3	Many shall see it, and shall fear,
PSA.40.3	and on the Lord rely.
PSA.40.4	O blessed is the man whose trust
PSA.40.4	upon the Lord relies;
PSA.40.4	Respecting not the proud, nor such
PSA.40.4	as turn aside to lies.
PSA.40.5	O Lord my God, full many are
PSA.40.5	the wonders thou hast done;
PSA.40.5	Thy gracious thoughts to us-ward far
PSA.40.5	above all thoughts are gone:
PSA.40.5	In order none can reckon them
PSA.40.5	to thee: if them declare,
PSA.40.5	And speak of them I would, they more
PSA.40.5	than can be number'd are.
PSA.40.6	No sacrifice nor offering
PSA.40.6	didst thou at all desire;
PSA.40.6	Mine ears thou bor'd: sin-off 'ring thou
PSA.40.6	and burnt didst not require:
PSA.40.7	Then to the Lord these were my words,
PSA.40.7	I come, behold and see;
PSA.40.7	Within the volume of the book
PSA.40.7	it written is of me:
PSA.40.8	To do thy will I take delight,
PSA.40.8	O thou my God that art;
PSA.40.8	Yea, that most holy law of thine
PSA.40.8	I have within my heart.
PSA.40.9	Within the congregation great
PSA.40.9	I righteousness did preach:
PSA.40.9	Lo, thou dost know, O Lord, that I
PSA.40.9	refrained not my speech.
PSA.40.10	I never did within my heart
PSA.40.10	conceal thy righteousness;
PSA.40.10	I thy salvation have declar'd,
PSA.40.10	and shown thy faithfulness:
PSA.40.10	Thy kindness, which most loving is,
PSA.40.10	concealed have not I,
PSA.40.10	Nor from the congregation great
PSA.40.10	have hid thy verity.
PSA.40.11	Thy tender mercies, Lord, from me
PSA.40.11	O do thou not restrain;
PSA.40.11	Thy loving-kindness, and thy truth,
PSA.40.11	let them me still maintain.
PSA.40.12	For ills past reck'ning compass me,
PSA.40.12	and mine iniquities
PSA.40.12	Such hold upon me taken have,
PSA.40.12	I cannot lift mine eyes:
PSA.40.12	They more than hairs are on mine head,
PSA.40.12	thence is my heart dismay'd.
PSA.40.13	Be pleased, Lord, to rescue me;
PSA.40.13	Lord, hasten to mine aid.
PSA.40.14	Sham'd and confounded be they all
PSA.40.14	that seek my soul to kill;
PSA.40.14	Yea, let them backward driven be,
PSA.40.14	and sham'd, that wish me ill.
PSA.40.15	For a reward of this their shame
PSA.40.15	confounded let them be.
PSA.40.15	That in this manner scoffing say,
PSA.40.15	Aha, aha! to me.
PSA.40.16	In thee let all be glad, and joy,
PSA.40.16	who seeking thee abide;
PSA.40.16	Who thy salvation love, say still,
PSA.40.16	The Lord be magnify'd.
PSA.40.17	I'm poor and needy, yet the Lord
PSA.40.17	of me a care doth take:
PSA.40.17	Thou art my help and saviour,
PSA.40.17	my God, no tarrying make.
PSA.41.1	Blessed is he that wisely doth
PSA.41.1	the poor man's case consider;
PSA.41.1	For when the time of trouble is,
PSA.41.1	the Lord will him deliver.
PSA.41.2	God will him keep, yea, save alive;
PSA.41.2	on earth he bless'd shall live;
PSA.41.2	And to his enemies' desire
PSA.41.2	thou wilt him not up give.
PSA.41.3	God will give strength when he on bed
PSA.41.3	of languishing doth mourn;
PSA.41.3	And in his sickness sore, O Lord,
PSA.41.3	thou all his bed wilt turn.
PSA.41.4	I said, O Lord, do thou extend
PSA.41.4	thy mercy unto me;
PSA.41.4	O do thou heal my soul; for why?
PSA.41.4	I have offended thee.
PSA.41.5	Those that to me are enemies,
PSA.41.5	of me do evil say,
PSA.41.5	When shall he die, that so his name
PSA.41.5	may perish quite away?
PSA.41.6	To see me if he comes, he speaks
PSA.41.6	vain words: but then his heart
PSA.41.6	Heaps mischief to it, which he tells,
PSA.41.6	when forth he doth depart.
PSA.41.7	My haters jointly whispering,
PSA.41.7	'gainst me my hurt devise.
PSA.41.8	Mischief, say they, cleaves fast to him;
PSA.41.8	he li'th, and shall not rise.
PSA.41.9	Yea, ev'n mine own familiar friend,
PSA.41.9	on whom I did rely,
PSA.41.9	Who ate my bread, ev'n he his heel
PSA.41.9	against me lifted high.
PSA.41.10	But, Lord, be merciful to me,
PSA.41.10	and up again me raise,
PSA.41.10	That I may justly them requite
PSA.41.10	according to their ways.
PSA.41.11	By this I know that certainly
PSA.41.11	I favour'd am by thee;
PSA.41.11	Because my hateful enemy
PSA.41.11	triumphs not over me.
PSA.41.12	But as for me, thou me uphold'st
PSA.41.12	in mine integrity;
PSA.41.12	And me before thy countenance
PSA.41.12	thou sett'st continually.
PSA.41.13	The Lord, the God of Israel,
PSA.41.13	be bless'd for ever then,
PSA.41.13	From age to age eternally.
PSA.41.13	Amen, yea, and amen.
PSA.42.1	Like as the hart for water-brooks
PSA.42.1	in thirst doth pant and bray;
PSA.42.1	So pants my longing soul, O God,
PSA.42.1	that come to thee I may.
PSA.42.2	My soul for God, the living God,
PSA.42.2	doth thirst: when shall I near
PSA.42.2	Unto thy countenance approach,
PSA.42.2	and in God's sight appear?
PSA.42.3	My tears have unto me been meat,
PSA.42.3	both in the night and day,
PSA.42.3	While unto me continually,
PSA.42.3	Where is thy God? they say.
PSA.42.4	My soul is poured out in me,
PSA.42.4	when this I think upon;
PSA.42.4	Because that with the multitude
PSA.42.4	I heretofore had gone:
PSA.42.4	With them into God's house I went,
PSA.42.4	with voice of joy and praise;
PSA.42.4	Yea, with the multitude that kept
PSA.42.4	the solemn holy days.
PSA.42.5	O why art thou cast down, my soul?
PSA.42.5	why in me so dismay'd?
PSA.42.5	Trust God, for I shall praise him yet,
PSA.42.5	his count'nance is mine aid.
PSA.42.6	My God, my soul's cast down in me;
PSA.42.6	thee therefore mind I will
PSA.42.6	From Jordan's land, the Hermonites,
PSA.42.6	and ev'n from Mizar hill.
PSA.42.7	At the noise of thy water-spouts
PSA.42.7	deep unto deep doth call;
PSA.42.7	Thy breaking waves pass over me,
PSA.42.7	yea, and thy billows all.
PSA.42.8	His loving-kindness yet the Lord
PSA.42.8	command will in the day,
PSA.42.8	His song's with me by night; to God,
PSA.42.8	by whom I live, I'll pray:
PSA.42.9	And I will say to God my rock,
PSA.42.9	Why me forgett'st thou so?
PSA.42.9	Why, for my foes' oppression,
PSA.42.9	thus mourning do I go?
PSA.42.10	'Tis as a sword within my bones,
PSA.42.10	when my foes me upbraid;
PSA.42.10	Ev'n when by them, Where is thy God?
PSA.42.10	'tis daily to me said.
PSA.42.11	O why art thou cast down, my soul?
PSA.42.11	why, thus with grief opprest,
PSA.42.11	Art thou disquieted in me?
PSA.42.11	in God still hope and rest:
PSA.42.11	For yet I know I shall him praise,
PSA.42.11	who graciously to me
PSA.42.11	The health is of my countenance,
PSA.42.11	yea, mine own God is he.
PSA.43.1	Judge me, O God, and plead my cause
PSA.43.1	against th' ungodly nation;
PSA.43.1	From the unjust and crafty man,
PSA.43.1	O be thou my salvation.
PSA.43.2	For thou the God art of my strength;
PSA.43.2	why thrusts thou me thee fro'?
PSA.43.2	For th' enemy's oppression
PSA.43.2	why do I mourning go?
PSA.43.3	O send thy light forth and thy truth;
PSA.43.3	let them be guides to me,
PSA.43.3	And bring me to thine holy hill,
PSA.43.3	ev'n where thy dwellings be.
PSA.43.4	Then will I to God's altar go,
PSA.43.4	to God my chiefest joy:
PSA.43.4	Yea, God, my God, thy name to praise
PSA.43.4	my harp I will employ.
PSA.43.5	Why art thou then cast down, my soul?
PSA.43.5	what should discourage thee?
PSA.43.5	And why with vexing thoughts art thou
PSA.43.5	disquieted in me?
PSA.43.5	Still trust in God; for him to praise
PSA.43.5	good cause I yet shall have:
PSA.43.5	He of my count'nance is the health,
PSA.43.5	my God that doth me save.
PSA.44.1	O God, we with our ears have heard,
PSA.44.1	our fathers have us told,
PSA.44.1	What works thou in their days hadst done,
PSA.44.1	ev'n in the days of old.
PSA.44.2	Thy hand did drive the heathen out,
PSA.44.2	and plant them in their place;
PSA.44.2	Thou didst afflict the nations,
PSA.44.2	but them thou didst increase.
PSA.44.3	For neither got their sword the land,
PSA.44.3	nor did their arm them save;
PSA.44.3	But thy right hand, arm, countenance;
PSA.44.3	for thou them favour gave.
PSA.44.4	Thou art my King: for Jacob, Lord,
PSA.44.4	deliv'rances command.
PSA.44.5	Through thee we shall push down our foes,
PSA.44.5	that do against us stand:
PSA.44.5	We, through thy name, shall tread down those
PSA.44.5	that ris'n against us have.
PSA.44.6	For in my bow I shall not trust,
PSA.44.6	nor shall my sword me save.
PSA.44.7	But from our foes thou hast us sav'd,
PSA.44.7	our haters put to shame.
PSA.44.8	In God we all the day do boast,
PSA.44.8	and ever praise thy name.
PSA.44.9	But now we are cast off by thee,
PSA.44.9	and us thou putt'st to shame;
PSA.44.9	And when our armies do go forth,
PSA.44.9	thou go'st not with the same.
PSA.44.10	Thou mak'st us from the enemy,
PSA.44.10	faint-hearted, to turn back;
PSA.44.10	And they who hate us for themselves
PSA.44.10	our spoils away do take.
PSA.44.11	Like sheep for meat thou gavest us;
PSA.44.11	'mong heathen cast we be.
PSA.44.12	Thou didst for nought thy people sell;
PSA.44.12	their price enrich'd not thee.
PSA.44.13	Thou mak'st us a reproach to be
PSA.44.13	unto our neighbours near;
PSA.44.13	Derision and a scorn to them
PSA.44.13	that round about us are.
PSA.44.14	A by-word also thou dost us
PSA.44.14	among the heathen make;
PSA.44.14	The people, in contempt and spite,
PSA.44.14	at us their heads do shake.
PSA.44.15	Before me my confusion
PSA.44.15	continually abides;
PSA.44.15	And of my bashful countenance
PSA.44.15	the shame me ever hides:
PSA.44.16	For voice of him that doth reproach,
PSA.44.16	and speaketh blasphemy;
PSA.44.16	By reason of th' avenging foe,
PSA.44.16	and cruel enemy.
PSA.44.17	All this is come on us, yet we
PSA.44.17	have not forgotten thee;
PSA.44.17	Nor falsely in thy covenant
PSA.44.17	behav'd ourselves have we.
PSA.44.18	Back from thy way our heart not turn'd;
PSA.44.18	our steps no straying made;
PSA.44.19	Though us thou brak'st in dragons' place,
PSA.44.19	and cover'dst with death's shade.
PSA.44.20	If we God's name forgot, or stretch'd
PSA.44.20	to a strange god our hands,
PSA.44.21	Shall not God search this out? for he
PSA.44.21	heart's secrets understands.
PSA.44.22	Yea, for thy sake we're kill'd all day,
PSA.44.22	counted as slaughter-sheep.
PSA.44.23	Rise, Lord, cast us not ever off;
PSA.44.23	awake, why dost thou sleep?
PSA.44.24	O wherefore hidest thou thy face?
PSA.44.24	forgett'st our cause distress'd,
PSA.44.25	And our oppression? For our soul
PSA.44.25	is to the dust down press'd:
PSA.44.25	Our belly also on the earth
PSA.44.25	fast cleaving, hold doth take.
PSA.44.26	Rise for our help, and us redeem,
PSA.44.26	ev'n for thy mercies' sake.
PSA.45.1	My heart brings forth a goodly thing;
PSA.45.1	my words that I indite
PSA.45.1	Concern the King: my tongue's a pen
PSA.45.1	of one that swift doth write.
PSA.45.2	Thou fairer art than sons of men:
PSA.45.2	into thy lips is store
PSA.45.2	Of grace infus'd; God therefore thee
PSA.45.2	hath bless'd for evermore.
PSA.45.3	O thou that art the mighty One,
PSA.45.3	thy sword gird on thy thigh;
PSA.45.3	Ev'n with thy glory excellent,
PSA.45.3	and with thy majesty.
PSA.45.4	For meekness, truth, and righteousness,
PSA.45.4	in state ride prosp'rously;
PSA.45.4	And thy right hand shall thee instruct
PSA.45.4	in things that fearful be.
PSA.45.5	Thine arrows sharply pierce the heart
PSA.45.5	of th' en'mies of the King;
PSA.45.5	And under thy subjection
PSA.45.5	the people down do bring.
PSA.45.6	For ever and for ever is,
PSA.45.6	O God, thy throne of might;
PSA.45.6	The sceptre of thy kingdom is
PSA.45.6	a sceptre that is right.
PSA.45.7	Thou lovest right, and hatest ill;
PSA.45.7	for God, thy God, most high,
PSA.45.7	Above thy fellows hath with th' oil
PSA.45.7	of joy anointed thee.
PSA.45.8	Of aloes, myrrh,
PSA.45.8	and cassia, a smell thy garments had,
PSA.45.8	Out of the iv'ry palaces,
PSA.45.8	whereby they made thee glad.
PSA.45.9	Among thy women honourable
PSA.45.9	kings' daughters were at hand:
PSA.45.9	Upon thy right hand did the queen
PSA.45.9	in gold of Ophir stand.
PSA.45.10	O daughter, hearken and regard,
PSA.45.10	and do thine ear incline;
PSA.45.10	Likewise forget thy father's house,
PSA.45.10	and people that are thine.
PSA.45.11	Then of the King desir'd shall be
PSA.45.11	thy beauty veh'mently:
PSA.45.11	Because he is thy Lord, do thou
PSA.45.11	him worship rev'rently.
PSA.45.12	The daughter there of Tyre shall be
PSA.45.12	with gifts and off 'rings great:
PSA.45.12	Those of the people that are rich
PSA.45.12	thy favour shall entreat.
PSA.45.13	Behold, the daughter of the King
PSA.45.13	all glorious is within;
PSA.45.13	And with embroideries of gold
PSA.45.13	her garments wrought have been.
PSA.45.14	She shall be brought unto the King
PSA.45.14	in robes with needle wrought;
PSA.45.14	Her fellow-virgins following
PSA.45.14	shall unto thee be brought.
PSA.45.15	They shall be brought with gladness great,
PSA.45.15	and mirth on ev'ry side,
PSA.45.15	Into the palace of the King,
PSA.45.15	and there they shall abide.
PSA.45.16	Instead of those thy fathers dear,
PSA.45.16	thy children thou may'st take,
PSA.45.16	And in all places of the earth
PSA.45.16	them noble princes make.
PSA.45.17	Thy name remember'd I will make
PSA.45.17	through ages all to be:
PSA.45.17	The people therefore evermore
PSA.45.17	shall praises give to thee.
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and our strength,
PSA.46.1	in straits a present aid;
PSA.46.2	Therefore, although the earth remove,
PSA.46.2	we will not be afraid:
PSA.46.2	Though hills amidst the seas be cast;
PSA.46.3	Though waters roaring make,
PSA.46.3	And troubled be; yea, though the hills,
PSA.46.3	by swelling seas do shake.
PSA.46.4	A river is, whose streams do glad
PSA.46.4	the city of our God;
PSA.46.4	The holy place, wherein the Lord
PSA.46.4	most high hath his abode.
PSA.46.5	God in the midst of her doth dwell;
PSA.46.5	nothing shall her remove:
PSA.46.5	The Lord to her an helper will,
PSA.46.5	and that right early, prove.
PSA.46.6	The heathen rag'd tumultuously,
PSA.46.6	the kingdoms moved were:
PSA.46.6	The Lord God uttered his voice,
PSA.46.6	the earth did melt for fear.
PSA.46.7	The Lord of hosts upon our side
PSA.46.7	doth constantly remain:
PSA.46.7	The God of Jacob's our refuge,
PSA.46.7	us safely to maintain.
PSA.46.8	Come, and behold what wondrous works
PSA.46.8	have by the Lord been wrought;
PSA.46.8	Come, see what desolations
PSA.46.8	he on the earth hath brought.
PSA.46.9	Unto the ends of all the earth
PSA.46.9	wars into peace he turns:
PSA.46.9	The bow he breaks, the spear he cuts,
PSA.46.9	in fire the chariot burns.
PSA.46.10	Be still, and know that I am God;
PSA.46.10	among the heathen I
PSA.46.10	Will be exalted; I on earth
PSA.46.10	will be exalted high.
PSA.46.11	Our God, who is the Lord of hosts,
PSA.46.11	is still upon our side;
PSA.46.11	The God of Jacob our refuge
PSA.46.11	for ever will abide.
PSA.47.1	All people, clap your hands; to God
PSA.47.1	with voice of triumph shout:
PSA.47.2	For dreadful is the Lord most high,
PSA.47.2	great King the earth throughout.
PSA.47.3	The heathen people under us
PSA.47.3	he surely shall subdue;
PSA.47.3	And he shall make the nations
PSA.47.3	under our feet to bow.
PSA.47.4	The lot of our inheritance
PSA.47.4	chuse out for us shall he,
PSA.47.4	Of Jacob, whom he loved well,
PSA.47.4	ev'n the excellency.
PSA.47.5	God is with shouts gone up, the Lord
PSA.47.5	with trumpets sounding high.
PSA.47.6	Sing praise to God, sing praise, sing praise,
PSA.47.6	praise to our King sing ye.
PSA.47.7	For God is King of all the earth;
PSA.47.7	with knowledge praise express.
PSA.47.8	God rules the nations: God sits on
PSA.47.8	his throne of holiness.
PSA.47.9	The princes of the people are
PSA.47.9	assembled willingly;
PSA.47.9	Ev'n of the God of Abraham
PSA.47.9	they who the people be.
PSA.47.9	For why? the shields that do defend
PSA.47.9	the earth are only his:
PSA.47.9	They to the Lord belong; yea, he
PSA.47.9	exalted greatly is.
PSA.48.1	Great is the Lord, and greatly he
PSA.48.1	is to be praised still,
PSA.48.1	Within the city of our God,
PSA.48.1	upon his holy hill.
PSA.48.2	Mount Sion stands most beautiful,
PSA.48.2	the joy of all the land;
PSA.48.2	The city of the mighty King
PSA.48.2	on her north side doth stand.
PSA.48.3	The Lord within her palaces
PSA.48.3	is for a refuge known.
PSA.48.4	For, lo, the kings that gather'd were
PSA.48.4	together, by have gone.
PSA.48.5	But when they did behold the same,
PSA.48.5	they, wond'ring, would not stay;
PSA.48.5	But, being troubled at the sight,
PSA.48.5	they thence did haste away.
PSA.48.6	Great terror there took hold on them;
PSA.48.6	they were possess'd with fear;
PSA.48.6	Their grief came like a woman's pain,
PSA.48.6	when she a child doth bear.
PSA.48.7	Thou Tarshish ships with east wind break'st:
PSA.48.8	As we have heard it told,
PSA.48.8	So, in the city of the Lord,
PSA.48.8	our eyes did it behold;
PSA.48.8	In our God's city, which his hand
PSA.48.8	for ever stablish will.
PSA.48.9	We of thy loving-kindness thought,
PSA.48.9	Lord, in thy temple still.
PSA.48.10	O Lord, according to thy name,
PSA.48.10	through all the earth's thy praise;
PSA.48.10	And thy right hand, O Lord, is full
PSA.48.10	of righteousness always.
PSA.48.11	Because thy judgments are made known,
PSA.48.11	let Sion mount rejoice;
PSA.48.11	Of Judah let the daughters all
PSA.48.11	send forth a cheerful voice.
PSA.48.12	Walk about Sion,
PSA.48.12	and go round; the high tow'rs thereof tell:
PSA.48.13	Consider ye her palaces,
PSA.48.13	and mark her bulwarks well;
PSA.48.13	That ye may tell posterity.
PSA.48.14	For this God doth abide
PSA.48.14	Our God for evermore; he will
PSA.48.14	ev'n unto death us guide.
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all people, and give ear,
PSA.49.1	all in the world that dwell;
PSA.49.2	Both low and high, both rich and poor.
PSA.49.3	My mouth shall wisdom tell:
PSA.49.3	My heart shall knowledge meditate.
PSA.49.4	I will incline mine ear
PSA.49.4	To parables, and on the harp
PSA.49.4	my sayings dark declare.
PSA.49.5	Amidst those days that evil be,
PSA.49.5	why should I, fearing, doubt?
PSA.49.5	When of my heels th' iniquity
PSA.49.5	shall compass me about.
PSA.49.6	Whoe'er they be that in their wealth
PSA.49.6	their confidence do pitch,
PSA.49.6	And boast themselves, because they are
PSA.49.6	become exceeding rich:
PSA.49.7	Yet none of these his brother can
PSA.49.7	redeem by any way;
PSA.49.7	Nor can he unto God for him
PSA.49.7	sufficient ransom pay,
PSA.49.8	(Their soul's redemption precious is,
PSA.49.8	and it can never be,)
PSA.49.9	That still he should for ever live,
PSA.49.9	and not corruption see.
PSA.49.10	For why? he seeth that wise men die,
PSA.49.10	and brutish fools also
PSA.49.10	Do perish; and their wealth, when dead,
PSA.49.10	to others they let go.
PSA.49.11	Their inward thought is, that their house
PSA.49.11	and dwelling-places shall
PSA.49.11	Stand through all ages; they their lands
PSA.49.11	by their own names do call.
PSA.49.12	But yet in honour shall not man
PSA.49.12	abide continually;
PSA.49.12	But passing hence, may be compar'd
PSA.49.12	unto the beasts that die.
PSA.49.13	Thus brutish folly plainly is
PSA.49.13	their wisdom and their way;
PSA.49.13	Yet their posterity approve
PSA.49.13	what they do fondly say.
PSA.49.14	Like sheep they in the grave are laid,
PSA.49.14	and death shall them devour;
PSA.49.14	And in the morning upright men
PSA.49.14	shall over them have pow'r:
PSA.49.14	Their beauty from their dwelling shall
PSA.49.14	consume within the grave.
PSA.49.15	But from hell's hand God will me free,
PSA.49.15	for he shall me receive.
PSA.49.16	Be thou not then afraid when one
PSA.49.16	enriched thou dost see,
PSA.49.16	Nor when the glory of his house
PSA.49.16	advanced is on high:
PSA.49.17	For he shall carry nothing hence
PSA.49.17	when death his days doth end;
PSA.49.17	Nor shall his glory after him
PSA.49.17	into the grave descend.
PSA.49.18	Although he his own soul did bless
PSA.49.18	whilst he on earth did live;
PSA.49.18	(And when thou to thyself dost well,
PSA.49.18	men will thee praises give;)
PSA.49.19	He to his fathers' race shall go,
PSA.49.19	they never shall see light.
PSA.49.20	Man honour'd wanting knowledge is
PSA.49.20	like beasts that perish quite.
PSA.50.1	The mighty God, the Lord,
PSA.50.1	hath spoken, and did call
PSA.50.1	The earth, from rising of the sun,
PSA.50.1	to where he hath his fall.
PSA.50.2	From out of Sion hill,
PSA.50.2	which of excellency
PSA.50.2	And beauty the perfection is,
PSA.50.2	God shined gloriously.
PSA.50.3	Our God shall surely come,
PSA.50.3	keep silence shall not he:
PSA.50.3	Before him fire shall waste, great storms
PSA.50.3	shall round about him be.
PSA.50.4	Unto the heavens clear
PSA.50.4	he from above shall call,
PSA.50.4	And to the earth likewise, that he
PSA.50.4	may judge his people all.
PSA.50.5	Together let my saints
PSA.50.5	unto me gather'd be,
PSA.50.5	Those that by sacrifice have made
PSA.50.5	a covenant with me.
PSA.50.6	And then the heavens shall
PSA.50.6	his righteousness declare:
PSA.50.6	Because the Lord himself is he
PSA.50.6	by whom men judged are.
PSA.50.7	My people Isr'el hear,
PSA.50.7	speak will I from on high,
PSA.50.7	Against thee I will testify;
PSA.50.7	God, ev'n thy God, am I.
PSA.50.8	I for thy sacrifice
PSA.50.8	no blame will on thee lay,
PSA.50.8	Nor for burnt-off 'rings, which to me
PSA.50.8	thou offer'dst ev'ry day.
PSA.50.9	I'll take no calf nor goats
PSA.50.9	from house or fold of thine:
PSA.50.10	For beasts of forests, cattle all
PSA.50.10	on thousand hills, are mine.
PSA.50.11	The fowls on mountains high
PSA.50.11	are all to me well known;
PSA.50.11	Wild beasts which in the fields do lie,
PSA.50.11	ev'n they are all mine own.
PSA.50.12	Then, if I hungry were,
PSA.50.12	I would not tell it thee;
PSA.50.12	Because the world, and fulness all
PSA.50.12	thereof, belongs to me.
PSA.50.13	Will I eat flesh of bulls?
PSA.50.13	or goats' blood drink will I?
PSA.50.14	Thanks offer thou to God, and pay
PSA.50.14	thy vows to the most High.
PSA.50.15	And call upon me when
PSA.50.15	in trouble thou shalt be;
PSA.50.15	I will deliver thee, and thou
PSA.50.15	my name shalt glorify.
PSA.50.16	But to the wicked man
PSA.50.16	God saith, My laws and truth
PSA.50.16	Should'st thou declare? how dar'st thou take
PSA.50.16	my cov'nant in thy mouth?
PSA.50.17	Sith thou instruction hat'st,
PSA.50.17	which should thy ways direct;
PSA.50.17	And sith my words behind thy back
PSA.50.17	thou cast'st, and dost reject.
PSA.50.18	When thou a thief didst see,
PSA.50.18	with him thou didst consent;
PSA.50.18	And with the vile adulterers
PSA.50.18	partaker on thou went.
PSA.50.19	Thou giv'st thy mouth to ill,
PSA.50.19	thy tongue deceit doth frame;
PSA.50.20	Thou sitt'st, and 'gainst thy brother speak'st,
PSA.50.20	thy mother's son dost shame.
PSA.50.21	Because I silence kept,
PSA.50.21	while thou these things hast wrought;
PSA.50.21	That I was altogether like
PSA.50.21	thyself, hath been thy thought;
PSA.50.21	Yet I will thee reprove,
PSA.50.21	and set before thine eyes,
PSA.50.21	In order ranked, thy misdeeds
PSA.50.21	and thine iniquities.
PSA.50.22	Now, ye that God forget,
PSA.50.22	this carefully consider;
PSA.50.22	Lest I in pieces tear you all,
PSA.50.22	and none can you deliver.
PSA.50.23	Whoso doth offer praise
PSA.50.23	me glorifies; and I
PSA.50.23	Will shew him God's salvation,
PSA.50.23	that orders right his way.
PSA.51.1	After thy loving-kindness, Lord,
PSA.51.1	have mercy upon me:
PSA.51.1	For thy compassions great, blot out
PSA.51.1	all mine iniquity.
PSA.51.2	Me cleanse from sin, and throughly wash
PSA.51.2	from mine iniquity:
PSA.51.3	For my transgressions I confess;
PSA.51.3	my sin I ever see.
PSA.51.4	'Gainst thee, thee only, have I sinn'd,
PSA.51.4	in thy sight done this ill;
PSA.51.4	That when thou speak'st thou may'st be just,
PSA.51.4	and clear in judging still.
PSA.51.5	Behold, I in iniquity
PSA.51.5	was form'd the womb within;
PSA.51.5	My mother also me conceiv'd
PSA.51.5	in guiltiness and sin.
PSA.51.6	Behold, thou in the inward parts
PSA.51.6	with truth delighted art;
PSA.51.6	And wisdom thou shalt make me know
PSA.51.6	within the hidden part.
PSA.51.7	Do thou with hyssop sprinkle me,
PSA.51.7	I shall be cleansed so;
PSA.51.7	Yea, wash thou me, and then I shall
PSA.51.7	be whiter than the snow.
PSA.51.8	Of gladness and of joyfulness
PSA.51.8	make me to hear the voice;
PSA.51.8	That so these very bones which thou
PSA.51.8	hast broken may rejoice.
PSA.51.9	All mine iniquities blot out,
PSA.51.9	thy face hide from my sin.
PSA.51.10	Create a clean heart, Lord, renew
PSA.51.10	a right sp'rit me within.
PSA.51.11	Cast me not from thy sight, nor take
PSA.51.11	thy Holy Sp'rit away.
PSA.51.12	Restore me thy salvation's joy;
PSA.51.12	with thy free Sp'rit me stay.
PSA.51.13	Then will I teach thy ways unto
PSA.51.13	those that transgressors be;
PSA.51.13	And those that sinners are shall then
PSA.51.13	be turned unto thee.
PSA.51.14	O God, of my salvation God,
PSA.51.14	me from blood-guiltiness
PSA.51.14	Set free; then shall my tongue aloud
PSA.51.14	sing of thy righteousness.
PSA.51.15	My closed lips, O Lord, by thee
PSA.51.15	let them be opened;
PSA.51.15	Then shall thy praises by my mouth
PSA.51.15	abroad be published.
PSA.51.16	For thou desir'st not sacrifice,
PSA.51.16	else would I give it thee;
PSA.51.16	Nor wilt thou with burnt-offering
PSA.51.16	at all delighted be.
PSA.51.17	A broken spirit is to God
PSA.51.17	a pleasing sacrifice:
PSA.51.17	A broken and a contrite heart,
PSA.51.17	Lord, thou wilt not despise.
PSA.51.18	Shew kindness, and do good, O Lord,
PSA.51.18	to Sion, thine own hill:
PSA.51.18	The walls of thy Jerusalem
PSA.51.18	build up of thy good will.
PSA.51.19	Then righteous off 'rings shall thee please,
PSA.51.19	and off 'rings burnt, which they
PSA.51.19	With whole burnt-off 'rings,
PSA.51.19	and with calves, shall on thine altar lay.
PSA.52.1	Why dost thou boast, O mighty man,
PSA.52.1	of mischief and of ill?
PSA.52.1	The goodness of Almighty God
PSA.52.1	endureth ever still.
PSA.52.2	Thy tongue mischievous calumnies
PSA.52.2	deviseth subtilely,
PSA.52.2	Like to a razor sharp to cut,
PSA.52.2	working deceitfully.
PSA.52.3	Ill more than good, and more than truth
PSA.52.3	thou lovest to speak wrong:
PSA.52.4	Thou lovest all-devouring words,
PSA.52.4	O thou deceitful tongue.
PSA.52.5	So God shall thee destroy for aye,
PSA.52.5	remove thee, pluck thee out
PSA.52.5	Quite from thy house, out of the land
PSA.52.5	of life he shall thee root.
PSA.52.6	The righteous shall it see, and fear,
PSA.52.6	and laugh at him they shall:
PSA.52.7	Lo, this the man is that did not
PSA.52.7	make God his strength at all:
PSA.52.7	But he in his abundant wealth
PSA.52.7	his confidence did place;
PSA.52.7	And he took strength unto himself
PSA.52.7	from his own wickedness.
PSA.52.8	But I am in the house of God
PSA.52.8	like to an olive green:
PSA.52.8	My confidence for ever hath
PSA.52.8	upon God's mercy been.
PSA.52.9	And I for ever will thee praise,
PSA.52.9	because thou hast done this:
PSA.52.9	I on thy name will wait; for good
PSA.52.9	before thy saints it is.
PSA.53.1	That there is not a God, the fool
PSA.53.1	doth in his heart conclude:
PSA.53.1	They are corrupt, their works are vile,
PSA.53.1	not one of them doth good.
PSA.53.2	The Lord upon the sons of men
PSA.53.2	from heav'n did cast his eyes,
PSA.53.2	To see if any one there was
PSA.53.2	that sought God, and was wise.
PSA.53.3	They altogether filthy are,
PSA.53.3	they all are backward gone;
PSA.53.3	And there is none that doeth good,
PSA.53.3	no, not so much as one.
PSA.53.4	These workers of iniquity,
PSA.53.4	do they not know at all,
PSA.53.4	That they my people eat as bread,
PSA.53.4	and on God do not call?
PSA.53.5	Ev'n there they were afraid, and stood
PSA.53.5	with trembling, all dismay'd,
PSA.53.5	Whereas there was no cause at all
PSA.53.5	why they should be afraid:
PSA.53.5	For God his bones that thee besieg'd
PSA.53.5	hath scatter'd all abroad;
PSA.53.5	Thou hast confounded them, for they
PSA.53.5	despised are of God.
PSA.53.6	Let Isr'el's help from Sion come:
PSA.53.6	when back the Lord shall bring
PSA.53.6	His captives, Jacob shall rejoice,
PSA.53.6	and Israel shall sing.
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God, by thy great name,
PSA.54.1	and judge me by thy strength:
PSA.54.2	My prayer hear, O God; give ear
PSA.54.2	unto my words at length.
PSA.54.3	For they that strangers are to me
PSA.54.3	do up against me rise;
PSA.54.3	Oppressors seek my soul, and God
PSA.54.3	set not before their eyes.
PSA.54.4	The Lord my God my helper is,
PSA.54.4	lo, therefore I am bold:
PSA.54.4	He taketh part with ev'ry one
PSA.54.4	that doth my soul uphold.
PSA.54.5	Unto mine enemies he shall
PSA.54.5	mischief and ill repay:
PSA.54.5	O for thy truth's sake cut them off,
PSA.54.5	and sweep them clean away.
PSA.54.6	I will a sacrifice to thee
PSA.54.6	give with free willingness;
PSA.54.6	Thy name, O Lord, because 'tis good,
PSA.54.6	with praise I will confess.
PSA.54.7	For he hath me delivered
PSA.54.7	from all adversities;
PSA.54.7	And his desire mine eye hath seen
PSA.54.7	upon mine enemies.
PSA.55.1	Lord, hear my pray'r, hide not thyself
PSA.55.1	from my entreating voice:
PSA.55.2	Attend and hear me; in my plaint
PSA.55.2	I mourn and make a noise.
PSA.55.3	Because of th' en'my's voice, and for
PSA.55.3	lewd men's oppression great:
PSA.55.3	On me they cast iniquity,
PSA.55.3	and they in wrath me hate.
PSA.55.4	Sore pain'd within me is my heart:
PSA.55.4	death's terrors on me fall.
PSA.55.5	On me comes trembling, fear and dread
PSA.55.5	o'erwhelmed me withal.
PSA.55.6	O that I, like a dove, had wings,
PSA.55.6	said I, then would I flee
PSA.55.6	Far hence, that I might find a place
PSA.55.6	where I in rest might be.
PSA.55.7	Lo, then far off I wander would,
PSA.55.7	and in the desert stay;
PSA.55.8	From windy storm and tempest I
PSA.55.8	would haste to 'scape away.
PSA.55.9	O Lord, on them destruction bring,
PSA.55.9	and do their tongues divide;
PSA.55.9	For in the city violence and strife I have espy'd.
PSA.55.10	They day and night upon the walls
PSA.55.10	do go about it round:
PSA.55.10	There mischief is, and sorrow there
PSA.55.10	in midst of it is found.
PSA.55.11	Abundant wickedness there is
PSA.55.11	within her inward part;
PSA.55.11	And from her streets deceitfulness
PSA.55.11	and guile do not depart.
PSA.55.12	He was no foe that me reproach'd,
PSA.55.12	then that endure I could;
PSA.55.12	Nor hater that did 'gainst me boast,
PSA.55.12	from him me hide I would.
PSA.55.13	But thou, man, who mine equal, guide,
PSA.55.13	and mine acquaintance wast:
PSA.55.14	We join'd sweet counsels, to God's house
PSA.55.14	in company we past.
PSA.55.15	Let death upon them seize, and down
PSA.55.15	let them go quick to hell;
PSA.55.15	For wickedness doth much abound
PSA.55.15	among them where they dwell.
PSA.55.16	I'll call on God: God will me save.
PSA.55.17	I'll pray, and make a noise
PSA.55.17	At ev'ning, morning, and at noon;
PSA.55.17	and he shall hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He hath my soul delivered,
PSA.55.18	that it in peace might be
PSA.55.18	From battle that against me was;
PSA.55.18	for many were with me.
PSA.55.19	The Lord shall hear, and them afflict,
PSA.55.19	of old who hath abode:
PSA.55.19	Because they never changes have,
PSA.55.19	therefore they fear not God.
PSA.55.20	'Gainst those that were at peace with him
PSA.55.20	he hath put forth his hand:
PSA.55.20	The covenant that he had made,
PSA.55.20	by breaking he profan'd.
PSA.55.21	More smooth than butter were his words,
PSA.55.21	while in his heart was war;
PSA.55.21	His speeches were more soft than oil,
PSA.55.21	and yet drawn swords they are.
PSA.55.22	Cast thou thy burden on the Lord,
PSA.55.22	and he shall thee sustain;
PSA.55.22	Yea, he shall cause the righteous man
PSA.55.22	unmoved to remain.
PSA.55.23	But thou, O Lord my God, those men
PSA.55.23	in justice shalt o'erthrow,
PSA.55.23	And in destruction's dungeon dark
PSA.55.23	at last shalt lay them low:
PSA.55.23	The bloody and deceitful men
PSA.55.23	shall not live half their days:
PSA.55.23	But upon thee with confidence
PSA.55.23	I will depend always.
PSA.56.1	Shew mercy, Lord, to me, for man
PSA.56.1	would swallow me outright;
PSA.56.1	He me oppresseth, while he doth
PSA.56.1	against me daily fight.
PSA.56.2	They daily would me swallow up
PSA.56.2	that hate me spitefully;
PSA.56.2	For they be many that do fight
PSA.56.2	against me, O most High.
PSA.56.3	When I'm afraid I'll trust in thee:
PSA.56.4	In God I'll praise his word;
PSA.56.4	I will not fear what flesh can do,
PSA.56.4	my trust is in the Lord.
PSA.56.5	Each day they wrest my words; their thoughts
PSA.56.5	'gainst me are all for ill.
PSA.56.6	They meet, they lurk, they mark my steps,
PSA.56.6	waiting my soul to kill.
PSA.56.7	But shall they by iniquity
PSA.56.7	escape thy judgments so?
PSA.56.7	O God, with indignation down
PSA.56.7	do thou the people throw.
PSA.56.8	My wand'rings all what they have been
PSA.56.8	thou know'st, their number took;
PSA.56.8	Into thy bottle put my tears:
PSA.56.8	are they not in thy book?
PSA.56.9	My foes shall, when I cry, turn back;
PSA.56.9	I know't, God is for me.
PSA.56.10	In God his word I'll praise; his word
PSA.56.10	in God shall praised be.
PSA.56.11	In God I trust; I will not fear
PSA.56.11	what man can do to me.
PSA.56.12	Thy vows upon me are, O God:
PSA.56.12	I'll render praise to thee.
PSA.56.13	Wilt thou not, who from death me sav'd,
PSA.56.13	my feet from falls keep free,
PSA.56.13	To walk before God in the light
PSA.56.13	of those that living be?
PSA.57.1	Be merciful to me, O God;
PSA.57.1	thy mercy unto me
PSA.57.1	Do thou extend; because my soul
PSA.57.1	doth put her trust in thee:
PSA.57.1	Yea, in the shadow of thy wings
PSA.57.1	my refuge I will place,
PSA.57.1	Until these sad calamities
PSA.57.1	do wholly overpass.
PSA.57.2	My cry I will cause to ascend
PSA.57.2	unto the Lord most high;
PSA.57.2	To God, who doth all things for me
PSA.57.2	perform most perfectly.
PSA.57.3	From heav'n he shall send down, and me
PSA.57.3	from his reproach defend
PSA.57.3	That would devour me: God his truth
PSA.57.3	and mercy forth shall send.
PSA.57.4	My soul among fierce lions is,
PSA.57.4	I firebrands live among,
PSA.57.4	Men's sons, whose teeth are spears and darts,
PSA.57.4	a sharp sword is their tongue.
PSA.57.5	Be thou exalted very high
PSA.57.5	above the heav'ns, O God;
PSA.57.5	Let thou thy glory be advanc'd
PSA.57.5	o'er all the earth abroad.
PSA.57.6	My soul's bow'd down; for they a net
PSA.57.6	have laid, my steps to snare:
PSA.57.6	Into the pit which they have digg'd
PSA.57.6	for me, they fallen are.
PSA.57.7	My heart is fix'd, my heart is fix'd,
PSA.57.7	O God; I'll sing and praise.
PSA.57.8	My glory wake; wake psalt'ry, harp;
PSA.57.8	myself I'll early raise.
PSA.57.9	I'll praise thee 'mong the people, Lord;
PSA.57.9	'mong nations sing will I:
PSA.57.10	For great to heav'n thy mercy is,
PSA.57.10	thy truth is to the sky.
PSA.57.11	O Lord, exalted be thy name
PSA.57.11	above the heav'ns to stand:
PSA.57.11	Do thou thy glory far advance
PSA.57.11	above both sea and land.
PSA.58.1	Do ye, O congregation,
PSA.58.1	indeed speak righteousness?
PSA.58.1	O ye that are the sons of men,
PSA.58.1	judge ye with uprightness?
PSA.58.2	Yea, ev'n within your very hearts
PSA.58.2	ye wickedness have done;
PSA.58.2	And ye the vi'lence of your hands
PSA.58.2	do weigh the earth upon.
PSA.58.3	The wicked men estranged are,
PSA.58.3	ev'n from the very womb;
PSA.58.3	They, speaking lies, do stray as soon
PSA.58.3	as to the world they come.
PSA.58.4	Unto a serpent's poison like
PSA.58.4	their poison doth appear;
PSA.58.4	Yea, they are like the adder deaf,
PSA.58.4	that closely stops her ear;
PSA.58.5	That so she may not hear the voice
PSA.58.5	of one that charm her would,
PSA.58.5	No, not though he most cunning were,
PSA.58.5	and charm most wisely could.
PSA.58.6	Their teeth, O God, within their mouth
PSA.58.6	break thou in pieces small;
PSA.58.6	The great teeth break thou out, O Lord,
PSA.58.6	of these young lions all.
PSA.58.7	Let them like waters melt away,
PSA.58.7	which downward still do flow:
PSA.58.7	In pieces cut his arrows all,
PSA.58.7	when he shall bend his bow.
PSA.58.8	Like to a snail that melts away,
PSA.58.8	let each of them be gone;
PSA.58.8	Like woman's birth untimely, that
PSA.58.8	they never see the sun.
PSA.58.9	He shall them take away before
PSA.58.9	your pots the thorns can find,
PSA.58.9	Both living, and in fury great,
PSA.58.9	as with a stormy wind.
PSA.58.10	The righteous, when he vengeance sees,
PSA.58.10	he shall be joyful then;
PSA.58.10	The righteous one shall wash his feet
PSA.58.10	in blood of wicked men.
PSA.58.11	So men shall say,
PSA.58.11	The righteous man
PSA.58.11	reward shall never miss:
PSA.58.11	And verily upon the earth
PSA.58.11	a God to judge there is.
PSA.59.1	My God, deliver me from those
PSA.59.1	that are mine enemies;
PSA.59.1	And do thou me defend from those
PSA.59.1	that up against me rise.
PSA.59.2	Do thou deliver me from them
PSA.59.2	that work iniquity;
PSA.59.2	And give me safety from the men
PSA.59.2	of bloody cruelty.
PSA.59.3	For, lo, they for my soul lay wait:
PSA.59.3	the mighty do combine
PSA.59.3	Against me, Lord; not for my fault,
PSA.59.3	nor any sin of mine.
PSA.59.4	They run, and, without fault in me,
PSA.59.4	themselves do ready make:
PSA.59.4	Awake to meet me with thy help;
PSA.59.4	and do thou notice take.
PSA.59.5	Awake therefore, Lord God of hosts,
PSA.59.5	thou God of Israel,
PSA.59.5	To visit heathen all: spare none
PSA.59.5	that wickedly rebel.
PSA.59.6	At ev'ning they go to and fro;
PSA.59.6	they make great noise and sound,
PSA.59.6	Like to a dog, and often walk
PSA.59.6	about the city round.
PSA.59.7	Behold, they belch out with their mouth,
PSA.59.7	and in their lips are swords:
PSA.59.7	For they do say thus, Who is he
PSA.59.7	that now doth hear our words?
PSA.59.8	But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them,
PSA.59.8	and all the heathen mock.
PSA.59.9	While he's in pow'r I'll wait on thee;
PSA.59.9	for God is my high rock.
PSA.59.10	He of my mercy that is God
PSA.59.10	betimes shall me prevent;
PSA.59.10	Upon mine en'mies God shall let
PSA.59.10	me see mine heart's content.
PSA.59.11	Them slay not, lest my folk forget;
PSA.59.11	but scatter them abroad
PSA.59.11	By thy strong pow'r; and bring them down,
PSA.59.11	O thou our shield and God.
PSA.59.12	For their mouth's sin, and for the words
PSA.59.12	that from their lips do fly,
PSA.59.12	Let them be taken in their pride;
PSA.59.12	because they curse and lie.
PSA.59.13	In wrath consume them, them consume,
PSA.59.13	that so they may not be:
PSA.59.13	And that in Jacob God doth rule
PSA.59.13	to th' earth's ends let them see.
PSA.59.14	At ev'ning let thou them return,
PSA.59.14	making great noise and sound,
PSA.59.14	Like to a dog, and often walk
PSA.59.14	about the city round.
PSA.59.15	And let them wander up and down,
PSA.59.15	in seeking food to eat;
PSA.59.15	And let them grudge when they shall not
PSA.59.15	be satisfy'd with meat.
PSA.59.16	But of thy pow'r I'll sing aloud;
PSA.59.16	at morn thy mercy praise:
PSA.59.16	For thou to me my refuge wast,
PSA.59.16	and tow'r, in troublous days.
PSA.59.17	O God, thou art my strength, I will
PSA.59.17	sing praises unto thee;
PSA.59.17	For God is my defence, a God
PSA.59.17	of mercy unto me.
PSA.60.1	O Lord, thou hast rejected us,
PSA.60.1	and scatter'd us abroad;
PSA.60.1	Thou justly hast displeased been;
PSA.60.1	return to us,
PSA.60.2	The earth to tremble thou hast made;
PSA.60.2	therein didst breaches make:
PSA.60.2	Do thou thereof the breaches heal,
PSA.60.2	because the land doth shake.
PSA.60.3	Unto thy people thou hard things hast shew'd,
PSA.60.3	and on them sent;
PSA.60.3	And thou hast caused us to drink
PSA.60.3	wine of astonishment.
PSA.60.4	And yet a banner thou hast giv'n
PSA.60.4	to them who thee do fear;
PSA.60.4	That it by them, because of truth,
PSA.60.4	displayed may appear.
PSA.60.5	That thy beloved people may
PSA.60.5	deliver'd be from thrall,
PSA.60.5	Save with the pow'r of thy right hand,
PSA.60.5	and hear me when I call.
PSA.60.6	God in his holiness hath spoke;
PSA.60.6	herein I will take pleasure:
PSA.60.6	Shechem I will divide, and forth
PSA.60.6	will Succoth's valley measure.
PSA.60.7	Gilead I claim as mine by right;
PSA.60.7	Manasseh mine shall be;
PSA.60.7	Ephraim is of mine head the strength;
PSA.60.7	Judah gives laws for me;
PSA.60.8	Moab's my washing-pot; my shoe
PSA.60.8	I'll over Edom throw;
PSA.60.8	And over Palestina's land
PSA.60.8	I will in triumph go.
PSA.60.9	O who is he will bring me to
PSA.60.9	the city fortify'd?
PSA.60.9	O who is he that to the land
PSA.60.9	of Edom will me guide?
PSA.60.10	O God, which hadest us cast off,
PSA.60.10	this thing wilt thou not do?
PSA.60.10	Ev'n thou, O God, which didest not
PSA.60.10	forth with our armies go?
PSA.60.11	Help us from trouble; for the help
PSA.60.11	is vain which man supplies.
PSA.60.12	Through God we'll do great acts; he shall
PSA.60.12	tread down our enemies.
PSA.61.1	O God, give ear unto my cry;
PSA.61.1	unto my pray'r attend.
PSA.61.2	From th' utmost corner of the land
PSA.61.2	my cry to thee I'll send.
PSA.61.2	What time my heart is overwhelm'd,
PSA.61.2	and in perplexity,
PSA.61.2	Do thou me lead unto the Rock
PSA.61.2	that higher is than I.
PSA.61.3	For thou hast for my refuge been
PSA.61.3	a shelter by thy pow'r;
PSA.61.3	And for defence against my foes
PSA.61.3	thou hast been a strong tow'r.
PSA.61.4	Within thy tabernacle I
PSA.61.4	for ever will abide;
PSA.61.4	And under covert of thy wings
PSA.61.4	with confidence me hide.
PSA.61.5	For thou the vows that I did make,
PSA.61.5	O Lord my God, didst hear:
PSA.61.5	Thou hast giv'n me the heritage
PSA.61.5	of those thy name that fear.
PSA.61.6	A life prolong'd for many days
PSA.61.6	thou to the king shalt give;
PSA.61.6	Like many generations be
PSA.61.6	the years which he shall live.
PSA.61.7	He in God's presence his abode
PSA.61.7	for evermore shall have:
PSA.61.7	O do thou truth and mercy both
PSA.61.7	prepare, that may him save.
PSA.61.8	And so will I perpetually
PSA.61.8	sing praise unto thy name;
PSA.61.8	That having made my vows, I may
PSA.61.8	each day perform the same.
PSA.62.1	My soul with expectation
PSA.62.1	depends on God indeed;
PSA.62.1	My strength and my salvation doth
PSA.62.1	from him alone proceed.
PSA.62.2	He only my salvation is,
PSA.62.2	and my strong rock is he:
PSA.62.2	He only is my sure defence;
PSA.62.2	much mov'd I shall not be.
PSA.62.3	How long will ye against a man
PSA.62.3	plot mischief? ye shall all
PSA.62.3	Be slain; ye as a tott'ring fence shall be,
PSA.62.3	and bowing wall.
PSA.62.4	They only plot to cast him down
PSA.62.4	from his excellency:
PSA.62.4	They joy in lies; with mouth they bless,
PSA.62.4	but they curse inwardly.
PSA.62.5	My soul, wait thou with patience
PSA.62.5	upon thy God alone;
PSA.62.5	On him dependeth all my hope
PSA.62.5	and expectation.
PSA.62.6	He only my salvation is,
PSA.62.6	and my strong rock is he;
PSA.62.6	He only is my sure defence:
PSA.62.6	I shall not moved be.
PSA.62.7	In God my glory placed is,
PSA.62.7	and my salvation sure;
PSA.62.7	In God the rock is of my strength,
PSA.62.7	my refuge most secure.
PSA.62.8	Ye people, place your confidence
PSA.62.8	in him continually;
PSA.62.8	Before him pour ye out your heart:
PSA.62.8	God is our refuge high.
PSA.62.9	Surely mean men are vanity,
PSA.62.9	and great men are a lie;
PSA.62.9	In balance laid, they wholly are
PSA.62.9	more light than vanity.
PSA.62.10	Trust ye not in oppression,
PSA.62.10	in robb'ry be not vain;
PSA.62.10	On wealth set not your hearts, when as
PSA.62.10	increased is your gain.
PSA.62.11	God hath it spoken once to me,
PSA.62.11	yea, this I heard again,
PSA.62.11	That power to Almighty God
PSA.62.11	alone doth appertain.
PSA.62.12	Yea, mercy also unto thee
PSA.62.12	belongs, O Lord, alone:
PSA.62.12	For thou according to his work
PSA.62.12	rewardest ev'ry one.
PSA.63.1	Lord, thee my God, I'll early seek:
PSA.63.1	my soul doth thirst for thee;
PSA.63.1	My flesh longs in a dry parch'd land,
PSA.63.1	wherein no waters be:
PSA.63.2	That I thy power may behold,
PSA.63.2	and brightness of thy face,
PSA.63.2	As I have seen thee heretofore
PSA.63.2	within thy holy place.
PSA.63.3	Since better is thy love than life,
PSA.63.3	my lips thee praise shall give.
PSA.63.4	I in thy name will lift my hands,
PSA.63.4	and bless thee while I live.
PSA.63.5	Ev'n as with marrow and with fat
PSA.63.5	my soul shall filled be;
PSA.63.5	Then shall my mouth with joyful lips
PSA.63.5	sing praises unto thee:
PSA.63.6	When I do thee upon my bed
PSA.63.6	remember with delight,
PSA.63.6	And when on thee I meditate
PSA.63.6	in watches of the night.
PSA.63.7	In shadow of thy wings I'll joy;
PSA.63.7	for thou mine help hast been.
PSA.63.8	My soul thee follows hard; and me
PSA.63.8	thy right hand doth sustain.
PSA.63.9	Who seek my soul to spill shall sink
PSA.63.9	down to earth's lowest room.
PSA.63.10	They by the sword shall be cut off,
PSA.63.10	and foxes' prey become.
PSA.63.11	Yet shall the king in God rejoice,
PSA.63.11	and each one glory shall
PSA.63.11	That swear by him: but stopp'd shall be
PSA.63.11	the mouth of liars all.
PSA.64.1	When I to thee my prayer make,
PSA.64.1	Lord, to my voice give ear;
PSA.64.1	My life save from the enemy,
PSA.64.1	of whom I stand in fear.
PSA.64.2	Me from their secret counsel hide
PSA.64.2	who do live wickedly;
PSA.64.2	From insurrection of those men
PSA.64.2	that work iniquity:
PSA.64.3	Who do their tongues with malice whet,
PSA.64.3	and make them cut like swords;
PSA.64.3	In whose bent bows are arrows set,
PSA.64.3	ev'n sharp and bitter words:
PSA.64.4	That they may at the perfect man
PSA.64.4	in secret aim their shot;
PSA.64.4	Yea, suddenly they dare at him to shoot,
PSA.64.4	and fear it not.
PSA.64.5	In ill encourage they themselves,
PSA.64.5	and their snares close do lay:
PSA.64.5	Together conference they have;
PSA.64.5	Who shall them see? they say.
PSA.64.6	They have search'd out iniquities,
PSA.64.6	a perfect search they keep:
PSA.64.6	Of each of them the inward thought,
PSA.64.6	and very heart, is deep.
PSA.64.7	God shall an arrow shoot at them,
PSA.64.7	and wound them suddenly:
PSA.64.8	So their own tongue shall them confound;
PSA.64.8	all who them see shall fly.
PSA.64.9	And on all men a fear shall fall,
PSA.64.9	God's works they shall declare;
PSA.64.9	For they shall wisely notice take
PSA.64.9	what these his doings are.
PSA.64.10	In God the righteous shall rejoice,
PSA.64.10	and trust upon his might;
PSA.64.10	Yea, they shall greatly glory all
PSA.64.10	in heart that are upright.
PSA.65.1	Praise waits for thee in Sion, Lord:
PSA.65.1	to thee vows paid shall be.
PSA.65.2	O thou that hearer art of pray'r,
PSA.65.2	all flesh shall come to thee.
PSA.65.3	Iniquities, I must confess,
PSA.65.3	prevail against me do:
PSA.65.3	But as for our transgressions,
PSA.65.3	them purge away shalt thou.
PSA.65.4	Bless'd is the man whom thou dost chuse,
PSA.65.4	and mak'st approach to thee,
PSA.65.4	That he within thy courts, O Lord,
PSA.65.4	may still a dweller be:
PSA.65.4	We surely shall be satisfy'd
PSA.65.4	with thy abundant grace,
PSA.65.4	And with the goodness of thy house,
PSA.65.4	ev'n of thy holy place.
PSA.65.5	O God of our salvation,
PSA.65.5	thou, in thy righteousness,
PSA.65.5	By fearful works unto our pray'rs
PSA.65.5	thine answer dost express:
PSA.65.5	Therefore the ends of all the earth,
PSA.65.5	and those afar that be
PSA.65.5	Upon the sea, their confidence,
PSA.65.5	O Lord, will place in thee.
PSA.65.6	Who, being girt with pow'r, sets fast
PSA.65.6	by his great strength the hills.
PSA.65.7	Who noise of seas, noise of their waves,
PSA.65.7	and people's tumult, stills.
PSA.65.8	Those in the utmost parts that dwell
PSA.65.8	are at thy signs afraid:
PSA.65.8	Th' outgoings of the morn and ev'n
PSA.65.8	by thee are joyful made.
PSA.65.9	The earth thou visit'st, wat'ring it;
PSA.65.9	thou mak'st it rich to grow
PSA.65.9	With God's full flood; thou corn prepar'st,
PSA.65.9	when thou provid'st it so.
PSA.65.10	Her rigs thou wat'rest plenteously,
PSA.65.10	her furrows settelest:
PSA.65.10	With show'rs thou dost her mollify,
PSA.65.10	her spring by thee is blest.
PSA.65.11	So thou the year most lib'rally
PSA.65.11	dost with thy goodness crown;
PSA.65.11	And all thy paths abundantly
PSA.65.11	on us drop fatness down.
PSA.65.12	They drop upon the pastures wide,
PSA.65.12	that do in deserts lie;
PSA.65.12	The little hills on ev'ry side
PSA.65.12	rejoice right pleasantly.
PSA.65.13	With flocks the pastures clothed be,
PSA.65.13	the vales with corn are clad;
PSA.65.13	And now they shout and sing to thee,
PSA.65.13	for thou hast made them glad.
PSA.66.1	All lands to God in joyful sounds,
PSA.66.1	aloft your voices raise.
PSA.66.2	Sing forth the honour of his name,
PSA.66.2	and glorious make his praise.
PSA.66.3	Say unto God, How terrible
PSA.66.3	in all thy works art thou!
PSA.66.3	Through thy great pow'r thy foes to thee
PSA.66.3	shall be constrain'd to bow.
PSA.66.4	All on the earth shall worship thee,
PSA.66.4	they shall thy praise proclaim
PSA.66.4	In songs: they shall sing cheerfully
PSA.66.4	unto thy holy name.
PSA.66.5	Come, and the works that God hath wrought
PSA.66.5	with admiration see:
PSA.66.5	In's working to the sons of men
PSA.66.5	most terrible is he.
PSA.66.6	Into dry land the sea he turn'd,
PSA.66.6	and they a passage had;
PSA.66.6	Ev'n marching through the flood on foot,
PSA.66.6	there we in him were glad.
PSA.66.7	He ruleth ever by his pow'r;
PSA.66.7	his eyes the nations see:
PSA.66.7	O let not the rebellious ones
PSA.66.7	lift up themselves on high.
PSA.66.8	Ye people, bless our God; aloud
PSA.66.8	the voice speak of his praise:
PSA.66.9	Our soul in life who safe preserves,
PSA.66.9	our foot from sliding stays.
PSA.66.10	For thou didst prove and try us, Lord,
PSA.66.10	as men do silver try;
PSA.66.11	Brought'st us into the net,
PSA.66.11	and mad'st bands on our loins to lie.
PSA.66.12	Thou hast caus'd men ride o'er our heads;
PSA.66.12	and though that we did pass
PSA.66.12	Through fire and water, yet thou brought'st
PSA.66.12	us to a wealthy place.
PSA.66.13	I'll bring burnt off 'rings to thy house;
PSA.66.13	to thee my vows I'll pay,
PSA.66.14	Which my lips utter'd, my mouth spake,
PSA.66.14	when trouble on me lay.
PSA.66.15	Burnt-sacrifices of fat rams
PSA.66.15	with incense I will bring;
PSA.66.15	Of bullocks and of goats I will
PSA.66.15	present an offering.
PSA.66.16	All that fear God, come, hear, I'll tell
PSA.66.16	what he did for my soul.
PSA.66.17	I with my mouth unto him cry'd,
PSA.66.17	my tongue did him extol.
PSA.66.18	If in my heart I sin regard,
PSA.66.18	the Lord me will not hear:
PSA.66.19	But surely God me heard,
PSA.66.19	and to my prayer's voice gave ear.
PSA.66.20	O let the Lord, our gracious God,
PSA.66.20	for ever blessed be,
PSA.66.20	Who turned not my pray'r from him,
PSA.66.20	nor yet his grace from me.
PSA.67.1	Lord, bless and pity us,
PSA.67.1	shine on us with thy face:
PSA.67.2	That th' earth thy way, and nations all
PSA.67.2	may know thy saving grace.
PSA.67.3	Let people praise thee, Lord;
PSA.67.3	let people all thee praise.
PSA.67.4	O let the nations be glad,
PSA.67.4	in songs their voices raise:
PSA.67.4	Thou'lt justly people judge,
PSA.67.4	on earth rule nations all.
PSA.67.5	Let people praise thee, Lord; let them
PSA.67.5	praise thee, both great and small.
PSA.67.6	The earth her fruit shall yield,
PSA.67.6	our God shall blessing send.
PSA.67.7	God shall us bless; men shall him fear
PSA.67.7	unto earth's utmost end.
PSA.68.1	Let God arise, and scatterèd
PSA.68.1	let all his en'mies be;
PSA.68.1	And let all those that do him hate
PSA.68.1	before his presence flee.
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driv'n, so drive thou them;
PSA.68.2	as fire melts wax away,
PSA.68.2	Before God's face let wicked men
PSA.68.2	so perish and decay.
PSA.68.3	But let the righteous be glad:
PSA.68.3	let them before God's sight
PSA.68.3	Be very joyful; yea, let them
PSA.68.3	rejoice with all their might.
PSA.68.4	To God sing, to his name sing praise;
PSA.68.4	extol him with your voice,
PSA.68.4	That rides on heav'n, by his name Jah,
PSA.68.4	before his face rejoice.
PSA.68.5	Because the Lord a father is
PSA.68.5	unto the fatherless;
PSA.68.5	God is the widow's judge, within
PSA.68.5	his place of holiness.
PSA.68.6	God doth the solitary set
PSA.68.6	in fam'lies: and from bands
PSA.68.6	The chain'd doth free; but rebels do
PSA.68.6	inhabit parched lands.
PSA.68.7	O God, what time thou didst go forth
PSA.68.7	before thy people's face;
PSA.68.7	And when through the great wilderness
PSA.68.7	thy glorious marching was;
PSA.68.8	Then at God's presence shook the earth,
PSA.68.8	then drops from heaven fell;
PSA.68.8	This Sinai shook before the Lord,
PSA.68.8	the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	O God, thou to thine heritage
PSA.68.9	didst send a plenteous rain,
PSA.68.9	Whereby thou, when it weary was,
PSA.68.9	didst it refresh again.
PSA.68.10	Thy congregation then did make
PSA.68.10	their habitation there:
PSA.68.10	Of thine own goodness for the poor,
PSA.68.10	O God, thou didst prepare.
PSA.68.11	The Lord himself did give the word,
PSA.68.11	the word abroad did spread;
PSA.68.11	Great was the company of them
PSA.68.11	the same who published.
PSA.68.12	Kings of great armies foiled were,
PSA.68.12	and forced to flee away;
PSA.68.12	And women, who remained at home,
PSA.68.12	did distribute the prey.
PSA.68.13	Though ye have lien among the pots,
PSA.68.13	like doves ye shall appear,
PSA.68.13	Whose wings with silver, and with gold
PSA.68.13	whose feathers covered are.
PSA.68.14	When there th' Almighty scatter'd kings,
PSA.68.14	like Salmon's snow 'twas white.
PSA.68.15	God's hill is like to Bashan hill,
PSA.68.15	like Bashan hill for height.
PSA.68.16	Why do ye leap, ye mountains high?
PSA.68.16	this is the hill where God
PSA.68.16	Desires to dwell; yea, God in it
PSA.68.16	for aye will make abode.
PSA.68.17	God's chariots twenty thousand are,
PSA.68.17	thousands of angels strong;
PSA.68.17	In's holy place God is, as in
PSA.68.17	mount Sinai, them among.
PSA.68.18	Thou hast, O Lord, most glorious,
PSA.68.18	ascended up on high;
PSA.68.18	And in triumph victorious led
PSA.68.18	captive captivity:
PSA.68.18	Thou hast received gifts for men,
PSA.68.18	for such as did rebel;
PSA.68.18	Yea, ev'n for them, that God the Lord
PSA.68.18	in midst of them might dwell.
PSA.68.19	Blessed be the Lord, who is to us
PSA.68.19	of our salvation God;
PSA.68.19	Who daily with his benefits
PSA.68.19	us plenteously doth load.
PSA.68.20	He of salvation is the God,
PSA.68.20	who is our God most strong;
PSA.68.20	And unto God the Lord from death
PSA.68.20	the issues do belong.
PSA.68.21	But surely God shall wound the head
PSA.68.21	of those that are his foes;
PSA.68.21	The hairy scalp of him that still
PSA.68.21	on in his trespass goes.
PSA.68.22	God said, My people I will bring
PSA.68.22	again from Bashan hill;
PSA.68.22	Yea, from the sea's devouring depths
PSA.68.22	them bring again I will;
PSA.68.23	That in the blood of enemies
PSA.68.23	thy foot imbrued may be,
PSA.68.23	And of thy dogs dipped in the same
PSA.68.23	the tongues thou mayest see.
PSA.68.24	Thy goings they have seen, O God;
PSA.68.24	the steps of majesty
PSA.68.24	Of my God, and my mighty King,
PSA.68.24	within the sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	Before went singers, players next
PSA.68.25	on instruments took way;
PSA.68.25	And them among the damsels were
PSA.68.25	that did on timbrels play.
PSA.68.26	Within the congregations
PSA.68.26	bless God with one accord:
PSA.68.26	From Isr'el's fountain do ye bless
PSA.68.26	and praise the mighty Lord.
PSA.68.27	With their prince, little Benjamin,
PSA.68.27	princes and council there
PSA.68.27	Of Judah were, there Zabulon's
PSA.68.27	and Napht'li's princes were.
PSA.68.28	Thy God commands thy strength; make strong
PSA.68.28	what thou wrought'st for us, Lord.
PSA.68.29	For thy house at Jerusalem
PSA.68.29	kings shall thee gifts afford.
PSA.68.30	The spearmen's host, the multitude
PSA.68.30	of bulls, which fiercely look,
PSA.68.30	Those calves which people have forth sent,
PSA.68.30	O Lord our God, rebuke,
PSA.68.30	Till ev'ry one submit himself,
PSA.68.30	and silver pieces bring:
PSA.68.30	The people that delight in war
PSA.68.30	disperse, O God and King.
PSA.68.31	Those that be princes great shall then
PSA.68.31	come out of Egypt lands;
PSA.68.31	And Ethiopia to God
PSA.68.31	shall soon stretch out her hands.
PSA.68.32	O all ye kingdoms of the earth,
PSA.68.32	sing praises to this King;
PSA.68.32	For he is Lord that ruleth all,
PSA.68.32	unto him praises sing.
PSA.68.33	To him that rides on heav'ns of heav'ns,
PSA.68.33	which he of old did found;
PSA.68.33	Lo, he sends out his voice, a voice
PSA.68.33	in might that doth abound.
PSA.68.34	Strength unto God do ye ascribe;
PSA.68.34	for his excellency
PSA.68.34	Is over Israel, his strength
PSA.68.34	is in the clouds most high.
PSA.68.35	Thou'rt from thy temple dreadful, Lord;
PSA.68.35	Isr'el's own God is he,
PSA.68.35	Who gives his people strength and pow'r:
PSA.68.35	O let God blessed be.
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God, because the floods
PSA.69.1	do so environ me,
PSA.69.1	That ev'n unto my very soul
PSA.69.1	come in the waters be.
PSA.69.2	I downward in deep mire do sink,
PSA.69.2	where standing there is none:
PSA.69.2	I am into deep waters come,
PSA.69.2	where floods have o'er me gone.
PSA.69.3	I weary with my crying am,
PSA.69.3	my throat is also dry'd;
PSA.69.3	Mine eyes do fail, while for my God
PSA.69.3	I waiting do abide.
PSA.69.4	Those men that do without a cause
PSA.69.4	bear hatred unto me,
PSA.69.4	Than are the hairs upon my head
PSA.69.4	in number more they be:
PSA.69.4	They that would me destroy, and are
PSA.69.4	mine en'mies wrongfully,
PSA.69.4	Are mighty: so what I took not,
PSA.69.4	to render forc'd was I.
PSA.69.5	Lord, thou my folly know'st, my sins
PSA.69.5	not cover'd are from thee.
PSA.69.6	Let none that wait on thee be sham'd,
PSA.69.6	Lord God of hosts, for me.
PSA.69.6	O Lord, the God of Israel,
PSA.69.6	let none, who search do make,
PSA.69.6	And seek thee, be at any time
PSA.69.6	confounded for my sake.
PSA.69.7	For I have borne reproach for thee,
PSA.69.7	my face is hid with shame.
PSA.69.8	To brethren strange, to mother's sons
PSA.69.8	an alien I became.
PSA.69.9	Because the zeal did eat me up,
PSA.69.9	which to thine house I bear;
PSA.69.9	And the reproaches cast at thee,
PSA.69.9	upon me fallen are.
PSA.69.10	My tears and fasts, t' afflict my soul,
PSA.69.10	were turned to my shame.
PSA.69.11	When sackcloth I did wear, to them
PSA.69.11	a proverb I became.
PSA.69.12	The men that in the gate do sit
PSA.69.12	against me evil spake;
PSA.69.12	They also that vile drunkards were
PSA.69.12	of me their song did make.
PSA.69.13	But, in an acceptable time,
PSA.69.13	my pray'r, Lord, is to thee:
PSA.69.13	In truth of thy salvation, Lord,
PSA.69.13	and mercy great, hear me.
PSA.69.14	Deliver me out of the mire,
PSA.69.14	from sinking do me keep;
PSA.69.14	Free me from those that do me hate,
PSA.69.14	and from the waters deep.
PSA.69.15	Let not the flood on me prevail,
PSA.69.15	whose water overflows;
PSA.69.15	Nor deep me swallow, nor the pit
PSA.69.15	her mouth upon me close.
PSA.69.16	Hear me, O Lord, because thy love
PSA.69.16	and kindness is most good;
PSA.69.16	Turn unto me, according to
PSA.69.16	thy mercies' multitude.
PSA.69.17	Nor from thy servant hide thy face:
PSA.69.17	I'm troubled, soon attend.
PSA.69.18	Draw near my soul, and it redeem;
PSA.69.18	me from my foes defend.
PSA.69.19	To thee is my reproach well known,
PSA.69.19	my shame, and my disgrace:
PSA.69.19	Those that mine adversaries be
PSA.69.19	are all before thy face.
PSA.69.20	Reproach hath broke my heart; I'm full
PSA.69.20	of grief: I look'd for one
PSA.69.20	To pity me, but none I found;
PSA.69.20	comforters found I none.
PSA.69.21	They also bitter gall did give
PSA.69.21	unto me for my meat:
PSA.69.21	They gave me vinegar to drink,
PSA.69.21	when as my thirst was great.
PSA.69.22	Before them let their table prove
PSA.69.22	a snare; and do thou make
PSA.69.22	Their welfare and prosperity
PSA.69.22	a trap themselves to take.
PSA.69.23	Let thou their eyes so darken'd be,
PSA.69.23	that sight may them forsake;
PSA.69.23	And let their loins be made by thee
PSA.69.23	continually to shake.
PSA.69.24	Thy fury pour thou out on them,
PSA.69.24	and indignation;
PSA.69.24	And let thy wrathful anger, Lord,
PSA.69.24	fast hold take them upon.
PSA.69.25	All waste and desolate let be
PSA.69.25	their habitation;
PSA.69.25	And in their tabernacles all
PSA.69.25	inhabitants be none.
PSA.69.26	Because him they do persecute,
PSA.69.26	whom thou didst smite before;
PSA.69.26	They talk unto the grief of those
PSA.69.26	whom thou hast wounded sore.
PSA.69.27	Add thou iniquity unto
PSA.69.27	their former wickedness;
PSA.69.27	And do not let them come at all
PSA.69.27	into thy righteousness.
PSA.69.28	Out of the book of life let them
PSA.69.28	be raz'd and blotted quite;
PSA.69.28	Among the just and righteous
PSA.69.28	let not their names be writ.
PSA.69.29	But now become exceeding poor
PSA.69.29	and sorrowful am I:
PSA.69.29	By thy salvation, O my God,
PSA.69.29	let me be set on high.
PSA.69.30	The name of God I with a song
PSA.69.30	most cheerfully will praise;
PSA.69.30	And I, in giving thanks to him,
PSA.69.30	his name shall highly raise.
PSA.69.31	This to the Lord a sacrifice
PSA.69.31	more gracious shall prove
PSA.69.31	Than bullock, ox, or any beast
PSA.69.31	that hath both horn and hoof.
PSA.69.32	When this the humble men shall see,
PSA.69.32	it joy to them shall give:
PSA.69.32	O all ye that do seek the Lord,
PSA.69.32	your hearts shall ever live.
PSA.69.33	For God the poor hears, and will not
PSA.69.33	his prisoners contemn.
PSA.69.34	Let heav'n, and earth, and seas, him praise,
PSA.69.34	and all that move in them.
PSA.69.35	For God will Judah's cities build,
PSA.69.35	and he will Sion save,
PSA.69.35	That they may dwell therein,
PSA.69.35	and it in sure possession have.
PSA.69.36	And they that are his servants' seed
PSA.69.36	inherit shall the same;
PSA.69.36	So shall they have their dwelling there
PSA.69.36	that love his blessed name.
PSA.70.1	Lord, haste me to deliver; with speed,
PSA.70.1	Lord, succor me.
PSA.70.2	Let them that for my soul do seek
PSA.70.2	shamed and confounded be:
PSA.70.2	Turned back be they, and shamed,
PSA.70.2	that in my hurt delight.
PSA.70.3	Turned back be they, Ha, ha! that say,
PSA.70.3	their shaming to requite.
PSA.70.4	In thee let all be glad,
PSA.70.4	and joy that seek for thee:
PSA.70.4	Let them who thy salvation love
PSA.70.4	say still, God praisèd be.
PSA.70.5	I poor and needy am; come, Lord,
PSA.70.5	and make no stay:
PSA.70.5	My help thou and deliv'rer art;
PSA.70.5	O Lord, make no delay.
PSA.71.1	O Lord, my hope and confidence
PSA.71.1	is plac'd in thee alone;
PSA.71.1	Then let thy servant never be
PSA.71.1	put to confusion.
PSA.71.2	And let me, in thy righteousness,
PSA.71.2	from thee deliv'rance have;
PSA.71.2	Cause me escape, incline thine ear unto me,
PSA.71.2	and me save.
PSA.71.3	Be thou my dwelling-rock, to which
PSA.71.3	I ever may resort:
PSA.71.3	Thou gav'st commandment me to save,
PSA.71.3	for thou'rt my rock and fort.
PSA.71.4	Free me, my God, from wicked hands,
PSA.71.4	hands cruel and unjust:
PSA.71.5	For thou, O Lord God, art my hope,
PSA.71.5	and from my youth my trust.
PSA.71.6	Thou from the womb didst hold me up;
PSA.71.6	thou art the same that me
PSA.71.6	Out of my mother's bowels took;
PSA.71.6	I ever will praise thee.
PSA.71.7	To many I a wonder am;
PSA.71.7	but thou'rt my refuge strong.
PSA.71.8	Fill'd let my mouth be with thy praise
PSA.71.8	and honour all day long.
PSA.71.9	O do not cast me off, when as
PSA.71.9	old age doth overtake me;
PSA.71.9	And when my strength decayed is,
PSA.71.9	then do not thou forsake me.
PSA.71.10	For those that are mine enemies
PSA.71.10	against me speak with hate;
PSA.71.10	And they together counsel take
PSA.71.10	that for my soul lay wait.
PSA.71.11	They said, God leaves him; him pursue
PSA.71.11	and take: none will him save.
PSA.71.12	Be thou not far from me, my God:
PSA.71.12	thy speedy help I crave.
PSA.71.13	Confound, consume them, that unto
PSA.71.13	my soul are enemies:
PSA.71.13	Cloth'd be they with reproach and shame
PSA.71.13	that do my hurt devise.
PSA.71.14	But I with expectation
PSA.71.14	will hope continually;
PSA.71.14	And yet with praises more and more
PSA.71.14	I will thee magnify.
PSA.71.15	Thy justice and salvation
PSA.71.15	my mouth abroad shall show,
PSA.71.15	Ev'n all the day; for I thereof
PSA.71.15	the numbers do not know.
PSA.71.16	And I will constantly go on
PSA.71.16	in strength of God the Lord;
PSA.71.16	And thine own righteousness, ev'n thine
PSA.71.16	alone, I will record.
PSA.71.17	For even from my youth, O God,
PSA.71.17	by thee I have been taught;
PSA.71.17	And hitherto I have declar'd
PSA.71.17	the wonders thou hast wrought.
PSA.71.18	And now, Lord, leave me not, when I
PSA.71.18	old and gray-headed grow:
PSA.71.18	Till to this age thy strength and pow'r
PSA.71.18	to all to come I show.
PSA.71.19	And thy most perfect righteousness
PSA.71.19	O Lord, is very high,
PSA.71.19	Who hast so great things done: O God,
PSA.71.19	who is like unto thee?
PSA.71.20	Thou, Lord, who great adversities,
PSA.71.20	and sore, to me didst show,
PSA.71.20	Shalt quicken, and bring me again
PSA.71.20	from depths of earth below.
PSA.71.21	My greatness and my pow'r thou wilt
PSA.71.21	increase, and far extend:
PSA.71.21	On ev'ry side against all grief
PSA.71.21	thou wilt me comfort send.
PSA.71.22	Thee, ev'n thy truth, I'll also praise,
PSA.71.22	my God, with psaltery:
PSA.71.22	Thou Holy One of Israel,
PSA.71.22	with harp I'll sing to thee.
PSA.71.23	My lips shall much rejoice in thee,
PSA.71.23	when I thy praises sound;
PSA.71.23	My soul, which thou redeemed hast,
PSA.71.23	in joy shall much abound.
PSA.71.24	My tongue thy justice shall proclaim,
PSA.71.24	continuing all day long;
PSA.71.24	For they confounded are, and sham'd,
PSA.71.24	that seek to do me wrong.
PSA.72.1	O Lord, thy judgments give the king,
PSA.72.1	his son thy righteousness.
PSA.72.2	With right he shall thy people judge,
PSA.72.2	thy poor with uprightness.
PSA.72.3	The lofty mountains shall bring forth
PSA.72.3	unto the people peace;
PSA.72.3	Likewise the little hills the same
PSA.72.3	shall do by righteousness.
PSA.72.4	The people's poor ones he shall judge,
PSA.72.4	the needy's children save;
PSA.72.4	And those shall he in pieces break
PSA.72.4	who them oppressed have.
PSA.72.5	They shall thee fear, while sun and moon
PSA.72.5	do last, through ages all.
PSA.72.6	Like rain on mown grass he shall drop,
PSA.72.6	or show'rs on earth that fall.
PSA.72.7	The just shall flourish in his days,
PSA.72.7	and prosper in his reign:
PSA.72.7	He shall, while doth the moon endure,
PSA.72.7	abundant peace maintain.
PSA.72.8	His large and great dominion shall
PSA.72.8	from sea to sea extend:
PSA.72.8	It from the river shall reach forth
PSA.72.8	unto earth's utmost end.
PSA.72.9	They in the wilderness that dwell
PSA.72.9	bow down before him must;
PSA.72.9	And they that are his enemies
PSA.72.9	shall lick the very dust.
PSA.72.10	The kings of Tarshish, and the isles,
PSA.72.10	to him shall presents bring;
PSA.72.10	And unto him shall offer gifts
PSA.72.10	Sheba's and Seba's king.
PSA.72.11	Yea, all the mighty kings on earth
PSA.72.11	before him down shall fall;
PSA.72.11	And all the nations of the world
PSA.72.11	do service to him shall.
PSA.72.12	For he the needy shall preserve,
PSA.72.12	when he to him doth call;
PSA.72.12	The poor also, and him that hath
PSA.72.12	no help of man at all.
PSA.72.13	The poor man and the indigent
PSA.72.13	in mercy he shall spare;
PSA.72.13	He shall preserve alive the souls
PSA.72.13	of those that needy are.
PSA.72.14	Both from deceit and violence
PSA.72.14	their soul he shall set free;
PSA.72.14	And in his sight right precious
PSA.72.14	and dear their blood shall be.
PSA.72.15	Yea, he shall live, and giv'n to him
PSA.72.15	shall be of Sheba's gold:
PSA.72.15	For him still shall they pray, and he
PSA.72.15	shall daily be extoll'd.
PSA.72.16	Of corn an handful in the earth
PSA.72.16	on tops of mountains high,
PSA.72.16	With prosp'rous fruit shall shake, like trees
PSA.72.16	on Lebanon that be.
PSA.72.16	The city shall be flourishing,
PSA.72.16	her citizens abound
PSA.72.16	In number shall, like to the grass
PSA.72.16	that grows upon the ground.
PSA.72.17	His name for ever shall endure;
PSA.72.17	last like the sun it shall:
PSA.72.17	Men shall be bless'd in him,
PSA.72.17	and bless'd all nations shall him call.
PSA.72.18	Now blessed be the Lord our God,
PSA.72.18	the God of Israel,
PSA.72.18	For he alone doth wondrous works,
PSA.72.18	in glory that excel.
PSA.72.19	And blessed be his glorious name
PSA.72.19	to all eternity:
PSA.72.19	The whole earth let his glory fill.
PSA.72.19	Amen, so let it be.
PSA.73.1	Yet God is good to Israel,
PSA.73.1	to each pure-hearted one.
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my steps near slipp'd,
PSA.73.2	my feet were almost gone.
PSA.73.3	For I envious was, and grudg'd
PSA.73.3	the foolish folk to see,
PSA.73.3	When I perceiv'd the wicked sort
PSA.73.3	enjoy prosperity.
PSA.73.4	For still their strength continueth firm;
PSA.73.4	their death of bands is free.
PSA.73.5	They are not toil'd like other men,
PSA.73.5	nor plagu'd, as others be.
PSA.73.6	Therefore their pride, like to a chain,
PSA.73.6	them compasseth about;
PSA.73.6	And, as a garment, violence
PSA.73.6	doth cover them throughout.
PSA.73.7	Their eyes stand out with fat; they have
PSA.73.7	more than their hearts could wish.
PSA.73.8	They are corrupt; their talk of wrong
PSA.73.8	both lewd and lofty is.
PSA.73.9	They set their mouth against the heav'ns
PSA.73.9	in their blasphemous talk;
PSA.73.9	And their reproaching tongue throughout
PSA.73.9	the earth at large doth walk.
PSA.73.10	His people oftentimes for this
PSA.73.10	look back, and turn about;
PSA.73.10	Sith waters of so full a cup
PSA.73.10	to these are poured out.
PSA.73.11	And thus they say, How can it be
PSA.73.11	that God these things doth know?
PSA.73.11	Or, Can there in the Highest be
PSA.73.11	knowledge of things below?
PSA.73.12	Behold, these are the wicked ones,
PSA.73.12	yet prosper at their will
PSA.73.12	In worldly things; they do increase
PSA.73.12	in wealth and riches still.
PSA.73.13	I verily have done in vain
PSA.73.13	my heart to purify;
PSA.73.13	To no effect in innocence
PSA.73.13	washed my hands have I.
PSA.73.14	For daily, and all day throughout,
PSA.73.14	great plagues I suffer'd have;
PSA.73.14	Yea, ev'ry morning I of new
PSA.73.14	did chastisement receive.
PSA.73.15	If in this manner foolishly
PSA.73.15	to speak I would intend,
PSA.73.15	Thy children's generation,
PSA.73.15	behold, I should offend.
PSA.73.16	When I this thought to know, it was
PSA.73.16	too hard a thing for me;
PSA.73.17	Till to God's sanctuary I went,
PSA.73.17	then I their end did see.
PSA.73.18	Assuredly thou didst them set
PSA.73.18	a slipp'ry place upon;
PSA.73.18	Them suddenly thou castedst down
PSA.73.18	into destruction.
PSA.73.19	How in a moment suddenly
PSA.73.19	to ruin brought are they!
PSA.73.19	With fearful terrors utterly
PSA.73.19	they are consum'd away.
PSA.73.20	Ev'n like unto a dream, when one
PSA.73.20	from sleeping doth arise;
PSA.73.20	So thou, O Lord, when thou awak'st,
PSA.73.20	their image shalt despise.
PSA.73.21	Thus grieved was my heart in me,
PSA.73.21	and me my reins opprest:
PSA.73.22	So rude was I, and ignorant,
PSA.73.22	and in thy sight a beast.
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless continually,
PSA.73.23	O Lord, I am with thee:
PSA.73.23	Thou dost me hold by my right hand,
PSA.73.23	and still upholdest me.
PSA.73.24	Thou, with thy counsel, while I live,
PSA.73.24	wilt me conduct and guide;
PSA.73.24	And to thy glory afterward
PSA.73.24	receive me to abide.
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in the heavens high
PSA.73.25	but thee, O Lord, alone?
PSA.73.25	And in the earth whom I desire
PSA.73.25	besides thee there is none.
PSA.73.26	My flesh and heart doth faint and fail,
PSA.73.26	but God doth fail me never:
PSA.73.26	For of my heart God is the strength
PSA.73.26	and portion for ever.
PSA.73.27	For, lo, they that are far from thee
PSA.73.27	for ever perish shall;
PSA.73.27	Them that a whoring from thee go
PSA.73.27	thou hast destroyed all.
PSA.73.28	But surely it is good for me
PSA.73.28	that I draw near to God:
PSA.73.28	In God I trust, that all thy works
PSA.73.28	I may declare abroad.
PSA.74.1	O God, why hast thou cast us off?
PSA.74.1	is it for evermore?
PSA.74.1	Against thy pasture-sheep why doth
PSA.74.1	thine anger smoke so sore?
PSA.74.2	O call to thy rememberance
PSA.74.2	thy congregation,
PSA.74.2	Which thou hast purchased of old;
PSA.74.2	still think the same upon:
PSA.74.2	The rod of thine inheritance,
PSA.74.2	which thou redeemed hast,
PSA.74.2	This Sion hill, wherein thou hadst
PSA.74.2	thy dwelling in times past.
PSA.74.3	To these long desolations
PSA.74.3	thy feet lift, do not tarry;
PSA.74.3	For all the ills thy foes have done
PSA.74.3	within thy sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	Amidst thy congregations
PSA.74.4	thine enemies do roar:
PSA.74.4	Their ensigns they set up for signs
PSA.74.4	of triumph thee before.
PSA.74.5	A man was famous, and was had
PSA.74.5	in estimation,
PSA.74.5	According as he lifted up
PSA.74.5	his axe thick trees upon.
PSA.74.6	But all at once with axes now
PSA.74.6	and hammers they go to,
PSA.74.6	And down the carved work thereof
PSA.74.6	they break, and quite undo.
PSA.74.7	They fired have thy sanctuary,
PSA.74.7	and have defil'd the same,
PSA.74.7	By casting down unto the ground
PSA.74.7	the place where dwelt thy name.
PSA.74.8	Thus said they in their hearts, Let us
PSA.74.8	destroy them out of hand:
PSA.74.8	They burnt up all the synagogues
PSA.74.8	of God within the land.
PSA.74.9	Our signs we do not now behold;
PSA.74.9	there is not us among
PSA.74.9	A prophet more, nor any one
PSA.74.9	that knows the time how long.
PSA.74.10	How long, Lord, shall the enemy
PSA.74.10	thus in reproach exclaim?
PSA.74.10	And shall the adversary thus
PSA.74.10	always blaspheme thy name?
PSA.74.11	Thy hand, ev'n thy right hand of might,
PSA.74.11	why dost thou thus draw back?
PSA.74.11	O from thy bosom pluck it out
PSA.74.11	for our deliv'rance sake.
PSA.74.12	For certainly God is my King,
PSA.74.12	ev'n from the times of old,
PSA.74.12	Working in midst of all the earth
PSA.74.12	salvation manifold.
PSA.74.13	The sea, by thy great pow'r, to part
PSA.74.13	asunder thou didst make;
PSA.74.13	And thou the dragons' heads, O Lord,
PSA.74.13	within the waters brake.
PSA.74.14	The leviathan's head thou brak'st
PSA.74.14	in pieces, and didst give
PSA.74.14	Him to be meat unto the folk
PSA.74.14	in wilderness that live.
PSA.74.15	Thou clav'st the fountain and the flood,
PSA.74.15	which did with streams abound:
PSA.74.15	Thou dry'dst the mighty waters up
PSA.74.15	unto the very ground.
PSA.74.16	Thine only is the day, O Lord,
PSA.74.16	thine also is the night;
PSA.74.16	And thou alone prepared hast
PSA.74.16	the sun and shining light.
PSA.74.17	By thee the borders of the earth
PSA.74.17	were settled ev'ry where:
PSA.74.17	The summer and the winter both
PSA.74.17	by thee created were.
PSA.74.18	That th' enemy reproached hath,
PSA.74.18	O keep it in record;
PSA.74.18	And that the foolish people have
PSA.74.18	blasphem'd thy name, O Lord.
PSA.74.19	Unto the multitude do not
PSA.74.19	thy turtle's soul deliver:
PSA.74.19	The congregation of thy poor
PSA.74.19	do not forget for ever.
PSA.74.20	Unto thy cov'nant have respect;
PSA.74.20	for earth's dark places be
PSA.74.20	Full of the habitations
PSA.74.20	of horrid cruelty.
PSA.74.21	O let not those that be oppress'd
PSA.74.21	return again with shame:
PSA.74.21	Let those that poor and needy are
PSA.74.21	give praise unto thy name.
PSA.74.22	Do thou, O God, arise and plead
PSA.74.22	the cause that is thine own:
PSA.74.22	Remember how thou art reproach'd
PSA.74.22	still by the foolish one.
PSA.74.23	Do not forget the voice of those
PSA.74.23	that are thine enemies:
PSA.74.23	Of those the tumult ever grows
PSA.74.23	that do against thee rise.
PSA.75.1	To thee, O God, do we give thanks,
PSA.75.1	we do give thanks to thee;
PSA.75.1	Because thy wondrous works declare
PSA.75.1	thy great name near to be.
PSA.75.2	I purpose, when I shall receive
PSA.75.2	the congregation,
PSA.75.2	That I shall judgment uprightly
PSA.75.2	render to ev'ry one.
PSA.75.3	Dissolved is the land, with all
PSA.75.3	that in the same do dwell;
PSA.75.3	But I the pillars thereof do
PSA.75.3	Bear up, and stablish well.
PSA.75.4	I to the foolish people said,
PSA.75.4	Do not deal foolishly;
PSA.75.4	And unto those that wicked are,
PSA.75.4	Lift not your horn on high.
PSA.75.5	Lift not your horn on high, nor speak
PSA.75.6	with stubborn neck. But know,
PSA.75.6	That not from east, nor west, nor south,
PSA.75.6	promotion doth flow.
PSA.75.7	But God is judge; he puts down one,
PSA.75.7	and sets another up.
PSA.75.8	For in the hand of God most high
PSA.75.8	of red wine is a cup:
PSA.75.8	'Tis full of mixture, he pours forth,
PSA.75.8	and makes the wicked all
PSA.75.8	Wring out the bitter dregs thereof; yea,
PSA.75.8	and they drink them shall.
PSA.75.9	But I for ever will declare,
PSA.75.9	I Jacob's God will praise.
PSA.75.10	All horns of lewd men I'll cut off;
PSA.75.10	but just men's horns will raise.
PSA.76.1	In Judah's land God is well known,
PSA.76.1	his name's in Isr'el great:
PSA.76.2	In Salem is his tabernacle,
PSA.76.2	in Sion is his seat.
PSA.76.3	There arrows of the bow he brake,
PSA.76.3	the shield, the sword, the war.
PSA.76.4	More glorious thou than hills of prey,
PSA.76.4	more excellent art far.
PSA.76.5	Those that were stout of heart are spoil'd,
PSA.76.5	they slept their sleep outright;
PSA.76.5	And none of those their hands did find,
PSA.76.5	that were the men of might.
PSA.76.6	When thy rebuke, O Jacob's God,
PSA.76.6	had forth against them past,
PSA.76.6	Their horses and their chariots both
PSA.76.6	were in a dead sleep cast.
PSA.76.7	Thou, Lord, ev'n thou art he that should
PSA.76.7	be fear'd; and who is he
PSA.76.7	That may stand up before thy sight,
PSA.76.7	if once thou angry be?
PSA.76.8	From heav'n thou judgment caus'd be heard;
PSA.76.8	the earth was still with fear,
PSA.76.9	When God to judgment rose, to save
PSA.76.9	all meek on earth that were.
PSA.76.10	Surely the very wrath of man
PSA.76.10	unto thy praise redounds:
PSA.76.10	Thou to the remnant of his wrath
PSA.76.10	wilt set restraining bounds.
PSA.76.11	Vow to the Lord your God,
PSA.76.11	and pay: all ye that near him be,
PSA.76.11	Bring gifts and presents unto him;
PSA.76.11	for to be fear'd is he.
PSA.76.12	By him the sp'rits shall be cut off
PSA.76.12	of those that princes are:
PSA.76.12	Unto the kings that are on earth
PSA.76.12	he fearful doth appear.
PSA.77.1	Unto the Lord I with my voice,
PSA.77.1	I unto God did cry;
PSA.77.1	Ev'n with my voice,
PSA.77.1	and unto me his ear he did apply.
PSA.77.2	I in my trouble sought the Lord,
PSA.77.2	my sore by night did run,
PSA.77.2	And ceased not; my grieved soul
PSA.77.2	did consolation shun.
PSA.77.3	I to remembrance God did call,
PSA.77.3	yet trouble did remain;
PSA.77.3	And overwhelm'd my spirit was,
PSA.77.3	whilst I did sore complain.
PSA.77.4	Mine eyes, debarr'd from rest and sleep,
PSA.77.4	thou makest still to wake;
PSA.77.4	My trouble is so great that I
PSA.77.4	unable am to speak.
PSA.77.5	The days of old to mind I call'd,
PSA.77.5	and oft did think upon
PSA.77.5	The times and ages that are past
PSA.77.5	full many years agone.
PSA.77.6	By night my song I call to mind,
PSA.77.6	and commune with my heart;
PSA.77.6	My sp'rit did carefully enquire
PSA.77.6	how I might ease my smart.
PSA.77.7	For ever will the Lord cast off,
PSA.77.7	and gracious be no more?
PSA.77.8	For ever is his mercy gone?
PSA.77.8	fails his word evermore?
PSA.77.9	Is't true that to be gracious
PSA.77.9	the Lord forgotten hath?
PSA.77.9	And that his tender mercies he
PSA.77.9	hath shut up in his wrath?
PSA.77.10	Then did I say, That surely this
PSA.77.10	is mine infirmity:
PSA.77.10	I'll mind the years of the right hand
PSA.77.10	of him that is most High.
PSA.77.11	Yea, I remember will the works
PSA.77.11	performed by the Lord:
PSA.77.11	The wonders done of old by thee
PSA.77.11	I surely will record.
PSA.77.12	I also will of all thy works
PSA.77.12	my meditation make;
PSA.77.12	And of thy doings to discourse
PSA.77.12	great pleasure I will take.
PSA.77.13	O God, thy way most holy is
PSA.77.13	within thy sanctuary;
PSA.77.13	And what god is so great in pow'r
PSA.77.13	as is our God most high?
PSA.77.14	Thou art the God that wonders do'st
PSA.77.14	by thy right hand most strong:
PSA.77.14	Thy mighty pow'r thou hast declar'd
PSA.77.14	the nations among.
PSA.77.15	To thine own people with thine arm
PSA.77.15	thou didst redemption bring;
PSA.77.15	To Jacob's sons,
PSA.77.15	and to the tribes of Joseph that do spring.
PSA.77.16	The waters, Lord, perceived thee,
PSA.77.16	the waters saw thee well;
PSA.77.16	And they for fear aside did flee;
PSA.77.16	the depths on trembling fell.
PSA.77.17	The clouds in water forth were pour'd,
PSA.77.17	sound loudly did the sky;
PSA.77.17	And swiftly through the world abroad
PSA.77.17	thine arrows fierce did fly.
PSA.77.18	Thy thunder's voice alongst the heav'n
PSA.77.18	a mighty noise did make;
PSA.77.18	By lightnings lighten'd was the world,
PSA.77.18	th' earth tremble did and shake.
PSA.77.19	Thy way is in the sea, and in
PSA.77.19	the waters great thy path;
PSA.77.19	Yet are thy footsteps hid, O Lord;
PSA.77.19	none knowledge thereof hath.
PSA.77.20	Thy people thou didst safely lead,
PSA.77.20	like to a flock of sheep;
PSA.77.20	By Moses' hand and Aaron's thou
PSA.77.20	didst them conduct and keep.
PSA.78.1	Attend, my people, to my law;
PSA.78.1	thereto give thou an ear;
PSA.78.1	The words that from my mouth proceed
PSA.78.1	attentively do hear.
PSA.78.2	My mouth shall speak a parable,
PSA.78.2	and sayings dark of old;
PSA.78.3	The same which we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	and us our fathers told.
PSA.78.4	We also will them not conceal
PSA.78.4	from their posterity;
PSA.78.4	Them to the generation
PSA.78.4	to come declare will we:
PSA.78.4	The praises of the Lord our God,
PSA.78.4	and his almighty strength,
PSA.78.4	The wondrous works that he hath done,
PSA.78.4	we will shew forth at length.
PSA.78.5	His testimony and his law
PSA.78.5	in Isr'el he did place,
PSA.78.5	And charg'd our fathers it to show
PSA.78.5	to their succeeding race;
PSA.78.6	That so the race which was to come
PSA.78.6	might well them learn and know;
PSA.78.6	And sons unborn, who should arise,
PSA.78.6	might to their sons them show:
PSA.78.7	That they might set their hope in God,
PSA.78.7	and suffer not to fall
PSA.78.7	His mighty works out of their mind,
PSA.78.7	but keep his precepts all:
PSA.78.8	And might not, like their fathers, be
PSA.78.8	a stiff rebellious race;
PSA.78.8	A race not right in heart; with God
PSA.78.8	whose sp'rit not stedfast was.
PSA.78.9	The sons of Ephraim, who nor bows
PSA.78.9	nor other arms did lack,
PSA.78.9	When as the day of battle was,
PSA.78.9	they faintly turned back.
PSA.78.10	They brake God's cov'nant,
PSA.78.10	and refus'd in his commands to go;
PSA.78.11	His works and wonders they forgot,
PSA.78.11	which he to them did show.
PSA.78.12	Things marvellous he brought to pass;
PSA.78.12	their fathers them beheld
PSA.78.12	Within the land of Egypt done,
PSA.78.12	yea, ev'n in Zoan's field.
PSA.78.13	By him divided was the sea,
PSA.78.13	he caus'd them through to pass;
PSA.78.13	And made the waters so to stand,
PSA.78.13	as like an heap it was.
PSA.78.14	With cloud by day, with light of fire
PSA.78.14	all night, he did them guide.
PSA.78.15	In desert rocks he clave,
PSA.78.15	and drink, as from great depths, supply'd.
PSA.78.16	He from the rock brought streams, like floods
PSA.78.16	made waters to run down.
PSA.78.17	Yet sinning more, in desert they
PSA.78.17	provok'd the Highest One.
PSA.78.18	For in their heart they tempted God,
PSA.78.18	and, speaking with mistrust,
PSA.78.18	They greedily did meat require
PSA.78.18	to satisfy their lust.
PSA.78.19	Against the Lord himself they spake,
PSA.78.19	and, murmuring, said thus,
PSA.78.19	A table in the wilderness
PSA.78.19	can God prepare for us?
PSA.78.20	Behold, he smote the rock, and thence
PSA.78.20	came streams and waters great;
PSA.78.20	But can he give his people bread?
PSA.78.20	and send them flesh to eat?
PSA.78.21	The Lord did hear, and waxed wroth;
PSA.78.21	so kindled was a flame
PSA.78.21	'Gainst Jacob, and 'gainst Israel
PSA.78.21	up indignation came.
PSA.78.22	For they believ'd not God, nor trust
PSA.78.22	in his salvation had;
PSA.78.23	Though clouds above he did command,
PSA.78.23	and heav'n's doors open made,
PSA.78.24	And manna rain'd on them,
PSA.78.24	and gave them corn of heav'n to eat.
PSA.78.25	Man angels' food did eat; to them
PSA.78.25	he to the full sent meat.
PSA.78.26	And in the heaven he did cause
PSA.78.26	an eastern wind to blow;
PSA.78.26	And by his power he let out
PSA.78.26	the southern wind to go.
PSA.78.27	Then flesh as thick as dust he made
PSA.78.27	to rain down them among;
PSA.78.27	And feather'd fowls, like as the sand
PSA.78.27	which li'th the shore along.
PSA.78.28	At his command amidst their camp
PSA.78.28	these show'rs of flesh down fell,
PSA.78.28	All round about the tabernacles
PSA.78.28	and tents where they did dwell.
PSA.78.29	So they did eat abundantly,
PSA.78.29	and had of meat their fill;
PSA.78.29	For he did give to them what was
PSA.78.29	their own desire and will.
PSA.78.30	They from their lust had not estrang'd
PSA.78.30	their heart and their desire;
PSA.78.30	But while the meat was in their mouths,
PSA.78.30	which they did so require,
PSA.78.31	God's wrath upon them came,
PSA.78.31	and slew the fattest of them all;
PSA.78.31	So that the choice of Israel,
PSA.78.31	o'erthrown by death, did fall.
PSA.78.32	Yet, notwithstanding of all this,
PSA.78.32	they sinned still the more;
PSA.78.32	And though he had great wonders wrought,
PSA.78.32	believ'd him not therefore:
PSA.78.33	Wherefore their days in vanity
PSA.78.33	he did consume and waste;
PSA.78.33	And by his wrath their wretched years
PSA.78.33	away in trouble past.
PSA.78.34	But when he slew them, then they did
PSA.78.34	to seek him shew desire;
PSA.78.34	Yea, they return'd, and after God
PSA.78.34	right early did enquire.
PSA.78.35	And that the Lord had been their Rock,
PSA.78.35	they did remember then;
PSA.78.35	Ev'n that the high almighty God
PSA.78.35	had their Redeemer been.
PSA.78.36	Yet with their mouth they flatter'd him,
PSA.78.36	and spake but feignedly;
PSA.78.36	And they unto the God of truth
PSA.78.36	with their false tongues did lie.
PSA.78.37	For though their words were good, their heart
PSA.78.37	with him was not sincere;
PSA.78.37	Unstedfast and perfidious
PSA.78.37	they in his cov'nant were.
PSA.78.38	But, full of pity, he forgave
PSA.78.38	their sin, them did not slay;
PSA.78.38	Nor stirr'd up all his wrath, but oft
PSA.78.38	his anger turn'd away.
PSA.78.39	For that they were but fading flesh
PSA.78.39	to mind he did recall;
PSA.78.39	A wind that passeth soon away,
PSA.78.39	and not returns at all.
PSA.78.40	How often did they him provoke
PSA.78.40	within the wilderness!
PSA.78.40	And in the desert did him grieve
PSA.78.40	with their rebelliousness!
PSA.78.41	Yea, turning back, they tempted God,
PSA.78.41	and limits set upon
PSA.78.41	Him, who in midst of Isr'el is
PSA.78.41	the only Holy One.
PSA.78.42	They did not call to mind his pow'r,
PSA.78.42	nor yet the day when he
PSA.78.42	Deliver'd them out of the hand
PSA.78.42	of their fierce enemy;
PSA.78.43	Nor how great signs in Egypt land
PSA.78.43	he openly had wrought;
PSA.78.43	What miracles in Zoan's field
PSA.78.43	his hand to pass had brought.
PSA.78.44	How lakes and rivers ev'ry where
PSA.78.44	he turned into blood;
PSA.78.44	So that nor man nor beast could drink
PSA.78.44	of standing lake or flood.
PSA.78.45	He brought among them swarms of flies,
PSA.78.45	which did them sore annoy;
PSA.78.45	And divers kinds of filthy frogs
PSA.78.45	he sent them to destroy.
PSA.78.46	He to the caterpillar gave
PSA.78.46	the fruits of all their soil;
PSA.78.46	Their labours he deliver'd up
PSA.78.46	unto the locusts' spoil.
PSA.78.47	Their vines with hail, their sycamores
PSA.78.47	he with the frost did blast:
PSA.78.48	Their beasts to hail he gave; their flocks
PSA.78.48	hot thunderbolts did waste.
PSA.78.49	Fierce burning wrath he on them cast,
PSA.78.49	and indignation strong,
PSA.78.49	And troubles sore, by sending forth
PSA.78.49	ill angels them among.
PSA.78.50	He to his wrath made way; their soul
PSA.78.50	from death he did not save;
PSA.78.50	But over to the pestilence
PSA.78.50	the lives of them he gave.
PSA.78.51	In Egypt land the first-born all
PSA.78.51	he smote down ev'ry where;
PSA.78.51	Among the tents of Ham, ev'n these
PSA.78.51	chief of their strength that were.
PSA.78.52	But his own people, like to sheep,
PSA.78.52	thence to go forth he made;
PSA.78.52	And he, amidst the wilderness,
PSA.78.52	them, as a flock, did lead.
PSA.78.53	And he them safely on did lead,
PSA.78.53	so that they did not fear;
PSA.78.53	Whereas their en'mies by the sea
PSA.78.53	quite overwhelmed were.
PSA.78.54	To borders of his sanctuary
PSA.78.54	the Lord his people led,
PSA.78.54	Ev'n to the mount which his right hand
PSA.78.54	for them had purchased.
PSA.78.55	The nations of Canaan,
PSA.78.55	by his almighty hand,
PSA.78.55	Before their face he did expel
PSA.78.55	out of their native land;
PSA.78.55	Which for inheritance to them
PSA.78.55	by line he did divide,
PSA.78.55	And made the tribes of Israel
PSA.78.55	within their tents abide.
PSA.78.56	Yet God most high they did provoke,
PSA.78.56	and tempted ever still;
PSA.78.56	And to observe his testimonies
PSA.78.56	did not incline their will:
PSA.78.57	But, like their fathers, turned back,
PSA.78.57	and dealt unfaithfully:
PSA.78.57	Aside they turned, like a bow
PSA.78.57	that shoots deceitfully.
PSA.78.58	For they to anger did provoke
PSA.78.58	him with their places high;
PSA.78.58	And with their graven images
PSA.78.58	mov'd him to jealousy.
PSA.78.59	When God heard this, he waxed wroth,
PSA.78.59	and much loath'd Isr'el then:
PSA.78.60	So Shiloh's tent he left, the tent
PSA.78.60	which he had plac'd with men.
PSA.78.61	And he his strength delivered
PSA.78.61	into captivity;
PSA.78.61	He left his glory in the hand
PSA.78.61	of his proud enemy.
PSA.78.62	His people also he gave o'er
PSA.78.62	unto the sword's fierce rage:
PSA.78.62	So sore his wrath inflamed was
PSA.78.62	against his heritage.
PSA.78.63	The fire consum'd their choice young men;
PSA.78.63	their maids no marriage had;
PSA.78.64	And when their priests fell by the sword,
PSA.78.64	their wives no mourning made.
PSA.78.65	But then the Lord arose, as one
PSA.78.65	that doth from sleep awake;
PSA.78.65	And like a giant that, by wine
PSA.78.65	refresh'd, a shout doth make:
PSA.78.66	Upon his en'mies' hinder parts
PSA.78.66	he made his stroke to fall;
PSA.78.66	And so upon them he did put
PSA.78.66	a shame perpetual.
PSA.78.67	Moreover, he the tabernacle
PSA.78.67	of Joseph did refuse;
PSA.78.67	The mighty tribe of Ephraim
PSA.78.67	he would in no wise chuse:
PSA.78.68	But he did chuse Jehudah's tribe
PSA.78.68	to be the rest above;
PSA.78.68	And of mount Sion he made choice,
PSA.78.68	which he so much did love.
PSA.78.69	And he his sanctuary built
PSA.78.69	like to a palace high,
PSA.78.69	Like to the earth which he did found
PSA.78.69	to perpetuity.
PSA.78.70	Of David, that his servant was,
PSA.78.70	he also choice did make,
PSA.78.70	And even from the folds of sheep
PSA.78.70	was pleased him to take:
PSA.78.71	From waiting on the ewes with young,
PSA.78.71	he brought him forth to feed
PSA.78.71	Israel, his inheritance,
PSA.78.71	his people, Jacob's seed.
PSA.78.72	So after the integrity
PSA.78.72	he of his heart them fed;
PSA.78.72	And by the good skill of his hands
PSA.78.72	them wisely governed.
PSA.79.1	O God, the heathen enter'd have
PSA.79.1	thine heritage; by them
PSA.79.1	Defiled is thy house: on heaps
PSA.79.1	they laid Jerusalem.
PSA.79.2	The bodies of thy servants they
PSA.79.2	have cast forth to be meat
PSA.79.2	To rav'nous fowls; thy dear saints' flesh
PSA.79.2	they gave to beasts to eat.
PSA.79.3	Their blood about Jerusalem
PSA.79.3	like water they have shed;
PSA.79.3	And there was none to bury them
PSA.79.3	when they were slain and dead.
PSA.79.4	Unto our neighbours a reproach
PSA.79.4	most base become are we;
PSA.79.4	A scorn and laughingstock to them
PSA.79.4	that round about us be.
PSA.79.5	How long, Lord, shall thine anger last?
PSA.79.5	wilt thou still keep the same?
PSA.79.5	And shall thy fervent jealousy
PSA.79.5	burn like unto a flame?
PSA.79.6	On heathen pour thy fury forth,
PSA.79.6	that have thee never known,
PSA.79.6	And on those kingdoms which thy name
PSA.79.6	have never call'd upon.
PSA.79.7	For these are they who Jacob have
PSA.79.7	devoured cruelly;
PSA.79.7	And they his habitation
PSA.79.7	have caused waste to lie.
PSA.79.8	Against us mind not former sins;
PSA.79.8	thy tender mercies show;
PSA.79.8	Let them prevent us speedily,
PSA.79.8	for we're brought very low.
PSA.79.9	For thy name's glory help us, Lord,
PSA.79.9	who hast our Saviour been:
PSA.79.9	Deliver us; for thy name's sake,
PSA.79.9	O purge away our sin.
PSA.79.10	Why say the heathen, Where's their God?
PSA.79.10	let him to them be known;
PSA.79.10	When those who shed thy servants' blood
PSA.79.10	are in our sight o'erthrown.
PSA.79.11	O let the pris'ner's sighs ascend
PSA.79.11	before thy sight on high;
PSA.79.11	Preserve those in thy mighty pow'r
PSA.79.11	that are design'd to die.
PSA.79.12	And to our neighbours' bosom cause
PSA.79.12	it sev'n-fold render'd be,
PSA.79.12	Ev'n the reproach wherewith they have,
PSA.79.12	O Lord, reproached thee.
PSA.79.13	So we thy folk, and pasture-sheep,
PSA.79.13	shall give thee thanks always;
PSA.79.13	And unto generations all
PSA.79.13	we will shew forth thy praise.
PSA.80.1	Hear, Isr'el's Shepherd! like a flock
PSA.80.1	thou that dost Joseph guide;
PSA.80.1	Shine forth, O thou that dost between
PSA.80.1	the cherubims abide.
PSA.80.2	In Ephraim's, and Benjamin's
PSA.80.2	and in Manasseh's sight,
PSA.80.2	O come for our salvation;
PSA.80.2	stir up thy strength and might.
PSA.80.3	Turn us again, O Lord our God,
PSA.80.3	and upon us vouchsafe
PSA.80.3	To make thy countenance to shine,
PSA.80.3	and so we shall be safe.
PSA.80.4	O Lord of hosts, almighty God,
PSA.80.4	how long shall kindled be
PSA.80.4	Thy wrath against the prayer made
PSA.80.4	by thine own folk to thee?
PSA.80.5	Thou tears of sorrow giv'st to them
PSA.80.5	instead of bread to eat;
PSA.80.5	Yea, tears instead of drink thou giv'st
PSA.80.5	to them in measure great.
PSA.80.6	Thou makest us a strife unto
PSA.80.6	our neighbours round about;
PSA.80.6	Our enemies among themselves
PSA.80.6	at us do laugh and flout.
PSA.80.7	Turn us again, O God of hosts,
PSA.80.7	and upon us vouchsafe
PSA.80.7	To make thy countenance to shine,
PSA.80.7	and so we shall be safe.
PSA.80.8	A vine from Egypt brought thou hast,
PSA.80.8	by thine outstretched hand;
PSA.80.8	And thou the heathen out didst cast,
PSA.80.8	to plant it in their land.
PSA.80.9	Before it thou a room didst make,
PSA.80.9	where it might grow and stand;
PSA.80.9	Thou causedst it deep root to take,
PSA.80.9	and it did fill the land.
PSA.80.10	The mountains vail'd were with its shade,
PSA.80.10	as with a covering;
PSA.80.10	Like goodly cedars were the boughs
PSA.80.10	which out from it did spring.
PSA.80.11	Upon the one hand to the sea
PSA.80.11	her boughs she did out send;
PSA.80.11	On th' other side unto the flood
PSA.80.11	her branches did extend.
PSA.80.12	Why hast thou then thus broken down,
PSA.80.12	and ta'en her hedge away?
PSA.80.12	So that all passengers do pluck,
PSA.80.12	and make of her a prey.
PSA.80.13	The boar who from the forest comes
PSA.80.13	doth waste it at his pleasure;
PSA.80.13	The wild beast of the field also
PSA.80.13	devours it out of measure.
PSA.80.14	O God of hosts, we thee beseech,
PSA.80.14	return now unto thine;
PSA.80.14	Look down from heav'n in love, behold,
PSA.80.14	and visit this thy vine:
PSA.80.15	This vineyard, which thine own right hand
PSA.80.15	hath planted us among;
PSA.80.15	And that same branch, which for thyself
PSA.80.15	thou hast made to be strong.
PSA.80.16	Burnt up it is with flaming fire,
PSA.80.16	it also is cut down:
PSA.80.16	They utterly are perished,
PSA.80.16	when as thy face doth frown.
PSA.80.17	O let thy hand be still upon
PSA.80.17	the Man of thy right hand,
PSA.80.17	The Son of man, whom for thyself
PSA.80.17	thou madest strong to stand.
PSA.80.18	So henceforth we will not go back,
PSA.80.18	nor turn from thee at all:
PSA.80.18	O do thou quicken us,
PSA.80.18	and we upon thy name will call.
PSA.80.19	Turn us again,
PSA.80.19	Lord God of hosts,
PSA.80.19	and upon us vouchsafe
PSA.80.19	To make thy countenance to shine,
PSA.80.19	and so we shall be safe.
PSA.81.1	Sing loud to God our strength; with joy
PSA.81.1	to Jacob's God do sing.
PSA.81.2	Take up a psalm, the pleasant harp,
PSA.81.2	timbrel and psalt'ry bring.
PSA.81.3	Blow trumpets at new-moon, what day
PSA.81.3	our feast appointed is:
PSA.81.4	For charge to Isr'el,
PSA.81.4	and a law of Jacob's God was this.
PSA.81.5	To Joseph this a testimony
PSA.81.5	he made, when Egypt land
PSA.81.5	He travell'd through, where speech I heard
PSA.81.5	I did not understand.
PSA.81.6	His shoulder I from burdens took,
PSA.81.6	his hands from pots did free.
PSA.81.7	Thou didst in trouble on me call,
PSA.81.7	and I deliver'd thee:
PSA.81.7	In secret place of thundering
PSA.81.7	I did thee answer make;
PSA.81.7	And at the streams of Meribah
PSA.81.7	of thee a proof did take.
PSA.81.8	O thou, my people, give an ear,
PSA.81.8	I'll testify to thee;
PSA.81.8	To thee, O Isr'el, if thou wilt
PSA.81.8	but hearken unto me.
PSA.81.9	In midst of thee there shall not be
PSA.81.9	any strange god at all;
PSA.81.9	Nor unto any god unknown
PSA.81.9	thou bowing down shalt fall.
PSA.81.10	I am the Lord thy God, which did
PSA.81.10	from Egypt land thee guide;
PSA.81.10	I'll fill thy mouth abundantly,
PSA.81.10	do thou it open wide.
PSA.81.11	But yet my people to my voice
PSA.81.11	would not attentive be;
PSA.81.11	And ev'n my chosen Israel
PSA.81.11	he would have none of me.
PSA.81.12	So to the lust of their own hearts
PSA.81.12	I them delivered;
PSA.81.12	And then in counsels of their own
PSA.81.12	they vainly wandered.
PSA.81.13	O that my people had me heard,
PSA.81.13	Isr'el my ways had chose!
PSA.81.14	I had their en'mies soon subdu'd,
PSA.81.14	my hand turn'd on their foes.
PSA.81.15	The haters of the Lord to him
PSA.81.15	submission should have feign'd;
PSA.81.15	But as for them, their time should have
PSA.81.15	for evermore remain'd.
PSA.81.16	He should have also fed them with
PSA.81.16	the finest of the wheat;
PSA.81.16	Of honey from the rock thy fill
PSA.81.16	I should have made thee eat.
PSA.82.1	In gods' assembly God doth stand;
PSA.82.1	he judgeth gods among.
PSA.82.2	How long, accepting persons vile,
PSA.82.2	will ye give judgment wrong?
PSA.82.3	Defend the poor and fatherless;
PSA.82.3	to poor oppress'd do right.
PSA.82.4	The poor and needy ones set free;
PSA.82.4	rid them from ill men's might.
PSA.82.5	They know not, nor will understand;
PSA.82.5	in darkness they walk on:
PSA.82.5	All the foundations of the earth
PSA.82.5	out of their course are gone.
PSA.82.6	I said that ye are gods, and are
PSA.82.6	sons of the Highest all:
PSA.82.7	But ye shall die like men, and as
PSA.82.7	one of the princes fall.
PSA.82.8	O God, do thou raise up thyself,
PSA.82.8	the earth to judgment call:
PSA.82.8	For thou, as thine inheritance,
PSA.82.8	shalt take the nations all.
PSA.83.1	Keep not, O God, we thee entreat,
PSA.83.1	O keep not silence now:
PSA.83.1	Do thou not hold thy peace, O God,
PSA.83.1	and still no more be thou.
PSA.83.2	For, lo, thine enemies a noise
PSA.83.2	tumultuously have made;
PSA.83.2	And they that haters are of thee
PSA.83.2	have lifted up the head.
PSA.83.3	Against thy chosen people they
PSA.83.3	do crafty counsel take;
PSA.83.3	And they against thy hidden ones
PSA.83.3	do consultations make.
PSA.83.4	Come, let us cut them off, said they,
PSA.83.4	from being a nation,
PSA.83.4	That of the name of Isr'el may
PSA.83.4	no more be mention.
PSA.83.5	For with joint heart they plot, in league
PSA.83.5	against thee they combine.
PSA.83.6	The tents of Edom, Ishm'elites,
PSA.83.6	Moab's and Hagar's line;
PSA.83.7	Gebal, and Ammon, Amalek,
PSA.83.7	Philistines, those of Tyre;
PSA.83.8	And Assur join'd with them, to help
PSA.83.8	Lot's children they conspire.
PSA.83.9	Do to them as to Midian,
PSA.83.9	Jabin at Kison strand;
PSA.83.10	And Sis'ra, which at En-dor fell,
PSA.83.10	as dung to fat the land.
PSA.83.11	Like Oreb and like Zeeb make
PSA.83.11	their noble men to fall;
PSA.83.11	Like Zeba and Zalmunna like,
PSA.83.11	make thou their princes all;
PSA.83.12	Who said, For our possession
PSA.83.12	let us God's houses take.
PSA.83.13	My God, them like a wheel, as chaff
PSA.83.13	before the wind, them make.
PSA.83.14	As fire consumes the wood, as flame
PSA.83.14	doth mountains set on fire,
PSA.83.15	Chase and affright them with the storm
PSA.83.15	and tempest of thine ire.
PSA.83.16	Their faces fill with shame, O Lord,
PSA.83.16	that they may seek thy name.
PSA.83.17	Let them confounded be, and vex'd,
PSA.83.17	and perish in their shame:
PSA.83.18	That men may know that thou, to whom
PSA.83.18	alone doth appertain
PSA.83.18	The name 
PSA.83.18	o'er all the earth remain.
PSA.84.1	How lovely is thy dwelling-place,
PSA.84.1	O Lord of hosts, to me!
PSA.84.1	The tabernacles of thy grace
PSA.84.1	how pleasant, Lord, they be!
PSA.84.2	My thirsty soul longs veh'mently,
PSA.84.2	yea faints, thy courts to see:
PSA.84.2	My very heart and flesh cry out,
PSA.84.2	O living God, for thee.
PSA.84.3	Behold, the sparrow findeth out
PSA.84.3	an house wherein to rest;
PSA.84.3	The swallow also for herself
PSA.84.3	hath purchased a nest;
PSA.84.3	Ev'n thine own altars, where she safe
PSA.84.3	her young ones forth may bring,
PSA.84.3	O thou almighty Lord of hosts,
PSA.84.3	who art my God and King.
PSA.84.4	Bless'd are they in thy house that dwell,
PSA.84.4	they ever give thee praise.
PSA.84.5	Bless'd is the man whose strength thou art,
PSA.84.5	in whose heart are thy ways:
PSA.84.6	Who passing thorough Baca's vale,
PSA.84.6	therein do dig up wells;
PSA.84.6	Also the rain that falleth down
PSA.84.6	the pools with water fills.
PSA.84.7	So they from strength unwearied go
PSA.84.7	still forward unto strength,
PSA.84.7	Until in Sion they appear
PSA.84.7	before the Lord at length.
PSA.84.8	Lord God of hosts, my prayer hear;
PSA.84.8	O Jacob's God, give ear.
PSA.84.9	See God our shield, look on the face
PSA.84.9	of thine anointed dear.
PSA.84.10	For in thy courts one day excels
PSA.84.10	a thousand; rather in
PSA.84.10	My God's house will I keep a door,
PSA.84.10	than dwell in tents of sin.
PSA.84.11	For God the Lord's a sun and shield:
PSA.84.11	he'll grace and glory give;
PSA.84.11	And will withhold no good from them
PSA.84.11	that uprightly do live.
PSA.84.12	O thou that art the Lord of hosts,
PSA.84.12	that man is truly blest,
PSA.84.12	Who by assured confidence
PSA.84.12	on thee alone doth rest.
PSA.85.1	O Lord, thou hast been favourable
PSA.85.1	to thy beloved land:
PSA.85.1	Jacob's captivity thou hast
PSA.85.1	recall'd with mighty hand.
PSA.85.2	Thou pardoned thy people hast
PSA.85.2	all their iniquities;
PSA.85.2	Thou all their trespasses and sins
PSA.85.2	hast cover'd from thine eyes.
PSA.85.3	Thou took'st off all thine ire, and turn'dst
PSA.85.3	from thy wrath's furiousness.
PSA.85.4	Turn us, God of our health, and cause
PSA.85.4	thy wrath 'gainst us to cease.
PSA.85.5	Shall thy displeasure thus endure
PSA.85.5	against us without end?
PSA.85.5	Wilt thou to generations all
PSA.85.5	thine anger forth extend?
PSA.85.6	That in thee may thy people joy,
PSA.85.6	wilt thou not us revive?
PSA.85.7	Shew us thy mercy, Lord, to us
PSA.85.7	do thy salvation give.
PSA.85.8	I'll hear what God the Lord will speak:
PSA.85.8	to his folk he'll speak peace,
PSA.85.8	And to his saints; but let them not
PSA.85.8	return to foolishness.
PSA.85.9	To them that fear him surely near
PSA.85.9	is his salvation;
PSA.85.9	That glory in our land may have
PSA.85.9	her habitation.
PSA.85.10	Truth met with mercy, righteousness
PSA.85.10	and peace kiss'd mutually:
PSA.85.11	Truth springs from earth, and righteousness
PSA.85.11	looks down from heaven high.
PSA.85.12	Yea, what is good the Lord shall give;
PSA.85.12	our land shall yield increase:
PSA.85.13	Justice, to set us in his steps,
PSA.85.13	shall go before his face.
PSA.86.1	O Lord, do thou bow down thine ear,
PSA.86.1	and hear me graciously;
PSA.86.1	Because I sore afflicted am,
PSA.86.1	and am in poverty.
PSA.86.2	Because I'm holy, let my soul
PSA.86.2	by thee preserved be:
PSA.86.2	O thou my God, thy servant save,
PSA.86.2	that puts his trust in thee.
PSA.86.3	Sith unto thee I daily cry,
PSA.86.3	be merciful to me.
PSA.86.4	Rejoice thy servant's soul; for, Lord,
PSA.86.4	I lift my soul to thee.
PSA.86.5	For thou art gracious, O Lord,
PSA.86.5	and ready to forgive;
PSA.86.5	And rich in mercy, all that call
PSA.86.5	upon thee to relieve.
PSA.86.6	Hear, Lord, my pray'r; unto the voice
PSA.86.6	of my request attend:
PSA.86.7	In troublous times I'll call on thee;
PSA.86.7	for thou wilt answer send.
PSA.86.8	Lord, there is none among the gods
PSA.86.8	that may with thee compare;
PSA.86.8	And like the works which thou hast done,
PSA.86.8	not any work is there.
PSA.86.9	All nations whom thou mad'st shall come
PSA.86.9	and worship rev'rently
PSA.86.9	Before thy face; and they, O Lord,
PSA.86.9	thy name shall glorify.
PSA.86.10	Because thou art exceeding great,
PSA.86.10	and works by thee are done
PSA.86.10	Which are to be admir'd; and thou
PSA.86.10	art God thyself alone.
PSA.86.11	Teach me thy way, and in thy truth,
PSA.86.11	O Lord, then walk will I;
PSA.86.11	Unite my heart, that I thy name
PSA.86.11	may fear continually.
PSA.86.12	O Lord my God, with all my heart
PSA.86.12	to thee I will give praise;
PSA.86.12	And I the glory will ascribe
PSA.86.12	unto thy name always:
PSA.86.13	Because thy mercy toward me
PSA.86.13	in greatness doth excel;
PSA.86.13	And thou deliver'd hast my soul
PSA.86.13	out from the lowest hell.
PSA.86.14	O God, the proud against me rise,
PSA.86.14	and vi'lent men have met,
PSA.86.14	That for my soul have sought; and thee
PSA.86.14	before them have not set.
PSA.86.15	But thou art full of pity, Lord,
PSA.86.15	a God most gracious,
PSA.86.15	Long-suffering, and in thy truth
PSA.86.15	and mercy plenteous.
PSA.86.16	O turn to me thy countenance,
PSA.86.16	and mercy on me have;
PSA.86.16	Thy servant strengthen, and the son
PSA.86.16	of thine own handmaid save.
PSA.86.17	Shew me a sign for good, that they
PSA.86.17	which do me hate may see,
PSA.86.17	And be asham'd; because thou, Lord,
PSA.86.17	didst help and comfort me.
PSA.87.1	Upon the hills of holiness
PSA.87.1	he his foundation sets.
PSA.87.2	God, more than Jacob's dwellings all,
PSA.87.2	delights in Sion's gates.
PSA.87.3	Things glorious are said of thee,
PSA.87.3	thou city of the Lord.
PSA.87.4	Rahab and Babel I, to those
PSA.87.4	that know me, will record:
PSA.87.4	Behold ev'n Tyrus, and with it
PSA.87.4	the land of Palestine,
PSA.87.4	And likewise Ethiopia;
PSA.87.4	this man was born therein.
PSA.87.5	And it of Sion shall be said,
PSA.87.5	This man and that man there
PSA.87.5	Was born; and he that is most High
PSA.87.5	himself shall stablish her.
PSA.87.6	When God the people writes, he'll count
PSA.87.6	that this man born was there.
PSA.87.7	There be that sing and play; and all
PSA.87.7	my well-springs in thee are.
PSA.88.1	Lord God, my Saviour, day and night
PSA.88.1	before thee cry'd have I.
PSA.88.2	Before thee let my prayer come;
PSA.88.2	give ear unto my cry.
PSA.88.3	For troubles great do fill my soul;
PSA.88.3	my life draws nigh the grave.
PSA.88.4	I'm counted with those that go down to pit,
PSA.88.4	and no strength have.
PSA.88.5	Ev'n free among the dead, like them
PSA.88.5	that slain in grave do lie;
PSA.88.5	Cut off from thy hand, whom no more
PSA.88.5	thou hast in memory.
PSA.88.6	Thou hast me laid in lowest pit,
PSA.88.6	in deeps and darksome caves.
PSA.88.7	Thy wrath lies hard on me, thou hast
PSA.88.7	me press'd with all thy waves.
PSA.88.8	Thou hast put far from me my friends,
PSA.88.8	thou mad'st them to abhor me;
PSA.88.8	And I am so shut up, that I
PSA.88.8	find no evasion for me.
PSA.88.9	By reason of affliction
PSA.88.9	mine eye mourns dolefully:
PSA.88.9	To thee, Lord, do I call,
PSA.88.9	and stretch my hands continually.
PSA.88.10	Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead?
PSA.88.10	shall they rise, and thee bless?
PSA.88.11	Shall in the grave thy love be told?
PSA.88.11	in death thy faithfulness?
PSA.88.12	Shall thy great wonders in the dark,
PSA.88.12	or shall thy righteousness
PSA.88.12	Be known to any in the land
PSA.88.12	of deep forgetfulness?
PSA.88.13	But, Lord, to thee I cry'd; my pray'r
PSA.88.13	at morn prevent shall thee.
PSA.88.14	Why, Lord, dost thou cast off my soul,
PSA.88.14	and hid'st thy face from me?
PSA.88.15	Distress'd am I, and from my youth
PSA.88.15	I ready am to die;
PSA.88.15	Thy terrors I have borne, and am
PSA.88.15	distracted fearfully.
PSA.88.16	The dreadful fierceness of thy wrath
PSA.88.16	quite over me doth go:
PSA.88.16	Thy terrors great have cut me off,
PSA.88.16	they did pursue me so.
PSA.88.17	For round about me ev'ry day,
PSA.88.17	like water, they did roll;
PSA.88.17	And, gathering together, they
PSA.88.17	have compassed my soul.
PSA.88.18	My friends thou hast put far from me,
PSA.88.18	and him that did me love;
PSA.88.18	And those that mine acquaintance were
PSA.88.18	to darkness didst remove.
PSA.89.1	God's mercies I will ever sing;
PSA.89.1	and with my mouth I shall
PSA.89.1	Thy faithfulness make to be known
PSA.89.1	to generations all.
PSA.89.2	For mercy shall be built, said I,
PSA.89.2	for ever to endure;
PSA.89.2	Thy faithfulness, ev'n in the heav'ns,
PSA.89.2	thou wilt establish sure.
PSA.89.3	I with my chosen One have made
PSA.89.3	a cov'nant graciously;
PSA.89.3	And to my servant, whom I lov'd,
PSA.89.3	to David sworn have I;
PSA.89.4	That I thy seed establish shall
PSA.89.4	for ever to remain,
PSA.89.4	And will to generations all
PSA.89.4	thy throne build and maintain.
PSA.89.5	The praises of thy wonders, Lord,
PSA.89.5	the heavens shall express;
PSA.89.5	And in the congregation
PSA.89.5	of saints thy faithfulness.
PSA.89.6	For who in heaven with the Lord
PSA.89.6	may once himself compare?
PSA.89.6	Who is like God among the sons
PSA.89.6	of those that mighty are?
PSA.89.7	Great fear in meeting of the saints
PSA.89.7	is due unto the Lord;
PSA.89.7	And he of all about him should
PSA.89.7	with rev'rence be ador'd.
PSA.89.8	O thou that art the Lord of hosts,
PSA.89.8	what Lord in mightiness
PSA.89.8	Is like to thee? who compass'd round
PSA.89.8	art with thy faithfulness.
PSA.89.9	Ev'n in the raging of the sea
PSA.89.9	thou over it dost reign;
PSA.89.9	And when the waves thereof do swell,
PSA.89.9	thou stillest them again.
PSA.89.10	Rahab in pieces thou didst break,
PSA.89.10	like one that slaughter'd is;
PSA.89.10	And with thy mighty arm thou hast
PSA.89.10	dispers'd thine enemies.
PSA.89.11	The heav'ns are thine, thou for thine own
PSA.89.11	the earth dost also take;
PSA.89.11	The world, and fulness of the same,
PSA.89.11	thy pow'r did found and make.
PSA.89.12	The north and south from thee alone
PSA.89.12	their first beginning had;
PSA.89.12	Both Tabor mount and Hermon hill
PSA.89.12	shall in thy name be glad.
PSA.89.13	Thou hast an arm that's full of pow'r,
PSA.89.13	thy hand is great in might;
PSA.89.13	And thy right hand exceedingly
PSA.89.13	exalted is in height.
PSA.89.14	Justice and judgment of thy throne
PSA.89.14	are made the dwelling-place;
PSA.89.14	Mercy, accompany'd with truth,
PSA.89.14	shall go before thy face.
PSA.89.15	O greatly bless'd the people are
PSA.89.15	the joyful sound that know;
PSA.89.15	In brightness of thy face, O Lord,
PSA.89.15	they ever on shall go.
PSA.89.16	They in thy name shall all the day
PSA.89.16	rejoice exceedingly;
PSA.89.16	And in thy righteousness shall they
PSA.89.16	exalted be on high.
PSA.89.17	Because the glory of their strength
PSA.89.17	doth only stand in thee;
PSA.89.17	And in thy favour shall our horn
PSA.89.17	and pow'r exalted be.
PSA.89.18	For God is our defence; and he
PSA.89.18	to us doth safety bring:
PSA.89.18	The Holy One of Israel
PSA.89.18	is our almighty King.
PSA.89.19	In vision to thy Holy One
PSA.89.19	thou saidst, I help upon
PSA.89.19	A strong one laid; out of the folk
PSA.89.19	I rais'd a chosen one;
PSA.89.20	Ev'n David, I have found him out
PSA.89.20	a servant unto me;
PSA.89.20	And with my holy oil my King
PSA.89.20	anointed him to be.
PSA.89.21	With whom my hand shall stablish'd be;
PSA.89.21	mine arm shall make him strong.
PSA.89.22	On him the foe shall not exact,
PSA.89.22	nor son of mischief wrong.
PSA.89.23	I will beat down before his face
PSA.89.23	all his malicious foes;
PSA.89.23	I will them greatly plague who do
PSA.89.23	with hatred him oppose.
PSA.89.24	My mercy and my faithfulness
PSA.89.24	with him yet still shall be;
PSA.89.24	And in my name his horn and pow'r
PSA.89.24	men shall exalted see.
PSA.89.25	His hand and pow'r shall reach afar;
PSA.89.25	I'll set it in the sea;
PSA.89.25	And his right hand established
PSA.89.25	shall in the rivers be.
PSA.89.26	Thou art my Father, he shall cry,
PSA.89.26	thou art my God alone;
PSA.89.26	And he shall say, Thou art the Rock
PSA.89.26	of my salvation.
PSA.89.27	I'll make him my first-born, more high
PSA.89.27	than kings of any land.
PSA.89.28	My love I'll ever keep for him,
PSA.89.28	my cov'nant fast shall stand.
PSA.89.29	His seed I by my pow'r will make
PSA.89.29	for ever to endure;
PSA.89.29	And, as the days of heav'n, his throne
PSA.89.29	shall stable be, and sure.
PSA.89.30	But if his children shall forsake
PSA.89.30	my laws, and go astray,
PSA.89.30	And in my judgments shall not walk,
PSA.89.30	but wander from my way:
PSA.89.31	If they my laws break,
PSA.89.31	and do not keep my commandements;
PSA.89.32	I'll visit then their faults with rods,
PSA.89.32	their sins with chastisements.
PSA.89.33	Yet I'll not take my love from him,
PSA.89.33	nor false my promise make.
PSA.89.34	My cov'nant I'll not break, nor change
PSA.89.34	what with my mouth I spake.
PSA.89.35	Once by my holiness I sware,
PSA.89.35	to David I'll not lie;
PSA.89.36	His seed and throne shall, as the sun,
PSA.89.36	before me last for aye.
PSA.89.37	It, like the moon, shall ever be
PSA.89.37	establish'd stedfastly;
PSA.89.37	And like to that which in the heav'n
PSA.89.37	doth witness faithfully.
PSA.89.38	But thou, displeased, hast cast off,
PSA.89.38	thou didst abhor and loathe;
PSA.89.38	With him that thine anointed is
PSA.89.38	thou hast been very wroth.
PSA.89.39	Thou hast thy servant's covenant
PSA.89.39	made void, and quite cast by;
PSA.89.39	Thou hast profan'd his crown, while it
PSA.89.39	cast on the ground doth lie.
PSA.89.40	Thou all his hedges hast broke down,
PSA.89.40	his strong holds down hast torn.
PSA.89.41	He to all passers-by a spoil,
PSA.89.41	to neighbours is a scorn.
PSA.89.42	Thou hast set up his foes' right hand;
PSA.89.42	mad'st all his en'mies glad:
PSA.89.43	Turn'd his sword's edge, and him
PSA.89.43	to stand in battle hast not made.
PSA.89.44	His glory thou hast made to cease,
PSA.89.44	his throne to ground down cast;
PSA.89.45	Shorten'd his days of youth, and him
PSA.89.45	with shame thou cover'd hast.
PSA.89.46	How long, Lord, wilt thou hide thyself?
PSA.89.46	for ever, in thine ire?
PSA.89.46	And shall thine indignation
PSA.89.46	burn like unto a fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember, Lord, how short a time
PSA.89.47	I shall on earth remain:
PSA.89.47	O wherefore is it so that thou
PSA.89.47	has made all men in vain?
PSA.89.48	What man is he that liveth here,
PSA.89.48	and death shall never see?
PSA.89.48	Or from the power of the grave
PSA.89.48	what man his soul shall free?
PSA.89.49	Thy former loving-kindnesses,
PSA.89.49	O Lord, where be they now?
PSA.89.49	Those which in truth and faithfulness
PSA.89.49	to David sworn hast thou?
PSA.89.50	Mind, Lord, thy servant's sad reproach;
PSA.89.50	how I in bosom bear
PSA.89.50	The scornings of the people all,
PSA.89.50	who strong and mighty are.
PSA.89.51	Wherewith thy raging enemies
PSA.89.51	reproach'd, O Lord, think on;
PSA.89.51	Wherewith they have reproach'd the steps
PSA.89.51	of thine anointed one.
PSA.89.52	All blessing to the Lord our God
PSA.89.52	let be ascribed then:
PSA.89.52	For evermore so let it be.
PSA.89.52	Amen, yea, and amen.
PSA.90.1	Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place
PSA.90.1	in generations all.
PSA.90.2	Before thou ever hadst brought forth
PSA.90.2	the mountains great or small;
PSA.90.2	Ere ever thou hadst form'd the earth,
PSA.90.2	and all the world abroad;
PSA.90.2	Ev'n thou from everlasting art
PSA.90.2	to everlasting God.
PSA.90.3	Thou dost unto destruction
PSA.90.3	man that is mortal turn;
PSA.90.3	And unto them thou say'st, Again,
PSA.90.3	ye sons of men, return.
PSA.90.4	Because a thousand years appear
PSA.90.4	no more before thy sight
PSA.90.4	Than yesterday, when it is past,
PSA.90.4	or than a watch by night.
PSA.90.5	As with an overflowing flood
PSA.90.5	thou carry'st them away:
PSA.90.5	They like a sleep are, like the grass
PSA.90.5	that grows at morn are they.
PSA.90.6	At morn it flourishes and grows,
PSA.90.6	cut down at ev'n doth fade.
PSA.90.7	For by thine anger we're consum'd,
PSA.90.7	thy wrath makes us afraid.
PSA.90.8	Our sins thou and iniquities
PSA.90.8	dost in thy presence place,
PSA.90.8	And sett'st our secret faults before
PSA.90.8	the brightness of thy face.
PSA.90.9	For in thine anger all our days
PSA.90.9	do pass on to an end;
PSA.90.9	And as a tale that hath been told,
PSA.90.9	so we our years do spend.
PSA.90.10	Threescore and ten years do sum up
PSA.90.10	our days and years, we see;
PSA.90.10	Or, if, by reason of more strength,
PSA.90.10	in some fourscore they be:
PSA.90.10	Yet doth the strength of such old men
PSA.90.10	but grief and labour prove;
PSA.90.10	For it is soon cut off,
PSA.90.10	and we fly hence, and soon remove.
PSA.90.11	Who knows the power of thy wrath?
PSA.90.11	according to thy fear
PSA.90.12	So is thy wrath: Lord, teach thou us
PSA.90.12	our end in mind to bear;
PSA.90.12	And so to count our days, that we
PSA.90.12	our hearts may still apply
PSA.90.12	To learn thy wisdom and thy truth,
PSA.90.12	that we may live thereby.
PSA.90.13	Turn yet again to us, O Lord,
PSA.90.13	how long thus shall it be?
PSA.90.13	Let it repent thee now for those
PSA.90.13	that servants are to thee.
PSA.90.14	O with thy tender mercies, Lord,
PSA.90.14	us early satisfy;
PSA.90.14	So we rejoice shall all our days,
PSA.90.14	and still be glad in thee.
PSA.90.15	According as the days have been,
PSA.90.15	wherein we grief have had,
PSA.90.15	And years wherein we ill have seen,
PSA.90.15	so do thou make us glad.
PSA.90.16	O let thy work and pow'r appear
PSA.90.16	thy servants' face before;
PSA.90.16	And shew unto their children dear
PSA.90.16	thy glory evermore:
PSA.90.17	And let the beauty of the Lord
PSA.90.17	our God be us upon:
PSA.90.17	Our handy-works establish thou,
PSA.90.17	establish them each one.
PSA.91.1	He that doth in the secret place
PSA.91.1	of the most High reside,
PSA.91.1	Under the shade of him that is
PSA.91.1	th' Almighty shall abide.
PSA.91.2	I of the Lord my God will say,
PSA.91.2	He is my refuge still,
PSA.91.2	He is my fortress, and my God,
PSA.91.2	and in him trust I will.
PSA.91.3	Assuredly he shall thee save,
PSA.91.3	and give deliverance
PSA.91.3	From subtile fowler's snare,
PSA.91.3	and from the noisome pestilence.
PSA.91.4	His feathers shall thee hide; thy trust
PSA.91.4	under his wings shall be:
PSA.91.4	His faithfulness shall be a shield
PSA.91.4	and buckler unto thee.
PSA.91.5	Thou shalt not need to be afraid
PSA.91.5	for terrors of the night;
PSA.91.5	Nor for the arrow that doth fly
PSA.91.5	by day, while it is light;
PSA.91.6	Nor for the pestilence, that walks
PSA.91.6	in darkness secretly;
PSA.91.6	Nor for destruction, that doth waste
PSA.91.6	at noon-day openly.
PSA.91.7	A thousand at thy side shall fall,
PSA.91.7	on thy right hand shall lie
PSA.91.7	Ten thousand dead; yet unto thee
PSA.91.7	it shall not once come nigh.
PSA.91.8	Only thou with thine eyes shalt look,
PSA.91.8	and a beholder be;
PSA.91.8	And thou therein the just reward
PSA.91.8	of wicked men shalt see.
PSA.91.9	Because the Lord, who constantly
PSA.91.9	my refuge is alone,
PSA.91.9	Ev'n the most High, is made by thee
PSA.91.9	thy habitation;
PSA.91.10	No plague shall near thy dwelling come;
PSA.91.10	no ill shall thee befall:
PSA.91.11	For thee to keep in all thy ways
PSA.91.11	his angels charge he shall.
PSA.91.12	They in their hands shall bear thee up,
PSA.91.12	still waiting thee upon;
PSA.91.12	Lest thou at any time should'st dash
PSA.91.12	thy foot against a stone.
PSA.91.13	Upon the adder thou shalt tread,
PSA.91.13	and on the lion strong;
PSA.91.13	Thy feet on dragons trample shall,
PSA.91.13	and on the lions young.
PSA.91.14	Because on me he set his love,
PSA.91.14	I'll save and set him free;
PSA.91.14	Because my great name he hath known,
PSA.91.14	I will him set on high.
PSA.91.15	He'll call on me, I'll answer him;
PSA.91.15	I will be with him still
PSA.91.15	In trouble, to deliver him,
PSA.91.15	and honour him I will.
PSA.91.16	With length of days unto his mind
PSA.91.16	I will him satisfy;
PSA.91.16	I also my salvation
PSA.91.16	will cause his eyes to see.
PSA.92.1	To render thanks unto the Lord
PSA.92.1	it is a comely thing,
PSA.92.1	And to thy name, O thou most High,
PSA.92.1	due praise aloud to sing.
PSA.92.2	Thy loving-kindness to shew forth
PSA.92.2	when shines the morning light;
PSA.92.2	And to declare thy faithfulness
PSA.92.2	with pleasure ev'ry night.
PSA.92.3	On a ten-stringed instrument,
PSA.92.3	upon the psaltery,
PSA.92.3	And on the harp with solemn sound,
PSA.92.3	and grave sweet melody.
PSA.92.4	For thou, Lord, by thy mighty works
PSA.92.4	hast made my heart right glad;
PSA.92.4	And I will triumph in the works
PSA.92.4	which by thine hands were made.
PSA.92.5	How great, Lord, are thy works! each thought
PSA.92.5	of thine a deep it is:
PSA.92.6	A brutish man it knoweth not;
PSA.92.6	fools understand not this.
PSA.92.7	When those that lewd and wicked are
PSA.92.7	spring quickly up like grass,
PSA.92.7	And workers of iniquity
PSA.92.7	do flourish all apace;
PSA.92.7	It is that they for ever may
PSA.92.7	destroyed be and slain;
PSA.92.8	But thou, O Lord, art the most High,
PSA.92.8	for ever to remain.
PSA.92.9	For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord,
PSA.92.9	thine en'mies perish shall;
PSA.92.9	The workers of iniquity
PSA.92.9	shall be dispersed all.
PSA.92.10	But thou shalt, like unto the horn
PSA.92.10	of th' unicorn, exalt
PSA.92.10	My horn on high: thou with fresh oil
PSA.92.10	anoint me also shalt.
PSA.92.11	Mine eyes shall also my desire
PSA.92.11	see on mine enemies;
PSA.92.11	Mine ears shall of the wicked hear
PSA.92.11	that do against me rise.
PSA.92.12	But like the palm-tree flourishing
PSA.92.12	shall be the righteous one;
PSA.92.12	He shall like to the cedar grow
PSA.92.12	that is in Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	Those that within the house of God
PSA.92.13	are planted by his grace,
PSA.92.13	They shall grow up, and flourish all
PSA.92.13	in our God's holy place.
PSA.92.14	And in old age, when others fade,
PSA.92.14	they fruit still forth shall bring;
PSA.92.14	They shall be fat, and full of sap,
PSA.92.14	and aye be flourishing;
PSA.92.15	To shew that upright is the Lord:
PSA.92.15	he is a rock to me;
PSA.92.15	And he from all unrighteousness
PSA.92.15	is altogether free.
PSA.93.1	The Lord doth reign, and cloth'd is he
PSA.93.1	with majesty most bright;
PSA.93.1	His works do shew him cloth'd to be,
PSA.93.1	and girt about with might.
PSA.93.1	The world is also stablished,
PSA.93.1	that it cannot depart.
PSA.93.2	Thy throne is fix'd of old, and thou
PSA.93.2	from everlasting art.
PSA.93.3	The floods,
PSA.93.3	O Lord, have lifted up,
PSA.93.3	they lifted up their voice;
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up their waves,
PSA.93.3	and made a mighty noise.
PSA.93.4	But yet the Lord, that is on high,
PSA.93.4	is more of might by far
PSA.93.4	Than noise of many waters is,
PSA.93.4	or great sea-billows are.
PSA.93.5	Thy testimonies ev'ry one
PSA.93.5	in faithfulness excel;
PSA.93.5	And holiness for ever, Lord,
PSA.93.5	thine house becometh well.
PSA.94.1	O Lord God, unto whom alone
PSA.94.1	all vengeance doth belong;
PSA.94.1	O mighty God, who vengeance own'st,
PSA.94.1	shine forth, avenging wrong.
PSA.94.2	Lift up thyself, thou of the earth
PSA.94.2	the sov'reign Judge that art;
PSA.94.2	And unto those that are so proud
PSA.94.2	a due reward impart.
PSA.94.3	How long, O mighty God, shall they
PSA.94.3	who lewd and wicked be,
PSA.94.3	How long shall they who wicked are
PSA.94.3	thus triumph haughtily?
PSA.94.4	How long shall things most hard by them
PSA.94.4	be uttered and told?
PSA.94.4	And all that work iniquity
PSA.94.4	to boast themselves be bold?
PSA.94.5	Thy folk they break in pieces, Lord,
PSA.94.5	thine heritage oppress:
PSA.94.6	The widow they and stranger slay,
PSA.94.6	and kill the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	Yet say they, God it shall not see,
PSA.94.7	nor God of Jacob know.
PSA.94.8	Ye brutish people! understand;
PSA.94.8	fools! when wise will ye grow?
PSA.94.9	The Lord did plant the ear of man,
PSA.94.9	and hear then shall not he?
PSA.94.9	He only form'd the eye, and
PSA.94.9	then shall he not clearly see?
PSA.94.10	He that the nations doth correct,
PSA.94.10	shall he not chastise you?
PSA.94.10	He knowledge unto man doth teach,
PSA.94.10	and shall himself not know?
PSA.94.11	Man's thoughts to be but vanity
PSA.94.11	the Lord doth well discern.
PSA.94.12	Bless'd is the man thou chast'nest, Lord,
PSA.94.12	and mak'st thy law to learn:
PSA.94.13	That thou may'st give him rest from days
PSA.94.13	of sad adversity,
PSA.94.13	Until the pit be digg'd for those
PSA.94.13	that work iniquity.
PSA.94.14	For sure the Lord will not cast off
PSA.94.14	those that his people be,
PSA.94.14	Neither his own inheritance
PSA.94.14	quit and forsake will he:
PSA.94.15	But judgment unto righteousness
PSA.94.15	shall yet return again;
PSA.94.15	And all shall follow after it
PSA.94.15	that are right-hearted men.
PSA.94.16	Who will rise up for me against
PSA.94.16	those that do wickedly?
PSA.94.16	Who will stand up for me 'gainst those
PSA.94.16	that work iniquity?
PSA.94.17	Unless the Lord had been my help
PSA.94.17	when I was sore opprest,
PSA.94.17	Almost my soul had in the house
PSA.94.17	of silence been at rest.
PSA.94.18	When I had uttered this word,
PSA.94.18	(my foot doth slip away,)
PSA.94.18	Thy mercy held me up, O Lord,
PSA.94.18	thy goodness did me stay.
PSA.94.19	Amidst the multitude of thoughts
PSA.94.19	which in my heart do fight,
PSA.94.19	My soul, lest it be overcharg'd,
PSA.94.19	thy comforts do delight.
PSA.94.20	Shall of iniquity the throne
PSA.94.20	have fellowship with thee,
PSA.94.20	Which mischief, cunningly contriv'd,
PSA.94.20	doth by a law decree?
PSA.94.21	Against the righteous souls they join,
PSA.94.21	they guiltless blood condemn.
PSA.94.22	But of my refuge God's the rock,
PSA.94.22	and my defence from them.
PSA.94.23	On them their own iniquity
PSA.94.23	the Lord shall bring and lay,
PSA.94.23	And cut them off in their own sin;
PSA.94.23	our Lord God shall them slay.
PSA.95.1	O come, let us sing to the Lord:
PSA.95.1	come, let us ev'ry one
PSA.95.1	A joyful noise make to the Rock
PSA.95.1	of our salvation.
PSA.95.2	Let us before his presence come
PSA.95.2	with praise and thankful voice;
PSA.95.2	Let us sing psalms to him with grace,
PSA.95.2	and make a joyful noise.
PSA.95.3	For God, a great God, and great King,
PSA.95.3	above all gods he is.
PSA.95.4	Depths of the earth are in his hand,
PSA.95.4	the strength of hills is his.
PSA.95.5	To him the spacious sea belongs,
PSA.95.5	for he the same did make;
PSA.95.5	The dry land also from his hands
PSA.95.5	its form at first did take.
PSA.95.6	O come, and let us worship him,
PSA.95.6	let us bow down withal,
PSA.95.6	And on our knees before the Lord
PSA.95.6	our Maker let us fall.
PSA.95.7	For he's our God, the people we
PSA.95.7	of his own pasture are,
PSA.95.7	And of his hand the sheep; to-day,
PSA.95.7	if ye his voice will hear,
PSA.95.8	Then harden not your hearts, as in
PSA.95.8	the provocation,
PSA.95.8	As in the desert, on the day
PSA.95.8	of the tentation:
PSA.95.9	When me your fathers tempt'd and prov'd,
PSA.95.9	and did my working see;
PSA.95.10	Ev'n for the space of forty years
PSA.95.10	this race hath grieved me.
PSA.95.10	I said, This people errs in heart,
PSA.95.10	my ways they do not know:
PSA.95.11	To whom I sware in wrath, that to
PSA.95.11	my rest they should not go.
PSA.96.1	O sing a new song to the Lord:
PSA.96.1	sing all the earth to God.
PSA.96.2	To God sing, bless his name, shew still
PSA.96.2	his saving health abroad.
PSA.96.3	Among the heathen nations
PSA.96.3	his glory do declare;
PSA.96.3	And unto all the people shew
PSA.96.3	his works that wondrous are.
PSA.96.4	For great's the Lord,
PSA.96.4	and greatly he is to be magnify'd;
PSA.96.4	Yea, worthy to be fear'd is he
PSA.96.4	above all gods beside.
PSA.96.5	For all the gods are idols dumb,
PSA.96.5	which blinded nations fear;
PSA.96.5	But our God is the Lord, by whom
PSA.96.5	the heav'ns created were.
PSA.96.6	Great honour is before his face,
PSA.96.6	and majesty divine;
PSA.96.6	Strength is within his holy place,
PSA.96.6	and there doth beauty shine.
PSA.96.7	Do ye ascribe unto the Lord,
PSA.96.7	of people ev'ry tribe,
PSA.96.7	Glory do ye unto the Lord,
PSA.96.7	and mighty pow'r ascribe.
PSA.96.8	Give ye the glory to the Lord
PSA.96.8	that to his name is due;
PSA.96.8	Come ye into his courts, and bring
PSA.96.8	an offering with you.
PSA.96.9	In beauty of his holiness,
PSA.96.9	O do the Lord adore;
PSA.96.9	Likewise let all the earth throughout
PSA.96.9	tremble his face before.
PSA.96.10	Among the heathen say, God reigns;
PSA.96.10	the world shall stedfastly
PSA.96.10	Be fix'd from moving; he shall judge
PSA.96.10	the people righteously.
PSA.96.11	Let heav'ns be glad before the Lord,
PSA.96.11	and let the earth rejoice;
PSA.96.11	Let seas, and all that is therein,
PSA.96.11	cry out, and make a noise.
PSA.96.12	Let fields rejoice, and ev'ry thing
PSA.96.12	that springeth of the earth:
PSA.96.12	Then woods and ev'ry tree shall sing
PSA.96.12	with gladness and with mirth
PSA.96.13	Before the Lord; because he comes,
PSA.96.13	to judge the earth comes he:
PSA.96.13	He'll judge the world with righteousness,
PSA.96.13	the people faithfully.
PSA.97.1	God reigneth, let the earth be glad,
PSA.97.1	and isles rejoice each one.
PSA.97.2	Dark clouds him compass; and in right
PSA.97.2	with judgment dwells his throne.
PSA.97.3	Fire goes before him,
PSA.97.3	and his foes it burns up round about:
PSA.97.4	His lightnings lighten did the world; earth saw,
PSA.97.4	and shook throughout.
PSA.97.5	Hills at the presence of the Lord,
PSA.97.5	like wax, did melt away;
PSA.97.5	Ev'n at the presence of the Lord
PSA.97.5	of all the earth, I say.
PSA.97.6	The heav'ns declare his righteousness,
PSA.97.6	all men his glory see.
PSA.97.7	All who serve graven images,
PSA.97.7	confounded let them be.
PSA.97.7	Who do of idols boast themselves,
PSA.97.7	let shame upon them fall:
PSA.97.7	Ye that are called gods, see that
PSA.97.7	ye do him worship all.
PSA.97.8	Sion did hear, and joyful was,
PSA.97.8	glad Judah's daughters were;
PSA.97.8	They much rejoic'd, O Lord, because
PSA.97.8	thy judgments did appear.
PSA.97.9	For thou, O Lord, art high above
PSA.97.9	all things on earth that are;
PSA.97.9	Above all other gods thou art
PSA.97.9	exalted very far.
PSA.97.10	Hate ill, all ye that love the Lord:
PSA.97.10	his saints' souls keepeth he;
PSA.97.10	And from the hands of wicked men
PSA.97.10	he sets them safe and free.
PSA.97.11	For all those that be righteous
PSA.97.11	sown is a joyful light,
PSA.97.11	And gladness sown is for all those
PSA.97.11	that are in heart upright.
PSA.97.12	Ye righteous, in the Lord rejoice;
PSA.97.12	express your thankfulness,
PSA.97.12	When ye into your memory
PSA.97.12	do call his holiness.
PSA.98.1	O sing a new song to the Lord,
PSA.98.1	for wonders he hath done:
PSA.98.1	His right hand and his holy arm
PSA.98.1	him victory hath won.
PSA.98.2	The Lord God his salvation
PSA.98.2	hath caused to be known;
PSA.98.2	His justice in the heathen's sight
PSA.98.2	he openly hath shown.
PSA.98.3	He mindful of his grace and truth
PSA.98.3	to Isr'el's house hath been;
PSA.98.3	And the salvation of our God
PSA.98.3	all ends of th' earth have seen.
PSA.98.4	Let all the earth unto the Lord
PSA.98.4	send forth a joyful noise;
PSA.98.4	Lift up your voice aloud to him,
PSA.98.4	sing praises, and rejoice.
PSA.98.5	With harp, with harp, and voice of psalms,
PSA.98.5	unto 
PSA.98.6	With trumpets, cornets, gladly sound
PSA.98.6	before the Lord the King.
PSA.98.7	Let seas and all their fulness roar;
PSA.98.7	the world, and dwellers there;
PSA.98.8	Let floods clap hands, and let the hills
PSA.98.8	together joy declare
PSA.98.9	Before the Lord; because he comes,
PSA.98.9	to judge the earth comes he:
PSA.98.9	He'll judge the world with righteousness,
PSA.98.9	his folk with equity.
PSA.99.1	Th' eternal Lord doth reign as king,
PSA.99.1	let all the people quake;
PSA.99.1	He sits between the cherubims,
PSA.99.1	let th' earth be mov'd and shake.
PSA.99.2	The Lord in Sion great and high
PSA.99.2	above all people is;
PSA.99.3	Thy great and dreadful name (for it
PSA.99.3	is holy) let them bless.
PSA.99.4	The king's strength also judgment loves;
PSA.99.4	thou settlest equity:
PSA.99.4	Just judgment thou dost execute
PSA.99.4	in Jacob righteously.
PSA.99.5	The Lord our God exalt on high,
PSA.99.5	and rev'rently do ye
PSA.99.5	Before his footstool worship him:
PSA.99.5	the Holy One is he.
PSA.99.6	Moses and Aaron 'mong his priests,
PSA.99.6	Samuel, with them that call
PSA.99.6	Upon his name: these call'd on God,
PSA.99.6	and he them answer'd all.
PSA.99.7	Within the pillar of the cloud
PSA.99.7	he unto them did speak:
PSA.99.7	The testimonies he them taught,
PSA.99.7	and laws, they did not break.
PSA.99.8	Thou answer'dst them, O Lord our God;
PSA.99.8	thou wast a God that gave
PSA.99.8	Pardon to them, though on their deeds
PSA.99.8	thou wouldest vengeance have.
PSA.99.9	Do ye exalt the Lord our God,
PSA.99.9	and at his holy hill
PSA.99.9	Do ye him worship: for the Lord
PSA.99.9	our God is holy still.
PSA.100.1	All people that on earth do dwell,
PSA.100.1	Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
PSA.100.2	Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell,
PSA.100.2	Come ye before him and rejoice.
PSA.100.3	Know that the Lord is God indeed;
PSA.100.3	Without our aid he did us make:
PSA.100.3	We are his flock, he doth us feed,
PSA.100.3	And for his sheep he doth us take.
PSA.100.4	O enter then his gates with praise,
PSA.100.4	Approach with joy his courts unto:
PSA.100.4	Praise, laud, and bless his name always,
PSA.100.4	For it is seemly so to do.
PSA.100.5	For why? the Lord our God is good,
PSA.100.5	His mercy is for ever sure;
PSA.100.5	His truth at all times firmly stood,
PSA.100.5	And shall from age to age endure.
PSA.101.1	I mercy will and judgment sing,
PSA.101.1	Lord, I will sing to thee.
PSA.101.2	With wisdom in a perfect way
PSA.101.2	shall my behaviour be.
PSA.101.2	O when, in kindness unto me,
PSA.101.2	wilt thou be pleas'd to come?
PSA.101.2	I with a perfect heart will walk
PSA.101.2	within my house at home.
PSA.101.3	I will endure no wicked thing
PSA.101.3	before mine eyes to be:
PSA.101.3	I hate their work that turn aside,
PSA.101.3	it shall not cleave to me.
PSA.101.4	A stubborn and a froward heart
PSA.101.4	depart quite from me shall;
PSA.101.4	A person giv'n to wickedness
PSA.101.4	I will not know at all.
PSA.101.5	I'll cut him off that slandereth
PSA.101.5	his neighbour privily:
PSA.101.5	The haughty heart I will not bear,
PSA.101.5	nor him that looketh high.
PSA.101.6	Upon the faithful of the land
PSA.101.6	mine eyes shall be, that they
PSA.101.6	May dwell with me: he shall me serve
PSA.101.6	that walks in perfect way.
PSA.101.7	Who of deceit a worker is
PSA.101.7	in my house shall not dwell;
PSA.101.7	And in my presence shall he not
PSA.101.7	remain that lies doth tell.
PSA.101.8	Yea, all the wicked of the land
PSA.101.8	early destroy will I;
PSA.101.8	All from God's city to cut off
PSA.101.8	that work iniquity.
PSA.102.1	O Lord, unto my pray'r give ear,
PSA.102.1	my cry let come to thee;
PSA.102.2	And in the day of my distress
PSA.102.2	hide not thy face from me.
PSA.102.2	Give ear to me; what time I call,
PSA.102.2	to answer me make haste:
PSA.102.3	For, as an hearth, my bones are burnt,
PSA.102.3	my days, like smoke, do waste.
PSA.102.4	My heart within me smitten is,
PSA.102.4	and it is withered
PSA.102.4	Like very grass; so that I do
PSA.102.4	forget to eat my bread.
PSA.102.5	By reason of my groaning voice
PSA.102.5	my bones cleave to my skin.
PSA.102.6	Like pelican in wilderness
PSA.102.6	forsaken I have been:
PSA.102.6	I like an owl in desert am,
PSA.102.6	that nightly there doth moan;
PSA.102.7	I watch, and like a sparrow am
PSA.102.7	on the house-top alone.
PSA.102.8	My bitter en'mies all the day
PSA.102.8	reproaches cast on me;
PSA.102.8	And, being mad at me, with rage
PSA.102.8	against me sworn they be.
PSA.102.9	For why? I ashes eaten have
PSA.102.9	like bread, in sorrows deep;
PSA.102.9	My drink I also mingled have
PSA.102.9	with tears that I did weep.
PSA.102.10	Thy wrath and indignation
PSA.102.10	did cause this grief and pain;
PSA.102.10	For thou hast lift me up on high,
PSA.102.10	and cast me down again.
PSA.102.11	My days are like unto a shade,
PSA.102.11	which doth declining pass;
PSA.102.11	And I am dry'd and withered,
PSA.102.11	ev'n like unto the grass.
PSA.102.12	But thou, Lord, everlasting art,
PSA.102.12	and thy remembrance shall
PSA.102.12	Continually endure,
PSA.102.12	and be to generations all.
PSA.102.13	Thou shalt arise, and mercy have
PSA.102.13	upon thy Sion yet;
PSA.102.13	The time to favour her is come,
PSA.102.13	the time that thou hast set.
PSA.102.14	For in her rubbish and her stones
PSA.102.14	thy servants pleasure take;
PSA.102.14	Yea, they the very dust thereof
PSA.102.14	do favour for her sake.
PSA.102.15	So shall the heathen people fear
PSA.102.15	the Lord's most holy name;
PSA.102.15	And all the kings on earth shall dread
PSA.102.15	thy glory and thy fame.
PSA.102.16	When Sion by the mighty Lord
PSA.102.16	built up again shall be,
PSA.102.16	In glory then and majesty
PSA.102.16	to men appear shall he.
PSA.102.17	The prayer of the destitute
PSA.102.17	he surely will regard;
PSA.102.17	Their prayer will he not despise,
PSA.102.17	by him it shall be heard.
PSA.102.18	For generations yet to come
PSA.102.18	this shall be on record:
PSA.102.18	So shall the people that shall be
PSA.102.18	created praise the Lord.
PSA.102.19	He from his sanctuary's height
PSA.102.19	hath downward cast his eye;
PSA.102.19	And from his glorious throne in heav'n
PSA.102.19	the Lord the earth did spy;
PSA.102.20	That of the mournful prisoner
PSA.102.20	the groanings he might hear,
PSA.102.20	To set them free that unto death
PSA.102.20	by men appointed are:
PSA.102.21	That they in Sion may declare
PSA.102.21	the Lord's most holy name,
PSA.102.21	And publish in Jerusalem
PSA.102.21	the praises of the same;
PSA.102.22	When as the people gather shall
PSA.102.22	in troops with one accord,
PSA.102.22	When kingdoms shall assembled be
PSA.102.22	to serve the highest Lord.
PSA.102.23	My wonted strength and force he hath
PSA.102.23	abated in the way,
PSA.102.23	And he my days hath shortened:
PSA.102.24	Thus therefore did I say,
PSA.102.24	My God, in mid-time of my days
PSA.102.24	take thou me not away:
PSA.102.24	From age to age eternally
PSA.102.24	thy years endure and stay.
PSA.102.25	The firm foundation of the earth
PSA.102.25	of old time thou hast laid;
PSA.102.25	The heavens also are the work
PSA.102.25	which thine own hands have made.
PSA.102.26	Thou shalt for evermore endure,
PSA.102.26	but they shall perish all;
PSA.102.26	Yea, ev'ry one of them wax old,
PSA.102.26	like to a garment, shall:
PSA.102.26	Thou, as a vesture, shalt them change,
PSA.102.26	and they shall changed be:
PSA.102.27	But thou the same art,
PSA.102.27	and thy years are to eternity.
PSA.102.28	The children of thy servants shall
PSA.102.28	continually endure;
PSA.102.28	And in thy sight, O Lord, their seed
PSA.102.28	shall be establish'd sure.
PSA.103.1	O thou my soul, bless God the Lord;
PSA.103.1	and all that in me is
PSA.103.1	Be stirred up his holy name
PSA.103.1	to magnify and bless.
PSA.103.2	Bless, O my soul, the Lord thy God,
PSA.103.2	and not forgetful be
PSA.103.2	Of all his gracious benefits
PSA.103.2	he hath bestow'd on thee.
PSA.103.3	All thine iniquities who doth
PSA.103.3	most graciously forgive:
PSA.103.3	Who thy diseases all and pains doth heal,
PSA.103.3	and thee relieve.
PSA.103.4	Who doth redeem thy life, that thou
PSA.103.4	to death may'st not go down;
PSA.103.4	Who thee with loving-kindness doth
PSA.103.4	and tender mercies crown:
PSA.103.5	Who with abundance of good things
PSA.103.5	doth satisfy thy mouth;
PSA.103.5	So that, ev'n as the eagle's age,
PSA.103.5	renewed is thy youth.
PSA.103.6	God righteous judgment executes
PSA.103.6	for all oppressed ones.
PSA.103.7	His ways to Moses, he his acts
PSA.103.7	made known to Isr'el's sons.
PSA.103.8	The Lord our God is merciful,
PSA.103.8	and he is gracious,
PSA.103.8	Long-suffering, and slow to wrath,
PSA.103.8	in mercy plenteous.
PSA.103.9	He will not chide continually,
PSA.103.9	nor keep his anger still.
PSA.103.10	With us he dealt not as we sinn'd,
PSA.103.10	nor did requite our ill.
PSA.103.11	For as the heaven in its height
PSA.103.11	the earth surmounteth far;
PSA.103.11	So great to those that do him fear
PSA.103.11	his tender mercies are:
PSA.103.12	As far as east is distant from
PSA.103.12	the west, so far hath he
PSA.103.12	From us removed, in his love,
PSA.103.12	all our iniquity.
PSA.103.13	Such pity as a father hath
PSA.103.13	unto his children dear;
PSA.103.13	Like pity shews the Lord to such
PSA.103.13	as worship him in fear.
PSA.103.14	For he remembers we are dust,
PSA.103.14	and he our frame well knows.
PSA.103.15	Frail man, his days are like the grass,
PSA.103.15	as flow'r in field he grows:
PSA.103.16	For over it the wind doth pass,
PSA.103.16	and it away is gone;
PSA.103.16	And of the place where once it was
PSA.103.16	it shall no more be known.
PSA.103.17	But unto them that do him fear
PSA.103.17	God's mercy never ends;
PSA.103.17	And to their children's children still
PSA.103.17	his righteousness extends:
PSA.103.18	To such as keep his covenant,
PSA.103.18	and mindful are alway
PSA.103.18	Of his most just commandements,
PSA.103.18	that they may them obey.
PSA.103.19	The Lord prepared hath his throne
PSA.103.19	in heavens firm to stand;
PSA.103.19	And ev'ry thing that being hath
PSA.103.19	his kingdom doth command.
PSA.103.20	O ye his angels, that excel
PSA.103.20	in strength, bless ye the Lord;
PSA.103.20	Ye who obey what he commands,
PSA.103.20	and hearken to his word.
PSA.103.21	O bless and magnify the Lord,
PSA.103.21	ye glorious hosts of his;
PSA.103.21	Ye ministers, that do fulfil
PSA.103.21	whate'er his pleasure is.
PSA.103.22	O bless the Lord, all ye his works,
PSA.103.22	wherewith the world is stor'd
PSA.103.22	In his dominions ev'ry where.
PSA.103.22	My soul, bless thou the Lord.
PSA.104.1	Bless God, my soul. O Lord my God,
PSA.104.1	thou art exceeding great;
PSA.104.1	With honour and with majesty
PSA.104.1	thou clothed art in state.
PSA.104.2	With light, as with a robe, thyself
PSA.104.2	thou coverest about;
PSA.104.2	And, like unto a curtain, thou
PSA.104.2	the heavens stretchest out.
PSA.104.3	Who of his chambers doth the beams
PSA.104.3	within the waters lay;
PSA.104.3	Who doth the clouds his chariot make,
PSA.104.3	on wings of wind make way.
PSA.104.4	Who flaming fire his ministers,
PSA.104.4	his angels sp'rits, doth make:
PSA.104.5	Who earth's foundations did lay,
PSA.104.5	that it should never shake.
PSA.104.6	Thou didst it cover with the deep,
PSA.104.6	as with a garment spread:
PSA.104.6	The waters stood above the hills,
PSA.104.6	when thou the word but said.
PSA.104.7	But at the voice of thy rebuke
PSA.104.7	they fled, and would not stay;
PSA.104.7	They at thy thunder's dreadful voice
PSA.104.7	did haste them fast away.
PSA.104.8	They by the mountains do ascend,
PSA.104.8	and by the valley-ground
PSA.104.8	Descend, unto that very place
PSA.104.8	which thou for them didst found.
PSA.104.9	Thou hast a bound unto them set,
PSA.104.9	that they may not pass over,
PSA.104.9	That they do not return again
PSA.104.9	the face of earth to cover.
PSA.104.10	He to the valleys sends the springs,
PSA.104.10	which run among the hills:
PSA.104.11	They to all beasts of field give drink,
PSA.104.11	wild asses drink their fills.
PSA.104.12	By them the fowls of heav'n shall have
PSA.104.12	their habitation,
PSA.104.12	Which do among the branches sing
PSA.104.12	with delectation.
PSA.104.13	He from his chambers watereth
PSA.104.13	the hills, when they are dry'd:
PSA.104.13	With fruit and increase of thy works
PSA.104.13	the earth is satisfy'd.
PSA.104.14	For cattle he makes grass to grow,
PSA.104.14	he makes the herb to spring
PSA.104.14	For th' use of man, that food to him
PSA.104.14	he from the earth may bring;
PSA.104.15	And wine, that to the heart of man
PSA.104.15	doth cheerfulness impart,
PSA.104.15	Oil that his face makes shine,
PSA.104.15	and bread that strengtheneth his heart.
PSA.104.16	The trees of God are full of sap;
PSA.104.16	the cedars that do stand
PSA.104.16	In Lebanon, which planted were
PSA.104.16	by his almighty hand.
PSA.104.17	Birds of the air upon their boughs
PSA.104.17	do chuse their nests to make;
PSA.104.17	As for the stork, the fir-tree she
PSA.104.17	doth for her dwelling take.
PSA.104.18	The lofty mountains for wild goats
PSA.104.18	a place of refuge be;
PSA.104.18	The conies also to the rocks
PSA.104.18	do for their safety flee.
PSA.104.19	He sets the moon in heav'n, thereby
PSA.104.19	the seasons to discern:
PSA.104.19	From him the sun his certain time
PSA.104.19	of going down doth learn.
PSA.104.20	Thou darkness mak'st, 'tis night, then beasts
PSA.104.20	of forests creep abroad.
PSA.104.21	The lions young roar for their prey,
PSA.104.21	and seek their meat from God.
PSA.104.22	The sun doth rise, and home they flock,
PSA.104.22	down in their dens they lie.
PSA.104.23	Man goes to work, his labour he
PSA.104.23	doth to the ev'ning ply.
PSA.104.24	How manifold, Lord, are thy works!
PSA.104.24	in wisdom wonderful
PSA.104.24	Thou ev'ry one of them hast made;
PSA.104.24	earth's of thy riches full:
PSA.104.25	So is this great and spacious sea,
PSA.104.25	wherein things creeping are,
PSA.104.25	Which number'd cannot be; and beasts
PSA.104.25	both great and small are there.
PSA.104.26	There ships go; there thou mak'st to play
PSA.104.26	that leviathan great.
PSA.104.27	These all wait on thee, that thou may'st
PSA.104.27	in due time give them meat.
PSA.104.28	That which thou givest unto them
PSA.104.28	they gather for their food;
PSA.104.28	Thine hand thou open'st lib'rally,
PSA.104.28	they filled are with good.
PSA.104.29	Thou hid'st thy face; they troubled are,
PSA.104.29	their breath thou tak'st away;
PSA.104.29	Then do they die, and to their dust
PSA.104.29	return again do they.
PSA.104.30	Thy quick'ning spirit thou send'st forth,
PSA.104.30	then they created be;
PSA.104.30	And then the earth's decayed face
PSA.104.30	renewed is by thee.
PSA.104.31	The glory of the mighty Lord
PSA.104.31	continue shall for ever:
PSA.104.31	The Lord 
PSA.104.31	in all his works together.
PSA.104.32	Earth, as affrighted, trembleth all,
PSA.104.32	if he on it but look;
PSA.104.32	And if the mountains he but touch,
PSA.104.32	they presently do smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing to the Lord most high,
PSA.104.33	so long as I shall live;
PSA.104.33	And while I being have I shall
PSA.104.33	to my God praises give.
PSA.104.34	Of him my meditation shall
PSA.104.34	sweet thoughts to me afford;
PSA.104.34	And as for me, I will rejoice
PSA.104.34	in God, my only Lord.
PSA.104.35	From earth let sinners be consum'd,
PSA.104.35	let ill men no more be.
PSA.104.35	O thou my soul, bless thou the Lord.
PSA.104.35	Praise to the Lord give ye.
PSA.105.1	Give thanks to God, call on his name;
PSA.105.1	to men his deeds make known.
PSA.105.2	Sing ye to him, sing psalms; proclaim
PSA.105.2	his wondrous works each one.
PSA.105.3	See that ye in his holy name
PSA.105.3	to glory do accord;
PSA.105.3	And let the heart of ev'ry one
PSA.105.3	rejoice that seeks the Lord.
PSA.105.4	The Lord Almighty, and his strength,
PSA.105.4	with stedfast hearts seek ye:
PSA.105.4	His blessed and his gracious face
PSA.105.4	seek ye continually.
PSA.105.5	Think on the works that he hath done,
PSA.105.5	which admiration breed;
PSA.105.5	His wonders, and the judgments all
PSA.105.5	which from his mouth proceed;
PSA.105.6	O ye that are of Abr'ham's race,
PSA.105.6	his servant well approv'n;
PSA.105.6	And ye that Jacob's children are,
PSA.105.6	whom he chose for his own.
PSA.105.7	Because he, and he only, is
PSA.105.7	the mighty Lord our God;
PSA.105.7	And his most righteous judgments are
PSA.105.7	in all the earth abroad.
PSA.105.8	His cov'nant he remember'd hath,
PSA.105.8	that it may ever stand:
PSA.105.8	To thousand generations
PSA.105.8	the word he did command.
PSA.105.9	Which covenant he firmly made
PSA.105.9	with faithful Abraham,
PSA.105.9	And unto Isaac, by his oath,
PSA.105.9	he did renew the same:
PSA.105.10	And unto Jacob, for a law,
PSA.105.10	he made it firm and sure,
PSA.105.10	A covenant to Israel,
PSA.105.10	which ever should endure.
PSA.105.11	He said, I'll give Canaan's land
PSA.105.11	for heritage to you;
PSA.105.12	While they were strangers there,
PSA.105.12	and few, in number very few:
PSA.105.13	While yet they went from land to land
PSA.105.13	without a sure abode;
PSA.105.13	And while through sundry kingdoms they
PSA.105.13	did wander far abroad;
PSA.105.14	Yet, notwithstanding suffer'd he
PSA.105.14	no man to do them wrong:
PSA.105.14	Yea, for their sakes, he did reprove
PSA.105.14	kings, who were great and strong.
PSA.105.15	Thus did he say, Touch ye not those
PSA.105.15	that mine anointed be,
PSA.105.15	Nor do the prophets any harm
PSA.105.15	that do pertain to me.
PSA.105.16	He call'd for famine on the land,
PSA.105.16	he brake the staff of bread:
PSA.105.17	But yet he sent a man before,
PSA.105.17	by whom they should be fed;
PSA.105.17	Ev'n Joseph, whom unnat'rally
PSA.105.17	sell for a slave did they;
PSA.105.18	Whose feet with fetters they did hurt,
PSA.105.18	and he in irons lay;
PSA.105.19	Until the time that his word came
PSA.105.19	to give him liberty;
PSA.105.19	The word and purpose of the Lord
PSA.105.19	did him in prison try.
PSA.105.20	Then sent the king, and did command
PSA.105.20	that he enlarg'd should be:
PSA.105.20	He that the people's ruler was
PSA.105.20	did send to set him free.
PSA.105.21	A lord to rule his family
PSA.105.21	he rais'd him, as most fit;
PSA.105.21	To him of all that he possess'd
PSA.105.21	he did the charge commit:
PSA.105.22	That he might at his pleasure bind
PSA.105.22	the princes of the land;
PSA.105.22	And he might teach his senators
PSA.105.22	wisdom to understand.
PSA.105.23	The people then of Israel
PSA.105.23	down into Egypt came;
PSA.105.23	And Jacob also sojourned
PSA.105.23	within the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	And he did greatly by his pow'r
PSA.105.24	increase his people there;
PSA.105.24	And stronger than their enemies
PSA.105.24	they by his blessing were.
PSA.105.25	Their heart he turned to envy
PSA.105.25	his folk maliciously,
PSA.105.25	With those that his own servants were
PSA.105.25	to deal in subtilty.
PSA.105.26	His servant Moses he did send,
PSA.105.26	Aaron his chosen one.
PSA.105.27	By these his signs and wonders great
PSA.105.27	in Ham's land were made known.
PSA.105.28	Darkness he sent, and made it dark;
PSA.105.28	his word they did obey.
PSA.105.29	He turn'd their waters into blood,
PSA.105.29	and he their fish did slay.
PSA.105.30	The land in plenty brought forth frogs
PSA.105.30	in chambers of their kings.
PSA.105.31	His word all sorts of flies and lice
PSA.105.31	in all their borders brings.
PSA.105.32	He hail for rain, and flaming fire
PSA.105.32	into their land he sent:
PSA.105.33	And he their vines and fig-trees smote:
PSA.105.33	trees of their coasts he rent.
PSA.105.34	He spake, and caterpillars came,
PSA.105.34	locusts did much abound;
PSA.105.35	Which in their land all herbs consum'd,
PSA.105.35	and all fruits of their ground.
PSA.105.36	He smote all first-born in their land,
PSA.105.36	chief of their strength each one.
PSA.105.37	With gold and silver brought them forth,
PSA.105.37	weak in their tribes were none.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when forth they went,
PSA.105.38	their fear on them did light.
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud for covering,
PSA.105.39	and fire to shine by night.
PSA.105.40	They ask'd, and he brought quails:
PSA.105.40	with bread of heav'n he filled them.
PSA.105.41	He open'd rocks, floods gush'd,
PSA.105.41	and ran in deserts like a stream.
PSA.105.42	For on his holy promise he,
PSA.105.42	and servant Abr'ham, thought.
PSA.105.43	With joy his people, his elect
PSA.105.43	with gladness, forth he brought.
PSA.105.44	And unto them the pleasant lands
PSA.105.44	he of the heathen gave;
PSA.105.44	That of the people's labour they
PSA.105.44	inheritance might have.
PSA.105.45	That they his statutes might observe
PSA.105.45	according to his word;
PSA.105.45	And that they might his laws obey.
PSA.105.45	Give praise unto the Lord.
PSA.106.1	Give praise and thanks unto the Lord,
PSA.106.1	for bountiful is he;
PSA.106.1	His tender mercy doth endure
PSA.106.1	unto eternity.
PSA.106.2	God's mighty works who can express?
PSA.106.2	or shew forth all his praise?
PSA.106.3	Blessed are they that judgment keep,
PSA.106.3	and justly do always.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, Lord, with that love
PSA.106.4	which thou to thine dost bear;
PSA.106.4	With thy salvation, O my God,
PSA.106.4	to visit me draw near:
PSA.106.5	That I thy chosen's good may see,
PSA.106.5	and in their joy rejoice;
PSA.106.5	And may with thine inheritance
PSA.106.5	triumph with cheerful voice.
PSA.106.6	We with our fathers sinned have,
PSA.106.6	and of iniquity
PSA.106.6	Too long we have the workers been;
PSA.106.6	we have done wickedly.
PSA.106.7	The wonders great, which thou, O Lord,
PSA.106.7	didst work in Egypt land,
PSA.106.7	Our fathers, though they saw, yet them
PSA.106.7	they did not understand:
PSA.106.7	And they thy mercies' multitude
PSA.106.7	kept not in memory;
PSA.106.7	But at the sea, ev'n the Red sea,
PSA.106.7	provok'd him grievously.
PSA.106.8	Nevertheless he saved them,
PSA.106.8	ev'n for his own name's sake;
PSA.106.8	That so he might to be well known
PSA.106.8	his mighty power make.
PSA.106.9	When he the Red sea did rebuke,
PSA.106.9	then dried up it was:
PSA.106.9	Through depths, as through the wilderness,
PSA.106.9	he safely made them pass.
PSA.106.10	From hands of those that hated them
PSA.106.10	he did his people save;
PSA.106.10	And from the en'my's cruel hand
PSA.106.10	to them redemption gave.
PSA.106.11	The waters overwhelm'd their foes;
PSA.106.11	not one was left alive.
PSA.106.12	Then they believ'd his word,
PSA.106.12	and praise to him in songs did give.
PSA.106.13	But soon did they his mighty works
PSA.106.13	forget unthankfully,
PSA.106.13	And on his counsel and his will
PSA.106.13	did not wait patiently;
PSA.106.14	But much did lust in wilderness,
PSA.106.14	and God in desert tempt.
PSA.106.15	He gave them what they sought, but to
PSA.106.15	their soul he leanness sent.
PSA.106.16	And against Moses in the camp
PSA.106.16	their envy did appear;
PSA.106.16	At Aaron they, the saint of God,
PSA.106.16	envious also were.
PSA.106.17	Therefore the earth did open wide,
PSA.106.17	and Dathan did devour,
PSA.106.17	And all Abiram's company
PSA.106.17	did cover in that hour.
PSA.106.18	Likewise among their company
PSA.106.18	a fire was kindled then;
PSA.106.18	And so the hot consuming flame
PSA.106.18	burnt up these wicked men.
PSA.106.19	Upon the hill of Horeb they
PSA.106.19	an idol-calf did frame,
PSA.106.19	A molten image they did make,
PSA.106.19	and worshipped the same.
PSA.106.20	And thus their glory, and their God,
PSA.106.20	most vainly changed they
PSA.106.20	Into the likeness of an ox
PSA.106.20	that eateth grass or hay.
PSA.106.21	They did forget the mighty God,
PSA.106.21	that had their saviour been,
PSA.106.21	By whom such great things brought to pass
PSA.106.21	they had in Egypt seen.
PSA.106.22	In Ham's land he did wondrous works,
PSA.106.22	things terrible did he,
PSA.106.22	When he his mighty hand and arm
PSA.106.22	stretch'd out at the Red sea.
PSA.106.23	Then said he, He would them destroy,
PSA.106.23	had not, his wrath to stay,
PSA.106.23	His chosen Moses stood in breach,
PSA.106.23	that them he should not slay.
PSA.106.24	Yea, they despis'd the pleasant land,
PSA.106.24	believed not his word:
PSA.106.25	But in their tents they murmured,
PSA.106.25	not heark'ning to the Lord.
PSA.106.26	Therefore in desert them to slay
PSA.106.26	he lifted up his hand:
PSA.106.27	'Mong nations to o'erthrow their seed,
PSA.106.27	and scatter in each land.
PSA.106.28	They unto Baal-peor did
PSA.106.28	themselves associate;
PSA.106.28	The sacrifices of the dead
PSA.106.28	they did profanely eat.
PSA.106.29	Thus, by their lewd inventions,
PSA.106.29	they did provoke his ire;
PSA.106.29	And then upon them suddenly
PSA.106.29	the plague brake in as fire.
PSA.106.30	Then Phin'has rose, and justice did,
PSA.106.30	and so the plague did cease;
PSA.106.31	That to all ages counted was
PSA.106.31	to him for righteousness.
PSA.106.32	And at the waters, where they strove,
PSA.106.32	they did him angry make,
PSA.106.32	In such sort, that it fared ill
PSA.106.32	with Moses for their sake:
PSA.106.33	Because they there his spirit meek
PSA.106.33	provoked bitterly,
PSA.106.33	So that he utter'd with his lips
PSA.106.33	words unadvisedly.
PSA.106.34	Nor, as the Lord commanded them,
PSA.106.34	did they the nations slay:
PSA.106.35	But with the heathen mingled were,
PSA.106.35	and learn'd of them their way.
PSA.106.36	And they their idols serv'd, which did
PSA.106.36	a snare unto them turn.
PSA.106.37	Their sons and daughters they to dev'ls
PSA.106.37	in sacrifice did burn.
PSA.106.38	In their own children's guiltless blood
PSA.106.38	their hands they did imbrue,
PSA.106.38	Whom to Canaan's idols they
PSA.106.38	for sacrifices slew:
PSA.106.38	So was the land defil'd with blood.
PSA.106.39	They stain'd with their own way,
PSA.106.39	And with their own inventions
PSA.106.39	a whoring they did stray.
PSA.106.40	Against his people kindled was
PSA.106.40	the wrath of God therefore,
PSA.106.40	Insomuch that he did his own
PSA.106.40	inheritance abhor.
PSA.106.41	He gave them to the heathen's hand;
PSA.106.41	their foes did them command.
PSA.106.42	Their en'mies them oppress'd, they were
PSA.106.42	made subject to their hand.
PSA.106.43	He many times deliver'd them;
PSA.106.43	but with their counsel so
PSA.106.43	They him provok'd, that for their sin
PSA.106.43	they were brought very low.
PSA.106.44	Yet their affliction he beheld,
PSA.106.44	when he did hear their cry:
PSA.106.45	And he for them his covenant
PSA.106.45	did call to memory;
PSA.106.45	After his mercies' multitude
PSA.106.46	he did repent: And made
PSA.106.46	Them to be pity'd of all those
PSA.106.46	who did them captive lead.
PSA.106.47	O Lord our God, us save,
PSA.106.47	and gather the heathen from among,
PSA.106.47	That we thy holy name may praise
PSA.106.47	in a triumphant song.
PSA.106.48	Bless'd be 
PSA.106.48	to all eternity:
PSA.106.48	Let all the people say, Amen.
PSA.106.48	Praise to the Lord give ye.
PSA.107.1	Praise God, for he is good: for still
PSA.107.1	his mercies lasting be.
PSA.107.2	Let God's redeem'd say so, whom he
PSA.107.2	from th' en'my's hand did free;
PSA.107.3	And gather'd them out of the lands,
PSA.107.3	from north, south, east, nd west.
PSA.107.4	They stray'd in desert's pathless way,
PSA.107.4	no city found to rest.
PSA.107.5	For thirst and hunger in them faints
PSA.107.6	their soul. When straits them press,
PSA.107.6	They cry unto the Lord,
PSA.107.6	and he them frees from their distress.
PSA.107.7	Them also in a way to walk
PSA.107.7	that right is he did guide,
PSA.107.7	That they might to a city go,
PSA.107.7	wherein they might abide.
PSA.107.8	O that men to the Lord would give
PSA.107.8	praise for his goodness then,
PSA.107.8	And for his works of wonder done
PSA.107.8	unto the sons of men!
PSA.107.9	For he the soul that longing is
PSA.107.9	doth fully satisfy;
PSA.107.9	With goodness he the hungry soul
PSA.107.9	doth fill abundantly.
PSA.107.10	Such as shut up in darkness deep,
PSA.107.10	and in death's shade abide,
PSA.107.10	Whom strongly hath affliction bound,
PSA.107.10	and irons fast have ty'd:
PSA.107.11	Because against the words of God
PSA.107.11	they wrought rebelliously,
PSA.107.11	And they the counsel did contemn
PSA.107.11	of him that is most High:
PSA.107.12	Their heart he did bring down with grief,
PSA.107.12	they fell, no help could have.
PSA.107.13	In trouble then they cry'd to God,
PSA.107.13	he them from straits did save.
PSA.107.14	He out of darkness did them bring,
PSA.107.14	and from death's shade them take;
PSA.107.14	These bands, wherewith they had been bound,
PSA.107.14	asunder quite he brake.
PSA.107.15	O that men to the Lord would give
PSA.107.15	praise for his goodness then,
PSA.107.15	And for his works of wonder done
PSA.107.15	unto the sons of men!
PSA.107.16	Because the mighty gates of brass
PSA.107.16	in pieces he did tear,
PSA.107.16	By him in sunder also cut
PSA.107.16	the bars of iron were.
PSA.107.17	Fools, for their sin, and their offence,
PSA.107.17	do sore affliction bear;
PSA.107.18	All kind of meat their soul abhors;
PSA.107.18	they to death's gates draw near.
PSA.107.19	In grief they cry to God; he saves
PSA.107.19	them from their miseries.
PSA.107.20	He sends his word, them heals,
PSA.107.20	and them from their destructions frees.
PSA.107.21	O that men to the Lord would give
PSA.107.21	praise for his goodness then,
PSA.107.21	And for his works of wonder done
PSA.107.21	unto the sons of men!
PSA.107.22	And let them sacrifice to him
PSA.107.22	off 'rings of thankfulness;
PSA.107.22	And let them shew abroad his works
PSA.107.22	in songs of joyfulness.
PSA.107.23	Who go to sea in ships,
PSA.107.23	and in great waters trading be,
PSA.107.24	Within the deep these men God's works
PSA.107.24	and his great wonders see.
PSA.107.25	For he commands,
PSA.107.25	and forth in haste the stormy tempest flies,
PSA.107.25	Which makes the sea with rolling waves
PSA.107.25	aloft to swell and rise.
PSA.107.26	They mount to heav'n, then to the depths
PSA.107.26	they do go down again;
PSA.107.26	Their soul doth faint and melt away
PSA.107.26	with trouble and with pain.
PSA.107.27	They reel and stagger like one drunk,
PSA.107.27	at their wit's end they be:
PSA.107.28	Then they to God in trouble cry,
PSA.107.28	who them from straits doth free.
PSA.107.29	The storm is chang'd into a calm
PSA.107.29	at his command and will;
PSA.107.29	So that the waves, which rag'd before,
PSA.107.29	now quiet are and still.
PSA.107.30	Then are they glad, because at rest
PSA.107.30	and quiet now they be:
PSA.107.30	So to the haven he them brings,
PSA.107.30	which they desir'd to see.
PSA.107.31	O that men to the Lord would give
PSA.107.31	praise for his goodness then,
PSA.107.31	And for his works of wonder done
PSA.107.31	unto the sons of men!
PSA.107.32	Among the people gathered
PSA.107.32	let them exalt his name;
PSA.107.32	Among assembled elders spread
PSA.107.32	his most renowned fame.
PSA.107.33	He to dry land turns water-springs,
PSA.107.33	and floods to wilderness;
PSA.107.34	For sins of those that dwell therein,
PSA.107.34	fat land to barrenness.
PSA.107.35	The burnt and parched wilderness
PSA.107.35	to water-pools he brings;
PSA.107.35	The ground that was dry'd up before
PSA.107.35	he turns to water-springs:
PSA.107.36	And there, for dwelling, he a place
PSA.107.36	doth to the hungry give,
PSA.107.36	That they a city may prepare
PSA.107.36	commodiously to live.
PSA.107.37	There sow they fields, and vineyards plant,
PSA.107.37	to yield fruits of increase.
PSA.107.38	His blessing makes them multiply,
PSA.107.38	lets not their beasts decrease.
PSA.107.39	Again they are diminished,
PSA.107.39	and very low brought down,
PSA.107.39	Through sorrow and affliction,
PSA.107.39	and great oppression.
PSA.107.40	He upon princes pours contempt,
PSA.107.40	and causeth them to stray,
PSA.107.40	And wander in a wilderness,
PSA.107.40	wherein there is no way.
PSA.107.41	Yet setteth he the poor on high
PSA.107.41	from all his miseries,
PSA.107.41	And he, much like unto a flock,
PSA.107.41	doth make him families.
PSA.107.42	They that are righteous shall rejoice,
PSA.107.42	when they the same shall see;
PSA.107.42	And, as ashamed, stop her mouth
PSA.107.42	shall all iniquity.
PSA.107.43	Whoso is wise, and will these things
PSA.107.43	observe, and them record,
PSA.107.43	Ev'n they shall understand the love
PSA.107.43	and kindness of the Lord.
PSA.108.1	My heart is fix'd, Lord; I will sing,
PSA.108.1	and with my glory praise.
PSA.108.2	Awake up psaltery and harp;
PSA.108.2	myself I'll early raise.
PSA.108.3	I'll praise thee 'mong the people, Lord;
PSA.108.3	'mong nations sing will I:
PSA.108.4	For above heav'n thy mercy's great,
PSA.108.4	thy truth doth reach the sky.
PSA.108.5	Be thou above the heavens, Lord,
PSA.108.5	exalted gloriously;
PSA.108.5	Thy glory all the earth above
PSA.108.5	be lifted up on high.
PSA.108.6	That those who thy beloved are
PSA.108.6	delivered may be,
PSA.108.6	O do thou save with thy right hand,
PSA.108.6	and answer give to me.
PSA.108.7	God in his holiness hath said,
PSA.108.7	Herein I will take pleasure;
PSA.108.7	Shechem I will divide, and forth
PSA.108.7	will Succoth's valley measure.
PSA.108.8	Gilead I claim as mine by right;
PSA.108.8	Manasseh mine shall be;
PSA.108.8	Ephraim is of my head the strength;
PSA.108.8	Judah gives laws for me;
PSA.108.9	Moab's my washing-pot; my shoe
PSA.108.9	I'll over Edom throw;
PSA.108.9	Over the land of Palestine
PSA.108.9	I will in triumph go.
PSA.108.10	O who is he will bring me to
PSA.108.10	the city fortify'd?
PSA.108.10	O who is he that to the land
PSA.108.10	of Edom will me guide?
PSA.108.11	O God, thou who hadst cast us off,
PSA.108.11	this thing wilt thou not do?
PSA.108.11	And wilt not thou, ev'n thou, O God,
PSA.108.11	forth with our armies go?
PSA.108.12	Do thou from trouble give us help,
PSA.108.12	for helpless is man's aid.
PSA.108.13	Through God we shall do valiantly;
PSA.108.13	our foes he shall down tread.
PSA.109.1	O thou the God of all my praise,
PSA.109.1	do thou not hold thy peace;
PSA.109.2	For mouths of wicked men to speak
PSA.109.2	against me do not cease:
PSA.109.2	The mouths of vile deceitful men
PSA.109.2	against me open'd be;
PSA.109.2	And with a false and lying tongue
PSA.109.2	they have accused me.
PSA.109.3	They did beset me round about
PSA.109.3	with words of hateful spight:
PSA.109.3	And though to them no cause I gave,
PSA.109.3	against me they did fight.
PSA.109.4	They for my love became my foes,
PSA.109.4	but I me set to pray.
PSA.109.5	Evil for good, hatred for love,
PSA.109.5	to me they did repay.
PSA.109.6	Set thou the wicked over him;
PSA.109.6	and upon his right hand
PSA.109.6	Give thou his greatest enemy,
PSA.109.6	ev'n Satan, leave to stand.
PSA.109.7	And when by thee he shall be judg'd,
PSA.109.7	let him condemned be;
PSA.109.7	And let his pray'r be turn'd to sin,
PSA.109.7	when he shall call on thee.
PSA.109.8	Few be his days, and in his room
PSA.109.8	his charge another take.
PSA.109.9	His children let be fatherless,
PSA.109.9	his wife a widow make.
PSA.109.10	His children let be vagabonds,
PSA.109.10	and beg continually;
PSA.109.10	And from their places desolate
PSA.109.10	seek bread for their supply.
PSA.109.11	Let covetous extortioners
PSA.109.11	catch all he hath away:
PSA.109.11	Of all for which he labour'd hath
PSA.109.11	let strangers make a prey.
PSA.109.12	Let there be none to pity him,
PSA.109.12	let there be none at all
PSA.109.12	That on his children fatherless
PSA.109.12	will let his mercy fall.
PSA.109.13	Let his posterity from earth
PSA.109.13	cut off for ever be,
PSA.109.13	And in the foll'wing age their name
PSA.109.13	be blotted out by thee.
PSA.109.14	Let God his father's wickedness
PSA.109.14	still to remembrance call;
PSA.109.14	And never let his mother's sin
PSA.109.14	be blotted out at all.
PSA.109.15	But let them all before the Lord
PSA.109.15	appear continually,
PSA.109.15	That he may wholly from the earth
PSA.109.15	cut off their memory.
PSA.109.16	Because he mercy minded not,
PSA.109.16	but persecuted still
PSA.109.16	The poor and needy, that he might
PSA.109.16	the broken-hearted kill.
PSA.109.17	As he in cursing pleasure took,
PSA.109.17	so let it to him fall;
PSA.109.17	As he delighted not to bless,
PSA.109.17	so bless him not at all.
PSA.109.18	As cursing he like clothes put on,
PSA.109.18	into his bowels so,
PSA.109.18	Like water, and into his bones,
PSA.109.18	like oil, down let it go.
PSA.109.19	Like to the garment let it be
PSA.109.19	which doth himself array,
PSA.109.19	And for a girdle, wherewith he
PSA.109.19	is girt about alway.
PSA.109.20	From God let this be their reward
PSA.109.20	that en'mies are to me,
PSA.109.20	And their reward that speak against
PSA.109.20	my soul maliciously.
PSA.109.21	But do thou, for thine own name's sake,
PSA.109.21	O God the Lord, for me:
PSA.109.21	Sith good and sweet thy mercy is,
PSA.109.21	from trouble set me free.
PSA.109.22	For I am poor and indigent,
PSA.109.22	afflicted sore am I,
PSA.109.22	My heart within me also is
PSA.109.22	wounded exceedingly.
PSA.109.23	I pass like a declining shade,
PSA.109.23	am like the locust tost:
PSA.109.24	My knees through fasting weaken'd are,
PSA.109.24	my flesh hath fatness lost.
PSA.109.25	I also am a vile reproach
PSA.109.25	unto them made to be;
PSA.109.25	And they that did upon me look
PSA.109.25	did shake their heads at me.
PSA.109.26	O do thou help and succour me,
PSA.109.26	who art my God and Lord:
PSA.109.26	And, for thy tender mercy's sake,
PSA.109.26	safety to me afford:
PSA.109.27	That thereby they may know that this
PSA.109.27	is thy almighty hand;
PSA.109.27	And that thou, Lord, hast done the same,
PSA.109.27	they may well understand.
PSA.109.28	Although they curse with spite, yet, Lord,
PSA.109.28	bless thou with loving voice:
PSA.109.28	Let them asham'd be when they rise;
PSA.109.28	thy servant let rejoice.
PSA.109.29	Let thou mine adversaries all
PSA.109.29	with shame be clothed over;
PSA.109.29	And let their own confusion
PSA.109.29	them, as a mantle, cover.
PSA.109.30	But as for me, I with my mouth
PSA.109.30	will greatly praise the Lord;
PSA.109.30	And I among the multitude
PSA.109.30	his praises will record.
PSA.109.31	For he shall stand at his right hand
PSA.109.31	who is in poverty,
PSA.109.31	To save him from all those that would
PSA.109.31	condemn his soul to die.
PSA.110.1	The Lord did say unto my Lord,
PSA.110.1	Sit thou at my right hand,
PSA.110.1	Until I make thy foes a stool,
PSA.110.1	whereon thy feet may stand.
PSA.110.2	The Lord shall out of Sion send
PSA.110.2	the rod of thy great pow'r:
PSA.110.2	In midst of all thine enemies
PSA.110.2	be thou the governor.
PSA.110.3	A willing people in thy day
PSA.110.3	of pow'r shall come to thee,
PSA.110.3	In holy beauties from morn's womb;
PSA.110.3	thy youth like dew shall be.
PSA.110.4	The Lord himself hath made an oath,
PSA.110.4	and will repent him never,
PSA.110.4	Of th' order of Melchisedec
PSA.110.4	thou art a priest for ever.
PSA.110.5	The glorious and mighty Lord,
PSA.110.5	that sits at thy right hand,
PSA.110.5	Shall, in his day of wrath, strike through
PSA.110.5	kings that do him withstand.
PSA.110.6	He shall among the heathen judge,
PSA.110.6	he shall with bodies dead
PSA.110.6	The places fill: o'er many lands
PSA.110.6	he wound shall ev'ry head.
PSA.110.7	The brook that runneth in the way
PSA.110.7	with drink shall him supply;
PSA.110.7	And, for this cause, in triumph he
PSA.110.7	shall lift his head on high.
PSA.111.1	Praise ye the Lord: with my whole heart
PSA.111.1	I will God's praise declare,
PSA.111.1	Where the assemblies of the just
PSA.111.1	and congregations are.
PSA.111.2	The whole works of the Lord our God
PSA.111.2	are great above all measure,
PSA.111.2	Sought out they are of ev'ry one
PSA.111.2	that doth therein take pleasure.
PSA.111.3	His work most honourable is,
PSA.111.3	most glorious and pure,
PSA.111.3	And his untainted righteousness
PSA.111.3	for ever doth endure.
PSA.111.4	His works most wonderful he hath
PSA.111.4	made to be thought upon:
PSA.111.4	The Lord is gracious,
PSA.111.4	and he is full of compassion.
PSA.111.5	He giveth meat unto all those
PSA.111.5	that truly do him fear;
PSA.111.5	And evermore his covenant
PSA.111.5	he in his mind will bear.
PSA.111.6	He did the power of his works
PSA.111.6	unto his people show,
PSA.111.6	When he the heathen's heritage
PSA.111.6	upon them did bestow.
PSA.111.7	His handy-works are truth and right;
PSA.111.7	all his commands are sure:
PSA.111.8	And, done in truth and uprightness,
PSA.111.8	they evermore endure.
PSA.111.9	He sent redemption to his folk;
PSA.111.9	his covenant for aye
PSA.111.9	He did command: holy his name
PSA.111.9	and rev'rend is alway.
PSA.111.10	Wisdom's beginning is God's fear:
PSA.111.10	good understanding they
PSA.111.10	Have all that his commands fulfill:
PSA.111.10	his praise endures for aye.
PSA.112.1	Praise ye the Lord. The man is bless'd
PSA.112.1	that fears the Lord aright,
PSA.112.1	He who in his commandements
PSA.112.1	doth greatly take delight.
PSA.112.2	His seed and offspring powerful
PSA.112.2	shall be the earth upon:
PSA.112.2	Of upright men blessed shall be
PSA.112.2	the generation.
PSA.112.3	Riches and wealth shall ever be
PSA.112.3	within his house in store;
PSA.112.3	And his unspotted righteousness
PSA.112.3	endures for evermore.
PSA.112.4	Unto the upright light doth rise,
PSA.112.4	though he in darkness be:
PSA.112.4	Compassionate, and merciful,
PSA.112.4	and righteous, is he.
PSA.112.5	A good man doth his favour shew,
PSA.112.5	and doth to others lend:
PSA.112.5	He with discretion his affairs
PSA.112.5	will guide unto the end.
PSA.112.6	Surely there is not any thing
PSA.112.6	that ever shall him move:
PSA.112.6	The righteous man's memorial
PSA.112.6	shall everlasting prove.
PSA.112.7	When he shall evil tidings hear,
PSA.112.7	he shall not be afraid:
PSA.112.7	His heart is fix'd, his confidence
PSA.112.7	upon the Lord is stay'd.
PSA.112.8	His heart is firmly stablished,
PSA.112.8	afraid he shall not be,
PSA.112.8	Until upon his enemies
PSA.112.8	he his desire shall see.
PSA.112.9	He hath dispers'd, giv'n to the poor;
PSA.112.9	his righteousness shall be
PSA.112.9	To ages all; with honour shall
PSA.112.9	his horn be raised high.
PSA.112.10	The wicked shall it see, and fret,
PSA.112.10	his teeth gnash, melt away:
PSA.112.10	What wicked men do most desire
PSA.112.10	shall utterly decay.
PSA.113.1	Praise God: ye servants of the Lord,
PSA.113.1	O praise, the Lord's name praise.
PSA.113.2	Yea, blessed be the name of God
PSA.113.2	from this time forth always.
PSA.113.3	From rising sun to where it sets,
PSA.113.3	God's name is to be prais'd.
PSA.113.4	Above all nations God is high,
PSA.113.4	'bove heav'ns his glory rais'd.
PSA.113.5	Unto the Lord our God that dwells
PSA.113.5	on high, who can compare?
PSA.113.6	Himself that humbleth things to see
PSA.113.6	in heav'n and earth that are.
PSA.113.7	He from the dust doth raise the poor,
PSA.113.7	that very low doth lie;
PSA.113.7	And from the dunghill lifts the man
PSA.113.7	oppress'd with poverty;
PSA.113.8	That he may highly him advance,
PSA.113.8	and with the princes set;
PSA.113.8	With those that of his people are
PSA.113.8	the chief, ev'n princes great.
PSA.113.9	The barren woman house to keep
PSA.113.9	he maketh, and to be
PSA.113.9	Of sons a mother full of joy.
PSA.113.9	Praise to the Lord give ye.
PSA.114.1	When Isr'el out of Egypt went,
PSA.114.1	and did his dwelling change,
PSA.114.1	When Jacob's house went out from those
PSA.114.1	that were of language strange,
PSA.114.2	He Judah did his sanctuary,
PSA.114.2	his kingdom Isr'el make:
PSA.114.3	The sea it saw, and quickly fled,
PSA.114.3	Jordan was driven back.
PSA.114.4	Like rams the mountains, and like lambs
PSA.114.4	the hills skipp'd to and fro.
PSA.114.5	O sea, why fledd'st thou? Jordan, back
PSA.114.5	why wast thou driven so?
PSA.114.6	Ye mountains great, wherefore was it
PSA.114.6	that ye did skip like rams?
PSA.114.6	And wherefore was it, little hills,
PSA.114.6	that ye did leap like lambs?
PSA.114.7	O at the presence of the Lord,
PSA.114.7	earth, tremble thou for fear,
PSA.114.7	While as the presence of the God
PSA.114.7	of Jacob doth appear:
PSA.114.8	Who from the hard and stony rock
PSA.114.8	did standing water bring;
PSA.114.8	And by his pow'r did turn the flint
PSA.114.8	into a water-spring.
PSA.115.1	Not unto us, Lord, not to us,
PSA.115.1	but do thou glory take
PSA.115.1	Unto thy name, ev'n for thy truth,
PSA.115.1	and for thy mercy's sake.
PSA.115.2	O wherefore should the heathen say,
PSA.115.2	Where is their God now gone?
PSA.115.3	But our God in the heavens is,
PSA.115.3	what pleas'd him he hath done.
PSA.115.4	Their idols silver are and gold,
PSA.115.4	work of men's hands they be.
PSA.115.5	Mouths have they, but they do not speak;
PSA.115.5	and eyes, but do not see;
PSA.115.6	Ears have they, but they do not hear;
PSA.115.6	noses, but savour not;
PSA.115.7	Hands, feet, but handle not, nor walk;
PSA.115.7	nor speak they through their throat.
PSA.115.8	Like them their makers are, and all
PSA.115.8	on them their trust that build.
PSA.115.9	O Isr'el, trust thou in the Lord,
PSA.115.9	he is their help and shield.
PSA.115.10	O Aaron's house, trust in the Lord,
PSA.115.10	their help and shield is he.
PSA.115.11	Ye that fear God, trust in the Lord,
PSA.115.11	their help and shield he'll be.
PSA.115.12	The Lord of us hath mindful been,
PSA.115.12	and he will bless us still:
PSA.115.12	He will the house of Isr'el bless,
PSA.115.12	bless Aaron's house he will.
PSA.115.13	Both small and great, that fear the Lord,
PSA.115.13	he will them surely bless.
PSA.115.14	The Lord will you, you and your seed,
PSA.115.14	aye more and more increase.
PSA.115.15	O blessed are ye of the Lord,
PSA.115.15	who made the earth and heav'n.
PSA.115.16	The heav'n, ev'n heav'ns, are God's, but he
PSA.115.16	earth to men's sons hath giv'n.
PSA.115.17	The dead, nor who to silence go,
PSA.115.17	God's praise do not record.
PSA.115.18	But henceforth we for ever will
PSA.115.18	bless God. Praise ye the Lord.
PSA.116.1	I love the Lord, because my voice
PSA.116.1	and prayers he did hear.
PSA.116.2	I, while I live, will call on him,
PSA.116.2	who bow'd to me his ear.
PSA.116.3	Of death the cords and sorrows did
PSA.116.3	about me compass round;
PSA.116.3	The pains of hell took hold on me,
PSA.116.3	I grief and trouble found.
PSA.116.4	Upon the name of God the Lord
PSA.116.4	then did I call, and say,
PSA.116.4	Deliver thou my soul, O Lord,
PSA.116.4	I do thee humbly pray.
PSA.116.5	God merciful and righteous is,
PSA.116.5	yea, gracious is our Lord.
PSA.116.6	God saves the meek: I was brought low,
PSA.116.6	he did me help afford.
PSA.116.7	O thou my soul, do thou return
PSA.116.7	unto thy quiet rest;
PSA.116.7	For largely, lo, the Lord to thee
PSA.116.7	his bounty hath exprest.
PSA.116.8	For my distressed soul from death
PSA.116.8	deliver'd was by thee:
PSA.116.8	Thou didst my mourning eyes from tears,
PSA.116.8	my feet from falling, free.
PSA.116.9	I in the land of those that live
PSA.116.9	will walk the Lord before.
PSA.116.10	I did believe, therefore I spake:
PSA.116.10	I was afflicted sore.
PSA.116.11	I said, when I was in my haste,
PSA.116.11	that all men liars be.
PSA.116.12	What shall I render to the Lord
PSA.116.12	for all his gifts to me?
PSA.116.13	I'll of salvation take the cup,
PSA.116.13	on God's name will I call:
PSA.116.14	I'll pay my vows now to the Lord
PSA.116.14	before his people all.
PSA.116.15	Dear in God's sight is his saints' death.
PSA.116.16	Thy servant, Lord, am I;
PSA.116.16	Thy servant sure, thine handmaid's son:
PSA.116.16	my bands thou didst untie.
PSA.116.17	Thank-off 'rings I to thee will give,
PSA.116.17	and on God's name will call.
PSA.116.18	I'll pay my vows now to the Lord
PSA.116.18	before his people all;
PSA.116.19	Within the courts of God's own house,
PSA.116.19	within the midst of thee,
PSA.116.19	O city of Jerusalem.
PSA.116.19	Praise to the Lord give ye.
PSA.117.1	O give ye praise unto the Lord,
PSA.117.1	all nations that be;
PSA.117.1	Likewise, ye people all, accord
PSA.117.1	his name to magnify.
PSA.117.2	For great to us-ward ever are
PSA.117.2	his loving-kindnesses:
PSA.117.2	His truth endures for evermore.
PSA.117.2	The Lord O do ye bless.
PSA.118.1	O praise the Lord, for he is good;
PSA.118.1	his mercy lasteth ever.
PSA.118.2	Let those of Israel now say,
PSA.118.2	His mercy faileth never.
PSA.118.3	Now let the house of Aaron say,
PSA.118.3	His mercy lasteth ever.
PSA.118.4	Let those that fear the Lord now say,
PSA.118.4	His mercy faileth never.
PSA.118.5	I in distress call'd on the Lord;
PSA.118.5	the Lord did answer me:
PSA.118.5	He in a large place did me set,
PSA.118.5	from trouble made me free.
PSA.118.6	The mighty Lord is on my side,
PSA.118.6	I will not be afraid;
PSA.118.6	For any thing that man can do
PSA.118.6	I shall not be dismay'd.
PSA.118.7	The Lord doth take my part with them
PSA.118.7	that help to succour me:
PSA.118.7	Therefore on those that do me hate
PSA.118.7	I my desire shall see.
PSA.118.8	Better it is to trust in God
PSA.118.8	than trust in man's defence;
PSA.118.9	Better to trust in God than make
PSA.118.9	princes our confidence.
PSA.118.10	The nations, joining all in one,
PSA.118.10	did compass me about:
PSA.118.10	But in the Lord's most holy name
PSA.118.10	I shall them all root out.
PSA.118.11	They compass'd me about; I say,
PSA.118.11	they compass'd me about:
PSA.118.11	But in the Lord's most holy name
PSA.118.11	I shall them all root out.
PSA.118.12	Like bees they compass'd me about;
PSA.118.12	like unto thorns that flame
PSA.118.12	They quenched are: for them shall I
PSA.118.12	destroy in God's own name.
PSA.118.13	Thou sore hast thrust, that I might fall,
PSA.118.13	but my Lord helped me.
PSA.118.14	God my salvation is become,
PSA.118.14	my strength and song is he.
PSA.118.15	In dwellings of the righteous
PSA.118.15	is heard the melody
PSA.118.15	Of joy and health: the Lord's right hand
PSA.118.15	doth ever valiantly.
PSA.118.16	The right hand of the mighty Lord
PSA.118.16	exalted is on high;
PSA.118.16	The right hand of the mighty Lord
PSA.118.16	doth ever valiantly.
PSA.118.17	I shall not die, but live,
PSA.118.17	and shall the works of God discover.
PSA.118.18	The Lord hath me chastised sore,
PSA.118.18	but not to death giv'n over.
PSA.118.19	O set ye open unto me
PSA.118.19	the gates of righteousness;
PSA.118.19	Then will I enter into them,
PSA.118.19	and I the Lord will bless.
PSA.118.20	This is the gate of God, by it
PSA.118.20	the just shall enter in.
PSA.118.21	Thee will I praise, for thou me heard'st
PSA.118.21	and hast my safety been.
PSA.118.22	That stone is made head corner-stone,
PSA.118.22	which builders did despise:
PSA.118.23	This is the doing of the Lord,
PSA.118.23	and wondrous in our eyes.
PSA.118.24	This is the day God made, in it
PSA.118.24	we'll joy triumphantly.
PSA.118.25	Save now, I pray thee, Lord; I pray,
PSA.118.25	send now prosperity.
PSA.118.26	Blessed is he in God's great name
PSA.118.26	that cometh us to save:
PSA.118.26	We, from the house which to the Lord
PSA.118.26	pertains, you blessed have.
PSA.118.27	God is the Lord, who unto us
PSA.118.27	hath made light to arise:
PSA.118.27	Bind ye unto the altar's horns
PSA.118.27	with cords the sacrifice.
PSA.118.28	Thou art my God, I'll thee exalt;
PSA.118.28	my God, I will thee praise.
PSA.118.29	Give thanks to God, for he is good:
PSA.118.29	his mercy lasts always.
PSA.119.1	Blessed are they that undefil'd,
PSA.119.1	and straight are in the way;
PSA.119.1	Who in the Lord's most holy law do walk,
PSA.119.1	and do not stray.
PSA.119.2	Blessed are they who to observe
PSA.119.2	his statutes are inclin'd;
PSA.119.2	And who do seek the living God
PSA.119.2	with their whole heart and mind.
PSA.119.3	Such in his ways do walk,
PSA.119.3	and they do no iniquity.
PSA.119.4	Thou hast commanded us to keep
PSA.119.4	thy precepts carefully.
PSA.119.5	O that thy statutes to observe
PSA.119.5	thou would'st my ways direct!
PSA.119.6	Then shall I not be sham'd, when I
PSA.119.6	thy precepts all respect.
PSA.119.7	Then with integrity of heart
PSA.119.7	thee will I praise and bless,
PSA.119.7	When I the judgments all have learn'd
PSA.119.7	of thy pure righteousness.
PSA.119.8	That I will keep thy statutes all
PSA.119.8	firmly resolv'd have I:
PSA.119.8	O do not then, most gracious God,
PSA.119.8	forsake me utterly.
PSA.119.9	By what means shall a young man learn
PSA.119.9	his way to purify?
PSA.119.9	If he according to thy word
PSA.119.9	thereto attentive be.
PSA.119.10	Unfeignedly thee have I sought
PSA.119.10	with all my soul and heart:
PSA.119.10	O let me not from the right path
PSA.119.10	of thy commands depart.
PSA.119.11	Thy word I in my heart have hid,
PSA.119.11	that I offend not thee.
PSA.119.12	O Lord, thou ever blessed art,
PSA.119.12	thy statutes teach thou me.
PSA.119.13	The judgments of thy mouth each one
PSA.119.13	my lips declared have:
PSA.119.14	More joy thy testimonies' way
PSA.119.14	than riches all me gave.
PSA.119.15	I will thy holy precepts make
PSA.119.15	my meditation;
PSA.119.15	And carefully I'll have respect
PSA.119.15	unto thy ways each one.
PSA.119.16	Upon thy statutes my delight
PSA.119.16	shall constantly be set:
PSA.119.16	And, by thy grace, I never will
PSA.119.16	thy holy word forget.
PSA.119.17	With me thy servant, in thy grace,
PSA.119.17	deal bountifully, Lord:
PSA.119.17	That by thy favor I may live,
PSA.119.17	and duly keep thy word.
PSA.119.18	Open mine eyes, that of thy law
PSA.119.18	the wonders I may see.
PSA.119.19	I am a stranger on this earth,
PSA.119.19	hide not thy laws from me.
PSA.119.20	My soul within me breaks,
PSA.119.20	and doth much fainting still endure,
PSA.119.20	Through longing that it hath all times
PSA.119.20	unto thy judgments pure.
PSA.119.21	Thou hast rebuk'd the cursed proud,
PSA.119.21	who from thy precepts swerve.
PSA.119.22	Reproach and shame remove from me,
PSA.119.22	for I thy laws observe.
PSA.119.23	Against me princes spake with spite,
PSA.119.23	while they in council sat:
PSA.119.23	But I thy servant did upon
PSA.119.23	thy statutes meditate.
PSA.119.24	My comfort, and my heart's delight,
PSA.119.24	thy testimonies be;
PSA.119.24	And they, in all my doubts and fears,
PSA.119.24	are counsellors to me.
PSA.119.25	My soul to dust cleaves: quicken me,
PSA.119.25	according to thy word.
PSA.119.26	My ways I shew'd, and me thou heard'st:
PSA.119.26	teach me thy statutes, Lord.
PSA.119.27	The way of thy commandements
PSA.119.27	make me aright to know;
PSA.119.27	So all thy works that wondrous are
PSA.119.27	I shall to others show.
PSA.119.28	My soul doth melt, and drop away,
PSA.119.28	for heaviness and grief:
PSA.119.28	To me, according to thy word,
PSA.119.28	give strength, and send relief.
PSA.119.29	From me the wicked way of lies
PSA.119.29	let far removed be;
PSA.119.29	And graciously thy holy law
PSA.119.29	do thou grant unto me.
PSA.119.30	I chosen have the perfect way
PSA.119.30	of truth and verity:
PSA.119.30	Thy judgments that most righteous are
PSA.119.30	before me laid have I.
PSA.119.31	I to thy testimonies cleave;
PSA.119.31	shame do not on me cast.
PSA.119.32	I'll run thy precepts' way, when thou
PSA.119.32	my heart enlarged hast.
PSA.119.33	Teach me, O Lord, the perfect way
PSA.119.33	of thy precepts divine,
PSA.119.33	And to observe it to the end
PSA.119.33	I shall my heart incline.
PSA.119.34	Give understanding unto me,
PSA.119.34	so keep thy law shall I;
PSA.119.34	Yea, ev'n with my whole heart I shall
PSA.119.34	observe it carefully.
PSA.119.35	In thy law's path make me to go;
PSA.119.35	for I delight therein.
PSA.119.36	My heart unto thy testimonies,
PSA.119.36	and not to greed, incline.
PSA.119.37	Turn thou away my sight and eyes
PSA.119.37	from viewing vanity;
PSA.119.37	And in thy good and holy way
PSA.119.37	be pleas'd to quicken me.
PSA.119.38	Confirm to me thy gracious word,
PSA.119.38	which I did gladly hear,
PSA.119.38	Ev'n to thy servant, Lord, who is
PSA.119.38	devoted to thy fear.
PSA.119.39	Turn thou away my fear'd reproach;
PSA.119.39	for good thy judgments be.
PSA.119.40	Lo, for thy precepts I have long'd;
PSA.119.40	in thy truth quicken me.
PSA.119.41	Let thy sweet mercies also come
PSA.119.41	and visit me, O Lord;
PSA.119.41	Ev'n thy benign salvation,
PSA.119.41	according to thy word.
PSA.119.42	So shall I have wherewith I may
PSA.119.42	give him an answer just,
PSA.119.42	Who spitefully reproacheth me;
PSA.119.42	for in thy word I trust.
PSA.119.43	The word of truth out of my mouth
PSA.119.43	take thou not utterly;
PSA.119.43	For on thy judgments righteous
PSA.119.43	my hope doth still rely.
PSA.119.44	So shall I keep for evermore
PSA.119.44	thy law continually.
PSA.119.45	And, sith that I thy precepts seek,
PSA.119.45	I'll walk at liberty.
PSA.119.46	I'll speak thy word to kings,
PSA.119.46	and I with shame shall not be mov'd;
PSA.119.47	And will delight myself always
PSA.119.47	in thy laws, which I lov'd.
PSA.119.48	To thy commandments, which I lov'd,
PSA.119.48	my hands lift up I will;
PSA.119.48	And I will also meditate
PSA.119.48	upon thy statutes still.
PSA.119.49	Remember, Lord, thy gracious word
PSA.119.49	thou to thy servant spake,
PSA.119.49	Which, for a ground of my sure hope,
PSA.119.49	thou causedst me to take.
PSA.119.50	This word of thine my comfort is
PSA.119.50	in mine affliction:
PSA.119.50	For in my straits I am reviv'd
PSA.119.50	by this thy word alone.
PSA.119.51	The men whose hearts with pride are stuff'd
PSA.119.51	did greatly me deride;
PSA.119.51	Yet from thy straight commandements
PSA.119.51	I have not turn'd aside.
PSA.119.52	Thy judgments righteous, O Lord,
PSA.119.52	which thou of old forth gave,
PSA.119.52	I did remember, and myself
PSA.119.52	by them comforted have.
PSA.119.53	Horror took hold on me, because
PSA.119.53	ill men thy law forsake.
PSA.119.54	I in my house of pilgrimage
PSA.119.54	thy laws my songs do make.
PSA.119.55	Thy name by night, Lord, I did mind,
PSA.119.55	and I have kept thy law.
PSA.119.56	And this I had, because thy word
PSA.119.56	I kept, and stood in awe.
PSA.119.57	Thou my sure portion art alone,
PSA.119.57	which I did chuse, O Lord:
PSA.119.57	I have resolv'd, and said, that I
PSA.119.57	would keep thy holy word.
PSA.119.58	With my whole heart I did entreat
PSA.119.58	thy face and favour free:
PSA.119.58	According to thy gracious word
PSA.119.58	be merciful to me.
PSA.119.59	I thought upon my former ways,
PSA.119.59	and did my life well try;
PSA.119.59	And to thy testimonies pure
PSA.119.59	my feet then turned I.
PSA.119.60	I did not stay, nor linger long,
PSA.119.60	as those that slothful are;
PSA.119.60	But hastily thy laws to keep
PSA.119.60	myself I did prepare.
PSA.119.61	Bands of ill men me robb'd; yet I
PSA.119.61	thy precepts did not slight.
PSA.119.62	I'll rise at midnight thee to praise,
PSA.119.62	ev'n for thy judgments right.
PSA.119.63	I am companion to all those
PSA.119.63	who fear, and thee obey.
PSA.119.64	O Lord, thy mercy fills the earth:
PSA.119.64	teach me thy laws, I pray.
PSA.119.65	Well hast thou with thy servant dealt,
PSA.119.65	as thou didst promise give.
PSA.119.66	Good judgment me, and knowledge teach,
PSA.119.66	for I thy word believe.
PSA.119.67	Ere I afflicted was I stray'd;
PSA.119.67	but now I keep thy word.
PSA.119.68	Both good thou art, and good thou do'st:
PSA.119.68	teach me thy statutes, Lord.
PSA.119.69	The men that are puff 'd up with pride
PSA.119.69	against me forg'd a lie;
PSA.119.69	Yet thy commandements observe
PSA.119.69	with my whole heart will I.
PSA.119.70	Their hearts, through worldly ease and wealth,
PSA.119.70	as fat as grease they be:
PSA.119.70	But in thy holy law I take
PSA.119.70	delight continually.
PSA.119.71	It hath been very good for me
PSA.119.71	that I afflicted was,
PSA.119.71	That I might well instructed be,
PSA.119.71	and learn thy holy laws.
PSA.119.72	The word that cometh from thy mouth
PSA.119.72	is better unto me
PSA.119.72	Than many thousands and great sums
PSA.119.72	of gold and silver be.
PSA.119.73	Thou mad'st and fashion'dst me: thy laws
PSA.119.73	to know give wisdom, Lord.
PSA.119.74	So who thee fear shall joy to see
PSA.119.74	me trusting in thy word.
PSA.119.75	That very right thy judgments are
PSA.119.75	I know, and do confess;
PSA.119.75	And that thou hast afflicted me
PSA.119.75	in truth and faithfulness.
PSA.119.76	O let thy kindness merciful,
PSA.119.76	I pray thee, comfort me,
PSA.119.76	As to thy servant faithfully
PSA.119.76	was promised by thee.
PSA.119.77	And let thy tender mercies come
PSA.119.77	to me, that I may live;
PSA.119.77	Because thy holy laws to me
PSA.119.77	sweet delectation give.
PSA.119.78	Lord, let the proud ashamed be;
PSA.119.78	for they, without a cause,
PSA.119.78	With me perversely dealt: but I
PSA.119.78	will muse upon thy laws.
PSA.119.79	Let such as fear thee, and have known
PSA.119.79	thy statutes, turn to me.
PSA.119.80	My heart let in thy laws be sound,
PSA.119.80	that sham'd I never be.
PSA.119.81	My soul for thy salvation faints;
PSA.119.81	yet I thy word believe.
PSA.119.82	Mine eyes fail for thy word: I say,
PSA.119.82	When wilt thou comfort give?
PSA.119.83	For like a bottle I'm become,
PSA.119.83	that in the smoke is set:
PSA.119.83	I'm black, and parch'd with grief; yet I
PSA.119.83	thy statutes not forget.
PSA.119.84	How many are thy servant's days?
PSA.119.84	when wilt thou execute
PSA.119.84	Just judgment on these wicked men
PSA.119.84	that do me persecute?
PSA.119.85	The proud have digged pits for me,
PSA.119.85	which is against thy laws.
PSA.119.86	Thy words all faithful are: help me,
PSA.119.86	pursu'd without a cause.
PSA.119.87	They so consum'd me, that on earth
PSA.119.87	my life they scarce did leave:
PSA.119.87	Thy precepts yet forsook I not,
PSA.119.87	but close to them did cleave.
PSA.119.88	After thy loving-kindness, Lord,
PSA.119.88	me quicken, and preserve:
PSA.119.88	The testimony of thy mouth
PSA.119.88	so shall I still observe.
PSA.119.89	Thy word for ever is, O Lord,
PSA.119.89	in heaven settled fast;
PSA.119.90	Unto all generations
PSA.119.90	thy faithfulness doth last:
PSA.119.90	The earth thou hast established,
PSA.119.90	and it abides by thee.
PSA.119.91	This day they stand as thou ordain'dst;
PSA.119.91	for all thy servants be.
PSA.119.92	Unless in thy most perfect law
PSA.119.92	my soul delights had found,
PSA.119.92	I should have perished, when as
PSA.119.92	my troubles did abound.
PSA.119.93	Thy precepts I will ne'er forget;
PSA.119.93	they quick'ning to me brought.
PSA.119.94	Lord, I am thine; O save thou me:
PSA.119.94	thy precepts I have sought.
PSA.119.95	For me the wicked have laid wait,
PSA.119.95	me seeking to destroy:
PSA.119.95	But I thy testimonies true
PSA.119.95	consider will with joy.
PSA.119.96	An end of all perfection
PSA.119.96	here have I seen, O God:
PSA.119.96	But as for thy commandement,
PSA.119.96	it is exceeding broad.
PSA.119.97	O how love I thy law! it is
PSA.119.97	my study all the day:
PSA.119.98	It makes me wiser than my foes;
PSA.119.98	for it doth with me stay.
PSA.119.99	Than all my teachers now I have
PSA.119.99	more understanding far;
PSA.119.99	Because my meditation
PSA.119.99	thy testimonies are.
PSA.119.100	In understanding I excel
PSA.119.100	those that are ancients;
PSA.119.100	For I endeavoured to keep
PSA.119.100	all thy commandements.
PSA.119.101	My feet from each ill way I stay'd,
PSA.119.101	that I may keep thy word.
PSA.119.102	I from thy judgments have not swerv'd;
PSA.119.102	for thou hast taught me, Lord.
PSA.119.103	How sweet unto my taste, O Lord,
PSA.119.103	are all thy words of truth!
PSA.119.103	Yea, I do find them sweeter far
PSA.119.103	than honey to my mouth.
PSA.119.104	I through thy precepts, that are pure,
PSA.119.104	do understanding get;
PSA.119.104	I therefore ev'ry way that's false
PSA.119.104	with all my heart do hate.
PSA.119.105	Thy word is to my feet a lamp,
PSA.119.105	and to my path a light.
PSA.119.106	I sworn have, and I will perform,
PSA.119.106	to keep thy judgments right.
PSA.119.107	I am with sore affliction
PSA.119.107	ev'n overwhelm'd, O Lord:
PSA.119.107	In mercy raise and quicken me,
PSA.119.107	according to thy word.
PSA.119.108	The free-will-off 'rings of my mouth
PSA.119.108	accept, I thee beseech:
PSA.119.108	And unto me thy servant, Lord,
PSA.119.108	thy judgments clearly teach.
PSA.119.109	Though still my soul be in my hand,
PSA.119.109	thy laws I'll not forget.
PSA.119.110	I err'd not from them, though for me
PSA.119.110	the wicked snares did set.
PSA.119.111	I of thy testimonies have
PSA.119.111	above all things made choice,
PSA.119.111	To be my heritage for aye;
PSA.119.111	for they my heart rejoice.
PSA.119.112	I carefully inclined have
PSA.119.112	my heart still to attend;
PSA.119.112	That I thy statutes may perform
PSA.119.112	alway unto the end.
PSA.119.113	I hate the thoughts of vanity,
PSA.119.113	but love thy law do I.
PSA.119.114	My shield and hiding-place thou art:
PSA.119.114	I on thy word rely.
PSA.119.115	All ye that evil-doers are
PSA.119.115	from me depart away;
PSA.119.115	For the commandments of my God
PSA.119.115	I purpose to obey.
PSA.119.116	According to thy faithful word
PSA.119.116	uphold and stablish me,
PSA.119.116	That I may live, and of my hope
PSA.119.116	ashamed never be.
PSA.119.117	Hold thou me up, so shall I be
PSA.119.117	in peace and safety still;
PSA.119.117	And to thy statutes have respect
PSA.119.117	continually I will.
PSA.119.118	Thou tread'st down all that love to stray;
PSA.119.118	false their deceit doth prove.
PSA.119.119	Lewd men, like dross, away thou putt'st;
PSA.119.119	therefore thy law I love.
PSA.119.120	For fear of thee my very flesh
PSA.119.120	doth tremble, all dismay'd;
PSA.119.120	And of thy righteous judgments, Lord,
PSA.119.120	my soul is much afraid.
PSA.119.121	To all men I have judgment done,
PSA.119.121	performing justice right;
PSA.119.121	Then let me not be left unto my fierce oppressors' might.
PSA.119.122	For good unto thy servant, Lord,
PSA.119.122	thy servant's surety be:
PSA.119.122	From the oppression of the proud
PSA.119.122	do thou deliver me.
PSA.119.123	Mine eyes do fail with looking long
PSA.119.123	for thy salvation,
PSA.119.123	The word of thy pure righteousness
PSA.119.123	while I do wait upon.
PSA.119.124	In mercy with thy servant deal,
PSA.119.124	thy laws me teach and show.
PSA.119.125	I am thy servant, wisdom give,
PSA.119.125	that I thy laws may know.
PSA.119.126	'Tis time thou work, Lord; for they have
PSA.119.126	made void thy law divine.
PSA.119.127	Therefore thy precepts more I love
PSA.119.127	than gold, yea, gold most fine.
PSA.119.128	Concerning all things thy commands
PSA.119.128	all right I judge therefore;
PSA.119.128	And ev'ry false and wicked way
PSA.119.128	I perfectly abhor.
PSA.119.129	Thy statutes, Lord, are wonderful,
PSA.119.129	my soul them keeps with care.
PSA.119.130	The entrance of thy words gives light,
PSA.119.130	makes wise who simple are.
PSA.119.131	My mouth I have wide opened,
PSA.119.131	and panted earnestly,
PSA.119.131	While after thy commandements
PSA.119.131	I long'd exceedingly.
PSA.119.132	Look on me, Lord, and merciful
PSA.119.132	do thou unto me prove,
PSA.119.132	As thou art wont to do to those thy name who truly love.
PSA.119.133	O let my footsteps in thy word
PSA.119.133	aright still order'd be:
PSA.119.133	Let no iniquity obtain
PSA.119.133	dominion over me.
PSA.119.134	From man's oppression save thou me;
PSA.119.134	so keep thy laws I will.
PSA.119.135	Thy face make on thy servant shine;
PSA.119.135	teach me thy statutes still.
PSA.119.136	Rivers of waters from mine eyes
PSA.119.136	did run down, when I saw
PSA.119.136	How wicked men run on in sin,
PSA.119.136	and do not keep thy law.
PSA.119.137	O Lord, thou art most righteous;
PSA.119.137	thy judgments are upright.
PSA.119.138	Thy testimonies thou command'st
PSA.119.138	most faithful are and right.
PSA.119.139	My zeal hath ev'n consumed me,
PSA.119.139	because mine enemies
PSA.119.139	Thy holy words forgotten have,
PSA.119.139	and do thy laws despise.
PSA.119.140	Thy word's most pure, therefore on it
PSA.119.140	thy servant's love is set.
PSA.119.141	Small, and despis'd I am, yet I
PSA.119.141	thy precepts not forget.
PSA.119.142	Thy righteousness is righteousness
PSA.119.142	which ever doth endure:
PSA.119.142	Thy holy law, Lord, also is
PSA.119.142	the very truth most pure.
PSA.119.143	Trouble and anguish have me found,
PSA.119.143	and taken hold on me:
PSA.119.143	Yet in my trouble my delight
PSA.119.143	thy just commandments be.
PSA.119.144	Eternal righteousness is in
PSA.119.144	thy testimonies all:
PSA.119.144	Lord, to me understanding give,
PSA.119.144	and ever live I shall.
PSA.119.145	With my whole heart I cry'd, Lord, hear;
PSA.119.145	I will thy word obey.
PSA.119.146	I cry'd to thee; save me, and I
PSA.119.146	will keep thy laws alway.
PSA.119.147	I of the morning did prevent
PSA.119.147	the dawning, and did cry:
PSA.119.147	For all mine expectation
PSA.119.147	did on thy word rely.
PSA.119.148	Mine eyes did timeously prevent
PSA.119.148	the watches of the night,
PSA.119.148	That in thy word with careful mind
PSA.119.148	then meditate I might.
PSA.119.149	After thy loving-kindness hear
PSA.119.149	my voice, that calls on thee:
PSA.119.149	According to thy judgment, Lord,
PSA.119.149	revive and quicken me.
PSA.119.150	Who follow mischief they draw nigh;
PSA.119.150	they from thy law are far:
PSA.119.151	But thou art near, Lord; most firm truth
PSA.119.151	all thy commandments are.
PSA.119.152	As for thy testimonies all,
PSA.119.152	of old this have I try'd,
PSA.119.152	That thou hast surely founded them
PSA.119.152	for ever to abide.
PSA.119.153	Consider mine affliction,
PSA.119.153	in safety do me set:
PSA.119.153	Deliver me, O Lord, for I
PSA.119.153	thy law do not forget.
PSA.119.154	After thy word revive thou me: save me,
PSA.119.154	and plead my cause.
PSA.119.155	Salvation is from sinners far;
PSA.119.155	for they seek not thy laws.
PSA.119.156	O Lord, both great and manifold
PSA.119.156	thy tender mercies be:
PSA.119.156	According to thy judgments just,
PSA.119.156	revive and quicken me.
PSA.119.157	My persecutors many are,
PSA.119.157	and foes that do combine;
PSA.119.157	Yet from thy testimonies pure
PSA.119.157	my heart doth not decline.
PSA.119.158	I saw transgressors, and was griev'd;
PSA.119.158	for they keep not thy word.
PSA.119.159	See how I love thy law! as thou
PSA.119.159	art kind, me quicken, Lord.
PSA.119.160	From the beginning all thy word
PSA.119.160	hath been most true and sure:
PSA.119.160	Thy righteous judgments ev'ry one
PSA.119.160	for evermore endure.
PSA.119.161	Princes have persecuted me,
PSA.119.161	although no cause they saw:
PSA.119.161	But still of thy most holy word
PSA.119.161	my heart doth stand in awe.
PSA.119.162	I at thy word rejoice, as one
PSA.119.162	of spoil that finds great store.
PSA.119.163	Thy law I love; but lying all
PSA.119.163	I hate and do abhor.
PSA.119.164	Sev'n times a-day it is my care
PSA.119.164	to give due praise to thee;
PSA.119.164	Because of all thy judgments, Lord,
PSA.119.164	which righteous ever be.
PSA.119.165	Great peace have they who love thy law;
PSA.119.165	offence they shall have none.
PSA.119.166	I hop'd for thy salvation, Lord,
PSA.119.166	and thy commands have done.
PSA.119.167	My soul thy testimonies pure
PSA.119.167	observed carefully;
PSA.119.167	On them my heart is set, and them
PSA.119.167	I love exceedingly.
PSA.119.168	Thy testimonies and thy laws
PSA.119.168	I kept with special care;
PSA.119.168	For all my works and ways each one
PSA.119.168	before thee open are.
PSA.119.169	O let my earnest pray'r and cry
PSA.119.169	come near before thee, Lord:
PSA.119.169	Give understanding unto me,
PSA.119.169	according to thy word.
PSA.119.170	Let my request before thee come:
PSA.119.170	after thy word me free.
PSA.119.171	My lips shall utter praise, when thou
PSA.119.171	hast taught thy laws to me.
PSA.119.172	My tongue of thy most blessed word
PSA.119.172	shall speak, and it confess;
PSA.119.172	Because all thy commandements
PSA.119.172	are perfect righteousness.
PSA.119.173	Let thy strong hand make help to me:
PSA.119.173	thy precepts are my choice.
PSA.119.174	I long'd for thy salvation, Lord,
PSA.119.174	and in thy law rejoice.
PSA.119.175	O let my soul live, and it shall
PSA.119.175	give praises unto thee;
PSA.119.175	And let thy judgments gracious
PSA.119.175	be helpful unto me.
PSA.119.176	I, like a lost sheep, went astray;
PSA.119.176	thy servant seek, and find:
PSA.119.176	For thy commands I suffer'd not
PSA.119.176	to slip out of my mind.
PSA.120.1	In my distress to God I cry'd,
PSA.120.1	and he gave ear to me.
PSA.120.2	From lying lips, and guileful tongue,
PSA.120.2	O Lord, my soul set free.
PSA.120.3	What shall be giv'n thee? or what
PSA.120.3	shall be done to thee, false tongue?
PSA.120.4	Ev'n burning coals of juniper,
PSA.120.4	sharp arrows of the strong.
PSA.120.5	Woe's me that I in Mesech am
PSA.120.5	a sojourner so long;
PSA.120.5	That I in tabernacles dwell
PSA.120.5	to Kedar that belong.
PSA.120.6	My soul with him that hateth peace
PSA.120.6	hath long a dweller been.
PSA.120.7	I am for peace; but when I speak,
PSA.120.7	for battle they are keen.
PSA.121.1	I to the hills will lift mine eyes,
PSA.121.1	from whence doth come mine aid.
PSA.121.2	My safety cometh from the Lord,
PSA.121.2	who heav'n and earth hath made.
PSA.121.3	Thy foot he'll not let slide, nor will
PSA.121.3	he slumber that thee keeps.
PSA.121.4	Behold, he that keeps Israel,
PSA.121.4	he slumbers not, nor sleeps.
PSA.121.5	The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy shade
PSA.121.5	on thy right hand doth stay:
PSA.121.6	The moon by night thee shall not smite,
PSA.121.6	nor yet the sun by day.
PSA.121.7	The Lord shall keep thy soul; he shall
PSA.121.7	preserve thee from all ill.
PSA.121.8	Henceforth thy going out and in
PSA.121.8	God keep for ever will.
PSA.122.1	I joy'd when to the house of God,
PSA.122.1	Go up, they said to me.
PSA.122.2	Jerusalem, within thy gates
PSA.122.2	our feet shall standing be.
PSA.122.3	Jerus'lem, as a city, is
PSA.122.3	compactly built together:
PSA.122.4	Unto that place the tribes go up,
PSA.122.4	the tribes of God go thither:
PSA.122.4	To Isr'el's testimony, there
PSA.122.4	to God's name thanks to pay.
PSA.122.5	For thrones of judgment, ev'n the thrones
PSA.122.5	of David's house, there stay.
PSA.122.6	Pray that Jerusalem may have
PSA.122.6	peace and felicity:
PSA.122.6	Let them that love thee and thy peace
PSA.122.6	have still prosperity.
PSA.122.7	Therefore I wish that peace may still
PSA.122.7	within thy walls remain,
PSA.122.7	And ever may thy palaces
PSA.122.7	prosperity retain.
PSA.122.8	Now, for my friends' and brethren's sakes,
PSA.122.8	Peace be in thee, I'll say.
PSA.122.9	And for the house of God our Lord,
PSA.122.9	I'll seek thy good alway.
PSA.123.1	O thou that dwellest in the heav'ns,
PSA.123.1	I lift mine eyes to thee.
PSA.123.2	Behold, as servants' eyes do look
PSA.123.2	their masters' hand to see,
PSA.123.2	As handmaid's eyes her mistress' hand;
PSA.123.2	so do our eyes attend
PSA.123.2	Upon the Lord our God, until
PSA.123.2	to us he mercy send.
PSA.123.3	O Lord, be gracious to us,
PSA.123.3	unto us gracious be;
PSA.123.3	Because replenish'd with contempt
PSA.123.3	exceedingly are we.
PSA.123.4	Our soul is fill'd with scorn of those
PSA.123.4	that at their ease abide,
PSA.123.4	And with the insolent contempt
PSA.123.4	of those that swell in pride.
PSA.124.1	Had not the Lord been on our side,
PSA.124.1	may Israel now say;
PSA.124.2	Had not the Lord been on our side,
PSA.124.2	when men rose us to slay;
PSA.124.3	They had us swallow'd quick, when as
PSA.124.3	their wrath 'gainst us did flame:
PSA.124.4	Waters had cover'd us, our soul
PSA.124.4	had sunk beneath the stream.
PSA.124.5	Then had the waters, swelling high,
PSA.124.5	over our soul made way.
PSA.124.6	Bless'd be the Lord, who to their teeth
PSA.124.6	us gave not for a prey.
PSA.124.7	Our soul's escaped, as a bird
PSA.124.7	out of the fowler's snare;
PSA.124.7	The snare asunder broken is,
PSA.124.7	and we escaped are.
PSA.124.8	Our sure and all-sufficient help
PSA.124.8	is in 
PSA.124.8	His name who did the heav'n create,
PSA.124.8	and who the earth did frame.
PSA.125.1	They in the Lord that firmly trust
PSA.125.1	shall be like Sion hill,
PSA.125.1	Which at no time can be remov'd,
PSA.125.1	but standeth ever still.
PSA.125.2	As round about Jerusalem
PSA.125.2	the mountains stand alway,
PSA.125.2	The Lord his folk doth compass so,
PSA.125.2	from henceforth and for aye.
PSA.125.3	For ill men's rod upon the lot
PSA.125.3	of just men shall not lie;
PSA.125.3	Lest righteous men stretch
PSA.125.3	forth their hands unto iniquity.
PSA.125.4	Do thou to all those that be good
PSA.125.4	thy goodness, Lord, impart;
PSA.125.4	And do thou good to those that are
PSA.125.4	upright within their heart.
PSA.125.5	But as for such as turn aside
PSA.125.5	after their crooked way,
PSA.125.5	God shall lead forth with wicked men:
PSA.125.5	on Isr'el peace shall stay.
PSA.126.1	When Sion's bondage God turn'd back,
PSA.126.1	as men that dream'd were we.
PSA.126.2	Then fill'd with laughter was our mouth,
PSA.126.2	our tongue with melody:
PSA.126.2	They 'mong the heathen said, The Lord
PSA.126.2	great things for them hath wrought.
PSA.126.3	The Lord hath done great things for us,
PSA.126.3	whence joy to us is brought.
PSA.126.4	As streams of water in the south,
PSA.126.4	our bondage, Lord, recall.
PSA.126.5	Who sow in tears, a reaping time
PSA.126.5	of joy enjoy they shall.
PSA.126.6	That man who, bearing precious seed,
PSA.126.6	in going forth doth mourn,
PSA.126.6	He doubtless, bringing back his sheaves,
PSA.126.6	rejoicing shall return.
PSA.127.1	Except the Lord do build the house,
PSA.127.1	the builders lose their pain:
PSA.127.1	Except the Lord the city keep,
PSA.127.1	the watchmen watch in vain.
PSA.127.2	'Tis vain for you to rise betimes,
PSA.127.2	or late from rest to keep,
PSA.127.2	To feed on sorrows' bread;
PSA.127.2	so gives he his beloved sleep.
PSA.127.3	Lo, children are God's heritage,
PSA.127.3	the womb's fruit his reward.
PSA.127.4	The sons of youth as arrows are,
PSA.127.4	for strong men's hands prepar'd.
PSA.127.5	O happy is the man that hath
PSA.127.5	his quiver fill'd with those;
PSA.127.5	They unashamed in the gate
PSA.127.5	shall speak unto their foes.
PSA.128.1	Bless'd is each one that fears the Lord,
PSA.128.1	and walketh in his ways;
PSA.128.2	For of thy labour thou shalt eat,
PSA.128.2	and happy be always.
PSA.128.3	Thy wife shall as a fruitful vine
PSA.128.3	by thy house' sides be found:
PSA.128.3	Thy children like to olive-plants
PSA.128.3	about thy table round.
PSA.128.4	Behold, the man that fears the Lord,
PSA.128.4	thus blessed shall he be.
PSA.128.5	The Lord shall out of Sion give
PSA.128.5	his blessing unto thee:
PSA.128.5	Thou shalt Jerus'lem's good behold
PSA.128.5	whilst thou on earth dost dwell.
PSA.128.6	Thou shalt thy children's children see,
PSA.128.6	and peace on Israel.
PSA.129.1	Oft did they vex me from my youth,
PSA.129.1	may Isr'el now declare;
PSA.129.2	Oft did they vex me from my youth,
PSA.129.2	yet not victorious were.
PSA.129.3	The plowers plow'd upon my back;
PSA.129.3	they long their furrows drew.
PSA.129.4	The righteous Lord did cut the cords
PSA.129.4	of the ungodly crew.
PSA.129.5	Let Sion's haters all be turn'd
PSA.129.5	back with confusion.
PSA.129.6	As grass on houses' tops be they,
PSA.129.6	which fades ere it be grown:
PSA.129.7	Whereof enough to fill his hand
PSA.129.7	the mower cannot find;
PSA.129.7	Nor can the man his bosom fill,
PSA.129.7	whose work is sheaves to bind.
PSA.129.8	Neither say they who do go by,
PSA.129.8	God's blessing on you rest:
PSA.129.8	We in the name of God
PSA.129.8	the Lord do wish you to be blest.
PSA.130.1	Lord, from the depths to thee I cry'd.
PSA.130.2	My voice, Lord, do thou hear:
PSA.130.2	Unto my supplication's voice
PSA.130.2	give an attentive ear.
PSA.130.3	Lord, who shall stand, if thou, O Lord,
PSA.130.3	should'st mark iniquity?
PSA.130.4	But yet with thee forgiveness is,
PSA.130.4	that fear'd thou mayest be.
PSA.130.5	I wait for God, my soul doth wait,
PSA.130.5	my hope is in his word.
PSA.130.6	More than they that for morning watch,
PSA.130.6	my soul waits for the Lord;
PSA.130.6	I say, more than they that do watch
PSA.130.6	the morning light to see.
PSA.130.7	Let Israel hope in the Lord,
PSA.130.7	for with him mercies be;
PSA.130.7	And plenteous redemption
PSA.130.7	is ever found with him.
PSA.130.8	And from all his iniquities
PSA.130.8	he Isr'el shall redeem.
PSA.131.1	My heart not haughty is, O Lord,
PSA.131.1	mine eyes not lofty be;
PSA.131.1	Nor do I deal in matters great,
PSA.131.1	or things too high for me.
PSA.131.2	I surely have myself behav'd
PSA.131.2	with quiet sp'rit and mild,
PSA.131.2	As child of mother wean'd: my soul
PSA.131.2	is like a weaned child.
PSA.131.3	Upon the Lord let all the hope
PSA.131.3	of Israel rely,
PSA.131.3	Ev'n from the time that present is
PSA.131.3	unto eternity.
PSA.132.1	David, and his afflictions all,
PSA.132.1	Lord, do thou think upon;
PSA.132.2	How unto God he sware,
PSA.132.2	and vow'd to Jacob's mighty One.
PSA.132.3	I will not come within my house,
PSA.132.3	nor rest in bed at all;
PSA.132.4	Nor shall mine eyes take any sleep,
PSA.132.4	nor eyelids slumber shall;
PSA.132.5	Till for the Lord a place I find,
PSA.132.5	where he may make abode;
PSA.132.5	A place of habitation
PSA.132.5	for Jacob's mighty God.
PSA.132.6	Lo, at the place of Ephratah
PSA.132.6	of it we understood;
PSA.132.6	And we did find it in the fields,
PSA.132.6	and city of the wood.
PSA.132.7	We'll go into his tabernacles,
PSA.132.7	and at his footstool bow.
PSA.132.8	Arise, O Lord, into thy rest,
PSA.132.8	th' ark of thy strength, and thou.
PSA.132.9	O let thy priests be clothed, Lord,
PSA.132.9	with truth and righteousness;
PSA.132.9	And let all those that are thy saints
PSA.132.9	shout loud for joyfulness.
PSA.132.10	For thine own servant David's sake,
PSA.132.10	do not deny thy grace;
PSA.132.10	Nor of thine own anointed one
PSA.132.10	turn thou away the face.
PSA.132.11	The Lord in truth to David sware,
PSA.132.11	he will not turn from it,
PSA.132.11	I of thy body's fruit will make
PSA.132.11	upon thy throne to sit.
PSA.132.12	My cov'nant if thy sons will keep,
PSA.132.12	and laws to them made known,
PSA.132.12	Their children then shall also sit
PSA.132.12	for ever on thy throne.
PSA.132.13	For God of Sion hath made choice;
PSA.132.13	there he desires to dwell.
PSA.132.14	This is my rest, here still I'll stay;
PSA.132.14	for I do like it well.
PSA.132.15	Her food I'll greatly bless; her poor
PSA.132.15	with bread will satisfy.
PSA.132.16	Her priests I'll clothe with health; her saints
PSA.132.16	shall shout forth joyfully.
PSA.132.17	And there will I make David's horn
PSA.132.17	to bud forth pleasantly:
PSA.132.17	For him that mine anointed is
PSA.132.17	a lamp ordain'd have I.
PSA.132.18	As with a garment I will clothe
PSA.132.18	with shame his en'mies all:
PSA.132.18	But yet the crown that he doth wear
PSA.132.18	upon him flourish shall.
PSA.133.1	Behold, how good a thing it is,
PSA.133.1	and how becoming well,
PSA.133.1	Together such as brethren are
PSA.133.1	in unity to dwell!
PSA.133.2	Like precious ointment on the head,
PSA.133.2	that down the beard did flow,
PSA.133.2	Ev'n Aaron's beard, and to the skirts,
PSA.133.2	did of his garments go.
PSA.133.3	As Hermon's dew, the dew that doth
PSA.133.3	on Sion' hills descend:
PSA.133.3	For there the blessing God commands,
PSA.133.3	life that shall never end.
PSA.134.1	Behold, bless ye the Lord, all ye
PSA.134.1	that his attendants are,
PSA.134.1	Ev'n you that in God's temple be,
PSA.134.1	and praise him nightly there.
PSA.134.2	Your hands within God's holy place
PSA.134.2	lift up, and praise his name.
PSA.134.3	From Sion' hill the Lord thee bless,
PSA.134.3	that heav'n and earth did frame.
PSA.135.1	Praise ye the Lord, the Lord's name praise;
PSA.135.1	his servants, praise ye God.
PSA.135.2	Who stand in God's house, in the courts
PSA.135.2	of our God make abode.
PSA.135.3	Praise ye the Lord, for he is good;
PSA.135.3	unto him praises sing:
PSA.135.3	Sing praises to his name, because
PSA.135.3	it is a pleasant thing.
PSA.135.4	For Jacob to himself the Lord
PSA.135.4	did chuse of his good pleasure,
PSA.135.4	And he hath chosen Israel
PSA.135.4	for his peculiar treasure.
PSA.135.5	Because I know assuredly
PSA.135.5	the Lord is very great,
PSA.135.5	And that our Lord above all gods
PSA.135.5	in glory hath his seat.
PSA.135.6	What things soever pleas'd the Lord,
PSA.135.6	that in the heav'n did he,
PSA.135.6	And in the earth, the seas,
PSA.135.6	and all the places deep that be.
PSA.135.7	He from the ends of earth doth make
PSA.135.7	the vapours to ascend;
PSA.135.7	With rain he lightnings makes, and wind
PSA.135.7	doth from his treasures send.
PSA.135.8	Egypt's first-born, from man to beast
PSA.135.9	who smote. Strange tokens he
PSA.135.9	On Phar'oh and his servants sent,
PSA.135.9	Egypt, in midst of thee.
PSA.135.10	He smote great nations, slew great kings:
PSA.135.11	Sihon of Heshbon king,
PSA.135.11	And Og of Bashan, and to nought
PSA.135.11	did Canaan's kingdoms bring:
PSA.135.12	And for a wealthy heritage
PSA.135.12	their pleasant land he gave,
PSA.135.12	An heritage which Israel,
PSA.135.12	his chosen folk, should have.
PSA.135.13	Thy name, O Lord, shall still endure,
PSA.135.13	and thy memorial
PSA.135.13	With honour shall continu'd be
PSA.135.13	to generations all.
PSA.135.14	For why? the righteous God will judge
PSA.135.14	his people righteously;
PSA.135.14	Concerning those that do him serve,
PSA.135.14	himself repent will he.
PSA.135.15	The idols of the nations
PSA.135.15	of silver are and gold,
PSA.135.15	And by the hands of men is made
PSA.135.15	their fashion and mould.
PSA.135.16	Mouths have they, but they do not speak;
PSA.135.16	eyes, but they do not see;
PSA.135.17	Ears have they, but hear not; and in
PSA.135.17	their mouths no breathing be.
PSA.135.18	Their makers are like them; so are
PSA.135.18	all that on them rely.
PSA.135.19	O Isr'el's house, bless God; bless God,
PSA.135.19	O Aaron's family.
PSA.135.20	O bless the Lord, of Levi's house
PSA.135.20	ye who his servants are;
PSA.135.20	And bless the holy name of God,
PSA.135.20	all ye the Lord that fear.
PSA.135.21	And blessed be the Lord our God
PSA.135.21	from Sion's holy hill,
PSA.135.21	Who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
PSA.135.21	The Lord O praise ye still.
PSA.136.1	Give thanks to God, for good is he:
PSA.136.1	for mercy hath he ever.
PSA.136.2	Thanks to the God of gods give ye:
PSA.136.2	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.3	Thanks give the Lord of lords unto:
PSA.136.3	for mercy hath he ever.
PSA.136.4	Who only wonders great can do:
PSA.136.4	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.5	Who by his wisdom made heav'ns high:
PSA.136.5	for mercy hath he ever.
PSA.136.6	Who stretch'd the earth above the sea:
PSA.136.6	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.7	To him that made the great lights shine:
PSA.136.7	for mercy hath he ever.
PSA.136.8	The sun to rule till day decline:
PSA.136.8	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.9	The moon and stars to rule by night:
PSA.136.9	for mercy hath he ever.
PSA.136.10	Who Egypt's first-born kill'd outright:
PSA.136.10	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.11	And Isr'el brought from Egypt land:
PSA.136.11	for mercy hath he ever.
PSA.136.12	With stretch'd-out arm, and with strong hand:
PSA.136.12	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.13	By whom the Red sea parted was:
PSA.136.13	for mercy hath he ever.
PSA.136.14	And through its midst made Isr'el pass:
PSA.136.14	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.15	But Phar'oh and his host did drown:
PSA.136.15	for mercy hath he ever.
PSA.136.16	Who through the desert led his own:
PSA.136.16	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.17	To him great kings who overthrew:
PSA.136.17	for he hath mercy ever.
PSA.136.18	Yea, famous kings in battle slew:
PSA.136.18	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.19	Ev'n Sihon king of Amorites:
PSA.136.19	for he hath mercy ever.
PSA.136.20	And Og the king of Bashanites:
PSA.136.20	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.21	Their land in heritage to have:
PSA.136.21	(for mercy hath he ever.)
PSA.136.22	His servant Isr'el right he gave:
PSA.136.22	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.23	In our low state who on us thought:
PSA.136.23	for he hath mercy ever.
PSA.136.24	And from our foes our freedom wrought:
PSA.136.24	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.136.25	Who doth all flesh with food relieve:
PSA.136.25	for he hath mercy ever.
PSA.136.26	Thanks to the God of heaven give:
PSA.136.26	for his grace faileth never.
PSA.137.1	By Babel's streams we sat and wept,
PSA.137.1	when Sion we thought on.
PSA.137.2	In midst thereof we hang'd our harps
PSA.137.2	the willow-trees upon.
PSA.137.3	For there a song required they,
PSA.137.3	who did us captive bring:
PSA.137.3	Our spoilers call'd for mirth, and said,
PSA.137.3	A song of Sion sing.
PSA.137.4	O how the Lord's song shall we sing
PSA.137.4	within a foreign land?
PSA.137.5	If thee, Jerus'lem, I forget,
PSA.137.5	skill part from my right hand.
PSA.137.6	My tongue to my mouth's roof let cleave,
PSA.137.6	if I do thee forget,
PSA.137.6	Jerusalem, and thee above
PSA.137.6	my chief joy do not set.
PSA.137.7	Remember Edom's children, Lord,
PSA.137.7	who in Jerus'lems day,
PSA.137.7	Ev'n unto its foundation,
PSA.137.7	Raze, raze it quite, did say.
PSA.137.8	O daughter thou of Babylon,
PSA.137.8	near to destruction;
PSA.137.8	Bless'd shall he be that thee rewards,
PSA.137.8	as thou to us hast done.
PSA.137.9	Yea, happy surely shall he be
PSA.137.9	thy tender little ones
PSA.137.9	Who shall lay hold upon,
PSA.137.9	and them shall dash against the stones.
PSA.138.1	Thee will I praise with all my heart,
PSA.138.1	I will sing praise to thee
PSA.138.2	Before the gods: And worship will
PSA.138.2	toward thy sanctuary.
PSA.138.2	I'll praise thy name, ev'n for thy truth,
PSA.138.2	and kindness of thy love;
PSA.138.2	For thou thy word hast magnify'd
PSA.138.2	all thy great name above.
PSA.138.3	Thou didst me answer in the day
PSA.138.3	when I to thee did cry;
PSA.138.3	And thou my fainting soul with strength
PSA.138.3	didst strengthen inwardly.
PSA.138.4	All kings upon the earth that are
PSA.138.4	shall give thee praise, O Lord,
PSA.138.4	When as they from thy mouth shall hear
PSA.138.4	thy true and faithful word.
PSA.138.5	Yea, in the righteous ways of God
PSA.138.5	with gladness they shall sing:
PSA.138.5	For great's the glory of the Lord;
PSA.138.5	who doth for ever reign.
PSA.138.6	Though God be high, yet he respects
PSA.138.6	all those that lowly be;
PSA.138.6	Whereas the proud and lofty ones
PSA.138.6	afar off knoweth he.
PSA.138.7	Though I in midst of trouble walk,
PSA.138.7	I life from thee shall have:
PSA.138.7	'Gainst my foes' wrath thou'lt stretch thine hand;
PSA.138.7	thy right hand shall me save.
PSA.138.8	Surely that which concerneth me
PSA.138.8	the Lord will perfect make:
PSA.138.8	Lord, still thy mercy lasts; do not
PSA.138.8	thine own hands' works forsake.
PSA.139.1	O Lord, thou hast me search'd and known.
PSA.139.2	Thou know'st my sitting down,
PSA.139.2	And rising up; yea, all my thoughts
PSA.139.2	afar to thee are known.
PSA.139.3	My footsteps, and my lying down,
PSA.139.3	thou compassest always;
PSA.139.3	Thou also most entirely art
PSA.139.3	acquaint with all my ways.
PSA.139.4	For in my tongue, before I speak,
PSA.139.4	not any word can be,
PSA.139.4	But altogether, lo, O Lord,
PSA.139.4	it is well known to thee.
PSA.139.5	Behind, before, thou hast beset,
PSA.139.5	and laid on me thine hand.
PSA.139.6	Such knowledge is too strange for me,
PSA.139.6	too high to understand.
PSA.139.7	From thy Sp'rit whither shall I go?
PSA.139.7	or from thy presence fly?
PSA.139.8	Ascend I heav'n, lo, thou art there;
PSA.139.8	there, if in hell I lie.
PSA.139.9	Take I the morning wings, and dwell
PSA.139.9	in utmost parts of sea;
PSA.139.10	Ev'n there, Lord, shall thy hand me lead,
PSA.139.10	thy right hand hold shall me.
PSA.139.11	If I do say that darkness shall
PSA.139.11	me cover from thy sight,
PSA.139.11	Then surely shall the very night
PSA.139.11	about me be as light.
PSA.139.12	Yea, darkness hideth not from thee,
PSA.139.12	but night doth shine as day:
PSA.139.12	To thee the darkness and the light
PSA.139.12	are both alike alway.
PSA.139.13	For thou possessed hast my reins,
PSA.139.13	and thou hast cover'd me,
PSA.139.13	When I within my mother's womb
PSA.139.13	inclosed was by thee.
PSA.139.14	Thee will I praise; for fearfully
PSA.139.14	and strangely made I am;
PSA.139.14	Thy works are marv'llous, and right well
PSA.139.14	my soul doth know the same.
PSA.139.15	My substance was not hid from thee,
PSA.139.15	when as in secret I
PSA.139.15	Was made; and in earth's lowest parts
PSA.139.15	was wrought most curiously.
PSA.139.16	Thine eyes my substance did behold,
PSA.139.16	yet being unperfect;
PSA.139.16	And in the volume of thy book
PSA.139.16	my members all were writ;
PSA.139.16	Which after in continuance
PSA.139.16	were fashion'd ev'ry one,
PSA.139.16	When as they yet all shapeless were,
PSA.139.16	and of them there was none.
PSA.139.17	How precious also are thy thoughts,
PSA.139.17	O gracious God, to me!
PSA.139.17	And in their sum how passing great
PSA.139.17	and numberless they be!
PSA.139.18	If I should count them, than the sand
PSA.139.18	they more in number be:
PSA.139.18	What time soever I awake,
PSA.139.18	I ever am with thee.
PSA.139.19	Thou, Lord, wilt sure the wicked slay:
PSA.139.19	hence from me bloody men.
PSA.139.20	Thy foes against thee loudly speak,
PSA.139.20	and take thy name in vain.
PSA.139.21	Do not I hate all those, O Lord,
PSA.139.21	that hatred bear to thee?
PSA.139.21	With those that up against thee rise
PSA.139.21	can I but grieved be?
PSA.139.22	With perfect hatred them I hate,
PSA.139.22	my foes I them do hold.
PSA.139.23	Search me, O God, and know my heart,
PSA.139.23	try me, my thoughts unfold:
PSA.139.24	And see if any wicked way
PSA.139.24	there be at all in me;
PSA.139.24	And in thine everlasting way
PSA.139.24	to me a leader be.
PSA.140.1	Lord, from the ill and froward man
PSA.140.1	give me deliverance,
PSA.140.1	And do thou safe preserve me from
PSA.140.1	the man of violence:
PSA.140.2	Who in their heart mischievous things
PSA.140.2	are meditating ever;
PSA.140.2	And they for war assembled are
PSA.140.2	continually together.
PSA.140.3	Much like unto a serpent's tongue
PSA.140.3	their tongues they sharp do make;
PSA.140.3	And underneath their lips there lies
PSA.140.3	the poison of a snake.
PSA.140.4	Lord, keep me from the wicked's hands,
PSA.140.4	from vi'lent men me save;
PSA.140.4	Who utterly to overthrow
PSA.140.4	my goings purpos'd have.
PSA.140.5	The proud for me a snare have hid,
PSA.140.5	and cords; yea, they a net
PSA.140.5	Have by the way-side for me spread;
PSA.140.5	they gins for me have set.
PSA.140.6	I said unto the Lord, Thou art
PSA.140.6	my God: unto the cry
PSA.140.6	Of all my supplications,
PSA.140.6	Lord, do thine ear apply.
PSA.140.7	O God the Lord, who art the strength
PSA.140.7	of my salvation:
PSA.140.7	A cov'ring in the day of war
PSA.140.7	my head thou hast put on.
PSA.140.8	Unto the wicked man, O Lord,
PSA.140.8	his wishes do not grant;
PSA.140.8	Nor further thou his ill device,
PSA.140.8	lest they themselves should vaunt.
PSA.140.9	As for the head and chief of those
PSA.140.9	about that compass me,
PSA.140.9	Ev'n by the mischief of their lips
PSA.140.9	let thou them cover'd be.
PSA.140.10	Let burning coals upon them fall,
PSA.140.10	them throw in fiery flame,
PSA.140.10	And in deep pits, that they no more
PSA.140.10	may rise out of the same.
PSA.140.11	Let not an evil speaker be
PSA.140.11	on earth established:
PSA.140.11	Mischief shall hunt the vi'lent man,
PSA.140.11	till he be ruined.
PSA.140.12	I know God will th' afflicted's cause
PSA.140.12	maintain, and poor men's right.
PSA.140.13	Surely the just shall praise thy name;
PSA.140.13	th' upright dwell in thy sight.
PSA.141.1	O Lord, I unto thee do cry,
PSA.141.1	do thou make haste to me,
PSA.141.1	And give an ear unto my voice,
PSA.141.1	when I cry unto thee.
PSA.141.2	As incense let my prayer be
PSA.141.2	directed in thine eyes;
PSA.141.2	And the uplifting of my hands
PSA.141.2	as th' ev 'ning sacrifice.
PSA.141.3	Set, Lord, a watch before my mouth,
PSA.141.3	keep of my lips the door.
PSA.141.4	My heart incline thou not unto
PSA.141.4	the ills I should abhor,
PSA.141.4	To practise wicked works with men
PSA.141.4	that work iniquity;
PSA.141.4	And with their delicates my taste
PSA.141.4	let me not satisfy.
PSA.141.5	Let him that righteous is me smite,
PSA.141.5	it shall a kindness be;
PSA.141.5	Let him reprove, I shall it count
PSA.141.5	a precious oil to me:
PSA.141.5	Such smiting shall not break my head;
PSA.141.5	for yet the time shall fall,
PSA.141.5	When I in their calamities
PSA.141.5	to God pray for them shall.
PSA.141.6	When as their judges down shall be
PSA.141.6	in stony places cast,
PSA.141.6	Then shall they hear my words; for they
PSA.141.6	shall sweet be to their taste.
PSA.141.7	About the grave's devouring mouth
PSA.141.7	our bones are scatter'd round,
PSA.141.7	As wood which men do cut and cleave
PSA.141.7	lies scatter'd on the ground.
PSA.141.8	But unto thee, O God the Lord,
PSA.141.8	mine eyes uplifted be:
PSA.141.8	My soul do not leave destitute;
PSA.141.8	my trust is set on thee.
PSA.141.9	Lord, keep me safely from the snares
PSA.141.9	which they for me prepare;
PSA.141.9	And from the subtile gins of them
PSA.141.9	that wicked workers are.
PSA.141.10	Let workers of iniquity
PSA.141.10	into their own nets fall,
PSA.141.10	Whilst I do, by thine help, escape
PSA.141.10	the danger of them all.
PSA.142.1	I with my voice cry'd to the Lord,
PSA.142.1	with it made my request:
PSA.142.2	Pour'd out to him my plaint, to him
PSA.142.2	my trouble I exprest.
PSA.142.3	When in me was o'erwhelm'd my sp'rit,
PSA.142.3	then well thou knew'st my way;
PSA.142.3	Where I did walk a snare for me
PSA.142.3	they privily did lay.
PSA.142.4	I look'd on my right hand, and view'd,
PSA.142.4	but none to know me were;
PSA.142.4	All refuge failed me, no man
PSA.142.4	did for my soul take care.
PSA.142.5	I cry'd to thee; I said, Thou art
PSA.142.5	my refuge, Lord, alone;
PSA.142.5	And in the land of those that live
PSA.142.5	thou art my portion.
PSA.142.6	Because I am brought very low,
PSA.142.6	attend unto my cry:
PSA.142.6	Me from my persecutors save,
PSA.142.6	who stronger are than I.
PSA.142.7	From prison bring my soul, that I
PSA.142.7	thy name may glorify:
PSA.142.7	The just shall compass me, when thou
PSA.142.7	with me deal'st bounteously.
PSA.143.1	Lord, hear my pray'r, attend my suits;
PSA.143.1	and in thy faithfulness
PSA.143.1	Give thou an answer unto me,
PSA.143.1	and in thy righteousness.
PSA.143.2	Thy servant also bring thou not
PSA.143.2	in judgment to be try'd:
PSA.143.2	Because no living man can be
PSA.143.2	in thy sight justify'd.
PSA.143.3	For th' en'my hath pursu'd my soul,
PSA.143.3	my life to ground down tread:
PSA.143.3	In darkness he hath made me dwell,
PSA.143.3	as who have long been dead.
PSA.143.4	My sp'rit is therefore overwhelm'd
PSA.143.4	in me perplexedly;
PSA.143.4	Within me is my very heart
PSA.143.4	amazed wondrously.
PSA.143.5	I call to mind the days of old,
PSA.143.5	to meditate I use
PSA.143.5	On all thy works; upon the deeds
PSA.143.5	I of thy hands do muse.
PSA.143.6	My hands to thee I stretch; my soul
PSA.143.6	thirsts, as dry land, for thee.
PSA.143.7	Haste, Lord, to hear, my spirit fails:
PSA.143.7	hide not thy face from me;
PSA.143.7	Lest like to them I do become
PSA.143.7	that go down to the dust.
PSA.143.8	At morn let me thy kindness hear;
PSA.143.8	for in thee do I trust.
PSA.143.8	Teach me the way that I should walk:
PSA.143.8	I lift my soul to thee.
PSA.143.9	Lord, free me from my foes; I flee
PSA.143.9	to thee to cover me.
PSA.143.10	Because thou art my God, to do
PSA.143.10	thy will do me instruct:
PSA.143.10	Thy Sp'rit is good, me to the land
PSA.143.10	of uprightness conduct.
PSA.143.11	Revive and quicken me, O Lord,
PSA.143.11	ev'n for thine own name's sake;
PSA.143.11	And do thou, for thy righteousness,
PSA.143.11	my soul from trouble take.
PSA.143.12	And of thy mercy slay my foes;
PSA.143.12	let all destroyed be
PSA.143.12	That do afflict my soul: for I
PSA.143.12	a servant am to thee.
PSA.144.1	O blessed ever be the Lord,
PSA.144.1	who is my strength and might,
PSA.144.1	Who doth instruct my hands to war,
PSA.144.1	my fingers teach to fight.
PSA.144.2	My goodness, fortress, my high tow'r,
PSA.144.2	deliverer, and shield,
PSA.144.2	In whom I trust: who under me
PSA.144.2	my people makes to yield.
PSA.144.3	Lord, what is man, that thou of him
PSA.144.3	dost so much knowledge take?
PSA.144.3	Or son of man, that thou of him
PSA.144.3	so great account dost make?
PSA.144.4	Man is like vanity; his days,
PSA.144.4	as shadows, pass away.
PSA.144.5	Lord, bow thy heav'ns, come down, touch thou
PSA.144.5	the hills, and smoke shall they.
PSA.144.6	Cast forth thy lightning, scatter them;
PSA.144.6	thine arrows shoot, them rout.
PSA.144.7	Thine hand send from above, me save;
PSA.144.7	from great depths draw me out;
PSA.144.7	And from the hand of children strange,
PSA.144.8	Whose mouth speaks vanity;
PSA.144.8	And their right hand is a right hand
PSA.144.8	that works deceitfully.
PSA.144.9	A new song I to thee will sing,
PSA.144.9	Lord, on a psaltery;
PSA.144.9	I on a ten-string'd instrument
PSA.144.9	will praises sing to thee.
PSA.144.10	Ev'n he it is that unto kings
PSA.144.10	salvation doth send;
PSA.144.10	Who his own servant David doth
PSA.144.10	from hurtful sword defend.
PSA.144.11	O free me from strange children's hand,
PSA.144.11	whose mouth speaks vanity;
PSA.144.11	And their right hand a right hand is
PSA.144.11	that works deceitfully.
PSA.144.12	That, as the plants, our sons may be
PSA.144.12	in youth grown up that are;
PSA.144.12	Our daughters like to corner-stones,
PSA.144.12	carv'd like a palace fair.
PSA.144.13	That to afford all kind of store
PSA.144.13	our garners may be fill'd;
PSA.144.13	That our sheep thousands, in our streets
PSA.144.13	ten thousands they may yield.
PSA.144.14	That strong our oxen be for work,
PSA.144.14	that no in-breaking be,
PSA.144.14	Nor going out; and that our streets
PSA.144.14	may from complaints be free.
PSA.144.15	Those people blessed are who be
PSA.144.15	in such a case as this;
PSA.144.15	Yea, blessed all those people are,
PSA.144.15	whose God 
PSA.145.1	I'll thee extol, my God, O King;
PSA.145.1	I'll bless thy name always.
PSA.145.2	Thee will I bless each day, and will
PSA.145.2	thy name for ever praise.
PSA.145.3	Great is the Lord, much to be prais'd;
PSA.145.3	his greatness search exceeds.
PSA.145.4	Race unto race shall praise thy works,
PSA.145.4	and shew thy mighty deeds.
PSA.145.5	I of thy glorious majesty
PSA.145.5	the honour will record;
PSA.145.5	I'll speak of all thy mighty works,
PSA.145.5	which wondrous are, O Lord.
PSA.145.6	Men of thine acts the might shall show,
PSA.145.6	thine acts that dreadful are;
PSA.145.6	And I, thy glory to advance,
PSA.145.6	thy greatness will declare.
PSA.145.7	The mem'ry of thy goodness great
PSA.145.7	they largely shall express;
PSA.145.7	With songs of praise they shall extol
PSA.145.7	thy perfect righteousness.
PSA.145.8	The Lord is very gracious,
PSA.145.8	in him compassions flow;
PSA.145.8	In mercy he is very great,
PSA.145.8	and is to anger slow.
PSA.145.9	The Lord 
PSA.145.9	his goodness doth declare;
PSA.145.9	And over all his other works
PSA.145.9	his tender mercies are.
PSA.145.10	Thee all thy works shall praise, O Lord,
PSA.145.10	and thee thy saints shall bless;
PSA.145.11	They shall thy kingdom's glory show,
PSA.145.11	thy pow'r by speech express:
PSA.145.12	To make the sons of men to know
PSA.145.12	his acts done mightily,
PSA.145.12	And of his kingdom th' excellent
PSA.145.12	and glorious majesty.
PSA.145.13	Thy kingdom shall for ever stand,
PSA.145.13	thy reign through ages all.
PSA.145.14	God raiseth all that are bow'd down,
PSA.145.14	upholdeth all that fall.
PSA.145.15	The eyes of all things wait on thee,
PSA.145.15	the giver of all good;
PSA.145.15	And thou, in time convenient,
PSA.145.15	bestow'st on them their food:
PSA.145.16	Thine hand thou open'st lib'rally,
PSA.145.16	and of thy bounty gives
PSA.145.16	Enough to satisfy the need
PSA.145.16	of ev'ry thing that lives.
PSA.145.17	The Lord is just in all his ways,
PSA.145.17	holy in his works all.
PSA.145.18	God's near to all that call on him,
PSA.145.18	in truth that on him call.
PSA.145.19	He will accomplish the desire
PSA.145.19	of those that do him fear:
PSA.145.19	He also will deliver them,
PSA.145.19	and he their cry will hear.
PSA.145.20	The Lord preserves all who him love,
PSA.145.20	that nought can them annoy:
PSA.145.20	But he all those that wicked are
PSA.145.20	will utterly destroy.
PSA.145.21	My mouth the praises of the Lord
PSA.145.21	to publish cease shall never:
PSA.145.21	Let all flesh bless his holy name
PSA.145.21	for ever and for ever.
PSA.146.1	Praise God. The Lord praise, O my soul.
PSA.146.2	I'll praise God while I live;
PSA.146.2	While I have being to my God
PSA.146.2	in songs I'll praises give.
PSA.146.3	Trust not in princes, nor man's son,
PSA.146.3	in whom there is no stay:
PSA.146.4	His breath departs, to's earth he turns;
PSA.146.4	that day his thoughts decay.
PSA.146.5	O happy is that man and blest,
PSA.146.5	whom Jacob's God doth aid;
PSA.146.5	Whose hope upon the Lord doth rest,
PSA.146.5	and on his God is stay'd:
PSA.146.6	Who made the earth and heavens high,
PSA.146.6	who made the swelling deep,
PSA.146.6	And all that is within the same;
PSA.146.6	who truth doth ever keep:
PSA.146.7	Who righteous judgment executes
PSA.146.7	for those oppress'd that be,
PSA.146.7	Who to the hungry giveth food;
PSA.146.7	God sets the pris'ners free.
PSA.146.8	The Lord doth give the blind their sight,
PSA.146.8	the bowed down doth raise:
PSA.146.8	The Lord doth dearly love all those
PSA.146.8	that walk in upright ways.
PSA.146.9	The stranger's shield, the widow's stay,
PSA.146.9	the orphan's help, is he:
PSA.146.9	But yet by him the wicked's way
PSA.146.9	turn'd upside down shall be.
PSA.146.10	The Lord shall reign for evermore:
PSA.146.10	thy God, O Sion, he
PSA.146.10	Reigns to all generations.
PSA.146.10	Praise to the Lord give ye.
PSA.147.1	Praise ye the Lord; for it is good
PSA.147.1	praise to our God to sing:
PSA.147.1	For it is pleasant, and to praise
PSA.147.1	it is a comely thing.
PSA.147.2	God doth build up Jerusalem;
PSA.147.2	and he it is alone
PSA.147.2	That the dispers'd of Israel
PSA.147.2	doth gather into one.
PSA.147.3	Those that are broken in their heart,
PSA.147.3	and grieved in their minds,
PSA.147.3	He healeth, and their painful wounds
PSA.147.3	he tenderly up-binds.
PSA.147.4	He counts the number of the stars;
PSA.147.4	he names them ev'ry one.
PSA.147.5	Great is our Lord, and of great pow'r;
PSA.147.5	his wisdom search can none.
PSA.147.6	The Lord lifts up the meek; and casts
PSA.147.6	the wicked to the ground.
PSA.147.7	Sing to the Lord, and give him thanks;
PSA.147.7	on harp his praises sound;
PSA.147.8	Who covereth the heav'n with clouds,
PSA.147.8	who for the earth below
PSA.147.8	Prepareth rain, who maketh grass
PSA.147.8	upon the mountains grow.
PSA.147.9	He gives the beast his food, he feeds
PSA.147.9	the ravens young that cry.
PSA.147.10	His pleasure not in horses' strength,
PSA.147.10	nor in man's legs, doth lie.
PSA.147.11	But in all those that do him fear
PSA.147.11	the Lord doth pleasure take;
PSA.147.11	In those that to his mercy do
PSA.147.11	by hope themselves betake.
PSA.147.12	The Lord praise, O Jerusalem;
PSA.147.12	Sion, thy God confess:
PSA.147.13	For thy gates' bars he maketh strong;
PSA.147.13	thy sons in thee doth bless.
PSA.147.14	He in thy borders maketh peace;
PSA.147.14	with fine wheat filleth thee.
PSA.147.15	He sends forth his command on earth,
PSA.147.15	his word runs speedily.
PSA.147.16	Hoar-frost, like ashes, scatt'reth he;
PSA.147.16	like wool he snow doth give:
PSA.147.17	Like morsels casteth forth his ice;
PSA.147.17	who in its cold can live?
PSA.147.18	He sendeth forth his mighty word,
PSA.147.18	and melteth them again;
PSA.147.18	His wind he makes to blow,
PSA.147.18	and then the waters flow amain.
PSA.147.19	The doctrine of his holy word
PSA.147.19	to Jacob he doth show;
PSA.147.19	His statutes and his judgments he
PSA.147.19	gives Israel to know.
PSA.147.20	To any nation never he
PSA.147.20	such favour did afford;
PSA.147.20	For they his judgments have not known.
PSA.147.20	O do ye praise the Lord.
PSA.148.1	Praise God. From heavens praise the Lord,
PSA.148.1	in heights praise to him be.
PSA.148.2	All ye his angels, praise ye him;

PSA.148.3	praise him, all stars of light.
PSA.148.4	Ye heav'ns of heav'ns him praise, and floods
PSA.148.4	above the heavens' height.
PSA.148.5	Let all the creatures praise the name
PSA.148.5	of our almighty Lord:
PSA.148.5	For he commanded, and they were
PSA.148.5	created by his word.
PSA.148.6	He also, for all times to come,
PSA.148.6	hath them establish'd sure;
PSA.148.6	He hath appointed them a law,
PSA.148.6	which ever shall endure.
PSA.148.7	Praise ye 
PSA.148.7	dragons, and ev'ry deep:
PSA.148.8	Fire, hail, snow, vapour, stormy wind,

PSA.148.9	All hills and mountains, fruitful trees,
PSA.148.9	and all ye cedars high:
PSA.148.10	Beasts, and all cattle, creeping things,
PSA.148.10	and all ye birds that fly.
PSA.148.11	Kings of the earth, all nations,
PSA.148.11	princes, earth's judges all:
PSA.148.12	Both young men, yea, and maidens too,
PSA.148.12	old men, and children small.
PSA.148.13	Let them God's name praise; for his name
PSA.148.13	alone is excellent:
PSA.148.13	His glory reacheth far above
PSA.148.13	the earth and firmament.
PSA.148.14	His people's horn, the praise of all
PSA.148.14	his saints, exalteth he;
PSA.148.14	Ev'n Isr'el's seed, a people near
PSA.148.14	to him. The Lord praise ye.
PSA.149.1	Praise ye the Lord: unto him sing
PSA.149.1	a new song, and his praise
PSA.149.1	In the assembly of his saints
PSA.149.1	in sweet psalms do ye raise.
PSA.149.2	Let Isr'el in his Maker joy,
PSA.149.2	and to him praises sing:
PSA.149.2	Let all that Sion's children are
PSA.149.2	be joyful in their King.
PSA.149.3	O let them unto his great name
PSA.149.3	give praises in the dance;
PSA.149.3	Let them with timbrel and with harp
PSA.149.3	in songs his praise advance.
PSA.149.4	For God doth pleasure take in those
PSA.149.4	that his own people be;
PSA.149.4	And he with his salvation
PSA.149.4	the meek will beautify.
PSA.149.5	And in his glory excellent
PSA.149.5	let all his saints rejoice:
PSA.149.5	Let them to him upon their beds
PSA.149.5	aloud lift up their voice.
PSA.149.6	Let in their mouth aloft be rais'd
PSA.149.6	the high praise of the Lord,
PSA.149.6	And let them have in their right hand
PSA.149.6	a sharp two-edged sword;
PSA.149.7	To execute the vengeance due
PSA.149.7	upon the heathen all,
PSA.149.7	And make deserved punishment
PSA.149.7	upon the people fall.
PSA.149.8	And ev'n with chains, as pris'ners, bind
PSA.149.8	their kings that them command;
PSA.149.8	Yea, and with iron fetters strong,
PSA.149.8	the nobles of their land.
PSA.149.9	On them the judgment to perform
PSA.149.9	found written in his word:
PSA.149.9	This honour is to all his saints.
PSA.149.9	O do ye praise the Lord.
PSA.150.1	Praise ye the Lord. God's praise within
PSA.150.1	his sanctuary raise;
PSA.150.1	And to him in the firmament
PSA.150.1	of his pow'r give ye praise.

PSA.150.2	in glorious majesty.

PSA.150.4	and organs, in the dance.

PSA.150.5	on cymbals sounding high.
