GEN.1.1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
GEN.1.2	The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.
GEN.1.3	Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
GEN.1.4	And God saw that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	God called the light “day” and the darkness “night.”
GEN.1.5	And evening passed and morning came, marking the first day.
GEN.1.6	Then God said, “Let there be a space between the waters, to separate the waters of the heavens from the waters of the earth.” 
GEN.1.7	And that is what happened. God made this space to separate the waters of the earth from the waters of the heavens. 
GEN.1.8	God called the space “sky.”
GEN.1.8	And evening passed and morning came, marking the second day.
GEN.1.9	Then God said, “Let the waters beneath the sky flow together into one place, so dry ground may appear.” And that is what happened. 
GEN.1.10	God called the dry ground “land” and the waters “seas.” And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.11	Then God said, “Let the land sprout with vegetation—every sort of seed-bearing plant, and trees that grow seed-bearing fruit. These seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came.” And that is what happened. 
GEN.1.12	The land produced vegetation—all sorts of seed-bearing plants, and trees with seed-bearing fruit. Their seeds produced plants and trees of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.13	And evening passed and morning came, marking the third day.
GEN.1.14	Then God said, “Let lights appear in the sky to separate the day from the night. Let them be signs to mark the seasons, days, and years. 
GEN.1.15	Let these lights in the sky shine down on the earth.” And that is what happened. 
GEN.1.16	God made two great lights—the larger one to govern the day, and the smaller one to govern the night. He also made the stars. 
GEN.1.17	God set these lights in the sky to light the earth, 
GEN.1.18	to govern the day and night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.19	And evening passed and morning came, marking the fourth day.
GEN.1.20	Then God said, “Let the waters swarm with fish and other life. Let the skies be filled with birds of every kind.” 
GEN.1.21	So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that scurries and swarms in the water, and every sort of bird—each producing offspring of the same kind. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.22	Then God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply. Let the fish fill the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.”
GEN.1.23	And evening passed and morning came, marking the fifth day.
GEN.1.24	Then God said, “Let the earth produce every sort of animal, each producing offspring of the same kind—livestock, small animals that scurry along the ground, and wild animals.” And that is what happened. 
GEN.1.25	God made all sorts of wild animals, livestock, and small animals, each able to produce offspring of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.26	Then God said, “Let us make human beings
GEN.1.27	So God created human beings
GEN.1.27	In the image of God he created them;
GEN.1.27	male and female he created them.
GEN.1.28	Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground.”
GEN.1.29	Then God said, “Look! I have given you every seed-bearing plant throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food. 
GEN.1.30	And I have given every green plant as food for all the wild animals, the birds in the sky, and the small animals that scurry along the ground—everything that has life.” And that is what happened.
GEN.1.31	Then God looked over all he had made, and he saw that it was very good!
GEN.1.31	And evening passed and morning came, marking the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	So the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything in them was completed. 
GEN.2.2	On the seventh day God had finished his work of creation, so he rested
GEN.2.3	And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, because it was the day when he rested from all his work of creation.
GEN.2.4	This is the account of the creation of the heavens and the earth.
GEN.2.4	When the 
GEN.2.5	neither wild plants nor grains were growing on the earth. For the 
GEN.2.6	Instead, springs
GEN.2.7	Then the 
GEN.2.8	Then the 
GEN.2.9	The 
GEN.2.10	A river flowed from the land of Eden, watering the garden and then dividing into four branches. 
GEN.2.11	The first branch, called the Pishon, flowed around the entire land of Havilah, where gold is found. 
GEN.2.12	The gold of that land is exceptionally pure; aromatic resin and onyx stone are also found there. 
GEN.2.13	The second branch, called the Gihon, flowed around the entire land of Cush. 
GEN.2.14	The third branch, called the Tigris, flowed east of the land of Asshur. The fourth branch is called the Euphrates.
GEN.2.15	The 
GEN.2.16	But the 
GEN.2.17	except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat its fruit, you are sure to die.”
GEN.2.18	Then the 
GEN.2.19	So the 
GEN.2.20	He gave names to all the livestock, all the birds of the sky, and all the wild animals. But still there was no helper just right for him.
GEN.2.21	So the 
GEN.2.22	Then the 
GEN.2.23	“At last!” the man exclaimed.
GEN.2.23	“This one is bone from my bone,
GEN.2.23	and flesh from my flesh!
GEN.2.23	She will be called ‘woman,’
GEN.2.23	because she was taken from ‘man.’”
GEN.2.24	This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.
GEN.2.25	Now the man and his wife were both naked, but they felt no shame.
GEN.3.1	The serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild animals the 
GEN.3.2	“Of course we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,” the woman replied. 
GEN.3.3	“It’s only the fruit from the tree in the middle of the garden that we are not allowed to eat. God said, ‘You must not eat it or even touch it; if you do, you will die.’”
GEN.3.4	“You won’t die!” the serpent replied to the woman. 
GEN.3.5	“God knows that your eyes will be opened as soon as you eat it, and you will be like God, knowing both good and evil.”
GEN.3.6	The woman was convinced. She saw that the tree was beautiful and its fruit looked delicious, and she wanted the wisdom it would give her. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too. 
GEN.3.7	At that moment their eyes were opened, and they suddenly felt shame at their nakedness. So they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.
GEN.3.8	When the cool evening breezes were blowing, the man
GEN.3.9	Then the 
GEN.3.10	He replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, so I hid. I was afraid because I was naked.”
GEN.3.11	“Who told you that you were naked?” the 
GEN.3.12	The man replied, “It was the woman you gave me who gave me the fruit, and I ate it.”
GEN.3.13	Then the 
GEN.3.13	“The serpent deceived me,” she replied. “That’s why I ate it.”
GEN.3.14	Then the 
GEN.3.14	“Because you have done this, you are cursed
GEN.3.14	more than all animals, domestic and wild.
GEN.3.14	You will crawl on your belly,
GEN.3.14	groveling in the dust as long as you live.
GEN.3.15	And I will cause hostility between you and the woman,
GEN.3.15	and between your offspring and her offspring.
GEN.3.15	He will strike
GEN.3.15	and you will strike his heel.”
GEN.3.16	Then he said to the woman,
GEN.3.16	“I will sharpen the pain of your pregnancy,
GEN.3.16	and in pain you will give birth.
GEN.3.16	And you will desire to control your husband,
GEN.3.16	but he will rule over you.
GEN.3.17	And to the man he said,
GEN.3.17	“Since you listened to your wife and ate from the tree
GEN.3.17	whose fruit I commanded you not to eat,
GEN.3.17	the ground is cursed because of you.
GEN.3.17	All your life you will struggle to scratch a living from it.
GEN.3.18	It will grow thorns and thistles for you,
GEN.3.18	though you will eat of its grains.
GEN.3.19	By the sweat of your brow
GEN.3.19	will you have food to eat
GEN.3.19	until you return to the ground
GEN.3.19	from which you were made.
GEN.3.19	For you were made from dust,
GEN.3.19	and to dust you will return.”
GEN.3.20	Then the man—Adam—named his wife Eve, because she would be the mother of all who live.
GEN.3.21	And the 
GEN.3.22	Then the 
GEN.3.23	So the 
GEN.3.24	After sending them out, the 
GEN.4.1	Now Adam
GEN.4.2	Later she gave birth to his brother and named him Abel.
GEN.4.2	When they grew up, Abel became a shepherd, while Cain cultivated the ground. 
GEN.4.3	When it was time for the harvest, Cain presented some of his crops as a gift to the 
GEN.4.4	Abel also brought a gift—the best portions of the firstborn lambs from his flock. The 
GEN.4.5	but he did not accept Cain and his gift. This made Cain very angry, and he looked dejected.
GEN.4.6	“Why are you so angry?” the 
GEN.4.7	You will be accepted if you do what is right. But if you refuse to do what is right, then watch out! Sin is crouching at the door, eager to control you. But you must subdue it and be its master.”
GEN.4.8	One day Cain suggested to his brother, “Let’s go out into the fields.”
GEN.4.9	Afterward the 
GEN.4.9	“I don’t know,” Cain responded. “Am I my brother’s guardian?”
GEN.4.10	But the 
GEN.4.11	Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has swallowed your brother’s blood. 
GEN.4.12	No longer will the ground yield good crops for you, no matter how hard you work! From now on you will be a homeless wanderer on the earth.”
GEN.4.13	Cain replied to the 
GEN.4.14	You have banished me from the land and from your presence; you have made me a homeless wanderer. Anyone who finds me will kill me!”
GEN.4.15	The 
GEN.4.16	So Cain left the 
GEN.4.17	Cain had sexual relations with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain founded a city, which he named Enoch, after his son. 
GEN.4.18	Enoch had a son named Irad. Irad became the father of
GEN.4.19	Lamech married two women. The first was named Adah, and the second was Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the first of those who raise livestock and live in tents. 
GEN.4.21	His brother’s name was Jubal, the first of all who play the harp and flute. 
GEN.4.22	Lamech’s other wife, Zillah, gave birth to a son named Tubal-cain. He became an expert in forging tools of bronze and iron. Tubal-cain had a sister named Naamah. 
GEN.4.23	One day Lamech said to his wives,
GEN.4.23	“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
GEN.4.23	listen to me, you wives of Lamech.
GEN.4.23	I have killed a man who attacked me,
GEN.4.23	a young man who wounded me.
GEN.4.24	If someone who kills Cain is punished seven times,
GEN.4.24	then the one who kills me will be punished seventy-seven times!”
GEN.4.25	Adam had sexual relations with his wife again, and she gave birth to another son. She named him Seth,
GEN.4.26	When Seth grew up, he had a son and named him Enosh. At that time people first began to worship the 
GEN.5.1	This is the written account of the descendants of Adam. When God created human beings,
GEN.5.2	He created them male and female, and he blessed them and called them “human.”
GEN.5.3	When Adam was 130 years old, he became the father of a son who was just like him—in his very image. He named his son Seth. 
GEN.5.4	After the birth of Seth, Adam lived another 800 years, and he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.5	Adam lived 930 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.6	When Seth was 105 years old, he became the father of
GEN.5.7	After the birth of
GEN.5.8	Seth lived 912 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.9	When Enosh was 90 years old, he became the father of Kenan. 
GEN.5.10	After the birth of Kenan, Enosh lived another 815 years, and he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.11	Enosh lived 905 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.12	When Kenan was 70 years old, he became the father of Mahalalel. 
GEN.5.13	After the birth of Mahalalel, Kenan lived another 840 years, and he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.14	Kenan lived 910 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.15	When Mahalalel was 65 years old, he became the father of Jared. 
GEN.5.16	After the birth of Jared, Mahalalel lived another 830 years, and he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.17	Mahalalel lived 895 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.18	When Jared was 162 years old, he became the father of Enoch. 
GEN.5.19	After the birth of Enoch, Jared lived another 800 years, and he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.20	Jared lived 962 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.21	When Enoch was 65 years old, he became the father of Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	After the birth of Methuselah, Enoch lived in close fellowship with God for another 300 years, and he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.23	Enoch lived 365 years, 
GEN.5.24	walking in close fellowship with God. Then one day he disappeared, because God took him.
GEN.5.25	When Methuselah was 187 years old, he became the father of Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	After the birth of Lamech, Methuselah lived another 782 years, and he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.27	Methuselah lived 969 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.28	When Lamech was 182 years old, he became the father of a son. 
GEN.5.29	Lamech named his son Noah, for he said, “May he bring us relief
GEN.5.30	After the birth of Noah, Lamech lived another 595 years, and he had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.31	Lamech lived 777 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.32	After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	Then the people began to multiply on the earth, and daughters were born to them. 
GEN.6.2	The sons of God saw the beautiful women
GEN.6.3	Then the 
GEN.6.4	In those days, and for some time after, giant Nephilites lived on the earth, for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with women, they gave birth to children who became the heroes and famous warriors of ancient times.
GEN.6.5	The 
GEN.6.6	So the 
GEN.6.7	And the 
GEN.6.8	But Noah found favor with the 
GEN.6.9	This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, the only blameless person living on earth at the time, and he walked in close fellowship with God. 
GEN.6.10	Noah was the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	Now God saw that the earth had become corrupt and was filled with violence. 
GEN.6.12	God observed all this corruption in the world, for everyone on earth was corrupt. 
GEN.6.13	So God said to Noah, “I have decided to destroy all living creatures, for they have filled the earth with violence. Yes, I will wipe them all out along with the earth!
GEN.6.14	“Build a large boat
GEN.6.15	Make the boat 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
GEN.6.16	Leave an 18-inch opening
GEN.6.17	“Look! I am about to cover the earth with a flood that will destroy every living thing that breathes. Everything on earth will die. 
GEN.6.18	But I will confirm my covenant with you. So enter the boat—you and your wife and your sons and their wives. 
GEN.6.19	Bring a pair of every kind of animal—a male and a female—into the boat with you to keep them alive during the flood. 
GEN.6.20	Pairs of every kind of bird, and every kind of animal, and every kind of small animal that scurries along the ground, will come to you to be kept alive. 
GEN.6.21	And be sure to take on board enough food for your family and for all the animals.”
GEN.6.22	So Noah did everything exactly as God had commanded him.
GEN.7.1	When everything was ready, the 
GEN.7.2	Take with you seven pairs—male and female—of each animal I have approved for eating and for sacrifice,
GEN.7.3	Also take seven pairs of every kind of bird. There must be a male and a female in each pair to ensure that all life will survive on the earth after the flood. 
GEN.7.4	Seven days from now I will make the rains pour down on the earth. And it will rain for forty days and forty nights, until I have wiped from the earth all the living things I have created.”
GEN.7.5	So Noah did everything as the 
GEN.7.6	Noah was 600 years old when the flood covered the earth. 
GEN.7.7	He went on board the boat to escape the flood—he and his wife and his sons and their wives. 
GEN.7.8	With them were all the various kinds of animals—those approved for eating and for sacrifice and those that were not—along with all the birds and the small animals that scurry along the ground. 
GEN.7.9	They entered the boat in pairs, male and female, just as God had commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	After seven days, the waters of the flood came and covered the earth.
GEN.7.11	When Noah was 600 years old, on the seventeenth day of the second month, all the underground waters erupted from the earth, and the rain fell in mighty torrents from the sky. 
GEN.7.12	The rain continued to fall for forty days and forty nights.
GEN.7.13	That very day Noah had gone into the boat with his wife and his sons—Shem, Ham, and Japheth—and their wives. 
GEN.7.14	With them in the boat were pairs of every kind of animal—domestic and wild, large and small—along with birds of every kind. 
GEN.7.15	Two by two they came into the boat, representing every living thing that breathes. 
GEN.7.16	A male and female of each kind entered, just as God had commanded Noah. Then the 
GEN.7.17	For forty days the floodwaters grew deeper, covering the ground and lifting the boat high above the earth. 
GEN.7.18	As the waters rose higher and higher above the ground, the boat floated safely on the surface. 
GEN.7.19	Finally, the water covered even the highest mountains on the earth, 
GEN.7.20	rising more than twenty-two feet
GEN.7.21	All the living things on earth died—birds, domestic animals, wild animals, small animals that scurry along the ground, and all the people. 
GEN.7.22	Everything that breathed and lived on dry land died. 
GEN.7.23	God wiped out every living thing on the earth—people, livestock, small animals that scurry along the ground, and the birds of the sky. All were destroyed. The only people who survived were Noah and those with him in the boat. 
GEN.7.24	And the floodwaters covered the earth for 150 days.
GEN.8.1	But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and livestock with him in the boat. He sent a wind to blow across the earth, and the floodwaters began to recede. 
GEN.8.2	The underground waters stopped flowing, and the torrential rains from the sky were stopped. 
GEN.8.3	So the floodwaters gradually receded from the earth. After 150 days, 
GEN.8.4	exactly five months from the time the flood began,
GEN.8.5	Two and a half months later,
GEN.8.6	After another forty days, Noah opened the window he had made in the boat 
GEN.8.7	and released a raven. The bird flew back and forth until the floodwaters on the earth had dried up. 
GEN.8.8	He also released a dove to see if the water had receded and it could find dry ground. 
GEN.8.9	But the dove could find no place to land because the water still covered the ground. So it returned to the boat, and Noah held out his hand and drew the dove back inside. 
GEN.8.10	After waiting another seven days, Noah released the dove again. 
GEN.8.11	This time the dove returned to him in the evening with a fresh olive leaf in its beak. Then Noah knew that the floodwaters were almost gone. 
GEN.8.12	He waited another seven days and then released the dove again. This time it did not come back.
GEN.8.13	Noah was now 601 years old. On the first day of the new year, ten and a half months after the flood began,
GEN.8.14	Two more months went by,
GEN.8.15	Then God said to Noah, 
GEN.8.16	“Leave the boat, all of you—you and your wife, and your sons and their wives. 
GEN.8.17	Release all the animals—the birds, the livestock, and the small animals that scurry along the ground—so they can be fruitful and multiply throughout the earth.”
GEN.8.18	So Noah, his wife, and his sons and their wives left the boat. 
GEN.8.19	And all of the large and small animals and birds came out of the boat, pair by pair.
GEN.8.20	Then Noah built an altar to the 
GEN.8.21	And the 
GEN.8.22	As long as the earth remains, there will be planting and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night.”
GEN.9.1	Then God blessed Noah and his sons and told them, “Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth. 
GEN.9.2	All the animals of the earth, all the birds of the sky, all the small animals that scurry along the ground, and all the fish in the sea will look on you with fear and terror. I have placed them in your power. 
GEN.9.3	I have given them to you for food, just as I have given you grain and vegetables. 
GEN.9.4	But you must never eat any meat that still has the lifeblood in it.
GEN.9.5	“And I will require the blood of anyone who takes another person’s life. If a wild animal kills a person, it must die. And anyone who murders a fellow human must die. 
GEN.9.6	If anyone takes a human life, that person’s life will also be taken by human hands. For God made human beings
GEN.9.7	Now be fruitful and multiply, and repopulate the earth.”
GEN.9.8	Then God told Noah and his sons, 
GEN.9.9	“I hereby confirm my covenant with you and your descendants, 
GEN.9.10	and with all the animals that were on the boat with you—the birds, the livestock, and all the wild animals—every living creature on earth. 
GEN.9.11	Yes, I am confirming my covenant with you. Never again will floodwaters kill all living creatures; never again will a flood destroy the earth.”
GEN.9.12	Then God said, “I am giving you a sign of my covenant with you and with all living creatures, for all generations to come. 
GEN.9.13	I have placed my rainbow in the clouds. It is the sign of my covenant with you and with all the earth. 
GEN.9.14	When I send clouds over the earth, the rainbow will appear in the clouds, 
GEN.9.15	and I will remember my covenant with you and with all living creatures. Never again will the floodwaters destroy all life. 
GEN.9.16	When I see the rainbow in the clouds, I will remember the eternal covenant between God and every living creature on earth.” 
GEN.9.17	Then God said to Noah, “Yes, this rainbow is the sign of the covenant I am confirming with all the creatures on earth.”
GEN.9.18	The sons of Noah who came out of the boat with their father were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham is the father of Canaan.) 
GEN.9.19	From these three sons of Noah came all the people who now populate the earth.
GEN.9.20	After the flood, Noah began to cultivate the ground, and he planted a vineyard. 
GEN.9.21	One day he drank some wine he had made, and he became drunk and lay naked inside his tent. 
GEN.9.22	Ham, the father of Canaan, saw that his father was naked and went outside and told his brothers. 
GEN.9.23	Then Shem and Japheth took a robe, held it over their shoulders, and backed into the tent to cover their father. As they did this, they looked the other way so they would not see him naked.
GEN.9.24	When Noah woke up from his stupor, he learned what Ham, his youngest son, had done. 
GEN.9.25	Then he cursed Canaan, the son of Ham:
GEN.9.25	“May Canaan be cursed!
GEN.9.25	May he be the lowest of servants to his relatives.”
GEN.9.26	Then Noah said,
GEN.9.26	“May the 
GEN.9.26	and may Canaan be his servant!
GEN.9.27	May God expand the territory of Japheth!
GEN.9.27	May Japheth share the prosperity of Shem,
GEN.9.27	and may Canaan be his servant.”
GEN.9.28	Noah lived another 350 years after the great flood. 
GEN.9.29	He lived 950 years, and then he died.
GEN.10.1	This is the account of the families of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the three sons of Noah. Many children were born to them after the great flood.
GEN.10.2	The descendants of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
GEN.10.3	The descendants of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
GEN.10.4	The descendants of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim.
GEN.10.5	Their descendants became the seafaring peoples that spread out to various lands, each identified by its own language, clan, and national identity.
GEN.10.6	The descendants of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
GEN.10.7	The descendants of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The descendants of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.
GEN.10.8	Cush was also the ancestor of Nimrod, who was the first heroic warrior on earth. 
GEN.10.9	Since he was the greatest hunter in the world,
GEN.10.10	He built his kingdom in the land of Babylonia,
GEN.10.11	From there he expanded his territory to Assyria,
GEN.10.12	and Resen (the great city located between Nineveh and Calah).
GEN.10.13	Mizraim was the ancestor of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites, 
GEN.10.14	Pathrusites, Casluhites, and the Caphtorites, from whom the Philistines came.
GEN.10.15	Canaan’s oldest son was Sidon, the ancestor of the Sidonians. Canaan was also the ancestor of the Hittites,
GEN.10.16	Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, 
GEN.10.17	Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, 
GEN.10.18	Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. The Canaanite clans eventually spread out, 
GEN.10.19	and the territory of Canaan extended from Sidon in the north to Gerar and Gaza in the south, and east as far as Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, near Lasha.
GEN.10.20	These were the descendants of Ham, identified by clan, language, territory, and national identity.
GEN.10.21	Sons were also born to Shem, the older brother of Japheth.
GEN.10.22	The descendants of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
GEN.10.23	The descendants of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
GEN.10.24	Arphaxad was the father of Shelah,
GEN.10.25	Eber had two sons. The first was named Peleg (which means “division”), for during his lifetime the people of the world were divided into different language groups. His brother’s name was Joktan.
GEN.10.26	Joktan was the ancestor of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were descendants of Joktan. 
GEN.10.30	The territory they occupied extended from Mesha all the way to Sephar in the eastern mountains.
GEN.10.31	These were the descendants of Shem, identified by clan, language, territory, and national identity.
GEN.10.32	These are the clans that descended from Noah’s sons, arranged by nation according to their lines of descent. All the nations of the earth descended from these clans after the great flood.
GEN.11.1	At one time all the people of the world spoke the same language and used the same words. 
GEN.11.2	As the people migrated to the east, they found a plain in the land of Babylonia
GEN.11.3	They began saying to each other, “Let’s make bricks and harden them with fire.” (In this region bricks were used instead of stone, and tar was used for mortar.) 
GEN.11.4	Then they said, “Come, let’s build a great city for ourselves with a tower that reaches into the sky. This will make us famous and keep us from being scattered all over the world.”
GEN.11.5	But the 
GEN.11.6	“Look!” he said. “The people are united, and they all speak the same language. After this, nothing they set out to do will be impossible for them! 
GEN.11.7	Come, let’s go down and confuse the people with different languages. Then they won’t be able to understand each other.”
GEN.11.8	In that way, the 
GEN.11.9	That is why the city was called Babel,
GEN.11.10	This is the account of Shem’s family.
GEN.11.10	Two years after the great flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of
GEN.11.11	After the birth of
GEN.11.12	When Arphaxad was 35 years old, he became the father of Shelah. 
GEN.11.13	After the birth of Shelah, Arphaxad lived another 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.14	When Shelah was 30 years old, he became the father of Eber. 
GEN.11.15	After the birth of Eber, Shelah lived another 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.16	When Eber was 34 years old, he became the father of Peleg. 
GEN.11.17	After the birth of Peleg, Eber lived another 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.18	When Peleg was 30 years old, he became the father of Reu. 
GEN.11.19	After the birth of Reu, Peleg lived another 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	When Reu was 32 years old, he became the father of Serug. 
GEN.11.21	After the birth of Serug, Reu lived another 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	When Serug was 30 years old, he became the father of Nahor. 
GEN.11.23	After the birth of Nahor, Serug lived another 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.24	When Nahor was 29 years old, he became the father of Terah. 
GEN.11.25	After the birth of Terah, Nahor lived another 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	After Terah was 70 years old, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	This is the account of Terah’s family. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot. 
GEN.11.28	But Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, the land of his birth, while his father, Terah, was still living. 
GEN.11.29	Meanwhile, Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah. (Milcah and her sister Iscah were daughters of Nahor’s brother Haran.) 
GEN.11.30	But Sarai was unable to become pregnant and had no children.
GEN.11.31	One day Terah took his son Abram, his daughter-in-law Sarai (his son Abram’s wife), and his grandson Lot (his son Haran’s child) and moved away from Ur of the Chaldeans. He was headed for the land of Canaan, but they stopped at Haran and settled there. 
GEN.11.32	Terah lived for 205 years
GEN.12.1	The 
GEN.12.2	I will make you into a great nation. I will bless you and make you famous, and you will be a blessing to others. 
GEN.12.3	I will bless those who bless you and curse those who treat you with contempt. All the families on earth will be blessed through you.”
GEN.12.4	So Abram departed as the 
GEN.12.5	He took his wife, Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all his wealth—his livestock and all the people he had taken into his household at Haran—and headed for the land of Canaan. When they arrived in Canaan, 
GEN.12.6	Abram traveled through the land as far as Shechem. There he set up camp beside the oak of Moreh. At that time, the area was inhabited by Canaanites.
GEN.12.7	Then the 
GEN.12.8	After that, Abram traveled south and set up camp in the hill country, with Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. There he built another altar and dedicated it to the 
GEN.12.9	Then Abram continued traveling south by stages toward the Negev.
GEN.12.10	At that time a severe famine struck the land of Canaan, forcing Abram to go down to Egypt, where he lived as a foreigner. 
GEN.12.11	As he was approaching the border of Egypt, Abram said to his wife, Sarai, “Look, you are a very beautiful woman. 
GEN.12.12	When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife. Let’s kill him; then we can have her!’ 
GEN.12.13	So please tell them you are my sister. Then they will spare my life and treat me well because of their interest in you.”
GEN.12.14	And sure enough, when Abram arrived in Egypt, everyone noticed Sarai’s beauty. 
GEN.12.15	When the palace officials saw her, they sang her praises to Pharaoh, their king, and Sarai was taken into his palace. 
GEN.12.16	Then Pharaoh gave Abram many gifts because of her—sheep, goats, cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.
GEN.12.17	But the 
GEN.12.18	So Pharaoh summoned Abram and accused him sharply. “What have you done to me?” he demanded. “Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ and allow me to take her as my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and get out of here!” 
GEN.12.20	Pharaoh ordered some of his men to escort them, and he sent Abram out of the country, along with his wife and all his possessions.
GEN.13.1	So Abram left Egypt and traveled north into the Negev, along with his wife and Lot and all that they owned. 
GEN.13.2	(Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.) 
GEN.13.3	From the Negev, they continued traveling by stages toward Bethel, and they pitched their tents between Bethel and Ai, where they had camped before. 
GEN.13.4	This was the same place where Abram had built the altar, and there he worshiped the 
GEN.13.5	Lot, who was traveling with Abram, had also become very wealthy with flocks of sheep and goats, herds of cattle, and many tents. 
GEN.13.6	But the land could not support both Abram and Lot with all their flocks and herds living so close together. 
GEN.13.7	So disputes broke out between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot. (At that time Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land.)
GEN.13.8	Finally Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not allow this conflict to come between us or our herdsmen. After all, we are close relatives! 
GEN.13.9	The whole countryside is open to you. Take your choice of any section of the land you want, and we will separate. If you want the land to the left, then I’ll take the land on the right. If you prefer the land on the right, then I’ll go to the left.”
GEN.13.10	Lot took a long look at the fertile plains of the Jordan Valley in the direction of Zoar. The whole area was well watered everywhere, like the garden of the 
GEN.13.11	Lot chose for himself the whole Jordan Valley to the east of them. He went there with his flocks and servants and parted company with his uncle Abram. 
GEN.13.12	So Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot moved his tents to a place near Sodom and settled among the cities of the plain. 
GEN.13.13	But the people of this area were extremely wicked and constantly sinned against the 
GEN.13.14	After Lot had gone, the 
GEN.13.15	I am giving all this land, as far as you can see, to you and your descendants
GEN.13.16	And I will give you so many descendants that, like the dust of the earth, they cannot be counted! 
GEN.13.17	Go and walk through the land in every direction, for I am giving it to you.”
GEN.13.18	So Abram moved his camp to Hebron and settled near the oak grove belonging to Mamre. There he built another altar to the 
GEN.14.1	About this time war broke out in the region. King Amraphel of Babylonia,
GEN.14.2	fought against King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar).
GEN.14.3	This second group of kings joined forces in Siddim Valley (that is, the valley of the Dead Sea
GEN.14.4	For twelve years they had been subject to King Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled against him.
GEN.14.5	One year later Kedorlaomer and his allies arrived and defeated the Rephaites at Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzites at Ham, the Emites at Shaveh-kiriathaim, 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites at Mount Seir, as far as El-paran at the edge of the wilderness. 
GEN.14.7	Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (now called Kadesh) and conquered all the territory of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites living in Hazazon-tamar.
GEN.14.8	Then the rebel kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (also called Zoar) prepared for battle in the valley of the Dead Sea.
GEN.14.9	They fought against King Kedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Babylonia, and King Arioch of Ellasar—four kings against five. 
GEN.14.10	As it happened, the valley of the Dead Sea was filled with tar pits. And as the army of the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into the tar pits, while the rest escaped into the mountains. 
GEN.14.11	The victorious invaders then plundered Sodom and Gomorrah and headed for home, taking with them all the spoils of war and the food supplies. 
GEN.14.12	They also captured Lot—Abram’s nephew who lived in Sodom—and carried off everything he owned.
GEN.14.13	But one of Lot’s men escaped and reported everything to Abram the Hebrew, who was living near the oak grove belonging to Mamre the Amorite. Mamre and his relatives, Eshcol and Aner, were Abram’s allies.
GEN.14.14	When Abram heard that his nephew Lot had been captured, he mobilized the 318 trained men who had been born into his household. Then he pursued Kedorlaomer’s army until he caught up with them at Dan. 
GEN.14.15	There he divided his men and attacked during the night. Kedorlaomer’s army fled, but Abram chased them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	Abram recovered all the goods that had been taken, and he brought back his nephew Lot with his possessions and all the women and other captives.
GEN.14.17	After Abram returned from his victory over Kedorlaomer and all his allies, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).
GEN.14.18	And Melchizedek, the king of Salem and a priest of God Most High,
GEN.14.19	Melchizedek blessed Abram with this blessing:
GEN.14.19	“Blessed be Abram by God Most High,
GEN.14.19	Creator of heaven and earth.
GEN.14.20	And blessed be God Most High,
GEN.14.20	who has defeated your enemies for you.”
GEN.14.20	Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all the goods he had recovered.
GEN.14.21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give back my people who were captured. But you may keep for yourself all the goods you have recovered.”
GEN.14.22	Abram replied to the king of Sodom, “I solemnly swear to the 
GEN.14.23	that I will not take so much as a single thread or sandal thong from what belongs to you. Otherwise you might say, ‘I am the one who made Abram rich.’ 
GEN.14.24	I will accept only what my young warriors have already eaten, and I request that you give a fair share of the goods to my allies—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre.”
GEN.15.1	Some time later, the 
GEN.15.2	But Abram replied, “O Sovereign 
GEN.15.3	You have given me no descendants of my own, so one of my servants will be my heir.”
GEN.15.4	Then the 
GEN.15.5	Then the 
GEN.15.6	And Abram believed the 
GEN.15.7	Then the 
GEN.15.8	But Abram replied, “O Sovereign 
GEN.15.9	The 
GEN.15.10	So Abram presented all these to him and killed them. Then he cut each animal down the middle and laid the halves side by side; he did not, however, cut the birds in half. 
GEN.15.11	Some vultures swooped down to eat the carcasses, but Abram chased them away.
GEN.15.12	As the sun was going down, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a terrifying darkness came down over him. 
GEN.15.13	Then the 
GEN.15.14	But I will punish the nation that enslaves them, and in the end they will come away with great wealth. 
GEN.15.15	(As for you, you will die in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.) 
GEN.15.16	After four generations your descendants will return here to this land, for the sins of the Amorites do not yet warrant their destruction.”
GEN.15.17	After the sun went down and darkness fell, Abram saw a smoking firepot and a flaming torch pass between the halves of the carcasses. 
GEN.15.18	So the 
GEN.15.19	the land now occupied by the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, 
GEN.15.21	Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had not been able to bear children for him. But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar. 
GEN.16.2	So Sarai said to Abram, “The 
GEN.16.3	So Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram as a wife. (This happened ten years after Abram had settled in the land of Canaan.)
GEN.16.4	So Abram had sexual relations with Hagar, and she became pregnant. But when Hagar knew she was pregnant, she began to treat her mistress, Sarai, with contempt. 
GEN.16.5	Then Sarai said to Abram, “This is all your fault! I put my servant into your arms, but now that she’s pregnant she treats me with contempt. The 
GEN.16.6	Abram replied, “Look, she is your servant, so deal with her as you see fit.” Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she finally ran away.
GEN.16.7	The angel of the 
GEN.16.8	The angel said to her, “Hagar, Sarai’s servant, where have you come from, and where are you going?”
GEN.16.8	“I’m running away from my mistress, Sarai,” she replied.
GEN.16.9	The angel of the 
GEN.16.10	Then he added, “I will give you more descendants than you can count.”
GEN.16.11	And the angel also said, “You are now pregnant and will give birth to a son. You are to name him Ishmael (which means ‘God hears’), for the 
GEN.16.12	This son of yours will be a wild man, as untamed as a wild donkey! He will raise his fist against everyone, and everyone will be against him. Yes, he will live in open hostility against all his relatives.”
GEN.16.13	Thereafter, Hagar used another name to refer to the 
GEN.16.14	So that well was named Beer-lahai-roi (which means “well of the Living One who sees me”). It can still be found between Kadesh and Bered.
GEN.16.15	So Hagar gave Abram a son, and Abram named him Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	Abram was eighty-six years old when Ishmael was born.
GEN.17.1	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the 
GEN.17.2	I will make a covenant with you, by which I will guarantee to give you countless descendants.”
GEN.17.3	At this, Abram fell face down on the ground. Then God said to him, 
GEN.17.4	“This is my covenant with you: I will make you the father of a multitude of nations! 
GEN.17.5	What’s more, I am changing your name. It will no longer be Abram. Instead, you will be called Abraham,
GEN.17.6	I will make you extremely fruitful. Your descendants will become many nations, and kings will be among them!
GEN.17.7	“I will confirm my covenant with you and your descendants
GEN.17.8	And I will give the entire land of Canaan, where you now live as a foreigner, to you and your descendants. It will be their possession forever, and I will be their God.”
GEN.17.9	Then God said to Abraham, “Your responsibility is to obey the terms of the covenant. You and all your descendants have this continual responsibility. 
GEN.17.10	This is the covenant that you and your descendants must keep: Each male among you must be circumcised. 
GEN.17.11	You must cut off the flesh of your foreskin as a sign of the covenant between me and you. 
GEN.17.12	From generation to generation, every male child must be circumcised on the eighth day after his birth. This applies not only to members of your family but also to the servants born in your household and the foreign-born servants whom you have purchased. 
GEN.17.13	All must be circumcised. Your bodies will bear the mark of my everlasting covenant. 
GEN.17.14	Any male who fails to be circumcised will be cut off from the covenant family for breaking the covenant.”
GEN.17.15	Then God said to Abraham, “Regarding Sarai, your wife—her name will no longer be Sarai. From now on her name will be Sarah.
GEN.17.16	And I will bless her and give you a son from her! Yes, I will bless her richly, and she will become the mother of many nations. Kings of nations will be among her descendants.”
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham bowed down to the ground, but he laughed to himself in disbelief. “How could I become a father at the age of 100?” he thought. “And how can Sarah have a baby when she is ninety years old?” 
GEN.17.18	So Abraham said to God, “May Ishmael live under your special blessing!”
GEN.17.19	But God replied, “No—Sarah, your wife, will give birth to a son for you. You will name him Isaac,
GEN.17.20	As for Ishmael, I will bless him also, just as you have asked. I will make him extremely fruitful and multiply his descendants. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	But my covenant will be confirmed with Isaac, who will be born to you and Sarah about this time next year.” 
GEN.17.22	When God had finished speaking, he left Abraham.
GEN.17.23	On that very day Abraham took his son, Ishmael, and every male in his household, including those born there and those he had bought. Then he circumcised them, cutting off their foreskins, just as God had told him. 
GEN.17.24	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised, 
GEN.17.25	and Ishmael, his son, was thirteen. 
GEN.17.26	Both Abraham and his son, Ishmael, were circumcised on that same day, 
GEN.17.27	along with all the other men and boys of the household, whether they were born there or bought as servants. All were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	The 
GEN.18.2	He looked up and noticed three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he ran to meet them and welcomed them, bowing low to the ground.
GEN.18.3	“My lord,” he said, “if it pleases you, stop here for a while. 
GEN.18.4	Rest in the shade of this tree while water is brought to wash your feet. 
GEN.18.5	And since you’ve honored your servant with this visit, let me prepare some food to refresh you before you continue on your journey.”
GEN.18.5	“All right,” they said. “Do as you have said.”
GEN.18.6	So Abraham ran back to the tent and said to Sarah, “Hurry! Get three large measures
GEN.18.7	Then Abraham ran out to the herd and chose a tender calf and gave it to his servant, who quickly prepared it. 
GEN.18.8	When the food was ready, Abraham took some yogurt and milk and the roasted meat, and he served it to the men. As they ate, Abraham waited on them in the shade of the trees.
GEN.18.9	“Where is Sarah, your wife?” the visitors asked.
GEN.18.9	“She’s inside the tent,” Abraham replied.
GEN.18.10	Then one of them said, “I will return to you about this time next year, and your wife, Sarah, will have a son!”
GEN.18.10	Sarah was listening to this conversation from the tent. 
GEN.18.11	Abraham and Sarah were both very old by this time, and Sarah was long past the age of having children. 
GEN.18.12	So she laughed silently to herself and said, “How could a worn-out woman like me enjoy such pleasure, especially when my master—my husband—is also so old?”
GEN.18.13	Then the 
GEN.18.14	Is anything too hard for the 
GEN.18.15	Sarah was afraid, so she denied it, saying, “I didn’t laugh.”
GEN.18.15	But the 
GEN.18.16	Then the men got up from their meal and looked out toward Sodom. As they left, Abraham went with them to send them on their way.
GEN.18.17	“Should I hide my plan from Abraham?” the 
GEN.18.18	“For Abraham will certainly become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him. 
GEN.18.19	I have singled him out so that he will direct his sons and their families to keep the way of the 
GEN.18.20	So the 
GEN.18.21	I am going down to see if their actions are as wicked as I have heard. If not, I want to know.”
GEN.18.22	The other men turned and headed toward Sodom, but the 
GEN.18.23	Abraham approached him and said, “Will you sweep away both the righteous and the wicked? 
GEN.18.24	Suppose you find fifty righteous people living there in the city—will you still sweep it away and not spare it for their sakes? 
GEN.18.25	Surely you wouldn’t do such a thing, destroying the righteous along with the wicked. Why, you would be treating the righteous and the wicked exactly the same! Surely you wouldn’t do that! Should not the Judge of all the earth do what is right?”
GEN.18.26	And the 
GEN.18.27	Then Abraham spoke again. “Since I have begun, let me speak further to my Lord, even though I am but dust and ashes. 
GEN.18.28	Suppose there are only forty-five righteous people rather than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?”
GEN.18.28	And the 
GEN.18.29	Then Abraham pressed his request further. “Suppose there are only forty?”
GEN.18.29	And the 
GEN.18.30	“Please don’t be angry, my Lord,” Abraham pleaded. “Let me speak—suppose only thirty righteous people are found?”
GEN.18.30	And the 
GEN.18.31	Then Abraham said, “Since I have dared to speak to the Lord, let me continue—suppose there are only twenty?”
GEN.18.31	And the 
GEN.18.32	Finally, Abraham said, “Lord, please don’t be angry with me if I speak one more time. Suppose only ten are found there?”
GEN.18.32	And the 
GEN.18.33	When the 
GEN.19.1	That evening the two angels came to the entrance of the city of Sodom. Lot was sitting there, and when he saw them, he stood up to meet them. Then he welcomed them and bowed with his face to the ground. 
GEN.19.2	“My lords,” he said, “come to my home to wash your feet, and be my guests for the night. You may then get up early in the morning and be on your way again.”
GEN.19.2	“Oh no,” they replied. “We’ll just spend the night out here in the city square.”
GEN.19.3	But Lot insisted, so at last they went home with him. Lot prepared a feast for them, complete with fresh bread made without yeast, and they ate. 
GEN.19.4	But before they retired for the night, all the men of Sodom, young and old, came from all over the city and surrounded the house. 
GEN.19.5	They shouted to Lot, “Where are the men who came to spend the night with you? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them!”
GEN.19.6	So Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him. 
GEN.19.7	“Please, my brothers,” he begged, “don’t do such a wicked thing. 
GEN.19.8	Look, I have two virgin daughters. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do with them as you wish. But please, leave these men alone, for they are my guests and are under my protection.”
GEN.19.9	“Stand back!” they shouted. “This fellow came to town as an outsider, and now he’s acting like our judge! We’ll treat you far worse than those other men!” And they lunged toward Lot to break down the door.
GEN.19.10	But the two angels
GEN.19.11	Then they blinded all the men, young and old, who were at the door of the house, so they gave up trying to get inside.
GEN.19.12	Meanwhile, the angels questioned Lot. “Do you have any other relatives here in the city?” they asked. “Get them out of this place—your sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else. 
GEN.19.13	For we are about to destroy this city completely. The outcry against this place is so great it has reached the 
GEN.19.14	So Lot rushed out to tell his daughters’ fiancés, “Quick, get out of the city! The 
GEN.19.15	At dawn the next morning the angels became insistent. “Hurry,” they said to Lot. “Take your wife and your two daughters who are here. Get out right now, or you will be swept away in the destruction of the city!”
GEN.19.16	When Lot still hesitated, the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and rushed them to safety outside the city, for the 
GEN.19.17	When they were safely out of the city, one of the angels ordered, “Run for your lives! And don’t look back or stop anywhere in the valley! Escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away!”
GEN.19.18	“Oh no, my lord!” Lot begged. 
GEN.19.19	“You have been so gracious to me and saved my life, and you have shown such great kindness. But I cannot go to the mountains. Disaster would catch up to me there, and I would soon die. 
GEN.19.20	See, there is a small village nearby. Please let me go there instead; don’t you see how small it is? Then my life will be saved.”
GEN.19.21	“All right,” the angel said, “I will grant your request. I will not destroy the little village. 
GEN.19.22	But hurry! Escape to it, for I can do nothing until you arrive there.” (This explains why that village was known as Zoar, which means “little place.”)
GEN.19.23	Lot reached the village just as the sun was rising over the horizon. 
GEN.19.24	Then the 
GEN.19.25	He utterly destroyed them, along with the other cities and villages of the plain, wiping out all the people and every bit of vegetation. 
GEN.19.26	But Lot’s wife looked back as she was following behind him, and she turned into a pillar of salt.
GEN.19.27	Abraham got up early that morning and hurried out to the place where he had stood in the 
GEN.19.28	He looked out across the plain toward Sodom and Gomorrah and watched as columns of smoke rose from the cities like smoke from a furnace.
GEN.19.29	But God had listened to Abraham’s request and kept Lot safe, removing him from the disaster that engulfed the cities on the plain.
GEN.19.30	Afterward Lot left Zoar because he was afraid of the people there, and he went to live in a cave in the mountains with his two daughters. 
GEN.19.31	One day the older daughter said to her sister, “There are no men left anywhere in this entire area, so we can’t get married like everyone else. And our father will soon be too old to have children. 
GEN.19.32	Come, let’s get him drunk with wine, and then we will have sex with him. That way we will preserve our family line through our father.”
GEN.19.33	So that night they got him drunk with wine, and the older daughter went in and had intercourse with her father. He was unaware of her lying down or getting up again.
GEN.19.34	The next morning the older daughter said to her younger sister, “I had sex with our father last night. Let’s get him drunk with wine again tonight, and you go in and have sex with him. That way we will preserve our family line through our father.” 
GEN.19.35	So that night they got him drunk with wine again, and the younger daughter went in and had intercourse with him. As before, he was unaware of her lying down or getting up again.
GEN.19.36	As a result, both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their own father. 
GEN.19.37	When the older daughter gave birth to a son, she named him Moab.
GEN.19.38	When the younger daughter gave birth to a son, she named him Ben-ammi.
GEN.20.1	Abraham moved south to the Negev and lived for a while between Kadesh and Shur, and then he moved on to Gerar. While living there as a foreigner, 
GEN.20.2	Abraham introduced his wife, Sarah, by saying, “She is my sister.” So King Abimelech of Gerar sent for Sarah and had her brought to him at his palace.
GEN.20.3	But that night God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are a dead man, for that woman you have taken is already married!”
GEN.20.4	But Abimelech had not slept with her yet, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? 
GEN.20.5	Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘Yes, he is my brother.’ I acted in complete innocence! My hands are clean.”
GEN.20.6	In the dream God responded, “Yes, I know you are innocent. That’s why I kept you from sinning against me, and why I did not let you touch her. 
GEN.20.7	Now return the woman to her husband, and he will pray for you, for he is a prophet. Then you will live. But if you don’t return her to him, you can be sure that you and all your people will die.”
GEN.20.8	Abimelech got up early the next morning and quickly called all his servants together. When he told them what had happened, his men were terrified. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called for Abraham. “What have you done to us?” he demanded. “What crime have I committed that deserves treatment like this, making me and my kingdom guilty of this great sin? No one should ever do what you have done! 
GEN.20.10	Whatever possessed you to do such a thing?”
GEN.20.11	Abraham replied, “I thought, ‘This is a godless place. They will want my wife and will kill me to get her.’ 
GEN.20.12	And she really is my sister, for we both have the same father, but different mothers. And I married her. 
GEN.20.13	When God called me to leave my father’s home and to travel from place to place, I told her, ‘Do me a favor. Wherever we go, tell the people that I am your brother.’”
GEN.20.14	Then Abimelech took some of his sheep and goats, cattle, and male and female servants, and he presented them to Abraham. He also returned his wife, Sarah, to him. 
GEN.20.15	Then Abimelech said, “Look over my land and choose any place where you would like to live.” 
GEN.20.16	And he said to Sarah, “Look, I am giving your ‘brother’ 1,000 pieces of silver
GEN.20.17	Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, so they could have children. 
GEN.20.18	For the 
GEN.21.1	The 
GEN.21.2	She became pregnant, and she gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age. This happened at just the time God had said it would. 
GEN.21.3	And Abraham named their son Isaac. 
GEN.21.4	Eight days after Isaac was born, Abraham circumcised him as God had commanded. 
GEN.21.5	Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born.
GEN.21.6	And Sarah declared, “God has brought me laughter.
GEN.21.7	Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse a baby? Yet I have given Abraham a son in his old age!”
GEN.21.8	When Isaac grew up and was about to be weaned, Abraham prepared a huge feast to celebrate the occasion. 
GEN.21.9	But Sarah saw Ishmael—the son of Abraham and her Egyptian servant Hagar—making fun of her son, Isaac.
GEN.21.10	So she turned to Abraham and demanded, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son. He is not going to share the inheritance with my son, Isaac. I won’t have it!”
GEN.21.11	This upset Abraham very much because Ishmael was his son. 
GEN.21.12	But God told Abraham, “Do not be upset over the boy and your servant. Do whatever Sarah tells you, for Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted. 
GEN.21.13	But I will also make a nation of the descendants of Hagar’s son because he is your son, too.”
GEN.21.14	So Abraham got up early the next morning, prepared food and a container of water, and strapped them on Hagar’s shoulders. Then he sent her away with their son, and she wandered aimlessly in the wilderness of Beersheba.
GEN.21.15	When the water was gone, she put the boy in the shade of a bush. 
GEN.21.16	Then she went and sat down by herself about a hundred yards
GEN.21.17	But God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, “Hagar, what’s wrong? Do not be afraid! God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. 
GEN.21.18	Go to him and comfort him, for I will make a great nation from his descendants.”
GEN.21.19	Then God opened Hagar’s eyes, and she saw a well full of water. She quickly filled her water container and gave the boy a drink.
GEN.21.20	And God was with the boy as he grew up in the wilderness. He became a skillful archer, 
GEN.21.21	and he settled in the wilderness of Paran. His mother arranged for him to marry a woman from the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.22	About this time, Abimelech came with Phicol, his army commander, to visit Abraham. “God is obviously with you, helping you in everything you do,” Abimelech said. 
GEN.21.23	“Swear to me in God’s name that you will never deceive me, my children, or any of my descendants. I have been loyal to you, so now swear that you will be loyal to me and to this country where you are living as a foreigner.”
GEN.21.24	Abraham replied, “Yes, I swear to it!” 
GEN.21.25	Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well that Abimelech’s servants had taken by force from Abraham’s servants.
GEN.21.26	“This is the first I’ve heard of it,” Abimelech answered. “I have no idea who is responsible. You have never complained about this before.”
GEN.21.27	Abraham then gave some of his sheep, goats, and cattle to Abimelech, and they made a treaty. 
GEN.21.28	But Abraham also took seven additional female lambs and set them off by themselves. 
GEN.21.29	Abimelech asked, “Why have you set these seven apart from the others?”
GEN.21.30	Abraham replied, “Please accept these seven lambs to show your agreement that I dug this well.” 
GEN.21.31	Then he named the place Beersheba (which means “well of the oath”), because that was where they had sworn the oath.
GEN.21.32	After making their covenant at Beersheba, Abimelech left with Phicol, the commander of his army, and they returned home to the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he worshiped the 
GEN.21.34	And Abraham lived as a foreigner in Philistine country for a long time.
GEN.22.1	Some time later, God tested Abraham’s faith. “Abraham!” God called.
GEN.22.1	“Yes,” he replied. “Here I am.”
GEN.22.2	“Take your son, your only son—yes, Isaac, whom you love so much—and go to the land of Moriah. Go and sacrifice him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will show you.”
GEN.22.3	The next morning Abraham got up early. He saddled his donkey and took two of his servants with him, along with his son, Isaac. Then he chopped wood for a fire for a burnt offering and set out for the place God had told him about. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day of their journey, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. 
GEN.22.5	“Stay here with the donkey,” Abraham told the servants. “The boy and I will travel a little farther. We will worship there, and then we will come right back.”
GEN.22.6	So Abraham placed the wood for the burnt offering on Isaac’s shoulders, while he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them walked on together, 
GEN.22.7	Isaac turned to Abraham and said, “Father?”
GEN.22.7	“Yes, my son?” Abraham replied.
GEN.22.7	“We have the fire and the wood,” the boy said, “but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?”
GEN.22.8	“God will provide a sheep for the burnt offering, my son,” Abraham answered. And they both walked on together.
GEN.22.9	When they arrived at the place where God had told him to go, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. Then he tied his son, Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. 
GEN.22.10	And Abraham picked up the knife to kill his son as a sacrifice. 
GEN.22.11	At that moment the angel of the 
GEN.22.11	“Yes,” Abraham replied. “Here I am!”
GEN.22.12	“Don’t lay a hand on the boy!” the angel said. “Do not hurt him in any way, for now I know that you truly fear God. You have not withheld from me even your son, your only son.”
GEN.22.13	Then Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. So he took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering in place of his son. 
GEN.22.14	Abraham named the place Yahweh-Yireh (which means “the 
GEN.22.15	Then the angel of the 
GEN.22.16	“This is what the 
GEN.22.17	I will certainly bless you. I will multiply your descendants
GEN.22.18	And through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed—all because you have obeyed me.”
GEN.22.19	Then they returned to the servants and traveled back to Beersheba, where Abraham continued to live.
GEN.22.20	Soon after this, Abraham heard that Milcah, his brother Nahor’s wife, had borne Nahor eight sons. 
GEN.22.21	The oldest was named Uz, the next oldest was Buz, followed by Kemuel (the ancestor of the Arameans), 
GEN.22.22	Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 
GEN.22.23	(Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.) In addition to these eight sons from Milcah, 
GEN.22.24	Nahor had four other children from his concubine Reumah. Their names were Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	When Sarah was 127 years old, 
GEN.23.2	she died at Kiriath-arba (now called Hebron) in the land of Canaan. There Abraham mourned and wept for her.
GEN.23.3	Then, leaving her body, he said to the Hittite elders, 
GEN.23.4	“Here I am, a stranger and a foreigner among you. Please sell me a piece of land so I can give my wife a proper burial.”
GEN.23.5	The Hittites replied to Abraham, 
GEN.23.6	“Listen, my lord, you are an honored prince among us. Choose the finest of our tombs and bury her there. No one here will refuse to help you in this way.”
GEN.23.7	Then Abraham bowed low before the Hittites 
GEN.23.8	and said, “Since you are willing to help me in this way, be so kind as to ask Ephron son of Zohar 
GEN.23.9	to let me buy his cave at Machpelah, down at the end of his field. I will pay the full price in the presence of witnesses, so I will have a permanent burial place for my family.”
GEN.23.10	Ephron was sitting there among the others, and he answered Abraham as the others listened, speaking publicly before all the Hittite elders of the town. 
GEN.23.11	“No, my lord,” he said to Abraham, “please listen to me. I will give you the field and the cave. Here in the presence of my people, I give it to you. Go and bury your dead.”
GEN.23.12	Abraham again bowed low before the citizens of the land, 
GEN.23.13	and he replied to Ephron as everyone listened. “No, listen to me. I will buy it from you. Let me pay the full price for the field so I can bury my dead there.”
GEN.23.14	Ephron answered Abraham, 
GEN.23.15	“My lord, please listen to me. The land is worth 400 pieces
GEN.23.16	So Abraham agreed to Ephron’s price and paid the amount he had suggested—400 pieces of silver, weighed according to the market standard. The Hittite elders witnessed the transaction.
GEN.23.17	So Abraham bought the plot of land belonging to Ephron at Machpelah, near Mamre. This included the field itself, the cave that was in it, and all the surrounding trees. 
GEN.23.18	It was transferred to Abraham as his permanent possession in the presence of the Hittite elders at the city gate. 
GEN.23.19	Then Abraham buried his wife, Sarah, there in Canaan, in the cave of Machpelah, near Mamre (also called Hebron). 
GEN.23.20	So the field and the cave were transferred from the Hittites to Abraham for use as a permanent burial place.
GEN.24.1	Abraham was now a very old man, and the 
GEN.24.2	One day Abraham said to his oldest servant, the man in charge of his household, “Take an oath by putting your hand under my thigh. 
GEN.24.3	Swear by the 
GEN.24.4	Go instead to my homeland, to my relatives, and find a wife there for my son Isaac.”
GEN.24.5	The servant asked, “But what if I can’t find a young woman who is willing to travel so far from home? Should I then take Isaac there to live among your relatives in the land you came from?”
GEN.24.6	“No!” Abraham responded. “Be careful never to take my son there. 
GEN.24.7	For the 
GEN.24.8	If she is unwilling to come back with you, then you are free from this oath of mine. But under no circumstances are you to take my son there.”
GEN.24.9	So the servant took an oath by putting his hand under the thigh of his master, Abraham. He swore to follow Abraham’s instructions. 
GEN.24.10	Then he loaded ten of Abraham’s camels with all kinds of expensive gifts from his master, and he traveled to distant Aram-naharaim. There he went to the town where Abraham’s brother Nahor had settled. 
GEN.24.11	He made the camels kneel beside a well just outside the town. It was evening, and the women were coming out to draw water.
GEN.24.12	“O 
GEN.24.13	See, I am standing here beside this spring, and the young women of the town are coming out to draw water. 
GEN.24.14	This is my request. I will ask one of them, ‘Please give me a drink from your jug.’ If she says, ‘Yes, have a drink, and I will water your camels, too!’—let her be the one you have selected as Isaac’s wife. This is how I will know that you have shown unfailing love to my master.”
GEN.24.15	Before he had finished praying, he saw a young woman named Rebekah coming out with her water jug on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, who was the son of Abraham’s brother Nahor and his wife, Milcah. 
GEN.24.16	Rebekah was very beautiful and old enough to be married, but she was still a virgin. She went down to the spring, filled her jug, and came up again. 
GEN.24.17	Running over to her, the servant said, “Please give me a little drink of water from your jug.”
GEN.24.18	“Yes, my lord,” she answered, “have a drink.” And she quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	When she had given him a drink, she said, “I’ll draw water for your camels, too, until they have had enough to drink.” 
GEN.24.20	So she quickly emptied her jug into the watering trough and ran back to the well to draw water for all his camels.
GEN.24.21	The servant watched her in silence, wondering whether or not the 
GEN.24.22	Then at last, when the camels had finished drinking, he took out a gold ring for her nose and two large gold bracelets
GEN.24.23	“Whose daughter are you?” he asked. “And please tell me, would your father have any room to put us up for the night?”
GEN.24.24	“I am the daughter of Bethuel,” she replied. “My grandparents are Nahor and Milcah. 
GEN.24.25	Yes, we have plenty of straw and feed for the camels, and we have room for guests.”
GEN.24.26	The man bowed low and worshiped the 
GEN.24.27	“Praise the 
GEN.24.28	The young woman ran home to tell her family everything that had happened. 
GEN.24.29	Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, who ran out to meet the man at the spring. 
GEN.24.30	He had seen the nose-ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man had said. So he rushed out to the spring, where the man was still standing beside his camels. 
GEN.24.31	Laban said to him, “Come and stay with us, you who are blessed by the 
GEN.24.32	So the man went home with Laban, and Laban unloaded the camels, gave him straw for their bedding, fed them, and provided water for the man and the camel drivers to wash their feet. 
GEN.24.33	Then food was served. But Abraham’s servant said, “I don’t want to eat until I have told you why I have come.”
GEN.24.33	“All right,” Laban said, “tell us.”
GEN.24.34	“I am Abraham’s servant,” he explained. 
GEN.24.35	“And the 
GEN.24.36	“When Sarah, my master’s wife, was very old, she gave birth to my master’s son, and my master has given him everything he owns. 
GEN.24.37	And my master made me take an oath. He said, ‘Do not allow my son to marry one of these local Canaanite women. 
GEN.24.38	Go instead to my father’s house, to my relatives, and find a wife there for my son.’
GEN.24.39	“But I said to my master, ‘What if I can’t find a young woman who is willing to go back with me?’ 
GEN.24.40	He responded, ‘The 
GEN.24.41	Then you will have fulfilled your obligation. But if you go to my relatives and they refuse to let her go with you, you will be free from my oath.’
GEN.24.42	“So today when I came to the spring, I prayed this prayer: ‘O 
GEN.24.43	See, I am standing here beside this spring. This is my request. When a young woman comes to draw water, I will say to her, “Please give me a little drink of water from your jug.” 
GEN.24.44	If she says, “Yes, have a drink, and I will draw water for your camels, too,” let her be the one you have selected to be the wife of my master’s son.’
GEN.24.45	“Before I had finished praying in my heart, I saw Rebekah coming out with her water jug on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ 
GEN.24.46	She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and said, ‘Yes, have a drink, and I will water your camels, too!’ So I drank, and then she watered the camels.
GEN.24.47	“Then I asked, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘I am the daughter of Bethuel, and my grandparents are Nahor and Milcah.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.
GEN.24.48	“Then I bowed low and worshiped the 
GEN.24.49	So tell me—will you or won’t you show unfailing love and faithfulness to my master? Please tell me yes or no, and then I’ll know what to do next.”
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “The 
GEN.24.51	Here is Rebekah; take her and go. Yes, let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the 
GEN.24.52	When Abraham’s servant heard their answer, he bowed down to the ground and worshiped the 
GEN.24.53	Then he brought out silver and gold jewelry and clothing and presented them to Rebekah. He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother. 
GEN.24.54	Then they ate their meal, and the servant and the men with him stayed there overnight.
GEN.24.54	But early the next morning, Abraham’s servant said, “Send me back to my master.”
GEN.24.55	“But we want Rebekah to stay with us at least ten days,” her brother and mother said. “Then she can go.”
GEN.24.56	But he said, “Don’t delay me. The 
GEN.24.57	“Well,” they said, “we’ll call Rebekah and ask her what she thinks.” 
GEN.24.58	So they called Rebekah. “Are you willing to go with this man?” they asked her.
GEN.24.58	And she replied, “Yes, I will go.”
GEN.24.59	So they said good-bye to Rebekah and sent her away with Abraham’s servant and his men. The woman who had been Rebekah’s childhood nurse went along with her. 
GEN.24.60	They gave her this blessing as she parted: 
GEN.24.60	“Our sister, may you become
GEN.24.60	the mother of many millions!
GEN.24.60	May your descendants be strong
GEN.24.60	and conquer the cities of their enemies.”
GEN.24.61	Then Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and followed the man. So Abraham’s servant took Rebekah and went on his way.
GEN.24.62	Meanwhile, Isaac, whose home was in the Negev, had returned from Beer-lahai-roi. 
GEN.24.63	One evening as he was walking and meditating in the fields, he looked up and saw the camels coming. 
GEN.24.64	When Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac, she quickly dismounted from her camel. 
GEN.24.65	“Who is that man walking through the fields to meet us?” she asked the servant.
GEN.24.65	And he replied, “It is my master.” So Rebekah covered her face with her veil. 
GEN.24.66	Then the servant told Isaac everything he had done.
GEN.24.67	And Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah’s tent, and she became his wife. He loved her deeply, and she was a special comfort to him after the death of his mother.
GEN.25.1	Abraham married another wife, whose name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	She gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. Dedan’s descendants were the Asshurites, Letushites, and Leummites. 
GEN.25.4	Midian’s sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. These were all descendants of Abraham through Keturah.
GEN.25.5	Abraham gave everything he owned to his son Isaac. 
GEN.25.6	But before he died, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them off to a land in the east, away from Isaac.
GEN.25.7	Abraham lived for 175 years, 
GEN.25.8	and he died at a ripe old age, having lived a long and satisfying life. He breathed his last and joined his ancestors in death. 
GEN.25.9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite. 
GEN.25.10	This was the field Abraham had purchased from the Hittites and where he had buried his wife Sarah. 
GEN.25.11	After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who settled near Beer-lahai-roi in the Negev.
GEN.25.12	This is the account of the family of Ishmael, the son of Abraham through Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian servant. 
GEN.25.13	Here is a list, by their names and clans, of Ishmael’s descendants: The oldest was Nebaioth, followed by Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	These twelve sons of Ishmael became the founders of twelve tribes named after them, listed according to the places they settled and camped. 
GEN.25.17	Ishmael lived for 137 years. Then he breathed his last and joined his ancestors in death. 
GEN.25.18	Ishmael’s descendants occupied the region from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt in the direction of Asshur. There they lived in open hostility toward all their relatives.
GEN.25.19	This is the account of the family of Isaac, the son of Abraham. 
GEN.25.20	When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban the Aramean.
GEN.25.21	Isaac pleaded with the 
GEN.25.22	But the two children struggled with each other in her womb. So she went to ask the 
GEN.25.23	And the 
GEN.25.24	And when the time came to give birth, Rebekah discovered that she did indeed have twins! 
GEN.25.25	The first one was very red at birth and covered with thick hair like a fur coat. So they named him Esau.
GEN.25.26	Then the other twin was born with his hand grasping Esau’s heel. So they named him Jacob.
GEN.25.27	As the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter. He was an outdoorsman, but Jacob had a quiet temperament, preferring to stay at home. 
GEN.25.28	Isaac loved Esau because he enjoyed eating the wild game Esau brought home, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
GEN.25.29	One day when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau arrived home from the wilderness exhausted and hungry. 
GEN.25.30	Esau said to Jacob, “I’m starved! Give me some of that red stew!” (This is how Esau got his other name, Edom, which means “red.”)
GEN.25.31	“All right,” Jacob replied, “but trade me your rights as the firstborn son.”
GEN.25.32	“Look, I’m dying of starvation!” said Esau. “What good is my birthright to me now?”
GEN.25.33	But Jacob said, “First you must swear that your birthright is mine.” So Esau swore an oath, thereby selling all his rights as the firstborn to his brother, Jacob.
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew. Esau ate the meal, then got up and left. He showed contempt for his rights as the firstborn.
GEN.26.1	A severe famine now struck the land, as had happened before in Abraham’s time. So Isaac moved to Gerar, where Abimelech, king of the Philistines, lived.
GEN.26.2	The 
GEN.26.3	Live here as a foreigner in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. I hereby confirm that I will give all these lands to you and your descendants,
GEN.26.4	I will cause your descendants to become as numerous as the stars of the sky, and I will give them all these lands. And through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed. 
GEN.26.5	I will do this because Abraham listened to me and obeyed all my requirements, commands, decrees, and instructions.” 
GEN.26.6	So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
GEN.26.7	When the men who lived there asked Isaac about his wife, Rebekah, he said, “She is my sister.” He was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “They will kill me to get her, because she is so beautiful.” 
GEN.26.8	But some time later, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looked out his window and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah.
GEN.26.9	Immediately, Abimelech called for Isaac and exclaimed, “She is obviously your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?”
GEN.26.9	“Because I was afraid someone would kill me to get her from me,” Isaac replied.
GEN.26.10	“How could you do this to us?” Abimelech exclaimed. “One of my people might easily have taken your wife and slept with her, and you would have made us guilty of great sin.”
GEN.26.11	Then Abimelech issued a public proclamation: “Anyone who touches this man or his wife will be put to death!”
GEN.26.12	When Isaac planted his crops that year, he harvested a hundred times more grain than he planted, for the 
GEN.26.13	He became a very rich man, and his wealth continued to grow. 
GEN.26.14	He acquired so many flocks of sheep and goats, herds of cattle, and servants that the Philistines became jealous of him. 
GEN.26.15	So the Philistines filled up all of Isaac’s wells with dirt. These were the wells that had been dug by the servants of his father, Abraham.
GEN.26.16	Finally, Abimelech ordered Isaac to leave the country. “Go somewhere else,” he said, “for you have become too powerful for us.”
GEN.26.17	So Isaac moved away to the Gerar Valley, where he set up their tents and settled down. 
GEN.26.18	He reopened the wells his father had dug, which the Philistines had filled in after Abraham’s death. Isaac also restored the names Abraham had given them.
GEN.26.19	Isaac’s servants also dug in the Gerar Valley and discovered a well of fresh water. 
GEN.26.20	But then the shepherds from Gerar came and claimed the spring. “This is our water,” they said, and they argued over it with Isaac’s herdsmen. So Isaac named the well Esek (which means “argument”). 
GEN.26.21	Isaac’s men then dug another well, but again there was a dispute over it. So Isaac named it Sitnah (which means “hostility”). 
GEN.26.22	Abandoning that one, Isaac moved on and dug another well. This time there was no dispute over it, so Isaac named the place Rehoboth (which means “open space”), for he said, “At last the 
GEN.26.23	From there Isaac moved to Beersheba, 
GEN.26.24	where the 
GEN.26.25	Then Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the 
GEN.26.26	One day King Abimelech came from Gerar with his adviser, Ahuzzath, and also Phicol, his army commander. 
GEN.26.27	“Why have you come here?” Isaac asked. “You obviously hate me, since you kicked me off your land.”
GEN.26.28	They replied, “We can plainly see that the 
GEN.26.29	Swear that you will not harm us, just as we have never troubled you. We have always treated you well, and we sent you away from us in peace. And now look how the 
GEN.26.30	So Isaac prepared a covenant feast to celebrate the treaty, and they ate and drank together. 
GEN.26.31	Early the next morning, they each took a solemn oath not to interfere with each other. Then Isaac sent them home again, and they left him in peace.
GEN.26.32	That very day Isaac’s servants came and told him about a new well they had dug. “We’ve found water!” they exclaimed. 
GEN.26.33	So Isaac named the well Shibah (which means “oath”). And to this day the town that grew up there is called Beersheba (which means “well of the oath”).
GEN.26.34	At the age of forty, Esau married two Hittite wives: Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon. 
GEN.26.35	But Esau’s wives made life miserable for Isaac and Rebekah.
GEN.27.1	One day when Isaac was old and turning blind, he called for Esau, his older son, and said, “My son.”
GEN.27.1	“Yes, Father?” Esau replied.
GEN.27.2	“I am an old man now,” Isaac said, “and I don’t know when I may die. 
GEN.27.3	Take your bow and a quiver full of arrows, and go out into the open country to hunt some wild game for me. 
GEN.27.4	Prepare my favorite dish, and bring it here for me to eat. Then I will pronounce the blessing that belongs to you, my firstborn son, before I die.”
GEN.27.5	But Rebekah overheard what Isaac had said to his son Esau. So when Esau left to hunt for the wild game, 
GEN.27.6	she said to her son Jacob, “Listen. I overheard your father say to Esau, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring me some wild game and prepare me a delicious meal. Then I will bless you in the 
GEN.27.8	Now, my son, listen to me. Do exactly as I tell you. 
GEN.27.9	Go out to the flocks, and bring me two fine young goats. I’ll use them to prepare your father’s favorite dish. 
GEN.27.10	Then take the food to your father so he can eat it and bless you before he dies.”
GEN.27.11	“But look,” Jacob replied to Rebekah, “my brother, Esau, is a hairy man, and my skin is smooth. 
GEN.27.12	What if my father touches me? He’ll see that I’m trying to trick him, and then he’ll curse me instead of blessing me.”
GEN.27.13	But his mother replied, “Then let the curse fall on me, my son! Just do what I tell you. Go out and get the goats for me!”
GEN.27.14	So Jacob went out and got the young goats for his mother. Rebekah took them and prepared a delicious meal, just the way Isaac liked it. 
GEN.27.15	Then she took Esau’s favorite clothes, which were there in the house, and gave them to her younger son, Jacob. 
GEN.27.16	She covered his arms and the smooth part of his neck with the skin of the young goats. 
GEN.27.17	Then she gave Jacob the delicious meal, including freshly baked bread.
GEN.27.18	So Jacob took the food to his father. “My father?” he said.
GEN.27.18	“Yes, my son,” Isaac answered. “Who are you—Esau or Jacob?”
GEN.27.19	Jacob replied, “It’s Esau, your firstborn son. I’ve done as you told me. Here is the wild game. Now sit up and eat it so you can give me your blessing.”
GEN.27.20	Isaac asked, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?”
GEN.27.20	“The 
GEN.27.21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come closer so I can touch you and make sure that you really are Esau.” 
GEN.27.22	So Jacob went closer to his father, and Isaac touched him. “The voice is Jacob’s, but the hands are Esau’s,” Isaac said. 
GEN.27.23	But he did not recognize Jacob, because Jacob’s hands felt hairy just like Esau’s. So Isaac prepared to bless Jacob. 
GEN.27.24	“But are you really my son Esau?” he asked.
GEN.27.24	“Yes, I am,” Jacob replied.
GEN.27.25	Then Isaac said, “Now, my son, bring me the wild game. Let me eat it, and then I will give you my blessing.” So Jacob took the food to his father, and Isaac ate it. He also drank the wine that Jacob served him. 
GEN.27.26	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come a little closer and kiss me, my son.”
GEN.27.27	So Jacob went over and kissed him. And when Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he was finally convinced, and he blessed his son. He said, “Ah! The smell of my son is like the smell of the outdoors, which the 
GEN.27.28	“From the dew of heaven
GEN.27.28	and the richness of the earth,
GEN.27.28	may God always give you abundant harvests of grain
GEN.27.28	and bountiful new wine.
GEN.27.29	May many nations become your servants,
GEN.27.29	and may they bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	May you be the master over your brothers,
GEN.27.29	and may your mother’s sons bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	All who curse you will be cursed,
GEN.27.29	and all who bless you will be blessed.”
GEN.27.30	As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and almost before Jacob had left his father, Esau returned from his hunt. 
GEN.27.31	Esau prepared a delicious meal and brought it to his father. Then he said, “Sit up, my father, and eat my wild game so you can give me your blessing.”
GEN.27.32	But Isaac asked him, “Who are you?”
GEN.27.32	Esau replied, “It’s your son, your firstborn son, Esau.”
GEN.27.33	Isaac began to tremble uncontrollably and said, “Then who just served me wild game? I have already eaten it, and I blessed him just before you came. And yes, that blessing must stand!”
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard his father’s words, he let out a loud and bitter cry. “Oh my father, what about me? Bless me, too!” he begged.
GEN.27.35	But Isaac said, “Your brother was here, and he tricked me. He has taken away your blessing.”
GEN.27.36	Esau exclaimed, “No wonder his name is Jacob, for now he has cheated me twice.
GEN.27.37	Isaac said to Esau, “I have made Jacob your master and have declared that all his brothers will be his servants. I have guaranteed him an abundance of grain and wine—what is left for me to give you, my son?”
GEN.27.38	Esau pleaded, “But do you have only one blessing? Oh my father, bless me, too!” Then Esau broke down and wept.
GEN.27.39	Finally, his father, Isaac, said to him, 
GEN.27.39	“You will live away from the richness of the earth,
GEN.27.39	and away from the dew of the heaven above.
GEN.27.40	You will live by your sword,
GEN.27.40	and you will serve your brother.
GEN.27.40	But when you decide to break free,
GEN.27.40	you will shake his yoke from your neck.”
GEN.27.41	From that time on, Esau hated Jacob because their father had given Jacob the blessing. And Esau began to scheme: “I will soon be mourning my father’s death. Then I will kill my brother, Jacob.”
GEN.27.42	But Rebekah heard about Esau’s plans. So she sent for Jacob and told him, “Listen, Esau is consoling himself by plotting to kill you. 
GEN.27.43	So listen carefully, my son. Get ready and flee to my brother, Laban, in Haran. 
GEN.27.44	Stay there with him until your brother cools off. 
GEN.27.45	When he calms down and forgets what you have done to him, I will send for you to come back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”
GEN.27.46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m sick and tired of these local Hittite women! I would rather die than see Jacob marry one of them.”
GEN.28.1	So Isaac called for Jacob, blessed him, and said, “You must not marry any of these Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.2	Instead, go at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of your grandfather Bethuel, and marry one of your uncle Laban’s daughters. 
GEN.28.3	May God Almighty
GEN.28.4	May God pass on to you and your descendants
GEN.28.5	So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram to stay with his uncle Laban, his mother’s brother, the son of Bethuel the Aramean.
GEN.28.6	Esau knew that his father, Isaac, had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to find a wife, and that he had warned Jacob, “You must not marry a Canaanite woman.” 
GEN.28.7	He also knew that Jacob had obeyed his parents and gone to Paddan-aram. 
GEN.28.8	It was now very clear to Esau that his father did not like the local Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.9	So Esau visited his uncle Ishmael’s family and married one of Ishmael’s daughters, in addition to the wives he already had. His new wife’s name was Mahalath. She was the sister of Nebaioth and the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son.
GEN.28.10	Meanwhile, Jacob left Beersheba and traveled toward Haran. 
GEN.28.11	At sundown he arrived at a good place to set up camp and stopped there for the night. Jacob found a stone to rest his head against and lay down to sleep. 
GEN.28.12	As he slept, he dreamed of a stairway that reached from the earth up to heaven. And he saw the angels of God going up and down the stairway.
GEN.28.13	At the top of the stairway stood the 
GEN.28.14	Your descendants will be as numerous as the dust of the earth! They will spread out in all directions—to the west and the east, to the north and the south. And all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your descendants. 
GEN.28.15	What’s more, I am with you, and I will protect you wherever you go. One day I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have finished giving you everything I have promised you.”
GEN.28.16	Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the 
GEN.28.17	But he was also afraid and said, “What an awesome place this is! It is none other than the house of God, the very gateway to heaven!”
GEN.28.18	The next morning Jacob got up very early. He took the stone he had rested his head against, and he set it upright as a memorial pillar. Then he poured olive oil over it. 
GEN.28.19	He named that place Bethel (which means “house of God”), although it was previously called Luz.
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made this vow: “If God will indeed be with me and protect me on this journey, and if he will provide me with food and clothing, 
GEN.28.21	and if I return safely to my father’s home, then the 
GEN.28.22	And this memorial pillar I have set up will become a place for worshiping God, and I will present to God a tenth of everything he gives me.”
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob hurried on, finally arriving in the land of the east. 
GEN.29.2	He saw a well in the distance. Three flocks of sheep and goats lay in an open field beside it, waiting to be watered. But a heavy stone covered the mouth of the well.
GEN.29.3	It was the custom there to wait for all the flocks to arrive before removing the stone and watering the animals. Afterward the stone would be placed back over the mouth of the well. 
GEN.29.4	Jacob went over to the shepherds and asked, “Where are you from, my friends?”
GEN.29.4	“We are from Haran,” they answered.
GEN.29.5	“Do you know a man there named Laban, the grandson of Nahor?” he asked.
GEN.29.5	“Yes, we do,” they replied.
GEN.29.6	“Is he doing well?” Jacob asked.
GEN.29.6	“Yes, he’s well,” they answered. “Look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the flock now.”
GEN.29.7	Jacob said, “Look, it’s still broad daylight—too early to round up the animals. Why don’t you water the sheep and goats so they can get back out to pasture?”
GEN.29.8	“We can’t water the animals until all the flocks have arrived,” they replied. “Then the shepherds move the stone from the mouth of the well, and we water all the sheep and goats.”
GEN.29.9	Jacob was still talking with them when Rachel arrived with her father’s flock, for she was a shepherd. 
GEN.29.10	And because Rachel was his cousin—the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother—and because the sheep and goats belonged to his uncle Laban, Jacob went over to the well and moved the stone from its mouth and watered his uncle’s flock. 
GEN.29.11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and he wept aloud. 
GEN.29.12	He explained to Rachel that he was her cousin on her father’s side—the son of her aunt Rebekah. So Rachel quickly ran and told her father, Laban.
GEN.29.13	As soon as Laban heard that his nephew Jacob had arrived, he ran out to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him home. When Jacob had told him his story, 
GEN.29.14	Laban exclaimed, “You really are my own flesh and blood!”
GEN.29.14	After Jacob had stayed with Laban for about a month, 
GEN.29.15	Laban said to him, “You shouldn’t work for me without pay just because we are relatives. Tell me how much your wages should be.”
GEN.29.16	Now Laban had two daughters. The older daughter was named Leah, and the younger one was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	There was no sparkle in Leah’s eyes,
GEN.29.18	Since Jacob was in love with Rachel, he told her father, “I’ll work for you for seven years if you’ll give me Rachel, your younger daughter, as my wife.”
GEN.29.19	“Agreed!” Laban replied. “I’d rather give her to you than to anyone else. Stay and work with me.” 
GEN.29.20	So Jacob worked seven years to pay for Rachel. But his love for her was so strong that it seemed to him but a few days.
GEN.29.21	Finally, the time came for him to marry her. “I have fulfilled my agreement,” Jacob said to Laban. “Now give me my wife so I can sleep with her.”
GEN.29.22	So Laban invited everyone in the neighborhood and prepared a wedding feast. 
GEN.29.23	But that night, when it was dark, Laban took Leah to Jacob, and he slept with her. 
GEN.29.24	(Laban had given Leah a servant, Zilpah, to be her maid.)
GEN.29.25	But when Jacob woke up in the morning—it was Leah! “What have you done to me?” Jacob raged at Laban. “I worked seven years for Rachel! Why have you tricked me?”
GEN.29.26	“It’s not our custom here to marry off a younger daughter ahead of the firstborn,” Laban replied. 
GEN.29.27	“But wait until the bridal week is over; then we’ll give you Rachel, too—provided you promise to work another seven years for me.”
GEN.29.28	So Jacob agreed to work seven more years. A week after Jacob had married Leah, Laban gave him Rachel, too. 
GEN.29.29	(Laban gave Rachel a servant, Bilhah, to be her maid.) 
GEN.29.30	So Jacob slept with Rachel, too, and he loved her much more than Leah. He then stayed and worked for Laban the additional seven years.
GEN.29.31	When the 
GEN.29.32	So Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben,
GEN.29.33	She soon became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She named him Simeon,
GEN.29.34	Then she became pregnant a third time and gave birth to another son. He was named Levi,
GEN.29.35	Once again Leah became pregnant and gave birth to another son. She named him Judah,
GEN.30.1	When Rachel saw that she wasn’t having any children for Jacob, she became jealous of her sister. She pleaded with Jacob, “Give me children, or I’ll die!”
GEN.30.2	Then Jacob became furious with Rachel. “Am I God?” he asked. “He’s the one who has kept you from having children!”
GEN.30.3	Then Rachel told him, “Take my maid, Bilhah, and sleep with her. She will bear children for me,
GEN.30.4	So Rachel gave her servant, Bilhah, to Jacob as a wife, and he slept with her. 
GEN.30.5	Bilhah became pregnant and presented him with a son. 
GEN.30.6	Rachel named him Dan,
GEN.30.7	Then Bilhah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	Rachel named him Naphtali,
GEN.30.9	Meanwhile, Leah realized that she wasn’t getting pregnant anymore, so she took her servant, Zilpah, and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
GEN.30.10	Soon Zilpah presented him with a son. 
GEN.30.11	Leah named him Gad,
GEN.30.12	Then Zilpah gave Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.13	And Leah named him Asher,
GEN.30.14	One day during the wheat harvest, Reuben found some mandrakes growing in a field and brought them to his mother, Leah. Rachel begged Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.15	But Leah angrily replied, “Wasn’t it enough that you stole my husband? Now will you steal my son’s mandrakes, too?”
GEN.30.15	Rachel answered, “I will let Jacob sleep with you tonight if you give me some of the mandrakes.”
GEN.30.16	So that evening, as Jacob was coming home from the fields, Leah went out to meet him. “You must come and sleep with me tonight!” she said. “I have paid for you with some mandrakes that my son found.” So that night he slept with Leah. 
GEN.30.17	And God answered Leah’s prayers. She became pregnant again and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.18	She named him Issachar,
GEN.30.19	Then Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob. 
GEN.30.20	She named him Zebulun,
GEN.30.21	Later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered Rachel’s plight and answered her prayers by enabling her to have children. 
GEN.30.23	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. “God has removed my disgrace,” she said. 
GEN.30.24	And she named him Joseph,
GEN.30.25	Soon after Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Please release me so I can go home to my own country. 
GEN.30.26	Let me take my wives and children, for I have earned them by serving you, and let me be on my way. You certainly know how hard I have worked for you.”
GEN.30.27	“Please listen to me,” Laban replied. “I have become wealthy, for
GEN.30.28	Tell me how much I owe you. Whatever it is, I’ll pay it.”
GEN.30.29	Jacob replied, “You know how hard I’ve worked for you, and how your flocks and herds have grown under my care. 
GEN.30.30	You had little indeed before I came, but your wealth has increased enormously. The 
GEN.30.31	“What wages do you want?” Laban asked again.
GEN.30.31	Jacob replied, “Don’t give me anything. Just do this one thing, and I’ll continue to tend and watch over your flocks. 
GEN.30.32	Let me inspect your flocks today and remove all the sheep and goats that are speckled or spotted, along with all the black sheep. Give these to me as my wages. 
GEN.30.33	In the future, when you check on the animals you have given me as my wages, you’ll see that I have been honest. If you find in my flock any goats without speckles or spots, or any sheep that are not black, you will know that I have stolen them from you.”
GEN.30.34	“All right,” Laban replied. “It will be as you say.” 
GEN.30.35	But that very day Laban went out and removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted or had white patches, and all the black sheep. He placed them in the care of his own sons, 
GEN.30.36	who took them a three-days’ journey from where Jacob was. Meanwhile, Jacob stayed and cared for the rest of Laban’s flock.
GEN.30.37	Then Jacob took some fresh branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled off strips of bark, making white streaks on them. 
GEN.30.38	Then he placed these peeled branches in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, for that was where they mated. 
GEN.30.39	And when they mated in front of the white-streaked branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
GEN.30.40	Jacob separated those lambs from Laban’s flock. And at mating time he turned the flock to face Laban’s animals that were streaked or black. This is how he built his own flock instead of increasing Laban’s.
GEN.30.41	Whenever the stronger females were ready to mate, Jacob would place the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of them. Then they would mate in front of the branches. 
GEN.30.42	But he didn’t do this with the weaker ones, so the weaker lambs belonged to Laban, and the stronger ones were Jacob’s. 
GEN.30.43	As a result, Jacob became very wealthy, with large flocks of sheep and goats, female and male servants, and many camels and donkeys.
GEN.31.1	But Jacob soon learned that Laban’s sons were grumbling about him. “Jacob has robbed our father of everything!” they said. “He has gained all his wealth at our father’s expense.” 
GEN.31.2	And Jacob began to notice a change in Laban’s attitude toward him.
GEN.31.3	Then the 
GEN.31.4	So Jacob called Rachel and Leah out to the field where he was watching his flock. 
GEN.31.5	He said to them, “I have noticed that your father’s attitude toward me has changed. But the God of my father has been with me. 
GEN.31.6	You know how hard I have worked for your father, 
GEN.31.7	but he has cheated me, changing my wages ten times. But God has not allowed him to do me any harm. 
GEN.31.8	For if he said, ‘The speckled animals will be your wages,’ the whole flock began to produce speckled young. And when he changed his mind and said, ‘The striped animals will be your wages,’ then the whole flock produced striped young. 
GEN.31.9	In this way, God has taken your father’s animals and given them to me.
GEN.31.10	“One time during the mating season, I had a dream and saw that the male goats mating with the females were streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
GEN.31.11	Then in my dream, the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ And I replied, ‘Yes, here I am.’
GEN.31.12	“The angel said, ‘Look up, and you will see that only the streaked, speckled, and spotted males are mating with the females of your flock. For I have seen how Laban has treated you. 
GEN.31.13	I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel,
GEN.31.14	Rachel and Leah responded, “That’s fine with us! We won’t inherit any of our father’s wealth anyway. 
GEN.31.15	He has reduced our rights to those of foreign women. And after he sold us, he wasted the money you paid him for us. 
GEN.31.16	All the wealth God has given you from our father legally belongs to us and our children. So go ahead and do whatever God has told you.”
GEN.31.17	So Jacob put his wives and children on camels, 
GEN.31.18	and he drove all his livestock in front of him. He packed all the belongings he had acquired in Paddan-aram and set out for the land of Canaan, where his father, Isaac, lived. 
GEN.31.19	At the time they left, Laban was some distance away, shearing his sheep. Rachel stole her father’s household idols and took them with her. 
GEN.31.20	Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, for they set out secretly and never told Laban they were leaving. 
GEN.31.21	So Jacob took all his possessions with him and crossed the Euphrates River,
GEN.31.22	Three days later, Laban was told that Jacob had fled. 
GEN.31.23	So he gathered a group of his relatives and set out in hot pursuit. He caught up with Jacob seven days later in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	But the previous night God had appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream and told him, “I’m warning you—leave Jacob alone!”
GEN.31.25	Laban caught up with Jacob as he was camped in the hill country of Gilead, and he set up his camp not far from Jacob’s. 
GEN.31.26	“What do you mean by deceiving me like this?” Laban demanded. “How dare you drag my daughters away like prisoners of war? 
GEN.31.27	Why did you slip away secretly? Why did you deceive me? And why didn’t you say you wanted to leave? I would have given you a farewell feast, with singing and music, accompanied by tambourines and harps. 
GEN.31.28	Why didn’t you let me kiss my daughters and grandchildren and tell them good-bye? You have acted very foolishly! 
GEN.31.29	I could destroy you, but the God of your father appeared to me last night and warned me, ‘Leave Jacob alone!’ 
GEN.31.30	I can understand your feeling that you must go, and your intense longing for your father’s home. But why have you stolen my gods?”
GEN.31.31	“I rushed away because I was afraid,” Jacob answered. “I thought you would take your daughters from me by force. 
GEN.31.32	But as for your gods, see if you can find them, and let the person who has taken them die! And if you find anything else that belongs to you, identify it before all these relatives of ours, and I will give it back!” But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the household idols.
GEN.31.33	Laban went first into Jacob’s tent to search there, then into Leah’s, and then the tents of the two servant wives—but he found nothing. Finally, he went into Rachel’s tent. 
GEN.31.34	But Rachel had taken the household idols and hidden them in her camel saddle, and now she was sitting on them. When Laban had thoroughly searched her tent without finding them, 
GEN.31.35	she said to her father, “Please, sir, forgive me if I don’t get up for you. I’m having my monthly period.” So Laban continued his search, but he could not find the household idols.
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob became very angry, and he challenged Laban. “What’s my crime?” he demanded. “What have I done wrong to make you chase after me as though I were a criminal? 
GEN.31.37	You have rummaged through everything I own. Now show me what you found that belongs to you! Set it out here in front of us, before our relatives, for all to see. Let them judge between us!
GEN.31.38	“For twenty years I have been with you, caring for your flocks. In all that time your sheep and goats never miscarried. In all those years I never used a single ram of yours for food. 
GEN.31.39	If any were attacked and killed by wild animals, I never showed you the carcass and asked you to reduce the count of your flock. No, I took the loss myself! You made me pay for every stolen animal, whether it was taken in broad daylight or in the dark of night.
GEN.31.40	“I worked for you through the scorching heat of the day and through cold and sleepless nights. 
GEN.31.41	Yes, for twenty years I slaved in your house! I worked for fourteen years earning your two daughters, and then six more years for your flock. And you changed my wages ten times! 
GEN.31.42	In fact, if the God of my father had not been on my side—the God of Abraham and the fearsome God of Isaac
GEN.31.43	Then Laban replied to Jacob, “These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks—in fact, everything you see is mine. But what can I do now about my daughters and their children? 
GEN.31.44	So come, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and it will be a witness to our commitment.”
GEN.31.45	So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument. 
GEN.31.46	Then he told his family members, “Gather some stones.” So they gathered stones and piled them in a heap. Then Jacob and Laban sat down beside the pile of stones to eat a covenant meal. 
GEN.31.47	To commemorate the event, Laban called the place Jegar-sahadutha (which means “witness pile” in Aramaic), and Jacob called it Galeed (which means “witness pile” in Hebrew).
GEN.31.48	Then Laban declared, “This pile of stones will stand as a witness to remind us of the covenant we have made today.” This explains why it was called Galeed—“Witness Pile.” 
GEN.31.49	But it was also called Mizpah (which means “watchtower”), for Laban said, “May the 
GEN.31.50	If you mistreat my daughters or if you marry other wives, God will see it even if no one else does. He is a witness to this covenant between us.
GEN.31.51	“See this pile of stones,” Laban continued, “and see this monument I have set between us. 
GEN.31.52	They stand between us as witnesses of our vows. I will never pass this pile of stones to harm you, and you must never pass these stones or this monument to harm me. 
GEN.31.53	I call on the God of our ancestors—the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of my grandfather Nahor—to serve as a judge between us.”
GEN.31.53	So Jacob took an oath before the fearsome God of his father, Isaac,
GEN.31.54	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice to God there on the mountain and invited everyone to a covenant feast. After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain.
GEN.31.55	Laban got up early the next morning, and he kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.
GEN.32.1	As Jacob started on his way again, angels of God came to meet him. 
GEN.32.2	When Jacob saw them, he exclaimed, “This is God’s camp!” So he named the place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	Then Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother, Esau, who was living in the region of Seir in the land of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	He told them, “Give this message to my master Esau: ‘Humble greetings from your servant Jacob. Until now I have been living with Uncle Laban, 
GEN.32.5	and now I own cattle, donkeys, flocks of sheep and goats, and many servants, both men and women. I have sent these messengers to inform my lord of my coming, hoping that you will be friendly to me.’”
GEN.32.6	After delivering the message, the messengers returned to Jacob and reported, “We met your brother, Esau, and he is already on his way to meet you—with an army of 400 men!” 
GEN.32.7	Jacob was terrified at the news. He divided his household, along with the flocks and herds and camels, into two groups. 
GEN.32.8	He thought, “If Esau meets one group and attacks it, perhaps the other group can escape.”
GEN.32.9	Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my grandfather Abraham, and God of my father, Isaac—O 
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of all the unfailing love and faithfulness you have shown to me, your servant. When I left home and crossed the Jordan River, I owned nothing except a walking stick. Now my household fills two large camps! 
GEN.32.11	O 
GEN.32.12	But you promised me, ‘I will surely treat you kindly, and I will multiply your descendants until they become as numerous as the sands along the seashore—too many to count.’”
GEN.32.13	Jacob stayed where he was for the night. Then he selected these gifts from his possessions to present to his brother, Esau: 
GEN.32.14	200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, 
GEN.32.15	30 female camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys. 
GEN.32.16	He divided these animals into herds and assigned each to different servants. Then he told his servants, “Go ahead of me with the animals, but keep some distance between the herds.”
GEN.32.17	He gave these instructions to the men leading the first group: “When my brother, Esau, meets you, he will ask, ‘Whose servants are you? Where are you going? Who owns these animals?’ 
GEN.32.18	You must reply, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob, but they are a gift for his master Esau. Look, he is coming right behind us.’”
GEN.32.19	Jacob gave the same instructions to the second and third herdsmen and to all who followed behind the herds: “You must say the same thing to Esau when you meet him. 
GEN.32.20	And be sure to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’”
GEN.32.20	Jacob thought, “I will try to appease him by sending gifts ahead of me. When I see him in person, perhaps he will be friendly to me.” 
GEN.32.21	So the gifts were sent on ahead, while Jacob himself spent that night in the camp.
GEN.32.22	During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two servant wives, and his eleven sons and crossed the Jabbok River with them. 
GEN.32.23	After taking them to the other side, he sent over all his possessions.
GEN.32.24	This left Jacob all alone in the camp, and a man came and wrestled with him until the dawn began to break. 
GEN.32.25	When the man saw that he would not win the match, he touched Jacob’s hip and wrenched it out of its socket. 
GEN.32.26	Then the man said, “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking!”
GEN.32.26	But Jacob said, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
GEN.32.27	“What is your name?” the man asked.
GEN.32.27	He replied, “Jacob.”
GEN.32.28	“Your name will no longer be Jacob,” the man told him. “From now on you will be called Israel,
GEN.32.29	“Please tell me your name,” Jacob said.
GEN.32.29	“Why do you want to know my name?” the man replied. Then he blessed Jacob there.
GEN.32.30	Jacob named the place Peniel (which means “face of God”), for he said, “I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared.” 
GEN.32.31	The sun was rising as Jacob left Peniel,
GEN.32.32	(Even today the people of Israel don’t eat the tendon near the hip socket because of what happened that night when the man strained the tendon of Jacob’s hip.)
GEN.33.1	Then Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming with his 400 men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and his two servant wives. 
GEN.33.2	He put the servant wives and their children at the front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last. 
GEN.33.3	Then Jacob went on ahead. As he approached his brother, he bowed to the ground seven times before him. 
GEN.33.4	Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they both wept.
GEN.33.5	Then Esau looked at the women and children and asked, “Who are these people with you?”
GEN.33.5	“These are the children God has graciously given to me, your servant,” Jacob replied. 
GEN.33.6	Then the servant wives came forward with their children and bowed before him. 
GEN.33.7	Next came Leah with her children, and they bowed before him. Finally, Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed before him.
GEN.33.8	“And what were all the flocks and herds I met as I came?” Esau asked.
GEN.33.8	Jacob replied, “They are a gift, my lord, to ensure your friendship.”
GEN.33.9	“My brother, I have plenty,” Esau answered. “Keep what you have for yourself.”
GEN.33.10	But Jacob insisted, “No, if I have found favor with you, please accept this gift from me. And what a relief to see your friendly smile. It is like seeing the face of God! 
GEN.33.11	Please take this gift I have brought you, for God has been very gracious to me. I have more than enough.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau finally accepted the gift.
GEN.33.12	“Well,” Esau said, “let’s be going. I will lead the way.”
GEN.33.13	But Jacob replied, “You can see, my lord, that some of the children are very young, and the flocks and herds have their young, too. If they are driven too hard, even for one day, all the animals could die. 
GEN.33.14	Please, my lord, go ahead of your servant. We will follow slowly, at a pace that is comfortable for the livestock and the children. I will meet you at Seir.”
GEN.33.15	“All right,” Esau said, “but at least let me assign some of my men to guide and protect you.”
GEN.33.15	Jacob responded, “That’s not necessary. It’s enough that you’ve received me warmly, my lord!”
GEN.33.16	So Esau turned around and started back to Seir that same day. 
GEN.33.17	Jacob, on the other hand, traveled on to Succoth. There he built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place was named Succoth (which means “shelters”).
GEN.33.18	Later, having traveled all the way from Paddan-aram, Jacob arrived safely at the town of Shechem, in the land of Canaan. There he set up camp outside the town. 
GEN.33.19	Jacob bought the plot of land where he camped from the family of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for 100 pieces of silver.
GEN.33.20	And there he built an altar and named it El-Elohe-Israel.
GEN.34.1	One day Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the young women who lived in the area. 
GEN.34.2	But when the local prince, Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, saw Dinah, he seized her and raped her. 
GEN.34.3	But then he fell in love with her, and he tried to win her affection with tender words. 
GEN.34.4	He said to his father, Hamor, “Get me this young girl. I want to marry her.”
GEN.34.5	Soon Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter, Dinah. But since his sons were out in the fields herding his livestock, he said nothing until they returned. 
GEN.34.6	Hamor, Shechem’s father, came to discuss the matter with Jacob. 
GEN.34.7	Meanwhile, Jacob’s sons had come in from the field as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious that their sister had been raped. Shechem had done a disgraceful thing against Jacob’s family,
GEN.34.8	Hamor tried to speak with Jacob and his sons. “My son Shechem is truly in love with your daughter,” he said. “Please let him marry her. 
GEN.34.9	In fact, let’s arrange other marriages, too. You give us your daughters for our sons, and we will give you our daughters for your sons. 
GEN.34.10	And you may live among us; the land is open to you! Settle here and trade with us. And feel free to buy property in the area.”
GEN.34.11	Then Shechem himself spoke to Dinah’s father and brothers. “Please be kind to me, and let me marry her,” he begged. “I will give you whatever you ask. 
GEN.34.12	No matter what dowry or gift you demand, I will gladly pay it—just give me the girl as my wife.”
GEN.34.13	But since Shechem had defiled their sister, Dinah, Jacob’s sons responded deceitfully to Shechem and his father, Hamor. 
GEN.34.14	They said to them, “We couldn’t possibly allow this, because you’re not circumcised. It would be a disgrace for our sister to marry a man like you! 
GEN.34.15	But here is a solution. If every man among you will be circumcised like we are, 
GEN.34.16	then we will give you our daughters, and we’ll take your daughters for ourselves. We will live among you and become one people. 
GEN.34.17	But if you don’t agree to be circumcised, we will take her and be on our way.”
GEN.34.18	Hamor and his son Shechem agreed to their proposal. 
GEN.34.19	Shechem wasted no time in acting on this request, for he wanted Jacob’s daughter desperately. Shechem was a highly respected member of his family, 
GEN.34.20	and he went with his father, Hamor, to present this proposal to the leaders at the town gate.
GEN.34.21	“These men are our friends,” they said. “Let’s invite them to live here among us and trade freely. Look, the land is large enough to hold them. We can take their daughters as wives and let them marry ours. 
GEN.34.22	But they will consider staying here and becoming one people with us only if all of our men are circumcised, just as they are. 
GEN.34.23	But if we do this, all their livestock and possessions will eventually be ours. Come, let’s agree to their terms and let them settle here among us.”
GEN.34.24	So all the men in the town council agreed with Hamor and Shechem, and every male in the town was circumcised. 
GEN.34.25	But three days later, when their wounds were still sore, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, who were Dinah’s full brothers, took their swords and entered the town without opposition. Then they slaughtered every male there, 
GEN.34.26	including Hamor and his son Shechem. They killed them with their swords, then took Dinah from Shechem’s house and returned to their camp.
GEN.34.27	Meanwhile, the rest of Jacob’s sons arrived. Finding the men slaughtered, they plundered the town because their sister had been defiled there. 
GEN.34.28	They seized all the flocks and herds and donkeys—everything they could lay their hands on, both inside the town and outside in the fields. 
GEN.34.29	They looted all their wealth and plundered their houses. They also took all their little children and wives and led them away as captives.
GEN.34.30	Afterward Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have ruined me! You’ve made me stink among all the people of this land—among all the Canaanites and Perizzites. We are so few that they will join forces and crush us. I will be ruined, and my entire household will be wiped out!”
GEN.34.31	“But why should we let him treat our sister like a prostitute?” they retorted angrily.
GEN.35.1	Then God said to Jacob, “Get ready and move to Bethel and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother, Esau.”
GEN.35.2	So Jacob told everyone in his household, “Get rid of all your pagan idols, purify yourselves, and put on clean clothing. 
GEN.35.3	We are now going to Bethel, where I will build an altar to the God who answered my prayers when I was in distress. He has been with me wherever I have gone.”
GEN.35.4	So they gave Jacob all their pagan idols and earrings, and he buried them under the great tree near Shechem. 
GEN.35.5	As they set out, a terror from God spread over the people in all the towns of that area, so no one attacked Jacob’s family.
GEN.35.6	Eventually, Jacob and his household arrived at Luz (also called Bethel) in Canaan. 
GEN.35.7	Jacob built an altar there and named the place El-bethel (which means “God of Bethel”), because God had appeared to him there when he was fleeing from his brother, Esau.
GEN.35.8	Soon after this, Rebekah’s old nurse, Deborah, died. She was buried beneath the oak tree in the valley below Bethel. Ever since, the tree has been called Allon-bacuth (which means “oak of weeping”).
GEN.35.9	Now that Jacob had returned from Paddan-aram, God appeared to him again at Bethel. God blessed him, 
GEN.35.10	saying, “Your name is Jacob, but you will not be called Jacob any longer. From now on your name will be Israel.”
GEN.35.11	Then God said, “I am El-Shaddai—‘God Almighty.’ Be fruitful and multiply. You will become a great nation, even many nations. Kings will be among your descendants! 
GEN.35.12	And I will give you the land I once gave to Abraham and Isaac. Yes, I will give it to you and your descendants after you.” 
GEN.35.13	Then God went up from the place where he had spoken to Jacob.
GEN.35.14	Jacob set up a stone pillar to mark the place where God had spoken to him. Then he poured wine over it as an offering to God and anointed the pillar with olive oil. 
GEN.35.15	And Jacob named the place Bethel (which means “house of God”), because God had spoken to him there.
GEN.35.16	Leaving Bethel, Jacob and his clan moved on toward Ephrath. But Rachel went into labor while they were still some distance away. Her labor pains were intense. 
GEN.35.17	After a very hard delivery, the midwife finally exclaimed, “Don’t be afraid—you have another son!” 
GEN.35.18	Rachel was about to die, but with her last breath she named the baby Ben-oni (which means “son of my sorrow”). The baby’s father, however, called him Benjamin (which means “son of my right hand”). 
GEN.35.19	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 
GEN.35.20	Jacob set up a stone monument over Rachel’s grave, and it can be seen there to this day.
GEN.35.21	Then Jacob
GEN.35.22	While he was living there, Reuben had intercourse with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Jacob soon heard about it.
GEN.35.22	These are the names of the twelve sons of Jacob:
GEN.35.23	The sons of Leah were Reuben (Jacob’s oldest son), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
GEN.35.24	The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.35.25	The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, were Dan and Naphtali.
GEN.35.26	The sons of Zilpah, Leah’s servant, were Gad and Asher.
GEN.35.26	These are the names of the sons who were born to Jacob at Paddan-aram.
GEN.35.27	So Jacob returned to his father, Isaac, in Mamre, which is near Kiriath-arba (now called Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had both lived as foreigners. 
GEN.35.28	Isaac lived for 180 years. 
GEN.35.29	Then he breathed his last and died at a ripe old age, joining his ancestors in death. And his sons, Esau and Jacob, buried him.
GEN.36.1	This is the account of the descendants of Esau (also known as Edom). 
GEN.36.2	Esau married two young women from Canaan: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite. 
GEN.36.3	He also married his cousin Basemath, who was the daughter of Ishmael and the sister of Nebaioth. 
GEN.36.4	Adah gave birth to a son named Eliphaz for Esau. Basemath gave birth to a son named Reuel. 
GEN.36.5	Oholibamah gave birth to sons named Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. All these sons were born to Esau in the land of Canaan.
GEN.36.6	Esau took his wives, his children, and his entire household, along with his livestock and cattle—all the wealth he had acquired in the land of Canaan—and moved away from his brother, Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	There was not enough land to support them both because of all the livestock and possessions they had acquired. 
GEN.36.8	So Esau (also known as Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir.
GEN.36.9	This is the account of Esau’s descendants, the Edomites, who lived in the hill country of Seir.
GEN.36.10	These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Esau’s wife Adah; and Reuel, the son of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.11	The descendants of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 
GEN.36.12	Timna, the concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz, gave birth to a son named Amalek. These are the descendants of Esau’s wife Adah.
GEN.36.13	The descendants of Reuel were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the descendants of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.14	Esau also had sons through Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon. Their names were Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
GEN.36.15	These are the descendants of Esau who became the leaders of various clans:
GEN.36.15	The descendants of Esau’s oldest son, Eliphaz, became the leaders of the clans of Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These are the clan leaders in the land of Edom who descended from Eliphaz. All these were descendants of Esau’s wife Adah.
GEN.36.17	The descendants of Esau’s son Reuel became the leaders of the clans of Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the clan leaders in the land of Edom who descended from Reuel. All these were descendants of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.18	The descendants of Esau and his wife Oholibamah became the leaders of the clans of Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the clan leaders who descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
GEN.36.19	These are the clans descended from Esau (also known as Edom), identified by their clan leaders.
GEN.36.20	These are the names of the tribes that descended from Seir the Horite. They lived in the land of Edom: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the Horite clan leaders, the descendants of Seir, who lived in the land of Edom.
GEN.36.22	The descendants of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotan’s sister was named Timna.
GEN.36.23	The descendants of Shobal were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
GEN.36.24	The descendants of Zibeon were Aiah and Anah. (This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs in the wilderness while he was grazing his father’s donkeys.)
GEN.36.25	The descendants of Anah were his son, Dishon, and his daughter, Oholibamah.
GEN.36.26	The descendants of Dishon
GEN.36.27	The descendants of Ezer were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
GEN.36.28	The descendants of Dishan were Uz and Aran.
GEN.36.29	So these were the leaders of the Horite clans: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.30	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. The Horite clans are named after their clan leaders, who lived in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.31	These are the kings who ruled in the land of Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites
GEN.36.32	Bela son of Beor, who ruled in Edom from his city of Dinhabah.
GEN.36.33	When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah became king in his place.
GEN.36.34	When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites became king in his place.
GEN.36.35	When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad became king in his place and ruled from the city of Avith. He was the one who defeated the Midianites in the land of Moab.
GEN.36.36	When Hadad died, Samlah from the city of Masrekah became king in his place.
GEN.36.37	When Samlah died, Shaul from the city of Rehoboth-on-the-River became king in his place.
GEN.36.38	When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Acbor became king in his place.
GEN.36.39	When Baal-hanan son of Acbor died, Hadad
GEN.36.40	These are the names of the leaders of the clans descended from Esau, who lived in the places named for them: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 
GEN.36.41	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	Magdiel, and Iram. These are the leaders of the clans of Edom, listed according to their settlements in the land they occupied. They all descended from Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites.
GEN.37.1	So Jacob settled again in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived as a foreigner.
GEN.37.2	This is the account of Jacob and his family. When Joseph was seventeen years old, he often tended his father’s flocks. He worked for his half brothers, the sons of his father’s wives Bilhah and Zilpah. But Joseph reported to his father some of the bad things his brothers were doing.
GEN.37.3	Jacob
GEN.37.4	But his brothers hated Joseph because their father loved him more than the rest of them. They couldn’t say a kind word to him.
GEN.37.5	One night Joseph had a dream, and when he told his brothers about it, they hated him more than ever. 
GEN.37.6	“Listen to this dream,” he said. 
GEN.37.7	“We were out in the field, tying up bundles of grain. Suddenly my bundle stood up, and your bundles all gathered around and bowed low before mine!”
GEN.37.8	His brothers responded, “So you think you will be our king, do you? Do you actually think you will reign over us?” And they hated him all the more because of his dreams and the way he talked about them.
GEN.37.9	Soon Joseph had another dream, and again he told his brothers about it. “Listen, I have had another dream,” he said. “The sun, moon, and eleven stars bowed low before me!”
GEN.37.10	This time he told the dream to his father as well as to his brothers, but his father scolded him. “What kind of dream is that?” he asked. “Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow to the ground before you?” 
GEN.37.11	But while his brothers were jealous of Joseph, his father wondered what the dreams meant.
GEN.37.12	Soon after this, Joseph’s brothers went to pasture their father’s flocks at Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	When they had been gone for some time, Jacob said to Joseph, “Your brothers are pasturing the sheep at Shechem. Get ready, and I will send you to them.”
GEN.37.13	“I’m ready to go,” Joseph replied.
GEN.37.14	“Go and see how your brothers and the flocks are getting along,” Jacob said. “Then come back and bring me a report.” So Jacob sent him on his way, and Joseph traveled to Shechem from their home in the valley of Hebron.
GEN.37.15	When he arrived there, a man from the area noticed him wandering around the countryside. “What are you looking for?” he asked.
GEN.37.16	“I’m looking for my brothers,” Joseph replied. “Do you know where they are pasturing their sheep?”
GEN.37.17	“Yes,” the man told him. “They have moved on from here, but I heard them say, ‘Let’s go on to Dothan.’” So Joseph followed his brothers to Dothan and found them there.
GEN.37.18	When Joseph’s brothers saw him coming, they recognized him in the distance. As he approached, they made plans to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	“Here comes the dreamer!” they said. 
GEN.37.20	“Come on, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns. We can tell our father, ‘A wild animal has eaten him.’ Then we’ll see what becomes of his dreams!”
GEN.37.21	But when Reuben heard of their scheme, he came to Joseph’s rescue. “Let’s not kill him,” he said. 
GEN.37.22	“Why should we shed any blood? Let’s just throw him into this empty cistern here in the wilderness. Then he’ll die without our laying a hand on him.” Reuben was secretly planning to rescue Joseph and return him to his father.
GEN.37.23	So when Joseph arrived, his brothers ripped off the beautiful robe he was wearing. 
GEN.37.24	Then they grabbed him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it. 
GEN.37.25	Then, just as they were sitting down to eat, they looked up and saw a caravan of camels in the distance coming toward them. It was a group of Ishmaelite traders taking a load of gum, balm, and aromatic resin from Gilead down to Egypt.
GEN.37.26	Judah said to his brothers, “What will we gain by killing our brother? We’d have to cover up the crime.
GEN.37.27	Instead of hurting him, let’s sell him to those Ishmaelite traders. After all, he is our brother—our own flesh and blood!” And his brothers agreed. 
GEN.37.28	So when the Ishmaelites, who were Midianite traders, came by, Joseph’s brothers pulled him out of the cistern and sold him to them for twenty pieces
GEN.37.29	Some time later, Reuben returned to get Joseph out of the cistern. When he discovered that Joseph was missing, he tore his clothes in grief. 
GEN.37.30	Then he went back to his brothers and lamented, “The boy is gone! What will I do now?”
GEN.37.31	Then the brothers killed a young goat and dipped Joseph’s robe in its blood. 
GEN.37.32	They sent the beautiful robe to their father with this message: “Look at what we found. Doesn’t this robe belong to your son?”
GEN.37.33	Their father recognized it immediately. “Yes,” he said, “it is my son’s robe. A wild animal must have eaten him. Joseph has clearly been torn to pieces!” 
GEN.37.34	Then Jacob tore his clothes and dressed himself in burlap. He mourned deeply for his son for a long time. 
GEN.37.35	His family all tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “I will go to my grave
GEN.37.36	Meanwhile, the Midianite traders
GEN.38.1	About this time, Judah left home and moved to Adullam, where he stayed with a man named Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	There he saw a Canaanite woman, the daughter of Shua, and he married her. When he slept with her, 
GEN.38.3	she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and he named the boy Er. 
GEN.38.4	Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son, and she named him Onan. 
GEN.38.5	And when she gave birth to a third son, she named him Shelah. At the time of Shelah’s birth, they were living at Kezib.
GEN.38.6	In the course of time, Judah arranged for his firstborn son, Er, to marry a young woman named Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	But Er was a wicked man in the 
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said to Er’s brother Onan, “Go and marry Tamar, as our law requires of the brother of a man who has died. You must produce an heir for your brother.”
GEN.38.9	But Onan was not willing to have a child who would not be his own heir. So whenever he had intercourse with his brother’s wife, he spilled the semen on the ground. This prevented her from having a child who would belong to his brother. 
GEN.38.10	But the 
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Go back to your parents’ home and remain a widow until my son Shelah is old enough to marry you.” (But Judah didn’t really intend to do this because he was afraid Shelah would also die, like his two brothers.) So Tamar went back to live in her father’s home.
GEN.38.12	Some years later Judah’s wife died. After the time of mourning was over, Judah and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went up to Timnah to supervise the shearing of his sheep. 
GEN.38.13	Someone told Tamar, “Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”
GEN.38.14	Tamar was aware that Shelah had grown up, but no arrangements had been made for her to come and marry him. So she changed out of her widow’s clothing and covered herself with a veil to disguise herself. Then she sat beside the road at the entrance to the village of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. 
GEN.38.15	Judah noticed her and thought she was a prostitute, since she had covered her face. 
GEN.38.16	So he stopped and propositioned her. “Let me have sex with you,” he said, not realizing that she was his own daughter-in-law.
GEN.38.16	“How much will you pay to have sex with me?” Tamar asked.
GEN.38.17	“I’ll send you a young goat from my flock,” Judah promised.
GEN.38.17	“But what will you give me to guarantee that you will send the goat?” she asked.
GEN.38.18	“What kind of guarantee do you want?” he replied.
GEN.38.18	She answered, “Leave me your identification seal and its cord and the walking stick you are carrying.” So Judah gave them to her. Then he had intercourse with her, and she became pregnant. 
GEN.38.19	Afterward she went back home, took off her veil, and put on her widow’s clothing as usual.
GEN.38.20	Later Judah asked his friend Hirah the Adullamite to take the young goat to the woman and to pick up the things he had given her as his guarantee. But Hirah couldn’t find her. 
GEN.38.21	So he asked the men who lived there, “Where can I find the shrine prostitute who was sitting beside the road at the entrance to Enaim?”
GEN.38.21	“We’ve never had a shrine prostitute here,” they replied.
GEN.38.22	So Hirah returned to Judah and told him, “I couldn’t find her anywhere, and the men of the village claim they’ve never had a shrine prostitute there.”
GEN.38.23	“Then let her keep the things I gave her,” Judah said. “I sent the young goat as we agreed, but you couldn’t find her. We’d be the laughingstock of the village if we went back again to look for her.”
GEN.38.24	About three months later, Judah was told, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has acted like a prostitute. And now, because of this, she’s pregnant.”
GEN.38.24	“Bring her out, and let her be burned!” Judah demanded.
GEN.38.25	But as they were taking her out to kill her, she sent this message to her father-in-law: “The man who owns these things made me pregnant. Look closely. Whose seal and cord and walking stick are these?”
GEN.38.26	Judah recognized them immediately and said, “She is more righteous than I am, because I didn’t arrange for her to marry my son Shelah.” And Judah never slept with Tamar again.
GEN.38.27	When the time came for Tamar to give birth, it was discovered that she was carrying twins. 
GEN.38.28	While she was in labor, one of the babies reached out his hand. The midwife grabbed it and tied a scarlet string around the child’s wrist, announcing, “This one came out first.” 
GEN.38.29	But then he pulled back his hand, and out came his brother! “What!” the midwife exclaimed. “How did you break out first?” So he was named Perez.
GEN.38.30	Then the baby with the scarlet string on his wrist was born, and he was named Zerah.
GEN.39.1	When Joseph was taken to Egypt by the Ishmaelite traders, he was purchased by Potiphar, an Egyptian officer. Potiphar was captain of the guard for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.
GEN.39.2	The 
GEN.39.3	Potiphar noticed this and realized that the 
GEN.39.4	This pleased Potiphar, so he soon made Joseph his personal attendant. He put him in charge of his entire household and everything he owned. 
GEN.39.5	From the day Joseph was put in charge of his master’s household and property, the 
GEN.39.6	So Potiphar gave Joseph complete administrative responsibility over everything he owned. With Joseph there, he didn’t worry about a thing—except what kind of food to eat!
GEN.39.6	Joseph was a very handsome and well-built young man, 
GEN.39.7	and Potiphar’s wife soon began to look at him lustfully. “Come and sleep with me,” she demanded.
GEN.39.8	But Joseph refused. “Look,” he told her, “my master trusts me with everything in his entire household. 
GEN.39.9	No one here has more authority than I do. He has held back nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How could I do such a wicked thing? It would be a great sin against God.”
GEN.39.10	She kept putting pressure on Joseph day after day, but he refused to sleep with her, and he kept out of her way as much as possible. 
GEN.39.11	One day, however, no one else was around when he went in to do his work. 
GEN.39.12	She came and grabbed him by his cloak, demanding, “Come on, sleep with me!” Joseph tore himself away, but he left his cloak in her hand as he ran from the house.
GEN.39.13	When she saw that she was holding his cloak and he had fled, 
GEN.39.14	she called out to her servants. Soon all the men came running. “Look!” she said. “My husband has brought this Hebrew slave here to make fools of us! He came into my room to rape me, but I screamed. 
GEN.39.15	When he heard me scream, he ran outside and got away, but he left his cloak behind with me.”
GEN.39.16	She kept the cloak with her until her husband came home. 
GEN.39.17	Then she told him her story. “That Hebrew slave you’ve brought into our house tried to come in and fool around with me,” she said. 
GEN.39.18	“But when I screamed, he ran outside, leaving his cloak with me!”
GEN.39.19	Potiphar was furious when he heard his wife’s story about how Joseph had treated her. 
GEN.39.20	So he took Joseph and threw him into the prison where the king’s prisoners were held, and there he remained. 
GEN.39.21	But the 
GEN.39.22	Before long, the warden put Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners and over everything that happened in the prison. 
GEN.39.23	The warden had no more worries, because Joseph took care of everything. The 
GEN.40.1	Some time later, Pharaoh’s chief cup-bearer and chief baker offended their royal master. 
GEN.40.2	Pharaoh became angry with these two officials, 
GEN.40.3	and he put them in the prison where Joseph was, in the palace of the captain of the guard. 
GEN.40.4	They remained in prison for quite some time, and the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, who looked after them.
GEN.40.5	While they were in prison, Pharaoh’s cup-bearer and baker each had a dream one night, and each dream had its own meaning. 
GEN.40.6	When Joseph saw them the next morning, he noticed that they both looked upset. 
GEN.40.7	“Why do you look so worried today?” he asked them.
GEN.40.8	And they replied, “We both had dreams last night, but no one can tell us what they mean.”
GEN.40.8	“Interpreting dreams is God’s business,” Joseph replied. “Go ahead and tell me your dreams.”
GEN.40.9	So the chief cup-bearer told Joseph his dream first. “In my dream,” he said, “I saw a grapevine in front of me. 
GEN.40.10	The vine had three branches that began to bud and blossom, and soon it produced clusters of ripe grapes. 
GEN.40.11	I was holding Pharaoh’s wine cup in my hand, so I took a cluster of grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup. Then I placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”
GEN.40.12	“This is what the dream means,” Joseph said. “The three branches represent three days. 
GEN.40.13	Within three days Pharaoh will lift you up and restore you to your position as his chief cup-bearer. 
GEN.40.14	And please remember me and do me a favor when things go well for you. Mention me to Pharaoh, so he might let me out of this place. 
GEN.40.15	For I was kidnapped from my homeland, the land of the Hebrews, and now I’m here in prison, but I did nothing to deserve it.”
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given the first dream such a positive interpretation, he said to Joseph, “I had a dream, too. In my dream there were three baskets of white pastries stacked on my head. 
GEN.40.17	The top basket contained all kinds of pastries for Pharaoh, but the birds came and ate them from the basket on my head.”
GEN.40.18	“This is what the dream means,” Joseph told him. “The three baskets also represent three days. 
GEN.40.19	Three days from now Pharaoh will lift you up and impale your body on a pole. Then birds will come and peck away at your flesh.”
GEN.40.20	Pharaoh’s birthday came three days later, and he prepared a banquet for all his officials and staff. He summoned
GEN.40.21	He then restored the chief cup-bearer to his former position, so he could again hand Pharaoh his cup. 
GEN.40.22	But Pharaoh impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had predicted when he interpreted his dream. 
GEN.40.23	Pharaoh’s chief cup-bearer, however, forgot all about Joseph, never giving him another thought.
GEN.41.1	Two full years later, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing on the bank of the Nile River. 
GEN.41.2	In his dream he saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river and begin grazing in the marsh grass. 
GEN.41.3	Then he saw seven more cows come up behind them from the Nile, but these were scrawny and thin. These cows stood beside the fat cows on the riverbank. 
GEN.41.4	Then the scrawny, thin cows ate the seven healthy, fat cows! At this point in the dream, Pharaoh woke up.
GEN.41.5	But he fell asleep again and had a second dream. This time he saw seven heads of grain, plump and beautiful, growing on a single stalk. 
GEN.41.6	Then seven more heads of grain appeared, but these were shriveled and withered by the east wind. 
GEN.41.7	And these thin heads swallowed up the seven plump, well-formed heads! Then Pharaoh woke up again and realized it was a dream.
GEN.41.8	The next morning Pharaoh was very disturbed by the dreams. So he called for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. When Pharaoh told them his dreams, not one of them could tell him what they meant.
GEN.41.9	Finally, the king’s chief cup-bearer spoke up. “Today I have been reminded of my failure,” he told Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.10	“Some time ago, you were angry with the chief baker and me, and you imprisoned us in the palace of the captain of the guard. 
GEN.41.11	One night the chief baker and I each had a dream, and each dream had its own meaning. 
GEN.41.12	There was a young Hebrew man with us in the prison who was a slave of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he told us what each of our dreams meant. 
GEN.41.13	And everything happened just as he had predicted. I was restored to my position as cup-bearer, and the chief baker was executed and impaled on a pole.”
GEN.41.14	Pharaoh sent for Joseph at once, and he was quickly brought from the prison. After he shaved and changed his clothes, he went in and stood before Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.15	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream last night, and no one here can tell me what it means. But I have heard that when you hear about a dream you can interpret it.”
GEN.41.16	“It is beyond my power to do this,” Joseph replied. “But God can tell you what it means and set you at ease.”
GEN.41.17	So Pharaoh told Joseph his dream. “In my dream,” he said, “I was standing on the bank of the Nile River, 
GEN.41.18	and I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river and begin grazing in the marsh grass. 
GEN.41.19	But then I saw seven sick-looking cows, scrawny and thin, come up after them. I’ve never seen such sorry-looking animals in all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.20	These thin, scrawny cows ate the seven fat cows. 
GEN.41.21	But afterward you wouldn’t have known it, for they were still as thin and scrawny as before! Then I woke up.
GEN.41.22	“In my dream I also saw seven heads of grain, full and beautiful, growing on a single stalk. 
GEN.41.23	Then seven more heads of grain appeared, but these were blighted, shriveled, and withered by the east wind. 
GEN.41.24	And the shriveled heads swallowed the seven healthy heads. I told these dreams to the magicians, but no one could tell me what they mean.”
GEN.41.25	Joseph responded, “Both of Pharaoh’s dreams mean the same thing. God is telling Pharaoh in advance what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.26	The seven healthy cows and the seven healthy heads of grain both represent seven years of prosperity. 
GEN.41.27	The seven thin, scrawny cows that came up later and the seven thin heads of grain, withered by the east wind, represent seven years of famine.
GEN.41.28	“This will happen just as I have described it, for God has revealed to Pharaoh in advance what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.29	The next seven years will be a period of great prosperity throughout the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.30	But afterward there will be seven years of famine so great that all the prosperity will be forgotten in Egypt. Famine will destroy the land. 
GEN.41.31	This famine will be so severe that even the memory of the good years will be erased. 
GEN.41.32	As for having two similar dreams, it means that these events have been decreed by God, and he will soon make them happen.
GEN.41.33	“Therefore, Pharaoh should find an intelligent and wise man and put him in charge of the entire land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Then Pharaoh should appoint supervisors over the land and let them collect one-fifth of all the crops during the seven good years. 
GEN.41.35	Have them gather all the food produced in the good years that are just ahead and bring it to Pharaoh’s storehouses. Store it away, and guard it so there will be food in the cities. 
GEN.41.36	That way there will be enough to eat when the seven years of famine come to the land of Egypt. Otherwise this famine will destroy the land.”
GEN.41.37	Joseph’s suggestions were well received by Pharaoh and his officials. 
GEN.41.38	So Pharaoh asked his officials, “Can we find anyone else like this man so obviously filled with the spirit of God?” 
GEN.41.39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has revealed the meaning of the dreams to you, clearly no one else is as intelligent or wise as you are. 
GEN.41.40	You will be in charge of my court, and all my people will take orders from you. Only I, sitting on my throne, will have a rank higher than yours.”
GEN.41.41	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I hereby put you in charge of the entire land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and placed it on Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in fine linen clothing and hung a gold chain around his neck. 
GEN.41.43	Then he had Joseph ride in the chariot reserved for his second-in-command. And wherever Joseph went, the command was shouted, “Kneel down!” So Pharaoh put Joseph in charge of all Egypt. 
GEN.41.44	And Pharaoh said to him, “I am Pharaoh, but no one will lift a hand or foot in the entire land of Egypt without your approval.”
GEN.41.45	Then Pharaoh gave Joseph a new Egyptian name, Zaphenath-paneah.
GEN.41.46	He was thirty years old when he began serving in the court of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And when Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence, he inspected the entire land of Egypt.
GEN.41.47	As predicted, for seven years the land produced bumper crops. 
GEN.41.48	During those years, Joseph gathered all the crops grown in Egypt and stored the grain from the surrounding fields in the cities. 
GEN.41.49	He piled up huge amounts of grain like sand on the seashore. Finally, he stopped keeping records because there was too much to measure.
GEN.41.50	During this time, before the first of the famine years, two sons were born to Joseph and his wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On. 
GEN.41.51	Joseph named his older son Manasseh,
GEN.41.52	Joseph named his second son Ephraim,
GEN.41.53	At last the seven years of bumper crops throughout the land of Egypt came to an end. 
GEN.41.54	Then the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had predicted. The famine also struck all the surrounding countries, but throughout Egypt there was plenty of food. 
GEN.41.55	Eventually, however, the famine spread throughout the land of Egypt as well. And when the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, he told them, “Go to Joseph, and do whatever he tells you.” 
GEN.41.56	So with severe famine everywhere, Joseph opened up the storehouses and distributed grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.57	And people from all around came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph because the famine was severe throughout the world.
GEN.42.1	When Jacob heard that grain was available in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you standing around looking at one another? 
GEN.42.2	I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy enough grain to keep us alive. Otherwise we’ll die.”
GEN.42.3	So Joseph’s ten older brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob wouldn’t let Joseph’s younger brother, Benjamin, go with them, for fear some harm might come to him. 
GEN.42.5	So Jacob’s
GEN.42.6	Since Joseph was governor of all Egypt and in charge of selling grain to all the people, it was to him that his brothers came. When they arrived, they bowed before him with their faces to the ground. 
GEN.42.7	Joseph recognized his brothers instantly, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. “Where are you from?” he demanded.
GEN.42.7	“From the land of Canaan,” they replied. “We have come to buy food.”
GEN.42.8	Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they didn’t recognize him. 
GEN.42.9	And he remembered the dreams he’d had about them many years before. He said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become.”
GEN.42.10	“No, my lord!” they exclaimed. “Your servants have simply come to buy food. 
GEN.42.11	We are all brothers—members of the same family. We are honest men, sir! We are not spies!”
GEN.42.12	“Yes, you are!” Joseph insisted. “You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become.”
GEN.42.13	“Sir,” they said, “there are actually twelve of us. We, your servants, are all brothers, sons of a man living in the land of Canaan. Our youngest brother is back there with our father right now, and one of our brothers is no longer with us.”
GEN.42.14	But Joseph insisted, “As I said, you are spies! 
GEN.42.15	This is how I will test your story. I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you will never leave Egypt unless your youngest brother comes here! 
GEN.42.16	One of you must go and get your brother. I’ll keep the rest of you here in prison. Then we’ll find out whether or not your story is true. By the life of Pharaoh, if it turns out that you don’t have a younger brother, then I’ll know you are spies.”
GEN.42.17	So Joseph put them all in prison for three days. 
GEN.42.18	On the third day Joseph said to them, “I am a God-fearing man. If you do as I say, you will live. 
GEN.42.19	If you really are honest men, choose one of your brothers to remain in prison. The rest of you may go home with grain for your starving families. 
GEN.42.20	But you must bring your youngest brother back to me. This will prove that you are telling the truth, and you will not die.” To this they agreed.
GEN.42.21	Speaking among themselves, they said, “Clearly we are being punished because of what we did to Joseph long ago. We saw his anguish when he pleaded for his life, but we wouldn’t listen. That’s why we’re in this trouble.”
GEN.42.22	“Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy?” Reuben asked. “But you wouldn’t listen. And now we have to answer for his blood!”
GEN.42.23	Of course, they didn’t know that Joseph understood them, for he had been speaking to them through an interpreter. 
GEN.42.24	Now he turned away from them and began to weep. When he regained his composure, he spoke to them again. Then he chose Simeon from among them and had him tied up right before their eyes.
GEN.42.25	Joseph then ordered his servants to fill the men’s sacks with grain, but he also gave secret instructions to return each brother’s payment at the top of his sack. He also gave them supplies for their journey home. 
GEN.42.26	So the brothers loaded their donkeys with the grain and headed for home.
GEN.42.27	But when they stopped for the night and one of them opened his sack to get grain for his donkey, he found his money in the top of his sack. 
GEN.42.28	“Look!” he exclaimed to his brothers. “My money has been returned; it’s here in my sack!” Then their hearts sank. Trembling, they said to each other, “What has God done to us?”
GEN.42.29	When the brothers came to their father, Jacob, in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them. 
GEN.42.30	“The man who is governor of the land spoke very harshly to us,” they told him. “He accused us of being spies scouting the land. 
GEN.42.31	But we said, ‘We are honest men, not spies. 
GEN.42.32	We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One brother is no longer with us, and the youngest is at home with our father in the land of Canaan.’
GEN.42.33	“Then the man who is governor of the land told us, ‘This is how I will find out if you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take grain for your starving families and go on home. 
GEN.42.34	But you must bring your youngest brother back to me. Then I will know you are honest men and not spies. Then I will give you back your brother, and you may trade freely in the land.’”
GEN.42.35	As they emptied out their sacks, there in each man’s sack was the bag of money he had paid for the grain! The brothers and their father were terrified when they saw the bags of money. 
GEN.42.36	Jacob exclaimed, “You are robbing me of my children! Joseph is gone! Simeon is gone! And now you want to take Benjamin, too. Everything is going against me!”
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben said to his father, “You may kill my two sons if I don’t bring Benjamin back to you. I’ll be responsible for him, and I promise to bring him back.”
GEN.42.38	But Jacob replied, “My son will not go down with you. His brother Joseph is dead, and he is all I have left. If anything should happen to him on your journey, you would send this grieving, white-haired man to his grave.
GEN.43.1	But the famine continued to ravage the land of Canaan. 
GEN.43.2	When the grain they had brought from Egypt was almost gone, Jacob said to his sons, “Go back and buy us a little more food.”
GEN.43.3	But Judah said, “The man was serious when he warned us, ‘You won’t see my face again unless your brother is with you.’ 
GEN.43.4	If you send Benjamin with us, we will go down and buy more food. 
GEN.43.5	But if you don’t let Benjamin go, we won’t go either. Remember, the man said, ‘You won’t see my face again unless your brother is with you.’”
GEN.43.6	“Why were you so cruel to me?” Jacob
GEN.43.7	“The man kept asking us questions about our family,” they replied. “He asked, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ So we answered his questions. How could we know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”
GEN.43.8	Judah said to his father, “Send the boy with me, and we will be on our way. Otherwise we will all die of starvation—and not only we, but you and our little ones. 
GEN.43.9	I personally guarantee his safety. You may hold me responsible if I don’t bring him back to you. Then let me bear the blame forever. 
GEN.43.10	If we hadn’t wasted all this time, we could have gone and returned twice by now.”
GEN.43.11	So their father, Jacob, finally said to them, “If it can’t be avoided, then at least do this. Pack your bags with the best products of this land. Take them down to the man as gifts—balm, honey, gum, aromatic resin, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 
GEN.43.12	Also take double the money that was put back in your sacks, as it was probably someone’s mistake. 
GEN.43.13	Then take your brother, and go back to the man. 
GEN.43.14	May God Almighty
GEN.43.15	So the men packed Jacob’s gifts and double the money and headed off with Benjamin. They finally arrived in Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph. 
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the manager of his household, “These men will eat with me this noon. Take them inside the palace. Then go slaughter an animal, and prepare a big feast.” 
GEN.43.17	So the man did as Joseph told him and took them into Joseph’s palace.
GEN.43.18	The brothers were terrified when they saw that they were being taken into Joseph’s house. “It’s because of the money someone put in our sacks last time we were here,” they said. “He plans to pretend that we stole it. Then he will seize us, make us slaves, and take our donkeys.”
GEN.43.19	The brothers approached the manager of Joseph’s household and spoke to him at the entrance to the palace. 
GEN.43.20	“Sir,” they said, “we came to Egypt once before to buy food. 
GEN.43.21	But as we were returning home, we stopped for the night and opened our sacks. Then we discovered that each man’s money—the exact amount paid—was in the top of his sack! Here it is; we have brought it back with us. 
GEN.43.22	We also have additional money to buy more food. We have no idea who put our money in our sacks.”
GEN.43.23	“Relax. Don’t be afraid,” the household manager told them. “Your God, the God of your father, must have put this treasure into your sacks. I know I received your payment.” Then he released Simeon and brought him out to them.
GEN.43.24	The manager then led the men into Joseph’s palace. He gave them water to wash their feet and provided food for their donkeys. 
GEN.43.25	They were told they would be eating there, so they prepared their gifts for Joseph’s arrival at noon.
GEN.43.26	When Joseph came home, they gave him the gifts they had brought him, then bowed low to the ground before him. 
GEN.43.27	After greeting them, he asked, “How is your father, the old man you spoke about? Is he still alive?”
GEN.43.28	“Yes,” they replied. “Our father, your servant, is alive and well.” And they bowed low again.
GEN.43.29	Then Joseph looked at his brother Benjamin, the son of his own mother. “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” Joseph asked. “May God be gracious to you, my son.” 
GEN.43.30	Then Joseph hurried from the room because he was overcome with emotion for his brother. He went into his private room, where he broke down and wept. 
GEN.43.31	After washing his face, he came back out, keeping himself under control. Then he ordered, “Bring out the food!”
GEN.43.32	The waiters served Joseph at his own table, and his brothers were served at a separate table. The Egyptians who ate with Joseph sat at their own table, because Egyptians despise Hebrews and refuse to eat with them. 
GEN.43.33	Joseph told each of his brothers where to sit, and to their amazement, he seated them according to age, from oldest to youngest. 
GEN.43.34	And Joseph filled their plates with food from his own table, giving Benjamin five times as much as he gave the others. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
GEN.44.1	When his brothers were ready to leave, Joseph gave these instructions to his palace manager: “Fill each of their sacks with as much grain as they can carry, and put each man’s money back into his sack. 
GEN.44.2	Then put my personal silver cup at the top of the youngest brother’s sack, along with the money for his grain.” So the manager did as Joseph instructed him.
GEN.44.3	The brothers were up at dawn and were sent on their journey with their loaded donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	But when they had gone only a short distance and were barely out of the city, Joseph said to his palace manager, “Chase after them and stop them. When you catch up with them, ask them, ‘Why have you repaid my kindness with such evil? 
GEN.44.5	Why have you stolen my master’s silver cup,
GEN.44.6	When the palace manager caught up with the men, he spoke to them as he had been instructed.
GEN.44.7	“What are you talking about?” the brothers responded. “We are your servants and would never do such a thing! 
GEN.44.8	Didn’t we return the money we found in our sacks? We brought it back all the way from the land of Canaan. Why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house? 
GEN.44.9	If you find his cup with any one of us, let that man die. And all the rest of us, my lord, will be your slaves.”
GEN.44.10	“That’s fair,” the man replied. “But only the one who stole the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may go free.”
GEN.44.11	They all quickly took their sacks from the backs of their donkeys and opened them. 
GEN.44.12	The palace manager searched the brothers’ sacks, from the oldest to the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack! 
GEN.44.13	When the brothers saw this, they tore their clothing in despair. Then they loaded their donkeys again and returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	Joseph was still in his palace when Judah and his brothers arrived, and they fell to the ground before him. 
GEN.44.15	“What have you done?” Joseph demanded. “Don’t you know that a man like me can predict the future?”
GEN.44.16	Judah answered, “Oh, my lord, what can we say to you? How can we explain this? How can we prove our innocence? God is punishing us for our sins. My lord, we have all returned to be your slaves—all of us, not just our brother who had your cup in his sack.”
GEN.44.17	“No,” Joseph said. “I would never do such a thing! Only the man who stole the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may go back to your father in peace.”
GEN.44.18	Then Judah stepped forward and said, “Please, my lord, let your servant say just one word to you. Please, do not be angry with me, even though you are as powerful as Pharaoh himself.
GEN.44.19	“My lord, previously you asked us, your servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	And we responded, ‘Yes, my lord, we have a father who is an old man, and his youngest son is a child of his old age. His full brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother’s children, and his father loves him very much.’
GEN.44.21	“And you said to us, ‘Bring him here so I can see him with my own eyes.’ 
GEN.44.22	But we said to you, ‘My lord, the boy cannot leave his father, for his father would die.’ 
GEN.44.23	But you told us, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes with you, you will never see my face again.’
GEN.44.24	“So we returned to your servant, our father, and told him what you had said. 
GEN.44.25	Later, when he said, ‘Go back again and buy us more food,’ 
GEN.44.26	we replied, ‘We can’t go unless you let our youngest brother go with us. We’ll never get to see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’
GEN.44.27	“Then my father said to us, ‘As you know, my wife had two sons, 
GEN.44.28	and one of them went away and never returned. Doubtless he was torn to pieces by some wild animal. I have never seen him since. 
GEN.44.29	Now if you take his brother away from me, and any harm comes to him, you will send this grieving, white-haired man to his grave.
GEN.44.30	“And now, my lord, I cannot go back to my father without the boy. Our father’s life is bound up in the boy’s life. 
GEN.44.31	If he sees that the boy is not with us, our father will die. We, your servants, will indeed be responsible for sending that grieving, white-haired man to his grave. 
GEN.44.32	My lord, I guaranteed to my father that I would take care of the boy. I told him, ‘If I don’t bring him back to you, I will bear the blame forever.’
GEN.44.33	“So please, my lord, let me stay here as a slave instead of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	For how can I return to my father if the boy is not with me? I couldn’t bear to see the anguish this would cause my father!”
GEN.45.1	Joseph could stand it no longer. There were many people in the room, and he said to his attendants, “Out, all of you!” So he was alone with his brothers when he told them who he was. 
GEN.45.2	Then he broke down and wept. He wept so loudly the Egyptians could hear him, and word of it quickly carried to Pharaoh’s palace.
GEN.45.3	“I am Joseph!” he said to his brothers. “Is my father still alive?” But his brothers were speechless! They were stunned to realize that Joseph was standing there in front of them. 
GEN.45.4	“Please, come closer,” he said to them. So they came closer. And he said again, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into slavery in Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	But don’t be upset, and don’t be angry with yourselves for selling me to this place. It was God who sent me here ahead of you to preserve your lives. 
GEN.45.6	This famine that has ravaged the land for two years will last five more years, and there will be neither plowing nor harvesting. 
GEN.45.7	God has sent me ahead of you to keep you and your families alive and to preserve many survivors.
GEN.45.8	So it was God who sent me here, not you! And he is the one who made me an adviser
GEN.45.9	“Now hurry back to my father and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me master over all the land of Egypt. So come down to me immediately! 
GEN.45.10	You can live in the region of Goshen, where you can be near me with all your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and everything you own. 
GEN.45.11	I will take care of you there, for there are still five years of famine ahead of us. Otherwise you, your household, and all your animals will starve.’”
GEN.45.12	Then Joseph added, “Look! You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that I really am Joseph! 
GEN.45.13	Go tell my father of my honored position here in Egypt. Describe for him everything you have seen, and then bring my father here quickly.” 
GEN.45.14	Weeping with joy, he embraced Benjamin, and Benjamin did the same. 
GEN.45.15	Then Joseph kissed each of his brothers and wept over them, and after that they began talking freely with him.
GEN.45.16	The news soon reached Pharaoh’s palace: “Joseph’s brothers have arrived!” Pharaoh and his officials were all delighted to hear this.
GEN.45.17	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘This is what you must do: Load your pack animals, and hurry back to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.45.18	Then get your father and all of your families, and return here to me. I will give you the very best land in Egypt, and you will eat from the best that the land produces.’”
GEN.45.19	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Take wagons from the land of Egypt to carry your little children and your wives, and bring your father here. 
GEN.45.20	Don’t worry about your personal belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”
GEN.45.21	So the sons of Jacob
GEN.45.22	And he gave each of them new clothes—but to Benjamin he gave five changes of clothes and 300 pieces
GEN.45.23	He also sent his father ten male donkeys loaded with the finest products of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other supplies he would need on his journey.
GEN.45.24	So Joseph sent his brothers off, and as they left, he called after them, “Don’t quarrel about all this along the way!” 
GEN.45.25	And they left Egypt and returned to their father, Jacob, in the land of Canaan.
GEN.45.26	“Joseph is still alive!” they told him. “And he is governor of all the land of Egypt!” Jacob was stunned at the news—he couldn’t believe it. 
GEN.45.27	But when they repeated to Jacob everything Joseph had told them, and when he saw the wagons Joseph had sent to carry him, their father’s spirits revived.
GEN.45.28	Then Jacob exclaimed, “It must be true! My son Joseph is alive! I must go and see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	So Jacob
GEN.46.2	During the night God spoke to him in a vision. “Jacob! Jacob!” he called.
GEN.46.2	“Here I am,” Jacob replied.
GEN.46.3	“I am God,
GEN.46.4	I will go with you down to Egypt, and I will bring you back again. You will die in Egypt, but Joseph will be with you to close your eyes.”
GEN.46.5	So Jacob left Beersheba, and his sons took him to Egypt. They carried him and their little ones and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had provided for them. 
GEN.46.6	They also took all their livestock and all the personal belongings they had acquired in the land of Canaan. So Jacob and his entire family went to Egypt—
GEN.46.7	sons and grandsons, daughters and granddaughters—all his descendants.
GEN.46.8	These are the names of the descendants of Israel—the sons of Jacob—who went to Egypt:
GEN.46.8	Reuben was Jacob’s oldest son. 
GEN.46.9	The sons of Reuben were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
GEN.46.10	The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul. (Shaul’s mother was a Canaanite woman.)
GEN.46.11	The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
GEN.46.12	The sons of Judah were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (though Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
GEN.46.13	The sons of Issachar were Tola, Puah,
GEN.46.14	The sons of Zebulun were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
GEN.46.15	These were the sons of Leah and Jacob who were born in Paddan-aram, in addition to their daughter, Dinah. The number of Jacob’s descendants (male and female) through Leah was thirty-three.
GEN.46.16	The sons of Gad were Zephon,
GEN.46.17	The sons of Asher were Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. Beriah’s sons were Heber and Malkiel.
GEN.46.18	These were the sons of Zilpah, the servant given to Leah by her father, Laban. The number of Jacob’s descendants through Zilpah was sixteen.
GEN.46.19	The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.46.20	Joseph’s sons, born in the land of Egypt, were Manasseh and Ephraim. Their mother was Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On.
GEN.46.21	Benjamin’s sons were Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
GEN.46.22	These were the sons of Rachel and Jacob. The number of Jacob’s descendants through Rachel was fourteen.
GEN.46.23	The son of Dan was Hushim.
GEN.46.24	The sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
GEN.46.25	These were the sons of Bilhah, the servant given to Rachel by her father, Laban. The number of Jacob’s descendants through Bilhah was seven.
GEN.46.26	The total number of Jacob’s direct descendants who went with him to Egypt, not counting his sons’ wives, was sixty-six. 
GEN.46.27	In addition, Joseph had two sons
GEN.46.28	As they neared their destination, Jacob sent Judah ahead to meet Joseph and get directions to the region of Goshen. And when they finally arrived there, 
GEN.46.29	Joseph prepared his chariot and traveled to Goshen to meet his father, Jacob. When Joseph arrived, he embraced his father and wept, holding him for a long time. 
GEN.46.30	Finally, Jacob said to Joseph, “Now I am ready to die, since I have seen your face again and know you are still alive.”
GEN.46.31	And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s entire family, “I will go to Pharaoh and tell him, ‘My brothers and my father’s entire family have come to me from the land of Canaan. 
GEN.46.32	These men are shepherds, and they raise livestock. They have brought with them their flocks and herds and everything they own.’”
GEN.46.33	Then he said, “When Pharaoh calls for you and asks you about your occupation, 
GEN.46.34	you must tell him, ‘We, your servants, have raised livestock all our lives, as our ancestors have always done.’ When you tell him this, he will let you live here in the region of Goshen, for the Egyptians despise shepherds.”
GEN.47.1	Then Joseph went to see Pharaoh and told him, “My father and my brothers have arrived from the land of Canaan. They have come with all their flocks and herds and possessions, and they are now in the region of Goshen.”
GEN.47.2	Joseph took five of his brothers with him and presented them to Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.3	And Pharaoh asked the brothers, “What is your occupation?”
GEN.47.3	They replied, “We, your servants, are shepherds, just like our ancestors. 
GEN.47.4	We have come to live here in Egypt for a while, for there is no pasture for our flocks in Canaan. The famine is very severe there. So please, we request permission to live in the region of Goshen.”
GEN.47.5	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your father and brothers have joined you here, 
GEN.47.6	choose any place in the entire land of Egypt for them to live. Give them the best land of Egypt. Let them live in the region of Goshen. And if any of them have special skills, put them in charge of my livestock, too.”
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought in his father, Jacob, and presented him to Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
GEN.47.8	“How old are you?” Pharaoh asked him.
GEN.47.9	Jacob replied, “I have traveled this earth for 130 hard years. But my life has been short compared to the lives of my ancestors.” 
GEN.47.10	Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh again before leaving his court.
GEN.47.11	So Joseph assigned the best land of Egypt—the region of Rameses—to his father and his brothers, and he settled them there, just as Pharaoh had commanded. 
GEN.47.12	And Joseph provided food for his father and his brothers in amounts appropriate to the number of their dependents, including the smallest children.
GEN.47.13	Meanwhile, the famine became so severe that all the food was used up, and people were starving throughout the lands of Egypt and Canaan. 
GEN.47.14	By selling grain to the people, Joseph eventually collected all the money in Egypt and Canaan, and he put the money in Pharaoh’s treasury. 
GEN.47.15	When the people of Egypt and Canaan ran out of money, all the Egyptians came to Joseph. “Our money is gone!” they cried. “But please give us food, or we will die before your very eyes!”
GEN.47.16	Joseph replied, “Since your money is gone, bring me your livestock. I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.” 
GEN.47.17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph in exchange for food. In exchange for their horses, flocks of sheep and goats, herds of cattle, and donkeys, Joseph provided them with food for another year.
GEN.47.18	But that year ended, and the next year they came again and said, “We cannot hide the truth from you, my lord. Our money is gone, and all our livestock and cattle are yours. We have nothing left to give but our bodies and our land. 
GEN.47.19	Why should we die before your very eyes? Buy us and our land in exchange for food; we offer our land and ourselves as slaves for Pharaoh. Just give us grain so we may live and not die, and so the land does not become empty and desolate.”
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. All the Egyptians sold him their fields because the famine was so severe, and soon all the land belonged to Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.21	As for the people, he made them all slaves,
GEN.47.22	The only land he did not buy was the land belonging to the priests. They received an allotment of food directly from Pharaoh, so they didn’t need to sell their land.
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said to the people, “Look, today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh. I will provide you with seed so you can plant the fields. 
GEN.47.24	Then when you harvest it, one-fifth of your crop will belong to Pharaoh. You may keep the remaining four-fifths as seed for your fields and as food for you, your households, and your little ones.”
GEN.47.25	“You have saved our lives!” they exclaimed. “May it please you, my lord, to let us be Pharaoh’s servants.” 
GEN.47.26	Joseph then issued a decree still in effect in the land of Egypt, that Pharaoh should receive one-fifth of all the crops grown on his land. Only the land belonging to the priests was not given to Pharaoh.
GEN.47.27	Meanwhile, the people of Israel settled in the region of Goshen in Egypt. There they acquired property, and they were fruitful, and their population grew rapidly. 
GEN.47.28	Jacob lived for seventeen years after his arrival in Egypt, so he lived 147 years in all.
GEN.47.29	As the time of his death drew near, Jacob
GEN.47.30	When I die, please take my body out of Egypt and bury me with my ancestors.”
GEN.47.30	So Joseph promised, “I will do as you ask.”
GEN.47.31	“Swear that you will do it,” Jacob insisted. So Joseph gave his oath, and Jacob bowed humbly at the head of his bed.
GEN.48.1	One day not long after this, word came to Joseph, “Your father is failing rapidly.” So Joseph went to visit his father, and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
GEN.48.2	When Joseph arrived, Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to see you.” So Jacob
GEN.48.3	Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty
GEN.48.4	He said to me, ‘I will make you fruitful, and I will multiply your descendants. I will make you a multitude of nations. And I will give this land of Canaan to your descendants
GEN.48.5	“Now I am claiming as my own sons these two boys of yours, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born here in the land of Egypt before I arrived. They will be my sons, just as Reuben and Simeon are. 
GEN.48.6	But any children born to you in the future will be your own, and they will inherit land within the territories of their brothers Ephraim and Manasseh.
GEN.48.7	“Long ago, as I was returning from Paddan-aram,
GEN.48.8	Then Jacob looked over at the two boys. “Are these your sons?” he asked.
GEN.48.9	“Yes,” Joseph told him, “these are the sons God has given me here in Egypt.”
GEN.48.9	And Jacob said, “Bring them closer to me, so I can bless them.”
GEN.48.10	Jacob was half blind because of his age and could hardly see. So Joseph brought the boys close to him, and Jacob kissed and embraced them. 
GEN.48.11	Then Jacob said to Joseph, “I never thought I would see your face again, but now God has let me see your children, too!”
GEN.48.12	Joseph moved the boys, who were at their grandfather’s knees, and he bowed with his face to the ground. 
GEN.48.13	Then he positioned the boys in front of Jacob. With his right hand he directed Ephraim toward Jacob’s left hand, and with his left hand he put Manasseh at Jacob’s right hand. 
GEN.48.14	But Jacob crossed his arms as he reached out to lay his hands on the boys’ heads. He put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, though he was the younger boy, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, though he was the firstborn. 
GEN.48.15	Then he blessed Joseph and said,
GEN.48.15	“May the God before whom my grandfather Abraham
GEN.48.15	and my father, Isaac, walked—
GEN.48.15	the God who has been my shepherd
GEN.48.15	all my life, to this very day,
GEN.48.16	the Angel who has redeemed me from all harm—
GEN.48.16	may he bless these boys.
GEN.48.16	May they preserve my name
GEN.48.16	and the names of Abraham and Isaac.
GEN.48.16	And may their descendants multiply greatly
GEN.48.16	throughout the earth.”
GEN.48.17	But Joseph was upset when he saw that his father placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head. So Joseph lifted it to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. 
GEN.48.18	“No, my father,” he said. “This one is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”
GEN.48.19	But his father refused. “I know, my son; I know,” he replied. “Manasseh will also become a great people, but his younger brother will become even greater. And his descendants will become a multitude of nations.”
GEN.48.20	So Jacob blessed the boys that day with this blessing: “The people of Israel will use your names when they give a blessing. They will say, ‘May God make you as prosperous as Ephraim and Manasseh.’” In this way, Jacob put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
GEN.48.21	Then Jacob said to Joseph, “Look, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will take you back to Canaan, the land of your ancestors. 
GEN.48.22	And beyond what I have given your brothers, I am giving you an extra portion of the land
GEN.49.1	Then Jacob called together all his sons and said, “Gather around me, and I will tell you what will happen to each of you in the days to come.
GEN.49.2	“Come and listen, you sons of Jacob;
GEN.49.2	listen to Israel, your father.
GEN.49.3	“Reuben, you are my firstborn, my strength,
GEN.49.3	the child of my vigorous youth.
GEN.49.3	You are first in rank and first in power.
GEN.49.4	But you are as unruly as a flood,
GEN.49.4	and you will be first no longer.
GEN.49.4	For you went to bed with my wife;
GEN.49.4	you defiled my marriage couch.
GEN.49.5	“Simeon and Levi are two of a kind;
GEN.49.5	their weapons are instruments of violence.
GEN.49.6	May I never join in their meetings;
GEN.49.6	may I never be a party to their plans.
GEN.49.6	For in their anger they murdered men,
GEN.49.6	and they crippled oxen just for sport.
GEN.49.7	A curse on their anger, for it is fierce;
GEN.49.7	a curse on their wrath, for it is cruel.
GEN.49.7	I will scatter them among the descendants of Jacob;
GEN.49.7	I will disperse them throughout Israel.
GEN.49.8	“Judah, your brothers will praise you.
GEN.49.8	You will grasp your enemies by the neck.
GEN.49.8	All your relatives will bow before you.
GEN.49.9	Judah, my son, is a young lion
GEN.49.9	that has finished eating its prey.
GEN.49.9	Like a lion he crouches and lies down;
GEN.49.9	like a lioness—who dares to rouse him?
GEN.49.10	The scepter will not depart from Judah,
GEN.49.10	nor the ruler’s staff from his descendants,
GEN.49.10	until the coming of the one to whom it belongs,
GEN.49.10	the one whom all nations will honor.
GEN.49.11	He ties his foal to a grapevine,
GEN.49.11	the colt of his donkey to a choice vine.
GEN.49.11	He washes his clothes in wine,
GEN.49.11	his robes in the blood of grapes.
GEN.49.12	His eyes are darker than wine,
GEN.49.12	and his teeth are whiter than milk.
GEN.49.13	“Zebulun will settle by the seashore
GEN.49.13	and will be a harbor for ships;
GEN.49.13	his borders will extend to Sidon.
GEN.49.14	“Issachar is a sturdy donkey,
GEN.49.14	resting between two saddlepacks.
GEN.49.15	When he sees how good the countryside is
GEN.49.15	and how pleasant the land,
GEN.49.15	he will bend his shoulder to the load
GEN.49.15	and submit himself to hard labor.
GEN.49.16	“Dan will govern his people,
GEN.49.16	like any other tribe in Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan will be a snake beside the road,
GEN.49.17	a poisonous viper along the path
GEN.49.17	that bites the horse’s hooves
GEN.49.17	so its rider is thrown off.
GEN.49.18	I trust in you for salvation, O 
GEN.49.19	“Gad will be attacked by marauding bands,
GEN.49.19	but he will attack them when they retreat.
GEN.49.20	“Asher will dine on rich foods
GEN.49.20	and produce food fit for kings.
GEN.49.21	“Naphtali is a doe set free
GEN.49.21	that bears beautiful fawns.
GEN.49.22	“Joseph is the foal of a wild donkey,
GEN.49.22	the foal of a wild donkey at a spring—
GEN.49.22	one of the wild donkeys on the ridge.
GEN.49.23	Archers attacked him savagely;
GEN.49.23	they shot at him and harassed him.
GEN.49.24	But his bow remained taut,
GEN.49.24	and his arms were strengthened
GEN.49.24	by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,
GEN.49.24	by the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel.
GEN.49.25	May the God of your father help you;
GEN.49.25	may the Almighty bless you
GEN.49.25	with the blessings of the heavens above,
GEN.49.25	and blessings of the watery depths below,
GEN.49.25	and blessings of the breasts and womb.
GEN.49.26	May my fatherly blessings on you
GEN.49.26	surpass the blessings of my ancestors,
GEN.49.26	reaching to the heights of the eternal hills.
GEN.49.26	May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph,
GEN.49.26	who is a prince among his brothers.
GEN.49.27	“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf,
GEN.49.27	devouring his enemies in the morning
GEN.49.27	and dividing his plunder in the evening.”
GEN.49.28	These are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said as he told his sons good-bye. He blessed each one with an appropriate message.
GEN.49.29	Then Jacob instructed them, “Soon I will die and join my ancestors. Bury me with my father and grandfather in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite. 
GEN.49.30	This is the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite as a permanent burial site. 
GEN.49.31	There Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried. There Isaac and his wife, Rebekah, are buried. And there I buried Leah. 
GEN.49.32	It is the plot of land and the cave that my grandfather Abraham bought from the Hittites.”
GEN.49.33	When Jacob had finished this charge to his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, breathed his last, and joined his ancestors in death.
GEN.50.1	Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	Then Joseph told the physicians who served him to embalm his father’s body; so Jacob
GEN.50.3	The embalming process took the usual forty days. And the Egyptians mourned his death for seventy days.
GEN.50.4	When the period of mourning was over, Joseph approached Pharaoh’s advisers and said, “Please do me this favor and speak to Pharaoh on my behalf. 
GEN.50.5	Tell him that my father made me swear an oath. He said to me, ‘Listen, I am about to die. Take my body back to the land of Canaan, and bury me in the tomb I prepared for myself.’ So please allow me to go and bury my father. After his burial, I will return without delay.”
GEN.50.6	Pharaoh agreed to Joseph’s request. “Go and bury your father, as he made you promise,” he said. 
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went up to bury his father. He was accompanied by all of Pharaoh’s officials, all the senior members of Pharaoh’s household, and all the senior officers of Egypt. 
GEN.50.8	Joseph also took his entire household and his brothers and their households. But they left their little children and flocks and herds in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	A great number of chariots and charioteers accompanied Joseph.
GEN.50.10	When they arrived at the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan River, they held a very great and solemn memorial service, with a seven-day period of mourning for Joseph’s father. 
GEN.50.11	The local residents, the Canaanites, watched them mourning at the threshing floor of Atad. Then they renamed that place (which is near the Jordan) Abel-mizraim,
GEN.50.12	So Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them. 
GEN.50.13	They carried his body to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre. This is the cave that Abraham had bought as a permanent burial site from Ephron the Hittite.
GEN.50.14	After burying Jacob, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had accompanied him to his father’s burial. 
GEN.50.15	But now that their father was dead, Joseph’s brothers became fearful. “Now Joseph will show his anger and pay us back for all the wrong we did to him,” they said.
GEN.50.16	So they sent this message to Joseph: “Before your father died, he instructed us 
GEN.50.17	to say to you: ‘Please forgive your brothers for the great wrong they did to you—for their sin in treating you so cruelly.’ So we, the servants of the God of your father, beg you to forgive our sin.” When Joseph received the message, he broke down and wept. 
GEN.50.18	Then his brothers came and threw themselves down before Joseph. “Look, we are your slaves!” they said.
GEN.50.19	But Joseph replied, “Don’t be afraid of me. Am I God, that I can punish you? 
GEN.50.20	You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people. 
GEN.50.21	No, don’t be afraid. I will continue to take care of you and your children.” So he reassured them by speaking kindly to them.
GEN.50.22	So Joseph and his brothers and their families continued to live in Egypt. Joseph lived to the age of 110. 
GEN.50.23	He lived to see three generations of descendants of his son Ephraim, and he lived to see the birth of the children of Manasseh’s son Makir, whom he claimed as his own.
GEN.50.24	“Soon I will die,” Joseph told his brothers, “but God will surely come to help you and lead you out of this land of Egypt. He will bring you back to the land he solemnly promised to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”
GEN.50.25	Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath, and he said, “When God comes to help you and lead you back, you must take my bones with you.” 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died at the age of 110. The Egyptians embalmed him, and his body was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	These are the names of the sons of Israel (that is, Jacob) who moved to Egypt with their father, each with his family: 
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, 
EXO.1.4	Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	In all, Jacob had seventy
EXO.1.6	In time, Joseph and all of his brothers died, ending that entire generation. 
EXO.1.7	But their descendants, the Israelites, had many children and grandchildren. In fact, they multiplied so greatly that they became extremely powerful and filled the land.
EXO.1.8	Eventually, a new king came to power in Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph or what he had done. 
EXO.1.9	He said to his people, “Look, the people of Israel now outnumber us and are stronger than we are. 
EXO.1.10	We must make a plan to keep them from growing even more. If we don’t, and if war breaks out, they will join our enemies and fight against us. Then they will escape from the country.
EXO.1.11	So the Egyptians made the Israelites their slaves. They appointed brutal slave drivers over them, hoping to wear them down with crushing labor. They forced them to build the cities of Pithom and Rameses as supply centers for the king. 
EXO.1.12	But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more the Israelites multiplied and spread, and the more alarmed the Egyptians became. 
EXO.1.13	So the Egyptians worked the people of Israel without mercy. 
EXO.1.14	They made their lives bitter, forcing them to mix mortar and make bricks and do all the work in the fields. They were ruthless in all their demands.
EXO.1.15	Then Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, gave this order to the Hebrew midwives, Shiphrah and Puah: 
EXO.1.16	“When you help the Hebrew women as they give birth, watch as they deliver.
EXO.1.17	But because the midwives feared God, they refused to obey the king’s orders. They allowed the boys to live, too.
EXO.1.18	So the king of Egypt called for the midwives. “Why have you done this?” he demanded. “Why have you allowed the boys to live?”
EXO.1.19	“The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women,” the midwives replied. “They are more vigorous and have their babies so quickly that we cannot get there in time.”
EXO.1.20	So God was good to the midwives, and the Israelites continued to multiply, growing more and more powerful. 
EXO.1.21	And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
EXO.1.22	Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Throw every newborn Hebrew boy into the Nile River. But you may let the girls live.”
EXO.2.1	About this time, a man and woman from the tribe of Levi got married. 
EXO.2.2	The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She saw that he was a special baby and kept him hidden for three months. 
EXO.2.3	But when she could no longer hide him, she got a basket made of papyrus reeds and waterproofed it with tar and pitch. She put the baby in the basket and laid it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile River. 
EXO.2.4	The baby’s sister then stood at a distance, watching to see what would happen to him.
EXO.2.5	Soon Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe in the river, and her attendants walked along the riverbank. When the princess saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it for her. 
EXO.2.6	When the princess opened it, she saw the baby. The little boy was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This must be one of the Hebrew children,” she said.
EXO.2.7	Then the baby’s sister approached the princess. “Should I go and find one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?” she asked.
EXO.2.8	“Yes, do!” the princess replied. So the girl went and called the baby’s mother.
EXO.2.9	“Take this baby and nurse him for me,” the princess told the baby’s mother. “I will pay you for your help.” So the woman took her baby home and nursed him.
EXO.2.10	Later, when the boy was older, his mother brought him back to Pharaoh’s daughter, who adopted him as her own son. The princess named him Moses,
EXO.2.11	Many years later, when Moses had grown up, he went out to visit his own people, the Hebrews, and he saw how hard they were forced to work. During his visit, he saw an Egyptian beating one of his fellow Hebrews. 
EXO.2.12	After looking in all directions to make sure no one was watching, Moses killed the Egyptian and hid the body in the sand.
EXO.2.13	The next day, when Moses went out to visit his people again, he saw two Hebrew men fighting. “Why are you beating up your friend?” Moses said to the one who had started the fight.
EXO.2.14	The man replied, “Who appointed you to be our prince and judge? Are you going to kill me as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?”
EXO.2.14	Then Moses was afraid, thinking, “Everyone knows what I did.” 
EXO.2.15	And sure enough, Pharaoh heard what had happened, and he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in the land of Midian.
EXO.2.15	When Moses arrived in Midian, he sat down beside a well. 
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters who came as usual to draw water and fill the water troughs for their father’s flocks. 
EXO.2.17	But some other shepherds came and chased them away. So Moses jumped up and rescued the girls from the shepherds. Then he drew water for their flocks.
EXO.2.18	When the girls returned to Reuel, their father, he asked, “Why are you back so soon today?”
EXO.2.19	“An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds,” they answered. “And then he drew water for us and watered our flocks.”
EXO.2.20	“Then where is he?” their father asked. “Why did you leave him there? Invite him to come and eat with us.”
EXO.2.21	Moses accepted the invitation, and he settled there with him. In time, Reuel gave Moses his daughter Zipporah to be his wife. 
EXO.2.22	Later she gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom,
EXO.2.23	Years passed, and the king of Egypt died. But the Israelites continued to groan under their burden of slavery. They cried out for help, and their cry rose up to God. 
EXO.2.24	God heard their groaning, and he remembered his covenant promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	He looked down on the people of Israel and knew it was time to act.
EXO.3.1	One day Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro,
EXO.3.2	There the angel of the 
EXO.3.3	“This is amazing,” Moses said to himself. “Why isn’t that bush burning up? I must go see it.”
EXO.3.4	When the 
EXO.3.4	“Here I am!” Moses replied.
EXO.3.5	“Do not come any closer,” the 
EXO.3.6	I am the God of your father
EXO.3.7	Then the 
EXO.3.8	So I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and lead them out of Egypt into their own fertile and spacious land. It is a land flowing with milk and honey—the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live. 
EXO.3.9	Look! The cry of the people of Israel has reached me, and I have seen how harshly the Egyptians abuse them. 
EXO.3.10	Now go, for I am sending you to Pharaoh. You must lead my people Israel out of Egypt.”
EXO.3.11	But Moses protested to God, “Who am I to appear before Pharaoh? Who am I to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt?”
EXO.3.12	God answered, “I will be with you. And this is your sign that I am the one who has sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God at this very mountain.”
EXO.3.13	But Moses protested, “If I go to the people of Israel and tell them, ‘The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,’ they will ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what should I tell them?”
EXO.3.14	God replied to Moses, “
EXO.3.15	God also said to Moses, “Say this to the people of Israel: Yahweh,
EXO.3.15	This is my eternal name,
EXO.3.15	my name to remember for all generations.
EXO.3.16	“Now go and call together all the elders of Israel. Tell them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—has appeared to me. He told me, “I have been watching closely, and I see how the Egyptians are treating you. 
EXO.3.17	I have promised to rescue you from your oppression in Egypt. I will lead you to a land flowing with milk and honey—the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live.”’
EXO.3.18	“The elders of Israel will accept your message. Then you and the elders must go to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘The 
EXO.3.19	“But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand forces him.
EXO.3.20	So I will raise my hand and strike the Egyptians, performing all kinds of miracles among them. Then at last he will let you go. 
EXO.3.21	And I will cause the Egyptians to look favorably on you. They will give you gifts when you go so you will not leave empty-handed. 
EXO.3.22	Every Israelite woman will ask for articles of silver and gold and fine clothing from her Egyptian neighbors and from the foreign women in their houses. You will dress your sons and daughters with these, stripping the Egyptians of their wealth.”
EXO.4.1	But Moses protested again, “What if they won’t believe me or listen to me? What if they say, ‘The 
EXO.4.2	Then the 
EXO.4.2	“A shepherd’s staff,” Moses replied.
EXO.4.3	“Throw it down on the ground,” the 
EXO.4.4	Then the 
EXO.4.5	“Perform this sign,” the 
EXO.4.6	Then the 
EXO.4.7	“Now put your hand back into your cloak,” the 
EXO.4.8	The 
EXO.4.9	And if they don’t believe you or listen to you even after these two signs, then take some water from the Nile River and pour it out on the dry ground. When you do, the water from the Nile will turn to blood on the ground.”
EXO.4.10	But Moses pleaded with the 
EXO.4.11	Then the 
EXO.4.12	Now go! I will be with you as you speak, and I will instruct you in what to say.”
EXO.4.13	But Moses again pleaded, “Lord, please! Send anyone else.”
EXO.4.14	Then the 
EXO.4.15	Talk to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with both of you as you speak, and I will instruct you both in what to do. 
EXO.4.16	Aaron will be your spokesman to the people. He will be your mouthpiece, and you will stand in the place of God for him, telling him what to say. 
EXO.4.17	And take your shepherd’s staff with you, and use it to perform the miraculous signs I have shown you.”
EXO.4.18	So Moses went back home to Jethro, his father-in-law. “Please let me return to my relatives in Egypt,” Moses said. “I don’t even know if they are still alive.”
EXO.4.18	“Go in peace,” Jethro replied.
EXO.4.19	Before Moses left Midian, the 
EXO.4.20	So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and headed back to the land of Egypt. In his hand he carried the staff of God.
EXO.4.21	And the 
EXO.4.22	Then you will tell him, ‘This is what the 
EXO.4.23	I commanded you, “Let my son go, so he can worship me.” But since you have refused, I will now kill your firstborn son!’”
EXO.4.24	On the way to Egypt, at a place where Moses and his family had stopped for the night, the 
EXO.4.25	But Moses’ wife, Zipporah, took a flint knife and circumcised her son. She touched his feet
EXO.4.26	(When she said “a bridegroom of blood,” she was referring to the circumcision.) After that, the 
EXO.4.27	Now the 
EXO.4.28	Moses then told Aaron everything the 
EXO.4.29	Then Moses and Aaron returned to Egypt and called all the elders of Israel together. 
EXO.4.30	Aaron told them everything the 
EXO.4.31	Then the people of Israel were convinced that the 
EXO.5.1	After this presentation to Israel’s leaders, Moses and Aaron went and spoke to Pharaoh. They told him, “This is what the 
EXO.5.2	“Is that so?” retorted Pharaoh. “And who is the 
EXO.5.3	But Aaron and Moses persisted. “The God of the Hebrews has met with us,” they declared. “So let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness so we can offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.5.4	Pharaoh replied, “Moses and Aaron, why are you distracting the people from their tasks? Get back to work! 
EXO.5.5	Look, there are many of your people in the land, and you are stopping them from their work.”
EXO.5.6	That same day Pharaoh sent this order to the Egyptian slave drivers and the Israelite foremen: 
EXO.5.7	“Do not supply any more straw for making bricks. Make the people get it themselves! 
EXO.5.8	But still require them to make the same number of bricks as before. Don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy. That’s why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and offer sacrifices to our God.’ 
EXO.5.9	Load them down with more work. Make them sweat! That will teach them to listen to lies!”
EXO.5.10	So the slave drivers and foremen went out and told the people: “This is what Pharaoh says: I will not provide any more straw for you. 
EXO.5.11	Go and get it yourselves. Find it wherever you can. But you must produce just as many bricks as before!” 
EXO.5.12	So the people scattered throughout the land of Egypt in search of stubble to use as straw.
EXO.5.13	Meanwhile, the Egyptian slave drivers continued to push hard. “Meet your daily quota of bricks, just as you did when we provided you with straw!” they demanded. 
EXO.5.14	Then they whipped the Israelite foremen they had put in charge of the work crews. “Why haven’t you met your quotas either yesterday or today?” they demanded.
EXO.5.15	So the Israelite foremen went to Pharaoh and pleaded with him. “Please don’t treat your servants like this,” they begged. 
EXO.5.16	“We are given no straw, but the slave drivers still demand, ‘Make bricks!’ We are being beaten, but it isn’t our fault! Your own people are to blame!”
EXO.5.17	But Pharaoh shouted, “You’re just lazy! Lazy! That’s why you’re saying, ‘Let us go and offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.5.18	Now get back to work! No straw will be given to you, but you must still produce the full quota of bricks.”
EXO.5.19	The Israelite foremen could see that they were in serious trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce the number of bricks you make each day.” 
EXO.5.20	As they left Pharaoh’s court, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who were waiting outside for them. 
EXO.5.21	The foremen said to them, “May the 
EXO.5.22	Then Moses went back to the 
EXO.5.23	Ever since I came to Pharaoh as your spokesman, he has been even more brutal to your people. And you have done nothing to rescue them!”
EXO.6.1	Then the 
EXO.6.2	And God said to Moses, “I am Yahweh—‘the 
EXO.6.3	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El-Shaddai—‘God Almighty’
EXO.6.4	And I reaffirmed my covenant with them. Under its terms, I promised to give them the land of Canaan, where they were living as foreigners. 
EXO.6.5	You can be sure that I have heard the groans of the people of Israel, who are now slaves to the Egyptians. And I am well aware of my covenant with them.
EXO.6.6	“Therefore, say to the people of Israel: ‘I am the 
EXO.6.7	I will claim you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the 
EXO.6.8	I will bring you into the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as your very own possession. I am the 
EXO.6.9	So Moses told the people of Israel what the 
EXO.6.10	Then the 
EXO.6.11	“Go back to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and tell him to let the people of Israel leave his country.”
EXO.6.12	“But 
EXO.6.13	But the 
EXO.6.14	These are the ancestors of some of the clans of Israel:
EXO.6.14	The sons of Reuben, Israel’s oldest son, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. Their descendants became the clans of Reuben.
EXO.6.15	The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul. (Shaul’s mother was a Canaanite woman.) Their descendants became the clans of Simeon.
EXO.6.16	These are the descendants of Levi, as listed in their family records: The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. (Levi lived to be 137 years old.)
EXO.6.17	The descendants of Gershon included Libni and Shimei, each of whom became the ancestor of a clan.
EXO.6.18	The descendants of Kohath included Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. (Kohath lived to be 133 years old.)
EXO.6.19	The descendants of Merari included Mahli and Mushi.
EXO.6.19	These are the clans of the Levites, as listed in their family records.
EXO.6.20	Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she gave birth to his sons, Aaron and Moses. (Amram lived to be 137 years old.)
EXO.6.21	The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zicri.
EXO.6.22	The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
EXO.6.23	Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she gave birth to his sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
EXO.6.24	The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. Their descendants became the clans of Korah.
EXO.6.25	Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she gave birth to his son, Phinehas.
EXO.6.25	These are the ancestors of the Levite families, listed according to their clans.
EXO.6.26	The Aaron and Moses named in this list are the same ones to whom the 
EXO.6.27	It was Moses and Aaron who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, about leading the people of Israel out of Egypt.
EXO.6.28	When the 
EXO.6.29	he said to him, “I am the 
EXO.6.30	But Moses argued with the 
EXO.7.1	Then the 
EXO.7.2	Tell Aaron everything I command you, and Aaron must command Pharaoh to let the people of Israel leave his country. 
EXO.7.3	But I will make Pharaoh’s heart stubborn so I can multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.4	Even then Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you. So I will bring down my fist on Egypt. Then I will rescue my forces—my people, the Israelites—from the land of Egypt with great acts of judgment. 
EXO.7.5	When I raise my powerful hand and bring out the Israelites, the Egyptians will know that I am the 
EXO.7.6	So Moses and Aaron did just as the 
EXO.7.7	Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron was eighty-three when they made their demands to Pharaoh.
EXO.7.8	Then the 
EXO.7.9	“Pharaoh will demand, ‘Show me a miracle.’ When he does this, say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down in front of Pharaoh, and it will become a serpent.
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did what the 
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh called in his own wise men and sorcerers, and these Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their magic. 
EXO.7.12	They threw down their staffs, which also became serpents! But then Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. 
EXO.7.13	Pharaoh’s heart, however, remained hard. He still refused to listen, just as the 
EXO.7.14	Then the 
EXO.7.15	So go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes down to the river. Stand on the bank of the Nile and meet him there. Be sure to take along the staff that turned into a snake. 
EXO.7.16	Then announce to him, ‘The 
EXO.7.17	So this is what the 
EXO.7.18	The fish in it will die, and the river will stink. The Egyptians will not be able to drink any water from the Nile.’”
EXO.7.19	Then the 
EXO.7.20	So Moses and Aaron did just as the 
EXO.7.21	The fish in the river died, and the water became so foul that the Egyptians couldn’t drink it. There was blood everywhere throughout the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.22	But again the magicians of Egypt used their magic, and they, too, turned water into blood. So Pharaoh’s heart remained hard. He refused to listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the 
EXO.7.23	Pharaoh returned to his palace and put the whole thing out of his mind. 
EXO.7.24	Then all the Egyptians dug along the riverbank to find drinking water, for they couldn’t drink the water from the Nile.
EXO.7.25	Seven days passed from the time the 
EXO.8.1	Then the 
EXO.8.2	If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs across your entire land. 
EXO.8.3	The Nile River will swarm with frogs. They will come up out of the river and into your palace, even into your bedroom and onto your bed! They will enter the houses of your officials and your people. They will even jump into your ovens and your kneading bowls. 
EXO.8.4	Frogs will jump on you, your people, and all your officials.’”
EXO.8.5	Then the 
EXO.8.6	So Aaron raised his hand over the waters of Egypt, and frogs came up and covered the whole land! 
EXO.8.7	But the magicians were able to do the same thing with their magic. They, too, caused frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and begged, “Plead with the 
EXO.8.9	“You set the time!” Moses replied. “Tell me when you want me to pray for you, your officials, and your people. Then you and your houses will be rid of the frogs. They will remain only in the Nile River.”
EXO.8.10	“Do it tomorrow,” Pharaoh said.
EXO.8.10	“All right,” Moses replied, “it will be as you have said. Then you will know that there is no one like the 
EXO.8.11	The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials, and your people. They will remain only in the Nile River.”
EXO.8.12	So Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh’s palace, and Moses cried out to the 
EXO.8.13	And the 
EXO.8.14	The Egyptians piled them into great heaps, and a terrible stench filled the land. 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that relief had come, he became stubborn.
EXO.8.16	So the 
EXO.8.17	So Moses and Aaron did just as the 
EXO.8.18	Pharaoh’s magicians tried to do the same thing with their secret arts, but this time they failed. And the gnats covered everyone, people and animals alike.
EXO.8.19	“This is the finger of God!” the magicians exclaimed to Pharaoh. But Pharaoh’s heart remained hard. He wouldn’t listen to them, just as the 
EXO.8.20	Then the 
EXO.8.21	If you refuse, then I will send swarms of flies on you, your officials, your people, and all the houses. The Egyptian homes will be filled with flies, and the ground will be covered with them. 
EXO.8.22	But this time I will spare the region of Goshen, where my people live. No flies will be found there. Then you will know that I am the 
EXO.8.23	I will make a clear distinction between
EXO.8.24	And the 
EXO.8.25	Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron. “All right! Go ahead and offer sacrifices to your God,” he said. “But do it here in this land.”
EXO.8.26	But Moses replied, “That wouldn’t be right. The Egyptians detest the sacrifices that we offer to the 
EXO.8.27	We must take a three-day trip into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.8.28	“All right, go ahead,” Pharaoh replied. “I will let you go into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the 
EXO.8.29	Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the 
EXO.8.30	So Moses left Pharaoh’s palace and pleaded with the 
EXO.8.31	And the 
EXO.8.32	But Pharaoh again became stubborn and refused to let the people go.
EXO.9.1	“Go back to Pharaoh,” the 
EXO.9.2	If you continue to hold them and refuse to let them go, 
EXO.9.3	the hand of the 
EXO.9.4	But the 
EXO.9.5	The 
EXO.9.6	And the 
EXO.9.7	Pharaoh sent his officials to investigate, and they discovered that the Israelites had not lost a single animal! But even so, Pharaoh’s heart remained stubborn,
EXO.9.8	Then the 
EXO.9.9	The ashes will spread like fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, causing festering boils to break out on people and animals throughout the land.”
EXO.9.10	So they took soot from a brick kiln and went and stood before Pharaoh. As Pharaoh watched, Moses threw the soot into the air, and boils broke out on people and animals alike. 
EXO.9.11	Even the magicians were unable to stand before Moses, because the boils had broken out on them and all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	But the 
EXO.9.13	Then the 
EXO.9.14	If you don’t, I will send more plagues on you
EXO.9.15	By now I could have lifted my hand and struck you and your people with a plague to wipe you off the face of the earth. 
EXO.9.16	But I have spared you for a purpose—to show you my power
EXO.9.17	But you still lord it over my people and refuse to let them go. 
EXO.9.18	So tomorrow at this time I will send a hailstorm more devastating than any in all the history of Egypt. 
EXO.9.19	Quick! Order your livestock and servants to come in from the fields to find shelter. Any person or animal left outside will die when the hail falls.’”
EXO.9.20	Some of Pharaoh’s officials were afraid because of what the 
EXO.9.21	But those who paid no attention to the word of the 
EXO.9.22	Then the 
EXO.9.23	So Moses lifted his staff toward the sky, and the 
EXO.9.24	Never in all the history of Egypt had there been a storm like that, with such devastating hail and continuous lightning. 
EXO.9.25	It left all of Egypt in ruins. The hail struck down everything in the open field—people, animals, and plants alike. Even the trees were destroyed. 
EXO.9.26	The only place without hail was the region of Goshen, where the people of Israel lived.
EXO.9.27	Then Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he confessed. “The 
EXO.9.28	Please beg the 
EXO.9.29	“All right,” Moses replied. “As soon as I leave the city, I will lift my hands and pray to the 
EXO.9.30	But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the 
EXO.9.31	(All the flax and barley were ruined by the hail, because the barley had formed heads and the flax was budding. 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the emmer wheat were spared, because they had not yet sprouted from the ground.)
EXO.9.33	So Moses left Pharaoh’s court and went out of the city. When he lifted his hands to the 
EXO.9.34	But when Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had stopped, he and his officials sinned again, and Pharaoh again became stubborn.
EXO.9.35	Because his heart was hard, Pharaoh refused to let the people leave, just as the 
EXO.10.1	Then the 
EXO.10.2	I’ve also done it so you can tell your children and grandchildren about how I made a mockery of the Egyptians and about the signs I displayed among them—and so you will know that I am the 
EXO.10.3	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the 
EXO.10.4	If you refuse, watch out! For tomorrow I will bring a swarm of locusts on your country. 
EXO.10.5	They will cover the land so that you won’t be able to see the ground. They will devour what little is left of your crops after the hailstorm, including all the trees growing in the fields. 
EXO.10.6	They will overrun your palaces and the homes of your officials and all the houses in Egypt. Never in the history of Egypt have your ancestors seen a plague like this one!” And with that, Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
EXO.10.7	Pharaoh’s officials now came to Pharaoh and appealed to him. “How long will you let this man hold us hostage? Let the men go to worship the 
EXO.10.8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “All right,” he told them, “go and worship the 
EXO.10.9	Moses replied, “We will all go—young and old, our sons and daughters, and our flocks and herds. We must all join together in celebrating a festival to the 
EXO.10.10	Pharaoh retorted, “The 
EXO.10.11	Never! Only the men may go and worship the 
EXO.10.12	Then the 
EXO.10.13	So Moses raised his staff over Egypt, and the 
EXO.10.14	And the locusts swarmed over the whole land of Egypt, settling in dense swarms from one end of the country to the other. It was the worst locust plague in Egyptian history, and there has never been another one like it. 
EXO.10.15	For the locusts covered the whole country and darkened the land. They devoured every plant in the fields and all the fruit on the trees that had survived the hailstorm. Not a single leaf was left on the trees and plants throughout the land of Egypt.
EXO.10.16	Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron. “I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	“Forgive my sin, just this once, and plead with the 
EXO.10.18	So Moses left Pharaoh’s court and pleaded with the 
EXO.10.19	The 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	Then the 
EXO.10.22	So Moses lifted his hand to the sky, and a deep darkness covered the entire land of Egypt for three days. 
EXO.10.23	During all that time the people could not see each other, and no one moved. But there was light as usual where the people of Israel lived.
EXO.10.24	Finally, Pharaoh called for Moses. “Go and worship the 
EXO.10.25	“No,” Moses said, “you must provide us with animals for sacrifices and burnt offerings to the 
EXO.10.26	All our livestock must go with us, too; not a hoof can be left behind. We must choose our sacrifices for the 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	“Get out of here!” Pharaoh shouted at Moses. “I’m warning you. Never come back to see me again! The day you see my face, you will die!”
EXO.10.29	“Very well,” Moses replied. “I will never see your face again.”
EXO.11.1	Then the 
EXO.11.2	Tell all the Israelite men and women to ask their Egyptian neighbors for articles of silver and gold.” 
EXO.11.3	(Now the 
EXO.11.4	Moses had announced to Pharaoh, “This is what the 
EXO.11.5	All the firstborn sons will die in every family in Egypt, from the oldest son of Pharaoh, who sits on his throne, to the oldest son of his lowliest servant girl who grinds the flour. Even the firstborn of all the livestock will die. 
EXO.11.6	Then a loud wail will rise throughout the land of Egypt, a wail like no one has heard before or will ever hear again. 
EXO.11.7	But among the Israelites it will be so peaceful that not even a dog will bark. Then you will know that the 
EXO.11.8	All the officials of Egypt will run to me and fall to the ground before me. ‘Please leave!’ they will beg. ‘Hurry! And take all your followers with you.’ Only then will I go!” Then, burning with anger, Moses left Pharaoh.
EXO.11.9	Now the 
EXO.11.10	Moses and Aaron performed these miracles in Pharaoh’s presence, but the 
EXO.12.1	While the Israelites were still in the land of Egypt, the 
EXO.12.2	“From now on, this month will be the first month of the year for you. 
EXO.12.3	Announce to the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each family must choose a lamb or a young goat for a sacrifice, one animal for each household. 
EXO.12.4	If a family is too small to eat a whole animal, let them share with another family in the neighborhood. Divide the animal according to the size of each family and how much they can eat. 
EXO.12.5	The animal you select must be a one-year-old male, either a sheep or a goat, with no defects.
EXO.12.6	“Take special care of this chosen animal until the evening of the fourteenth day of this first month. Then the whole assembly of the community of Israel must slaughter their lamb or young goat at twilight. 
EXO.12.7	They are to take some of the blood and smear it on the sides and top of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the animal. 
EXO.12.8	That same night they must roast the meat over a fire and eat it along with bitter salad greens and bread made without yeast. 
EXO.12.9	Do not eat any of the meat raw or boiled in water. The whole animal—including the head, legs, and internal organs—must be roasted over a fire. 
EXO.12.10	Do not leave any of it until the next morning. Burn whatever is not eaten before morning.
EXO.12.11	“These are your instructions for eating this meal: Be fully dressed,
EXO.12.12	On that night I will pass through the land of Egypt and strike down every firstborn son and firstborn male animal in the land of Egypt. I will execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt, for I am the 
EXO.12.13	But the blood on your doorposts will serve as a sign, marking the houses where you are staying. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. This plague of death will not touch you when I strike the land of Egypt.
EXO.12.14	“This is a day to remember. Each year, from generation to generation, you must celebrate it as a special festival to the 
EXO.12.15	For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast. On the first day of the festival, remove every trace of yeast from your homes. Anyone who eats bread made with yeast during the seven days of the festival will be cut off from the community of Israel. 
EXO.12.16	On the first day of the festival and again on the seventh day, all the people must observe an official day for holy assembly. No work of any kind may be done on these days except in the preparation of food.
EXO.12.17	“Celebrate this Festival of Unleavened Bread, for it will remind you that I brought your forces out of the land of Egypt on this very day. This festival will be a permanent law for you; celebrate this day from generation to generation. 
EXO.12.18	The bread you eat must be made without yeast from the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month until the evening of the twenty-first day of that month. 
EXO.12.19	During those seven days, there must be no trace of yeast in your homes. Anyone who eats anything made with yeast during this week will be cut off from the community of Israel. These regulations apply both to the foreigners living among you and to the native-born Israelites. 
EXO.12.20	During those days you must not eat anything made with yeast. Wherever you live, eat only bread made without yeast.”
EXO.12.21	Then Moses called all the elders of Israel together and said to them, “Go, pick out a lamb or young goat for each of your families, and slaughter the Passover animal. 
EXO.12.22	Drain the blood into a basin. Then take a bundle of hyssop branches and dip it into the blood. Brush the hyssop across the top and sides of the doorframes of your houses. And no one may go out through the door until morning. 
EXO.12.23	For the 
EXO.12.24	“Remember, these instructions are a permanent law that you and your descendants must observe forever. 
EXO.12.25	When you enter the land the 
EXO.12.26	Then your children will ask, ‘What does this ceremony mean?’ 
EXO.12.27	And you will reply, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the 
EXO.12.28	So the people of Israel did just as the 
EXO.12.29	And that night at midnight, the 
EXO.12.30	Pharaoh and all his officials and all the people of Egypt woke up during the night, and loud wailing was heard throughout the land of Egypt. There was not a single house where someone had not died.
EXO.12.31	Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron during the night. “Get out!” he ordered. “Leave my people—and take the rest of the Israelites with you! Go and worship the 
EXO.12.32	Take your flocks and herds, as you said, and be gone. Go, but bless me as you leave.” 
EXO.12.33	All the Egyptians urged the people of Israel to get out of the land as quickly as possible, for they thought, “We will all die!”
EXO.12.34	The Israelites took their bread dough before yeast was added. They wrapped their kneading boards in their cloaks and carried them on their shoulders. 
EXO.12.35	And the people of Israel did as Moses had instructed; they asked the Egyptians for clothing and articles of silver and gold. 
EXO.12.36	The 
EXO.12.37	That night the people of Israel left Rameses and started for Succoth. There were about 600,000 men,
EXO.12.38	A rabble of non-Israelites went with them, along with great flocks and herds of livestock. 
EXO.12.39	For bread they baked flat cakes from the dough without yeast they had brought from Egypt. It was made without yeast because the people were driven out of Egypt in such a hurry that they had no time to prepare the bread or other food.
EXO.12.40	The people of Israel had lived in Egypt
EXO.12.41	In fact, it was on the last day of the 430th year that all the 
EXO.12.42	On this night the 
EXO.12.43	Then the 
EXO.12.44	But any slave who has been purchased may eat it if he has been circumcised. 
EXO.12.45	Temporary residents and hired servants may not eat it. 
EXO.12.46	Each Passover lamb must be eaten in one house. Do not carry any of its meat outside, and do not break any of its bones. 
EXO.12.47	The whole community of Israel must celebrate this Passover festival.
EXO.12.48	“If there are foreigners living among you who want to celebrate the 
EXO.12.49	This instruction applies to everyone, whether a native-born Israelite or a foreigner living among you.”
EXO.12.50	So all the people of Israel followed all the 
EXO.12.51	On that very day the 
EXO.13.1	Then the 
EXO.13.2	“Dedicate to me every firstborn among the Israelites. The first offspring to be born, of both humans and animals, belongs to me.”
EXO.13.3	So Moses said to the people, “This is a day to remember forever—the day you left Egypt, the place of your slavery. Today the 
EXO.13.4	On this day in early spring, in the month of Abib,
EXO.13.5	You must celebrate this event in this month each year after the 
EXO.13.6	For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast. Then on the seventh day, celebrate a feast to the 
EXO.13.7	Eat bread without yeast during those seven days. In fact, there must be no yeast bread or any yeast at all found within the borders of your land during this time.
EXO.13.8	“On the seventh day you must explain to your children, ‘I am celebrating what the 
EXO.13.9	This annual festival will be a visible sign to you, like a mark branded on your hand or your forehead. Let it remind you always to recite this teaching of the 
EXO.13.10	So observe the decree of this festival at the appointed time each year.
EXO.13.11	“This is what you must do when the 
EXO.13.12	you must present all firstborn sons and firstborn male animals to the 
EXO.13.13	A firstborn donkey may be bought back from the 
EXO.13.14	“And in the future, your children will ask you, ‘What does all this mean?’ Then you will tell them, ‘With the power of his mighty hand, the 
EXO.13.15	Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, so the 
EXO.13.16	This ceremony will be like a mark branded on your hand or your forehead. It is a reminder that the power of the 
EXO.13.17	When Pharaoh finally let the people go, God did not lead them along the main road that runs through Philistine territory, even though that was the shortest route to the Promised Land. God said, “If the people are faced with a battle, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.” 
EXO.13.18	So God led them in a roundabout way through the wilderness toward the Red Sea.
EXO.13.19	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear to do this. He said, “God will certainly come to help you. When he does, you must take my bones with you from this place.”
EXO.13.20	The Israelites left Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness. 
EXO.13.21	The 
EXO.13.22	And the 
EXO.14.1	Then the 
EXO.14.2	“Order the Israelites to turn back and camp by Pi-hahiroth between Migdol and the sea. Camp there along the shore, across from Baal-zephon. 
EXO.14.3	Then Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are confused. They are trapped in the wilderness!’ 
EXO.14.4	And once again I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will chase after you.
EXO.14.5	When word reached the king of Egypt that the Israelites had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds. “What have we done, letting all those Israelite slaves get away?” they asked. 
EXO.14.6	So Pharaoh harnessed his chariot and called up his troops. 
EXO.14.7	He took with him 600 of Egypt’s best chariots, along with the rest of the chariots of Egypt, each with its commander. 
EXO.14.8	The 
EXO.14.9	The Egyptians chased after them with all the forces in Pharaoh’s army—all his horses and chariots, his charioteers, and his troops. The Egyptians caught up with the people of Israel as they were camped beside the shore near Pi-hahiroth, across from Baal-zephon.
EXO.14.10	As Pharaoh approached, the people of Israel looked up and panicked when they saw the Egyptians overtaking them. They cried out to the 
EXO.14.11	and they said to Moses, “Why did you bring us out here to die in the wilderness? Weren’t there enough graves for us in Egypt? What have you done to us? Why did you make us leave Egypt? 
EXO.14.12	Didn’t we tell you this would happen while we were still in Egypt? We said, ‘Leave us alone! Let us be slaves to the Egyptians. It’s better to be a slave in Egypt than a corpse in the wilderness!’”
EXO.14.13	But Moses told the people, “Don’t be afraid. Just stand still and watch the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	Then the 
EXO.14.16	Pick up your staff and raise your hand over the sea. Divide the water so the Israelites can walk through the middle of the sea on dry ground. 
EXO.14.17	And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will charge in after the Israelites. My great glory will be displayed through Pharaoh and his troops, his chariots, and his charioteers. 
EXO.14.18	When my glory is displayed through them, all Egypt will see my glory and know that I am the 
EXO.14.19	Then the angel of God, who had been leading the people of Israel, moved to the rear of the camp. The pillar of cloud also moved from the front and stood behind them. 
EXO.14.20	The cloud settled between the Egyptian and Israelite camps. As darkness fell, the cloud turned to fire, lighting up the night. But the Egyptians and Israelites did not approach each other all night.
EXO.14.21	Then Moses raised his hand over the sea, and the 
EXO.14.22	So the people of Israel walked through the middle of the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on each side!
EXO.14.23	Then the Egyptians—all of Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and charioteers—chased them into the middle of the sea. 
EXO.14.24	But just before dawn the 
EXO.14.25	He twisted
EXO.14.26	When all the Israelites had reached the other side, the 
EXO.14.27	So as the sun began to rise, Moses raised his hand over the sea, and the water rushed back into its usual place. The Egyptians tried to escape, but the 
EXO.14.28	Then the waters returned and covered all the chariots and charioteers—the entire army of Pharaoh. Of all the Egyptians who had chased the Israelites into the sea, not a single one survived.
EXO.14.29	But the people of Israel had walked through the middle of the sea on dry ground, as the water stood up like a wall on both sides. 
EXO.14.30	That is how the 
EXO.14.31	When the people of Israel saw the mighty power that the 
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the 
EXO.15.1	“I will sing to the 
EXO.15.1	for he has triumphed gloriously;
EXO.15.1	he has hurled both horse and rider
EXO.15.1	into the sea.
EXO.15.2	The 
EXO.15.2	he has given me victory.
EXO.15.2	This is my God, and I will praise him—
EXO.15.2	my father’s God, and I will exalt him!
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.3	Yahweh
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh’s chariots and army
EXO.15.4	he has hurled into the sea.
EXO.15.4	The finest of Pharaoh’s officers
EXO.15.4	are drowned in the Red Sea.
EXO.15.5	The deep waters gushed over them;
EXO.15.5	they sank to the bottom like a stone.
EXO.15.6	“Your right hand, O 
EXO.15.6	is glorious in power.
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, O 
EXO.15.6	smashes the enemy.
EXO.15.7	In the greatness of your majesty,
EXO.15.7	you overthrow those who rise against you.
EXO.15.7	You unleash your blazing fury;
EXO.15.7	it consumes them like straw.
EXO.15.8	At the blast of your breath,
EXO.15.8	the waters piled up!
EXO.15.8	The surging waters stood straight like a wall;
EXO.15.8	in the heart of the sea the deep waters became hard.
EXO.15.9	“The enemy boasted, ‘I will chase them
EXO.15.9	and catch up with them.
EXO.15.9	I will plunder them
EXO.15.9	and consume them.
EXO.15.9	I will flash my sword;
EXO.15.9	my powerful hand will destroy them.’
EXO.15.10	But you blew with your breath,
EXO.15.10	and the sea covered them.
EXO.15.10	They sank like lead
EXO.15.10	in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	“Who is like you among the gods, O 
EXO.15.11	glorious in holiness,
EXO.15.11	awesome in splendor,
EXO.15.11	performing great wonders?
EXO.15.12	You raised your right hand,
EXO.15.12	and the earth swallowed our enemies.
EXO.15.13	“With your unfailing love you lead
EXO.15.13	the people you have redeemed.
EXO.15.13	In your might, you guide them
EXO.15.13	to your sacred home.
EXO.15.14	The peoples hear and tremble;
EXO.15.14	anguish grips those who live in Philistia.
EXO.15.15	The leaders of Edom are terrified;
EXO.15.15	the nobles of Moab tremble.
EXO.15.15	All who live in Canaan melt away;
EXO.15.16	terror and dread fall upon them.
EXO.15.16	The power of your arm
EXO.15.16	makes them lifeless as stone
EXO.15.16	until your people pass by, O 
EXO.15.16	until the people you purchased pass by.
EXO.15.17	You will bring them in and plant them on your own mountain—
EXO.15.17	the place, O 
EXO.15.17	the sanctuary, O Lord, that your hands have established.
EXO.15.18	The 
EXO.15.19	When Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and charioteers rushed into the sea, the 
EXO.15.20	Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine and led all the women as they played their tambourines and danced. 
EXO.15.21	And Miriam sang this song:
EXO.15.21	“Sing to the 
EXO.15.21	for he has triumphed gloriously;
EXO.15.21	he has hurled both horse and rider
EXO.15.21	into the sea.”
EXO.15.22	Then Moses led the people of Israel away from the Red Sea, and they moved out into the desert of Shur. They traveled in this desert for three days without finding any water. 
EXO.15.23	When they came to the oasis of Marah, the water was too bitter to drink. So they called the place Marah (which means “bitter”).
EXO.15.24	Then the people complained and turned against Moses. “What are we going to drink?” they demanded. 
EXO.15.25	So Moses cried out to the 
EXO.15.25	It was there at Marah that the 
EXO.15.26	He said, “If you will listen carefully to the voice of the 
EXO.15.27	After leaving Marah, the Israelites traveled on to the oasis of Elim, where they found twelve springs and seventy palm trees. They camped there beside the water.
EXO.16.1	Then the whole community of Israel set out from Elim and journeyed into the wilderness of Sin,
EXO.16.2	There, too, the whole community of Israel complained about Moses and Aaron.
EXO.16.3	“If only the 
EXO.16.4	Then the 
EXO.16.5	On the sixth day they will gather food, and when they prepare it, there will be twice as much as usual.”
EXO.16.6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, “By evening you will realize it was the 
EXO.16.7	In the morning you will see the glory of the 
EXO.16.8	Then Moses added, “The 
EXO.16.9	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Announce this to the entire community of Israel: ‘Present yourselves before the 
EXO.16.10	And as Aaron spoke to the whole community of Israel, they looked out toward the wilderness. There they could see the awesome glory of the 
EXO.16.11	Then the 
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the Israelites’ complaints. Now tell them, ‘In the evening you will have meat to eat, and in the morning you will have all the bread you want. Then you will know that I am the 
EXO.16.13	That evening vast numbers of quail flew in and covered the camp. And the next morning the area around the camp was wet with dew. 
EXO.16.14	When the dew evaporated, a flaky substance as fine as frost blanketed the ground. 
EXO.16.15	The Israelites were puzzled when they saw it. “What is it?” they asked each other. They had no idea what it was.
EXO.16.15	And Moses told them, “It is the food the 
EXO.16.16	These are the 
EXO.16.17	So the people of Israel did as they were told. Some gathered a lot, some only a little. 
EXO.16.18	But when they measured it out,
EXO.16.19	Then Moses told them, “Do not keep any of it until morning.” 
EXO.16.20	But some of them didn’t listen and kept some of it until morning. But by then it was full of maggots and had a terrible smell. Moses was very angry with them.
EXO.16.21	After this the people gathered the food morning by morning, each family according to its need. And as the sun became hot, the flakes they had not picked up melted and disappeared. 
EXO.16.22	On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much as usual—four quarts
EXO.16.23	He told them, “This is what the 
EXO.16.24	So they put some aside until morning, just as Moses had commanded. And in the morning the leftover food was wholesome and good, without maggots or odor. 
EXO.16.25	Moses said, “Eat this food today, for today is a Sabbath day dedicated to the 
EXO.16.26	You may gather the food for six days, but the seventh day is the Sabbath. There will be no food on the ground that day.”
EXO.16.27	Some of the people went out anyway on the seventh day, but they found no food. 
EXO.16.28	The 
EXO.16.29	They must realize that the Sabbath is the 
EXO.16.30	So the people did not gather any food on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	The Israelites called the food manna.
EXO.16.32	Then Moses said, “This is what the 
EXO.16.33	Moses said to Aaron, “Get a jar and fill it with two quarts of manna. Then put it in a sacred place before the 
EXO.16.34	Aaron did just as the 
EXO.16.35	So the people of Israel ate manna for forty years until they arrived at the land where they would settle. They ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
EXO.16.36	The container used to measure the manna was an omer, which was one-tenth of an ephah; it held about two quarts.
EXO.17.1	At the 
EXO.17.2	So once more the people complained against Moses. “Give us water to drink!” they demanded.
EXO.17.2	“Quiet!” Moses replied. “Why are you complaining against me? And why are you testing the 
EXO.17.3	But tormented by thirst, they continued to argue with Moses. “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Are you trying to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?”
EXO.17.4	Then Moses cried out to the 
EXO.17.5	The 
EXO.17.6	I will stand before you on the rock at Mount Sinai.
EXO.17.7	Moses named the place Massah (which means “test”) and Meribah (which means “arguing”) because the people of Israel argued with Moses and tested the 
EXO.17.8	While the people of Israel were still at Rephidim, the warriors of Amalek attacked them. 
EXO.17.9	Moses commanded Joshua, “Choose some men to go out and fight the army of Amalek for us. Tomorrow, I will stand at the top of the hill, holding the staff of God in my hand.”
EXO.17.10	So Joshua did what Moses had commanded and fought the army of Amalek. Meanwhile, Moses, Aaron, and Hur climbed to the top of a nearby hill. 
EXO.17.11	As long as Moses held up the staff in his hand, the Israelites had the advantage. But whenever he dropped his hand, the Amalekites gained the advantage. 
EXO.17.12	Moses’ arms soon became so tired he could no longer hold them up. So Aaron and Hur found a stone for him to sit on. Then they stood on each side of Moses, holding up his hands. So his hands held steady until sunset. 
EXO.17.13	As a result, Joshua overwhelmed the army of Amalek in battle.
EXO.17.14	After the victory, the 
EXO.17.15	Moses built an altar there and named it Yahweh-Nissi (which means “the 
EXO.17.16	He said, “They have raised their fist against the 
EXO.18.1	Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about everything God had done for Moses and his people, the Israelites. He heard especially about how the 
EXO.18.2	Earlier, Moses had sent his wife, Zipporah, and his two sons back to Jethro, who had taken them in. 
EXO.18.3	(Moses’ first son was named Gershom,
EXO.18.4	His second son was named Eliezer,
EXO.18.5	Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, now came to visit Moses in the wilderness. He brought Moses’ wife and two sons with him, and they arrived while Moses and the people were camped near the mountain of God. 
EXO.18.6	Jethro had sent a message to Moses, saying, “I, Jethro, your father-in-law, am coming to see you with your wife and your two sons.”
EXO.18.7	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law. He bowed low and kissed him. They asked about each other’s welfare and then went into Moses’ tent. 
EXO.18.8	Moses told his father-in-law everything the 
EXO.18.9	Jethro was delighted when he heard about all the good things the 
EXO.18.10	“Praise the 
EXO.18.11	I know now that the 
EXO.18.12	Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God. Aaron and all the elders of Israel came out and joined him in a sacrificial meal in God’s presence.
EXO.18.13	The next day, Moses took his seat to hear the people’s disputes against each other. They waited before him from morning till evening.
EXO.18.14	When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he asked, “What are you really accomplishing here? Why are you trying to do all this alone while everyone stands around you from morning till evening?”
EXO.18.15	Moses replied, “Because the people come to me to get a ruling from God. 
EXO.18.16	When a dispute arises, they come to me, and I am the one who settles the case between the quarreling parties. I inform the people of God’s decrees and give them his instructions.”
EXO.18.17	“This is not good!” Moses’ father-in-law exclaimed. 
EXO.18.18	“You’re going to wear yourself out—and the people, too. This job is too heavy a burden for you to handle all by yourself. 
EXO.18.19	Now listen to me, and let me give you a word of advice, and may God be with you. You should continue to be the people’s representative before God, bringing their disputes to him. 
EXO.18.20	Teach them God’s decrees, and give them his instructions. Show them how to conduct their lives. 
EXO.18.21	But select from all the people some capable, honest men who fear God and hate bribes. Appoint them as leaders over groups of one thousand, one hundred, fifty, and ten. 
EXO.18.22	They should always be available to solve the people’s common disputes, but have them bring the major cases to you. Let the leaders decide the smaller matters themselves. They will help you carry the load, making the task easier for you. 
EXO.18.23	If you follow this advice, and if God commands you to do so, then you will be able to endure the pressures, and all these people will go home in peace.”
EXO.18.24	Moses listened to his father-in-law’s advice and followed his suggestions. 
EXO.18.25	He chose capable men from all over Israel and appointed them as leaders over the people. He put them in charge of groups of one thousand, one hundred, fifty, and ten. 
EXO.18.26	These men were always available to solve the people’s common disputes. They brought the major cases to Moses, but they took care of the smaller matters themselves.
EXO.18.27	Soon after this, Moses said good-bye to his father-in-law, who returned to his own land.
EXO.19.1	Exactly two months after the Israelites left Egypt,
EXO.19.2	After breaking camp at Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai and set up camp there at the base of Mount Sinai.
EXO.19.3	Then Moses climbed the mountain to appear before God. The 
EXO.19.4	‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians. You know how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. 
EXO.19.5	Now if you will obey me and keep my covenant, you will be my own special treasure from among all the peoples on earth; for all the earth belongs to me. 
EXO.19.6	And you will be my kingdom of priests, my holy nation.’ This is the message you must give to the people of Israel.”
EXO.19.7	So Moses returned from the mountain and called together the elders of the people and told them everything the 
EXO.19.8	And all the people responded together, “We will do everything the 
EXO.19.9	Then the 
EXO.19.9	Moses told the 
EXO.19.10	Then the 
EXO.19.11	Be sure they are ready on the third day, for on that day the 
EXO.19.12	Mark off a boundary all around the mountain. Warn the people, ‘Be careful! Do not go up on the mountain or even touch its boundaries. Anyone who touches the mountain will certainly be put to death. 
EXO.19.13	No hand may touch the person or animal that crosses the boundary; instead, stone them or shoot them with arrows. They must be put to death.’ However, when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast, then the people may go up on the mountain.
EXO.19.14	So Moses went down to the people. He consecrated them for worship, and they washed their clothes. 
EXO.19.15	He told them, “Get ready for the third day, and until then abstain from having sexual intercourse.”
EXO.19.16	On the morning of the third day, thunder roared and lightning flashed, and a dense cloud came down on the mountain. There was a long, loud blast from a ram’s horn, and all the people trembled. 
EXO.19.17	Moses led them out from the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.19.18	All of Mount Sinai was covered with smoke because the 
EXO.19.19	As the blast of the ram’s horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God thundered his reply. 
EXO.19.20	The 
EXO.19.21	Then the 
EXO.19.22	Even the priests who regularly come near to the 
EXO.19.23	“But 
EXO.19.24	But the 
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down to the people and told them what the 
EXO.20.1	Then God gave the people all these instructions
EXO.20.2	“I am the 
EXO.20.3	“You must not have any other god but me.
EXO.20.4	“You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea. 
EXO.20.5	You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the 
EXO.20.6	But I lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those
EXO.20.7	“You must not misuse the name of the 
EXO.20.8	“Remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. 
EXO.20.9	You have six days each week for your ordinary work, 
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the 
EXO.20.11	For in six days the 
EXO.20.12	“Honor your father and mother. Then you will live a long, full life in the land the 
EXO.20.13	“You must not murder.
EXO.20.14	“You must not commit adultery.
EXO.20.15	“You must not steal.
EXO.20.16	“You must not testify falsely against your neighbor.
EXO.20.17	“You must not covet your neighbor’s house. You must not covet your neighbor’s wife, male or female servant, ox or donkey, or anything else that belongs to your neighbor.”
EXO.20.18	When the people heard the thunder and the loud blast of the ram’s horn, and when they saw the flashes of lightning and the smoke billowing from the mountain, they stood at a distance, trembling with fear.
EXO.20.19	And they said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen. But don’t let God speak directly to us, or we will die!”
EXO.20.20	“Don’t be afraid,” Moses answered them, “for God has come in this way to test you, and so that your fear of him will keep you from sinning!”
EXO.20.21	As the people stood in the distance, Moses approached the dark cloud where God was.
EXO.20.22	And the 
EXO.20.23	Remember, you must not make any idols of silver or gold to rival me.
EXO.20.24	“Build for me an altar made of earth, and offer your sacrifices to me—your burnt offerings and peace offerings, your sheep and goats, and your cattle. Build my altar wherever I cause my name to be remembered, and I will come to you and bless you. 
EXO.20.25	If you use stones to build my altar, use only natural, uncut stones. Do not shape the stones with a tool, for that would make the altar unfit for holy use. 
EXO.20.26	And do not approach my altar by going up steps. If you do, someone might look up under your clothing and see your nakedness.
EXO.21.1	“These are the regulations you must present to Israel.
EXO.21.2	“If you buy a Hebrew slave, he may serve for no more than six years. Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom. 
EXO.21.3	If he was single when he became your slave, he shall leave single. But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife must be freed with him.
EXO.21.4	“If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave and they had sons or daughters, then only the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master. 
EXO.21.5	But the slave may declare, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children. I don’t want to go free.’ 
EXO.21.6	If he does this, his master must present him before God.
EXO.21.7	“When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. 
EXO.21.8	If she does not satisfy her owner, he must allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. 
EXO.21.9	But if the slave’s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave but as a daughter.
EXO.21.10	“If a man who has married a slave wife takes another wife for himself, he must not neglect the rights of the first wife to food, clothing, and sexual intimacy. 
EXO.21.11	If he fails in any of these three obligations, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.
EXO.21.12	“Anyone who assaults and kills another person must be put to death. 
EXO.21.13	But if it was simply an accident permitted by God, I will appoint a place of refuge where the slayer can run for safety. 
EXO.21.14	However, if someone deliberately kills another person, then the slayer must be dragged even from my altar and be put to death.
EXO.21.15	“Anyone who strikes father or mother must be put to death.
EXO.21.16	“Kidnappers must be put to death, whether they are caught in possession of their victims or have already sold them as slaves.
EXO.21.17	“Anyone who dishonors
EXO.21.18	“Now suppose two men quarrel, and one hits the other with a stone or fist, and the injured person does not die but is confined to bed. 
EXO.21.19	If he is later able to walk outside again, even with a crutch, the assailant will not be punished but must compensate his victim for lost wages and provide for his full recovery.
EXO.21.20	“If a man beats his male or female slave with a club and the slave dies as a result, the owner must be punished. 
EXO.21.21	But if the slave recovers within a day or two, then the owner shall not be punished, since the slave is his property.
EXO.21.22	“Now suppose two men are fighting, and in the process they accidentally strike a pregnant woman so she gives birth prematurely.
EXO.21.23	But if there is further injury, the punishment must match the injury: a life for a life, 
EXO.21.24	an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot, 
EXO.21.25	a burn for a burn, a wound for a wound, a bruise for a bruise.
EXO.21.26	“If a man hits his male or female slave in the eye and the eye is blinded, he must let the slave go free to compensate for the eye. 
EXO.21.27	And if a man knocks out the tooth of his male or female slave, he must let the slave go free to compensate for the tooth.
EXO.21.28	“If an ox
EXO.21.29	But suppose the ox had a reputation for goring, and the owner had been informed but failed to keep it under control. If the ox then kills someone, it must be stoned, and the owner must also be put to death. 
EXO.21.30	However, the dead person’s relatives may accept payment to compensate for the loss of life. The owner of the ox may redeem his life by paying whatever is demanded.
EXO.21.31	“The same regulation applies if the ox gores a boy or a girl. 
EXO.21.32	But if the ox gores a slave, either male or female, the animal’s owner must pay the slave’s owner thirty silver coins,
EXO.21.33	“Suppose someone digs or uncovers a pit and fails to cover it, and then an ox or a donkey falls into it. 
EXO.21.34	The owner of the pit must pay full compensation to the owner of the animal, but then he gets to keep the dead animal.
EXO.21.35	“If someone’s ox injures a neighbor’s ox and the injured ox dies, then the two owners must sell the live ox and divide the price equally between them. They must also divide the dead animal. 
EXO.21.36	But if the ox had a reputation for goring, yet its owner failed to keep it under control, he must pay full compensation—a live ox for the dead one—but he may keep the dead ox.
EXO.22.1	“If someone steals an ox
EXO.22.2	“If a thief is caught in the act of breaking into a house and is struck and killed in the process, the person who killed the thief is not guilty of murder. 
EXO.22.3	But if it happens in daylight, the one who killed the thief is guilty of murder.
EXO.22.3	“A thief who is caught must pay in full for everything he stole. If he cannot pay, he must be sold as a slave to pay for his theft. 
EXO.22.4	If someone steals an ox or a donkey or a sheep and it is found in the thief’s possession, then the thief must pay double the value of the stolen animal.
EXO.22.5	“If an animal is grazing in a field or vineyard and the owner lets it stray into someone else’s field to graze, then the animal’s owner must pay compensation from the best of his own grain or grapes.
EXO.22.6	“If you are burning thornbushes and the fire gets out of control and spreads into another person’s field, destroying the sheaves or the uncut grain or the whole crop, the one who started the fire must pay for the lost crop.
EXO.22.7	“Suppose someone leaves money or goods with a neighbor for safekeeping, and they are stolen from the neighbor’s house. If the thief is caught, the compensation is double the value of what was stolen. 
EXO.22.8	But if the thief is not caught, the neighbor must appear before God,
EXO.22.9	“Suppose there is a dispute between two people who both claim to own a particular ox, donkey, sheep, article of clothing, or any lost property. Both parties must come before God, and the person whom God declares
EXO.22.10	“Now suppose someone leaves a donkey, ox, sheep, or any other animal with a neighbor for safekeeping, but it dies or is injured or is taken away, and no one sees what happened. 
EXO.22.11	The neighbor must then take an oath in the presence of the 
EXO.22.12	But if the animal was indeed stolen, the guilty person must pay compensation to the owner. 
EXO.22.13	If it was torn to pieces by a wild animal, the remains of the carcass must be shown as evidence, and no compensation will be required.
EXO.22.14	“If someone borrows an animal from a neighbor and it is injured or dies when the owner is absent, the person who borrowed it must pay full compensation. 
EXO.22.15	But if the owner was present, no compensation is required. And no compensation is required if the animal was rented, for this loss is covered by the rental fee.
EXO.22.16	“If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged to anyone and has sex with her, he must pay the customary bride price and marry her. 
EXO.22.17	But if her father refuses to let him marry her, the man must still pay him an amount equal to the bride price of a virgin.
EXO.22.18	“You must not allow a sorceress to live.
EXO.22.19	“Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal must certainly be put to death.
EXO.22.20	“Anyone who sacrifices to any god other than the 
EXO.22.21	“You must not mistreat or oppress foreigners in any way. Remember, you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt.
EXO.22.22	“You must not exploit a widow or an orphan. 
EXO.22.23	If you exploit them in any way and they cry out to me, then I will certainly hear their cry. 
EXO.22.24	My anger will blaze against you, and I will kill you with the sword. Then your wives will be widows and your children fatherless.
EXO.22.25	“If you lend money to any of my people who are in need, do not charge interest as a money lender would. 
EXO.22.26	If you take your neighbor’s cloak as security for a loan, you must return it before sunset. 
EXO.22.27	This coat may be the only blanket your neighbor has. How can a person sleep without it? If you do not return it and your neighbor cries out to me for help, then I will hear, for I am merciful.
EXO.22.28	“You must not dishonor God or curse any of your rulers.
EXO.22.29	“You must not hold anything back when you give me offerings from your crops and your wine.
EXO.22.29	“You must give me your firstborn sons.
EXO.22.30	“You must also give me the firstborn of your cattle, sheep, and goats. But leave the newborn animal with its mother for seven days; then give it to me on the eighth day.
EXO.22.31	“You must be my holy people. Therefore, do not eat any animal that has been torn up and killed by wild animals. Throw it to the dogs.
EXO.23.1	“You must not pass along false rumors. You must not cooperate with evil people by lying on the witness stand.
EXO.23.2	“You must not follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you are called to testify in a dispute, do not be swayed by the crowd to twist justice. 
EXO.23.3	And do not slant your testimony in favor of a person just because that person is poor.
EXO.23.4	“If you come upon your enemy’s ox or donkey that has strayed away, take it back to its owner. 
EXO.23.5	If you see that the donkey of someone who hates you has collapsed under its load, do not walk by. Instead, stop and help.
EXO.23.6	“In a lawsuit, you must not deny justice to the poor.
EXO.23.7	“Be sure never to charge anyone falsely with evil. Never sentence an innocent or blameless person to death, for I never declare a guilty person to be innocent.
EXO.23.8	“Take no bribes, for a bribe makes you ignore something that you clearly see. A bribe makes even a righteous person twist the truth.
EXO.23.9	“You must not oppress foreigners. You know what it’s like to be a foreigner, for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt.
EXO.23.10	“Plant and harvest your crops for six years, 
EXO.23.11	but let the land be renewed and lie uncultivated during the seventh year. Then let the poor among you harvest whatever grows on its own. Leave the rest for wild animals to eat. The same applies to your vineyards and olive groves.
EXO.23.12	“You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but on the seventh day you must stop working. This gives your ox and your donkey a chance to rest. It also allows your slaves and the foreigners living among you to be refreshed.
EXO.23.13	“Pay close attention to all my instructions. You must not call on the name of any other gods. Do not even speak their names.
EXO.23.14	“Each year you must celebrate three festivals in my honor. 
EXO.23.15	First, celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast, just as I commanded you. Celebrate this festival annually at the appointed time in early spring, in the month of Abib,
EXO.23.16	“Second, celebrate the Festival of Harvest,
EXO.23.16	“Finally, celebrate the Festival of the Final Harvest
EXO.23.17	At these three times each year, every man in Israel must appear before the Sovereign, the 
EXO.23.18	“You must not offer the blood of my sacrificial offerings together with any baked goods containing yeast. And do not leave the fat from the festival offerings until the next morning.
EXO.23.19	“As you harvest your crops, bring the very best of the first harvest to the house of the 
EXO.23.19	“You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
EXO.23.20	“See, I am sending an angel before you to protect you on your journey and lead you safely to the place I have prepared for you. 
EXO.23.21	Pay close attention to him, and obey his instructions. Do not rebel against him, for he is my representative, and he will not forgive your rebellion. 
EXO.23.22	But if you are careful to obey him, following all my instructions, then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and I will oppose those who oppose you. 
EXO.23.23	For my angel will go before you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, so you may live there. And I will destroy them completely. 
EXO.23.24	You must not worship the gods of these nations or serve them in any way or imitate their evil practices. Instead, you must utterly destroy them and smash their sacred pillars.
EXO.23.25	“You must serve only the 
EXO.23.26	There will be no miscarriages or infertility in your land, and I will give you long, full lives.
EXO.23.27	“I will send my terror ahead of you and create panic among all the people whose lands you invade. I will make all your enemies turn and run. 
EXO.23.28	I will send terror
EXO.23.29	But I will not drive them out in a single year, because the land would become desolate and the wild animals would multiply and threaten you. 
EXO.23.30	I will drive them out a little at a time until your population has increased enough to take possession of the land. 
EXO.23.31	And I will fix your boundaries from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea,
EXO.23.32	“Make no treaties with them or their gods. 
EXO.23.33	They must not live in your land, or they will cause you to sin against me. If you serve their gods, you will be caught in the trap of idolatry.”
EXO.24.1	Then the 
EXO.24.2	Only Moses is allowed to come near to the 
EXO.24.3	Then Moses went down to the people and repeated all the instructions and regulations the 
EXO.24.4	Then Moses carefully wrote down all the 
EXO.24.5	Then he sent some of the young Israelite men to present burnt offerings and to sacrifice bulls as peace offerings to the 
EXO.24.6	Moses drained half the blood from these animals into basins. The other half he splattered against the altar.
EXO.24.7	Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it aloud to the people. Again they all responded, “We will do everything the 
EXO.24.8	Then Moses took the blood from the basins and splattered it over the people, declaring, “Look, this blood confirms the covenant the 
EXO.24.9	Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel climbed up the mountain. 
EXO.24.10	There they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there seemed to be a surface of brilliant blue lapis lazuli, as clear as the sky itself. 
EXO.24.11	And though these nobles of Israel gazed upon God, he did not destroy them. In fact, they ate a covenant meal, eating and drinking in his presence!
EXO.24.12	Then the 
EXO.24.13	So Moses and his assistant Joshua set out, and Moses climbed up the mountain of God.
EXO.24.14	Moses told the elders, “Stay here and wait for us until we come back. Aaron and Hur are here with you. If anyone has a dispute while I am gone, consult with them.”
EXO.24.15	Then Moses climbed up the mountain, and the cloud covered it. 
EXO.24.16	And the glory of the 
EXO.24.17	To the Israelites at the foot of the mountain, the glory of the

EXO.25.1	The 
EXO.25.2	“Tell the people of Israel to bring me their sacred offerings. Accept the contributions from all whose hearts are moved to offer them. 
EXO.25.3	Here is a list of sacred offerings you may accept from them:
EXO.25.3	gold, silver, and bronze;
EXO.25.4	blue, purple, and scarlet thread;
EXO.25.4	fine linen and goat hair for cloth;
EXO.25.5	tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather;
EXO.25.5	acacia wood;
EXO.25.6	olive oil for the lamps;
EXO.25.6	spices for the anointing oil and the fragrant incense;
EXO.25.7	onyx stones, and other gemstones to be set in the ephod and the priest’s chestpiece.
EXO.25.8	“Have the people of Israel build me a holy sanctuary so I can live among them. 
EXO.25.9	You must build this Tabernacle and its furnishings exactly according to the pattern I will show you.
EXO.25.10	“Have the people make an Ark of acacia wood—a sacred chest 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high.
EXO.25.11	Overlay it inside and outside with pure gold, and run a molding of gold all around it. 
EXO.25.12	Cast four gold rings and attach them to its four feet, two rings on each side. 
EXO.25.13	Make poles from acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 
EXO.25.14	Insert the poles into the rings at the sides of the Ark to carry it. 
EXO.25.15	These carrying poles must stay inside the rings; never remove them. 
EXO.25.16	When the Ark is finished, place inside it the stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant,
EXO.25.17	“Then make the Ark’s cover—the place of atonement—from pure gold. It must be 45 inches long and 27 inches wide.
EXO.25.18	Then make two cherubim from hammered gold, and place them on the two ends of the atonement cover. 
EXO.25.19	Mold the cherubim on each end of the atonement cover, making it all of one piece of gold. 
EXO.25.20	The cherubim will face each other and look down on the atonement cover. With their wings spread above it, they will protect it. 
EXO.25.21	Place inside the Ark the stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant, which I will give to you. Then put the atonement cover on top of the Ark. 
EXO.25.22	I will meet with you there and talk to you from above the atonement cover between the gold cherubim that hover over the Ark of the Covenant.
EXO.25.23	“Then make a table of acacia wood, 36 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 27 inches high.
EXO.25.24	Overlay it with pure gold and run a gold molding around the edge. 
EXO.25.25	Decorate it with a 3-inch border
EXO.25.26	Make four gold rings for the table and attach them at the four corners next to the four legs. 
EXO.25.27	Attach the rings near the border to hold the poles that are used to carry the table. 
EXO.25.28	Make these poles from acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 
EXO.25.29	Make special containers of pure gold for the table—bowls, ladles, pitchers, and jars—to be used in pouring out liquid offerings. 
EXO.25.30	Place the Bread of the Presence on the table to remain before me at all times.
EXO.25.31	“Make a lampstand of pure, hammered gold. Make the entire lampstand and its decorations of one piece—the base, center stem, lamp cups, buds, and petals. 
EXO.25.32	Make it with six branches going out from the center stem, three on each side. 
EXO.25.33	Each of the six branches will have three lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals. 
EXO.25.34	Craft the center stem of the lampstand with four lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals. 
EXO.25.35	There will also be an almond bud beneath each pair of branches where the six branches extend from the center stem. 
EXO.25.36	The almond buds and branches must all be of one piece with the center stem, and they must be hammered from pure gold. 
EXO.25.37	Then make the seven lamps for the lampstand, and set them so they reflect their light forward.

EXO.26.4	Put loops of blue yarn along the edge of the last curtain in each set. 
EXO.26.5	The fifty loops along the edge of one curtain are to match the fifty loops along the edge of the other curtain.

EXO.26.24	These corner frames will be matched at the bottom and firmly attached at the top with a single ring, forming a single corner unit. Make both of these corner units the same way. 
EXO.26.25	So there will be eight frames at the rear of the Tabernacle, set in sixteen silver bases—two bases under each frame.

EXO.27.6	For carrying the altar, make poles from acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze. 
EXO.27.7	Insert the poles through the rings on the two sides of the altar. 
EXO.27.8	The altar must be hollow, made from planks. Build it just as you were shown on the mountain.

EXO.28.2	Make sacred garments for Aaron that are glorious and beautiful. 
EXO.28.3	Instruct all the skilled craftsmen whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom. Have them make garments for Aaron that will distinguish him as a priest set apart for my service. 
EXO.28.4	These are the garments they are to make: a chestpiece, an ephod, a robe, a patterned tunic, a turban, and a sash. They are to make these sacred garments for your brother, Aaron, and his sons to wear when they serve me as priests. 
EXO.28.5	So give them fine linen cloth, gold thread, and blue, purple, and scarlet thread.
EXO.28.6	“The craftsmen must make the ephod of finely woven linen and skillfully embroider it with gold and with blue, purple, and scarlet thread.

EXO.28.10	Six names will be on each stone, arranged in the order of the births of the original sons of Israel. 
EXO.28.11	Engrave these names on the two stones in the same way a jeweler engraves a seal. Then mount the stones in settings of gold filigree. 
EXO.28.12	Fasten the two stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod as a reminder that Aaron represents the people of Israel. Aaron will carry these names on his shoulders as a constant reminder whenever he goes before the

EXO.28.21	Each stone will represent one of the twelve sons of Israel, and the name of that tribe will be engraved on it like a seal.
EXO.28.22	“To attach the chestpiece to the ephod, make braided cords of pure gold thread. 
EXO.28.23	Then make two gold rings and attach them to the top corners of the chestpiece. 
EXO.28.24	Tie the two gold cords to the two rings on the chestpiece. 
EXO.28.25	Tie the other ends of the cords to the gold settings on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod.

EXO.28.27	And make two more gold rings and attach them to the front of the ephod, below the shoulder-pieces, just above the knot where the decorative sash is fastened to the ephod. 
EXO.28.28	Then attach the bottom rings of the chestpiece to the rings on the ephod with blue cords. This will hold the chestpiece securely to the ephod above the decorative sash.
EXO.28.29	“In this way, Aaron will carry the names of the tribes of Israel on the sacred chestpiece

EXO.28.41	Clothe your brother, Aaron, and his sons with these garments, and then anoint and ordain them. Consecrate them so they can serve as my priests. 
EXO.28.42	Also make linen undergarments for them, to be worn next to their bodies, reaching from their hips to their thighs. 
EXO.28.43	These must be worn whenever Aaron and his sons enter the Tabernacle
EXO.29.1	“This is the ceremony you must follow when you consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests: Take a young bull and two rams with no defects. 
EXO.29.2	Then, using choice wheat flour and no yeast, make loaves of bread, thin cakes mixed with olive oil, and wafers spread with oil.

EXO.29.6	Place the turban on his head, and fasten the sacred medallion to the turban. 
EXO.29.7	Then anoint him by pouring the anointing oil over his head. 
EXO.29.8	Next present his sons, and dress them in their tunics. 
EXO.29.9	Wrap the sashes around the waists of Aaron and his sons, and put their special head coverings on them. Then the right to the priesthood will be theirs by law forever. In this way, you will ordain Aaron and his sons.
EXO.29.10	“Bring the young bull to the entrance of the Tabernacle, where Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on its head. 
EXO.29.11	Then slaughter the bull in the 
EXO.29.12	Put some of its blood on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour out the rest at the base of the altar. 
EXO.29.13	Take all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat around them, and burn it all on the altar. 
EXO.29.14	Then take the rest of the bull, including its hide, meat, and dung, and burn it outside the camp as a sin offering.
EXO.29.15	“Next Aaron and his sons must lay their hands on the head of one of the rams. 
EXO.29.16	Then slaughter the ram, and splatter its blood against all sides of the altar. 
EXO.29.17	Cut the ram into pieces, and wash off the internal organs and the legs. Set them alongside the head and the other pieces of the body, 
EXO.29.18	then burn the entire animal on the altar. This is a burnt offering to the 
EXO.29.19	“Now take the other ram, and have Aaron and his sons lay their hands on its head. 
EXO.29.20	Then slaughter it, and apply some of its blood to the right earlobes of Aaron and his sons. Also put it on the thumbs of their right hands and the big toes of their right feet. Splatter the rest of the blood against all sides of the altar. 
EXO.29.21	Then take some of the blood from the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his sons and on their garments. In this way, they and their garments will be set apart as holy.
EXO.29.22	“Since this is the ram for the ordination of Aaron and his sons, take the fat of the ram, including the fat of the broad tail, the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat around them, along with the right thigh. 
EXO.29.23	Then take one round loaf of bread, one thin cake mixed with olive oil, and one wafer from the basket of bread without yeast that was placed in the 
EXO.29.24	Put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons to be lifted up as a special offering to the 
EXO.29.25	Afterward take the various breads from their hands, and burn them on the altar along with the burnt offering. It is a pleasing aroma to the

EXO.29.27	“Set aside the portions of the ordination ram that belong to Aaron and his sons. This includes the breast and the thigh that were lifted up before the 
EXO.29.28	In the future, whenever the people of Israel lift up a peace offering, a portion of it must be set aside for Aaron and his descendants. This is their permanent right, and it is a sacred offering from the Israelites to the 
EXO.29.29	“Aaron’s sacred garments must be preserved for his descendants who succeed him, and they will wear them when they are anointed and ordained. 
EXO.29.30	The descendant who succeeds him as high priest will wear these clothes for seven days as he ministers in the Tabernacle and the Holy Place.
EXO.29.31	“Take the ram used in the ordination ceremony, and boil its meat in a sacred place. 
EXO.29.32	Then Aaron and his sons will eat this meat, along with the bread in the basket, at the Tabernacle entrance. 
EXO.29.33	They alone may eat the meat and bread used for their purification
EXO.29.34	If any of the ordination meat or bread remains until the morning, it must be burned. It may not be eaten, for it is holy.
EXO.29.35	“This is how you will ordain Aaron and his sons to their offices, just as I have commanded you. The ordination ceremony will go on for seven days. 
EXO.29.36	Each day you must sacrifice a young bull as a sin offering to purify them, making them right with the 
EXO.29.37	Purify the altar, and consecrate it every day for seven days. After that, the altar will be absolutely holy, and whatever touches it will become holy.
EXO.29.38	“These are the sacrifices you are to offer regularly on the altar. Each day, offer two lambs that are a year old, 
EXO.29.39	one in the morning and the other in the evening. 
EXO.29.40	With one of them, offer two quarts of choice flour mixed with one quart of pure oil of pressed olives; also, offer one quart of wine
EXO.29.41	Offer the other lamb in the evening, along with the same offerings of flour and wine as in the morning. It will be a pleasing aroma, a special gift presented to the 
EXO.29.42	“These burnt offerings are to be made each day from generation to generation. Offer them in the 
EXO.29.43	I will meet the people of Israel there, in the place made holy by my glorious presence. 
EXO.29.44	Yes, I will consecrate the Tabernacle and the altar, and I will consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests. 
EXO.29.45	Then I will live among the people of Israel and be their God, 
EXO.29.46	and they will know that I am the

EXO.30.2	Make it 18 inches square and 36 inches high,
EXO.30.3	Overlay the top, sides, and horns of the altar with pure gold, and run a gold molding around the entire altar. 
EXO.30.4	Make two gold rings, and attach them on opposite sides of the altar below the gold molding to hold the carrying poles. 
EXO.30.5	Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 
EXO.30.6	Place the incense altar just outside the inner curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant,
EXO.30.7	“Every morning when Aaron maintains the lamps, he must burn fragrant incense on the altar. 
EXO.30.8	And each evening when he lights the lamps, he must again burn incense in the 
EXO.30.9	Do not offer any unholy incense on this altar, or any burnt offerings, grain offerings, or liquid offerings.
EXO.30.10	“Once a year Aaron must purify
EXO.30.11	Then the 
EXO.30.12	“Whenever you take a census of the people of Israel, each man who is counted must pay a ransom for himself to the 
EXO.30.13	Each person who is counted must give a small piece of silver as a sacred offering to the 
EXO.30.14	All who have reached their twentieth birthday must give this sacred offering to the 
EXO.30.15	When this offering is given to the 
EXO.30.16	Receive this ransom money from the Israelites, and use it for the care of the Tabernacle.
EXO.30.17	Then the 
EXO.30.18	“Make a bronze washbasin with a bronze stand. Place it between the Tabernacle and the altar, and fill it with water. 
EXO.30.19	Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and feet there. 
EXO.30.20	They must wash with water whenever they go into the Tabernacle to appear before the 
EXO.30.21	They must always wash their hands and feet, or they will die. This is a permanent law for Aaron and his descendants, to be observed from generation to generation.”
EXO.30.22	Then the 
EXO.30.23	“Collect choice spices—12
EXO.30.24	and 12
EXO.30.25	Like a skilled incense maker, blend these ingredients to make a holy anointing oil. 
EXO.30.26	Use this sacred oil to anoint the Tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant, 
EXO.30.27	the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and all its accessories, the incense altar, 
EXO.30.28	the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the washbasin with its stand. 
EXO.30.29	Consecrate them to make them absolutely holy. After this, whatever touches them will also become holy.
EXO.30.30	“Anoint Aaron and his sons also, consecrating them to serve me as priests. 
EXO.30.31	And say to the people of Israel, ‘This holy anointing oil is reserved for me from generation to generation. 
EXO.30.32	It must never be used to anoint anyone else, and you must never make any blend like it for yourselves. It is holy, and you must treat it as holy. 
EXO.30.33	Anyone who makes a blend like it or anoints someone other than a priest will be cut off from the community.’”
EXO.30.34	Then the 
EXO.30.35	Using the usual techniques of the incense maker, blend the spices together and sprinkle them with salt to produce a pure and holy incense. 
EXO.30.36	Grind some of the mixture into a very fine powder and put it in front of the Ark of the Covenant,
EXO.30.37	Never use this formula to make this incense for yourselves. It is reserved for the 
EXO.30.38	Anyone who makes incense like this for personal use will be cut off from the community.”
EXO.31.1	Then the 
EXO.31.2	“Look, I have specifically chosen Bezalel son of Uri, grandson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 
EXO.31.3	I have filled him with the Spirit of God, giving him great wisdom, ability, and expertise in all kinds of crafts. 
EXO.31.4	He is a master craftsman, expert in working with gold, silver, and bronze. 
EXO.31.5	He is skilled in engraving and mounting gemstones and in carving wood. He is a master at every craft!
EXO.31.6	“And I have personally appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to be his assistant. Moreover, I have given special skill to all the gifted craftsmen so they can make all the things I have commanded you to make:
EXO.31.7	the Tabernacle;
EXO.31.7	the Ark of the Covenant;
EXO.31.7	the Ark’s cover—the place of atonement;
EXO.31.7	all the furnishings of the Tabernacle;
EXO.31.8	the table and its utensils;
EXO.31.8	the pure gold lampstand with all its accessories;
EXO.31.8	the incense altar;
EXO.31.9	the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils;
EXO.31.9	the washbasin with its stand;
EXO.31.10	the beautifully stitched garments—the sacred garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to wear as they minister as priests;
EXO.31.11	the anointing oil;
EXO.31.11	the fragrant incense for the Holy Place.
EXO.31.11	The craftsmen must make everything as I have commanded you.”
EXO.31.12	The 
EXO.31.13	“Tell the people of Israel: ‘Be careful to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you from generation to generation. It is given so you may know that I am the 
EXO.31.14	You must keep the Sabbath day, for it is a holy day for you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community. 
EXO.31.15	You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day must be a Sabbath day of complete rest, a holy day dedicated to the 
EXO.31.16	The people of Israel must keep the Sabbath day by observing it from generation to generation. This is a covenant obligation for all time. 
EXO.31.17	It is a permanent sign of my covenant with the people of Israel. For in six days the 
EXO.31.18	When the 
EXO.32.1	When the people saw how long it was taking Moses to come back down the mountain, they gathered around Aaron. “Come on,” they said, “make us some gods who can lead us. We don’t know what happened to this fellow Moses, who brought us here from the land of Egypt.”
EXO.32.2	So Aaron said, “Take the gold rings from the ears of your wives and sons and daughters, and bring them to me.”
EXO.32.3	All the people took the gold rings from their ears and brought them to Aaron. 
EXO.32.4	Then Aaron took the gold, melted it down, and molded it into the shape of a calf. When the people saw it, they exclaimed, “O Israel, these are the gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt!”
EXO.32.5	Aaron saw how excited the people were, so he built an altar in front of the calf. Then he announced, “Tomorrow will be a festival to the 
EXO.32.6	The people got up early the next morning to sacrifice burnt offerings and peace offerings. After this, they celebrated with feasting and drinking, and they indulged in pagan revelry.
EXO.32.7	The 
EXO.32.8	How quickly they have turned away from the way I commanded them to live! They have melted down gold and made a calf, and they have bowed down and sacrificed to it. They are saying, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”
EXO.32.9	Then the 
EXO.32.10	Now leave me alone so my fierce anger can blaze against them, and I will destroy them. Then I will make you, Moses, into a great nation.”
EXO.32.11	But Moses tried to pacify the 
EXO.32.12	Why let the Egyptians say, ‘Their God rescued them with the evil intention of slaughtering them in the mountains and wiping them from the face of the earth’? Turn away from your fierce anger. Change your mind about this terrible disaster you have threatened against your people! 
EXO.32.13	Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
EXO.32.14	So the 
EXO.32.15	Then Moses turned and went down the mountain. He held in his hands the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant.
EXO.32.16	These tablets were God’s work; the words on them were written by God himself.
EXO.32.17	When Joshua heard the boisterous noise of the people shouting below them, he exclaimed to Moses, “It sounds like war in the camp!”
EXO.32.18	But Moses replied, “No, it’s not a shout of victory nor the wailing of defeat. I hear the sound of a celebration.”
EXO.32.19	When they came near the camp, Moses saw the calf and the dancing, and he burned with anger. He threw the stone tablets to the ground, smashing them at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.32.20	He took the calf they had made and burned it. Then he ground it into powder, threw it into the water, and forced the people to drink it.
EXO.32.21	Finally, he turned to Aaron and demanded, “What did these people do to you to make you bring such terrible sin upon them?”
EXO.32.22	“Don’t get so upset, my lord,” Aaron replied. “You yourself know how evil these people are. 
EXO.32.23	They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will lead us. We don’t know what happened to this fellow Moses, who brought us here from the land of Egypt.’ 
EXO.32.24	So I told them, ‘Whoever has gold jewelry, take it off.’ When they brought it to me, I simply threw it into the fire—and out came this calf!”
EXO.32.25	Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get completely out of control, much to the amusement of their enemies.
EXO.32.26	So he stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, “All of you who are on the 
EXO.32.27	Moses told them, “This is what the 
EXO.32.28	The Levites obeyed Moses’ command, and about 3,000 people died that day.
EXO.32.29	Then Moses told the Levites, “Today you have ordained yourselves
EXO.32.30	The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a terrible sin, but I will go back up to the 
EXO.32.31	So Moses returned to the 
EXO.32.32	But now, if you will only forgive their sin—but if not, erase my name from the record you have written!”
EXO.32.33	But the 
EXO.32.34	Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about. Look! My angel will lead the way before you. And when I come to call the people to account, I will certainly hold them responsible for their sins.”
EXO.32.35	Then the 
EXO.33.1	The 
EXO.33.2	And I will send an angel before you to drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
EXO.33.3	Go up to this land that flows with milk and honey. But I will not travel among you, for you are a stubborn and rebellious people. If I did, I would surely destroy you along the way.”
EXO.33.4	When the people heard these stern words, they went into mourning and stopped wearing their jewelry and fine clothes. 
EXO.33.5	For the 
EXO.33.6	So from the time they left Mount Sinai,
EXO.33.7	It was Moses’ practice to take the Tent of Meeting
EXO.33.8	Whenever Moses went out to the Tent of Meeting, all the people would get up and stand in the entrances of their own tents. They would all watch Moses until he disappeared inside. 
EXO.33.9	As he went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and hover at its entrance while the 
EXO.33.10	When the people saw the cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, they would stand and bow down in front of their own tents. 
EXO.33.11	Inside the Tent of Meeting, the 
EXO.33.12	One day Moses said to the 
EXO.33.13	If it is true that you look favorably on me, let me know your ways so I may understand you more fully and continue to enjoy your favor. And remember that this nation is your very own people.”
EXO.33.14	The 
EXO.33.15	Then Moses said, “If you don’t personally go with us, don’t make us leave this place. 
EXO.33.16	How will anyone know that you look favorably on me—on me and on your people—if you don’t go with us? For your presence among us sets your people and me apart from all other people on the earth.”
EXO.33.17	The 
EXO.33.18	Moses responded, “Then show me your glorious presence.”
EXO.33.19	The 
EXO.33.20	But you may not look directly at my face, for no one may see me and live.” 
EXO.33.21	The 
EXO.33.22	As my glorious presence passes by, I will hide you in the crevice of the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. 
EXO.33.23	Then I will remove my hand and let you see me from behind. But my face will not be seen.”
EXO.34.1	Then the 
EXO.34.2	Be ready in the morning to climb up Mount Sinai and present yourself to me on the top of the mountain. 
EXO.34.3	No one else may come with you. In fact, no one is to appear anywhere on the mountain. Do not even let the flocks or herds graze near the mountain.”
EXO.34.4	So Moses chiseled out two tablets of stone like the first ones. Early in the morning he climbed Mount Sinai as the 
EXO.34.5	Then the 
EXO.34.6	The 
EXO.34.6	“Yahweh!
EXO.34.6	The God of compassion and mercy!
EXO.34.6	I am slow to anger
EXO.34.6	and filled with unfailing love and faithfulness.
EXO.34.7	I lavish unfailing love to a thousand generations.
EXO.34.7	I forgive iniquity, rebellion, and sin.
EXO.34.7	But I do not excuse the guilty.
EXO.34.7	I lay the sins of the parents upon their children and grandchildren;
EXO.34.7	the entire family is affected—
EXO.34.7	even children in the third and fourth generations.”
EXO.34.8	Moses immediately threw himself to the ground and worshiped. 
EXO.34.9	And he said, “O Lord, if it is true that I have found favor with you, then please travel with us. Yes, this is a stubborn and rebellious people, but please forgive our iniquity and our sins. Claim us as your own special possession.”
EXO.34.10	The 
EXO.34.11	But listen carefully to everything I command you today. Then I will go ahead of you and drive out the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
EXO.34.12	“Be very careful never to make a treaty with the people who live in the land where you are going. If you do, you will follow their evil ways and be trapped. 
EXO.34.13	Instead, you must break down their pagan altars, smash their sacred pillars, and cut down their Asherah poles. 
EXO.34.14	You must worship no other gods, for the 
EXO.34.15	“You must not make a treaty of any kind with the people living in the land. They lust after their gods, offering sacrifices to them. They will invite you to join them in their sacrificial meals, and you will go with them. 
EXO.34.16	Then you will accept their daughters, who sacrifice to other gods, as wives for your sons. And they will seduce your sons to commit adultery against me by worshiping other gods. 
EXO.34.17	You must not make any gods of molten metal for yourselves.
EXO.34.18	“You must celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast, just as I commanded you. Celebrate this festival annually at the appointed time in early spring, in the month of Abib,
EXO.34.19	“The firstborn of every animal belongs to me, including the firstborn males
EXO.34.20	A firstborn donkey may be bought back from the 
EXO.34.20	“No one may appear before me without an offering.
EXO.34.21	“You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but on the seventh day you must stop working, even during the seasons of plowing and harvest.
EXO.34.22	“You must celebrate the Festival of Harvest
EXO.34.23	Three times each year every man in Israel must appear before the Sovereign, the 
EXO.34.24	I will drive out the other nations ahead of you and expand your territory, so no one will covet and conquer your land while you appear before the 
EXO.34.25	“You must not offer the blood of my sacrificial offerings together with any baked goods containing yeast. And none of the meat of the Passover sacrifice may be kept over until the next morning.
EXO.34.26	“As you harvest your crops, bring the very best of the first harvest to the house of the 
EXO.34.26	“You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
EXO.34.27	Then the 
EXO.34.28	Moses remained there on the mountain with the 
EXO.34.29	When Moses came down Mount Sinai carrying the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant,
EXO.34.30	So when Aaron and the people of Israel saw the radiance of Moses’ face, they were afraid to come near him.
EXO.34.31	But Moses called out to them and asked Aaron and all the leaders of the community to come over, and he talked with them. 
EXO.34.32	Then all the people of Israel approached him, and Moses gave them all the instructions the 
EXO.34.33	When Moses finished speaking with them, he covered his face with a veil. 
EXO.34.34	But whenever he went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with the 
EXO.34.35	and the people of Israel would see the radiant glow of his face. So he would put the veil over his face until he returned to speak with the 
EXO.35.1	Then Moses called together the whole community of Israel and told them, “These are the instructions the 
EXO.35.2	You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day must be a Sabbath day of complete rest, a holy day dedicated to the 
EXO.35.3	You must not even light a fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath.”
EXO.35.4	Then Moses said to the whole community of Israel, “This is what the 
EXO.35.5	Take a sacred offering for the 
EXO.35.5	gold, silver, and bronze;
EXO.35.6	blue, purple, and scarlet thread;
EXO.35.6	fine linen and goat hair for cloth;
EXO.35.7	tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather;
EXO.35.7	acacia wood;
EXO.35.8	olive oil for the lamps;
EXO.35.8	spices for the anointing oil and the fragrant incense;
EXO.35.9	onyx stones, and other gemstones to be set in the ephod and the priest’s chestpiece.
EXO.35.10	“Come, all of you who are gifted craftsmen. Construct everything that the 
EXO.35.11	the Tabernacle and its sacred tent, its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;
EXO.35.12	the Ark and its carrying poles;
EXO.35.12	the Ark’s cover—the place of atonement;
EXO.35.12	the inner curtain to shield the Ark;
EXO.35.13	the table, its carrying poles, and all its utensils;
EXO.35.13	the Bread of the Presence;
EXO.35.14	for light, the lampstand, its accessories, the lamp cups, and the olive oil for lighting;
EXO.35.15	the incense altar and its carrying poles;
EXO.35.15	the anointing oil and fragrant incense;
EXO.35.15	the curtain for the entrance of the Tabernacle;
EXO.35.16	the altar of burnt offering;
EXO.35.16	the bronze grating of the altar and its carrying poles and utensils;
EXO.35.16	the washbasin with its stand;
EXO.35.17	the curtains for the walls of the courtyard;
EXO.35.17	the posts and their bases;
EXO.35.17	the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;
EXO.35.18	the tent pegs of the Tabernacle and courtyard and their ropes;
EXO.35.19	the beautifully stitched garments for the priests to wear while ministering in the Holy Place—the sacred garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to wear as they minister as priests.”
EXO.35.20	So the whole community of Israel left Moses and returned to their tents. 
EXO.35.21	All whose hearts were stirred and whose spirits were moved came and brought their sacred offerings to the 
EXO.35.22	Both men and women came, all whose hearts were willing. They brought to the 
EXO.35.23	All those who owned the following items willingly brought them: blue, purple, and scarlet thread; fine linen and goat hair for cloth; and tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather. 
EXO.35.24	And all who had silver and bronze objects gave them as a sacred offering to the 
EXO.35.25	All the women who were skilled in sewing and spinning prepared blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine linen cloth. 
EXO.35.26	All the women who were willing used their skills to spin the goat hair into yarn. 
EXO.35.27	The leaders brought onyx stones and the special gemstones to be set in the ephod and the priest’s chestpiece. 
EXO.35.28	They also brought spices and olive oil for the light, the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense. 
EXO.35.29	So the people of Israel—every man and woman who was eager to help in the work the 
EXO.35.30	Then Moses told the people of Israel, “The 
EXO.35.31	The 
EXO.35.32	He is a master craftsman, expert in working with gold, silver, and bronze. 
EXO.35.33	He is skilled in engraving and mounting gemstones and in carving wood. He is a master at every craft. 
EXO.35.34	And the 
EXO.35.35	The 
EXO.36.1	“The 
EXO.36.2	So Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and all the others who were specially gifted by the 
EXO.36.3	Moses gave them the materials donated by the people of Israel as sacred offerings for the completion of the sanctuary. But the people continued to bring additional gifts each morning. 
EXO.36.4	Finally the craftsmen who were working on the sanctuary left their work. 
EXO.36.5	They went to Moses and reported, “The people have given more than enough materials to complete the job the 
EXO.36.6	So Moses gave the command, and this message was sent throughout the camp: “Men and women, don’t prepare any more gifts for the sanctuary. We have enough!” So the people stopped bringing their sacred offerings. 
EXO.36.7	Their contributions were more than enough to complete the whole project.
EXO.36.8	The skilled craftsmen made ten curtains of finely woven linen for the Tabernacle. Then Bezalel
EXO.36.9	All ten curtains were exactly the same size—42 feet long and 6 feet wide.
EXO.36.10	Five of these curtains were joined together to make one long curtain, and the other five were joined to make a second long curtain. 
EXO.36.11	He made fifty loops of blue yarn and put them along the edge of the last curtain in each set. 
EXO.36.12	The fifty loops along the edge of one curtain matched the fifty loops along the edge of the other curtain. 
EXO.36.13	Then he made fifty gold clasps and fastened the long curtains together with the clasps. In this way, the Tabernacle was made of one continuous piece.
EXO.36.14	He made eleven curtains of goat-hair cloth to serve as a tent covering for the Tabernacle. 
EXO.36.15	These eleven curtains were all exactly the same size—45 feet long and 6 feet wide.
EXO.36.16	Bezalel joined five of these curtains together to make one long curtain, and the other six were joined to make a second long curtain. 
EXO.36.17	He made fifty loops for the edge of each large curtain. 
EXO.36.18	He also made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the long curtains together. In this way, the tent covering was made of one continuous piece. 
EXO.36.19	He completed the tent covering with a layer of tanned ram skins and a layer of fine goatskin leather.
EXO.36.20	For the framework of the Tabernacle, Bezalel constructed frames of acacia wood. 
EXO.36.21	Each frame was 15 feet high and 27 inches wide,
EXO.36.22	with two pegs under each frame. All the frames were identical. 
EXO.36.23	He made twenty of these frames to support the curtains on the south side of the Tabernacle. 
EXO.36.24	He also made forty silver bases—two bases under each frame, with the pegs fitting securely into the bases. 
EXO.36.25	For the north side of the Tabernacle, he made another twenty frames, 
EXO.36.26	with their forty silver bases, two bases under each frame. 
EXO.36.27	He made six frames for the rear—the west side of the Tabernacle—
EXO.36.28	along with two additional frames to reinforce the rear corners of the Tabernacle. 
EXO.36.29	These corner frames were matched at the bottom and firmly attached at the top with a single ring, forming a single corner unit. Both of these corner units were made the same way. 
EXO.36.30	So there were eight frames at the rear of the Tabernacle, set in sixteen silver bases—two bases under each frame.
EXO.36.31	Then he made crossbars of acacia wood to link the frames, five crossbars for the north side of the Tabernacle 
EXO.36.32	and five for the south side. He also made five crossbars for the rear of the Tabernacle, which faced west. 
EXO.36.33	He made the middle crossbar to attach halfway up the frames; it ran all the way from one end of the Tabernacle to the other. 
EXO.36.34	He overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. Then he overlaid the crossbars with gold as well.
EXO.36.35	For the inside of the Tabernacle, Bezalel made a special curtain of finely woven linen. He decorated it with blue, purple, and scarlet thread and with skillfully embroidered cherubim. 
EXO.36.36	For the curtain, he made four posts of acacia wood and four gold hooks. He overlaid the posts with gold and set them in four silver bases.
EXO.36.37	Then he made another curtain for the entrance to the sacred tent. He made it of finely woven linen and embroidered it with exquisite designs using blue, purple, and scarlet thread. 
EXO.36.38	This curtain was hung on gold hooks attached to five posts. The posts with their decorated tops and hooks were overlaid with gold, and the five bases were cast from bronze.
EXO.37.1	Next Bezalel made the Ark of acacia wood—a sacred chest 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high.
EXO.37.2	He overlaid it inside and outside with pure gold, and he ran a molding of gold all around it. 
EXO.37.3	He cast four gold rings and attached them to its four feet, two rings on each side. 
EXO.37.4	Then he made poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.5	He inserted the poles into the rings at the sides of the Ark to carry it.
EXO.37.6	Then he made the Ark’s cover—the place of atonement—from pure gold. It was 45 inches long and 27 inches wide.
EXO.37.7	He made two cherubim from hammered gold and placed them on the two ends of the atonement cover. 
EXO.37.8	He molded the cherubim on each end of the atonement cover, making it all of one piece of gold. 
EXO.37.9	The cherubim faced each other and looked down on the atonement cover. With their wings spread above it, they protected it.
EXO.37.10	Then Bezalel
EXO.37.11	He overlaid it with pure gold and ran a gold molding around the edge. 
EXO.37.12	He decorated it with a 3-inch border
EXO.37.13	Then he cast four gold rings for the table and attached them at the four corners next to the four legs. 
EXO.37.14	The rings were attached near the border to hold the poles that were used to carry the table. 
EXO.37.15	He made these poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.16	Then he made special containers of pure gold for the table—bowls, ladles, jars, and pitchers—to be used in pouring out liquid offerings.
EXO.37.17	Then Bezalel made the lampstand of pure, hammered gold. He made the entire lampstand and its decorations of one piece—the base, center stem, lamp cups, buds, and petals. 
EXO.37.18	The lampstand had six branches going out from the center stem, three on each side. 
EXO.37.19	Each of the six branches had three lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals. 
EXO.37.20	The center stem of the lampstand was crafted with four lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals. 
EXO.37.21	There was an almond bud beneath each pair of branches where the six branches extended from the center stem, all made of one piece. 
EXO.37.22	The almond buds and branches were all of one piece with the center stem, and they were hammered from pure gold.
EXO.37.23	He also made seven lamps for the lampstand, lamp snuffers, and trays, all of pure gold. 
EXO.37.24	The entire lampstand, along with its accessories, was made from 75 pounds
EXO.37.25	Then Bezalel made the incense altar of acacia wood. It was 18 inches square and 36 inches high,
EXO.37.26	He overlaid the top, sides, and horns of the altar with pure gold, and he ran a gold molding around the entire altar. 
EXO.37.27	He made two gold rings and attached them on opposite sides of the altar below the gold molding to hold the carrying poles. 
EXO.37.28	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
EXO.37.29	Then he made the sacred anointing oil and the fragrant incense, using the techniques of a skilled incense maker.
EXO.38.1	Next Bezalel
EXO.38.2	He made horns for each of its four corners so that the horns and altar were all one piece. He overlaid the altar with bronze. 
EXO.38.3	Then he made all the altar utensils of bronze—the ash buckets, shovels, basins, meat forks, and firepans. 
EXO.38.4	Next he made a bronze grating and installed it halfway down the side of the altar, under the ledge. 
EXO.38.5	He cast four rings and attached them to the corners of the bronze grating to hold the carrying poles. 
EXO.38.6	He made the poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 
EXO.38.7	He inserted the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar. The altar was hollow and was made from planks.
EXO.38.8	Bezalel made the bronze washbasin and its bronze stand from bronze mirrors donated by the women who served at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
EXO.38.9	Then Bezalel made the courtyard, which was enclosed with curtains made of finely woven linen. On the south side the curtains were 150 feet long.
EXO.38.10	They were held up by twenty posts set securely in twenty bronze bases. He hung the curtains with silver hooks and rings. 
EXO.38.11	He made a similar set of curtains for the north side—150 feet of curtains held up by twenty posts set securely in bronze bases. He hung the curtains with silver hooks and rings. 
EXO.38.12	The curtains on the west end of the courtyard were 75 feet long,
EXO.38.13	The east end, the front, was also 75 feet long.
EXO.38.14	The courtyard entrance was on the east end, flanked by two curtains. The curtain on the right side was 22
EXO.38.15	The curtain on the left side was also 22
EXO.38.16	All the curtains used in the courtyard were made of finely woven linen. 
EXO.38.17	Each post had a bronze base, and all the hooks and rings were silver. The tops of the posts of the courtyard were overlaid with silver, and the rings to hold up the curtains were made of silver.
EXO.38.18	He made the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard of finely woven linen, and he decorated it with beautiful embroidery in blue, purple, and scarlet thread. It was 30 feet long, and its height was 7
EXO.38.19	It was supported by four posts, each set securely in its own bronze base. The tops of the posts were overlaid with silver, and the hooks and rings were also made of silver.
EXO.38.20	All the tent pegs used in the Tabernacle and courtyard were made of bronze.
EXO.38.21	This is an inventory of the materials used in building the Tabernacle of the Covenant.
EXO.38.22	Bezalel son of Uri, grandson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything just as the 
EXO.38.23	He was assisted by Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman expert at engraving, designing, and embroidering with blue, purple, and scarlet thread on fine linen cloth.
EXO.38.24	The people brought special offerings of gold totaling 2,193 pounds,
EXO.38.25	The whole community of Israel gave 7,545 pounds
EXO.38.26	This silver came from the tax collected from each man registered in the census. (The tax is one beka, which is half a shekel,
EXO.38.27	The hundred bases for the frames of the sanctuary walls and for the posts supporting the inner curtain required 7,500 pounds of silver, about 75 pounds for each base.
EXO.38.28	The remaining 45 pounds
EXO.38.29	The people also brought as special offerings 5,310 pounds
EXO.38.30	which was used for casting the bases for the posts at the entrance to the Tabernacle, and for the bronze altar with its bronze grating and all the altar utensils. 
EXO.38.31	Bronze was also used to make the bases for the posts that supported the curtains around the courtyard, the bases for the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard, and all the tent pegs for the Tabernacle and the courtyard.
EXO.39.1	The craftsmen made beautiful sacred garments of blue, purple, and scarlet cloth—clothing for Aaron to wear while ministering in the Holy Place, just as the 
EXO.39.2	Bezalel
EXO.39.3	He made gold thread by hammering out thin sheets of gold and cutting it into fine strands. With great skill and care, he worked it into the fine linen with the blue, purple, and scarlet thread.
EXO.39.4	The ephod consisted of two pieces, front and back, joined at the shoulders with two shoulder-pieces. 
EXO.39.5	The decorative sash was made of the same materials: finely woven linen embroidered with gold and with blue, purple, and scarlet thread, just as the 
EXO.39.6	They mounted the two onyx stones in settings of gold filigree. The stones were engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel, just as a seal is engraved. 
EXO.39.7	He fastened these stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod as a reminder that the priest represents the people of Israel. All this was done just as the 
EXO.39.8	Bezalel made the chestpiece with great skill and care. He made it to match the ephod, using finely woven linen embroidered with gold and with blue, purple, and scarlet thread. 
EXO.39.9	He made the chestpiece of a single piece of cloth folded to form a pouch nine inches
EXO.39.10	They mounted four rows of gemstones
EXO.39.11	The second row contained a turquoise, a blue lapis lazuli, and a white moonstone. 
EXO.39.12	The third row contained an orange jacinth, an agate, and a purple amethyst. 
EXO.39.13	The fourth row contained a blue-green beryl, an onyx, and a green jasper. All these stones were set in gold filigree. 
EXO.39.14	Each stone represented one of the twelve sons of Israel, and the name of that tribe was engraved on it like a seal.
EXO.39.15	To attach the chestpiece to the ephod, they made braided cords of pure gold thread. 
EXO.39.16	They also made two settings of gold filigree and two gold rings and attached them to the top corners of the chestpiece. 
EXO.39.17	They tied the two gold cords to the rings on the chestpiece. 
EXO.39.18	They tied the other ends of the cords to the gold settings on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod. 
EXO.39.19	Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the inside edges of the chestpiece next to the ephod. 
EXO.39.20	Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the front of the ephod, below the shoulder-pieces, just above the knot where the decorative sash was fastened to the ephod. 
EXO.39.21	They attached the bottom rings of the chestpiece to the rings on the ephod with blue cords. In this way, the chestpiece was held securely to the ephod above the decorative sash. All this was done just as the 
EXO.39.22	Bezalel made the robe that is worn with the ephod from a single piece of blue woven cloth, 
EXO.39.23	with an opening for Aaron’s head in the middle of it. The opening was reinforced with a woven collar
EXO.39.24	They made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and attached them to the hem of the robe. 
EXO.39.25	They also made bells of pure gold and placed them between the pomegranates along the hem of the robe, 
EXO.39.26	with bells and pomegranates alternating all around the hem. This robe was to be worn whenever the priest ministered before the 
EXO.39.27	They made tunics for Aaron and his sons from fine linen cloth. 
EXO.39.28	The turban and the special head coverings were made of fine linen, and the undergarments were also made of finely woven linen. 
EXO.39.29	The sashes were made of finely woven linen and embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet thread, just as the 
EXO.39.30	Finally, they made the sacred medallion—the badge of holiness—of pure gold. They engraved it like a seal with these words: 
EXO.39.31	They attached the medallion with a blue cord to Aaron’s turban, just as the 
EXO.39.32	And so at last the Tabernacle
EXO.39.33	And they brought the entire Tabernacle to Moses:
EXO.39.33	the sacred tent with all its furnishings, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;
EXO.39.34	the tent coverings of tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather;
EXO.39.34	the inner curtain to shield the Ark;
EXO.39.35	the Ark of the Covenant
EXO.39.35	the Ark’s cover—the place of atonement;
EXO.39.36	the table and all its utensils;
EXO.39.36	the Bread of the Presence;
EXO.39.37	the pure gold lampstand with its symmetrical lamp cups, all its accessories, and the olive oil for lighting;
EXO.39.38	the gold altar;
EXO.39.38	the anointing oil and fragrant incense;
EXO.39.38	the curtain for the entrance of the sacred tent;
EXO.39.39	the bronze altar;
EXO.39.39	the bronze grating and its carrying poles and utensils;
EXO.39.39	the washbasin with its stand;
EXO.39.40	the curtains for the walls of the courtyard;
EXO.39.40	the posts and their bases;
EXO.39.40	the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;
EXO.39.40	the ropes and tent pegs;
EXO.39.40	all the furnishings to be used in worship at the Tabernacle;
EXO.39.41	the beautifully stitched garments for the priests to wear while ministering in the Holy Place—the sacred garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to wear as they minister as priests.
EXO.39.42	So the people of Israel followed all of the 
EXO.39.43	Then Moses inspected all their work. When he found it had been done just as the 
EXO.40.1	Then the 
EXO.40.2	“Set up the Tabernacle
EXO.40.3	Place the Ark of the Covenant
EXO.40.4	Then bring in the table, and arrange the utensils on it. And bring in the lampstand, and set up the lamps.
EXO.40.5	“Place the gold incense altar in front of the Ark of the Covenant. Then hang the curtain at the entrance of the Tabernacle. 
EXO.40.6	Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the Tabernacle entrance. 
EXO.40.7	Set the washbasin between the Tabernacle
EXO.40.8	Then set up the courtyard around the outside of the tent, and hang the curtain for the courtyard entrance.
EXO.40.9	“Take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle and all its furnishings to consecrate them and make them holy.

EXO.40.29	and he placed the altar of burnt offering near the Tabernacle entrance. On it he offered a burnt offering and a grain offering, just as the 
EXO.40.30	Next Moses placed the washbasin between the Tabernacle and the altar. He filled it with water so the priests could wash themselves. 
EXO.40.31	Moses and Aaron and Aaron’s sons used water from it to wash their hands and feet. 
EXO.40.32	Whenever they approached the altar and entered the Tabernacle, they washed themselves, just as the

LEV.9.3	Then tell the Israelites, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and take a calf and a lamb, both a year old and without defects, for a burnt offering. 
LEV.9.4	Also take a bull
LEV.9.5	So the people presented all these things at the entrance of the Tabernacle,
LEV.9.6	And Moses said, “This is what the 
LEV.9.7	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering to purify yourself and the people. Then present the offerings of the people to purify them, making them right with the 
LEV.9.8	So Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself. 
LEV.9.9	His sons brought him the blood, and he dipped his finger in it and put it on the horns of the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 
LEV.9.10	Then he burned on the altar the fat, the kidneys, and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, just as the 
LEV.9.11	The meat and the hide, however, he burned outside the camp.
LEV.9.12	Next Aaron slaughtered the animal for the burnt offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it against all sides of the altar. 
LEV.9.13	Then they handed him each piece of the burnt offering, including the head, and he burned them on the altar. 
LEV.9.14	Then he washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on the altar along with the rest of the burnt offering.
LEV.9.15	Next Aaron presented the offerings of the people. He slaughtered the people’s goat and presented it as an offering for their sin, just as he had first done with the offering for his own sin. 
LEV.9.16	Then he presented the burnt offering and sacrificed it in the prescribed way. 
LEV.9.17	He also presented the grain offering, burning a handful of the flour mixture on the altar, in addition to the regular burnt offering for the morning.
LEV.9.18	Then Aaron slaughtered the bull and the ram for the people’s peace offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it against all sides of the altar. 
LEV.9.19	Then he took the fat of the bull and the ram—the fat of the broad tail and from around the internal organs—along with the kidneys and the long lobes of the livers. 
LEV.9.20	He placed these fat portions on top of the breasts of these animals and burned them on the altar. 
LEV.9.21	Aaron then lifted up the breasts and right thighs as a special offering to the 
LEV.9.22	After that, Aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them. Then, after presenting the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering, he stepped down from the altar. 
LEV.9.23	Then Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle, and when they came back out, they blessed the people again, and the glory of the 
LEV.9.24	Fire blazed forth from the 
LEV.10.1	Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu put coals of fire in their incense burners and sprinkled incense over them. In this way, they disobeyed the 
LEV.10.2	So fire blazed forth from the 
LEV.10.3	Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the 
LEV.10.3	‘I will display my holiness
LEV.10.3	through those who come near me.
LEV.10.3	I will display my glory
LEV.10.3	before all the people.’”
LEV.10.3	And Aaron was silent.
LEV.10.4	Then Moses called for Mishael and Elzaphan, Aaron’s cousins, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel. He said to them, “Come forward and carry away the bodies of your relatives from in front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp.” 
LEV.10.5	So they came forward and picked them up by their garments and carried them out of the camp, just as Moses had commanded.
LEV.10.6	Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not show grief by leaving your hair uncombed
LEV.10.7	But you must not leave the entrance of the Tabernacle
LEV.10.8	Then the 
LEV.10.9	“You and your descendants must never drink wine or any other alcoholic drink before going into the Tabernacle. If you do, you will die. This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation. 
LEV.10.10	You must distinguish between what is sacred and what is common, between what is ceremonially unclean and what is clean. 
LEV.10.11	And you must teach the Israelites all the decrees that the 
LEV.10.12	Then Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take what is left of the grain offering after a portion has been presented as a special gift to the 
LEV.10.13	You must eat it in a sacred place, for it has been given to you and your descendants as your portion of the special gifts presented to the 
LEV.10.14	But the breast and thigh that were lifted up as a special offering may be eaten in any place that is ceremonially clean. These parts have been given to you and your descendants as your portion of the peace offerings presented by the people of Israel. 
LEV.10.15	You must lift up the thigh and breast as a special offering to the 
LEV.10.16	Moses then asked them what had happened to the goat of the sin offering. When he discovered it had been burned up, he became very angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons. 
LEV.10.17	“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the sacred area?” he demanded. “It is a holy offering! The 
LEV.10.18	Since the animal’s blood was not brought into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the meat in the sacred area as I ordered you.”
LEV.10.19	Then Aaron answered Moses, “Today my sons presented both their sin offering and their burnt offering to the 
LEV.10.20	And when Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
LEV.11.1	Then the 
LEV.11.2	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.
LEV.11.2	“Of all the land animals, these are the ones you may use for food. 
LEV.11.3	You may eat any animal that has completely split hooves and chews the cud. 
LEV.11.4	You may not, however, eat the following animals
LEV.11.5	The hyrax
LEV.11.6	The hare chews the cud but does not have split hooves, so it is unclean. 
LEV.11.7	The pig has evenly split hooves but does not chew the cud, so it is unclean. 
LEV.11.8	You may not eat the meat of these animals or even touch their carcasses. They are ceremonially unclean for you.
LEV.11.9	“Of all the marine animals, these are ones you may use for food. You may eat anything from the water if it has both fins and scales, whether taken from salt water or from streams. 
LEV.11.10	But you must never eat animals from the sea or from rivers that do not have both fins and scales. They are detestable to you. This applies both to little creatures that live in shallow water and to all creatures that live in deep water. 
LEV.11.11	They will always be detestable to you. You must never eat their meat or even touch their dead bodies. 
LEV.11.12	Any marine animal that does not have both fins and scales is detestable to you.
LEV.11.13	“These are the birds that are detestable to you. You must never eat them: the griffon vulture, the bearded vulture, the black vulture, 
LEV.11.14	the kite, falcons of all kinds, 
LEV.11.15	ravens of all kinds, 
LEV.11.16	the eagle owl, the short-eared owl, the seagull, hawks of all kinds, 
LEV.11.17	the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, 
LEV.11.18	the barn owl, the desert owl, the Egyptian vulture, 
LEV.11.19	the stork, herons of all kinds, the hoopoe, and the bat.
LEV.11.20	“You must not eat winged insects that walk along the ground; they are detestable to you. 
LEV.11.21	You may, however, eat winged insects that walk along the ground and have jointed legs so they can jump. 
LEV.11.22	The insects you are permitted to eat include all kinds of locusts, bald locusts, crickets, and grasshoppers. 
LEV.11.23	All other winged insects that walk along the ground are detestable to you.
LEV.11.24	“The following creatures will make you ceremonially unclean. If any of you touch their carcasses, you will be defiled until evening. 
LEV.11.25	If you pick up their carcasses, you must wash your clothes, and you will remain defiled until evening.
LEV.11.26	“Any animal that has split hooves that are not evenly divided or that does not chew the cud is unclean for you. If you touch the carcass of such an animal, you will be defiled. 
LEV.11.27	Of the animals that walk on all fours, those that have paws are unclean. If you touch the carcass of such an animal, you will be defiled until evening. 
LEV.11.28	If you pick up its carcass, you must wash your clothes, and you will remain defiled until evening. These animals are unclean for you.
LEV.11.29	“Of the small animals that scurry along the ground, these are unclean for you: the mole rat, the rat, large lizards of all kinds, 
LEV.11.30	the gecko, the monitor lizard, the common lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon. 
LEV.11.31	All these small animals are unclean for you. If any of you touch the dead body of such an animal, you will be defiled until evening. 
LEV.11.32	If such an animal dies and falls on something, that object will be unclean. This is true whether the object is made of wood, cloth, leather, or burlap. Whatever its use, you must dip it in water, and it will remain defiled until evening. After that, it will be ceremonially clean and may be used again.
LEV.11.33	“If such an animal falls into a clay pot, everything in the pot will be defiled, and the pot must be smashed. 
LEV.11.34	If the water from such a container spills on any food, the food will be defiled. And any beverage in such a container will be defiled. 
LEV.11.35	Any object on which the carcass of such an animal falls will be defiled. If it is an oven or hearth, it must be destroyed, for it is defiled, and you must treat it accordingly.
LEV.11.36	“However, if the carcass of such an animal falls into a spring or a cistern, the water will still be clean. But anyone who touches the carcass will be defiled. 
LEV.11.37	If the carcass falls on seed grain to be planted in the field, the seed will still be considered clean. 
LEV.11.38	But if the seed is wet when the carcass falls on it, the seed will be defiled.
LEV.11.39	“If an animal you are permitted to eat dies and you touch its carcass, you will be defiled until evening. 
LEV.11.40	If you eat any of its meat or carry away its carcass, you must wash your clothes, and you will remain defiled until evening.
LEV.11.41	“All small animals that scurry along the ground are detestable, and you must never eat them. 
LEV.11.42	This includes all animals that slither along on their bellies, as well as those with four legs and those with many feet. All such animals that scurry along the ground are detestable, and you must never eat them. 
LEV.11.43	Do not defile yourselves by touching them. You must not make yourselves ceremonially unclean because of them. 
LEV.11.44	For I am the 
LEV.11.45	For I, the 
LEV.11.46	“These are the instructions regarding land animals, birds, marine creatures, and animals that scurry along the ground. 
LEV.11.47	By these instructions you will know what is unclean and clean, and which animals may be eaten and which may not be eaten.”
LEV.12.1	The 
LEV.12.2	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. If a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son, she will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her menstrual period. 
LEV.12.3	On the eighth day the boy’s foreskin must be circumcised. 
LEV.12.4	After waiting thirty-three days, she will be purified from the bleeding of childbirth. During this time of purification, she must not touch anything that is set apart as holy. And she must not enter the sanctuary until her time of purification is over. 
LEV.12.5	If a woman gives birth to a daughter, she will be ceremonially unclean for two weeks, just as she is unclean during her menstrual period. After waiting sixty-six days, she will be purified from the bleeding of childbirth.
LEV.12.6	“When the time of purification is completed for either a son or a daughter, the woman must bring a one-year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a purification offering. She must bring her offerings to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
LEV.12.7	The priest will then present them to the 
LEV.12.8	“If a woman cannot afford to bring a lamb, she must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons. One will be for the burnt offering and the other for the purification offering. The priest will sacrifice them to purify her, and she will be ceremonially clean.”
LEV.13.1	The 
LEV.13.2	“If anyone has a swelling or a rash or discolored skin that might develop into a serious skin disease,
LEV.13.3	The priest will examine the affected area of the skin. If the hair in the affected area has turned white and the problem appears to be more than skin-deep, it is a serious skin disease, and the priest who examines it must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean.
LEV.13.4	“But if the affected area of the skin is only a white discoloration and does not appear to be more than skin-deep, and if the hair on the spot has not turned white, the priest will quarantine the person for seven days. 
LEV.13.5	On the seventh day the priest will make another examination. If he finds the affected area has not changed and the problem has not spread on the skin, the priest will quarantine the person for seven more days. 
LEV.13.6	On the seventh day the priest will make another examination. If he finds the affected area has faded and has not spread, the priest will pronounce the person ceremonially clean. It was only a rash. The person’s clothing must be washed, and the person will be ceremonially clean. 
LEV.13.7	But if the rash continues to spread after the person has been examined by the priest and has been pronounced clean, the infected person must return to be examined again. 
LEV.13.8	If the priest finds that the rash has spread, he must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean, for it is indeed a skin disease.
LEV.13.9	“Anyone who develops a serious skin disease must go to the priest for an examination. 
LEV.13.10	If the priest finds a white swelling on the skin, and some hair on the spot has turned white, and there is an open sore in the affected area, 
LEV.13.11	it is a chronic skin disease, and the priest must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean. In such cases the person need not be quarantined, for it is obvious that the skin is defiled by the disease.
LEV.13.12	“Now suppose the disease has spread all over the person’s skin, covering the body from head to foot. 
LEV.13.13	When the priest examines the infected person and finds that the disease covers the entire body, he will pronounce the person ceremonially clean. Since the skin has turned completely white, the person is clean. 
LEV.13.14	But if any open sores appear, the infected person will be pronounced ceremonially unclean. 
LEV.13.15	The priest must make this pronouncement as soon as he sees an open sore, since open sores indicate the presence of a skin disease. 
LEV.13.16	However, if the open sores heal and turn white like the rest of the skin, the person must return to the priest 
LEV.13.17	for another examination. If the affected areas have indeed turned white, the priest will then pronounce the person ceremonially clean by declaring, ‘You are clean!’
LEV.13.18	“If anyone has a boil on the skin that has started to heal, 
LEV.13.19	but a white swelling or a reddish white spot develops in its place, that person must go to the priest to be examined. 
LEV.13.20	If the priest examines it and finds it to be more than skin-deep, and if the hair in the affected area has turned white, the priest must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean. The boil has become a serious skin disease. 
LEV.13.21	But if the priest finds no white hair on the affected area and the problem appears to be no more than skin-deep and has faded, the priest must quarantine the person for seven days. 
LEV.13.22	If during that time the affected area spreads on the skin, the priest must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean, because it is a serious disease. 
LEV.13.23	But if the area grows no larger and does not spread, it is merely the scar from the boil, and the priest will pronounce the person ceremonially clean.
LEV.13.24	“If anyone has suffered a burn on the skin and the burned area changes color, becoming either reddish white or shiny white, 
LEV.13.25	the priest must examine it. If he finds that the hair in the affected area has turned white and the problem appears to be more than skin-deep, a skin disease has broken out in the burn. The priest must then pronounce the person ceremonially unclean, for it is clearly a serious skin disease. 
LEV.13.26	But if the priest finds no white hair on the affected area and the problem appears to be no more than skin-deep and has faded, the priest must quarantine the infected person for seven days. 
LEV.13.27	On the seventh day the priest must examine the person again. If the affected area has spread on the skin, the priest must pronounce that person ceremonially unclean, for it is clearly a serious skin disease. 
LEV.13.28	But if the affected area has not changed or spread on the skin and has faded, it is simply a swelling from the burn. The priest will then pronounce the person ceremonially clean, for it is only the scar from the burn.
LEV.13.29	“If anyone, either a man or woman, has a sore on the head or chin, 
LEV.13.30	the priest must examine it. If he finds it is more than skin-deep and has fine yellow hair on it, the priest must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean. It is a scabby sore of the head or chin. 
LEV.13.31	If the priest examines the scabby sore and finds that it is only skin-deep but there is no black hair on it, he must quarantine the person for seven days. 
LEV.13.32	On the seventh day the priest must examine the sore again. If he finds that the scabby sore has not spread, and there is no yellow hair on it, and it appears to be only skin-deep, 
LEV.13.33	the person must shave off all hair except the hair on the affected area. Then the priest must quarantine the person for another seven days. 
LEV.13.34	On the seventh day he will examine the sore again. If it has not spread and appears to be no more than skin-deep, the priest will pronounce the person ceremonially clean. The person’s clothing must be washed, and the person will be ceremonially clean. 
LEV.13.35	But if the scabby sore begins to spread after the person is pronounced clean, 
LEV.13.36	the priest must do another examination. If he finds that the sore has spread, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair. The infected person is ceremonially unclean. 
LEV.13.37	But if the color of the scabby sore does not change and black hair has grown on it, it has healed. The priest will then pronounce the person ceremonially clean.
LEV.13.38	“If anyone, either a man or woman, has shiny white patches on the skin, 
LEV.13.39	the priest must examine the affected area. If he finds that the shiny patches are only pale white, this is a harmless skin rash, and the person is ceremonially clean.
LEV.13.40	“If a man loses his hair and his head becomes bald, he is still ceremonially clean. 
LEV.13.41	And if he loses hair on his forehead, he simply has a bald forehead; he is still clean. 
LEV.13.42	However, if a reddish white sore appears on the bald area on top of his head or on his forehead, this is a skin disease. 
LEV.13.43	The priest must examine him, and if he finds swelling around the reddish white sore anywhere on the man’s head and it looks like a skin disease, 
LEV.13.44	the man is indeed infected with a skin disease and is unclean. The priest must pronounce him ceremonially unclean because of the sore on his head.
LEV.13.45	“Those who suffer from a serious skin disease must tear their clothing and leave their hair uncombed.
LEV.13.46	As long as the serious disease lasts, they will be ceremonially unclean. They must live in isolation in their place outside the camp.
LEV.13.47	“Now suppose mildew
LEV.13.48	woolen or linen fabric, the hide of an animal, or anything made of leather. 
LEV.13.49	If the contaminated area in the clothing, the animal hide, the fabric, or the leather article has turned greenish or reddish, it is contaminated with mildew and must be shown to the priest. 
LEV.13.50	After examining the affected spot, the priest will put the article in quarantine for seven days. 
LEV.13.51	On the seventh day the priest must inspect it again. If the contaminated area has spread, the clothing or fabric or leather is clearly contaminated by a serious mildew and is ceremonially unclean. 
LEV.13.52	The priest must burn the item—the clothing, the woolen or linen fabric, or piece of leather—for it has been contaminated by a serious mildew. It must be completely destroyed by fire.
LEV.13.53	“But if the priest examines it and finds that the contaminated area has not spread in the clothing, the fabric, or the leather, 
LEV.13.54	the priest will order the object to be washed and then quarantined for seven more days. 
LEV.13.55	Then the priest must examine the object again. If he finds that the contaminated area has not changed color after being washed, even if it did not spread, the object is defiled. It must be completely burned up, whether the contaminated spot
LEV.13.56	But if the priest examines it and finds that the contaminated area has faded after being washed, he must cut the spot from the clothing, the fabric, or the leather. 
LEV.13.57	If the spot later reappears on the clothing, the fabric, or the leather article, the mildew is clearly spreading, and the contaminated object must be burned up. 
LEV.13.58	But if the spot disappears from the clothing, the fabric, or the leather article after it has been washed, it must be washed again; then it will be ceremonially clean.
LEV.13.59	“These are the instructions for dealing with mildew that contaminates woolen or linen clothing or fabric or anything made of leather. This is how the priest will determine whether these items are ceremonially clean or unclean.”
LEV.14.1	And the 
LEV.14.2	“The following instructions are for those seeking ceremonial purification from a skin disease.
LEV.14.3	who will examine them at a place outside the camp. If the priest finds that someone has been healed of a serious skin disease, 
LEV.14.4	he will perform a purification ceremony, using two live birds that are ceremonially clean, a stick of cedar,
LEV.14.5	The priest will order that one bird be slaughtered over a clay pot filled with fresh water. 
LEV.14.6	He will take the live bird, the cedar stick, the scarlet yarn, and the hyssop branch, and dip them into the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the fresh water. 
LEV.14.7	The priest will then sprinkle the blood of the dead bird seven times on the person being purified of the skin disease. When the priest has purified the person, he will release the live bird in the open field to fly away.
LEV.14.8	“The persons being purified must then wash their clothes, shave off all their hair, and bathe themselves in water. Then they will be ceremonially clean and may return to the camp. However, they must remain outside their tents for seven days. 
LEV.14.9	On the seventh day they must again shave all the hair from their heads, including the hair of the beard and eyebrows. They must also wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water. Then they will be ceremonially clean.
LEV.14.10	“On the eighth day each person being purified must bring two male lambs and a one-year-old female lamb, all with no defects, along with a grain offering of six quarts
LEV.14.11	Then the officiating priest will present that person for purification, along with the offerings, before the 
LEV.14.12	The priest will take one of the male lambs and the olive oil and present them as a guilt offering, lifting them up as a special offering before the 
LEV.14.13	He will then slaughter the male lamb in the sacred area where sin offerings and burnt offerings are slaughtered. As with the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest. It is a most holy offering. 
LEV.14.14	The priest will then take some of the blood of the guilt offering and apply it to the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified.
LEV.14.15	“Then the priest will pour some of the olive oil into the palm of his own left hand. 
LEV.14.16	He will dip his right finger into the oil in his palm and sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the 
LEV.14.17	The priest will then apply some of the oil in his palm over the blood from the guilt offering that is on the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified. 
LEV.14.18	The priest will apply the oil remaining in his hand to the head of the person being purified. Through this process, the priest will purify
LEV.14.19	“Then the priest must present the sin offering to purify the person who was cured of the skin disease. After that, the priest will slaughter the burnt offering 
LEV.14.20	and offer it on the altar along with the grain offering. Through this process, the priest will purify the person who was healed, and the person will be ceremonially clean.
LEV.14.21	“But anyone who is too poor and cannot afford these offerings may bring one male lamb for a guilt offering, to be lifted up as a special offering for purification. The person must also bring two quarts
LEV.14.22	The offering must also include two turtledoves or two young pigeons, whichever the person can afford. One of the pair must be used for the sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. 
LEV.14.23	On the eighth day of the purification ceremony, the person being purified must bring the offerings to the priest in the

LEV.14.26	“The priest will also pour some of the olive oil into the palm of his own left hand. 
LEV.14.27	He will dip his right finger into the oil in his palm and sprinkle some of it seven times before the 
LEV.14.28	The priest will then apply some of the oil in his palm over the blood from the guilt offering that is on the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified. 
LEV.14.29	The priest will apply the oil remaining in his hand to the head of the person being purified. Through this process, the priest will purify the person before the

LEV.14.31	One of them is for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, to be presented along with the grain offering. Through this process, the priest will purify the person before the 
LEV.14.32	These are the instructions for purification for those who have recovered from a serious skin disease but who cannot afford to bring the offerings normally required for the ceremony of purification.”
LEV.14.33	Then the 
LEV.14.34	“When you arrive in Canaan, the land I am giving you as your own possession, I may contaminate some of the houses in your land with mildew.
LEV.14.35	The owner of such a house must then go to the priest and say, ‘It appears that my house has some kind of mildew.’ 
LEV.14.36	Before the priest goes in to inspect the house, he must have the house emptied so nothing inside will be pronounced ceremonially unclean. 
LEV.14.37	Then the priest will go in and examine the mildew on the walls. If he finds greenish or reddish streaks and the contamination appears to go deeper than the wall’s surface, 
LEV.14.38	the priest will step outside the door and put the house in quarantine for seven days. 
LEV.14.39	On the seventh day the priest must return for another inspection. If he finds that the mildew on the walls of the house has spread, 
LEV.14.40	the priest must order that the stones from those areas be removed. The contaminated material will then be taken outside the town to an area designated as ceremonially unclean. 
LEV.14.41	Next the inside walls of the entire house must be scraped thoroughly and the scrapings dumped in the unclean place outside the town. 
LEV.14.42	Other stones will be brought in to replace the ones that were removed, and the walls will be replastered.
LEV.14.43	“But if the mildew reappears after all the stones have been replaced and the house has been scraped and replastered, 
LEV.14.44	the priest must return and inspect the house again. If he finds that the mildew has spread, the walls are clearly contaminated with a serious mildew, and the house is defiled. 
LEV.14.45	It must be torn down, and all its stones, timbers, and plaster must be carried out of town to the place designated as ceremonially unclean. 
LEV.14.46	Those who enter the house during the period of quarantine will be ceremonially unclean until evening, 
LEV.14.47	and all who sleep or eat in the house must wash their clothing.
LEV.14.48	“But if the priest returns for his inspection and finds that the mildew has not reappeared in the house after the fresh plastering, he will pronounce it clean because the mildew is clearly gone. 
LEV.14.49	To purify the house the priest must take two birds, a stick of cedar, some scarlet yarn, and a hyssop branch. 
LEV.14.50	He will slaughter one of the birds over a clay pot filled with fresh water. 
LEV.14.51	He will take the cedar stick, the hyssop branch, the scarlet yarn, and the live bird, and dip them into the blood of the slaughtered bird and into the fresh water. Then he will sprinkle the house seven times.

LEV.24.10	One day a man who had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father came out of his tent and got into a fight with one of the Israelite men. 
LEV.24.11	During the fight, this son of an Israelite woman blasphemed the Name of the 
LEV.24.12	They kept the man in custody until the 
LEV.24.13	Then the 
LEV.24.14	“Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and tell all those who heard the curse to lay their hands on his head. Then let the entire community stone him to death.

LEV.24.16	Anyone who blasphemes the Name of the 
LEV.24.17	“Anyone who takes another person’s life must be put to death.
LEV.24.18	“Anyone who kills another person’s animal must pay for it in full—a live animal for the animal that was killed.
LEV.24.19	“Anyone who injures another person must be dealt with according to the injury inflicted—
LEV.24.20	a fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Whatever anyone does to injure another person must be paid back in kind.
LEV.24.21	“Whoever kills an animal must pay for it in full, but whoever kills another person must be put to death.
LEV.24.22	“This same standard applies both to native-born Israelites and to the foreigners living among you. I am the 
LEV.24.23	After Moses gave all these instructions to the Israelites, they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him to death. The Israelites did just as the 
LEV.25.1	While Moses was on Mount Sinai, the 
LEV.25.2	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. When you have entered the land I am giving you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath rest before the 
LEV.25.3	For six years you may plant your fields and prune your vineyards and harvest your crops, 
LEV.25.4	but during the seventh year the land must have a Sabbath year of complete rest. It is the 
LEV.25.5	And don’t store away the crops that grow on their own or gather the grapes from your unpruned vines. The land must have a year of complete rest. 
LEV.25.6	But you may eat whatever the land produces on its own during its Sabbath. This applies to you, your male and female servants, your hired workers, and the temporary residents who live with you. 
LEV.25.7	Your livestock and the wild animals in your land will also be allowed to eat what the land produces.
LEV.25.8	“In addition, you must count off seven Sabbath years, seven sets of seven years, adding up to forty-nine years in all. 
LEV.25.9	Then on the Day of Atonement in the fiftieth year,
LEV.25.10	Set this year apart as holy, a time to proclaim freedom throughout the land for all who live there. It will be a jubilee year for you, when each of you may return to the land that belonged to your ancestors and return to your own clan. 
LEV.25.11	This fiftieth year will be a jubilee for you. During that year you must not plant your fields or store away any of the crops that grow on their own, and don’t gather the grapes from your unpruned vines. 
LEV.25.12	It will be a jubilee year for you, and you must keep it holy. But you may eat whatever the land produces on its own. 
LEV.25.13	In the Year of Jubilee each of you may return to the land that belonged to your ancestors.
LEV.25.14	“When you make an agreement with your neighbor to buy or sell property, you must not take advantage of each other. 
LEV.25.15	When you buy land from your neighbor, the price you pay must be based on the number of years since the last jubilee. The seller must set the price by taking into account the number of years remaining until the next Year of Jubilee. 
LEV.25.16	The more years until the next jubilee, the higher the price; the fewer years, the lower the price. After all, the person selling the land is actually selling you a certain number of harvests. 
LEV.25.17	Show your fear of God by not taking advantage of each other. I am the 
LEV.25.18	“If you want to live securely in the land, follow my decrees and obey my regulations. 
LEV.25.19	Then the land will yield large crops, and you will eat your fill and live securely in it. 
LEV.25.20	But you might ask, ‘What will we eat during the seventh year, since we are not allowed to plant or harvest crops that year?’ 
LEV.25.21	Be assured that I will send my blessing for you in the sixth year, so the land will produce a crop large enough for three years. 
LEV.25.22	When you plant your fields in the eighth year, you will still be eating from the large crop of the sixth year. In fact, you will still be eating from that large crop when the new crop is harvested in the ninth year.
LEV.25.23	“The land must never be sold on a permanent basis, for the land belongs to me. You are only foreigners and tenant farmers working for me.
LEV.25.24	“With every purchase of land you must grant the seller the right to buy it back. 
LEV.25.25	If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and is forced to sell some family land, then a close relative should buy it back for him. 
LEV.25.26	If there is no close relative to buy the land, but the person who sold it gets enough money to buy it back, 
LEV.25.27	he then has the right to redeem it from the one who bought it. The price of the land will be discounted according to the number of years until the next Year of Jubilee. In this way the original owner can then return to the land. 
LEV.25.28	But if the original owner cannot afford to buy back the land, it will remain with the new owner until the next Year of Jubilee. In the jubilee year, the land must be returned to the original owners so they can return to their family land.
LEV.25.29	“Anyone who sells a house inside a walled town has the right to buy it back for a full year after its sale. During that year, the seller retains the right to buy it back. 
LEV.25.30	But if it is not bought back within a year, the sale of the house within the walled town cannot be reversed. It will become the permanent property of the buyer. It will not be returned to the original owner in the Year of Jubilee. 
LEV.25.31	But a house in a village—a settlement without fortified walls—will be treated like property in the countryside. Such a house may be bought back at any time, and it must be returned to the original owner in the Year of Jubilee.
LEV.25.32	“The Levites always have the right to buy back a house they have sold within the towns allotted to them. 
LEV.25.33	And any property that is sold by the Levites—all houses within the Levitical towns—must be returned in the Year of Jubilee. After all, the houses in the towns reserved for the Levites are the only property they own in all Israel. 
LEV.25.34	The open pastureland around the Levitical towns may never be sold. It is their permanent possession.
LEV.25.35	“If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and cannot support himself, support him as you would a foreigner or a temporary resident and allow him to live with you. 
LEV.25.36	Do not charge interest or make a profit at his expense. Instead, show your fear of God by letting him live with you as your relative. 
LEV.25.37	Remember, do not charge interest on money you lend him or make a profit on food you sell him. 
LEV.25.38	I am the 
LEV.25.39	“If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and is forced to sell himself to you, do not treat him as a slave. 
LEV.25.40	Treat him instead as a hired worker or as a temporary resident who lives with you, and he will serve you only until the Year of Jubilee. 
LEV.25.41	At that time he and his children will no longer be obligated to you, and they will return to their clans and go back to the land originally allotted to their ancestors. 
LEV.25.42	The people of Israel are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, so they must never be sold as slaves. 
LEV.25.43	Show your fear of God by not treating them harshly.
LEV.25.44	“However, you may purchase male and female slaves from among the nations around you. 
LEV.25.45	You may also purchase the children of temporary residents who live among you, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, 
LEV.25.46	passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat them as slaves, but you must never treat your fellow Israelites this way.
LEV.25.47	“Suppose a foreigner or temporary resident becomes rich while living among you. If any of your fellow Israelites fall into poverty and are forced to sell themselves to such a foreigner or to a member of his family, 
LEV.25.48	they still retain the right to be bought back, even after they have been purchased. They may be bought back by a brother, 
LEV.25.49	an uncle, or a cousin. In fact, anyone from the extended family may buy them back. They may also redeem themselves if they have prospered. 
LEV.25.50	They will negotiate the price of their freedom with the person who bought them. The price will be based on the number of years from the time they were sold until the next Year of Jubilee—whatever it would cost to hire a worker for that period of time. 
LEV.25.51	If many years still remain until the jubilee, they will repay the proper proportion of what they received when they sold themselves. 
LEV.25.52	If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they will repay a small amount for their redemption. 
LEV.25.53	The foreigner must treat them as workers hired on a yearly basis. You must not allow a foreigner to treat any of your fellow Israelites harshly. 
LEV.25.54	If any Israelites have not been bought back by the time the Year of Jubilee arrives, they and their children must be set free at that time. 
LEV.25.55	For the people of Israel belong to me. They are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am the 
LEV.26.1	“Do not make idols or set up carved images, or sacred pillars, or sculptured stones in your land so you may worship them. I am the 
LEV.26.2	You must keep my Sabbath days of rest and show reverence for my sanctuary. I am the 
LEV.26.3	“If you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands, 
LEV.26.4	I will send you the seasonal rains. The land will then yield its crops, and the trees of the field will produce their fruit. 
LEV.26.5	Your threshing season will overlap with the grape harvest, and your grape harvest will overlap with the season of planting grain. You will eat your fill and live securely in your own land.
LEV.26.6	“I will give you peace in the land, and you will be able to sleep with no cause for fear. I will rid the land of wild animals and keep your enemies out of your land. 
LEV.26.7	In fact, you will chase down your enemies and slaughter them with your swords. 
LEV.26.8	Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand! All your enemies will fall beneath your sword.
LEV.26.9	“I will look favorably upon you, making you fertile and multiplying your people. And I will fulfill my covenant with you. 
LEV.26.10	You will have such a surplus of crops that you will need to clear out the old grain to make room for the new harvest! 
LEV.26.11	I will live among you, and I will not despise you. 
LEV.26.12	I will walk among you; I will be your God, and you will be my people. 
LEV.26.13	I am the 
LEV.26.14	“However, if you do not listen to me or obey all these commands, 
LEV.26.15	and if you break my covenant by rejecting my decrees, treating my regulations with contempt, and refusing to obey my commands, 
LEV.26.16	I will punish you. I will bring sudden terrors upon you—wasting diseases and burning fevers that will cause your eyes to fail and your life to ebb away. You will plant your crops in vain because your enemies will eat them. 
LEV.26.17	I will turn against you, and you will be defeated by your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you, and you will run even when no one is chasing you!
LEV.26.18	“And if, in spite of all this, you still disobey me, I will punish you seven times over for your sins. 
LEV.26.19	I will break your proud spirit by making the skies as unyielding as iron and the earth as hard as bronze. 
LEV.26.20	All your work will be for nothing, for your land will yield no crops, and your trees will bear no fruit.
LEV.26.21	“If even then you remain hostile toward me and refuse to obey me, I will inflict disaster on you seven times over for your sins. 
LEV.26.22	I will send wild animals that will rob you of your children and destroy your livestock. Your numbers will dwindle, and your roads will be deserted.
LEV.26.23	“And if you fail to learn the lesson and continue your hostility toward me, 
LEV.26.24	then I myself will be hostile toward you. I will personally strike you with calamity seven times over for your sins. 
LEV.26.25	I will send armies against you to carry out the curse of the covenant you have broken. When you run to your towns for safety, I will send a plague to destroy you there, and you will be handed over to your enemies. 
LEV.26.26	I will destroy your food supply, so that ten women will need only one oven to bake bread for their families. They will ration your food by weight, and though you have food to eat, you will not be satisfied.
LEV.26.27	“If in spite of all this you still refuse to listen and still remain hostile toward me, 
LEV.26.28	then I will give full vent to my hostility. I myself will punish you seven times over for your sins. 
LEV.26.29	Then you will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters. 
LEV.26.30	I will destroy your pagan shrines and knock down your places of worship. I will leave your lifeless corpses piled on top of your lifeless idols,
LEV.26.31	I will make your cities desolate and destroy your places of pagan worship. I will take no pleasure in your offerings that should be a pleasing aroma to me. 
LEV.26.32	Yes, I myself will devastate your land, and your enemies who come to occupy it will be appalled at what they see. 
LEV.26.33	I will scatter you among the nations and bring out my sword against you. Your land will become desolate, and your cities will lie in ruins. 
LEV.26.34	Then at last the land will enjoy its neglected Sabbath years as it lies desolate while you are in exile in the land of your enemies. Then the land will finally rest and enjoy the Sabbaths it missed. 
LEV.26.35	As long as the land lies in ruins, it will enjoy the rest you never allowed it to take every seventh year while you lived in it.
LEV.26.36	“And for those of you who survive, I will demoralize you in the land of your enemies. You will live in such fear that the sound of a leaf driven by the wind will send you fleeing. You will run as though fleeing from a sword, and you will fall even when no one pursues you. 
LEV.26.37	Though no one is chasing you, you will stumble over each other as though fleeing from a sword. You will have no power to stand up against your enemies. 
LEV.26.38	You will die among the foreign nations and be devoured in the land of your enemies. 
LEV.26.39	Those of you who survive will waste away in your enemies’ lands because of their sins and the sins of their ancestors.
LEV.26.40	“But at last my people will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors for betraying me and being hostile toward me. 
LEV.26.41	When I have turned their hostility back on them and brought them to the land of their enemies, then at last their stubborn hearts will be humbled, and they will pay for their sins. 
LEV.26.42	Then I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. 
LEV.26.43	For the land must be abandoned to enjoy its years of Sabbath rest as it lies deserted. At last the people will pay for their sins, for they have continually rejected my regulations and despised my decrees.
LEV.26.44	“But despite all this, I will not utterly reject or despise them while they are in exile in the land of their enemies. I will not cancel my covenant with them by wiping them out, for I am the

LEV.27.11	If your vow involves an unclean animal—one that is not acceptable as an offering to the 
LEV.27.12	He will assess its value, and his assessment will be final, whether high or low.

LEV.27.19	If the person who dedicated the field wants to buy it back, he must pay the value set by the priest, plus 20 percent. Then the field will again be legally his. 
LEV.27.20	But if he does not want to buy it back, and it is sold to someone else, the field can no longer be bought back. 
LEV.27.21	When the field is released in the Year of Jubilee, it will be holy, a field specially set apart

NUM.1.16	These are the chosen leaders of the community, the leaders of their ancestral tribes, the heads of the clans of Israel.”
NUM.1.17	So Moses and Aaron called together these chosen leaders, 
NUM.1.18	and they assembled the whole community of Israel on that very day.

NUM.1.42+NUM.1.43	53,400
NUM.1.44	These were the men registered by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, all listed according to their ancestral descent. 
NUM.1.45	They were registered by families—all the men of Israel who were twenty years old or older and able to go to war. 
NUM.1.46	The total number was 603,550.
NUM.1.47	But this total did not include the Levites. 
NUM.1.48	For the 
NUM.1.49	“Do not include the tribe of Levi in the registration; do not count them with the rest of the Israelites. 
NUM.1.50	Put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant,
NUM.1.51	Whenever it is time for the Tabernacle to move, the Levites will take it down. And when it is time to stop, they will set it up again. But any unauthorized person who goes too near the Tabernacle must be put to death. 
NUM.1.52	Each tribe of Israel will camp in a designated area with its own family banner. 
NUM.1.53	But the Levites will camp around the Tabernacle of the Covenant to protect the community of Israel from the 
NUM.1.54	So the Israelites did everything just as the 
NUM.2.1	Then the 
NUM.2.2	“When the Israelites set up camp, each tribe will be assigned its own area. The tribal divisions will camp beneath their family banners on all four sides of the Tabernacle,
NUM.2.3+NUM.2.4	“The divisions of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun are to camp toward the sunrise on the east side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops:

NUM.2.7+NUM.2.8	57,400
NUM.2.9	So the total of all the troops on Judah’s side of the camp is 186,400. These three tribes are to lead the way whenever the Israelites travel to a new campsite.
NUM.2.10+NUM.2.11	“The divisions of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad are to camp on the south side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops:

NUM.2.16	So the total of all the troops on Reuben’s side of the camp is 151,450. These three tribes will be second in line whenever the Israelites travel.
NUM.2.17	“Then the Tabernacle, carried by the Levites, will set out from the middle of the camp. All the tribes are to travel in the same order that they camp, each in position under the appropriate family banner.

NUM.2.31	So the total of all the troops on Dan’s side of the camp is 157,600. These three tribes will be last, marching under their banners whenever the Israelites travel.”
NUM.2.32	In summary, the troops of Israel listed by their families totaled 603,550. 
NUM.2.33	But as the 
NUM.2.34	So the people of Israel did everything as the 
NUM.3.1	This is the family line of Aaron and Moses as it was recorded when the 
NUM.3.2	The names of Aaron’s sons were Nadab (the oldest), Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
NUM.3.3	These sons of Aaron were anointed and ordained to minister as priests. 
NUM.3.4	But Nadab and Abihu died in the 
NUM.3.5	Then the 
NUM.3.6	“Call forward the tribe of Levi, and present them to Aaron the priest to serve as his assistants. 
NUM.3.7	They will serve Aaron and the whole community, performing their sacred duties in and around the Tabernacle.
NUM.3.8	They will also maintain all the furnishings of the sacred tent,
NUM.3.9	Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons. They have been given from among all the people of Israel to serve as their assistants. 
NUM.3.10	Appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood. But any unauthorized person who goes too near the sanctuary must be put to death.”
NUM.3.11	And the 
NUM.3.12	“Look, I have chosen the Levites from among the Israelites to serve as substitutes for all the firstborn sons of the people of Israel. The Levites belong to me, 
NUM.3.13	for all the firstborn males are mine. On the day I struck down all the firstborn sons of the Egyptians, I set apart for myself all the firstborn in Israel, both of people and of animals. They are mine; I am the 
NUM.3.14	The 
NUM.3.15	“Record the names of the members of the tribe of Levi by their families and clans. List every male who is one month old or older.” 
NUM.3.16	So Moses listed them, just as the 
NUM.3.17	Levi had three sons, whose names were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
NUM.3.18	The clans descended from Gershon were named after two of his descendants, Libni and Shimei.
NUM.3.19	The clans descended from Kohath were named after four of his descendants, Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
NUM.3.20	The clans descended from Merari were named after two of his descendants, Mahli and Mushi.
NUM.3.20	These were the Levite clans, listed according to their family groups.
NUM.3.21	The descendants of Gershon were composed of the clans descended from Libni and Shimei. 
NUM.3.22	There were 7,500 males one month old or older among these Gershonite clans. 
NUM.3.23	They were assigned the area to the west of the Tabernacle for their camp. 
NUM.3.24	The leader of the Gershonite clans was Eliasaph son of Lael. 
NUM.3.25	These two clans were responsible to care for the Tabernacle, including the sacred tent with its layers of coverings, the curtain at its entrance, 
NUM.3.26	the curtains of the courtyard that surrounded the Tabernacle and altar, the curtain at the courtyard entrance, the ropes, and all the equipment related to their use.
NUM.3.27	The descendants of Kohath were composed of the clans descended from Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
NUM.3.28	There were 8,600
NUM.3.29	and they were assigned the area south of the Tabernacle for their camp. 
NUM.3.30	The leader of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel. 
NUM.3.31	These four clans were responsible for the care of the Ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the various articles used in the sanctuary, the inner curtain, and all the equipment related to their use. 
NUM.3.32	Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, was the chief administrator over all the Levites, with special responsibility for the oversight of the sanctuary.
NUM.3.33	The descendants of Merari were composed of the clans descended from Mahli and Mushi. 
NUM.3.34	There were 6,200 males one month old or older among these Merarite clans. 
NUM.3.35	They were assigned the area north of the Tabernacle for their camp. The leader of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail. 
NUM.3.36	These two clans were responsible for the care of the frames supporting the Tabernacle, the crossbars, the pillars, the bases, and all the equipment related to their use. 
NUM.3.37	They were also responsible for the posts of the courtyard and all their bases, pegs, and ropes.
NUM.3.38	The area in front of the Tabernacle, in the east toward the sunrise,
NUM.3.39	When Moses and Aaron counted the Levite clans at the 
NUM.3.40	Then the 
NUM.3.41	The Levites must be reserved for me as substitutes for the firstborn sons of Israel; I am the 
NUM.3.42	So Moses counted the firstborn sons of the people of Israel, just as the 
NUM.3.43	The number of firstborn sons who were one month old or older was 22,273.
NUM.3.44	Then the 
NUM.3.45	“Take the Levites as substitutes for the firstborn sons of the people of Israel. And take the livestock of the Levites as substitutes for the firstborn livestock of the people of Israel. The Levites belong to me; I am the 
NUM.3.46	There are 273 more firstborn sons of Israel than there are Levites. To redeem these extra firstborn sons, 
NUM.3.47	collect five pieces of silver
NUM.3.48	Give the silver to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for the extra firstborn sons.”
NUM.3.49	So Moses collected the silver for redeeming the firstborn sons of Israel who exceeded the number of Levites. 
NUM.3.50	He collected 1,365 pieces of silver
NUM.3.51	And Moses gave the silver for the redemption to Aaron and his sons, just as the 
NUM.4.1	Then the 
NUM.4.2	“Record the names of the members of the clans and families of the Kohathite division of the tribe of Levi. 
NUM.4.3	List all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are eligible to serve in the Tabernacle.
NUM.4.4	“The duties of the Kohathites at the Tabernacle will relate to the most sacred objects. 
NUM.4.5	When the camp moves, Aaron and his sons must enter the Tabernacle first to take down the inner curtain and cover the Ark of the Covenant
NUM.4.6	Then they must cover the inner curtain with fine goatskin leather and spread over that a single piece of blue cloth. Finally, they must put the carrying poles of the Ark in place.
NUM.4.7	“Next they must spread a blue cloth over the table where the Bread of the Presence is displayed, and on the cloth they will place the bowls, ladles, jars, pitchers, and the special bread. 
NUM.4.8	They must spread a scarlet cloth over all of this, and finally a covering of fine goatskin leather on top of the scarlet cloth. Then they must insert the carrying poles into the table.
NUM.4.9	“Next they must cover the lampstand with a blue cloth, along with its lamps, lamp snuffers, trays, and special jars of olive oil. 
NUM.4.10	Then they must cover the lampstand and its accessories with fine goatskin leather and place the bundle on a carrying frame.
NUM.4.11	“Next they must spread a blue cloth over the gold incense altar and cover this cloth with fine goatskin leather. Then they must attach the carrying poles to the altar. 
NUM.4.12	They must take all the remaining furnishings of the sanctuary and wrap them in a blue cloth, cover them with fine goatskin leather, and place them on the carrying frame.
NUM.4.13	“They must remove the ashes from the altar for sacrifices and cover the altar with a purple cloth. 
NUM.4.14	All the altar utensils—the firepans, meat forks, shovels, basins, and all the containers—must be placed on the cloth, and a covering of fine goatskin leather must be spread over them. Finally, they must put the carrying poles in place. 
NUM.4.15	The camp will be ready to move when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the sacred articles. The Kohathites will come and carry these things to the next destination. But they must not touch the sacred objects, or they will die. So these are the things from the Tabernacle that the Kohathites must carry.
NUM.4.16	“Eleazar son of Aaron the priest will be responsible for the oil of the lampstand, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil. In fact, Eleazar will be responsible for the entire Tabernacle and everything in it, including the sanctuary and its furnishings.”
NUM.4.17	Then the 
NUM.4.18	“Do not let the Kohathite clans be destroyed from among the Levites! 
NUM.4.19	This is what you must do so they will live and not die when they approach the most sacred objects. Aaron and his sons must always go in with them and assign a specific duty or load to each person. 
NUM.4.20	The Kohathites must never enter the sanctuary to look at the sacred objects for even a moment, or they will die.”
NUM.4.21	And the 
NUM.4.22	“Record the names of the members of the clans and families of the Gershonite division of the tribe of Levi. 
NUM.4.23	List all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are eligible to serve in the Tabernacle.
NUM.4.24	“These Gershonite clans will be responsible for general service and carrying loads. 
NUM.4.25	They must carry the curtains of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle itself with its coverings, the outer covering of fine goatskin leather, and the curtain for the Tabernacle entrance. 
NUM.4.26	They are also to carry the curtains for the courtyard walls that surround the Tabernacle and altar, the curtain across the courtyard entrance, the ropes, and all the equipment related to their use. The Gershonites are responsible for all these items. 
NUM.4.27	Aaron and his sons will direct the Gershonites regarding all their duties, whether it involves moving the equipment or doing other work. They must assign the Gershonites responsibility for the loads they are to carry. 
NUM.4.28	So these are the duties assigned to the Gershonite clans at the Tabernacle. They will be directly responsible to Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
NUM.4.29	“Now record the names of the members of the clans and families of the Merarite division of the tribe of Levi. 
NUM.4.30	List all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are eligible to serve in the Tabernacle.
NUM.4.31	“Their only duty at the Tabernacle will be to carry loads. They will carry the frames of the Tabernacle, the crossbars, the posts, and the bases; 
NUM.4.32	also the posts for the courtyard walls with their bases, pegs, and ropes; and all the accessories and everything else related to their use. Assign the various loads to each man by name. 
NUM.4.33	So these are the duties of the Merarite clans at the Tabernacle. They are directly responsible to Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.”
NUM.4.34	So Moses, Aaron, and the other leaders of the community listed the members of the Kohathite division by their clans and families. 
NUM.4.35	The list included all the men between thirty and fifty years of age who were eligible for service in the Tabernacle, 
NUM.4.36	and the total number came to 2,750. 
NUM.4.37	So this was the total of all those from the Kohathite clans who were eligible to serve at the Tabernacle. Moses and Aaron listed them, just as the 
NUM.4.38	The Gershonite division was also listed by its clans and families. 
NUM.4.39	The list included all the men between thirty and fifty years of age who were eligible for service in the Tabernacle, 
NUM.4.40	and the total number came to 2,630. 
NUM.4.41	So this was the total of all those from the Gershonite clans who were eligible to serve at the Tabernacle. Moses and Aaron listed them, just as the 
NUM.4.42	The Merarite division was also listed by its clans and families. 
NUM.4.43	The list included all the men between thirty and fifty years of age who were eligible for service in the Tabernacle, 
NUM.4.44	and the total number came to 3,200. 
NUM.4.45	So this was the total of all those from the Merarite clans who were eligible for service. Moses and Aaron listed them, just as the 
NUM.4.46	So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel listed all the Levites by their clans and families. 
NUM.4.47	All the men between thirty and fifty years of age who were eligible for service in the Tabernacle and for its transportation 
NUM.4.48	numbered 8,580. 
NUM.4.49	When their names were recorded, as the 
NUM.4.49	And so the registration was completed, just as the 
NUM.5.1	The 
NUM.5.2	“Command the people of Israel to remove from the camp anyone who has a skin disease
NUM.5.3	This command applies to men and women alike. Remove them so they will not defile the camp in which I live among them.” 
NUM.5.4	So the Israelites did as the 
NUM.5.5	Then the 
NUM.5.6	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel: If any of the people—men or women—betray the 
NUM.5.7	They must confess their sin and make full restitution for what they have done, adding an additional 20 percent and returning it to the person who was wronged. 
NUM.5.8	But if the person who was wronged is dead, and there are no near relatives to whom restitution can be made, the payment belongs to the 
NUM.5.9	All the sacred offerings that the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him. 
NUM.5.10	Each priest may keep all the sacred donations that he receives.”
NUM.5.11	And the 
NUM.5.12	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.
NUM.5.12	“Suppose a man’s wife goes astray, and she is unfaithful to her husband 
NUM.5.13	and has sex with another man, but neither her husband nor anyone else knows about it. She has defiled herself, even though there was no witness and she was not caught in the act. 
NUM.5.14	If her husband becomes jealous and is suspicious of his wife and needs to know whether or not she has defiled herself, 
NUM.5.15	the husband must bring his wife to the priest. He must also bring an offering of two quarts
NUM.5.16	“The priest will then present her to stand trial before the 
NUM.5.17	He must take some holy water in a clay jar and pour into it dust he has taken from the Tabernacle floor. 
NUM.5.18	When the priest has presented the woman before the 
NUM.5.19	The priest will then put the woman under oath and say to her, ‘If no other man has had sex with you, and you have not gone astray and defiled yourself while under your husband’s authority, may you be immune from the effects of this bitter water that brings on the curse. 
NUM.5.20	But if you have gone astray by being unfaithful to your husband, and have defiled yourself by having sex with another man—’
NUM.5.21	“At this point the priest must put the woman under oath by saying, ‘May the people know that the 
NUM.5.22	Now may this water that brings the curse enter your body and cause your abdomen to swell and your womb to shrivel.
NUM.5.23	And the priest will write these curses on a piece of leather and wash them off into the bitter water. 
NUM.5.24	He will make the woman drink the bitter water that brings on the curse. When the water enters her body, it will cause bitter suffering if she is guilty.
NUM.5.25	“The priest will take the jealousy offering from the woman’s hand, lift it up before the 
NUM.5.26	He will take a handful of the flour as a token portion and burn it on the altar, and he will require the woman to drink the water. 
NUM.5.27	If she has defiled herself by being unfaithful to her husband, the water that brings on the curse will cause bitter suffering. Her abdomen will swell and her womb will shrink,
NUM.5.28	But if she has not defiled herself and is pure, then she will be unharmed and will still be able to have children.
NUM.5.29	“This is the ritual law for dealing with suspicion. If a woman goes astray and defiles herself while under her husband’s authority, 
NUM.5.30	or if a man becomes jealous and is suspicious that his wife has been unfaithful, the husband must present his wife before the 
NUM.5.31	The husband will be innocent of any guilt in this matter, but his wife will be held accountable for her sin.”
NUM.6.1	Then the 
NUM.6.2	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.
NUM.6.2	“If any of the people, either men or women, take the special vow of a Nazirite, setting themselves apart to the 
NUM.6.3	they must give up wine and other alcoholic drinks. They must not use vinegar made from wine or from other alcoholic drinks, they must not drink fresh grape juice, and they must not eat grapes or raisins. 
NUM.6.4	As long as they are bound by their Nazirite vow, they are not allowed to eat or drink anything that comes from a grapevine—not even the grape seeds or skins.
NUM.6.5	“They must never cut their hair throughout the time of their vow, for they are holy and set apart to the 
NUM.6.6	And they must not go near a dead body during the entire period of their vow to the 
NUM.6.7	Even if the dead person is their own father, mother, brother, or sister, they must not defile themselves, for the hair on their head is the symbol of their separation to God. 
NUM.6.8	This requirement applies as long as they are set apart to the 
NUM.6.9	“If someone falls dead beside them, the hair they have dedicated will be defiled. They must wait for seven days and then shave their heads. Then they will be cleansed from their defilement. 
NUM.6.10	On the eighth day they must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
NUM.6.11	The priest will offer one of the birds for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. In this way, he will purify them
NUM.6.12	The days of their vow that were completed before their defilement no longer count. They must rededicate themselves to the 
NUM.6.13	“This is the ritual law for Nazirites. At the conclusion of their time of separation as Nazirites, they must each go to the entrance of the Tabernacle 
NUM.6.14	and offer their sacrifices to the 
NUM.6.15	a basket of bread made without yeast—cakes of choice flour mixed with olive oil and wafers spread with olive oil—along with their prescribed grain offerings and liquid offerings. 
NUM.6.16	The priest will present these offerings before the 
NUM.6.17	then the ram for a peace offering, along with the basket of bread made without yeast. The priest must also present the prescribed grain offering and liquid offering to the 
NUM.6.18	“Then the Nazirites will shave their heads at the entrance of the Tabernacle. They will take the hair that had been dedicated and place it on the fire beneath the peace-offering sacrifice. 
NUM.6.19	After the Nazirite’s head has been shaved, the priest will take for each of them the boiled shoulder of the ram, and he will take from the basket a cake and a wafer made without yeast. He will put them all into the Nazirite’s hands. 
NUM.6.20	Then the priest will lift them up as a special offering before the 
NUM.6.21	“This is the ritual law of the Nazirites, who vow to bring these offerings to the 
NUM.6.22	Then the 
NUM.6.23	“Tell Aaron and his sons to bless the people of Israel with this special blessing:
NUM.6.24	‘May the 
NUM.6.24	and protect you.
NUM.6.25	May the 
NUM.6.25	and be gracious to you.
NUM.6.26	May the 
NUM.6.26	and give you his peace.’
NUM.6.27	Whenever Aaron and his sons bless the people of Israel in my name, I myself will bless them.”
NUM.7.1	On the day Moses set up the Tabernacle, he anointed it and set it apart as holy. He also anointed and set apart all its furnishings and the altar with its utensils. 
NUM.7.2	Then the leaders of Israel—the tribal leaders who had registered the troops—came and brought their offerings. 
NUM.7.3	Together they brought six large wagons and twelve oxen. There was a wagon for every two leaders and an ox for each leader. They presented these to the 
NUM.7.4	Then the 
NUM.7.5	“Receive their gifts, and use these oxen and wagons for transporting the Tabernacle.
NUM.7.6	So Moses took the wagons and oxen and presented them to the Levites. 
NUM.7.7	He gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonite division for their work, 
NUM.7.8	and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarite division for their work. All their work was done under the leadership of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. 
NUM.7.9	But he gave none of the wagons or oxen to the Kohathite division, since they were required to carry the sacred objects of the Tabernacle on their shoulders.
NUM.7.10	The leaders also presented dedication gifts for the altar at the time it was anointed. They each placed their gifts before the altar. 
NUM.7.11	The 
NUM.7.12	On the first day Nahshon son of Amminadab, leader of the tribe of Judah, presented his offering.
NUM.7.13	His offering consisted of a silver platter weighing 3
NUM.7.14	He also brought a gold container weighing four ounces,
NUM.7.15	He brought a young bull, a ram, and a one-year-old male lamb for a burnt offering, 
NUM.7.16	and a male goat for a sin offering. 
NUM.7.17	For a peace offering he brought two bulls, five rams, five male goats, and five one-year-old male lambs. This was the offering brought by Nahshon son of Amminadab.

NUM.7.88	Twenty-four bulls, sixty rams, sixty male goats, and sixty one-year-old male lambs were donated for the peace offerings. This was the dedication offering for the altar after it was anointed.
NUM.7.89	Whenever Moses went into the Tabernacle to speak with the 
NUM.8.1	The 
NUM.8.2	“Give Aaron the following instructions: When you set up the seven lamps in the lampstand, place them so their light shines forward in front of the lampstand.” 
NUM.8.3	So Aaron did this. He set up the seven lamps so they reflected their light forward, just as the 
NUM.8.4	The entire lampstand, from its base to its decorative blossoms, was made of beaten gold. It was built according to the exact design the 
NUM.8.5	Then the 
NUM.8.6	“Now set the Levites apart from the rest of the people of Israel and make them ceremonially clean. 
NUM.8.7	Do this by sprinkling them with the water of purification, and have them shave their entire body and wash their clothing. Then they will be ceremonially clean. 
NUM.8.8	Have them bring a young bull and a grain offering of choice flour moistened with olive oil, along with a second young bull for a sin offering. 
NUM.8.9	Then assemble the whole community of Israel, and present the Levites at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
NUM.8.10	When you present the Levites before the 
NUM.8.11	Raising his hands, Aaron must then present the Levites to the 
NUM.8.12	“Next the Levites will lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls. Present one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the 
NUM.8.13	Then have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons, and raise your hands and present them as a special offering to the 
NUM.8.14	In this way, you will set the Levites apart from the rest of the people of Israel, and the Levites will belong to me. 
NUM.8.15	After this, they may go into the Tabernacle to do their work, because you have purified them and presented them as a special offering.
NUM.8.16	“Of all the people of Israel, the Levites are reserved for me. I have claimed them for myself in place of all the firstborn sons of the Israelites; I have taken the Levites as their substitutes. 
NUM.8.17	For all the firstborn males among the people of Israel are mine, both of people and of animals. I set them apart for myself on the day I struck down all the firstborn sons of the Egyptians. 
NUM.8.18	Yes, I have claimed the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons of Israel. 
NUM.8.19	And of all the Israelites, I have assigned the Levites to Aaron and his sons. They will serve in the Tabernacle on behalf of the Israelites and make sacrifices to purify
NUM.8.20	So Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of Israel dedicated the Levites, carefully following all the 
NUM.8.21	The Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes, and Aaron lifted them up and presented them to the 
NUM.8.22	After that the Levites went into the Tabernacle to perform their duties, assisting Aaron and his sons. So they carried out all the commands that the 
NUM.8.23	The 
NUM.8.24	“This is the rule the Levites must follow: They must begin serving in the Tabernacle at the age of twenty-five, 
NUM.8.25	and they must retire at the age of fifty. 
NUM.8.26	After retirement they may assist their fellow Levites by serving as guards at the Tabernacle, but they may not officiate in the service. This is how you must assign duties to the Levites.”
NUM.9.1	A year after Israel’s departure from Egypt, the 
NUM.9.2	“Tell the Israelites to celebrate the Passover at the prescribed time, 
NUM.9.3	at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month.
NUM.9.4	So Moses told the people to celebrate the Passover 
NUM.9.5	in the wilderness of Sinai as twilight fell on the fourteenth day of the month. And they celebrated the festival there, just as the 
NUM.9.6	But some of the men had been ceremonially defiled by touching a dead body, so they could not celebrate the Passover that day. They came to Moses and Aaron that day 
NUM.9.7	and said, “We have become ceremonially unclean by touching a dead body. But why should we be prevented from presenting the 
NUM.9.8	Moses answered, “Wait here until I have received instructions for you from the 
NUM.9.9	This was the 
NUM.9.10	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel: If any of the people now or in future generations are ceremonially unclean at Passover time because of touching a dead body, or if they are on a journey and cannot be present at the ceremony, they may still celebrate the 
NUM.9.11	They must offer the Passover sacrifice one month later, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the second month.
NUM.9.12	They must not leave any of the lamb until the next morning, and they must not break any of its bones. They must follow all the normal regulations concerning the Passover.
NUM.9.13	“But those who neglect to celebrate the Passover at the regular time, even though they are ceremonially clean and not away on a trip, will be cut off from the community of Israel. If they fail to present the 
NUM.9.14	And if foreigners living among you want to celebrate the Passover to the 
NUM.9.15	On the day the Tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered it.
NUM.9.16	This was the regular pattern—at night the cloud that covered the Tabernacle had the appearance of fire. 
NUM.9.17	Whenever the cloud lifted from over the sacred tent, the people of Israel would break camp and follow it. And wherever the cloud settled, the people of Israel would set up camp. 
NUM.9.18	In this way, they traveled and camped at the 
NUM.9.19	If the cloud remained over the Tabernacle for a long time, the Israelites stayed and performed their duty to the 
NUM.9.20	Sometimes the cloud would stay over the Tabernacle for only a few days, so the people would stay for only a few days, as the 
NUM.9.21	Sometimes the cloud stayed only overnight and lifted the next morning. But day or night, when the cloud lifted, the people broke camp and moved on. 
NUM.9.22	Whether the cloud stayed above the Tabernacle for two days, a month, or a year, the people of Israel stayed in camp and did not move on. But as soon as it lifted, they broke camp and moved on. 
NUM.9.23	So they camped or traveled at the 
NUM.10.1	Now the 
NUM.10.2	“Make two trumpets of hammered silver for calling the community to assemble and for signaling the breaking of camp. 
NUM.10.3	When both trumpets are blown, everyone must gather before you at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
NUM.10.4	But if only one trumpet is blown, then only the leaders—the heads of the clans of Israel—must present themselves to you.
NUM.10.5	“When you sound the signal to move on, the tribes camped on the east side of the Tabernacle must break camp and move forward. 
NUM.10.6	When you sound the signal a second time, the tribes camped on the south will follow. You must sound short blasts as the signal for moving on. 
NUM.10.7	But when you call the people to an assembly, blow the trumpets with a different signal. 
NUM.10.8	Only the priests, Aaron’s descendants, are allowed to blow the trumpets. This is a permanent law for you, to be observed from generation to generation.
NUM.10.9	“When you arrive in your own land and go to war against your enemies who attack you, sound the alarm with the trumpets. Then the 
NUM.10.10	Blow the trumpets in times of gladness, too, sounding them at your annual festivals and at the beginning of each month. And blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and peace offerings. The trumpets will remind your God of his covenant with you. I am the 
NUM.10.11	In the second year after Israel’s departure from Egypt—on the twentieth day of the second month
NUM.10.12	So the Israelites set out from the wilderness of Sinai and traveled on from place to place until the cloud stopped in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM.10.13	When the people set out for the first time, following the instructions the 
NUM.10.14	Judah’s troops led the way. They marched behind their banner, and their leader was Nahshon son of Amminadab. 
NUM.10.15	They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Issachar, led by Nethanel son of Zuar, 
NUM.10.16	and the troops of the tribe of Zebulun, led by Eliab son of Helon.
NUM.10.17	Then the Tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonite and Merarite divisions of the Levites were next in the line of march, carrying the Tabernacle with them. 
NUM.10.18	Reuben’s troops went next, marching behind their banner. Their leader was Elizur son of Shedeur. 
NUM.10.19	They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Simeon, led by Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai, 
NUM.10.20	and the troops of the tribe of Gad, led by Eliasaph son of Deuel.
NUM.10.21	Next came the Kohathite division of the Levites, carrying the sacred objects from the Tabernacle. Before they arrived at the next camp, the Tabernacle would already be set up at its new location. 
NUM.10.22	Ephraim’s troops went next, marching behind their banner. Their leader was Elishama son of Ammihud. 
NUM.10.23	They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Manasseh, led by Gamaliel son of Pedahzur, 
NUM.10.24	and the troops of the tribe of Benjamin, led by Abidan son of Gideoni.
NUM.10.25	Dan’s troops went last, marching behind their banner and serving as the rear guard for all the tribal camps. Their leader was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. 
NUM.10.26	They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Asher, led by Pagiel son of Ocran, 
NUM.10.27	and the troops of the tribe of Naphtali, led by Ahira son of Enan.
NUM.10.28	This was the order in which the Israelites marched, division by division.
NUM.10.29	One day Moses said to his brother-in-law, Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, “We are on our way to the place the 
NUM.10.30	But Hobab replied, “No, I will not go. I must return to my own land and family.”
NUM.10.31	“Please don’t leave us,” Moses pleaded. “You know the places in the wilderness where we should camp. Come, be our guide. 
NUM.10.32	If you do, we’ll share with you all the blessings the 
NUM.10.33	They marched for three days after leaving the mountain of the 
NUM.10.34	As they moved on each day, the cloud of the 
NUM.10.35	And whenever the Ark set out, Moses would shout, “Arise, O 
NUM.10.36	And when the Ark was set down, he would say, “Return, O 
NUM.11.1	Soon the people began to complain about their hardship, and the 
NUM.11.2	Then the people screamed to Moses for help, and when he prayed to the 
NUM.11.3	After that, the area was known as Taberah (which means “the place of burning”), because fire from the 
NUM.11.4	Then the foreign rabble who were traveling with the Israelites began to crave the good things of Egypt. And the people of Israel also began to complain. “Oh, for some meat!” they exclaimed. 
NUM.11.5	“We remember the fish we used to eat for free in Egypt. And we had all the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic we wanted. 
NUM.11.6	But now our appetites are gone. All we ever see is this manna!”
NUM.11.7	The manna looked like small coriander seeds, and it was pale yellow like gum resin. 
NUM.11.8	The people would go out and gather it from the ground. They made flour by grinding it with hand mills or pounding it in mortars. Then they boiled it in a pot and made it into flat cakes. These cakes tasted like pastries baked with olive oil. 
NUM.11.9	The manna came down on the camp with the dew during the night.
NUM.11.10	Moses heard all the families standing in the doorways of their tents whining, and the 
NUM.11.11	And Moses said to the 
NUM.11.12	Did I give birth to them? Did I bring them into the world? Why did you tell me to carry them in my arms like a mother carries a nursing baby? How can I carry them to the land you swore to give their ancestors? 
NUM.11.13	Where am I supposed to get meat for all these people? They keep whining to me, saying, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ 
NUM.11.14	I can’t carry all these people by myself! The load is far too heavy! 
NUM.11.15	If this is how you intend to treat me, just go ahead and kill me. Do me a favor and spare me this misery!”
NUM.11.16	Then the 
NUM.11.17	I will come down and talk to you there. I will take some of the Spirit that is upon you, and I will put the Spirit upon them also. They will bear the burden of the people along with you, so you will not have to carry it alone.
NUM.11.18	“And say to the people, ‘Purify yourselves, for tomorrow you will have meat to eat. You were whining, and the 
NUM.11.19	And it won’t be for just a day or two, or for five or ten or even twenty. 
NUM.11.20	You will eat it for a whole month until you gag and are sick of it. For you have rejected the 
NUM.11.21	But Moses responded to the 
NUM.11.22	Even if we butchered all our flocks and herds, would that satisfy them? Even if we caught all the fish in the sea, would that be enough?”
NUM.11.23	Then the 
NUM.11.24	So Moses went out and reported the 
NUM.11.25	And the 
NUM.11.26	Two men, Eldad and Medad, had stayed behind in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but they had not gone out to the Tabernacle. Yet the Spirit rested upon them as well, so they prophesied there in the camp. 
NUM.11.27	A young man ran and reported to Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”
NUM.11.28	Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ assistant since his youth, protested, “Moses, my master, make them stop!”
NUM.11.29	But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the 
NUM.11.30	Then Moses returned to the camp with the elders of Israel.
NUM.11.31	Now the 
NUM.11.32	So the people went out and caught quail all that day and throughout the night and all the next day, too. No one gathered less than fifty bushels
NUM.11.33	But while they were gorging themselves on the meat—while it was still in their mouths—the anger of the 
NUM.11.34	So that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah (which means “graves of gluttony”) because there they buried the people who had craved meat from Egypt. 
NUM.11.35	From Kibroth-hattaavah the Israelites traveled to Hazeroth, where they stayed for some time.
NUM.12.1	While they were at Hazeroth, Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because he had married a Cushite woman. 
NUM.12.2	They said, “Has the 
NUM.12.3	(Now Moses was very humble—more humble than any other person on earth.)
NUM.12.4	So immediately the 
NUM.12.5	Then the 
NUM.12.6	And the 
NUM.12.6	“If there were prophets among you,
NUM.12.6	I, the 
NUM.12.6	I would speak to them in dreams.
NUM.12.7	But not with my servant Moses.
NUM.12.7	Of all my house, he is the one I trust.
NUM.12.8	I speak to him face to face,
NUM.12.8	clearly, and not in riddles!
NUM.12.8	He sees the 
NUM.12.8	So why were you not afraid
NUM.12.8	to criticize my servant Moses?”
NUM.12.9	The 
NUM.12.10	As the cloud moved from above the Tabernacle, there stood Miriam, her skin as white as snow from leprosy.
NUM.12.11	he cried out to Moses, “Oh, my master! Please don’t punish us for this sin we have so foolishly committed. 
NUM.12.12	Don’t let her be like a stillborn baby, already decayed at birth.”
NUM.12.13	So Moses cried out to the 
NUM.12.14	But the 
NUM.12.15	So Miriam was kept outside the camp for seven days, and the people waited until she was brought back before they traveled again. 
NUM.12.16	Then they left Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM.13.1	The 
NUM.13.2	“Send out men to explore the land of Canaan, the land I am giving to the Israelites. Send one leader from each of the twelve ancestral tribes.” 
NUM.13.3	So Moses did as the 
NUM.13.4	These were the tribes and the names of their leaders:
NUM.13.4	Reuben
NUM.13.4	Shammua son of Zaccur
NUM.13.5	Simeon
NUM.13.5	Shaphat son of Hori
NUM.13.6	Judah
NUM.13.6	Caleb son of Jephunneh
NUM.13.7	Issachar
NUM.13.7	Igal son of Joseph
NUM.13.8	Ephraim
NUM.13.8	Hoshea son of Nun
NUM.13.9	Benjamin
NUM.13.9	Palti son of Raphu
NUM.13.10	Zebulun
NUM.13.10	Gaddiel son of Sodi
NUM.13.11	Manasseh son of Joseph
NUM.13.11	Gaddi son of Susi
NUM.13.12	Dan
NUM.13.12	Ammiel son of Gemalli
NUM.13.13	Asher
NUM.13.13	Sethur son of Michael
NUM.13.14	Naphtali
NUM.13.14	Nahbi son of Vophsi
NUM.13.15	Gad
NUM.13.15	Geuel son of Maki
NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men Moses sent out to explore the land. (Moses called Hoshea son of Nun by the name Joshua.)
NUM.13.17	Moses gave the men these instructions as he sent them out to explore the land: “Go north through the Negev into the hill country. 
NUM.13.18	See what the land is like, and find out whether the people living there are strong or weak, few or many. 
NUM.13.19	See what kind of land they live in. Is it good or bad? Do their towns have walls, or are they unprotected like open camps? 
NUM.13.20	Is the soil fertile or poor? Are there many trees? Do your best to bring back samples of the crops you see.” (It happened to be the season for harvesting the first ripe grapes.)
NUM.13.21	So they went up and explored the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, near Lebo-hamath. 
NUM.13.22	Going north, they passed through the Negev and arrived at Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai—all descendants of Anak—lived. (The ancient town of Hebron was founded seven years before the Egyptian city of Zoan.) 
NUM.13.23	When they came to the valley of Eshcol, they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes so large that it took two of them to carry it on a pole between them! They also brought back samples of the pomegranates and figs. 
NUM.13.24	That place was called the valley of Eshcol (which means “cluster”), because of the cluster of grapes the Israelite men cut there.
NUM.13.25	After exploring the land for forty days, the men returned 
NUM.13.26	to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of Israel at Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran. They reported to the whole community what they had seen and showed them the fruit they had taken from the land. 
NUM.13.27	This was their report to Moses: “We entered the land you sent us to explore, and it is indeed a bountiful country—a land flowing with milk and honey. Here is the kind of fruit it produces. 
NUM.13.28	But the people living there are powerful, and their towns are large and fortified. We even saw giants there, the descendants of Anak! 
NUM.13.29	The Amalekites live in the Negev, and the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country. The Canaanites live along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea
NUM.13.30	But Caleb tried to quiet the people as they stood before Moses. “Let’s go at once to take the land,” he said. “We can certainly conquer it!”
NUM.13.31	But the other men who had explored the land with him disagreed. “We can’t go up against them! They are stronger than we are!” 
NUM.13.32	So they spread this bad report about the land among the Israelites: “The land we traveled through and explored will devour anyone who goes to live there. All the people we saw were huge. 
NUM.13.33	We even saw giants
NUM.14.1	Then the whole community began weeping aloud, and they cried all night. 
NUM.14.2	Their voices rose in a great chorus of protest against Moses and Aaron. “If only we had died in Egypt, or even here in the wilderness!” they complained. 
NUM.14.3	“Why is the 
NUM.14.4	Then they plotted among themselves, “Let’s choose a new leader and go back to Egypt!”
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground before the whole community of Israel. 
NUM.14.6	Two of the men who had explored the land, Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, tore their clothing. 
NUM.14.7	They said to all the people of Israel, “The land we traveled through and explored is a wonderful land! 
NUM.14.8	And if the 
NUM.14.9	Do not rebel against the 
NUM.14.10	But the whole community began to talk about stoning Joshua and Caleb. Then the glorious presence of the 
NUM.14.11	And the 
NUM.14.12	I will disown them and destroy them with a plague. Then I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are!”
NUM.14.13	But Moses objected. “What will the Egyptians think when they hear about it?” he asked the 
NUM.14.14	Now if you destroy them, the Egyptians will send a report to the inhabitants of this land, who have already heard that you live among your people. They know, 
NUM.14.15	Now if you slaughter all these people with a single blow, the nations that have heard of your fame will say, 
NUM.14.16	‘The 
NUM.14.17	“Please, Lord, prove that your power is as great as you have claimed. For you said, 
NUM.14.18	‘The 
NUM.14.19	In keeping with your magnificent, unfailing love, please pardon the sins of this people, just as you have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.”
NUM.14.20	Then the 
NUM.14.21	But as surely as I live, and as surely as the earth is filled with the 
NUM.14.22	not one of these people will ever enter that land. They have all seen my glorious presence and the miraculous signs I performed both in Egypt and in the wilderness, but again and again they have tested me by refusing to listen to my voice. 
NUM.14.23	They will never even see the land I swore to give their ancestors. None of those who have treated me with contempt will ever see it. 
NUM.14.24	But my servant Caleb has a different attitude than the others have. He has remained loyal to me, so I will bring him into the land he explored. His descendants will possess their full share of that land. 
NUM.14.25	Now turn around, and don’t go on toward the land where the Amalekites and Canaanites live. Tomorrow you must set out for the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.
NUM.14.26	Then the 
NUM.14.27	“How long must I put up with this wicked community and its complaints about me? Yes, I have heard the complaints the Israelites are making against me. 
NUM.14.28	Now tell them this: ‘As surely as I live, declares the 
NUM.14.29	You will all drop dead in this wilderness! Because you complained against me, every one of you who is twenty years old or older and was included in the registration will die. 
NUM.14.30	You will not enter and occupy the land I swore to give you. The only exceptions will be Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
NUM.14.31	“‘You said your children would be carried off as plunder. Well, I will bring them safely into the land, and they will enjoy what you have despised. 
NUM.14.32	But as for you, you will drop dead in this wilderness. 
NUM.14.33	And your children will be like shepherds, wandering in the wilderness for forty years. In this way, they will pay for your faithlessness, until the last of you lies dead in the wilderness.
NUM.14.34	“‘Because your men explored the land for forty days, you must wander in the wilderness for forty years—a year for each day, suffering the consequences of your sins. Then you will discover what it is like to have me for an enemy.’ 
NUM.14.35	I, the 
NUM.14.36	The ten men Moses had sent to explore the land—the ones who incited rebellion against the 
NUM.14.37	were struck dead with a plague before the 
NUM.14.38	Of the twelve who had explored the land, only Joshua and Caleb remained alive.
NUM.14.39	When Moses reported the 
NUM.14.40	Then they got up early the next morning and went to the top of the range of hills. “Let’s go,” they said. “We realize that we have sinned, but now we are ready to enter the land the 
NUM.14.41	But Moses said, “Why are you now disobeying the 
NUM.14.42	Do not go up into the land now. You will only be crushed by your enemies because the 
NUM.14.43	When you face the Amalekites and Canaanites in battle, you will be slaughtered. The 
NUM.14.44	But the people defiantly pushed ahead toward the hill country, even though neither Moses nor the Ark of the 
NUM.14.45	Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in those hills came down and attacked them and chased them back as far as Hormah.
NUM.15.1	Then the 
NUM.15.2	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.
NUM.15.2	“When you finally settle in the land I am giving you, 
NUM.15.3	you will offer special gifts as a pleasing aroma to the 
NUM.15.4	When you present these offerings, you must also give the 
NUM.15.5	For each lamb offered as a burnt offering or a special sacrifice, you must also present one quart of wine as a liquid offering.
NUM.15.6	“If the sacrifice is a ram, give a grain offering of four quarts
NUM.15.7	and give a third of a gallon of wine as a liquid offering. This will be a pleasing aroma to the 
NUM.15.8	“When you present a young bull as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow or as a peace offering to the 
NUM.15.9	you must also give a grain offering of six quarts
NUM.15.10	and give two quarts of wine as a liquid offering. This will be a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the 
NUM.15.11	“Each sacrifice of a bull, ram, lamb, or young goat should be prepared in this way. 
NUM.15.12	Follow these instructions with each offering you present. 
NUM.15.13	All of you native-born Israelites must follow these instructions when you offer a special gift as a pleasing aroma to the 
NUM.15.14	And if any foreigners visit you or live among you and want to present a special gift as a pleasing aroma to the 
NUM.15.15	Native-born Israelites and foreigners are equal before the 
NUM.15.16	The same instructions and regulations will apply both to you and to the foreigners living among you.”
NUM.15.17	Then the 
NUM.15.18	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.
NUM.15.18	“When you arrive in the land where I am taking you, 
NUM.15.19	and you eat the crops that grow there, you must set some aside as a sacred offering to the 
NUM.15.20	Present a cake from the first of the flour you grind, and set it aside as a sacred offering, as you do with the first grain from the threshing floor. 
NUM.15.21	Throughout the generations to come, you are to present a sacred offering to the 
NUM.15.22	“But suppose you unintentionally fail to carry out all these commands that the 
NUM.15.23	And suppose your descendants in the future fail to do everything the 
NUM.15.24	If the mistake was made unintentionally, and the community was unaware of it, the whole community must present a young bull for a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the 
NUM.15.25	With it the priest will purify the whole community of Israel, making them right with the 
NUM.15.26	The whole community of Israel will be forgiven, including the foreigners living among you, for all the people were involved in the sin.
NUM.15.27	“If one individual commits an unintentional sin, the guilty person must bring a one-year-old female goat for a sin offering. 
NUM.15.28	The priest will sacrifice it to purify
NUM.15.29	These same instructions apply both to native-born Israelites and to the foreigners living among you.
NUM.15.30	“But those who brazenly violate the 
NUM.15.31	Since they have treated the 
NUM.15.32	One day while the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they discovered a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day. 
NUM.15.33	The people who found him doing this took him before Moses, Aaron, and the rest of the community. 
NUM.15.34	They held him in custody because they did not know what to do with him. 
NUM.15.35	Then the 
NUM.15.36	So the whole community took the man outside the camp and stoned him to death, just as the 
NUM.15.37	Then the 
NUM.15.38	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel: Throughout the generations to come you must make tassels for the hems of your clothing and attach them with a blue cord. 
NUM.15.39	When you see the tassels, you will remember and obey all the commands of the

NUM.16.1	One day Korah son of Izhar, a descendant of Kohath son of Levi, conspired with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, from the tribe of Reuben. 
NUM.16.2	They incited a rebellion against Moses, along with 250 other leaders of the community, all prominent members of the assembly. 
NUM.16.3	They united against Moses and Aaron and said, “You have gone too far! The whole community of Israel has been set apart by the 
NUM.16.4	When Moses heard what they were saying, he fell face down on the ground. 
NUM.16.5	Then he said to Korah and his followers, “Tomorrow morning the 
NUM.16.6	Korah, you and all your followers must prepare your incense burners. 
NUM.16.7	Light fires in them tomorrow, and burn incense before the 
NUM.16.8	Then Moses spoke again to Korah: “Now listen, you Levites! 
NUM.16.9	Does it seem insignificant to you that the God of Israel has chosen you from among all the community of Israel to be near him so you can serve in the 
NUM.16.10	Korah, he has already given this special ministry to you and your fellow Levites. Are you now demanding the priesthood as well? 
NUM.16.11	The 
NUM.16.12	Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they replied, “We refuse to come before you! 
NUM.16.13	Isn’t it enough that you brought us out of Egypt, a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us here in this wilderness, and that you now treat us like your subjects? 
NUM.16.14	What’s more, you haven’t brought us into another land flowing with milk and honey. You haven’t given us a new homeland with fields and vineyards. Are you trying to fool these men?
NUM.16.15	Then Moses became very angry and said to the 
NUM.16.16	And Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers must come here tomorrow and present yourselves before the 
NUM.16.17	You and each of your 250 followers must prepare an incense burner and put incense on it, so you can all present them before the 
NUM.16.18	So each of these men prepared an incense burner, lit the fire, and placed incense on it. Then they all stood at the entrance of the Tabernacle
NUM.16.19	Meanwhile, Korah had stirred up the entire community against Moses and Aaron, and they all gathered at the Tabernacle entrance. Then the glorious presence of the 
NUM.16.20	and the 
NUM.16.21	“Get away from all these people so that I may instantly destroy them!”
NUM.16.22	But Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground. “O God,” they pleaded, “you are the God who gives breath to all creatures. Must you be angry with all the people when only one man sins?”
NUM.16.23	And the 
NUM.16.24	“Then tell all the people to get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”
NUM.16.25	So Moses got up and rushed over to the tents of Dathan and Abiram, followed by the elders of Israel. 
NUM.16.26	“Quick!” he told the people. “Get away from the tents of these wicked men, and don’t touch anything that belongs to them. If you do, you will be destroyed for their sins.” 
NUM.16.27	So all the people stood back from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Then Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrances of their tents, together with their wives and children and little ones.
NUM.16.28	And Moses said, “This is how you will know that the 
NUM.16.29	If these men die a natural death, or if nothing unusual happens, then the 
NUM.16.30	But if the 
NUM.16.31	He had hardly finished speaking the words when the ground suddenly split open beneath them. 
NUM.16.32	The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the men, along with their households and all their followers who were standing with them, and everything they owned. 
NUM.16.33	So they went down alive into the grave, along with all their belongings. The earth closed over them, and they all vanished from among the people of Israel. 
NUM.16.34	All the people around them fled when they heard their screams. “The earth will swallow us, too!” they cried. 
NUM.16.35	Then fire blazed forth from the 
NUM.16.36	And the 
NUM.16.37	“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to pull all the incense burners from the fire, for they are holy. Also tell him to scatter the burning coals. 
NUM.16.38	Take the incense burners of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, and hammer the metal into a thin sheet to overlay the altar. Since these burners were used in the 
NUM.16.39	So Eleazar the priest collected the 250 bronze incense burners that had been used by the men who died in the fire, and the bronze was hammered into a thin sheet to overlay the altar. 
NUM.16.40	This would warn the Israelites that no unauthorized person—no one who was not a descendant of Aaron—should ever enter the 
NUM.16.41	But the very next morning the whole community of Israel began muttering again against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the 
NUM.16.42	As the community gathered to protest against Moses and Aaron, they turned toward the Tabernacle and saw that the cloud had covered it, and the glorious presence of the 
NUM.16.43	Moses and Aaron came and stood in front of the Tabernacle, 
NUM.16.44	and the 
NUM.16.45	“Get away from all these people so that I can instantly destroy them!” But Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground.
NUM.16.46	And Moses said to Aaron, “Quick, take an incense burner and place burning coals on it from the altar. Lay incense on it, and carry it out among the people to purify them and make them right with the 
NUM.16.47	Aaron did as Moses told him and ran out among the people. The plague had already begun to strike down the people, but Aaron burned the incense and purified
NUM.16.48	He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague stopped. 
NUM.16.49	But 14,700 people died in that plague, in addition to those who had died in the affair involving Korah. 
NUM.16.50	Then because the plague had stopped, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
NUM.17.1	Then the 
NUM.17.2	“Tell the people of Israel to bring you twelve wooden staffs, one from each leader of Israel’s ancestral tribes, and inscribe each leader’s name on his staff. 
NUM.17.3	Inscribe Aaron’s name on the staff of the tribe of Levi, for there must be one staff for the leader of each ancestral tribe. 
NUM.17.4	Place these staffs in the Tabernacle in front of the Ark containing the tablets of the Covenant,
NUM.17.5	Buds will sprout on the staff belonging to the man I choose. Then I will finally put an end to the people’s murmuring and complaining against you.”
NUM.17.6	So Moses gave the instructions to the people of Israel, and each of the twelve tribal leaders, including Aaron, brought Moses a staff. 
NUM.17.7	Moses placed the staffs in the 
NUM.17.8	When he went into the Tabernacle of the Covenant the next day, he found that Aaron’s staff, representing the tribe of Levi, had sprouted, budded, blossomed, and produced ripe almonds!
NUM.17.9	When Moses brought all the staffs out from the 
NUM.17.10	And the 
NUM.17.11	So Moses did as the 
NUM.17.12	Then the people of Israel said to Moses, “Look, we are doomed! We are dead! We are ruined! 
NUM.17.13	Everyone who even comes close to the Tabernacle of the 
NUM.18.1	Then the 
NUM.18.2	“Bring your relatives of the tribe of Levi—your ancestral tribe—to assist you and your sons as you perform the sacred duties in front of the Tabernacle of the Covenant.
NUM.18.3	But as the Levites go about all their assigned duties at the Tabernacle, they must be careful not to go near any of the sacred objects or the altar. If they do, both you and they will die. 
NUM.18.4	The Levites must join you in fulfilling their responsibilities for the care and maintenance of the Tabernacle,
NUM.18.5	“You yourselves must perform the sacred duties inside the sanctuary and at the altar. If you follow these instructions, the 
NUM.18.6	I myself have chosen your fellow Levites from among the Israelites to be your special assistants. They are a gift to you, dedicated to the 
NUM.18.7	But you and your sons, the priests, must personally handle all the priestly rituals associated with the altar and with everything behind the inner curtain. I am giving you the priesthood as your special privilege of service. Any unauthorized person who comes too near the sanctuary will be put to death.”
NUM.18.8	The 
NUM.18.9	You are allotted the portion of the most holy offerings that is not burned on the fire. This portion of all the most holy offerings—including the grain offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings—will be most holy, and it belongs to you and your sons. 
NUM.18.10	You must eat it as a most holy offering. All the males may eat of it, and you must treat it as most holy.
NUM.18.11	“All the sacred offerings and special offerings presented to me when the Israelites lift them up before the altar also belong to you. I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters as your permanent share. Any member of your family who is ceremonially clean may eat of these offerings.
NUM.18.12	“I also give you the harvest gifts brought by the people as offerings to the 
NUM.18.13	All the first crops of their land that the people present to the 
NUM.18.14	“Everything in Israel that is specially set apart for the 
NUM.18.15	“The firstborn of every mother, whether human or animal, that is offered to the 
NUM.18.16	Redeem them when they are one month old. The redemption price is five pieces of silver
NUM.18.17	“However, you may not redeem the firstborn of cattle, sheep, or goats. They are holy and have been set apart for the 
NUM.18.18	The meat of these animals will be yours, just like the breast and right thigh that are presented by lifting them up as a special offering before the altar. 
NUM.18.19	Yes, I am giving you all these holy offerings that the people of Israel bring to the 
NUM.18.20	And the 
NUM.18.21	As for the tribe of Levi, your relatives, I will compensate them for their service in the Tabernacle. Instead of an allotment of land, I will give them the tithes from the entire land of Israel.
NUM.18.22	“From now on, no Israelites except priests or Levites may approach the Tabernacle. If they come too near, they will be judged guilty and will die. 
NUM.18.23	Only the Levites may serve at the Tabernacle, and they will be held responsible for any offenses against it. This is a permanent law for you, to be observed from generation to generation. The Levites will receive no allotment of land among the Israelites, 
NUM.18.24	because I have given them the Israelites’ tithes, which have been presented as sacred offerings to the 
NUM.18.25	The 
NUM.18.26	“Give these instructions to the Levites: When you receive from the people of Israel the tithes I have assigned as your allotment, give a tenth of the tithes you receive—a tithe of the tithe—to the 
NUM.18.27	The 
NUM.18.28	You must present one-tenth of the tithe received from the Israelites as a sacred offering to the 
NUM.18.29	Be sure to give to the 
NUM.18.30	“Also, give these instructions to the Levites: When you present the best part as your offering, it will be considered as though it came from your own threshing floor or winepress. 
NUM.18.31	You Levites and your families may eat this food anywhere you wish, for it is your compensation for serving in the Tabernacle. 
NUM.18.32	You will not be considered guilty for accepting the 
NUM.19.1	The 
NUM.19.2	“Here is another legal requirement commanded by the 
NUM.19.3	Give it to Eleazar the priest, and it will be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence. 
NUM.19.4	Eleazar will take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Tabernacle.
NUM.19.5	As Eleazar watches, the heifer must be burned—its hide, meat, blood, and dung. 
NUM.19.6	Eleazar the priest must then take a stick of cedar,
NUM.19.7	“Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself in water. Afterward he may return to the camp, though he will remain ceremonially unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.8	The man who burns the animal must also wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and he, too, will remain unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.9	Then someone who is ceremonially clean will gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them in a purified place outside the camp. They will be kept there for the community of Israel to use in the water for the purification ceremony. This ceremony is performed for the removal of sin. 
NUM.19.10	The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he will remain ceremonially unclean until evening. This is a permanent law for the people of Israel and any foreigners who live among them.
NUM.19.11	“All those who touch a dead human body will be ceremonially unclean for seven days. 
NUM.19.12	They must purify themselves on the third and seventh days with the water of purification; then they will be purified. But if they do not do this on the third and seventh days, they will continue to be unclean even after the seventh day. 
NUM.19.13	All those who touch a dead body and do not purify themselves in the proper way defile the 
NUM.19.14	“This is the ritual law that applies when someone dies inside a tent: All those who enter that tent and those who were inside when the death occurred will be ceremonially unclean for seven days. 
NUM.19.15	Any open container in the tent that was not covered with a lid is also defiled. 
NUM.19.16	And if someone in an open field touches the corpse of someone who was killed with a sword or who died a natural death, or if someone touches a human bone or a grave, that person will be defiled for seven days.
NUM.19.17	“To remove the defilement, put some of the ashes from the burnt purification offering in a jar, and pour fresh water over them. 
NUM.19.18	Then someone who is ceremonially clean must take a hyssop branch and dip it into the water. That person must sprinkle the water on the tent, on all the furnishings in the tent, and on the people who were in the tent; also on the person who touched a human bone, or touched someone who was killed or who died naturally, or touched a grave. 
NUM.19.19	On the third and seventh days the person who is ceremonially clean must sprinkle the water on those who are defiled. Then on the seventh day the people being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe themselves, and that evening they will be cleansed of their defilement.
NUM.19.20	“But those who become defiled and do not purify themselves will be cut off from the community, for they have defiled the sanctuary of the 
NUM.19.21	This is a permanent law for the people. Those who sprinkle the water of purification must afterward wash their clothes, and anyone who then touches the water used for purification will remain defiled until evening. 
NUM.19.22	Anything and anyone that a defiled person touches will be ceremonially unclean until evening.”
NUM.20.1	In the first month of the year,
NUM.20.2	There was no water for the people to drink at that place, so they rebelled against Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.20.3	The people blamed Moses and said, “If only we had died in the 
NUM.20.4	Why have you brought the congregation of the 
NUM.20.5	Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us here to this terrible place? This land has no grain, no figs, no grapes, no pomegranates, and no water to drink!”
NUM.20.6	Moses and Aaron turned away from the people and went to the entrance of the Tabernacle,
NUM.20.7	and the 
NUM.20.8	“You and Aaron must take the staff and assemble the entire community. As the people watch, speak to the rock over there, and it will pour out its water. You will provide enough water from the rock to satisfy the whole community and their livestock.”
NUM.20.9	So Moses did as he was told. He took the staff from the place where it was kept before the 
NUM.20.10	Then he and Aaron summoned the people to come and gather at the rock. “Listen, you rebels!” he shouted. “Must we bring you water from this rock?” 
NUM.20.11	Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with the staff, and water gushed out. So the entire community and their livestock drank their fill.
NUM.20.12	But the 
NUM.20.13	This place was known as the waters of Meribah (which means “arguing”) because there the people of Israel argued with the 
NUM.20.14	While Moses was at Kadesh, he sent ambassadors to the king of Edom with this message:
NUM.20.14	“This is what your relatives, the people of Israel, say: You know all the hardships we have been through. 
NUM.20.15	Our ancestors went down to Egypt, and we lived there a long time, and we and our ancestors were brutally mistreated by the Egyptians. 
NUM.20.16	But when we cried out to the 
NUM.20.17	Please let us travel through your land. We will be careful not to go through your fields and vineyards. We won’t even drink water from your wells. We will stay on the king’s road and never leave it until we have passed through your territory.”
NUM.20.18	But the king of Edom said, “Stay out of my land, or I will meet you with an army!”
NUM.20.19	The Israelites answered, “We will stay on the main road. If our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. Just let us pass through your country. That’s all we ask.”
NUM.20.20	But the king of Edom replied, “Stay out! You may not pass through our land.” With that he mobilized his army and marched out against them with an imposing force. 
NUM.20.21	Because Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their country, Israel was forced to turn around.
NUM.20.22	The whole community of Israel left Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor. 
NUM.20.23	There, on the border of the land of Edom, the 
NUM.20.24	“The time has come for Aaron to join his ancestors in death. He will not enter the land I am giving the people of Israel, because the two of you rebelled against my instructions concerning the water at Meribah. 
NUM.20.25	Now take Aaron and his son Eleazar up Mount Hor. 
NUM.20.26	There you will remove Aaron’s priestly garments and put them on Eleazar, his son. Aaron will die there and join his ancestors.”
NUM.20.27	So Moses did as the 
NUM.20.28	At the summit, Moses removed the priestly garments from Aaron and put them on Eleazar, Aaron’s son. Then Aaron died there on top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar went back down. 
NUM.20.29	When the people realized that Aaron had died, all Israel mourned for him thirty days.
NUM.21.1	The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that the Israelites were approaching on the road through Atharim. So he attacked the Israelites and took some of them as prisoners. 
NUM.21.2	Then the people of Israel made this vow to the 
NUM.21.3	The 
NUM.21.4	Then the people of Israel set out from Mount Hor, taking the road to the Red Sea
NUM.21.5	and they began to speak against God and Moses. “Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die here in the wilderness?” they complained. “There is nothing to eat here and nothing to drink. And we hate this horrible manna!”
NUM.21.6	So the 
NUM.21.7	Then the people came to Moses and cried out, “We have sinned by speaking against the 
NUM.21.8	Then the 
NUM.21.9	So Moses made a snake out of bronze and attached it to a pole. Then anyone who was bitten by a snake could look at the bronze snake and be healed!
NUM.21.10	The Israelites traveled next to Oboth and camped there. 
NUM.21.11	Then they went on to Iye-abarim, in the wilderness on the eastern border of Moab. 
NUM.21.12	From there they traveled to the valley of Zered Brook and set up camp. 
NUM.21.13	Then they moved out and camped on the far side of the Arnon River, in the wilderness adjacent to the territory of the Amorites. The Arnon is the boundary line between the Moabites and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	For this reason 
NUM.21.15	and the ravines that extend as far as the settlement of Ar on the border of Moab.”
NUM.21.16	From there the Israelites traveled to Beer,
NUM.21.17	There the Israelites sang this song:
NUM.21.17	“Spring up, O well!
NUM.21.17	Yes, sing its praises!
NUM.21.18	Sing of this well,
NUM.21.18	which princes dug,
NUM.21.18	which great leaders hollowed out
NUM.21.18	with their scepters and staffs.”
NUM.21.18	Then the Israelites left the wilderness and proceeded on through Mattanah, 
NUM.21.19	Nahaliel, and Bamoth. 
NUM.21.20	After that they went to the valley in Moab where Pisgah Peak overlooks the wasteland.
NUM.21.21	The Israelites sent ambassadors to King Sihon of the Amorites with this message:
NUM.21.22	“Let us travel through your land. We will be careful not to go through your fields and vineyards. We won’t even drink water from your wells. We will stay on the king’s road until we have passed through your territory.”
NUM.21.23	But King Sihon refused to let them cross his territory. Instead, he mobilized his entire army and attacked Israel in the wilderness, engaging them in battle at Jahaz. 
NUM.21.24	But the Israelites slaughtered them with their swords and occupied their land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River. They went only as far as the Ammonite border because the boundary of the Ammonites was fortified.
NUM.21.25	So Israel captured all the towns of the Amorites and settled in them, including the city of Heshbon and its surrounding villages. 
NUM.21.26	Heshbon had been the capital of King Sihon of the Amorites. He had defeated a former Moabite king and seized all his land as far as the Arnon River. 
NUM.21.27	Therefore, the ancient poets wrote this about him:
NUM.21.27	“Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt!
NUM.21.27	Let the city of Sihon be restored.
NUM.21.28	A fire flamed forth from Heshbon,
NUM.21.28	a blaze from the city of Sihon.
NUM.21.28	It burned the city of Ar in Moab;
NUM.21.28	it destroyed the rulers of the Arnon heights.
NUM.21.29	What sorrow awaits you, O people of Moab!
NUM.21.29	You are finished, O worshipers of Chemosh!
NUM.21.29	Chemosh has left his sons as refugees,
NUM.21.29	his daughters as captives of Sihon, the Amorite king.
NUM.21.30	We have utterly destroyed them,
NUM.21.30	from Heshbon to Dibon.
NUM.21.30	We have completely wiped them out
NUM.21.30	as far away as Nophah and Medeba.
NUM.21.31	So the people of Israel occupied the territory of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.32	After Moses sent men to explore the Jazer area, they captured all the towns in the region and drove out the Amorites who lived there. 
NUM.21.33	Then they turned and marched up the road to Bashan, but King Og of Bashan and all his people attacked them at Edrei. 
NUM.21.34	The 
NUM.21.35	And Israel killed King Og, his sons, and all his subjects; not a single survivor remained. Then Israel occupied their land.
NUM.22.1	Then the people of Israel traveled to the plains of Moab and camped east of the Jordan River, across from Jericho. 
NUM.22.2	Balak son of Zippor, the Moabite king, had seen everything the Israelites did to the Amorites. 
NUM.22.3	And when the people of Moab saw how many Israelites there were, they were terrified. 
NUM.22.4	The king of Moab said to the elders of Midian, “This mob will devour everything in sight, like an ox devours grass in the field!”
NUM.22.4	So Balak, king of Moab, 
NUM.22.5	sent messengers to call Balaam son of Beor, who was living in his native land of Pethor
NUM.22.5	“Look, a vast horde of people has arrived from Egypt. They cover the face of the earth and are threatening me. 
NUM.22.6	Please come and curse these people for me because they are too powerful for me. Then perhaps I will be able to conquer them and drive them from the land. I know that blessings fall on any people you bless, and curses fall on people you curse.”
NUM.22.7	Balak’s messengers, who were elders of Moab and Midian, set out with money to pay Balaam to place a curse upon Israel.
NUM.22.8	“Stay here overnight,” Balaam said. “In the morning I will tell you whatever the 
NUM.22.9	That night God came to Balaam and asked him, “Who are these men visiting you?”
NUM.22.10	Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent me this message: 
NUM.22.11	‘Look, a vast horde of people has arrived from Egypt, and they cover the face of the earth. Come and curse these people for me. Then perhaps I will be able to stand up to them and drive them from the land.’”
NUM.22.12	But God told Balaam, “Do not go with them. You are not to curse these people, for they have been blessed!”
NUM.22.13	The next morning Balaam got up and told Balak’s officials, “Go on home! The 
NUM.22.14	So the Moabite officials returned to King Balak and reported, “Balaam refused to come with us.” 
NUM.22.15	Then Balak tried again. This time he sent a larger number of even more distinguished officials than those he had sent the first time. 
NUM.22.16	They went to Balaam and delivered this message to him:
NUM.22.16	“This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Please don’t let anything stop you from coming to help me. 
NUM.22.17	I will pay you very well and do whatever you tell me. Just come and curse these people for me!”
NUM.22.18	But Balaam responded to Balak’s messengers, “Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold, I would be powerless to do anything against the will of the 
NUM.22.19	But stay here one more night, and I will see if the 
NUM.22.20	That night God came to Balaam and told him, “Since these men have come for you, get up and go with them. But do only what I tell you to do.”
NUM.22.21	So the next morning Balaam got up, saddled his donkey, and started off with the Moabite officials. 
NUM.22.22	But God was angry that Balaam was going, so he sent the angel of the 
NUM.22.23	Balaam’s donkey saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.24	Then the angel of the 
NUM.22.25	When the donkey saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.26	Then the angel of the 
NUM.22.27	This time when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down under Balaam. In a fit of rage Balaam beat the animal again with his staff.
NUM.22.28	Then the 
NUM.22.29	“You have made me look like a fool!” Balaam shouted. “If I had a sword with me, I would kill you!”
NUM.22.30	“But I am the same donkey you have ridden all your life,” the donkey answered. “Have I ever done anything like this before?”
NUM.22.30	“No,” Balaam admitted.
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	“Why did you beat your donkey those three times?” the angel of the 
NUM.22.33	Three times the donkey saw me and shied away; otherwise, I would certainly have killed you by now and spared the donkey.”
NUM.22.34	Then Balaam confessed to the angel of the 
NUM.22.35	But the angel of the 
NUM.22.36	When King Balak heard that Balaam was on the way, he went out to meet him at a Moabite town on the Arnon River at the farthest border of his land.
NUM.22.37	“Didn’t I send you an urgent invitation? Why didn’t you come right away?” Balak asked Balaam. “Didn’t you believe me when I said I would reward you richly?”
NUM.22.38	Balaam replied, “Look, now I have come, but I have no power to say whatever I want. I will speak only the message that God puts in my mouth.” 
NUM.22.39	Then Balaam accompanied Balak to Kiriath-huzoth, 
NUM.22.40	where the king sacrificed cattle and sheep. He sent portions of the meat to Balaam and the officials who were with him. 
NUM.22.41	The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth-baal. From there he could see some of the people of Israel spread out below him.
NUM.23.1	Then Balaam said to King Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice.” 
NUM.23.2	Balak followed his instructions, and the two of them sacrificed a young bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.23.3	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offerings, and I will go to see if the 
NUM.23.4	and God met him there. Balaam said to him, “I have prepared seven altars and have sacrificed a young bull and a ram on each altar.”
NUM.23.5	The 
NUM.23.6	So Balaam returned and found the king standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab. 
NUM.23.7	This was the message Balaam delivered:
NUM.23.7	“Balak summoned me to come from Aram;
NUM.23.7	the king of Moab brought me from the eastern hills.
NUM.23.7	‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me!
NUM.23.7	Come and announce Israel’s doom.’
NUM.23.8	But how can I curse those
NUM.23.8	whom God has not cursed?
NUM.23.8	How can I condemn those
NUM.23.8	whom the 
NUM.23.9	I see them from the cliff tops;
NUM.23.9	I watch them from the hills.
NUM.23.9	I see a people who live by themselves,
NUM.23.9	set apart from other nations.
NUM.23.10	Who can count Jacob’s descendants, as numerous as dust?
NUM.23.10	Who can count even a fourth of Israel’s people?
NUM.23.10	Let me die like the righteous;
NUM.23.10	let my life end like theirs.”
NUM.23.11	Then King Balak demanded of Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies. Instead, you have blessed them!”
NUM.23.12	But Balaam replied, “I will speak only the message that the 
NUM.23.13	Then King Balak told him, “Come with me to another place. There you will see another part of the nation of Israel, but not all of them. Curse at least that many!” 
NUM.23.14	So Balak took Balaam to the plateau of Zophim on Pisgah Peak. He built seven altars there and offered a young bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.23.15	Then Balaam said to the king, “Stand here by your burnt offerings while I go over there to meet the 
NUM.23.16	And the 
NUM.23.17	So Balaam returned and found the king standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab. “What did the 
NUM.23.18	This was the message Balaam delivered:
NUM.23.18	“Rise up, Balak, and listen!
NUM.23.18	Hear me, son of Zippor.
NUM.23.19	God is not a man, so he does not lie.
NUM.23.19	He is not human, so he does not change his mind.
NUM.23.19	Has he ever spoken and failed to act?
NUM.23.19	Has he ever promised and not carried it through?
NUM.23.20	Listen, I received a command to bless;
NUM.23.20	God has blessed, and I cannot reverse it!
NUM.23.21	No misfortune is in his plan for Jacob;
NUM.23.21	no trouble is in store for Israel.
NUM.23.21	For the 
NUM.23.21	he has been proclaimed their king.
NUM.23.22	God brought them out of Egypt;
NUM.23.22	for them he is as strong as a wild ox.
NUM.23.23	No curse can touch Jacob;
NUM.23.23	no magic has any power against Israel.
NUM.23.23	For now it will be said of Jacob,
NUM.23.23	‘What wonders God has done for Israel!’
NUM.23.24	These people rise up like a lioness,
NUM.23.24	like a majestic lion rousing itself.
NUM.23.24	They refuse to rest
NUM.23.24	until they have feasted on prey,
NUM.23.24	drinking the blood of the slaughtered!”
NUM.23.25	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Fine, but if you won’t curse them, at least don’t bless them!”
NUM.23.26	But Balaam replied to Balak, “Didn’t I tell you that I can do only what the 
NUM.23.27	Then King Balak said to Balaam, “Come, I will take you to one more place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them from there.”
NUM.23.28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor, overlooking the wasteland.
NUM.23.29	Balaam again told Balak, “Build me seven altars, and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice.” 
NUM.23.30	So Balak did as Balaam ordered and offered a young bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.24.1	By now Balaam realized that the 
NUM.24.2	where he saw the people of Israel camped, tribe by tribe. Then the Spirit of God came upon him, 
NUM.24.3	and this is the message he delivered:
NUM.24.3	“This is the message of Balaam son of Beor,
NUM.24.3	the message of the man whose eyes see clearly,
NUM.24.4	the message of one who hears the words of God,
NUM.24.4	who sees a vision from the Almighty,
NUM.24.4	who bows down with eyes wide open:
NUM.24.5	How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob;
NUM.24.5	how lovely are your homes, O Israel!
NUM.24.6	They spread before me like palm groves,
NUM.24.6	like gardens by the riverside.
NUM.24.6	They are like tall trees planted by the 
NUM.24.6	like cedars beside the waters.
NUM.24.7	Water will flow from their buckets;
NUM.24.7	their offspring have all they need.
NUM.24.7	Their king will be greater than Agag;
NUM.24.7	their kingdom will be exalted.
NUM.24.8	God brought them out of Egypt;
NUM.24.8	for them he is as strong as a wild ox.
NUM.24.8	He devours all the nations that oppose him,
NUM.24.8	breaking their bones in pieces,
NUM.24.8	shooting them with arrows.
NUM.24.9	Like a lion, Israel crouches and lies down;
NUM.24.9	like a lioness, who dares to arouse her?
NUM.24.9	Blessed is everyone who blesses you, O Israel,
NUM.24.9	and cursed is everyone who curses you.”
NUM.24.10	King Balak flew into a rage against Balaam. He angrily clapped his hands and shouted, “I called you to curse my enemies! Instead, you have blessed them three times. 
NUM.24.11	Now get out of here! Go back home! I promised to reward you richly, but the 
NUM.24.12	Balaam told Balak, “Don’t you remember what I told your messengers? I said, 
NUM.24.13	‘Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold, I would be powerless to do anything against the will of the 
NUM.24.14	Now I am returning to my own people. But first let me tell you what the Israelites will do to your people in the future.”
NUM.24.15	This is the message Balaam delivered:
NUM.24.15	“This is the message of Balaam son of Beor,
NUM.24.15	the message of the man whose eyes see clearly,
NUM.24.16	the message of one who hears the words of God,
NUM.24.16	who has knowledge from the Most High,
NUM.24.16	who sees a vision from the Almighty,
NUM.24.16	who bows down with eyes wide open:
NUM.24.17	I see him, but not here and now.
NUM.24.17	I perceive him, but far in the distant future.
NUM.24.17	A star will rise from Jacob;
NUM.24.17	a scepter will emerge from Israel.
NUM.24.17	It will crush the heads of Moab’s people,
NUM.24.17	cracking the skulls
NUM.24.18	Edom will be taken over,
NUM.24.18	and Seir, its enemy, will be conquered,
NUM.24.18	while Israel marches on in triumph.
NUM.24.19	A ruler will rise in Jacob
NUM.24.19	who will destroy the survivors of Ir.”
NUM.24.20	Then Balaam looked over toward the people of Amalek and delivered this message:
NUM.24.20	“Amalek was the greatest of nations,
NUM.24.20	but its destiny is destruction!”
NUM.24.21	Then he looked over toward the Kenites and delivered this message:
NUM.24.21	“Your home is secure;
NUM.24.21	your nest is set in the rocks.
NUM.24.22	But the Kenites will be destroyed
NUM.24.22	when Assyria
NUM.24.23	Balaam concluded his messages by saying:
NUM.24.23	“Alas, who can survive
NUM.24.23	unless God has willed it?
NUM.24.24	Ships will come from the coasts of Cyprus
NUM.24.24	they will oppress Assyria and afflict Eber,
NUM.24.24	but they, too, will be utterly destroyed.”
NUM.24.25	Then Balaam left and returned home, and Balak also went on his way.
NUM.25.1	While the Israelites were camped at Acacia Grove,
NUM.25.2	These women invited them to attend sacrifices to their gods, so the Israelites feasted with them and worshiped the gods of Moab. 
NUM.25.3	In this way, Israel joined in the worship of Baal of Peor, causing the 
NUM.25.4	The 
NUM.25.5	So Moses ordered Israel’s judges, “Each of you must put to death the men under your authority who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.”
NUM.25.6	Just then one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman into his tent, right before the eyes of Moses and all the people, as everyone was weeping at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
NUM.25.7	When Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest saw this, he jumped up and left the assembly. He took a spear 
NUM.25.8	and rushed after the man into his tent. Phinehas thrust the spear all the way through the man’s body and into the woman’s stomach. So the plague against the Israelites was stopped, 
NUM.25.9	but not before 24,000 people had died.
NUM.25.10	Then the 
NUM.25.11	“Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest has turned my anger away from the Israelites by being as zealous among them as I was. So I stopped destroying all Israel as I had intended to do in my zealous anger. 
NUM.25.12	Now tell him that I am making my special covenant of peace with him. 
NUM.25.13	In this covenant, I give him and his descendants a permanent right to the priesthood, for in his zeal for me, his God, he purified the people of Israel, making them right with me.
NUM.25.14	The Israelite man killed with the Midianite woman was named Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a family from the tribe of Simeon. 
NUM.25.15	The woman’s name was Cozbi; she was the daughter of Zur, the leader of a Midianite clan.
NUM.25.16	Then the 
NUM.25.17	“Attack the Midianites and destroy them, 
NUM.25.18	because they assaulted you with deceit and tricked you into worshiping Baal of Peor, and because of Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, who was killed at the time of the plague because of what happened at Peor.”
NUM.26.1	After the plague had ended,
NUM.26.2	“From the whole community of Israel, record the names of all the warriors by their families. List all the men twenty years old or older who are able to go to war.”
NUM.26.3	So there on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest issued these instructions to the leaders of Israel: 
NUM.26.4	“List all the men of Israel twenty years old and older, just as the 
NUM.26.4	This is the record of all the descendants of Israel who came out of Egypt.

NUM.26.58	The Libnites, the Hebronites, the Mahlites, the Mushites, and the Korahites were all subclans of the Levites.
NUM.26.58	Now Kohath was the ancestor of Amram, 
NUM.26.59	and Amram’s wife was named Jochebed. She also was a descendant of Levi, born among the Levites in the land of Egypt. Amram and Jochebed became the parents of Aaron, Moses, and their sister, Miriam. 
NUM.26.60	To Aaron were born Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
NUM.26.61	But Nadab and Abihu died when they burned before the 
NUM.26.62	The men from the Levite clans who were one month old or older numbered 23,000. But the Levites were not included in the registration of the rest of the people of Israel because they were not given an allotment of land when it was divided among the Israelites.
NUM.26.63	So these are the results of the registration of the people of Israel as conducted by Moses and Eleazar the priest on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho. 
NUM.26.64	Not one person on this list had been among those listed in the previous registration taken by Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Sinai. 
NUM.26.65	For the 
NUM.27.1	One day a petition was presented by the daughters of Zelophehad—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. Their father, Zelophehad, was a descendant of Hepher son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, son of Joseph. 
NUM.27.2	These women stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the tribal leaders, and the entire community at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
NUM.27.3	“Our father died in the wilderness,” they said. “He was not among Korah’s followers, who rebelled against the 
NUM.27.4	Why should the name of our father disappear from his clan just because he had no sons? Give us property along with the rest of our relatives.”
NUM.27.5	So Moses brought their case before the 
NUM.27.6	And the 
NUM.27.7	“The claim of the daughters of Zelophehad is legitimate. You must give them a grant of land along with their father’s relatives. Assign them the property that would have been given to their father.
NUM.27.8	“And give the following instructions to the people of Israel: If a man dies and has no son, then give his inheritance to his daughters. 
NUM.27.9	And if he has no daughter either, transfer his inheritance to his brothers. 
NUM.27.10	If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. 
NUM.27.11	But if his father has no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan. This is a legal requirement for the people of Israel, just as the 
NUM.27.12	One day the 
NUM.27.13	After you have seen it, you will die like your brother, Aaron, 
NUM.27.14	for you both rebelled against my instructions in the wilderness of Zin. When the people of Israel rebelled, you failed to demonstrate my holiness to them at the waters.” (These are the waters of Meribah at Kadesh
NUM.27.15	Then Moses said to the 
NUM.27.16	“O 
NUM.27.17	Give them someone who will guide them wherever they go and will lead them into battle, so the community of the 
NUM.27.18	The

NUM.30.1	Then Moses summoned the leaders of the tribes of Israel and told them, “This is what the 
NUM.30.2	A man who makes a vow to the 
NUM.30.3	“If a young woman makes a vow to the 
NUM.30.4	and her father hears of the vow or pledge and does not object to it, then all her vows and pledges will stand. 
NUM.30.5	But if her father refuses to let her fulfill the vow or pledge on the day he hears of it, then all her vows and pledges will become invalid. The 
NUM.30.6	“Now suppose a young woman makes a vow or binds herself with an impulsive pledge and later marries. 
NUM.30.7	If her husband learns of her vow or pledge and does not object on the day he hears of it, her vows and pledges will stand. 
NUM.30.8	But if her husband refuses to accept her vow or impulsive pledge on the day he hears of it, he nullifies her commitments, and the 
NUM.30.9	If, however, a woman is a widow or is divorced, she must fulfill all her vows and pledges.
NUM.30.10	“But suppose a woman is married and living in her husband’s home when she makes a vow or binds herself with a pledge. 
NUM.30.11	If her husband hears of it and does not object to it, her vow or pledge will stand. 
NUM.30.12	But if her husband refuses to accept it on the day he hears of it, her vow or pledge will be nullified, and the 
NUM.30.13	So her husband may either confirm or nullify any vows or pledges she makes to deny herself. 
NUM.30.14	But if he does not object on the day he hears of it, then he is agreeing to all her vows and pledges. 
NUM.30.15	If he waits more than a day and then tries to nullify a vow or pledge, he will be punished for her guilt.”
NUM.30.16	These are the regulations the 
NUM.31.1	Then the 
NUM.31.2	“On behalf of the people of Israel, take revenge on the Midianites for leading them into idolatry. After that, you will die and join your ancestors.”
NUM.31.3	So Moses said to the people, “Choose some men, and arm them to fight the 
NUM.31.4	From each tribe of Israel, send 1,000 men into battle.” 
NUM.31.5	So they chose 1,000 men from each tribe of Israel, a total of 12,000 men armed for battle. 
NUM.31.6	Then Moses sent them out, 1,000 men from each tribe, and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest led them into battle. They carried along the holy objects of the sanctuary and the trumpets for sounding the charge. 
NUM.31.7	They attacked Midian as the 
NUM.31.8	All five of the Midianite kings—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—died in the battle. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
NUM.31.9	Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their wealth as plunder. 
NUM.31.10	They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived. 
NUM.31.11	After they had gathered the plunder and captives, both people and animals, 
NUM.31.12	they brought them all to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the whole community of Israel, which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho. 
NUM.31.13	Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp. 
NUM.31.14	But Moses was furious with all the generals and captains
NUM.31.15	“Why have you let all the women live?” he demanded. 
NUM.31.16	“These are the very ones who followed Balaam’s advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the 
NUM.31.17	So kill all the boys and all the women who have had intercourse with a man. 
NUM.31.18	Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves. 
NUM.31.19	And all of you who have killed anyone or touched a dead body must stay outside the camp for seven days. You must purify yourselves and your captives on the third and seventh days. 
NUM.31.20	Purify all your clothing, too, and everything made of leather, goat hair, or wood.”
NUM.31.21	Then Eleazar the priest said to the men who were in the battle, “The 
NUM.31.22	Anything made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead—
NUM.31.23	that is, all metals that do not burn—must be passed through fire in order to be made ceremonially pure. These metal objects must then be further purified with the water of purification. But everything that burns must be purified by the water alone. 
NUM.31.24	On the seventh day you must wash your clothes and be purified. Then you may return to the camp.”
NUM.31.25	And the 
NUM.31.26	“You and Eleazar the priest and the family leaders of each tribe are to make a list of all the plunder taken in the battle, including the people and animals. 
NUM.31.27	Then divide the plunder into two parts, and give half to the men who fought the battle and half to the rest of the people. 
NUM.31.28	From the army’s portion, first give the 
NUM.31.29	Give this share of the army’s half to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the 
NUM.31.30	From the half that belongs to the people of Israel, take one of every fifty of the prisoners and of the cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and other animals. Give this share to the Levites, who are in charge of maintaining the 
NUM.31.31	So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the 
NUM.31.32	The plunder remaining from everything the fighting men had taken totaled 675,000 sheep and goats, 
NUM.31.33	72,000 cattle, 
NUM.31.34	61,000 donkeys, 
NUM.31.35	and 32,000 virgin girls.
NUM.31.36	Half of the plunder was given to the fighting men. It totaled 337,500 sheep and goats, 
NUM.31.37	of which 675 were the 
NUM.31.38	36,000 cattle, of which 72 were the 
NUM.31.39	30,500 donkeys, of which 61 were the 
NUM.31.40	and 16,000 virgin girls, of whom 32 were the 
NUM.31.41	Moses gave all the 
NUM.31.42	Half of the plunder belonged to the people of Israel, and Moses separated it from the half belonging to the fighting men. 
NUM.31.43	It totaled 337,500 sheep and goats, 
NUM.31.44	36,000 cattle, 
NUM.31.45	30,500 donkeys, 
NUM.31.46	and 16,000 virgin girls. 
NUM.31.47	From the half-share given to the people, Moses took one of every fifty prisoners and animals and gave them to the Levites, who maintained the 
NUM.31.48	Then all the generals and captains came to Moses 
NUM.31.49	and said, “We, your servants, have accounted for all the men who went out to battle under our command; not one of us is missing! 
NUM.31.50	So we are presenting the items of gold we captured as an offering to the 
NUM.31.51	So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from all the military commanders—all kinds of jewelry and crafted objects. 
NUM.31.52	In all, the gold that the generals and captains presented as a gift to the 
NUM.31.53	All the fighting men had taken some of the plunder for themselves. 
NUM.31.54	So Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gifts from the generals and captains and brought the gold to the Tabernacle
NUM.32.1	The tribes of Reuben and Gad owned vast numbers of livestock. So when they saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were ideally suited for their flocks and herds, 
NUM.32.2	they came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the other leaders of the community. They said, 
NUM.32.3	“Notice the towns of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sibmah,
NUM.32.4	The 
NUM.32.5	If we have found favor with you, please let us have this land as our property instead of giving us land across the Jordan River.”
NUM.32.6	“Do you intend to stay here while your brothers go across and do all the fighting?” Moses asked the men of Gad and Reuben. 
NUM.32.7	“Why do you want to discourage the rest of the people of Israel from going across to the land the 
NUM.32.8	Your ancestors did the same thing when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land. 
NUM.32.9	After they went up to the valley of Eshcol and explored the land, they discouraged the people of Israel from entering the land the 
NUM.32.10	Then the 
NUM.32.11	‘Of all those I rescued from Egypt, no one who is twenty years old or older will ever see the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for they have not obeyed me wholeheartedly. 
NUM.32.12	The only exceptions are Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they have wholeheartedly followed the 
NUM.32.13	“The 
NUM.32.14	But here you are, a brood of sinners, doing exactly the same thing! You are making the 
NUM.32.15	If you turn away from him like this and he abandons them again in the wilderness, you will be responsible for destroying this entire nation!”
NUM.32.16	But they approached Moses and said, “We simply want to build pens for our livestock and fortified towns for our wives and children. 
NUM.32.17	Then we will arm ourselves and lead our fellow Israelites into battle until we have brought them safely to their land. Meanwhile, our families will stay in the fortified towns we build here, so they will be safe from any attacks by the local people. 
NUM.32.18	We will not return to our homes until all the people of Israel have received their portions of land. 
NUM.32.19	But we do not claim any of the land on the other side of the Jordan. We would rather live here on the east side and accept this as our grant of land.”
NUM.32.20	Then Moses said, “If you keep your word and arm yourselves for the 
NUM.32.21	and if your troops cross the Jordan and keep fighting until the 
NUM.32.22	then you may return when the 
NUM.32.23	But if you fail to keep your word, then you will have sinned against the 
NUM.32.24	Go ahead and build towns for your families and pens for your flocks, but do everything you have promised.”
NUM.32.25	Then the men of Gad and Reuben replied, “We, your servants, will follow your instructions exactly. 
NUM.32.26	Our children, wives, flocks, and cattle will stay here in the towns of Gilead. 
NUM.32.27	But all who are able to bear arms will cross over to fight for the 
NUM.32.28	So Moses gave orders to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the clans of Israel. 
NUM.32.29	He said, “The men of Gad and Reuben who are armed for battle must cross the Jordan with you to fight for the 
NUM.32.30	But if they refuse to arm themselves and cross over with you, then they must accept land with the rest of you in the land of Canaan.”
NUM.32.31	The tribes of Gad and Reuben said again, “We are your servants, and we will do as the 
NUM.32.32	We will cross the Jordan into Canaan fully armed to fight for the 
NUM.32.33	So Moses assigned land to the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph. He gave them the territory of King Sihon of the Amorites and the land of King Og of Bashan—the whole land with its cities and surrounding lands.
NUM.32.34	The descendants of Gad built the towns of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
NUM.32.35	Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
NUM.32.36	Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran. These were all fortified towns with pens for their flocks.
NUM.32.37	The descendants of Reuben built the towns of Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
NUM.32.38	Nebo, Baal-meon, and Sibmah. They changed the names of some of the towns they conquered and rebuilt.
NUM.32.39	Then the descendants of Makir of the tribe of Manasseh went to Gilead and conquered it, and they drove out the Amorites living there. 
NUM.32.40	So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there. 
NUM.32.41	The people of Jair, another clan of the tribe of Manasseh, captured many of the towns in Gilead and changed the name of that region to the Towns of Jair.
NUM.32.42	Meanwhile, a man named Nobah captured the town of Kenath and its surrounding villages, and he renamed that area Nobah after himself.
NUM.33.1	This is the route the Israelites followed as they marched out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.33.2	At the 
NUM.33.3	They set out from the city of Rameses in early spring—on the fifteenth day of the first month
NUM.33.4	Meanwhile, the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn sons, whom the 
NUM.33.5	After leaving Rameses, the Israelites set up camp at Succoth.
NUM.33.6	Then they left Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.

NUM.33.53	Take possession of the land and settle in it, because I have given it to you to occupy. 
NUM.33.54	You must distribute the land among the clans by sacred lot and in proportion to their size. A larger portion of land will be allotted to each of the larger clans, and a smaller portion will be allotted to each of the smaller clans. The decision of the sacred lot is final. In this way, the portions of land will be divided among your ancestral tribes. 
NUM.33.55	But if you fail to drive out the people who live in the land, those who remain will be like splinters in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will harass you in the land where you live.

NUM.34.10	“The eastern boundary will start at Hazar-enan and run south to Shepham,

NUM.34.13	Then Moses told the Israelites, “This territory is the homeland you are to divide among yourselves by sacred lot. The

NUM.35.3	These towns will be for the Levites to live in, and the surrounding lands will provide pasture for their cattle, flocks, and other livestock. 
NUM.35.4	The pastureland assigned to the Levites around these towns will extend 1,500 feet

NUM.35.6	“Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, where a person who has accidentally killed someone can flee for safety. In addition, give them forty-two other towns. 
NUM.35.7	In all, forty-eight towns with the surrounding pastureland will be given to the Levites. 
NUM.35.8	These towns will come from the property of the people of Israel. The larger tribes will give more towns to the Levites, while the smaller tribes will give fewer. Each tribe will give property in proportion to the size of its land.”
NUM.35.9	The 
NUM.35.10	“Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.
NUM.35.10	“When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
NUM.35.11	designate cities of refuge to which people can flee if they have killed someone accidentally. 
NUM.35.12	These cities will be places of protection from a dead person’s relatives who want to avenge the death. The slayer must not be put to death before being tried by the community. 
NUM.35.13	Designate six cities of refuge for yourselves, 
NUM.35.14	three on the east side of the Jordan River and three on the west in the land of Canaan. 
NUM.35.15	These cities are for the protection of Israelites, foreigners living among you, and traveling merchants. Anyone who accidentally kills someone may flee there for safety.
NUM.35.16	“But if someone strikes and kills another person with a piece of iron, it is murder, and the murderer must be executed. 
NUM.35.17	Or if someone with a stone in his hand strikes and kills another person, it is murder, and the murderer must be put to death. 
NUM.35.18	Or if someone strikes and kills another person with a wooden object, it is murder, and the murderer must be put to death. 
NUM.35.19	The victim’s nearest relative is responsible for putting the murderer to death. When they meet, the avenger must put the murderer to death. 
NUM.35.20	So if someone hates another person and waits in ambush, then pushes him or throws something at him and he dies, it is murder. 
NUM.35.21	Or if someone hates another person and hits him with a fist and he dies, it is murder. In such cases, the avenger must put the murderer to death when they meet.
NUM.35.22	“But suppose someone pushes another person without having shown previous hostility, or throws something that unintentionally hits another person, 
NUM.35.23	or accidentally drops a huge stone on someone, though they were not enemies, and the person dies. 
NUM.35.24	If this should happen, the community must follow these regulations in making a judgment between the slayer and the avenger, the victim’s nearest relative: 
NUM.35.25	The community must protect the slayer from the avenger and must escort the slayer back to live in the city of refuge to which he fled. There he must remain until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the sacred oil.
NUM.35.26	“But if the slayer ever leaves the limits of the city of refuge, 
NUM.35.27	and the avenger finds him outside the city and kills him, it will not be considered murder. 
NUM.35.28	The slayer should have stayed inside the city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest, the slayer may return to his own property. 
NUM.35.29	These are legal requirements for you to observe from generation to generation, wherever you may live.
NUM.35.30	“All murderers must be put to death, but only if evidence is presented by more than one witness. No one may be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. 
NUM.35.31	Also, you must never accept a ransom payment for the life of someone judged guilty of murder and subject to execution; murderers must always be put to death. 
NUM.35.32	And never accept a ransom payment from someone who has fled to a city of refuge, allowing a slayer to return to his property before the death of the high priest. 
NUM.35.33	This will ensure that the land where you live will not be polluted, for murder pollutes the land. And no sacrifice except the execution of the murderer can purify the land from murder.

NUM.36.2	They said, “Sir, the 
NUM.36.3	But if they marry men from another tribe, their grants of land will go with them to the tribe into which they marry. In this way, the total area of our tribal land will be reduced. 
NUM.36.4	Then when the Year of Jubilee comes, their portion of land will be added to that of the new tribe, causing it to be lost forever to our ancestral tribe.”
NUM.36.5	So Moses gave the Israelites this command from the 
NUM.36.6	This is what the 
NUM.36.7	None of the territorial land may pass from tribe to tribe, for all the land given to each tribe must remain within the tribe to which it was first allotted. 
NUM.36.8	The daughters throughout the tribes of Israel who are in line to inherit property must marry within their tribe, so that all the Israelites will keep their ancestral property. 
NUM.36.9	No grant of land may pass from one tribe to another; each tribe of Israel must keep its allotted portion of land.”
NUM.36.10	The daughters of Zelophehad did as the 
NUM.36.11	Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah all married cousins on their father’s side. 
NUM.36.12	They married into the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. Thus, their inheritance of land remained within their ancestral tribe.
NUM.36.13	These are the commands and regulations that the 
DEU.1.1	These are the words that Moses spoke to all the people of Israel while they were in the wilderness east of the Jordan River. They were camped in the Jordan Valley
DEU.1.2	Normally it takes only eleven days to travel from Mount Sinai
DEU.1.3	But forty years after the Israelites left Egypt, on the first day of the eleventh month,
DEU.1.4	This took place after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated King Og of Bashan, who ruled in Ashtaroth.
DEU.1.5	While the Israelites were in the land of Moab east of the Jordan River, Moses carefully explained the 
DEU.1.6	“When we were at Mount Sinai, the 
DEU.1.7	It is time to break camp and move on. Go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the neighboring regions—the Jordan Valley, the hill country, the western foothills,
DEU.1.8	Look, I am giving all this land to you! Go in and occupy it, for it is the land the 
DEU.1.9	Moses continued, “At that time I told you, ‘You are too great a burden for me to carry all by myself. 
DEU.1.10	The 
DEU.1.11	And may the 
DEU.1.12	But you are such a heavy load to carry! How can I deal with all your problems and bickering? 
DEU.1.13	Choose some well-respected men from each tribe who are known for their wisdom and understanding, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’
DEU.1.14	“Then you responded, ‘Your plan is a good one.’ 
DEU.1.15	So I took the wise and respected men you had selected from your tribes and appointed them to serve as judges and officials over you. Some were responsible for a thousand people, some for a hundred, some for fifty, and some for ten.
DEU.1.16	“At that time I instructed the judges, ‘You must hear the cases of your fellow Israelites and the foreigners living among you. Be perfectly fair in your decisions 
DEU.1.17	and impartial in your judgments. Hear the cases of those who are poor as well as those who are rich. Don’t be afraid of anyone’s anger, for the decision you make is God’s decision. Bring me any cases that are too difficult for you, and I will handle them.’
DEU.1.18	“At that time I gave you instructions about everything you were to do.
DEU.1.19	“Then, just as the 
DEU.1.20	I said to you, ‘You have now reached the hill country of the Amorites that the 
DEU.1.21	Look! He has placed the land in front of you. Go and occupy it as the 
DEU.1.22	“But you all came to me and said, ‘First, let’s send out scouts to explore the land for us. They will advise us on the best route to take and which towns we should enter.’
DEU.1.23	“This seemed like a good idea to me, so I chose twelve scouts, one from each of your tribes. 
DEU.1.24	They headed for the hill country and came to the valley of Eshcol and explored it. 
DEU.1.25	They picked some of its fruit and brought it back to us. And they reported, ‘The land the 
DEU.1.26	“But you rebelled against the command of the 
DEU.1.27	You complained in your tents and said, ‘The 
DEU.1.28	Where can we go? Our brothers have demoralized us with their report. They tell us, “The people of the land are taller and more powerful than we are, and their towns are large, with walls rising high into the sky! We even saw giants there—the descendants of Anak!”’
DEU.1.29	“But I said to you, ‘Don’t be shocked or afraid of them! 
DEU.1.30	The 
DEU.1.31	And you saw how the 
DEU.1.32	“But even after all he did, you refused to trust the 
DEU.1.33	who goes before you looking for the best places to camp, guiding you with a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day.
DEU.1.34	“When the 
DEU.1.35	‘Not one of you from this wicked generation will live to see the good land I swore to give your ancestors, 
DEU.1.36	except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see this land because he has followed the 
DEU.1.37	“And the 
DEU.1.38	Instead, your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will lead the people into the land. Encourage him, for he will lead Israel as they take possession of it. 
DEU.1.39	I will give the land to your little ones—your innocent children. You were afraid they would be captured, but they will be the ones who occupy it. 
DEU.1.40	As for you, turn around now and go on back through the wilderness toward the Red Sea.
DEU.1.41	“Then you confessed, ‘We have sinned against the 
DEU.1.42	“But the 
DEU.1.43	“This is what I told you, but you would not listen. Instead, you again rebelled against the 
DEU.1.44	But the Amorites who lived there came out against you like a swarm of bees. They chased and battered you all the way from Seir to Hormah. 
DEU.1.45	Then you returned and wept before the 
DEU.1.46	So you stayed there at Kadesh for a long time.
DEU.2.1	“Then we turned around and headed back across the wilderness toward the Red Sea,
DEU.2.2	“Then at last the 
DEU.2.3	‘You have been wandering around in this hill country long enough; turn to the north. 
DEU.2.4	Give these orders to the people: “You will pass through the country belonging to your relatives the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. The Edomites will feel threatened, so be careful. 
DEU.2.5	Do not bother them, for I have given them all the hill country around Mount Seir as their property, and I will not give you even one square foot of their land. 
DEU.2.6	If you need food to eat or water to drink, pay them for it. 
DEU.2.7	For the 
DEU.2.8	“So we bypassed the territory of our relatives, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We avoided the road through the Arabah Valley that comes up from Elath and Ezion-geber.
DEU.2.8	“Then as we turned north along the desert route through Moab, 
DEU.2.9	the 
DEU.2.10	(A race of giants called the Emites had once lived in the area of Ar. They were as strong and numerous and tall as the Anakites, another race of giants. 
DEU.2.11	Both the Emites and the Anakites are also known as the Rephaites, though the Moabites call them Emites. 
DEU.2.12	In earlier times the Horites had lived in Seir, but they were driven out and displaced by the descendants of Esau, just as Israel drove out the people of Canaan when the 
DEU.2.13	Moses continued, “Then the 
DEU.2.14	“Thirty-eight years passed from the time we first left Kadesh-barnea until we finally crossed the Zered Brook! By then, all the men old enough to fight in battle had died in the wilderness, as the 
DEU.2.15	The 
DEU.2.16	“When all the men of fighting age had died, 
DEU.2.17	the 
DEU.2.18	‘Today you will cross the border of Moab at Ar 
DEU.2.19	and enter the land of the Ammonites, the descendants of Lot. But do not bother them or start a war with them. I have given the land of Ammon to them as their property, and I will not give you any of their land.’”
DEU.2.20	(That area was once considered the land of the Rephaites, who had lived there, though the Ammonites call them Zamzummites. 
DEU.2.21	They were also as strong and numerous and tall as the Anakites. But the 
DEU.2.22	He had done the same for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, for he destroyed the Horites so they could settle there in their place. The descendants of Esau live there to this day. 
DEU.2.23	A similar thing happened when the Caphtorites from Crete
DEU.2.24	Moses continued, “Then the 
DEU.2.25	Beginning today I will make people throughout the earth terrified because of you. When they hear reports about you, they will tremble with dread and fear.’”
DEU.2.26	Moses continued, “From the wilderness of Kedemoth I sent ambassadors to King Sihon of Heshbon with this proposal of peace:
DEU.2.27	‘Let us travel through your land. We will stay on the main road and won’t turn off into the fields on either side. 
DEU.2.28	Sell us food to eat and water to drink, and we will pay for it. All we want is permission to pass through your land. 
DEU.2.29	The descendants of Esau who live in Seir allowed us to go through their country, and so did the Moabites, who live in Ar. Let us pass through until we cross the Jordan into the land the 
DEU.2.30	“But King Sihon of Heshbon refused to allow us to pass through, because the 
DEU.2.31	“Then the 
DEU.2.32	“Then King Sihon declared war on us and mobilized his forces at Jahaz. 
DEU.2.33	But the 
DEU.2.34	We conquered all his towns and completely destroyed
DEU.2.35	We took all the livestock as plunder for ourselves, along with anything of value from the towns we ransacked.
DEU.2.36	“The 
DEU.2.37	However, we avoided the land of the Ammonites all along the Jabbok River and the towns in the hill country—all the places the 
DEU.3.1	“Next we turned and headed for the land of Bashan, where King Og and his entire army attacked us at Edrei. 
DEU.3.2	But the 
DEU.3.3	“So the 
DEU.3.4	We conquered all sixty of his towns—the entire Argob region in his kingdom of Bashan. Not a single town escaped our conquest. 
DEU.3.5	These towns were all fortified with high walls and barred gates. We also took many unwalled villages at the same time. 
DEU.3.6	We completely destroyed
DEU.3.7	But we kept all the livestock for ourselves and took plunder from all the towns.
DEU.3.8	“So we took the land of the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River—all the way from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon. 
DEU.3.9	(Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians, and the Amorites call it Senir.) 
DEU.3.10	We had now conquered all the cities on the plateau and all Gilead and Bashan, as far as the towns of Salecah and Edrei, which were part of Og’s kingdom in Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	(King Og of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide.
DEU.3.12	“When we took possession of this land, I gave to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory beyond Aroer along the Arnon Gorge, plus half of the hill country of Gilead with its towns. 
DEU.3.13	Then I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan—Og’s former kingdom—to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (This entire Argob region of Bashan used to be known as the land of the Rephaites. 
DEU.3.14	Jair, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh, conquered the whole Argob region in Bashan, all the way to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. Jair renamed this region after himself, calling it the Towns of Jair,
DEU.3.15	I gave Gilead to the clan of Makir. 
DEU.3.16	But I also gave part of Gilead to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The area I gave them extended from the middle of the Arnon Gorge in the south to the Jabbok River on the Ammonite frontier. 
DEU.3.17	They also received the Jordan Valley, all the way from the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea,
DEU.3.18	“At that time I gave this command to the tribes that would live east of the Jordan: ‘Although the 
DEU.3.19	Your wives, children, and numerous livestock, however, may stay behind in the towns I have given you. 
DEU.3.20	When the 
DEU.3.21	“At that time I gave Joshua this charge: ‘You have seen for yourself everything the 
DEU.3.22	Do not be afraid of the nations there, for the 
DEU.3.23	“At that time I pleaded with the 
DEU.3.24	‘O Sovereign 
DEU.3.25	Please let me cross the Jordan to see the wonderful land on the other side, the beautiful hill country and the Lebanon mountains.’
DEU.3.26	“But the 
DEU.3.27	But go up to Pisgah Peak, and look over the land in every direction. Take a good look, but you may not cross the Jordan River. 
DEU.3.28	Instead, commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead the people across the Jordan. He will give them all the land you now see before you as their possession.’ 
DEU.3.29	So we stayed in the valley near Beth-peor.
DEU.4.1	“And now, Israel, listen carefully to these decrees and regulations that I am about to teach you. Obey them so that you may live, so you may enter and occupy the land that the 
DEU.4.2	Do not add to or subtract from these commands I am giving you. Just obey the commands of the 
DEU.4.3	“You saw for yourself what the 
DEU.4.4	But all of you who were faithful to the 
DEU.4.5	“Look, I now teach you these decrees and regulations just as the 
DEU.4.6	Obey them completely, and you will display your wisdom and intelligence among the surrounding nations. When they hear all these decrees, they will exclaim, ‘How wise and prudent are the people of this great nation!’ 
DEU.4.7	For what great nation has a god as near to them as the 
DEU.4.8	And what great nation has decrees and regulations as righteous and fair as this body of instructions that I am giving you today?
DEU.4.9	“But watch out! Be careful never to forget what you yourself have seen. Do not let these memories escape from your mind as long as you live! And be sure to pass them on to your children and grandchildren. 
DEU.4.10	Never forget the day when you stood before the 
DEU.4.11	“You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while flames from the mountain shot into the sky. The mountain was shrouded in black clouds and deep darkness. 
DEU.4.12	And the 
DEU.4.13	He proclaimed his covenant—the Ten Commandments

DEU.4.17	an animal on the ground, a bird in the sky, 
DEU.4.18	a small animal that scurries along the ground, or a fish in the deepest sea. 
DEU.4.19	And when you look up into the sky and see the sun, moon, and stars—all the forces of heaven—don’t be seduced into worshiping them. The 
DEU.4.20	Remember that the 
DEU.4.21	“But the 
DEU.4.22	You will cross the Jordan to occupy the land, but I will not. Instead, I will die here on the east side of the river. 
DEU.4.23	So be careful not to break the covenant the 
DEU.4.24	The 
DEU.4.25	“In the future, when you have children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time, do not corrupt yourselves by making idols of any kind. This is evil in the sight of the 
DEU.4.26	“Today I call on heaven and earth as witnesses against you. If you break my covenant, you will quickly disappear from the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy. You will live there only a short time; then you will be utterly destroyed. 
DEU.4.27	For the 
DEU.4.28	There, in a foreign land, you will worship idols made from wood and stone—gods that neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell. 
DEU.4.29	But from there you will search again for the 
DEU.4.30	“In the distant future, when you are suffering all these things, you will finally return to the 
DEU.4.31	For the 
DEU.4.32	“Now search all of history, from the time God created people on the earth until now, and search from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything as great as this ever been seen or heard before? 
DEU.4.33	Has any nation ever heard the voice of God
DEU.4.34	Has any other god dared to take a nation for himself out of another nation by means of trials, miraculous signs, wonders, war, a strong hand, a powerful arm, and terrifying acts? Yet that is what the 
DEU.4.35	“He showed you these things so you would know that the 
DEU.4.36	He let you hear his voice from heaven so he could instruct you. He let you see his great fire here on earth so he could speak to you from it. 
DEU.4.37	Because he loved your ancestors, he chose to bless their descendants, and he personally brought you out of Egypt with a great display of power. 
DEU.4.38	He drove out nations far greater than you, so he could bring you in and give you their land as your special possession, as it is today.
DEU.4.39	“So remember this and keep it firmly in mind: The 
DEU.4.40	If you obey all the decrees and commands I am giving you today, all will be well with you and your children. I am giving you these instructions so you will enjoy a long life in the land the 
DEU.4.41	Then Moses set apart three cities of refuge east of the Jordan River. 
DEU.4.42	Anyone who killed another person unintentionally, without previous hostility, could flee there to live in safety. 
DEU.4.43	These were the cities: Bezer on the wilderness plateau for the tribe of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead for the tribe of Gad; Golan in Bashan for the tribe of Manasseh.
DEU.4.44	This is the body of instruction that Moses presented to the Israelites. 
DEU.4.45	These are the laws, decrees, and regulations that Moses gave to the people of Israel when they left Egypt, 
DEU.4.46	and as they camped in the valley near Beth-peor east of the Jordan River. (This land was formerly occupied by the Amorites under King Sihon, who ruled from Heshbon. But Moses and the Israelites destroyed him and his people when they came up from Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	Israel took possession of his land and that of King Og of Bashan—the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan. 
DEU.4.48	So Israel conquered the entire area from Aroer at the edge of the Arnon Gorge all the way to Mount Sirion,
DEU.4.49	And they conquered the eastern bank of the Jordan River as far south as the Dead Sea,
DEU.5.1	Moses called all the people of Israel together and said, “Listen carefully, Israel. Hear the decrees and regulations I am giving you today, so you may learn them and obey them!

DEU.5.13	You have six days each week for your ordinary work, 
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the

DEU.5.23	“But when you heard the voice from the heart of the darkness, while the mountain was blazing with fire, all your tribal leaders and elders came to me. 
DEU.5.24	They said, ‘Look, the 
DEU.5.25	But now, why should we risk death again? If the 
DEU.5.26	Can any living thing hear the voice of the living God from the heart of the fire as we did and yet survive? 
DEU.5.27	Go yourself and listen to what the 
DEU.5.28	“The 
DEU.5.29	Oh, that they would always have hearts like this, that they might fear me and obey all my commands! If they did, they and their descendants would prosper forever. 
DEU.5.30	Go and tell them, “Return to your tents.” 
DEU.5.31	But you stand here with me so I can give you all my commands, decrees, and regulations. You must teach them to the people so they can obey them in the land I am giving them as their possession.’”

DEU.6.2	and you and your children and grandchildren must fear the

DEU.6.4	“Listen, O Israel! The 
DEU.6.5	And you must love the 
DEU.6.6	And you must commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these commands that I am giving you today. 
DEU.6.7	Repeat them again and again to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting up. 
DEU.6.8	Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders. 
DEU.6.9	Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
DEU.6.10	“The 
DEU.6.11	The houses will be richly stocked with goods you did not produce. You will draw water from cisterns you did not dig, and you will eat from vineyards and olive trees you did not plant. When you have eaten your fill in this land, 
DEU.6.12	be careful not to forget the 
DEU.6.13	You must fear the 
DEU.6.14	“You must not worship any of the gods of neighboring nations, 
DEU.6.15	for the 
DEU.6.16	You must not test the 
DEU.6.17	You must diligently obey the commands of the 
DEU.6.18	Do what is right and good in the 
DEU.6.19	You will drive out all the enemies living in the land, just as the

DEU.6.25	For we will be counted as righteous when we obey all the commands the 
DEU.7.1	“When the 
DEU.7.2	When the 
DEU.7.3	You must not intermarry with them. Do not let your daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters, 
DEU.7.4	for they will lead your children away from me to worship other gods. Then the anger of the 
DEU.7.5	This is what you must do. You must break down their pagan altars and shatter their sacred pillars. Cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols.

DEU.7.12	“If you listen to these regulations and faithfully obey them, the 
DEU.7.13	He will love you and bless you, and he will give you many children. He will give fertility to your land and your animals. When you arrive in the land he swore to give your ancestors, you will have large harvests of grain, new wine, and olive oil, and great herds of cattle, sheep, and goats. 
DEU.7.14	You will be blessed above all the nations of the earth. None of your men or women will be childless, and all your livestock will bear young. 
DEU.7.15	And the 
DEU.7.16	“You must destroy all the nations the 
DEU.7.17	Perhaps you will think to yourselves, ‘How can we ever conquer these nations that are so much more powerful than we are?’ 
DEU.7.18	But don’t be afraid of them! Just remember what the 
DEU.7.19	Remember the great terrors the 
DEU.7.20	And then the 
DEU.7.21	“No, do not be afraid of those nations, for the 
DEU.7.22	The 
DEU.7.23	But the 
DEU.7.24	He will put their kings in your power, and you will erase their names from the face of the earth. No one will be able to stand against you, and you will destroy them all.
DEU.7.25	“You must burn their idols in fire, and you must not covet the silver or gold that covers them. You must not take it or it will become a trap to you, for it is detestable to the 
DEU.7.26	Do not bring any detestable objects into your home, for then you will be destroyed, just like them. You must utterly detest such things, for they are set apart for destruction.
DEU.8.1	“Be careful to obey all the commands I am giving you today. Then you will live and multiply, and you will enter and occupy the land the 
DEU.8.2	Remember how the 
DEU.8.3	Yes, he humbled you by letting you go hungry and then feeding you with manna, a food previously unknown to you and your ancestors. He did it to teach you that people do not live by bread alone; rather, we live by every word that comes from the mouth of the 
DEU.8.4	For all these forty years your clothes didn’t wear out, and your feet didn’t blister or swell. 
DEU.8.5	Think about it: Just as a parent disciplines a child, the 
DEU.8.6	“So obey the commands of the 
DEU.8.7	For the 
DEU.8.8	It is a land of wheat and barley; of grapevines, fig trees, and pomegranates; of olive oil and honey. 
DEU.8.9	It is a land where food is plentiful and nothing is lacking. It is a land where iron is as common as stone, and copper is abundant in the hills. 
DEU.8.10	When you have eaten your fill, be sure to praise the 
DEU.8.11	“But that is the time to be careful! Beware that in your plenty you do not forget the 
DEU.8.12	For when you have become full and prosperous and have built fine homes to live in, 
DEU.8.13	and when your flocks and herds have become very large and your silver and gold have multiplied along with everything else, be careful! 
DEU.8.14	Do not become proud at that time and forget the 
DEU.8.15	Do not forget that he led you through the great and terrifying wilderness with its poisonous snakes and scorpions, where it was so hot and dry. He gave you water from the rock! 
DEU.8.16	He fed you with manna in the wilderness, a food unknown to your ancestors. He did this to humble you and test you for your own good. 
DEU.8.17	He did all this so you would never say to yourself, ‘I have achieved this wealth with my own strength and energy.’ 
DEU.8.18	Remember the 
DEU.8.19	“But I assure you of this: If you ever forget the 
DEU.8.20	Just as the 
DEU.9.1	“Listen, O Israel! Today you are about to cross the Jordan River to take over the land belonging to nations much greater and more powerful than you. They live in cities with walls that reach to the sky! 
DEU.9.2	The people are strong and tall—descendants of the famous Anakite giants. You’ve heard the saying, ‘Who can stand up to the Anakites?’ 
DEU.9.3	But recognize today that the 
DEU.9.4	“After the 
DEU.9.5	It is not because you are so good or have such integrity that you are about to occupy their land. The 
DEU.9.6	You must recognize that the 
DEU.9.7	“Remember and never forget how angry you made the 
DEU.9.8	Even at Mount Sinai
DEU.9.9	This happened when I was on the mountain receiving the tablets of stone inscribed with the words of the covenant that the 
DEU.9.10	The 
DEU.9.11	“At the end of the forty days and nights, the 
DEU.9.12	Then the 
DEU.9.13	“The 
DEU.9.14	Leave me alone so I may destroy them and erase their name from under heaven. Then I will make a mighty nation of your descendants, a nation larger and more powerful than they are.’
DEU.9.15	“So while the mountain was blazing with fire I turned and came down, holding in my hands the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant. 
DEU.9.16	There below me I could see that you had sinned against the 
DEU.9.17	So I took the stone tablets and threw them to the ground, smashing them before your eyes.
DEU.9.18	“Then, as before, I threw myself down before the 
DEU.9.19	I feared that the furious anger of the 
DEU.9.20	The 
DEU.9.21	I took your sin—the calf you had made—and I melted it down in the fire and ground it into fine dust. Then I threw the dust into the stream that flows down the mountain.
DEU.9.22	“You also made the 
DEU.9.23	And at Kadesh-barnea the 
DEU.9.24	Yes, you have been rebelling against the 
DEU.9.25	“That is why I threw myself down before the 
DEU.9.26	I prayed to the 
DEU.9.27	Please overlook the stubbornness and the awful sin of these people, and remember instead your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
DEU.9.28	If you destroy these people, the Egyptians will say, “The Israelites died because the 
DEU.9.29	But they are your people and your special possession, whom you brought out of Egypt by your great strength and powerful arm.’
DEU.10.1	“At that time the 
DEU.10.2	and I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the ones you smashed. Then place the tablets in the Ark.’
DEU.10.3	“So I made an Ark of acacia wood and cut two stone tablets like the first two. Then I went up the mountain with the tablets in my hand. 
DEU.10.4	Once again the 
DEU.10.5	Then I turned and came down the mountain and placed the tablets in the Ark of the Covenant, which I had made, just as the 
DEU.10.6	(The people of Israel set out from the wells of the people of Jaakan
DEU.10.7	Then they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from there to Jotbathah, a land with many brooks and streams. 
DEU.10.8	At that time the 
DEU.10.9	That is why the Levites have no share of property or possession of land among the other Israelite tribes. The 
DEU.10.10	“As for me, I stayed on the mountain in the 
DEU.10.11	Then the 
DEU.10.12	“And now, Israel, what does the 
DEU.10.13	And you must always obey the 
DEU.10.14	“Look, the highest heavens and the earth and everything in it all belong to the 
DEU.10.15	Yet the 
DEU.10.16	Therefore, change your hearts
DEU.10.17	“For the 
DEU.10.18	He ensures that orphans and widows receive justice. He shows love to the foreigners living among you and gives them food and clothing. 
DEU.10.19	So you, too, must show love to foreigners, for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	You must fear the 
DEU.10.21	He alone is your God, the only one who is worthy of your praise, the one who has done these mighty miracles that you have seen with your own eyes. 
DEU.10.22	When your ancestors went down into Egypt, there were only seventy of them. But now the 
DEU.11.1	“You must love the 
DEU.11.2	Keep in mind that I am not talking now to your children, who have never experienced the discipline of the 
DEU.11.3	They didn’t see the miraculous signs and wonders he performed in Egypt against Pharaoh and all his land. 
DEU.11.4	They didn’t see what the 
DEU.11.5	“Your children didn’t see how the 
DEU.11.6	They didn’t see what he did to Dathan and Abiram (the sons of Eliab, a descendant of Reuben) when the earth opened its mouth in the Israelite camp and swallowed them, along with their households and tents and every living thing that belonged to them. 
DEU.11.7	But you have seen the 
DEU.11.8	“Therefore, be careful to obey every command I am giving you today, so you may have strength to go in and take over the land you are about to enter. 
DEU.11.9	If you obey, you will enjoy a long life in the land the 
DEU.11.10	For the land you are about to enter and take over is not like the land of Egypt from which you came, where you planted your seed and made irrigation ditches with your foot as in a vegetable garden. 
DEU.11.11	Rather, the land you will soon take over is a land of hills and valleys with plenty of rain—
DEU.11.12	a land that the 
DEU.11.13	“If you carefully obey the commands I am giving you today, and if you love the 
DEU.11.14	then he will send the rains in their proper seasons—the early and late rains—so you can bring in your harvests of grain, new wine, and olive oil. 
DEU.11.15	He will give you lush pastureland for your livestock, and you yourselves will have all you want to eat.
DEU.11.16	“But be careful. Don’t let your heart be deceived so that you turn away from the 
DEU.11.17	If you do, the 
DEU.11.18	“So commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these words of mine. Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders. 
DEU.11.19	Teach them to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting up. 
DEU.11.20	Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, 
DEU.11.21	so that as long as the sky remains above the earth, you and your children may flourish in the land the 
DEU.11.22	“Be careful to obey all these commands I am giving you. Show love to the 
DEU.11.23	Then the 
DEU.11.24	Wherever you set foot, that land will be yours. Your frontiers will stretch from the wilderness in the south to Lebanon in the north, and from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.
DEU.11.25	No one will be able to stand against you, for the 
DEU.11.26	“Look, today I am giving you the choice between a blessing and a curse! 
DEU.11.27	You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the 
DEU.11.28	But you will be cursed if you reject the commands of the 
DEU.11.29	“When the

DEU.12.6	There you will bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, your sacred offerings, your offerings to fulfill a vow, your voluntary offerings, and your offerings of the firstborn animals of your herds and flocks.

DEU.12.9	because you have not yet arrived at the place of rest, the land the 
DEU.12.10	But you will soon cross the Jordan River and live in the land the 
DEU.12.11	you must bring everything I command you—your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, your sacred offerings, and your offerings to fulfill a vow—to the designated place of worship, the place the 
DEU.12.12	“You must celebrate there in the presence of the 
DEU.12.13	Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings just anywhere you like. 
DEU.12.14	You may do so only at the place the 
DEU.12.15	“But you may butcher your animals and eat their meat in any town whenever you want. You may freely eat the animals with which the

DEU.12.22	Anyone, whether ceremonially clean or unclean, may eat that meat, just as you do now with gazelle and deer. 
DEU.12.23	But never consume the blood, for the blood is the life, and you must not consume the lifeblood with the meat. 
DEU.12.24	Instead, pour out the blood on the ground like water.

DEU.13.14	In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find that the report is true and such a detestable act has been committed among you, 
DEU.13.15	you must attack that town and completely destroy
DEU.13.16	Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the open square and burn it. Burn the entire town as a burnt offering to the

DEU.14.6	“You may eat any animal that has completely split hooves and chews the cud, 
DEU.14.7	but if the animal doesn’t have both, it may not be eaten. So you may not eat the camel, the hare, or the hyrax.
DEU.14.8	And you may not eat the pig. It has split hooves but does not chew the cud, so it is ceremonially unclean for you. You may not eat the meat of these animals or even touch their carcasses.
DEU.14.9	“Of all the marine animals, you may eat whatever has both fins and scales. 
DEU.14.10	You may not, however, eat marine animals that do not have both fins and scales. They are ceremonially unclean for you.

DEU.14.12	These are the birds you may not eat: the griffon vulture, the bearded vulture, the black vulture, 
DEU.14.13	the kite, the falcon, buzzards of all kinds, 
DEU.14.14	ravens of all kinds, 
DEU.14.15	the eagle owl, the short-eared owl, the seagull, hawks of all kinds,

DEU.14.20	But you may eat any winged bird or insect that is ceremonially clean.
DEU.14.21	“You must not eat anything that has died a natural death. You may give it to a foreigner living in your town, or you may sell it to a stranger. But do not eat it yourselves, for you are set apart as holy to the 
DEU.14.21	“You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
DEU.14.22	“You must set aside a tithe of your crops—one-tenth of all the crops you harvest each year. 
DEU.14.23	Bring this tithe to the designated place of worship—the place the 
DEU.14.24	“Now when the 
DEU.14.25	If so, you may sell the tithe portion of your crops and herds, put the money in a pouch, and go to the place the 
DEU.14.26	When you arrive, you may use the money to buy any kind of food you want—cattle, sheep, goats, wine, or other alcoholic drink. Then feast there in the presence of the 
DEU.14.27	And do not neglect the Levites in your town, for they will receive no allotment of land among you.
DEU.14.28	“At the end of every third year, bring the entire tithe of that year’s harvest and store it in the nearest town. 
DEU.14.29	Give it to the Levites, who will receive no allotment of land among you, as well as to the foreigners living among you, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, so they can eat and be satisfied. Then the 
DEU.15.1	“At the end of every seventh year you must cancel the debts of everyone who owes you money. 
DEU.15.2	This is how it must be done. Everyone must cancel the loans they have made to their fellow Israelites. They must not demand payment from their neighbors or relatives, for the 
DEU.15.3	This release from debt, however, applies only to your fellow Israelites—not to the foreigners living among you.
DEU.15.4	“There should be no poor among you, for the 
DEU.15.5	You will receive this blessing if you are careful to obey all the commands of the 
DEU.15.6	The 
DEU.15.7	“But if there are any poor Israelites in your towns when you arrive in the land the 
DEU.15.8	Instead, be generous and lend them whatever they need. 
DEU.15.9	Do not be mean-spirited and refuse someone a loan because the year for canceling debts is close at hand. If you refuse to make the loan and the needy person cries out to the 
DEU.15.10	Give generously to the poor, not grudgingly, for the 
DEU.15.11	There will always be some in the land who are poor. That is why I am commanding you to share freely with the poor and with other Israelites in need.

DEU.15.13	“When you release a male servant, do not send him away empty-handed. 
DEU.15.14	Give him a generous farewell gift from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress. Share with him some of the bounty with which the

DEU.15.17	In that case, take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door. After that, he will be your servant for life. And do the same for your female servants.
DEU.15.18	“You must not consider it a hardship when you release your servants. Remember that for six years they have given you services worth double the wages of hired workers, and the 
DEU.15.19	“You must set aside for the 
DEU.15.20	Instead, you and your family must eat these animals in the presence of the

DEU.17.5	then the man or woman who has committed such an evil act must be taken to the gates of the town and stoned to death. 
DEU.17.6	But never put a person to death on the testimony of only one witness. There must always be two or three witnesses.

DEU.17.20	This regular reading will prevent him from becoming proud and acting as if he is above his fellow citizens. It will also prevent him from turning away from these commands in the smallest way. And it will ensure that he and his descendants will reign for many generations in Israel.

DEU.20.2	When you prepare for battle, the priest must come forward to speak to the troops. 
DEU.20.3	He will say to them, ‘Listen to me, all you men of Israel! Do not be afraid as you go out to fight your enemies today! Do not lose heart or panic or tremble before them.

DEU.21.4	They must lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and that has a stream running through it. There in the valley they must break the heifer’s neck.

DEU.26.5	“You must then say in the presence of the 
DEU.26.6	When the Egyptians oppressed and humiliated us by making us their slaves, 
DEU.26.7	we cried out to the 
DEU.26.8	So the 
DEU.26.9	He brought us to this place and gave us this land flowing with milk and honey! 
DEU.26.10	And now, O 
DEU.26.11	Afterward you may go and celebrate because of all the good things the 
DEU.26.12	“Every third year you must offer a special tithe of your crops. In this year of the special tithe you must give your tithes to the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows, so that they will have enough to eat in your towns. 
DEU.26.13	Then you must declare in the presence of the 
DEU.26.14	I have not eaten any of it while in mourning; I have not handled it while I was ceremonially unclean; and I have not offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the 
DEU.26.15	Now look down from your holy dwelling place in heaven and bless your people Israel and the land you swore to our ancestors to give us—a land flowing with milk and honey.’

DEU.26.19	And if you do, he will set you high above all the other nations he has made. Then you will receive praise, honor, and renown. You will be a nation that is holy to the 
DEU.27.1	Then Moses and the leaders of Israel gave this charge to the people: “Obey all these commands that I am giving you today. 
DEU.27.2	When you cross the Jordan River and enter the land the 
DEU.27.3	Write this whole body of instruction on them when you cross the river to enter the land the 
DEU.27.4	When you cross the Jordan, set up these stones at Mount Ebal and coat them with plaster, as I am commanding you today.
DEU.27.5	“Then build an altar there to the 
DEU.27.6	Build the altar of uncut stones, and use it to offer burnt offerings to the 
DEU.27.7	Also sacrifice peace offerings on it, and celebrate by feasting there before the 
DEU.27.8	You must clearly write all these instructions on the stones coated with plaster.”
DEU.27.9	Then Moses and the Levitical priests addressed all Israel as follows: “O Israel, be quiet and listen! Today you have become the people of the 
DEU.27.10	So you must obey the 
DEU.27.11	That same day Moses also gave this charge to the people: 
DEU.27.12	“When you cross the Jordan River, the tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin must stand on Mount Gerizim to proclaim a blessing over the people. 
DEU.27.13	And the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali must stand on Mount Ebal to proclaim a curse.
DEU.27.14	“Then the Levites will shout to all the people of Israel:
DEU.27.15	‘Cursed is anyone who carves or casts an idol and secretly sets it up. These idols, the work of craftsmen, are detestable to the

DEU.27.19	‘Cursed is anyone who denies justice to foreigners, orphans, or widows.’
DEU.27.19	And all the people will reply, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.20	‘Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with one of his father’s wives, for he has violated his father.’

DEU.27.21	‘Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with an animal.’
DEU.27.21	And all the people will reply, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.22	‘Cursed is anyone who has sexual intercourse with his sister, whether she is the daughter of his father or his mother.’

DEU.28.33	A foreign nation you have never heard about will eat the crops you worked so hard to grow. You will suffer under constant oppression and harsh treatment.

DEU.28.56	The most tender and delicate woman among you—so delicate she would not so much as touch the ground with her foot—will be selfish toward the husband she loves and toward her own son or daughter. 
DEU.28.57	She will hide from them the afterbirth and the new baby she has borne, so that she herself can secretly eat them. She will have nothing else to eat during the siege and terrible distress that your enemy will inflict on all your towns.
DEU.28.58	“If you refuse to obey all the words of instruction that are written in this book, and if you do not fear the glorious and awesome name of the 
DEU.28.59	then the 
DEU.28.60	He will afflict you with all the diseases of Egypt that you feared so much, and you will have no relief. 
DEU.28.61	The

DEU.28.66	Your life will constantly hang in the balance. You will live night and day in fear, unsure if you will survive. 
DEU.28.67	In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were night!’ And in the evening you will say, ‘If only it were morning!’ For you will be terrified by the awful horrors you see around you. 
DEU.28.68	Then the 
DEU.29.1	These are the terms of the covenant the 
DEU.29.2	Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them, “You have seen with your own eyes everything the 
DEU.29.3	all the great tests of strength, the miraculous signs, and the amazing wonders. 
DEU.29.4	But to this day the 
DEU.29.5	For forty years I led you through the wilderness, yet your clothes and sandals did not wear out. 
DEU.29.6	You ate no bread and drank no wine or other alcoholic drink, but he provided for you so you would know that he is the 
DEU.29.7	“When we came here, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them. 
DEU.29.8	We took their land and gave it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh as their grant of land.
DEU.29.9	“Therefore, obey the terms of this covenant so that you will prosper in everything you do. 
DEU.29.10	All of you—tribal leaders, elders, officers, all the men of Israel—are standing today in the presence of the 
DEU.29.11	Your little ones and your wives are with you, as well as the foreigners living among you who chop your wood and carry your water. 
DEU.29.12	You are standing here today to enter into the covenant of the 
DEU.29.13	By entering into the covenant today, he will establish you as his people and confirm that he is your God, just as he promised you and as he swore to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
DEU.29.14	“But you are not the only ones with whom I am making this covenant with its curses. 
DEU.29.15	I am making this covenant both with you who stand here today in the presence of the 
DEU.29.16	“You remember how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we traveled through the lands of enemy nations as we left. 
DEU.29.17	You have seen their detestable practices and their idols
DEU.29.18	I am making this covenant with you so that no one among you—no man, woman, clan, or tribe—will turn away from the 
DEU.29.19	“Those who hear the warnings of this curse should not congratulate themselves, thinking, ‘I am safe, even though I am following the desires of my own stubborn heart.’ This would lead to utter ruin! 
DEU.29.20	The 
DEU.29.21	The 
DEU.29.22	“Then the generations to come, both your own descendants and the foreigners who come from distant lands, will see the devastation of the land and the diseases the 
DEU.29.23	They will exclaim, ‘The whole land is devastated by sulfur and salt. It is a wasteland with nothing planted and nothing growing, not even a blade of grass. It is like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the 
DEU.29.24	“And all the surrounding nations will ask, ‘Why has the 
DEU.29.25	“And the answer will be, ‘This happened because the people of the land abandoned the covenant that the 
DEU.29.26	Instead, they turned away to serve and worship gods they had not known before, gods that were not from the 
DEU.29.27	That is why the 
DEU.29.28	In great anger and fury the 
DEU.29.29	“The 
DEU.30.1	“In the future, when you experience all these blessings and curses I have listed for you, and when you are living among the nations to which the 
DEU.30.2	If at that time you and your children return to the 
DEU.30.3	then the 
DEU.30.4	Even though you are banished to the ends of the earth,
DEU.30.5	The 
DEU.30.6	“The 
DEU.30.7	The 
DEU.30.8	Then you will again obey the 
DEU.30.9	“The 
DEU.30.10	The 
DEU.30.11	“This command I am giving you today is not too difficult for you, and it is not beyond your reach. 
DEU.30.12	It is not kept in heaven, so distant that you must ask, ‘Who will go up to heaven and bring it down so we can hear it and obey?’ 
DEU.30.13	It is not kept beyond the sea, so far away that you must ask, ‘Who will cross the sea to bring it to us so we can hear it and obey?’ 
DEU.30.14	No, the message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart so that you can obey it.
DEU.30.15	“Now listen! Today I am giving you a choice between life and death, between prosperity and disaster. 
DEU.30.16	For I command you this day to love the 
DEU.30.17	“But if your heart turns away and you refuse to listen, and if you are drawn away to serve and worship other gods, 
DEU.30.18	then I warn you now that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live a long, good life in the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy.
DEU.30.19	“Today I have given you the choice between life and death, between blessings and curses. Now I call on heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Oh, that you would choose life, so that you and your descendants might live! 
DEU.30.20	You can make this choice by loving the 
DEU.31.1	When Moses had finished giving these instructions
DEU.31.2	he said, “I am now 120 years old, and I am no longer able to lead you. The 
DEU.31.3	But the 
DEU.31.4	“The 
DEU.31.5	The 
DEU.31.6	So be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid and do not panic before them. For the 
DEU.31.7	Then Moses called for Joshua, and as all Israel watched, he said to him, “Be strong and courageous! For you will lead these people into the land that the 
DEU.31.8	Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the 
DEU.31.9	So Moses wrote this entire body of instruction in a book and gave it to the priests, who carried the Ark of the 
DEU.31.10	Then Moses gave them this command: “At the end of every seventh year, the Year of Release, during the Festival of Shelters, 
DEU.31.11	you must read this Book of Instruction to all the people of Israel when they assemble before the 
DEU.31.12	Call them all together—men, women, children, and the foreigners living in your towns—so they may hear this Book of Instruction and learn to fear the 
DEU.31.13	Do this so that your children who have not known these instructions will hear them and will learn to fear the 
DEU.31.14	Then the 
DEU.31.15	And the 
DEU.31.16	The 
DEU.31.17	Then my anger will blaze forth against them. I will abandon them, hiding my face from them, and they will be devoured. Terrible trouble will come down on them, and on that day they will say, ‘These disasters have come down on us because God is no longer among us!’ 
DEU.31.18	At that time I will hide my face from them on account of all the evil they commit by worshiping other gods.
DEU.31.19	“So write down the words of this song, and teach it to the people of Israel. Help them learn it, so it may serve as a witness for me against them. 
DEU.31.20	For I will bring them into the land I swore to give their ancestors—a land flowing with milk and honey. There they will become prosperous, eat all the food they want, and become fat. But they will begin to worship other gods; they will despise me and break my covenant. 
DEU.31.21	And when great disasters come down on them, this song will stand as evidence against them, for it will never be forgotten by their descendants. I know the intentions of these people, even now before they have entered the land I swore to give them.”
DEU.31.22	So that very day Moses wrote down the words of the song and taught it to the Israelites.
DEU.31.23	Then the 
DEU.31.24	When Moses had finished writing this entire body of instruction in a book, 
DEU.31.25	he gave this command to the Levites who carried the Ark of the 
DEU.31.26	“Take this Book of Instruction and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant of the 
DEU.31.27	For I know how rebellious and stubborn you are. Even now, while I am still alive and am here with you, you have rebelled against the 
DEU.31.28	“Now summon all the elders and officials of your tribes, so that I can speak to them directly and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
DEU.31.29	I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and will turn from the way I have commanded you to follow. In the days to come, disaster will come down on you, for you will do what is evil in the 
DEU.31.30	So Moses recited this entire song publicly to the assembly of Israel:
DEU.32.1	“Listen, O heavens, and I will speak!
DEU.32.1	Hear, O earth, the words that I say!
DEU.32.2	Let my teaching fall on you like rain;
DEU.32.2	let my speech settle like dew.
DEU.32.2	Let my words fall like rain on tender grass,
DEU.32.2	like gentle showers on young plants.
DEU.32.3	I will proclaim the name of the 
DEU.32.3	how glorious is our God!
DEU.32.4	He is the Rock; his deeds are perfect.
DEU.32.4	Everything he does is just and fair.
DEU.32.4	He is a faithful God who does no wrong;
DEU.32.4	how just and upright he is!
DEU.32.5	“But they have acted corruptly toward him;
DEU.32.5	when they act so perversely,
DEU.32.5	are they really his children?
DEU.32.5	They are a deceitful and twisted generation.
DEU.32.6	Is this the way you repay the 
DEU.32.6	you foolish and senseless people?
DEU.32.6	Isn’t he your Father who created you?
DEU.32.6	Has he not made you and established you?
DEU.32.7	Remember the days of long ago;
DEU.32.7	think about the generations past.
DEU.32.7	Ask your father, and he will inform you.
DEU.32.7	Inquire of your elders, and they will tell you.
DEU.32.8	When the Most High assigned lands to the nations,
DEU.32.8	when he divided up the human race,
DEU.32.8	he established the boundaries of the peoples
DEU.32.8	according to the number in his heavenly court.
DEU.32.9	“For the people of Israel belong to the 
DEU.32.9	Jacob is his special possession.
DEU.32.10	He found them in a desert land,
DEU.32.10	in an empty, howling wasteland.
DEU.32.10	He surrounded them and watched over them;
DEU.32.10	he guarded them as he would guard his own eyes.
DEU.32.11	Like an eagle that rouses her chicks
DEU.32.11	and hovers over her young,
DEU.32.11	so he spread his wings to take them up
DEU.32.11	and carried them safely on his pinions.
DEU.32.12	The 
DEU.32.12	they followed no foreign gods.
DEU.32.13	He let them ride over the highlands
DEU.32.13	and feast on the crops of the fields.
DEU.32.13	He nourished them with honey from the rock
DEU.32.13	and olive oil from the stony ground.
DEU.32.14	He fed them yogurt from the herd
DEU.32.14	and milk from the flock,
DEU.32.14	together with the fat of lambs.
DEU.32.14	He gave them choice rams from Bashan, and goats,
DEU.32.14	together with the choicest wheat.
DEU.32.14	You drank the finest wine,
DEU.32.14	made from the juice of grapes.
DEU.32.15	“But Israel
DEU.32.15	the people grew heavy, plump, and stuffed!
DEU.32.15	Then they abandoned the God who had made them;
DEU.32.15	they made light of the Rock of their salvation.
DEU.32.16	They stirred up his jealousy by worshiping foreign gods;
DEU.32.16	they provoked his fury with detestable deeds.
DEU.32.17	They offered sacrifices to demons, which are not God,
DEU.32.17	to gods they had not known before,
DEU.32.17	to new gods only recently arrived,
DEU.32.17	to gods their ancestors had never feared.
DEU.32.18	You neglected the Rock who had fathered you;
DEU.32.18	you forgot the God who had given you birth.
DEU.32.19	“The 
DEU.32.19	provoked to anger by his own sons and daughters.
DEU.32.20	He said, ‘I will abandon them;
DEU.32.20	then see what becomes of them.
DEU.32.20	For they are a twisted generation,
DEU.32.20	children without integrity.
DEU.32.21	They have roused my jealousy by worshiping things that are not God;
DEU.32.21	they have provoked my anger with their useless idols.
DEU.32.21	Now I will rouse their jealousy through people who are not even a people;
DEU.32.21	I will provoke their anger through the foolish Gentiles.
DEU.32.22	For my anger blazes forth like fire
DEU.32.22	and burns to the depths of the grave.
DEU.32.22	It devours the earth and all its crops
DEU.32.22	and ignites the foundations of the mountains.
DEU.32.23	I will heap disasters upon them
DEU.32.23	and shoot them down with my arrows.
DEU.32.24	I will weaken them with famine,
DEU.32.24	burning fever, and deadly disease.
DEU.32.24	I will send the fangs of wild beasts
DEU.32.24	and poisonous snakes that glide in the dust.
DEU.32.25	Outside, the sword will bring death,
DEU.32.25	and inside, terror will strike
DEU.32.25	both young men and young women,
DEU.32.25	both infants and the aged.
DEU.32.26	I would have annihilated them,
DEU.32.26	wiping out even the memory of them.
DEU.32.27	But I feared the taunt of Israel’s enemy,
DEU.32.27	who might misunderstand and say,
DEU.32.27	“Our own power has triumphed!
DEU.32.27	The 
DEU.32.28	“But Israel is a senseless nation;
DEU.32.28	the people are foolish, without understanding.
DEU.32.29	Oh, that they were wise and could understand this!
DEU.32.29	Oh, that they might know their fate!
DEU.32.30	How could one person chase a thousand of them,
DEU.32.30	and two people put ten thousand to flight,
DEU.32.30	unless their Rock had sold them,
DEU.32.30	unless the 
DEU.32.31	But the rock of our enemies is not like our Rock,
DEU.32.31	as even they recognize.
DEU.32.32	Their vine grows from the vine of Sodom,
DEU.32.32	from the vineyards of Gomorrah.
DEU.32.32	Their grapes are poison,
DEU.32.32	and their clusters are bitter.
DEU.32.33	Their wine is the venom of serpents,
DEU.32.33	the deadly poison of cobras.
DEU.32.34	“The 
DEU.32.34	sealing them away in my treasury?
DEU.32.35	I will take revenge; I will pay them back.
DEU.32.35	In due time their feet will slip.
DEU.32.35	Their day of disaster will arrive,
DEU.32.35	and their destiny will overtake them.’
DEU.32.36	“Indeed, the 
DEU.32.36	and he will change his mind about
DEU.32.36	when he sees their strength is gone
DEU.32.36	and no one is left, slave or free.
DEU.32.37	Then he will ask, ‘Where are their gods,
DEU.32.37	the rocks they fled to for refuge?
DEU.32.38	Where now are those gods,
DEU.32.38	who ate the fat of their sacrifices
DEU.32.38	and drank the wine of their offerings?
DEU.32.38	Let those gods arise and help you!
DEU.32.38	Let them provide you with shelter!
DEU.32.39	Look now; I myself am he!
DEU.32.39	There is no other god but me!
DEU.32.39	I am the one who kills and gives life;
DEU.32.39	I am the one who wounds and heals;
DEU.32.39	no one can be rescued from my powerful hand!
DEU.32.40	Now I raise my hand to heaven
DEU.32.40	and declare, “As surely as I live,
DEU.32.41	when I sharpen my flashing sword
DEU.32.41	and begin to carry out justice,
DEU.32.41	I will take revenge on my enemies
DEU.32.41	and repay those who reject me.
DEU.32.42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood,
DEU.32.42	and my sword will devour flesh—
DEU.32.42	the blood of the slaughtered and the captives,
DEU.32.42	and the heads of the enemy leaders.”’
DEU.32.43	“Rejoice with him, you heavens,
DEU.32.43	and let all of God’s angels worship him.
DEU.32.43	Rejoice with his people, you Gentiles,
DEU.32.43	and let all the angels be strengthened in him.
DEU.32.43	For he will avenge the blood of his children
DEU.32.43	he will take revenge against his enemies.
DEU.32.43	He will repay those who hate him
DEU.32.43	and cleanse his people’s land.”
DEU.32.44	So Moses came with Joshua
DEU.32.45	When Moses had finished reciting all these words to the people of Israel, 
DEU.32.46	he added: “Take to heart all the words of warning I have given you today. Pass them on as a command to your children so they will obey every word of these instructions. 
DEU.32.47	These instructions are not empty words—they are your life! By obeying them you will enjoy a long life in the land you will occupy when you cross the Jordan River.”
DEU.32.48	That same day the 
DEU.32.49	“Go to Moab, to the mountains east of the river,
DEU.32.50	Then you will die there on the mountain. You will join your ancestors, just as Aaron, your brother, died on Mount Hor and joined his ancestors. 
DEU.32.51	For both of you betrayed me with the Israelites at the waters of Meribah at Kadesh
DEU.32.52	So you will see the land from a distance, but you may not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel.”
DEU.33.1	This is the blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave to the people of Israel before his death:
DEU.33.2	“The 
DEU.33.2	and dawned upon us
DEU.33.2	he shone forth from Mount Paran
DEU.33.2	and came from Meribah-kadesh
DEU.33.2	with flaming fire at his right hand.
DEU.33.3	Indeed, he loves his people;
DEU.33.3	all his holy ones are in his hands.
DEU.33.3	They follow in his steps
DEU.33.3	and accept his teaching.
DEU.33.4	Moses gave us the 
DEU.33.4	the special possession of the people of Israel.
DEU.33.5	The 
DEU.33.5	when the leaders of the people assembled,
DEU.33.5	when the tribes of Israel gathered as one.”
DEU.33.6	Moses said this about the tribe of Reuben:
DEU.33.6	“Let the tribe of Reuben live and not die out,
DEU.33.6	though they are few in number.”
DEU.33.7	Moses said this about the tribe of Judah:
DEU.33.7	“O 
DEU.33.7	and bring them together as a people.
DEU.33.7	Give them strength to defend their cause;
DEU.33.7	help them against their enemies!”
DEU.33.8	Moses said this about the tribe of Levi:
DEU.33.8	“O 
DEU.33.8	to your faithful servants the Levites.
DEU.33.8	You put them to the test at Massah
DEU.33.8	and struggled with them at the waters of Meribah.
DEU.33.9	The Levites obeyed your word
DEU.33.9	and guarded your covenant.
DEU.33.9	They were more loyal to you
DEU.33.9	than to their own parents.
DEU.33.9	They ignored their relatives
DEU.33.9	and did not acknowledge their own children.
DEU.33.10	They teach your regulations to Jacob;
DEU.33.10	they give your instructions to Israel.
DEU.33.10	They present incense before you
DEU.33.10	and offer whole burnt offerings on the altar.
DEU.33.11	Bless the ministry of the Levites, O 
DEU.33.11	and accept all the work of their hands.
DEU.33.11	Hit their enemies where it hurts the most;
DEU.33.11	strike down their foes so they never rise again.”
DEU.33.12	Moses said this about the tribe of Benjamin:
DEU.33.12	“The people of Benjamin are loved by the 
DEU.33.12	and live in safety beside him.
DEU.33.12	He surrounds them continuously
DEU.33.12	and preserves them from every harm.”
DEU.33.13	Moses said this about the tribes of Joseph:
DEU.33.13	“May their land be blessed by the 
DEU.33.13	with the precious gift of dew from the heavens
DEU.33.13	and water from beneath the earth;
DEU.33.14	with the rich fruit that grows in the sun,
DEU.33.14	and the rich harvest produced each month;
DEU.33.15	with the finest crops of the ancient mountains,
DEU.33.15	and the abundance from the everlasting hills;
DEU.33.16	with the best gifts of the earth and its bounty,
DEU.33.16	and the favor of the one who appeared in the burning bush.
DEU.33.16	May these blessings rest on Joseph’s head,
DEU.33.16	crowning the brow of the prince among his brothers.
DEU.33.17	Joseph has the majesty of a young bull;
DEU.33.17	he has the horns of a wild ox.
DEU.33.17	He will gore distant nations,
DEU.33.17	even to the ends of the earth.
DEU.33.17	This is my blessing for the multitudes of Ephraim
DEU.33.17	and the thousands of Manasseh.”
DEU.33.18	Moses said this about the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar
DEU.33.18	“May the people of Zebulun prosper in their travels.
DEU.33.18	May the people of Issachar prosper at home in their tents.
DEU.33.19	They summon the people to the mountain
DEU.33.19	to offer proper sacrifices there.
DEU.33.19	They benefit from the riches of the sea
DEU.33.19	and the hidden treasures in the sand.”
DEU.33.20	Moses said this about the tribe of Gad:
DEU.33.20	“Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad’s territory!
DEU.33.20	Gad is poised there like a lion
DEU.33.20	to tear off an arm or a head.
DEU.33.21	The people of Gad took the best land for themselves;
DEU.33.21	a leader’s share was assigned to them.
DEU.33.21	When the leaders of the people were assembled,
DEU.33.21	they carried out the 
DEU.33.21	and obeyed his regulations for Israel.”
DEU.33.22	Moses said this about the tribe of Dan:
DEU.33.22	“Dan is a lion’s cub,
DEU.33.22	leaping out from Bashan.”
DEU.33.23	Moses said this about the tribe of Naphtali:
DEU.33.23	“O Naphtali, you are rich in favor
DEU.33.23	and full of the 
DEU.33.23	may you possess the west and the south.”
DEU.33.24	Moses said this about the tribe of Asher:
DEU.33.24	“May Asher be blessed above other sons;
DEU.33.24	may he be esteemed by his brothers;
DEU.33.24	may he bathe his feet in olive oil.
DEU.33.25	May the bolts of your gates be of iron and bronze;
DEU.33.25	may you be secure all your days.”
DEU.33.26	“There is no one like the God of Israel.
DEU.33.26	He rides across the heavens to help you,
DEU.33.26	across the skies in majestic splendor.
DEU.33.27	The eternal God is your refuge,
DEU.33.27	and his everlasting arms are under you.
DEU.33.27	He drives out the enemy before you;
DEU.33.27	he cries out, ‘Destroy them!’
DEU.33.28	So Israel will live in safety,
DEU.33.28	prosperous Jacob in security,
DEU.33.28	in a land of grain and new wine,
DEU.33.28	while the heavens drop down dew.
DEU.33.29	How blessed you are, O Israel!
DEU.33.29	Who else is like you, a people saved by the 
DEU.33.29	He is your protecting shield
DEU.33.29	and your triumphant sword!
DEU.33.29	Your enemies will cringe before you,
DEU.33.29	and you will stomp on their backs!”
DEU.34.1	Then Moses went up to Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab and climbed Pisgah Peak, which is across from Jericho. And the 
DEU.34.2	all the land of Naphtali; the land of Ephraim and Manasseh; all the land of Judah, extending to the Mediterranean Sea
DEU.34.3	the Negev; the Jordan Valley with Jericho—the city of palms—as far as Zoar. 
DEU.34.4	Then the 
DEU.34.5	So Moses, the servant of the 
DEU.34.6	The 
DEU.34.7	Moses was 120 years old when he died, yet his eyesight was clear, and he was as strong as ever. 
DEU.34.8	The people of Israel mourned for Moses on the plains of Moab for thirty days, until the customary period of mourning was over.
DEU.34.9	Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. So the people of Israel obeyed him, doing just as the 
DEU.34.10	There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the 
DEU.34.11	The 
DEU.34.12	With mighty power, Moses performed terrifying acts in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	After the death of Moses the 
JOS.1.2	“Moses my servant is dead. Therefore, the time has come for you to lead these people, the Israelites, across the Jordan River into the land I am giving them. 
JOS.1.3	I promise you what I promised Moses: ‘Wherever you set foot, you will be on land I have given you—
JOS.1.4	from the Negev wilderness in the south to the Lebanon mountains in the north, from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea
JOS.1.5	No one will be able to stand against you as long as you live. For I will be with you as I was with Moses. I will not fail you or abandon you.
JOS.1.6	“Be strong and courageous, for you are the one who will lead these people to possess all the land I swore to their ancestors I would give them. 
JOS.1.7	Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the instructions Moses gave you. Do not deviate from them, turning either to the right or to the left. Then you will be successful in everything you do. 
JOS.1.8	Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do. 
JOS.1.9	This is my command—be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the 
JOS.1.10	Joshua then commanded the officers of Israel, 
JOS.1.11	“Go through the camp and tell the people to get their provisions ready. In three days you will cross the Jordan River and take possession of the land the 
JOS.1.12	Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. He told them, 
JOS.1.13	“Remember what Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, children, and livestock may remain here in the land Moses assigned to you on the east side of the Jordan River. But your strong warriors, fully armed, must lead the other tribes across the Jordan to help them conquer their territory. Stay with them 
JOS.1.15	until the 
JOS.1.16	They answered Joshua, “We will do whatever you command us, and we will go wherever you send us. 
JOS.1.17	We will obey you just as we obeyed Moses. And may the 
JOS.1.18	Anyone who rebels against your orders and does not obey your words and everything you command will be put to death. So be strong and courageous!”
JOS.2.1	Then Joshua secretly sent out two spies from the Israelite camp at Acacia Grove.
JOS.2.2	But someone told the king of Jericho, “Some Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.” 
JOS.2.3	So the king of Jericho sent orders to Rahab: “Bring out the men who have come into your house, for they have come here to spy out the whole land.”
JOS.2.4	Rahab had hidden the two men, but she replied, “Yes, the men were here earlier, but I didn’t know where they were from. 
JOS.2.5	They left the town at dusk, as the gates were about to close. I don’t know where they went. If you hurry, you can probably catch up with them.” 
JOS.2.6	(Actually, she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them beneath bundles of flax she had laid out.) 
JOS.2.7	So the king’s men went looking for the spies along the road leading to the shallow crossings of the Jordan River. And as soon as the king’s men had left, the gate of Jericho was shut.
JOS.2.8	Before the spies went to sleep that night, Rahab went up on the roof to talk with them. 
JOS.2.9	“I know the 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	No wonder our hearts have melted in fear! No one has the courage to fight after hearing such things. For the 
JOS.2.12	“Now swear to me by the 
JOS.2.13	when Jericho is conquered, you will let me live, along with my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all their families.”
JOS.2.14	“We offer our own lives as a guarantee for your safety,” the men agreed. “If you don’t betray us, we will keep our promise and be kind to you when the 
JOS.2.15	Then, since Rahab’s house was built into the town wall, she let them down by a rope through the window. 
JOS.2.16	“Escape to the hill country,” she told them. “Hide there for three days from the men searching for you. Then, when they have returned, you can go on your way.”
JOS.2.17	Before they left, the men told her, “We will be bound by the oath we have taken only if you follow these instructions. 
JOS.2.18	When we come into the land, you must leave this scarlet rope hanging from the window through which you let us down. And all your family members—your father, mother, brothers, and all your relatives—must be here inside the house. 
JOS.2.19	If they go out into the street and are killed, it will not be our fault. But if anyone lays a hand on people inside this house, we will accept the responsibility for their death. 
JOS.2.20	If you betray us, however, we are not bound by this oath in any way.”
JOS.2.21	“I accept your terms,” she replied. And she sent them on their way, leaving the scarlet rope hanging from the window.
JOS.2.22	The spies went up into the hill country and stayed there three days. The men who were chasing them searched everywhere along the road, but they finally returned without success.
JOS.2.23	Then the two spies came down from the hill country, crossed the Jordan River, and reported to Joshua all that had happened to them. 
JOS.2.24	“The 
JOS.3.1	Early the next morning Joshua and all the Israelites left Acacia Grove
JOS.3.2	Three days later the Israelite officers went through the camp, 
JOS.3.3	giving these instructions to the people: “When you see the Levitical priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the 
JOS.3.4	Since you have never traveled this way before, they will guide you. Stay about half a mile
JOS.3.5	Then Joshua told the people, “Purify yourselves, for tomorrow the 
JOS.3.6	In the morning Joshua said to the priests, “Lift up the Ark of the Covenant and lead the people across the river.” And so they started out and went ahead of the people.
JOS.3.7	The 
JOS.3.8	Give this command to the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant: ‘When you reach the banks of the Jordan River, take a few steps into the river and stop there.’”
JOS.3.9	So Joshua told the Israelites, “Come and listen to what the 
JOS.3.10	Today you will know that the living God is among you. He will surely drive out the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites ahead of you. 
JOS.3.11	Look, the Ark of the Covenant, which belongs to the Lord of the whole earth, will lead you across the Jordan River! 
JOS.3.12	Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. 
JOS.3.13	The priests will carry the Ark of the 
JOS.3.14	So the people left their camp to cross the Jordan, and the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant went ahead of them. 
JOS.3.15	It was the harvest season, and the Jordan was overflowing its banks. But as soon as the feet of the priests who were carrying the Ark touched the water at the river’s edge, 
JOS.3.16	the water above that point began backing up a great distance away at a town called Adam, which is near Zarethan. And the water below that point flowed on to the Dead Sea
JOS.3.17	Meanwhile, the priests who were carrying the Ark of the 
JOS.4.1	When all the people had crossed the Jordan, the 
JOS.4.2	“Now choose twelve men, one from each tribe. 
JOS.4.3	Tell them, ‘Take twelve stones from the very place where the priests are standing in the middle of the Jordan. Carry them out and pile them up at the place where you will camp tonight.’”
JOS.4.4	So Joshua called together the twelve men he had chosen—one from each of the tribes of Israel. 
JOS.4.5	He told them, “Go into the middle of the Jordan, in front of the Ark of the 
JOS.4.6	We will use these stones to build a memorial. In the future your children will ask you, ‘What do these stones mean?’ 
JOS.4.7	Then you can tell them, ‘They remind us that the Jordan River stopped flowing when the Ark of the 
JOS.4.8	So the men did as Joshua had commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River, one for each tribe, just as the 
JOS.4.9	Joshua also set up another pile of twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, at the place where the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant were standing. And they are there to this day.
JOS.4.10	The priests who were carrying the Ark stood in the middle of the river until all of the 
JOS.4.11	And when everyone was safely on the other side, the priests crossed over with the Ark of the 
JOS.4.12	The armed warriors from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh led the Israelites across the Jordan, just as Moses had directed. 
JOS.4.13	These armed men—about 40,000 strong—were ready for battle, and the 
JOS.4.14	That day the 
JOS.4.15	The 
JOS.4.16	“Command the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant
JOS.4.17	So Joshua gave the command. 
JOS.4.18	As soon as the priests carrying the Ark of the 
JOS.4.19	The people crossed the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month.
JOS.4.20	It was there at Gilgal that Joshua piled up the twelve stones taken from the Jordan River.
JOS.4.21	Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “In the future your children will ask, ‘What do these stones mean?’ 
JOS.4.22	Then you can tell them, ‘This is where the Israelites crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’ 
JOS.4.23	For the 
JOS.4.24	He did this so all the nations of the earth might know that the 
JOS.5.1	When all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings who lived along the Mediterranean coast
JOS.5.2	At that time the 
JOS.5.3	So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the entire male population of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
JOS.5.4	Joshua had to circumcise them because all the men who were old enough to fight in battle when they left Egypt had died in the wilderness. 
JOS.5.5	Those who left Egypt had all been circumcised, but none of those born after the Exodus, during the years in the wilderness, had been circumcised. 
JOS.5.6	The Israelites had traveled in the wilderness for forty years until all the men who were old enough to fight in battle when they left Egypt had died. For they had disobeyed the 
JOS.5.7	So Joshua circumcised their sons—those who had grown up to take their fathers’ places—for they had not been circumcised on the way to the Promised Land. 
JOS.5.8	After all the males had been circumcised, they rested in the camp until they were healed.
JOS.5.9	Then the 
JOS.5.10	While the Israelites were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they celebrated Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month.
JOS.5.11	The very next day they began to eat unleavened bread and roasted grain harvested from the land. 
JOS.5.12	No manna appeared on the day they first ate from the crops of the land, and it was never seen again. So from that time on the Israelites ate from the crops of Canaan.
JOS.5.13	When Joshua was near the town of Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with sword in hand. Joshua went up to him and demanded, “Are you friend or foe?”
JOS.5.14	“Neither one,” he replied. “I am the commander of the 
JOS.5.14	At this, Joshua fell with his face to the ground in reverence. “I am at your command,” Joshua said. “What do you want your servant to do?”
JOS.5.15	The commander of the 
JOS.6.1	Now the gates of Jericho were tightly shut because the people were afraid of the Israelites. No one was allowed to go out or in. 
JOS.6.2	But the 
JOS.6.3	You and your fighting men should march around the town once a day for six days. 
JOS.6.4	Seven priests will walk ahead of the Ark, each carrying a ram’s horn. On the seventh day you are to march around the town seven times, with the priests blowing the horns. 
JOS.6.5	When you hear the priests give one long blast on the rams’ horns, have all the people shout as loud as they can. Then the walls of the town will collapse, and the people can charge straight into the town.”
JOS.6.6	So Joshua called together the priests and said, “Take up the Ark of the 
JOS.6.7	Then he gave orders to the people: “March around the town, and the armed men will lead the way in front of the Ark of the 
JOS.6.8	After Joshua spoke to the people, the seven priests with the rams’ horns started marching in the presence of the 
JOS.6.9	Some of the armed men marched in front of the priests with the horns and some behind the Ark, with the priests continually blowing the horns. 
JOS.6.10	“Do not shout; do not even talk,” Joshua commanded. “Not a single word from any of you until I tell you to shout. Then shout!” 
JOS.6.11	So the Ark of the 
JOS.6.12	Joshua got up early the next morning, and the priests again carried the Ark of the 
JOS.6.13	The seven priests with the rams’ horns marched in front of the Ark of the 
JOS.6.14	On the second day they again marched around the town once and returned to the camp. They followed this pattern for six days.
JOS.6.15	On the seventh day the Israelites got up at dawn and marched around the town as they had done before. But this time they went around the town seven times. 
JOS.6.16	The seventh time around, as the priests sounded the long blast on their horns, Joshua commanded the people, “Shout! For the 
JOS.6.17	Jericho and everything in it must be completely destroyed
JOS.6.18	“Do not take any of the things set apart for destruction, or you yourselves will be completely destroyed, and you will bring trouble on the camp of Israel. 
JOS.6.19	Everything made from silver, gold, bronze, or iron is sacred to the 
JOS.6.20	When the people heard the sound of the rams’ horns, they shouted as loud as they could. Suddenly, the walls of Jericho collapsed, and the Israelites charged straight into the town and captured it. 
JOS.6.21	They completely destroyed everything in it with their swords—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, goats, and donkeys.
JOS.6.22	Meanwhile, Joshua said to the two spies, “Keep your promise. Go to the prostitute’s house and bring her out, along with all her family.”
JOS.6.23	The men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, and all the other relatives who were with her. They moved her whole family to a safe place near the camp of Israel.
JOS.6.24	Then the Israelites burned the town and everything in it. Only the things made from silver, gold, bronze, or iron were kept for the treasury of the 
JOS.6.25	So Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute and her relatives who were with her in the house, because she had hidden the spies Joshua sent to Jericho. And she lives among the Israelites to this day.
JOS.6.26	At that time Joshua invoked this curse:
JOS.6.26	“May the curse of the 
JOS.6.26	who tries to rebuild the town of Jericho.
JOS.6.26	At the cost of his firstborn son,
JOS.6.26	he will lay its foundation.
JOS.6.26	At the cost of his youngest son,
JOS.6.26	he will set up its gates.”
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	But Israel violated the instructions about the things set apart for the 
JOS.7.2	Joshua sent some of his men from Jericho to spy out the town of Ai, east of Bethel, near Beth-aven. 
JOS.7.3	When they returned, they told Joshua, “There’s no need for all of us to go up there; it won’t take more than two or three thousand men to attack Ai. Since there are so few of them, don’t make all our people struggle to go up there.”
JOS.7.4	So approximately 3,000 warriors were sent, but they were soundly defeated. The men of Ai 
JOS.7.5	chased the Israelites from the town gate as far as the quarries,
JOS.7.6	Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothing in dismay, threw dust on their heads, and bowed face down to the ground before the Ark of the 
JOS.7.7	Then Joshua cried out, “Oh, Sovereign 
JOS.7.8	Lord, what can I say now that Israel has fled from its enemies? 
JOS.7.9	For when the Canaanites and all the other people living in the land hear about it, they will surround us and wipe our name off the face of the earth. And then what will happen to the honor of your great name?”
JOS.7.10	But the 
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned and broken my covenant! They have stolen some of the things that I commanded must be set apart for me. And they have not only stolen them but have lied about it and hidden the things among their own belongings. 
JOS.7.12	That is why the Israelites are running from their enemies in defeat. For now Israel itself has been set apart for destruction. I will not remain with you any longer unless you destroy the things among you that were set apart for destruction.
JOS.7.13	“Get up! Command the people to purify themselves in preparation for tomorrow. For this is what the 
JOS.7.14	“In the morning you must present yourselves by tribes, and the 
JOS.7.15	The one who has stolen what was set apart for destruction will himself be burned with fire, along with everything he has, for he has broken the covenant of the 
JOS.7.16	Early the next morning Joshua brought the tribes of Israel before the 
JOS.7.17	Then the clans of Judah came forward, and the clan of Zerah was singled out. Then the families of Zerah came forward, and the family of Zimri was singled out. 
JOS.7.18	Every member of Zimri’s family was brought forward person by person, and Achan was singled out.
JOS.7.19	Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the 
JOS.7.20	Achan replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	Among the plunder I saw a beautiful robe from Babylon,
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent some men to make a search. They ran to the tent and found the stolen goods hidden there, just as Achan had said, with the silver buried beneath the rest. 
JOS.7.23	They took the things from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites. Then they laid them on the ground in the presence of the 
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua and all the Israelites took Achan, the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons, daughters, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, tent, and everything he had, and they brought them to the valley of Achor. 
JOS.7.25	Then Joshua said to Achan, “Why have you brought trouble on us? The 
JOS.7.26	They piled a great heap of stones over Achan, which remains to this day. That is why the place has been called the Valley of Trouble
JOS.8.1	Then the 
JOS.8.2	You will destroy them as you destroyed Jericho and its king. But this time you may keep the plunder and the livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the town.”
JOS.8.3	So Joshua and all the fighting men set out to attack Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 of his best warriors and sent them out at night 
JOS.8.4	with these orders: “Hide in ambush close behind the town and be ready for action. 
JOS.8.5	When our main army attacks, the men of Ai will come out to fight as they did before, and we will run away from them. 
JOS.8.6	We will let them chase us until we have drawn them away from the town. For they will say, ‘The Israelites are running away from us as they did before.’ Then, while we are running from them, 
JOS.8.7	you will jump up from your ambush and take possession of the town, for the 
JOS.8.8	Set the town on fire, as the 
JOS.8.9	So they left and went to the place of ambush between Bethel and the west side of Ai. But Joshua remained among the people in the camp that night. 
JOS.8.10	Early the next morning Joshua roused his men and started toward Ai, accompanied by the elders of Israel. 
JOS.8.11	All the fighting men who were with Joshua marched in front of the town and camped on the north side of Ai, with a valley between them and the town. 
JOS.8.12	That night Joshua sent about 5,000 men to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the town. 
JOS.8.13	So they stationed the main army north of the town and the ambush west of the town. Joshua himself spent that night in the valley.
JOS.8.14	When the king of Ai saw the Israelites across the valley, he and all his army hurried out early in the morning and attacked the Israelites at a place overlooking the Jordan Valley.
JOS.8.15	Joshua and the Israelite army fled toward the wilderness as though they were badly beaten. 
JOS.8.16	Then all the men in the town were called out to chase after them. In this way, they were lured away from the town. 
JOS.8.17	There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel
JOS.8.18	Then the 
JOS.8.19	As soon as Joshua gave this signal, all the men in ambush jumped up from their position and poured into the town. They quickly captured it and set it on fire.
JOS.8.20	When the men of Ai looked behind them, smoke from the town was filling the sky, and they had nowhere to go. For the Israelites who had fled in the direction of the wilderness now turned on their pursuers. 
JOS.8.21	When Joshua and all the other Israelites saw that the ambush had succeeded and that smoke was rising from the town, they turned and attacked the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	Meanwhile, the Israelites who were inside the town came out and attacked the enemy from the rear. So the men of Ai were caught in the middle, with Israelite fighters on both sides. Israel attacked them, and not a single person survived or escaped. 
JOS.8.23	Only the king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	When the Israelite army finished chasing and killing all the men of Ai in the open fields, they went back and finished off everyone inside. 
JOS.8.25	So the entire population of Ai, including men and women, was wiped out that day—12,000 in all. 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua kept holding out his spear until everyone who had lived in Ai was completely destroyed.
JOS.8.27	Only the livestock and the treasures of the town were not destroyed, for the Israelites kept these as plunder for themselves, as the 
JOS.8.28	So Joshua burned the town of Ai,
JOS.8.29	Joshua impaled the king of Ai on a sharpened pole and left him there until evening. At sunset the Israelites took down the body, as Joshua commanded, and threw it in front of the town gate. They piled a great heap of stones over him that can still be seen today.
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built an altar to the 
JOS.8.31	He followed the commands that Moses the 
JOS.8.32	And as the Israelites watched, Joshua copied onto the stones of the altar
JOS.8.33	Then all the Israelites—foreigners and native-born alike—along with the elders, officers, and judges, were divided into two groups. One group stood in front of Mount Gerizim, the other in front of Mount Ebal. Each group faced the other, and between them stood the Levitical priests carrying the Ark of the 
JOS.8.34	Joshua then read to them all the blessings and curses Moses had written in the Book of Instruction. 
JOS.8.35	Every word of every command that Moses had ever given was read to the entire assembly of Israel, including the women and children and the foreigners who lived among them.
JOS.9.1	Now all the kings west of the Jordan River heard about what had happened. These were the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who lived in the hill country, in the western foothills,
JOS.9.2	These kings combined their armies to fight as one against Joshua and the Israelites.
JOS.9.3	But when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
JOS.9.4	they resorted to deception to save themselves. They sent ambassadors to Joshua, loading their donkeys with weathered saddlebags and old, patched wineskins. 
JOS.9.5	They put on worn-out, patched sandals and ragged clothes. And the bread they took with them was dry and moldy. 
JOS.9.6	When they arrived at the camp of Israel at Gilgal, they told Joshua and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant land to ask you to make a peace treaty with us.”
JOS.9.7	The Israelites replied to these Hivites, “How do we know you don’t live nearby? For if you do, we cannot make a treaty with you.”
JOS.9.8	They replied, “We are your servants.”
JOS.9.8	“But who are you?” Joshua demanded. “Where do you come from?”
JOS.9.9	They answered, “Your servants have come from a very distant country. We have heard of the might of the 
JOS.9.10	We have also heard what he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River—King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan (who lived in Ashtaroth). 
JOS.9.11	So our elders and all our people instructed us, ‘Take supplies for a long journey. Go meet with the people of Israel and tell them, “We are your servants; please make a treaty with us.”’
JOS.9.12	“This bread was hot from the ovens when we left our homes. But now, as you can see, it is dry and moldy. 
JOS.9.13	These wineskins were new when we filled them, but now they are old and split open. And our clothing and sandals are worn out from our very long journey.”
JOS.9.14	So the Israelites examined their food, but they did not consult the 
JOS.9.15	Then Joshua made a peace treaty with them and guaranteed their safety, and the leaders of the community ratified their agreement with a binding oath.
JOS.9.16	Three days after making the treaty, they learned that these people actually lived nearby! 
JOS.9.17	The Israelites set out at once to investigate and reached their towns in three days. The names of these towns were Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. 
JOS.9.18	But the Israelites did not attack the towns, for the Israelite leaders had made a vow to them in the name of the 
JOS.9.18	The people of Israel grumbled against their leaders because of the treaty. 
JOS.9.19	But the leaders replied, “Since we have sworn an oath in the presence of the 
JOS.9.20	This is what we must do. We must let them live, for divine anger would come upon us if we broke our oath. 
JOS.9.21	Let them live.” So they made them woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community, as the Israelite leaders directed.
JOS.9.22	Joshua called together the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you lie to us? Why did you say that you live in a distant land when you live right here among us? 
JOS.9.23	May you be cursed! From now on you will always be servants who cut wood and carry water for the house of my God.”
JOS.9.24	They replied, “We did it because we—your servants—were clearly told that the 
JOS.9.25	Now we are at your mercy—do to us whatever you think is right.”
JOS.9.26	So Joshua did not allow the people of Israel to kill them. 
JOS.9.27	But that day he made the Gibeonites the woodcutters and water carriers for the community of Israel and for the altar of the 
JOS.10.1	Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured and completely destroyed
JOS.10.2	He and his people became very afraid when they heard all this because Gibeon was a large town—as large as the royal cities and larger than Ai. And the Gibeonite men were strong warriors.
JOS.10.3	So King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent messengers to several other kings: Hoham of Hebron, Piram of Jarmuth, Japhia of Lachish, and Debir of Eglon. 
JOS.10.4	“Come and help me destroy Gibeon,” he urged them, “for they have made peace with Joshua and the people of Israel.” 
JOS.10.5	So these five Amorite kings combined their armies for a united attack. They moved all their troops into place and attacked Gibeon.
JOS.10.6	The men of Gibeon quickly sent messengers to Joshua at his camp in Gilgal. “Don’t abandon your servants now!” they pleaded. “Come at once! Save us! Help us! For all the Amorite kings who live in the hill country have joined forces to attack us.”
JOS.10.7	So Joshua and his entire army, including his best warriors, left Gilgal and set out for Gibeon. 
JOS.10.8	“Do not be afraid of them,” the 
JOS.10.9	Joshua traveled all night from Gilgal and took the Amorite armies by surprise. 
JOS.10.10	The 
JOS.10.11	As the Amorites retreated down the road from Beth-horon, the 
JOS.10.12	On the day the 
JOS.10.12	“Let the sun stand still over Gibeon,
JOS.10.12	and the moon over the valley of Aijalon.”
JOS.10.13	So the sun stood still and the moon stayed in place until the nation of Israel had defeated its enemies.
JOS.10.13	Is this event not recorded in 
JOS.10.14	There has never been a day like this one before or since, when the 
JOS.10.15	Then Joshua and the Israelite army returned to their camp at Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	During the battle the five kings escaped and hid in a cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	When Joshua heard that they had been found, 
JOS.10.18	he issued this command: “Cover the opening of the cave with large rocks, and place guards at the entrance to keep the kings inside. 
JOS.10.19	The rest of you continue chasing the enemy and cut them down from the rear. Don’t give them a chance to get back to their towns, for the 
JOS.10.20	So Joshua and the Israelite army continued the slaughter and completely crushed the enemy. They totally wiped out the five armies except for a tiny remnant that managed to reach their fortified towns. 
JOS.10.21	Then the Israelites returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. After that, no one dared to speak even a word against Israel.
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, “Remove the rocks covering the opening of the cave, and bring the five kings to me.” 
JOS.10.23	So they brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	When they brought them out, Joshua told the commanders of his army, “Come and put your feet on the kings’ necks.” And they did as they were told.
JOS.10.25	“Don’t ever be afraid or discouraged,” Joshua told his men. “Be strong and courageous, for the 
JOS.10.26	Then Joshua killed each of the five kings and impaled them on five sharpened poles, where they hung until evening.
JOS.10.27	As the sun was going down, Joshua gave instructions for the bodies of the kings to be taken down from the poles and thrown into the cave where they had been hiding. Then they covered the opening of the cave with a pile of large rocks, which remains to this very day.
JOS.10.28	That same day Joshua captured and destroyed the town of Makkedah. He killed everyone in it, including the king, leaving no survivors. He destroyed them all, and he killed the king of Makkedah as he had killed the king of Jericho. 
JOS.10.29	Then Joshua and the Israelites went to Libnah and attacked it. 
JOS.10.30	There, too, the 
JOS.10.31	From Libnah, Joshua and the Israelites went to Lachish and attacked it. 
JOS.10.32	Here again, the 
JOS.10.33	During the attack on Lachish, King Horam of Gezer arrived with his army to help defend the town. But Joshua’s men killed him and his army, leaving no survivors.
JOS.10.34	Then Joshua and the Israelite army went on to Eglon and attacked it. 
JOS.10.35	They captured it that day and killed everyone in it. He completely destroyed everyone, just as he had done at Lachish. 
JOS.10.36	From Eglon, Joshua and the Israelite army went up to Hebron and attacked it. 
JOS.10.37	They captured the town and killed everyone in it, including its king, leaving no survivors. They did the same thing to all of its surrounding villages. And just as he had done at Eglon, he completely destroyed the entire population.
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua and the Israelites turned back and attacked Debir. 
JOS.10.39	He captured the town, its king, and all of its surrounding villages. He completely destroyed everyone in it, leaving no survivors. He did to Debir and its king just what he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king.
JOS.10.40	So Joshua conquered the whole region—the kings and people of the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills,
JOS.10.41	Joshua slaughtered them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza and from the region around the town of Goshen up to Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	Joshua conquered all these kings and their land in a single campaign, for the 
JOS.10.43	Then Joshua and the Israelite army returned to their camp at Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	When King Jabin of Hazor heard what had happened, he sent messages to the following kings: King Jobab of Madon; the king of Shimron; the king of Acshaph; 
JOS.11.2	all the kings of the northern hill country; the kings in the Jordan Valley south of Galilee
JOS.11.3	the kings of Canaan, both east and west; the kings of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites in the towns on the slopes of Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
JOS.11.4	All these kings came out to fight. Their combined armies formed a vast horde. And with all their horses and chariots, they covered the landscape like the sand on the seashore. 
JOS.11.5	The kings joined forces and established their camp around the water near Merom to fight against Israel.
JOS.11.6	Then the 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua and all his fighting men traveled to the water near Merom and attacked suddenly. 
JOS.11.8	And the 
JOS.11.9	Then Joshua crippled the horses and burned all the chariots, as the 
JOS.11.10	Joshua then turned back and captured Hazor and killed its king. (Hazor had at one time been the capital of all these kingdoms.) 
JOS.11.11	The Israelites completely destroyed
JOS.11.12	Joshua slaughtered all the other kings and their people, completely destroying them, just as Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.11.13	But the Israelites did not burn any of the towns built on mounds except Hazor, which Joshua burned. 
JOS.11.14	And the Israelites took all the plunder and livestock of the ravaged towns for themselves. But they killed all the people, leaving no survivors. 
JOS.11.15	As the 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua conquered the entire region—the hill country, the entire Negev, the whole area around the town of Goshen, the western foothills, the Jordan Valley,
JOS.11.17	The Israelite territory now extended all the way from Mount Halak, which leads up to Seir in the south, as far north as Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon in the valley of Lebanon. Joshua killed all the kings of those territories, 
JOS.11.18	waging war for a long time to accomplish this. 
JOS.11.19	No one in this region made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites of Gibeon. All the others were defeated. 
JOS.11.20	For the 
JOS.11.21	During this period Joshua destroyed all the descendants of Anak, who lived in the hill country of Hebron, Debir, Anab, and the entire hill country of Judah and Israel. He killed them all and completely destroyed their towns. 
JOS.11.22	None of the descendants of Anak were left in all the land of Israel, though some still remained in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took control of the entire land, just as the 
JOS.12.1	These are the kings east of the Jordan River who had been killed by the Israelites and whose land was taken. Their territory extended from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon and included all the land east of the Jordan Valley.
JOS.12.2	King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, was defeated. His kingdom included Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon Gorge, and extended from the middle of the Arnon Gorge to the Jabbok River, which serves as a border for the Ammonites. This territory included the southern half of the territory of Gilead. 
JOS.12.3	Sihon also controlled the Jordan Valley and regions to the east—from as far north as the Sea of Galilee to as far south as the Dead Sea,
JOS.12.4	King Og of Bashan, the last of the Rephaites, lived at Ashtaroth and Edrei. 
JOS.12.5	He ruled a territory stretching from Mount Hermon to Salecah in the north and to all of Bashan in the east, and westward to the borders of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah. This territory included the northern half of Gilead, as far as the boundary of King Sihon of Heshbon.
JOS.12.6	Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.12.7	The following is a list of the kings that Joshua and the Israelite armies defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which leads up to Seir. (Joshua gave this land to the tribes of Israel as their possession, 
JOS.12.8	including the hill country, the western foothills,
JOS.12.9	The king of Jericho
JOS.12.9	The king of Ai, near Bethel
JOS.12.10	The king of Jerusalem
JOS.12.10	The king of Hebron
JOS.12.11	The king of Jarmuth
JOS.12.11	The king of Lachish
JOS.12.12	The king of Eglon
JOS.12.12	The king of Gezer
JOS.12.13	The king of Debir
JOS.12.13	The king of Geder
JOS.12.14	The king of Hormah
JOS.12.14	The king of Arad
JOS.12.15	The king of Libnah
JOS.12.15	The king of Adullam
JOS.12.16	The king of Makkedah
JOS.12.16	The king of Bethel
JOS.12.17	The king of Tappuah
JOS.12.17	The king of Hepher
JOS.12.18	The king of Aphek
JOS.12.18	The king of Lasharon
JOS.12.19	The king of Madon
JOS.12.19	The king of Hazor
JOS.12.20	The king of Shimron-meron
JOS.12.20	The king of Acshaph
JOS.12.21	The king of Taanach
JOS.12.21	The king of Megiddo
JOS.12.22	The king of Kedesh
JOS.12.22	The king of Jokneam in Carmel
JOS.12.23	The king of Dor in the town of Naphoth-dor
JOS.12.23	The king of Goyim in Gilgal
JOS.12.24	The king of Tirzah.
JOS.12.24	In all, thirty-one kings were defeated.
JOS.13.1	When Joshua was an old man, the 
JOS.13.2	This is the territory that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and the Geshurites, 
JOS.13.3	and the larger territory of the Canaanites, extending from the stream of Shihor on the border of Egypt, northward to the boundary of Ekron. It includes the territory of the five Philistine rulers of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. The land of the Avvites 
JOS.13.4	in the south also remains to be conquered. In the north, the following area has not yet been conquered: all the land of the Canaanites, including Mearah (which belongs to the Sidonians), stretching northward to Aphek on the border of the Amorites; 
JOS.13.5	the land of the Gebalites and all of the Lebanon mountain area to the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath; 
JOS.13.6	and all the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, including all the land of the Sidonians.
JOS.13.6	“I myself will drive these people out of the land ahead of the Israelites. So be sure to give this land to Israel as a special possession, just as I have commanded you. 
JOS.13.7	Include all this territory as Israel’s possession when you divide this land among the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”
JOS.13.8	Half the tribe of Manasseh and the tribes of Reuben and Gad had already received their grants of land on the east side of the Jordan, for Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.13.9	Their territory extended from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge (including the town in the middle of the gorge) to the plain beyond Medeba, as far as Dibon. 
JOS.13.10	It also included all the towns of King Sihon of the Amorites, who had reigned in Heshbon, and extended as far as the borders of Ammon. 
JOS.13.11	It included Gilead, the territory of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah, all of Mount Hermon, all of Bashan as far as Salecah, 
JOS.13.12	and all the territory of King Og of Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. King Og was the last of the Rephaites, for Moses had attacked them and driven them out. 
JOS.13.13	But the Israelites failed to drive out the people of Geshur and Maacah, so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day.
JOS.13.14	Moses did not assign any allotment of land to the tribe of Levi. Instead, as the 
JOS.13.15	Moses had assigned the following area to the clans of the tribe of Reuben.
JOS.13.16	Their territory extended from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge (including the town in the middle of the gorge) to the plain beyond Medeba. 
JOS.13.17	It included Heshbon and the other towns on the plain—Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon, 
JOS.13.18	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill above the valley, 
JOS.13.20	Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth.
JOS.13.21	The land of Reuben also included all the towns of the plain and the entire kingdom of Sihon. Sihon was the Amorite king who had reigned in Heshbon and was killed by Moses along with the leaders of Midian—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—princes living in the region who were allied with Sihon. 
JOS.13.22	The Israelites had also killed Balaam son of Beor, who used magic to tell the future. 
JOS.13.23	The Jordan River marked the western boundary for the tribe of Reuben. The towns and their surrounding villages in this area were given as a homeland to the clans of the tribe of Reuben.
JOS.13.24	Moses had assigned the following area to the clans of the tribe of Gad.
JOS.13.25	Their territory included Jazer, all the towns of Gilead, and half of the land of Ammon, as far as the town of Aroer just west of
JOS.13.26	It extended from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Lo-debar.
JOS.13.27	In the valley were Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, Zaphon, and the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon. The western boundary ran along the Jordan River, extended as far north as the tip of the Sea of Galilee,
JOS.13.28	The towns and their surrounding villages in this area were given as a homeland to the clans of the tribe of Gad.
JOS.13.29	Moses had assigned the following area to the clans of the half-tribe of Manasseh.
JOS.13.30	Their territory extended from Mahanaim, including all of Bashan, all the former kingdom of King Og, and the sixty towns of Jair in Bashan. 
JOS.13.31	It also included half of Gilead and King Og’s royal cities of Ashtaroth and Edrei. All this was given to the clans of the descendants of Makir, who was Manasseh’s son.
JOS.13.32	These are the allotments Moses had made while he was on the plains of Moab, across the Jordan River, east of Jericho. 
JOS.13.33	But Moses gave no allotment of land to the tribe of Levi, for the 
JOS.14.1	The remaining tribes of Israel received land in Canaan as allotted by Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the tribal leaders. 
JOS.14.2	These nine and a half tribes received their grants of land by means of sacred lots, in accordance with the 
JOS.14.3	Moses had already given a grant of land to the two and a half tribes on the east side of the Jordan River, but he had given the Levites no such allotment. 
JOS.14.4	The descendants of Joseph had become two separate tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim. And the Levites were given no land at all, only towns to live in with surrounding pasturelands for their livestock and all their possessions. 
JOS.14.5	So the land was distributed in strict accordance with the 
JOS.14.6	A delegation from the tribe of Judah, led by Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, came to Joshua at Gilgal. Caleb said to Joshua, “Remember what the 
JOS.14.7	I was forty years old when Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.14.8	but my brothers who went with me frightened the people from entering the Promised Land. For my part, I wholeheartedly followed the 
JOS.14.9	So that day Moses solemnly promised me, ‘The land of Canaan on which you were just walking will be your grant of land and that of your descendants forever, because you wholeheartedly followed the 
JOS.14.10	“Now, as you can see, the 
JOS.14.11	I am as strong now as I was when Moses sent me on that journey, and I can still travel and fight as well as I could then. 
JOS.14.12	So give me the hill country that the 
JOS.14.13	So Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave Hebron to him as his portion of land. 
JOS.14.14	Hebron still belongs to the descendants of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite because he wholeheartedly followed the 
JOS.14.15	(Previously Hebron had been called Kiriath-arba. It had been named after Arba, a great hero of the descendants of Anak.)
JOS.14.15	And the land had rest from war.
JOS.15.1	The allotment for the clans of the tribe of Judah reached southward to the border of Edom, as far south as the wilderness of Zin.
JOS.15.2	The southern boundary began at the south bay of the Dead Sea,
JOS.15.3	ran south of Scorpion Pass
JOS.15.4	From there it passed to Azmon until it finally reached the Brook of Egypt, which it followed to the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.5	The eastern boundary extended along the Dead Sea to the mouth of the Jordan River.
JOS.15.5	The northern boundary began at the bay where the Jordan River empties into the Dead Sea, 
JOS.15.6	went up from there to Beth-hoglah, then proceeded north of Beth-arabah to the Stone of Bohan. (Bohan was Reuben’s son.) 
JOS.15.7	From that point it went through the valley of Achor to Debir, turning north toward Gilgal, which is across from the slopes of Adummim on the south side of the valley. From there the boundary extended to the springs at En-shemesh and on to En-rogel. 
JOS.15.8	The boundary then passed through the valley of Ben-Hinnom, along the southern slopes of the Jebusites, where the city of Jerusalem is located. Then it went west to the top of the mountain above the valley of Hinnom, and on up to the northern end of the valley of Rephaim. 
JOS.15.9	From there the boundary extended from the top of the mountain to the spring at the waters of Nephtoah,
JOS.15.10	The boundary circled west of Baalah to Mount Seir, passed along to the town of Kesalon on the northern slope of Mount Jearim, and went down to Beth-shemesh and on to Timnah. 
JOS.15.11	The boundary then proceeded to the slope of the hill north of Ekron, where it turned toward Shikkeron and Mount Baalah. It passed Jabneel and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.12	The western boundary was the shoreline of the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.12	These are the boundaries for the clans of the tribe of Judah.
JOS.15.13	The 
JOS.15.14	Caleb drove out the three groups of Anakites—the descendants of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the sons of Anak.
JOS.15.15	From there he went to fight against the people living in the town of Debir (formerly called Kiriath-sepher). 
JOS.15.16	Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the one who attacks and captures Kiriath-sepher.” 
JOS.15.17	Othniel, the son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz, was the one who conquered it, so Acsah became Othniel’s wife.
JOS.15.18	When Acsah married Othniel, she urged him
JOS.15.19	She said, “Give me another gift. You have already given me land in the Negev; now please give me springs of water, too.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
JOS.15.20	This was the homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Judah.
JOS.15.21	The towns of Judah situated along the borders of Edom in the extreme south were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 
JOS.15.22	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 
JOS.15.23	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, 
JOS.15.24	Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, 
JOS.15.25	Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor), 
JOS.15.26	Amam, Shema, Moladah, 
JOS.15.27	Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet, 
JOS.15.28	Hazar-shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah, 
JOS.15.29	Baalah, Iim, Ezem, 
JOS.15.30	Eltolad, Kesil, Hormah, 
JOS.15.31	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 
JOS.15.32	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon—twenty-nine towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.15.33	The following towns situated in the western foothills
JOS.15.34	Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam, 
JOS.15.35	Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah, 
JOS.15.36	Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim—fourteen towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.15.37	Also included were Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad, 
JOS.15.38	Dilean, Mizpeh, Joktheel, 
JOS.15.39	Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, 
JOS.15.40	Cabbon, Lahmam, Kitlish, 
JOS.15.41	Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah—sixteen towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.15.42	Besides these, there were Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 
JOS.15.43	Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 
JOS.15.44	Keilah, Aczib, and Mareshah—nine towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.15.45	The territory of the tribe of Judah also included Ekron and its surrounding settlements and villages. 
JOS.15.46	From Ekron the boundary extended west and included the towns near Ashdod with their surrounding villages. 
JOS.15.47	It also included Ashdod with its surrounding settlements and villages and Gaza with its settlements and villages, as far as the Brook of Egypt and along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.48	Judah also received the following towns in the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, 
JOS.15.49	Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir), 
JOS.15.50	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, 
JOS.15.51	Goshen, Holon, and Giloh—eleven towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.15.52	Also included were the towns of Arab, Dumah, Eshan, 
JOS.15.53	Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah, 
JOS.15.54	Humtah, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior—nine towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.15.55	Besides these, there were Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, 
JOS.15.56	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 
JOS.15.57	Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah—ten towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.15.58	In addition, there were Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor, 
JOS.15.59	Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon—six towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.15.60	There were also Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim) and Rabbah—two towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.15.61	In the wilderness there were the towns of Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah, 
JOS.15.62	Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi—six towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.15.63	But the tribe of Judah could not drive out the Jebusites, who lived in the city of Jerusalem, so the Jebusites live there among the people of Judah to this day.
JOS.16.1	The allotment for the descendants of Joseph extended from the Jordan River near Jericho, east of the springs of Jericho, through the wilderness and into the hill country of Bethel. 
JOS.16.2	From Bethel (that is, Luz)
JOS.16.3	Then it descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer and over to the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.16.4	This was the homeland allocated to the families of Joseph’s sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
JOS.16.5	The following territory was given to the clans of the tribe of Ephraim.
JOS.16.5	The boundary of their homeland began at Ataroth-addar in the east. From there it ran to Upper Beth-horon, 
JOS.16.6	then on to the Mediterranean Sea. From Micmethath on the north, the boundary curved eastward past Taanath-shiloh to the east of Janoah. 
JOS.16.7	From Janoah it turned southward to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho, and ended at the Jordan River. 
JOS.16.8	From Tappuah the boundary extended westward, following the Kanah Ravine to the Mediterranean Sea. This is the homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Ephraim.
JOS.16.9	In addition, some towns with their surrounding villages in the territory allocated to the half-tribe of Manasseh were set aside for the tribe of Ephraim. 
JOS.16.10	They did not drive the Canaanites out of Gezer, however, so the people of Gezer live as slaves among the people of Ephraim to this day.
JOS.17.1	The next allotment of land was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the descendants of Joseph’s older son. Makir, the firstborn son of Manasseh, was the father of Gilead. Because his descendants were experienced soldiers, the regions of Gilead and Bashan on the east side of the Jordan had already been given to them. 
JOS.17.2	So the allotment on the west side of the Jordan was for the remaining families within the clans of the tribe of Manasseh: Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These clans represent the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph.
JOS.17.3	However, Zelophehad, a descendant of Hepher son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, had no sons. He had only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
JOS.17.4	These women came to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the Israelite leaders and said, “The 
JOS.17.4	So Joshua gave them a grant of land along with their uncles, as the 
JOS.17.5	As a result, Manasseh’s total allocation came to ten parcels of land, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan across the Jordan River, 
JOS.17.6	because the female descendants of Manasseh received a grant of land along with the male descendants. (The land of Gilead was given to the rest of the male descendants of Manasseh.)
JOS.17.7	The boundary of the tribe of Manasseh extended from the border of Asher to Micmethath, near Shechem. Then the boundary went south from Micmethath to the settlement near the spring of Tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	The land surrounding Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah itself, on the border of Manasseh’s territory, belonged to the tribe of Ephraim. 
JOS.17.9	From the spring of Tappuah, the boundary of Manasseh followed the Kanah Ravine to the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.17.10	In general, however, the land south of the ravine belonged to Ephraim, and the land north of the ravine belonged to Manasseh. Manasseh’s boundary ran along the northern side of the ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. North of Manasseh was the territory of Asher, and to the east was the territory of Issachar.
JOS.17.11	The following towns within the territory of Issachar and Asher, however, were given to Manasseh: Beth-shan,
JOS.17.12	But the descendants of Manasseh were unable to occupy these towns because the Canaanites were determined to stay in that region. 
JOS.17.13	Later, however, when the Israelites became strong enough, they forced the Canaanites to work as slaves. But they did not drive them out of the land.
JOS.17.14	The descendants of Joseph came to Joshua and asked, “Why have you given us only one portion of land as our homeland when the 
JOS.17.15	Joshua replied, “If there are so many of you, and if the hill country of Ephraim is not large enough for you, clear out land for yourselves in the forest where the Perizzites and Rephaites live.”
JOS.17.16	The descendants of Joseph responded, “It’s true that the hill country is not large enough for us. But all the Canaanites in the lowlands have iron chariots, both those in Beth-shan and its surrounding settlements and those in the valley of Jezreel. They are too strong for us.”
JOS.17.17	Then Joshua said to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, the descendants of Joseph, “Since you are so large and strong, you will be given more than one portion. 
JOS.17.18	The forests of the hill country will be yours as well. Clear as much of the land as you wish, and take possession of its farthest corners. And you will drive out the Canaanites from the valleys, too, even though they are strong and have iron chariots.”
JOS.18.1	Now that the land was under Israelite control, the entire community of Israel gathered at Shiloh and set up the Tabernacle.
JOS.18.2	But there remained seven tribes who had not yet been allotted their grants of land.
JOS.18.3	Then Joshua asked them, “How long are you going to wait before taking possession of the remaining land the 
JOS.18.4	Select three men from each tribe, and I will send them out to explore the land and map it out. They will then return to me with a written report of their proposed divisions of their new homeland. 
JOS.18.5	Let them divide the land into seven sections, excluding Judah’s territory in the south and Joseph’s territory in the north. 
JOS.18.6	And when you record the seven divisions of the land and bring them to me, I will cast sacred lots in the presence of the 
JOS.18.7	“The Levites, however, will not receive any allotment of land. Their role as priests of the 
JOS.18.8	As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua commanded them, “Go and explore the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will assign the land to the tribes by casting sacred lots here in the presence of the 
JOS.18.9	The men did as they were told and mapped the entire territory into seven sections, listing the towns in each section. They made a written record and then returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	And there at Shiloh, Joshua cast sacred lots in the presence of the 
JOS.18.11	The first allotment of land went to the clans of the tribe of Benjamin. It lay between the territory assigned to the tribes of Judah and Joseph.
JOS.18.12	The northern boundary of Benjamin’s land began at the Jordan River, went north of the slope of Jericho, then west through the hill country and the wilderness of Beth-aven. 
JOS.18.13	From there the boundary went south to Luz (that is, Bethel) and proceeded down to Ataroth-addar on the hill that lies south of Lower Beth-horon.
JOS.18.14	The boundary then made a turn and swung south along the western edge of the hill facing Beth-horon, ending at the village of Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a town belonging to the tribe of Judah. This was the western boundary.
JOS.18.15	The southern boundary began at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim. From that western point it ran
JOS.18.16	and down to the base of the mountain beside the valley of Ben-Hinnom, at the northern end of the valley of Rephaim. From there it went down the valley of Hinnom, crossing south of the slope where the Jebusites lived, and continued down to En-rogel. 
JOS.18.17	From En-rogel the boundary proceeded in a northerly direction and came to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth (which is across from the slopes of Adummim). Then it went down to the Stone of Bohan. (Bohan was Reuben’s son.) 
JOS.18.18	From there it passed along the north side of the slope overlooking the Jordan Valley.
JOS.18.19	ran past the north slope of Beth-hoglah, and ended at the north bay of the Dead Sea,
JOS.18.20	The eastern boundary was the Jordan River.
JOS.18.20	These were the boundaries of the homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.
JOS.18.21	These were the towns given to the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.
JOS.18.21	Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz, 
JOS.18.22	Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
JOS.18.23	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
JOS.18.24	Kephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba—twelve towns with their surrounding villages. 
JOS.18.25	Also Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 
JOS.18.26	Mizpah, Kephirah, Mozah, 
JOS.18.27	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
JOS.18.28	Zela, Haeleph, the Jebusite town (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath-jearim
JOS.18.28	This was the homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.
JOS.19.1	The second allotment of land went to the clans of the tribe of Simeon. Their homeland was surrounded by Judah’s territory.
JOS.19.2	Simeon’s homeland included Beersheba, Sheba, Moladah, 
JOS.19.3	Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem, 
JOS.19.4	Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
JOS.19.5	Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah, 
JOS.19.6	Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen—thirteen towns with their surrounding villages. 
JOS.19.7	It also included Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan—four towns with their villages, 
JOS.19.8	including all the surrounding villages as far south as Baalath-beer (also known as Ramah of the Negev).
JOS.19.8	This was the homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Simeon. 
JOS.19.9	Their allocation of land came from part of what had been given to Judah because Judah’s territory was too large for them. So the tribe of Simeon received an allocation within the territory of Judah.
JOS.19.10	The third allotment of land went to the clans of the tribe of Zebulun.
JOS.19.10	The boundary of Zebulun’s homeland started at Sarid. 
JOS.19.11	From there it went west, going past Maralah, touching Dabbesheth, and proceeding to the brook east of Jokneam. 
JOS.19.12	In the other direction, the boundary went east from Sarid to the border of Kisloth-tabor, and from there to Daberath and up to Japhia. 
JOS.19.13	Then it continued east to Gath-hepher, Eth-kazin, and Rimmon and turned toward Neah. 
JOS.19.14	The northern boundary of Zebulun passed Hannathon and ended at the valley of Iphtah-el. 
JOS.19.15	The towns in these areas included Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem—twelve towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.19.16	The homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Zebulun included these towns and their surrounding villages.
JOS.19.17	The fourth allotment of land went to the clans of the tribe of Issachar.
JOS.19.18	Its boundaries included the following towns: Jezreel, Kesulloth, Shunem, 
JOS.19.19	Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 
JOS.19.20	Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 
JOS.19.21	Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez. 
JOS.19.22	The boundary also touched Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, ending at the Jordan River—sixteen towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.19.23	The homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Issachar included these towns and their surrounding villages.
JOS.19.24	The fifth allotment of land went to the clans of the tribe of Asher.
JOS.19.25	Its boundaries included these towns: Helkath, Hali, Beten, Acshaph, 
JOS.19.26	Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. The boundary on the west touched Carmel and Shihor-libnath, 
JOS.19.27	then it turned east toward Beth-dagon, and ran as far as Zebulun in the valley of Iphtah-el, going north to Beth-emek and Neiel. It then continued north to Cabul, 
JOS.19.28	Abdon,
JOS.19.29	Then the boundary turned toward Ramah and the fortress of Tyre, where it turned toward Hosah and came to the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.19.30	Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob—twenty-two towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.19.31	The homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Asher included these towns and their surrounding villages.
JOS.19.32	The sixth allotment of land went to the clans of the tribe of Naphtali.
JOS.19.33	Its boundary ran from Heleph, from the oak at Zaanannim, and extended across to Adami-nekeb, Jabneel, and as far as Lakkum, ending at the Jordan River. 
JOS.19.34	The western boundary ran past Aznoth-tabor, then to Hukkok, and touched the border of Zebulun in the south, the border of Asher on the west, and the Jordan River
JOS.19.35	The fortified towns included in this territory were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth, 
JOS.19.36	Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
JOS.19.37	Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor, 
JOS.19.38	Yiron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh—nineteen towns with their surrounding villages.
JOS.19.39	The homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Naphtali included these towns and their surrounding villages.
JOS.19.40	The seventh allotment of land went to the clans of the tribe of Dan.
JOS.19.41	The land allocated as their homeland included the following towns: Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh, 
JOS.19.42	Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 
JOS.19.43	Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
JOS.19.44	Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
JOS.19.45	Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon, 
JOS.19.46	Me-jarkon, Rakkon, and the territory across from Joppa.
JOS.19.47	But the tribe of Dan had trouble taking possession of their land,
JOS.19.48	The homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Dan included these towns and their surrounding villages.
JOS.19.49	After all the land was divided among the tribes, the Israelites gave a piece of land to Joshua as his allocation. 
JOS.19.50	For the 
JOS.19.51	These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the tribal leaders allocated as grants of land to the tribes of Israel by casting sacred lots in the presence of the 
JOS.20.1	The 
JOS.20.2	“Now tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed Moses. 
JOS.20.3	Anyone who kills another person accidentally and unintentionally can run to one of these cities; they will be places of refuge from relatives seeking revenge for the person who was killed.
JOS.20.4	“Upon reaching one of these cities, the one who caused the death will appear before the elders at the city gate and present his case. They must allow him to enter the city and give him a place to live among them. 
JOS.20.5	If the relatives of the victim come to avenge the killing, the leaders must not release the slayer to them, for he killed the other person unintentionally and without previous hostility. 
JOS.20.6	But the slayer must stay in that city and be tried by the local assembly, which will render a judgment. And he must continue to live in that city until the death of the high priest who was in office at the time of the accident. After that, he is free to return to his own home in the town from which he fled.”
JOS.20.7	The following cities were designated as cities of refuge: Kedesh of Galilee, in the hill country of Naphtali; Shechem, in the hill country of Ephraim; and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah. 
JOS.20.8	On the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho, the following cities were designated: Bezer, in the wilderness plain of the tribe of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead, in the territory of the tribe of Gad; and Golan in Bashan, in the land of the tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.20.9	These cities were set apart for all the Israelites as well as the foreigners living among them. Anyone who accidentally killed another person could take refuge in one of these cities. In this way, they could escape being killed in revenge prior to standing trial before the local assembly.
JOS.21.1	Then the leaders of the tribe of Levi came to consult with Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the other tribes of Israel. 
JOS.21.2	They came to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and said, “The 
JOS.21.3	So by the command of the 
JOS.21.4	The descendants of Aaron, who were members of the Kohathite clan within the tribe of Levi, were allotted thirteen towns that were originally assigned to the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. 
JOS.21.5	The other families of the Kohathite clan were allotted ten towns from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
JOS.21.6	The clan of Gershon was allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
JOS.21.7	The clan of Merari was allotted twelve towns from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
JOS.21.8	So the Israelites obeyed the 
JOS.21.9	The Israelites gave the following towns from the tribes of Judah and Simeon 
JOS.21.10	to the descendants of Aaron, who were members of the Kohathite clan within the tribe of Levi, since the sacred lot fell to them first: 
JOS.21.11	Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah, along with its surrounding pasturelands. (Arba was an ancestor of Anak.) 
JOS.21.12	But the open fields beyond the town and the surrounding villages were given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
JOS.21.13	The following towns with their pasturelands were given to the descendants of Aaron the priest: Hebron (a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone), Libnah, 
JOS.21.14	Jattir, Eshtemoa, 
JOS.21.15	Holon, Debir, 
JOS.21.16	Ain, Juttah, and Beth-shemesh—nine towns from these two tribes.
JOS.21.17	From the tribe of Benjamin the priests were given the following towns with their pasturelands: Gibeon, Geba, 
JOS.21.18	Anathoth, and Almon—four towns. 
JOS.21.19	So in all, thirteen towns with their pasturelands were given to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
JOS.21.20	The rest of the Kohathite clan from the tribe of Levi was allotted the following towns and pasturelands from the tribe of Ephraim: 
JOS.21.21	Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim (a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone), Gezer, 
JOS.21.22	Kibzaim, and Beth-horon—four towns.
JOS.21.23	The following towns and pasturelands were allotted to the priests from the tribe of Dan: Eltekeh, Gibbethon, 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon, and Gath-rimmon—four towns.
JOS.21.25	The half-tribe of Manasseh allotted the following towns with their pasturelands to the priests: Taanach and Gath-rimmon—two towns. 
JOS.21.26	So in all, ten towns with their pasturelands were given to the rest of the Kohathite clan.
JOS.21.27	The descendants of Gershon, another clan within the tribe of Levi, received the following towns with their pasturelands from the half-tribe of Manasseh: Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone) and Be-eshterah—two towns.
JOS.21.28	From the tribe of Issachar they received the following towns with their pasturelands: Kishion, Daberath, 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth, and En-gannim—four towns.
JOS.21.30	From the tribe of Asher they received the following towns with their pasturelands: Mishal, Abdon, 
JOS.21.31	Helkath, and Rehob—four towns.
JOS.21.32	From the tribe of Naphtali they received the following towns with their pasturelands: Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone), Hammoth-dor, and Kartan—three towns. 
JOS.21.33	So in all, thirteen towns with their pasturelands were allotted to the clan of Gershon.
JOS.21.34	The rest of the Levites—the Merari clan—were given the following towns with their pasturelands from the tribe of Zebulun: Jokneam, Kartah, 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah, and Nahalal—four towns.
JOS.21.36	From the tribe of Reuben they received the following towns with their pasturelands: Bezer, Jahaz,
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth, and Mephaath—four towns.
JOS.21.38	From the tribe of Gad they received the following towns with their pasturelands: Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone), Mahanaim, 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon, and Jazer—four towns. 
JOS.21.40	So in all, twelve towns were allotted to the clan of Merari.
JOS.21.41	The total number of towns and pasturelands within Israelite territory given to the Levites came to forty-eight. 
JOS.21.42	Every one of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it.
JOS.21.43	So the 
JOS.21.44	And the 
JOS.21.45	Not a single one of all the good promises the 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.22.2	He told them, “You have done as Moses, the servant of the 
JOS.22.3	During all this time you have not deserted the other tribes. You have been careful to obey the commands of the 
JOS.22.4	And now the 
JOS.22.5	But be very careful to obey all the commands and the instructions that Moses gave to you. Love the 
JOS.22.6	So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went home.
JOS.22.7	Moses had given the land of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The other half of the tribe was given land west of the Jordan.) As Joshua sent them away and blessed them, 
JOS.22.8	he said to them, “Go back to your homes with the great wealth you have taken from your enemies—the vast herds of livestock, the silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and the large supply of clothing. Share the plunder with your relatives.”
JOS.22.9	So the men of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the rest of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan. They started the journey back to their own land of Gilead, the territory that belonged to them according to the 
JOS.22.10	But while they were still in Canaan, and when they came to a place called Geliloth
JOS.22.11	The rest of Israel heard that the people of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar at Geliloth at the edge of the land of Canaan, on the west side of the Jordan River. 
JOS.22.12	So the whole community of Israel gathered at Shiloh and prepared to go to war against them. 
JOS.22.13	First, however, they sent a delegation led by Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to talk with the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.22.14	In this delegation were ten leaders of Israel, one from each of the ten tribes, and each the head of his family within the clans of Israel.
JOS.22.15	When they arrived in the land of Gilead, they said to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.22.16	“The whole community of the 
JOS.22.17	Was our sin at Peor not enough? To this day we are not fully cleansed of it, even after the plague that struck the entire community of the 
JOS.22.18	And yet today you are turning away from following the 
JOS.22.19	“If you need the altar because the land you possess is defiled, then join us in the 
JOS.22.20	Didn’t divine anger fall on the entire community of Israel when Achan, a member of the clan of Zerah, sinned by stealing the things set apart for the 
JOS.22.21	Then the people of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the heads of the clans of Israel: 
JOS.22.22	“The 
JOS.22.23	If we have built an altar for ourselves to turn away from the 
JOS.22.24	“The truth is, we have built this altar because we fear that in the future your descendants will say to ours, ‘What right do you have to worship the 
JOS.22.25	The 
JOS.22.26	“So we decided to build the altar, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, 
JOS.22.27	but as a memorial. It will remind our descendants and your descendants that we, too, have the right to worship the 
JOS.22.28	“If they say this, our descendants can reply, ‘Look at this copy of the 
JOS.22.29	Far be it from us to rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community—the heads of the clans of Israel—heard this from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, they were satisfied. 
JOS.22.31	Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, replied to them, “Today we know the 
JOS.22.32	Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the other leaders left the tribes of Reuben and Gad in Gilead and returned to the land of Canaan to tell the Israelites what had happened. 
JOS.22.33	And all the Israelites were satisfied and praised God and spoke no more of war against Reuben and Gad.
JOS.22.34	The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar “Witness,”
JOS.23.1	The years passed, and the 
JOS.23.2	called together all the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel. He said to them, “I am now a very old man. 
JOS.23.3	You have seen everything the 
JOS.23.4	I have allotted to you as your homeland all the land of the nations yet unconquered, as well as the land of those we have already conquered—from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea
JOS.23.5	This land will be yours, for the 
JOS.23.6	“So be very careful to follow everything Moses wrote in the Book of Instruction. Do not deviate from it, turning either to the right or to the left. 
JOS.23.7	Make sure you do not associate with the other people still remaining in the land. Do not even mention the names of their gods, much less swear by them or serve them or worship them. 
JOS.23.8	Rather, cling tightly to the 
JOS.23.9	“For the 
JOS.23.10	Each one of you will put to flight a thousand of the enemy, for the 
JOS.23.11	So be very careful to love the 
JOS.23.12	“But if you turn away from him and cling to the customs of the survivors of these nations remaining among you, and if you intermarry with them, 
JOS.23.13	then know for certain that the 
JOS.23.14	“Soon I will die, going the way of everything on earth. Deep in your hearts you know that every promise of the 
JOS.23.15	But as surely as the 
JOS.23.16	If you break the covenant of the 
JOS.24.1	Then Joshua summoned all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, including their elders, leaders, judges, and officers. So they came and presented themselves to God.
JOS.24.2	Joshua said to the people, “This is what the 
JOS.24.3	But I took your ancestor Abraham from the land beyond the Euphrates and led him into the land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants through his son Isaac. 
JOS.24.4	To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir, while Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
JOS.24.5	“Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I brought terrible plagues on Egypt; and afterward I brought you out as a free people. 
JOS.24.6	But when your ancestors arrived at the Red Sea,
JOS.24.7	When your ancestors cried out to the 
JOS.24.8	“Finally, I brought you into the land of the Amorites on the east side of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I destroyed them before you. I gave you victory over them, and you took possession of their land. 
JOS.24.9	Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, started a war against Israel. He summoned Balaam son of Beor to curse you, 
JOS.24.10	but I would not listen to him. Instead, I made Balaam bless you, and so I rescued you from Balak.
JOS.24.11	“When you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho, the men of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I gave you victory over them. 
JOS.24.12	And I sent terror
JOS.24.13	I gave you land you had not worked on, and I gave you towns you did not build—the towns where you are now living. I gave you vineyards and olive groves for food, though you did not plant them.
JOS.24.14	“So fear the 
JOS.24.15	But if you refuse to serve the 
JOS.24.16	The people replied, “We would never abandon the 
JOS.24.17	For the 
JOS.24.18	It was the 
JOS.24.19	Then Joshua warned the people, “You are not able to serve the 
JOS.24.20	If you abandon the 
JOS.24.21	But the people answered Joshua, “No, we will serve the 
JOS.24.22	“You are a witness to your own decision,” Joshua said. “You have chosen to serve the 
JOS.24.22	“Yes,” they replied, “we are witnesses to what we have said.”
JOS.24.23	“All right then,” Joshua said, “destroy the idols among you, and turn your hearts to the 
JOS.24.24	The people said to Joshua, “We will serve the 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day at Shechem, committing them to follow the decrees and regulations of the 
JOS.24.26	Joshua recorded these things in the Book of God’s Instructions. As a reminder of their agreement, he took a huge stone and rolled it beneath the terebinth tree beside the Tabernacle of the 
JOS.24.27	Joshua said to all the people, “This stone has heard everything the 
JOS.24.28	Then Joshua sent all the people away to their own homelands.
JOS.24.29	After this, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the 
JOS.24.30	They buried him in the land he had been allocated, at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
JOS.24.31	The people of Israel served the 
JOS.24.32	The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought along with them when they left Egypt, were buried at Shechem, in the plot of land Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor for 100 pieces of silver.
JOS.24.33	Eleazar son of Aaron also died. He was buried in the hill country of Ephraim, in the town of Gibeah, which had been given to his son Phinehas.
JDG.1.1	After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the 
JDG.1.2	The 
JDG.1.3	The men of Judah said to their relatives from the tribe of Simeon, “Join with us to fight against the Canaanites living in the territory allotted to us. Then we will help you conquer your territory.” So the men of Simeon went with Judah.
JDG.1.4	When the men of Judah attacked, the 
JDG.1.5	While at Bezek they encountered King Adoni-bezek and fought against him, and the Canaanites and Perizzites were defeated. 
JDG.1.6	Adoni-bezek escaped, but the Israelites soon captured him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
JDG.1.7	Adoni-bezek said, “I once had seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off, eating scraps from under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them.” They took him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
JDG.1.8	The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it, killing all its people and setting the city on fire. 
JDG.1.9	Then they went down to fight the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev, and the western foothills.
JDG.1.10	Judah marched against the Canaanites in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath-arba), defeating the forces of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
JDG.1.11	From there they went to fight against the people living in the town of Debir (formerly called Kiriath-sepher). 
JDG.1.12	Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the one who attacks and captures Kiriath-sepher.” 
JDG.1.13	Othniel, the son of Caleb’s younger brother, Kenaz, was the one who conquered it, so Acsah became Othniel’s wife.
JDG.1.14	When Acsah married Othniel, she urged him
JDG.1.15	She said, “Let me have another gift. You have already given me land in the Negev; now please give me springs of water, too.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
JDG.1.16	When the tribe of Judah left Jericho—the city of palms—the Kenites, who were descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, traveled with them into the wilderness of Judah. They settled among the people there, near the town of Arad in the Negev.
JDG.1.17	Then Judah joined with Simeon to fight against the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they completely destroyed
JDG.1.18	In addition, Judah captured the towns of Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, along with their surrounding territories.
JDG.1.19	The 
JDG.1.20	The town of Hebron was given to Caleb as Moses had promised. And Caleb drove out the people living there, who were descendants of the three sons of Anak.
JDG.1.21	The tribe of Benjamin, however, failed to drive out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites live in Jerusalem among the people of Benjamin.
JDG.1.22	The descendants of Joseph attacked the town of Bethel, and the 
JDG.1.23	They sent men to scout out Bethel (formerly known as Luz). 
JDG.1.24	They confronted a man coming out of the town and said to him, “Show us a way into the town, and we will have mercy on you.” 
JDG.1.25	So he showed them a way in, and they killed everyone in the town except that man and his family. 
JDG.1.26	Later the man moved to the land of the Hittites, where he built a town. He named it Luz, which is its name to this day.
JDG.1.27	The tribe of Manasseh failed to drive out the people living in Beth-shan,
JDG.1.28	When the Israelites grew stronger, they forced the Canaanites to work as slaves, but they never did drive them completely out of the land.
JDG.1.29	The tribe of Ephraim failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, so the Canaanites continued to live there among them.
JDG.1.30	The tribe of Zebulun failed to drive out the residents of Kitron and Nahalol, so the Canaanites continued to live among them. But the Canaanites were forced to work as slaves for the people of Zebulun.
JDG.1.31	The tribe of Asher failed to drive out the residents of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob. 
JDG.1.32	Instead, the people of Asher moved in among the Canaanites, who controlled the land, for they failed to drive them out.
JDG.1.33	Likewise, the tribe of Naphtali failed to drive out the residents of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath. Instead, they moved in among the Canaanites, who controlled the land. Nevertheless, the people of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were forced to work as slaves for the people of Naphtali.
JDG.1.34	As for the tribe of Dan, the Amorites forced them back into the hill country and would not let them come down into the plains. 
JDG.1.35	The Amorites were determined to stay in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim, but when the descendants of Joseph became stronger, they forced the Amorites to work as slaves. 
JDG.1.36	The boundary of the Amorites ran from Scorpion Pass
JDG.2.1	The angel of the 
JDG.2.2	For your part, you were not to make any covenants with the people living in this land; instead, you were to destroy their altars. But you disobeyed my command. Why did you do this? 
JDG.2.3	So now I declare that I will no longer drive out the people living in your land. They will be thorns in your sides,
JDG.2.4	When the angel of the 
JDG.2.5	So they called the place Bokim (which means “weeping”), and they offered sacrifices there to the 
JDG.2.6	After Joshua sent the people away, each of the tribes left to take possession of the land allotted to them. 
JDG.2.7	And the Israelites served the 
JDG.2.8	Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the 
JDG.2.9	They buried him in the land he had been allocated, at Timnath-serah
JDG.2.10	After that generation died, another generation grew up who did not acknowledge the 
JDG.2.11	The Israelites did evil in the 
JDG.2.12	They abandoned the 
JDG.2.13	They abandoned the 
JDG.2.14	This made the 
JDG.2.15	Every time Israel went out to battle, the 
JDG.2.16	Then the 
JDG.2.17	Yet Israel did not listen to the judges but prostituted themselves by worshiping other gods. How quickly they turned away from the path of their ancestors, who had walked in obedience to the 
JDG.2.18	Whenever the 
JDG.2.19	But when the judge died, the people returned to their corrupt ways, behaving worse than those who had lived before them. They went after other gods, serving and worshiping them. And they refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
JDG.2.20	So the 
JDG.2.21	I will no longer drive out the nations that Joshua left unconquered when he died. 
JDG.2.22	I did this to test Israel—to see whether or not they would follow the ways of the 
JDG.2.23	That is why the 
JDG.3.1	These are the nations that the 
JDG.3.2	He did this to teach warfare to generations of Israelites who had no experience in battle. 
JDG.3.3	These are the nations: the Philistines (those living under the five Philistine rulers), all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath. 
JDG.3.4	These people were left to test the Israelites—to see whether they would obey the commands the 
JDG.3.5	So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, 
JDG.3.6	and they intermarried with them. Israelite sons married their daughters, and Israelite daughters were given in marriage to their sons. And the Israelites served their gods.
JDG.3.7	The Israelites did evil in the 
JDG.3.8	Then the 
JDG.3.9	But when the people of Israel cried out to the 
JDG.3.10	The Spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	So there was peace in the land for forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	Once again the Israelites did evil in the 
JDG.3.13	Eglon enlisted the Ammonites and Amalekites as allies, and then he went out and defeated Israel, taking possession of Jericho, the city of palms. 
JDG.3.14	And the Israelites served Eglon of Moab for eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	But when the people of Israel cried out to the 
JDG.3.16	So Ehud made a double-edged dagger that was about a foot
JDG.3.17	He brought the tribute money to Eglon, who was very fat.
JDG.3.18	After delivering the payment, Ehud started home with those who had helped carry the tribute. 
JDG.3.19	But when Ehud reached the stone idols near Gilgal, he turned back. He came to Eglon and said, “I have a secret message for you.”
JDG.3.19	So the king commanded his servants, “Be quiet!” and he sent them all out of the room.
JDG.3.20	Ehud walked over to Eglon, who was sitting alone in a cool upstairs room. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you!” As King Eglon rose from his seat, 
JDG.3.21	Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled out the dagger strapped to his right thigh, and plunged it into the king’s belly. 
JDG.3.22	The dagger went so deep that the handle disappeared beneath the king’s fat. So Ehud did not pull out the dagger, and the king’s bowels emptied.
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud closed and locked the doors of the room and escaped down the latrine.
JDG.3.24	After Ehud was gone, the king’s servants returned and found the doors to the upstairs room locked. They thought he might be using the latrine in the room, 
JDG.3.25	so they waited. But when the king didn’t come out after a long delay, they became concerned and got a key. And when they opened the doors, they found their master dead on the floor.
JDG.3.26	While the servants were waiting, Ehud escaped, passing the stone idols on his way to Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	When he arrived in the hill country of Ephraim, Ehud sounded a call to arms. Then he led a band of Israelites down from the hills.
JDG.3.28	“Follow me,” he said, “for the 
JDG.3.29	They attacked the Moabites and killed about 10,000 of their strongest and most able-bodied warriors. Not one of them escaped. 
JDG.3.30	So Moab was conquered by Israel that day, and there was peace in the land for eighty years.
JDG.3.31	After Ehud, Shamgar son of Anath rescued Israel. He once killed 600 Philistines with an ox goad.
JDG.4.1	After Ehud’s death, the Israelites again did evil in the 
JDG.4.2	So the 
JDG.4.3	Sisera, who had 900 iron chariots, ruthlessly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years. Then the people of Israel cried out to the 
JDG.4.4	Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet who was judging Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	She would sit under the Palm of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites would go to her for judgment. 
JDG.4.6	One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam, who lived in Kedesh in the land of Naphtali. She said to him, “This is what the 
JDG.4.7	And I will call out Sisera, commander of Jabin’s army, along with his chariots and warriors, to the Kishon River. There I will give you victory over him.”
JDG.4.8	Barak told her, “I will go, but only if you go with me.”
JDG.4.9	“Very well,” she replied, “I will go with you. But you will receive no honor in this venture, for the 
JDG.4.10	At Kedesh, Barak called together the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali, and 10,000 warriors went up with him. Deborah also went with him.
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite, a descendant of Moses’ brother-in-law
JDG.4.12	When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor, 
JDG.4.13	he called for all 900 of his iron chariots and all of his warriors, and they marched from Harosheth-haggoyim to the Kishon River.
JDG.4.14	Then Deborah said to Barak, “Get ready! This is the day the 
JDG.4.15	When Barak attacked, the 
JDG.4.16	Then Barak chased the chariots and the enemy army all the way to Harosheth-haggoyim, killing all of Sisera’s warriors. Not a single one was left alive.
JDG.4.17	Meanwhile, Sisera ran to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because Heber’s family was on friendly terms with King Jabin of Hazor. 
JDG.4.18	Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come into my tent, sir. Come in. Don’t be afraid.” So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
JDG.4.19	“Please give me some water,” he said. “I’m thirsty.” So she gave him some milk from a leather bag and covered him again.
JDG.4.20	“Stand at the door of the tent,” he told her. “If anybody comes and asks you if there is anyone here, say no.”
JDG.4.21	But when Sisera fell asleep from exhaustion, Jael quietly crept up to him with a hammer and tent peg in her hand. Then she drove the tent peg through his temple and into the ground, and so he died.
JDG.4.22	When Barak came looking for Sisera, Jael went out to meet him. She said, “Come, and I will show you the man you are looking for.” So he followed her into the tent and found Sisera lying there dead, with the tent peg through his temple.
JDG.4.23	So on that day Israel saw God defeat Jabin, the Canaanite king. 
JDG.4.24	And from that time on Israel became stronger and stronger against King Jabin until they finally destroyed him.
JDG.5.1	On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:
JDG.5.2	“Israel’s leaders took charge,
JDG.5.2	and the people gladly followed.
JDG.5.2	Praise the 
JDG.5.3	“Listen, you kings!
JDG.5.3	Pay attention, you mighty rulers!
JDG.5.3	For I will sing to the 
JDG.5.3	I will make music to the 
JDG.5.4	“
JDG.5.4	and marched across the fields of Edom,
JDG.5.4	the earth trembled,
JDG.5.4	and the cloudy skies poured down rain.
JDG.5.5	The mountains quaked in the presence of the 
JDG.5.5	the God of Mount Sinai—
JDG.5.5	in the presence of the 
JDG.5.5	the God of Israel.
JDG.5.6	“In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,
JDG.5.6	and in the days of Jael,
JDG.5.6	people avoided the main roads,
JDG.5.6	and travelers stayed on winding pathways.
JDG.5.7	There were few people left in the villages of Israel
JDG.5.7	until Deborah arose as a mother for Israel.
JDG.5.8	When Israel chose new gods,
JDG.5.8	war erupted at the city gates.
JDG.5.8	Yet not a shield or spear could be seen
JDG.5.8	among forty thousand warriors in Israel!
JDG.5.9	My heart is with the commanders of Israel,
JDG.5.9	with those who volunteered for war.
JDG.5.9	Praise the 
JDG.5.10	“Consider this, you who ride on fine donkeys,
JDG.5.10	you who sit on fancy saddle blankets,
JDG.5.10	and you who walk along the road.
JDG.5.11	Listen to the village musicians
JDG.5.11	gathered at the watering holes.
JDG.5.11	They recount the righteous victories of the 
JDG.5.11	and the victories of his villagers in Israel.
JDG.5.11	Then the people of the 
JDG.5.11	marched down to the city gates.
JDG.5.12	“Wake up, Deborah, wake up!
JDG.5.12	Wake up, wake up, and sing a song!
JDG.5.12	Arise, Barak!
JDG.5.12	Lead your captives away, son of Abinoam!
JDG.5.13	“Down from Tabor marched the few against the nobles.
JDG.5.13	The people of the 
JDG.5.14	They came down from Ephraim—
JDG.5.14	a land that once belonged to the Amalekites;
JDG.5.14	they followed you, Benjamin, with your troops.
JDG.5.14	From Makir the commanders marched down;
JDG.5.14	from Zebulun came those who carry a commander’s staff.
JDG.5.15	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah and Barak.
JDG.5.15	They followed Barak, rushing into the valley.
JDG.5.15	But in the tribe of Reuben
JDG.5.15	there was great indecision.
JDG.5.16	Why did you sit at home among the sheepfolds—
JDG.5.16	to hear the shepherds whistle for their flocks?
JDG.5.16	Yes, in the tribe of Reuben
JDG.5.16	there was great indecision.
JDG.5.17	Gilead remained east of the Jordan.
JDG.5.17	And why did Dan stay home?
JDG.5.17	Asher sat unmoved at the seashore,
JDG.5.17	remaining in his harbors.
JDG.5.18	But Zebulun risked his life,
JDG.5.18	as did Naphtali, on the heights of the battlefield.
JDG.5.19	“The kings of Canaan came and fought,
JDG.5.19	at Taanach near Megiddo’s springs,
JDG.5.19	but they carried off no silver treasures.
JDG.5.20	The stars fought from heaven.
JDG.5.20	The stars in their orbits fought against Sisera.
JDG.5.21	The Kishon River swept them away—
JDG.5.21	that ancient torrent, the Kishon.
JDG.5.21	March on with courage, my soul!
JDG.5.22	Then the horses’ hooves hammered the ground,
JDG.5.22	the galloping, galloping of Sisera’s mighty steeds.
JDG.5.23	‘Let the people of Meroz be cursed,’ said the angel of the 
JDG.5.23	‘Let them be utterly cursed,
JDG.5.23	because they did not come to help the 
JDG.5.23	to help the 
JDG.5.24	“Most blessed among women is Jael,
JDG.5.24	the wife of Heber the Kenite.
JDG.5.24	May she be blessed above all women who live in tents.
JDG.5.25	Sisera asked for water,
JDG.5.25	and she gave him milk.
JDG.5.25	In a bowl fit for nobles,
JDG.5.25	she brought him yogurt.
JDG.5.26	Then with her left hand she reached for a tent peg,
JDG.5.26	and with her right hand for the workman’s hammer.
JDG.5.26	She struck Sisera with the hammer, crushing his head.
JDG.5.26	With a shattering blow, she pierced his temples.
JDG.5.27	He sank, he fell,
JDG.5.27	he lay still at her feet.
JDG.5.27	And where he sank,
JDG.5.27	there he died.
JDG.5.28	“From the window Sisera’s mother looked out.
JDG.5.28	Through the window she watched for his return, saying,
JDG.5.28	‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?
JDG.5.28	Why don’t we hear the sound of chariot wheels?’
JDG.5.29	“Her wise women answer,
JDG.5.29	and she repeats these words to herself:
JDG.5.30	‘They must be dividing the captured plunder—
JDG.5.30	with a woman or two for every man.
JDG.5.30	There will be colorful robes for Sisera,
JDG.5.30	and colorful, embroidered robes for me.
JDG.5.30	Yes, the plunder will include
JDG.5.30	colorful robes embroidered on both sides.’
JDG.5.31	“
JDG.5.31	But may those who love you rise like the sun in all its power!”
JDG.5.31	Then there was peace in the land for forty years.
JDG.6.1	The Israelites did evil in the 
JDG.6.2	The Midianites were so cruel that the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds. 
JDG.6.3	Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, marauders from Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east would attack Israel, 
JDG.6.4	camping in the land and destroying crops as far away as Gaza. They left the Israelites with nothing to eat, taking all the sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys. 
JDG.6.5	These enemy hordes, coming with their livestock and tents, were as thick as locusts; they arrived on droves of camels too numerous to count. And they stayed until the land was stripped bare. 
JDG.6.6	So Israel was reduced to starvation by the Midianites. Then the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.6.7	When they cried out to the 
JDG.6.8	the 
JDG.6.9	I rescued you from the Egyptians and from all who oppressed you. I drove out your enemies and gave you their land. 
JDG.6.10	I told you, ‘I am the 
JDG.6.11	Then the angel of the 
JDG.6.12	The angel of the 
JDG.6.13	“Sir,” Gideon replied, “if the 
JDG.6.14	Then the 
JDG.6.15	“But Lord,” Gideon replied, “how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least in my entire family!”
JDG.6.16	The 
JDG.6.17	Gideon replied, “If you are truly going to help me, show me a sign to prove that it is really the 
JDG.6.18	Don’t go away until I come back and bring my offering to you.”
JDG.6.18	He answered, “I will stay here until you return.”
JDG.6.19	Gideon hurried home. He cooked a young goat, and with a basket
JDG.6.20	The angel of God said to him, “Place the meat and the unleavened bread on this rock, and pour the broth over it.” And Gideon did as he was told. 
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of the 
JDG.6.22	When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the 
JDG.6.23	“It is all right,” the 
JDG.6.24	And Gideon built an altar to the 
JDG.6.25	That night the 
JDG.6.26	Then build an altar to the 
JDG.6.27	So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the 
JDG.6.28	Early the next morning, as the people of the town began to stir, someone discovered that the altar of Baal had been broken down and that the Asherah pole beside it had been cut down. In their place a new altar had been built, and on it were the remains of the bull that had been sacrificed. 
JDG.6.29	The people said to each other, “Who did this?” And after asking around and making a careful search, they learned that it was Gideon, the son of Joash.
JDG.6.30	“Bring out your son,” the men of the town demanded of Joash. “He must die for destroying the altar of Baal and for cutting down the Asherah pole.”
JDG.6.31	But Joash shouted to the mob that confronted him, “Why are you defending Baal? Will you argue his case? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If Baal truly is a god, let him defend himself and destroy the one who broke down his altar!” 
JDG.6.32	From then on Gideon was called Jerub-baal, which means “Let Baal defend himself,” because he broke down Baal’s altar.
JDG.6.33	Soon afterward the armies of Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east formed an alliance against Israel and crossed the Jordan, camping in the valley of Jezreel. 
JDG.6.34	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	He also sent messengers throughout Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, summoning their warriors, and all of them responded.
JDG.6.36	Then Gideon said to God, “If you are truly going to use me to rescue Israel as you promised, 
JDG.6.37	prove it to me in this way. I will put a wool fleece on the threshing floor tonight. If the fleece is wet with dew in the morning but the ground is dry, then I will know that you are going to help me rescue Israel as you promised.” 
JDG.6.38	And that is just what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out a whole bowlful of water.
JDG.6.39	Then Gideon said to God, “Please don’t be angry with me, but let me make one more request. Let me use the fleece for one more test. This time let the fleece remain dry while the ground around it is wet with dew.” 
JDG.6.40	So that night God did as Gideon asked. The fleece was dry in the morning, but the ground was covered with dew.
JDG.7.1	So Jerub-baal (that is, Gideon) and his army got up early and went as far as the spring of Harod. The armies of Midian were camped north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh. 
JDG.7.2	The 
JDG.7.3	Therefore, tell the people, ‘Whoever is timid or afraid may leave this mountain
JDG.7.4	But the 
JDG.7.5	When Gideon took his warriors down to the water, the 
JDG.7.6	Only 300 of the men drank from their hands. All the others got down on their knees and drank with their mouths in the stream.
JDG.7.7	The 
JDG.7.8	So Gideon collected the provisions and rams’ horns of the other warriors and sent them home. But he kept the 300 men with him.
JDG.7.8	The Midianite camp was in the valley just below Gideon. 
JDG.7.9	That night the 
JDG.7.10	But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah. 
JDG.7.11	Listen to what the Midianites are saying, and you will be greatly encouraged. Then you will be eager to attack.”
JDG.7.11	So Gideon took Purah and went down to the edge of the enemy camp. 
JDG.7.12	The armies of Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east had settled in the valley like a swarm of locusts. Their camels were like grains of sand on the seashore—too many to count! 
JDG.7.13	Gideon crept up just as a man was telling his companion about a dream. The man said, “I had this dream, and in my dream a loaf of barley bread came tumbling down into the Midianite camp. It hit a tent, turned it over, and knocked it flat!”
JDG.7.14	His companion answered, “Your dream can mean only one thing—God has given Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite, victory over Midian and all its allies!”
JDG.7.15	When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship before the 
JDG.7.16	He divided the 300 men into three groups and gave each man a ram’s horn and a clay jar with a torch in it.
JDG.7.17	Then he said to them, “Keep your eyes on me. When I come to the edge of the camp, do just as I do. 
JDG.7.18	As soon as I and those with me blow the rams’ horns, blow your horns, too, all around the entire camp, and shout, ‘For the 
JDG.7.19	It was just after midnight,
JDG.7.20	Then all three groups blew their horns and broke their jars. They held the blazing torches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands, and they all shouted, “A sword for the 
JDG.7.21	Each man stood at his position around the camp and watched as all the Midianites rushed around in a panic, shouting as they ran to escape. 
JDG.7.22	When the 300 Israelites blew their rams’ horns, the 
JDG.7.23	Then Gideon sent for the warriors of Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh, who joined in chasing the army of Midian. 
JDG.7.24	Gideon also sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down to attack the Midianites. Cut them off at the shallow crossings of the Jordan River at Beth-barah.”
JDG.7.24	So all the men of Ephraim did as they were told. 
JDG.7.25	They captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two Midianite commanders, killing Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. And they continued to chase the Midianites. Afterward the Israelites brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan River.
JDG.8.1	Then the people of Ephraim asked Gideon, “Why have you treated us this way? Why didn’t you send for us when you first went out to fight the Midianites?” And they argued heatedly with Gideon.
JDG.8.2	But Gideon replied, “What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren’t even the leftover grapes of Ephraim’s harvest better than the entire crop of my little clan of Abiezer? 
JDG.8.3	God gave you victory over Oreb and Zeeb, the commanders of the Midianite army. What have I accomplished compared to that?” When the men of Ephraim heard Gideon’s answer, their anger subsided.
JDG.8.4	Gideon then crossed the Jordan River with his 300 men, and though exhausted, they continued to chase the enemy. 
JDG.8.5	When they reached Succoth, Gideon asked the leaders of the town, “Please give my warriors some food. They are very tired. I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
JDG.8.6	But the officials of Succoth replied, “Catch Zebah and Zalmunna first, and then we will feed your army.”
JDG.8.7	So Gideon said, “After the 
JDG.8.8	From there Gideon went up to Peniel
JDG.8.9	So he said to the people of Peniel, “After I return in victory, I will tear down this tower.”
JDG.8.10	By this time Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with about 15,000 warriors—all that remained of the allied armies of the east, for 120,000 had already been killed. 
JDG.8.11	Gideon circled around by the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, taking the Midianite army by surprise. 
JDG.8.12	Zebah and Zalmunna, the two Midianite kings, fled, but Gideon chased them down and captured all their warriors.
JDG.8.13	After this, Gideon returned from the battle by way of Heres Pass. 
JDG.8.14	There he captured a young man from Succoth and demanded that he write down the names of all the seventy-seven officials and elders in the town. 
JDG.8.15	Gideon then returned to Succoth and said to the leaders, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. When we were here before, you taunted me, saying, ‘Catch Zebah and Zalmunna first, and then we will feed your exhausted army.’” 
JDG.8.16	Then Gideon took the elders of the town and taught them a lesson, punishing them with thorns and briers from the wilderness. 
JDG.8.17	He also tore down the tower of Peniel and killed all the men in the town.
JDG.8.18	Then Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “The men you killed at Tabor—what were they like?”
JDG.8.18	“Like you,” they replied. “They all had the look of a king’s son.”
JDG.8.19	“They were my brothers, the sons of my own mother!” Gideon exclaimed. “As surely as the 
JDG.8.20	Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, “Kill them!” But Jether did not draw his sword, for he was only a boy and was afraid.
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, “Be a man! Kill us yourself!” So Gideon killed them both and took the royal ornaments from the necks of their camels.
JDG.8.22	Then the Israelites said to Gideon, “Be our ruler! You and your son and your grandson will be our rulers, for you have rescued us from Midian.”
JDG.8.23	But Gideon replied, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son. The 
JDG.8.24	However, I do have one request—that each of you give me an earring from the plunder you collected from your fallen enemies.” (The enemies, being Ishmaelites, all wore gold earrings.)
JDG.8.25	“Gladly!” they replied. They spread out a cloak, and each one threw in a gold earring he had gathered from the plunder. 
JDG.8.26	The weight of the gold earrings was forty-three pounds,
JDG.8.27	Gideon made a sacred ephod from the gold and put it in Ophrah, his hometown. But soon all the Israelites prostituted themselves by worshiping it, and it became a trap for Gideon and his family.
JDG.8.28	That is the story of how the people of Israel defeated Midian, which never recovered. Throughout the rest of Gideon’s lifetime—about forty years—there was peace in the land.
JDG.8.29	Then Gideon
JDG.8.30	He had seventy sons born to him, for he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	He also had a concubine in Shechem, who gave birth to a son, whom he named Abimelech. 
JDG.8.32	Gideon died when he was very old, and he was buried in the grave of his father, Joash, at Ophrah in the land of the clan of Abiezer.
JDG.8.33	As soon as Gideon died, the Israelites prostituted themselves by worshiping the images of Baal, making Baal-berith their god. 
JDG.8.34	They forgot the 
JDG.8.35	Nor did they show any loyalty to the family of Jerub-baal (that is, Gideon), despite all the good he had done for Israel.
JDG.9.1	One day Gideon’s
JDG.9.2	“Ask the leading citizens of Shechem whether they want to be ruled by all seventy of Gideon’s sons or by one man. And remember that I am your own flesh and blood!”
JDG.9.3	So Abimelech’s uncles gave his message to all the citizens of Shechem on his behalf. And after listening to this proposal, the people of Shechem decided in favor of Abimelech because he was their relative. 
JDG.9.4	They gave him seventy silver coins from the temple of Baal-berith, which he used to hire some reckless troublemakers who agreed to follow him. 
JDG.9.5	He went to his father’s home at Ophrah, and there, on one stone, they killed all seventy of his half brothers, the sons of Gideon.
JDG.9.6	Then all the leading citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo called a meeting under the oak beside the pillar
JDG.9.7	When Jotham heard about this, he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted,
JDG.9.7	“Listen to me, citizens of Shechem!
JDG.9.7	Listen to me if you want God to listen to you!
JDG.9.8	Once upon a time the trees decided to choose a king.
JDG.9.8	First they said to the olive tree,
JDG.9.8	‘Be our king!’
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree refused, saying,
JDG.9.9	‘Should I quit producing the olive oil
JDG.9.9	that blesses both God and people,
JDG.9.9	just to wave back and forth over the trees?’
JDG.9.10	“Then they said to the fig tree,
JDG.9.10	‘You be our king!’
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree also refused, saying,
JDG.9.11	‘Should I quit producing my sweet fruit
JDG.9.11	just to wave back and forth over the trees?’
JDG.9.12	“Then they said to the grapevine,
JDG.9.12	‘You be our king!’
JDG.9.13	But the grapevine also refused, saying,
JDG.9.13	‘Should I quit producing the wine
JDG.9.13	that cheers both God and people,
JDG.9.13	just to wave back and forth over the trees?’
JDG.9.14	“Then all the trees finally turned to the thornbush and said,
JDG.9.14	‘Come, you be our king!’
JDG.9.15	And the thornbush replied to the trees,
JDG.9.15	‘If you truly want to make me your king,
JDG.9.15	come and take shelter in my shade.
JDG.9.15	If not, let fire come out from me
JDG.9.15	and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’”
JDG.9.16	Jotham continued, “Now make sure you have acted honorably and in good faith by making Abimelech your king, and that you have done right by Gideon and all of his descendants. Have you treated him with the honor he deserves for all he accomplished? 
JDG.9.17	For he fought for you and risked his life when he rescued you from the Midianites. 
JDG.9.18	But today you have revolted against my father and his descendants, killing his seventy sons on one stone. And you have chosen his slave woman’s son, Abimelech, to be your king just because he is your relative.
JDG.9.19	“If you have acted honorably and in good faith toward Gideon and his descendants today, then may you find joy in Abimelech, and may he find joy in you. 
JDG.9.20	But if you have not acted in good faith, then may fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leading citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo; and may fire come out from the citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo and devour Abimelech!”
JDG.9.21	Then Jotham escaped and lived in Beer because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech.
JDG.9.22	After Abimelech had ruled over Israel for three years, 
JDG.9.23	God sent a spirit that stirred up trouble between Abimelech and the leading citizens of Shechem, and they revolted. 
JDG.9.24	God was punishing Abimelech for murdering Gideon’s seventy sons, and the citizens of Shechem for supporting him in this treachery of murdering his brothers. 
JDG.9.25	The citizens of Shechem set an ambush for Abimelech on the hilltops and robbed everyone who passed that way. But someone warned Abimelech about their plot.
JDG.9.26	One day Gaal son of Ebed moved to Shechem with his brothers and gained the confidence of the leading citizens of Shechem. 
JDG.9.27	During the annual harvest festival at Shechem, held in the temple of the local god, the wine flowed freely, and everyone began cursing Abimelech. 
JDG.9.28	“Who is Abimelech?” Gaal shouted. “He’s not a true son of Shechem,
JDG.9.29	If I were in charge here, I would get rid of Abimelech. I would say
JDG.9.30	But when Zebul, the leader of the city, heard what Gaal was saying, he was furious. 
JDG.9.31	He sent messengers to Abimelech in Arumah,
JDG.9.32	Come by night with an army and hide out in the fields. 
JDG.9.33	In the morning, as soon as it is daylight, attack the city. When Gaal and those who are with him come out against you, you can do with them as you wish.”
JDG.9.34	So Abimelech and all his men went by night and split into four groups, stationing themselves around Shechem. 
JDG.9.35	Gaal was standing at the city gates when Abimelech and his army came out of hiding. 
JDG.9.36	When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, “Look, there are people coming down from the hilltops!”
JDG.9.36	Zebul replied, “It’s just the shadows on the hills that look like men.”
JDG.9.37	But again Gaal said, “No, people are coming down from the hills.
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul turned on him and asked, “Now where is that big mouth of yours? Wasn’t it you that said, ‘Who is Abimelech, and why should we be his servants?’ The men you mocked are right outside the city! Go out and fight them!”
JDG.9.39	So Gaal led the leading citizens of Shechem into battle against Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	But Abimelech chased him, and many of Shechem’s men were wounded and fell along the road as they retreated to the city gate. 
JDG.9.41	Abimelech returned to Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.
JDG.9.42	The next day the people of Shechem went out into the fields to battle. When Abimelech heard about it, 
JDG.9.43	he divided his men into three groups and set an ambush in the fields. When Abimelech saw the people coming out of the city, he and his men jumped up from their hiding places and attacked them. 
JDG.9.44	Abimelech and his group stormed the city gate to keep the men of Shechem from getting back in, while Abimelech’s other two groups cut them down in the fields. 
JDG.9.45	The battle went on all day before Abimelech finally captured the city. He killed the people, leveled the city, and scattered salt all over the ground.
JDG.9.46	When the leading citizens who lived in the tower of Shechem heard what had happened, they ran and hid in the temple of Baal-berith.
JDG.9.47	Someone reported to Abimelech that the citizens had gathered in the temple, 
JDG.9.48	so he led his forces to Mount Zalmon. He took an ax and chopped some branches from a tree, then put them on his shoulder. “Quick, do as I have done!” he told his men. 
JDG.9.49	So each of them cut down some branches, following Abimelech’s example. They piled the branches against the walls of the temple and set them on fire. So all the people who had lived in the tower of Shechem died—about 1,000 men and women.
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech attacked the town of Thebez and captured it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower inside the town, and all the men and women—the entire population—fled to it. They barricaded themselves in and climbed up to the roof of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	Abimelech followed them to attack the tower. But as he prepared to set fire to the entrance, 
JDG.9.53	a woman on the roof dropped a millstone that landed on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull.
JDG.9.54	He quickly said to his young armor bearer, “Draw your sword and kill me! Don’t let it be said that a woman killed Abimelech!” So the young man ran him through with his sword, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	When Abimelech’s men saw that he was dead, they disbanded and returned to their homes.
JDG.9.56	In this way, God punished Abimelech for the evil he had done against his father by murdering his seventy brothers. 
JDG.9.57	God also punished the men of Shechem for all their evil. So the curse of Jotham son of Gideon was fulfilled.
JDG.10.1	After Abimelech died, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo, was the next person to rescue Israel. He was from the tribe of Issachar but lived in the town of Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	He judged Israel for twenty-three years. When he died, he was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	After Tola died, Jair from Gilead judged Israel for twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	His thirty sons rode around on thirty donkeys, and they owned thirty towns in the land of Gilead, which are still called the Towns of Jair.
JDG.10.5	When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon.
JDG.10.6	Again the Israelites did evil in the 
JDG.10.7	So the 
JDG.10.8	who began to oppress them that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites east of the Jordan River in the land of the Amorites (that is, in Gilead). 
JDG.10.9	The Ammonites also crossed to the west side of the Jordan and attacked Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim.
JDG.10.9	The Israelites were in great distress. 
JDG.10.10	Finally, they cried out to the 
JDG.10.11	The 
JDG.10.12	the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites? When they oppressed you, you cried out to me for help, and I rescued you. 
JDG.10.13	Yet you have abandoned me and served other gods. So I will not rescue you anymore. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen! Let them rescue you in your hour of distress!”
JDG.10.15	But the Israelites pleaded with the 
JDG.10.16	Then the Israelites put aside their foreign gods and served the 
JDG.10.17	At that time the armies of Ammon had gathered for war and were camped in Gilead, and the people of Israel assembled and camped at Mizpah. 
JDG.10.18	The leaders of Gilead said to each other, “Whoever attacks the Ammonites first will become ruler over all the people of Gilead.”
JDG.11.1	Now Jephthah of Gilead was a great warrior. He was the son of Gilead, but his mother was a prostitute. 
JDG.11.2	Gilead’s wife also had several sons, and when these half brothers grew up, they chased Jephthah off the land. “You will not get any of our father’s inheritance,” they said, “for you are the son of a prostitute.” 
JDG.11.3	So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Soon he had a band of worthless rebels following him.
JDG.11.4	At about this time, the Ammonites began their war against Israel. 
JDG.11.5	When the Ammonites attacked, the elders of Gilead sent for Jephthah in the land of Tob. 
JDG.11.6	The elders said, “Come and be our commander! Help us fight the Ammonites!”
JDG.11.7	But Jephthah said to them, “Aren’t you the ones who hated me and drove me from my father’s house? Why do you come to me now when you’re in trouble?”
JDG.11.8	“Because we need you,” the elders replied. “If you lead us in battle against the Ammonites, we will make you ruler over all the people of Gilead.”
JDG.11.9	Jephthah said to the elders, “Let me get this straight. If I come with you and if the 
JDG.11.10	“The 
JDG.11.11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their ruler and commander of the army. At Mizpah, in the presence of the 
JDG.11.12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon, asking, “Why have you come out to fight against my land?”
JDG.11.13	The king of Ammon answered Jephthah’s messengers, “When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they stole my land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River and all the way to the Jordan. Now then, give back the land peaceably.”
JDG.11.14	Jephthah sent this message back to the Ammonite king:
JDG.11.15	“This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not steal any land from Moab or Ammon. 
JDG.11.16	When the people of Israel arrived at Kadesh on their journey from Egypt after crossing the Red Sea,
JDG.11.17	they sent messengers to the king of Edom asking for permission to pass through his land. But their request was denied. Then they asked the king of Moab for similar permission, but he wouldn’t let them pass through either. So the people of Israel stayed in Kadesh.
JDG.11.18	“Finally, they went around Edom and Moab through the wilderness. They traveled along Moab’s eastern border and camped on the other side of the Arnon River. But they never once crossed the Arnon River into Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
JDG.11.19	“Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled from Heshbon, asking for permission to cross through his land to get to their destination. 
JDG.11.20	But King Sihon didn’t trust Israel to pass through his land. Instead, he mobilized his army at Jahaz and attacked them. 
JDG.11.21	But the 
JDG.11.22	from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River, and from the eastern wilderness to the Jordan.
JDG.11.23	“So you see, it was the 
JDG.11.24	You keep whatever your god Chemosh gives you, and we will keep whatever the 
JDG.11.25	Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he try to make a case against Israel for disputed land? Did he go to war against them?
JDG.11.26	“Israel has been living here for 300 years, inhabiting Heshbon and its surrounding settlements, all the way to Aroer and its settlements, and in all the towns along the Arnon River. Why have you made no effort to recover it before now? 
JDG.11.27	Therefore, I have not sinned against you. Rather, you have wronged me by attacking me. Let the 
JDG.11.28	But the king of Ammon paid no attention to Jephthah’s message.
JDG.11.29	At that time the Spirit of the 
JDG.11.30	And Jephthah made a vow to the 
JDG.11.31	I will give to the 
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah led his army against the Ammonites, and the 
JDG.11.33	He crushed the Ammonites, devastating about twenty towns from Aroer to an area near Minnith and as far away as Abel-keramim. In this way Israel defeated the Ammonites.
JDG.11.34	When Jephthah returned home to Mizpah, his daughter came out to meet him, playing on a tambourine and dancing for joy. She was his one and only child; he had no other sons or daughters. 
JDG.11.35	When he saw her, he tore his clothes in anguish. “Oh, my daughter!” he cried out. “You have completely destroyed me! You’ve brought disaster on me! For I have made a vow to the 
JDG.11.36	And she said, “Father, if you have made a vow to the 
JDG.11.37	But first let me do this one thing: Let me go up and roam in the hills and weep with my friends for two months, because I will die a virgin.”
JDG.11.38	“You may go,” Jephthah said. And he sent her away for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never have children. 
JDG.11.39	When she returned home, her father kept the vow he had made, and she died a virgin.
JDG.11.39	So it has become a custom in Israel 
JDG.11.40	for young Israelite women to go away for four days each year to lament the fate of Jephthah’s daughter.
JDG.12.1	Then the people of Ephraim mobilized an army and crossed over the Jordan River to Zaphon. They sent this message to Jephthah: “Why didn’t you call for us to help you fight against the Ammonites? We are going to burn down your house with you in it!”
JDG.12.2	Jephthah replied, “I summoned you at the beginning of the dispute, but you refused to come! You failed to help us in our struggle against Ammon. 
JDG.12.3	So when I realized you weren’t coming, I risked my life and went to battle without you, and the 
JDG.12.4	The people of Ephraim responded, “You men of Gilead are nothing more than fugitives from Ephraim and Manasseh.” So Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and attacked the men of Ephraim and defeated them.
JDG.12.5	Jephthah captured the shallow crossings of the Jordan River, and whenever a fugitive from Ephraim tried to go back across, the men of Gilead would challenge him. “Are you a member of the tribe of Ephraim?” they would ask. If the man said, “No, I’m not,” 
JDG.12.6	they would tell him to say “Shibboleth.” If he was from Ephraim, he would say “Sibboleth,” because people from Ephraim cannot pronounce the word correctly. Then they would take him and kill him at the shallow crossings of the Jordan. In all, 42,000 Ephraimites were killed at that time.
JDG.12.7	Jephthah judged Israel for six years. When he died, he was buried in one of the towns of Gilead.
JDG.12.8	After Jephthah died, Ibzan from Bethlehem judged Israel. 
JDG.12.9	He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He sent his daughters to marry men outside his clan, and he brought in thirty young women from outside his clan to marry his sons. Ibzan judged Israel for seven years. 
JDG.12.10	When he died, he was buried at Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	After Ibzan died, Elon from the tribe of Zebulun judged Israel for ten years. 
JDG.12.12	When he died, he was buried at Aijalon in Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	After Elon died, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, judged Israel. 
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years. 
JDG.12.15	When he died, he was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	Again the Israelites did evil in the 
JDG.13.2	In those days a man named Manoah from the tribe of Dan lived in the town of Zorah. His wife was unable to become pregnant, and they had no children. 
JDG.13.3	The angel of the 
JDG.13.4	So be careful; you must not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink nor eat any forbidden food.
JDG.13.5	You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and his hair must never be cut. For he will be dedicated to God as a Nazirite from birth. He will begin to rescue Israel from the Philistines.”
JDG.13.6	The woman ran and told her husband, “A man of God appeared to me! He looked like one of God’s angels, terrifying to see. I didn’t ask where he was from, and he didn’t tell me his name. 
JDG.13.7	But he told me, ‘You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You must not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink nor eat any forbidden food. For your son will be dedicated to God as a Nazirite from the moment of his birth until the day of his death.’”
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah prayed to the 
JDG.13.9	God answered Manoah’s prayer, and the angel of God appeared once again to his wife as she was sitting in the field. But her husband, Manoah, was not with her. 
JDG.13.10	So she quickly ran and told her husband, “The man who appeared to me the other day is here again!”
JDG.13.11	Manoah ran back with his wife and asked, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife the other day?”
JDG.13.11	“Yes,” he replied, “I am.”
JDG.13.12	So Manoah asked him, “When your words come true, what kind of rules should govern the boy’s life and work?”
JDG.13.13	The angel of the 
JDG.13.14	She must not eat grapes or raisins, drink wine or any other alcoholic drink, or eat any forbidden food.”
JDG.13.15	Then Manoah said to the angel of the 
JDG.13.16	“I will stay,” the angel of the 
JDG.13.17	Then Manoah asked the angel of the 
JDG.13.18	“Why do you ask my name?” the angel of the 
JDG.13.19	Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered it on a rock as a sacrifice to the 
JDG.13.20	As the flames from the altar shot up toward the sky, the angel of the 
JDG.13.21	The angel did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. Manoah finally realized it was the angel of the 
JDG.13.22	and he said to his wife, “We will certainly die, for we have seen God!”
JDG.13.23	But his wife said, “If the 
JDG.13.24	When her son was born, she named him Samson. And the 
JDG.13.25	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.1	One day when Samson was in Timnah, one of the Philistine women caught his eye. 
JDG.14.2	When he returned home, he told his father and mother, “A young Philistine woman in Timnah caught my eye. I want to marry her. Get her for me.”
JDG.14.3	His father and mother objected. “Isn’t there even one woman in our tribe or among all the Israelites you could marry?” they asked. “Why must you go to the pagan Philistines to find a wife?”
JDG.14.3	But Samson told his father, “Get her for me! She looks good to me.” 
JDG.14.4	His father and mother didn’t realize the 
JDG.14.5	As Samson and his parents were going down to Timnah, a young lion suddenly attacked Samson near the vineyards of Timnah. 
JDG.14.6	At that moment the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.7	When Samson arrived in Timnah, he talked with the woman and was very pleased with her.
JDG.14.8	Later, when he returned to Timnah for the wedding, he turned off the path to look at the carcass of the lion. And he found that a swarm of bees had made some honey in the carcass. 
JDG.14.9	He scooped some of the honey into his hands and ate it along the way. He also gave some to his father and mother, and they ate it. But he didn’t tell them he had taken the honey from the carcass of the lion.
JDG.14.10	As his father was making final arrangements for the marriage, Samson threw a party at Timnah, as was the custom for elite young men. 
JDG.14.11	When the bride’s parents
JDG.14.12	Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle. If you solve my riddle during these seven days of the celebration, I will give you thirty fine linen robes and thirty sets of festive clothing. 
JDG.14.13	But if you can’t solve it, then you must give me thirty fine linen robes and thirty sets of festive clothing.”
JDG.14.13	“All right,” they agreed, “let’s hear your riddle.”
JDG.14.14	So he said:
JDG.14.14	“Out of the one who eats came something to eat;
JDG.14.14	out of the strong came something sweet.”
JDG.14.14	Three days later they were still trying to figure it out. 
JDG.14.15	On the fourth
JDG.14.16	So Samson’s wife came to him in tears and said, “You don’t love me; you hate me! You have given my people a riddle, but you haven’t told me the answer.”
JDG.14.16	“I haven’t even given the answer to my father or mother,” he replied. “Why should I tell you?” 
JDG.14.17	So she cried whenever she was with him and kept it up for the rest of the celebration. At last, on the seventh day he told her the answer because she was tormenting him with her nagging. Then she explained the riddle to the young men.
JDG.14.18	So before sunset of the seventh day, the men of the town came to Samson with their answer:
JDG.14.18	“What is sweeter than honey?
JDG.14.18	What is stronger than a lion?”
JDG.14.18	Samson replied, “If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer, you wouldn’t have solved my riddle!”
JDG.14.19	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.20	So his wife was given in marriage to the man who had been Samson’s best man at the wedding.
JDG.15.1	Later on, during the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat as a present to his wife. He said, “I’m going into my wife’s room to sleep with her,” but her father wouldn’t let him in.
JDG.15.2	“I truly thought you must hate her,” her father explained, “so I gave her in marriage to your best man. But look, her younger sister is even more beautiful than she is. Marry her instead.”
JDG.15.3	Samson said, “This time I cannot be blamed for everything I am going to do to you Philistines.” 
JDG.15.4	Then he went out and caught 300 foxes. He tied their tails together in pairs, and he fastened a torch to each pair of tails. 
JDG.15.5	Then he lit the torches and let the foxes run through the grain fields of the Philistines. He burned all their grain to the ground, including the sheaves and the uncut grain. He also destroyed their vineyards and olive groves.
JDG.15.6	“Who did this?” the Philistines demanded.
JDG.15.6	“Samson,” was the reply, “because his father-in-law from Timnah gave Samson’s wife to be married to his best man.” So the Philistines went and got the woman and her father and burned them to death.
JDG.15.7	“Because you did this,” Samson vowed, “I won’t rest until I take my revenge on you!” 
JDG.15.8	So he attacked the Philistines with great fury and killed many of them. Then he went to live in a cave in the rock of Etam.
JDG.15.9	The Philistines retaliated by setting up camp in Judah and spreading out near the town of Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	The men of Judah asked the Philistines, “Why are you attacking us?”
JDG.15.10	The Philistines replied, “We’ve come to capture Samson. We’ve come to pay him back for what he did to us.”
JDG.15.11	So 3,000 men of Judah went down to get Samson at the cave in the rock of Etam. They said to Samson, “Don’t you realize the Philistines rule over us? What are you doing to us?”
JDG.15.11	But Samson replied, “I only did to them what they did to me.”
JDG.15.12	But the men of Judah told him, “We have come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.”
JDG.15.12	“All right,” Samson said. “But promise that you won’t kill me yourselves.”
JDG.15.13	“We will only tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines,” they replied. “We won’t kill you.” So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
JDG.15.14	As Samson arrived at Lehi, the Philistines came shouting in triumph. But the Spirit of the 
JDG.15.15	Then he found the jawbone of a recently killed donkey. He picked it up and killed 1,000 Philistines with it. 
JDG.15.16	Then Samson said,
JDG.15.16	“With the jawbone of a donkey,
JDG.15.16	I’ve piled them in heaps!
JDG.15.16	With the jawbone of a donkey,
JDG.15.16	I’ve killed a thousand men!”
JDG.15.17	When he finished his boasting, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was named Jawbone Hill.
JDG.15.18	Samson was now very thirsty, and he cried out to the 
JDG.15.19	So God caused water to gush out of a hollow in the ground at Lehi, and Samson was revived as he drank. Then he named that place “The Spring of the One Who Cried Out,”
JDG.15.20	Samson judged Israel for twenty years during the period when the Philistines dominated the land.
JDG.16.1	One day Samson went to the Philistine town of Gaza and spent the night with a prostitute. 
JDG.16.2	Word soon spread
JDG.16.3	But Samson stayed in bed only until midnight. Then he got up, took hold of the doors of the town gate, including the two posts, and lifted them up, bar and all. He put them on his shoulders and carried them all the way to the top of the hill across from Hebron.
JDG.16.4	Some time later Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the valley of Sorek. 
JDG.16.5	The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, “Entice Samson to tell you what makes him so strong and how he can be overpowered and tied up securely. Then each of us will give you 1,100 pieces
JDG.16.6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me what makes you so strong and what it would take to tie you up securely.”
JDG.16.7	Samson replied, “If I were tied up with seven new bowstrings that have not yet been dried, I would become as weak as anyone else.”
JDG.16.8	So the Philistine rulers brought Delilah seven new bowstrings, and she tied Samson up with them. 
JDG.16.9	She had hidden some men in one of the inner rooms of her house, and she cried out, “Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!” But Samson snapped the bowstrings as a piece of string snaps when it is burned by a fire. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.
JDG.16.10	Afterward Delilah said to him, “You’ve been making fun of me and telling me lies! Now please tell me how you can be tied up securely.”
JDG.16.11	Samson replied, “If I were tied up with brand-new ropes that had never been used, I would become as weak as anyone else.”
JDG.16.12	So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them. The men were hiding in the inner room as before, and again Delilah cried out, “Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!” But again Samson snapped the ropes from his arms as if they were thread.
JDG.16.13	Then Delilah said, “You’ve been making fun of me and telling me lies! Now tell me how you can be tied up securely.”
JDG.16.13	Samson replied, “If you were to weave the seven braids of my hair into the fabric on your loom and tighten it with the loom shuttle, I would become as weak as anyone else.”
JDG.16.13	So while he slept, Delilah wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric. 
JDG.16.14	Then she tightened it with the loom shuttle.
JDG.16.15	Then Delilah pouted, “How can you tell me, ‘I love you,’ when you don’t share your secrets with me? You’ve made fun of me three times now, and you still haven’t told me what makes you so strong!” 
JDG.16.16	She tormented him with her nagging day after day until he was sick to death of it.
JDG.16.17	Finally, Samson shared his secret with her. “My hair has never been cut,” he confessed, “for I was dedicated to God as a Nazirite from birth. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as anyone else.”
JDG.16.18	Delilah realized he had finally told her the truth, so she sent for the Philistine rulers. “Come back one more time,” she said, “for he has finally told me his secret.” So the Philistine rulers returned with the money in their hands. 
JDG.16.19	Delilah lulled Samson to sleep with his head in her lap, and then she called in a man to shave off the seven locks of his hair. In this way she began to bring him down,
JDG.16.20	Then she cried out, “Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!”
JDG.16.20	When he woke up, he thought, “I will do as before and shake myself free.” But he didn’t realize the 
JDG.16.21	So the Philistines captured him and gouged out his eyes. They took him to Gaza, where he was bound with bronze chains and forced to grind grain in the prison.
JDG.16.22	But before long, his hair began to grow back.
JDG.16.23	The Philistine rulers held a great festival, offering sacrifices and praising their god, Dagon. They said, “Our god has given us victory over our enemy Samson!”
JDG.16.24	When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, “Our god has delivered our enemy to us! The one who killed so many of us is now in our power!”
JDG.16.25	Half drunk by now, the people demanded, “Bring out Samson so he can amuse us!” So he was brought from the prison to amuse them, and they had him stand between the pillars supporting the roof.
JDG.16.26	Samson said to the young servant who was leading him by the hand, “Place my hands against the pillars that hold up the temple. I want to rest against them.” 
JDG.16.27	Now the temple was completely filled with people. All the Philistine rulers were there, and there were about 3,000 men and women on the roof who were watching as Samson amused them.
JDG.16.28	Then Samson prayed to the 
JDG.16.29	Then Samson put his hands on the two center pillars that held up the temple. Pushing against them with both hands, 
JDG.16.30	he prayed, “Let me die with the Philistines.” And the temple crashed down on the Philistine rulers and all the people. So he killed more people when he died than he had during his entire lifetime.
JDG.16.31	Later his brothers and other relatives went down to get his body. They took him back home and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol, where his father, Manoah, was buried. Samson had judged Israel for twenty years.
JDG.17.1	There was a man named Micah, who lived in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.17.2	One day he said to his mother, “I heard you place a curse on the person who stole 1,100 pieces
JDG.17.2	“The 
JDG.17.3	He returned the money to her, and she said, “I now dedicate these silver coins to the 
JDG.17.4	So when he returned the money to his mother, she took 200 silver coins and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into an image and an idol. And these were placed in Micah’s house. 
JDG.17.5	Micah set up a shrine for the idol, and he made a sacred ephod and some household idols. Then he installed one of his sons as his personal priest.
JDG.17.6	In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes.
JDG.17.7	One day a young Levite, who had been living in Bethlehem in Judah, arrived in that area. 
JDG.17.8	He had left Bethlehem in search of another place to live, and as he traveled, he came to the hill country of Ephraim. He happened to stop at Micah’s house as he was traveling through. 
JDG.17.9	“Where are you from?” Micah asked him.
JDG.17.9	He replied, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am looking for a place to live.”
JDG.17.10	“Stay here with me,” Micah said, “and you can be a father and priest to me. I will give you ten pieces of silver
JDG.17.11	The Levite agreed to this, and the young man became like one of Micah’s sons.
JDG.17.12	So Micah installed the Levite as his personal priest, and he lived in Micah’s house. 
JDG.17.13	“I know the 
JDG.18.1	Now in those days Israel had no king. And the tribe of Dan was trying to find a place where they could settle, for they had not yet moved into the land assigned to them when the land was divided among the tribes of Israel. 
JDG.18.2	So the men of Dan chose from their clans five capable warriors from the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol to scout out a land for them to settle in.
JDG.18.2	When these warriors arrived in the hill country of Ephraim, they came to Micah’s house and spent the night there. 
JDG.18.3	While at Micah’s house, they recognized the young Levite’s accent, so they went over and asked him, “Who brought you here, and what are you doing in this place? Why are you here?” 
JDG.18.4	He told them about his agreement with Micah and that he had been hired as Micah’s personal priest.
JDG.18.5	Then they said, “Ask God whether or not our journey will be successful.”
JDG.18.6	“Go in peace,” the priest replied. “For the 
JDG.18.7	So the five men went on to the town of Laish, where they noticed the people living carefree lives, like the Sidonians; they were peaceful and secure.
JDG.18.8	When the men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their relatives asked them, “What did you find?”
JDG.18.9	The men replied, “Come on, let’s attack them! We have seen the land, and it is very good. What are you waiting for? Don’t hesitate to go and take possession of it. 
JDG.18.10	When you get there, you will find the people living carefree lives. God has given us a spacious and fertile land, lacking in nothing!”
JDG.18.11	So 600 men from the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol. 
JDG.18.12	They camped at a place west of Kiriath-jearim in Judah, which is called Mahaneh-dan
JDG.18.13	Then they went on from there into the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.
JDG.18.14	The five men who had scouted out the land around Laish explained to the others, “These buildings contain a sacred ephod, as well as some household idols, a carved image, and a cast idol. What do you think you should do?” 
JDG.18.15	Then the five men turned off the road and went over to Micah’s house, where the young Levite lived, and greeted him kindly. 
JDG.18.16	As the 600 armed warriors from the tribe of Dan stood at the entrance of the gate, 
JDG.18.17	the five scouts entered the shrine and removed the carved image, the sacred ephod, the household idols, and the cast idol. Meanwhile, the priest was standing at the gate with the 600 armed warriors.
JDG.18.18	When the priest saw the men carrying all the sacred objects out of Micah’s shrine, he said, “What are you doing?”
JDG.18.19	“Be quiet and come with us,” they said. “Be a father and priest to all of us. Isn’t it better to be a priest for an entire tribe and clan of Israel than for the household of just one man?”
JDG.18.20	The young priest was quite happy to go with them, so he took along the sacred ephod, the household idols, and the carved image. 
JDG.18.21	They turned and started on their way again, placing their children, livestock, and possessions in front of them.
JDG.18.22	When the people from the tribe of Dan were quite a distance from Micah’s house, the people who lived near Micah came chasing after them. 
JDG.18.23	They were shouting as they caught up with them. The men of Dan turned around and said to Micah, “What’s the matter? Why have you called these men together and chased after us like this?”
JDG.18.24	“What do you mean, ‘What’s the matter?’” Micah replied. “You’ve taken away all the gods I have made, and my priest, and I have nothing left!”
JDG.18.25	The men of Dan said, “Watch what you say! There are some short-tempered men around here who might get angry and kill you and your family.” 
JDG.18.26	So the men of Dan continued on their way. When Micah saw that there were too many of them for him to attack, he turned around and went home.
JDG.18.27	Then, with Micah’s idols and his priest, the men of Dan came to the town of Laish, whose people were peaceful and secure. They attacked with swords and burned the town to the ground. 
JDG.18.28	There was no one to rescue the people, for they lived a great distance from Sidon and had no allies nearby. This happened in the valley near Beth-rehob.
JDG.18.28	Then the people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the town and lived there. 
JDG.18.29	They renamed the town Dan after their ancestor, Israel’s son, but it had originally been called Laish.
JDG.18.30	Then they set up the carved image, and they appointed Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses,
JDG.18.31	So Micah’s carved image was worshiped by the tribe of Dan as long as the Tabernacle of God remained at Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	Now in those days Israel had no king. There was a man from the tribe of Levi living in a remote area of the hill country of Ephraim. One day he brought home a woman from Bethlehem in Judah to be his concubine. 
JDG.19.2	But she became angry with him
JDG.19.2	After about four months, 
JDG.19.3	her husband set out for Bethlehem to speak personally to her and persuade her to come back. He took with him a servant and a pair of donkeys. When he arrived at
JDG.19.4	Her father urged him to stay awhile, so he stayed three days, eating, drinking, and sleeping there.
JDG.19.5	On the fourth day the man was up early, ready to leave, but the woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Have something to eat before you go.” 
JDG.19.6	So the two men sat down together and had something to eat and drink. Then the woman’s father said, “Please stay another night and enjoy yourself.” 
JDG.19.7	The man got up to leave, but his father-in-law kept urging him to stay, so he finally gave in and stayed the night.
JDG.19.8	On the morning of the fifth day he was up early again, ready to leave, and again the woman’s father said, “Have something to eat; then you can leave later this afternoon.” So they had another day of feasting. 
JDG.19.9	Later, as the man and his concubine and servant were preparing to leave, his father-in-law said, “Look, it’s almost evening. Stay the night and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow you can get up early and be on your way.”
JDG.19.10	But this time the man was determined to leave. So he took his two saddled donkeys and his concubine and headed in the direction of Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). 
JDG.19.11	It was late in the day when they neared Jebus, and the man’s servant said to him, “Let’s stop at this Jebusite town and spend the night there.”
JDG.19.12	“No,” his master said, “we can’t stay in this foreign town where there are no Israelites. Instead, we will go on to Gibeah. 
JDG.19.13	Come on, let’s try to get as far as Gibeah or Ramah, and we’ll spend the night in one of those towns.” 
JDG.19.14	So they went on. The sun was setting as they came to Gibeah, a town in the land of Benjamin, 
JDG.19.15	so they stopped there to spend the night. They rested in the town square, but no one took them in for the night.
JDG.19.16	That evening an old man came home from his work in the fields. He was from the hill country of Ephraim, but he was living in Gibeah, where the people were from the tribe of Benjamin. 
JDG.19.17	When he saw the travelers sitting in the town square, he asked them where they were from and where they were going.
JDG.19.18	“We have been in Bethlehem in Judah,” the man replied. “We are on our way to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim, which is my home. I traveled to Bethlehem, and now I’m returning home.
JDG.19.19	even though we have everything we need. We have straw and feed for our donkeys and plenty of bread and wine for ourselves.”
JDG.19.20	“You are welcome to stay with me,” the old man said. “I will give you anything you might need. But whatever you do, don’t spend the night in the square.” 
JDG.19.21	So he took them home with him and fed the donkeys. After they washed their feet, they ate and drank together.
JDG.19.22	While they were enjoying themselves, a crowd of troublemakers from the town surrounded the house. They began beating at the door and shouting to the old man, “Bring out the man who is staying with you so we can have sex with him.”
JDG.19.23	The old man stepped outside to talk to them. “No, my brothers, don’t do such an evil thing. For this man is a guest in my house, and such a thing would be shameful. 
JDG.19.24	Here, take my virgin daughter and this man’s concubine. I will bring them out to you, and you can abuse them and do whatever you like. But don’t do such a shameful thing to this man.”
JDG.19.25	But they wouldn’t listen to him. So the Levite took hold of his concubine and pushed her out the door. The men of the town abused her all night, taking turns raping her until morning. Finally, at dawn they let her go. 
JDG.19.26	At daybreak the woman returned to the house where her husband was staying. She collapsed at the door of the house and lay there until it was light.
JDG.19.27	When her husband opened the door to leave, there lay his concubine with her hands on the threshold. 
JDG.19.28	He said, “Get up! Let’s go!” But there was no answer.
JDG.19.29	When he got home, he took a knife and cut his concubine’s body into twelve pieces. Then he sent one piece to each tribe throughout all the territory of Israel.
JDG.19.30	Everyone who saw it said, “Such a horrible crime has not been committed in all the time since Israel left Egypt. Think about it! What are we going to do? Who’s going to speak up?”
JDG.20.1	Then all the Israelites were united as one man, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, including those from across the Jordan in the land of Gilead. The entire community assembled in the presence of the 
JDG.20.2	The leaders of all the people and all the tribes of Israel—400,000 warriors armed with swords—took their positions in the assembly of the people of God. 
JDG.20.3	(Word soon reached the land of Benjamin that the other tribes had gone up to Mizpah.) The Israelites then asked how this terrible crime had happened.
JDG.20.4	The Levite, the husband of the woman who had been murdered, said, “My concubine and I came to spend the night in Gibeah, a town that belongs to the people of Benjamin. 
JDG.20.5	That night some of the leading citizens of Gibeah surrounded the house, planning to kill me, and they raped my concubine until she was dead. 
JDG.20.6	So I cut her body into twelve pieces and sent the pieces throughout the territory assigned to Israel, for these men have committed a terrible and shameful crime. 
JDG.20.7	Now then, all of you—the entire community of Israel—must decide here and now what should be done about this!”
JDG.20.8	And all the people rose to their feet in unison and declared, “None of us will return home! No, not even one of us! 
JDG.20.9	Instead, this is what we will do to Gibeah; we will draw lots to decide who will attack it. 
JDG.20.10	One-tenth of the men
JDG.20.11	So all the Israelites were completely united, and they gathered together to attack the town.
JDG.20.12	The Israelites sent messengers to the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What a terrible thing has been done among you! 
JDG.20.13	Give up those evil men, those troublemakers from Gibeah, so we can execute them and purge Israel of this evil.”
JDG.20.13	But the people of Benjamin would not listen. 
JDG.20.14	Instead, they came from their towns and gathered at Gibeah to fight the Israelites. 
JDG.20.15	In all, 26,000 of their warriors armed with swords arrived in Gibeah to join the 700 elite troops who lived there. 
JDG.20.16	Among Benjamin’s elite troops, 700 were left-handed, and each of them could sling a rock and hit a target within a hairsbreadth without missing. 
JDG.20.17	Israel had 400,000 experienced soldiers armed with swords, not counting Benjamin’s warriors.
JDG.20.18	Before the battle the Israelites went to Bethel and asked God, “Which tribe should go first to attack the people of Benjamin?”
JDG.20.18	The 
JDG.20.19	So the Israelites left early the next morning and camped near Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	Then they advanced toward Gibeah to attack the men of Benjamin. 
JDG.20.21	But Benjamin’s warriors, who were defending the town, came out and killed 22,000 Israelites on the battlefield that day.
JDG.20.22	But the Israelites encouraged each other and took their positions again at the same place they had fought the previous day. 
JDG.20.23	For they had gone up to Bethel and wept in the presence of the 
JDG.20.23	And the 
JDG.20.24	So the next day they went out again to fight against the men of Benjamin, 
JDG.20.25	but the men of Benjamin killed another 18,000 Israelites, all of whom were experienced with the sword.
JDG.20.26	Then all the Israelites went up to Bethel and wept in the presence of the 
JDG.20.27	The Israelites went up seeking direction from the 
JDG.20.28	and Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron was the priest.) The Israelites asked the 
JDG.20.28	The 
JDG.20.29	So the Israelites set an ambush all around Gibeah. 
JDG.20.30	They went out on the third day and took their positions at the same place as before. 
JDG.20.31	When the men of Benjamin came out to attack, they were drawn away from the town. And as they had done before, they began to kill the Israelites. About thirty Israelites died in the open fields and along the roads, one leading to Bethel and the other leading back to Gibeah.
JDG.20.32	Then the warriors of Benjamin shouted, “We’re defeating them as we did before!” But the Israelites had planned in advance to run away so that the men of Benjamin would chase them along the roads and be drawn away from the town.
JDG.20.33	When the main group of Israelite warriors reached Baal-tamar, they turned and took up their positions. Meanwhile, the Israelites hiding in ambush to the west
JDG.20.34	There were 10,000 elite Israelite troops who advanced against Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that Benjamin didn’t realize the impending disaster. 
JDG.20.35	So the 
JDG.20.36	Then the men of Benjamin saw that they were beaten.
JDG.20.36	The Israelites had retreated from Benjamin’s warriors in order to give those hiding in ambush more room to maneuver against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.37	Then those who were hiding rushed in from all sides and killed everyone in the town. 
JDG.20.38	They had arranged to send up a large cloud of smoke from the town as a signal. 
JDG.20.39	When the Israelites saw the smoke, they turned and attacked Benjamin’s warriors.
JDG.20.39	By that time Benjamin’s warriors had killed about thirty Israelites, and they shouted, “We’re defeating them as we did in the first battle!” 
JDG.20.40	But when the warriors of Benjamin looked behind them and saw the smoke rising into the sky from every part of the town, 
JDG.20.41	the men of Israel turned and attacked. At this point the men of Benjamin became terrified, because they realized disaster was close at hand. 
JDG.20.42	So they turned around and fled before the Israelites toward the wilderness. But they couldn’t escape the battle, and the people who came out of the nearby towns were also killed.
JDG.20.43	The Israelites surrounded the men of Benjamin and chased them relentlessly, finally overtaking them east of Gibeah.
JDG.20.44	That day 18,000 of Benjamin’s strongest warriors died in battle. 
JDG.20.45	The survivors fled into the wilderness toward the rock of Rimmon, but Israel killed 5,000 of them along the road. They continued the chase until they had killed another 2,000 near Gidom.
JDG.20.46	So that day the tribe of Benjamin lost 25,000 strong warriors armed with swords, 
JDG.20.47	leaving only 600 men who escaped to the rock of Rimmon, where they lived for four months. 
JDG.20.48	And the Israelites returned and slaughtered every living thing in all the towns—the people, the livestock, and everything they found. They also burned down all the towns they came to.
JDG.21.1	The Israelites had vowed at Mizpah, “We will never give our daughters in marriage to a man from the tribe of Benjamin.” 
JDG.21.2	Now the people went to Bethel and sat in the presence of God until evening, weeping loudly and bitterly. 
JDG.21.3	“O 
JDG.21.4	Early the next morning the people built an altar and presented their burnt offerings and peace offerings on it. 
JDG.21.5	Then they said, “Who among the tribes of Israel did not join us at Mizpah when we held our assembly in the presence of the 
JDG.21.6	The Israelites felt sorry for their brother Benjamin and said, “Today one of the tribes of Israel has been cut off. 
JDG.21.7	How can we find wives for the few who remain, since we have sworn by the 
JDG.21.8	So they asked, “Who among the tribes of Israel did not join us at Mizpah when we assembled in the presence of the 
JDG.21.9	For after they counted all the people, no one from Jabesh-gilead was present.
JDG.21.10	So the assembly sent 12,000 of their best warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and children. 
JDG.21.11	“This is what you are to do,” they said. “Completely destroy
JDG.21.12	Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found 400 young virgins who had never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
JDG.21.13	The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the remaining people of Benjamin who were living at the rock of Rimmon. 
JDG.21.14	Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes, and the 400 women of Jabesh-gilead who had been spared were given to them as wives. But there were not enough women for all of them.
JDG.21.15	The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the 
JDG.21.16	So the elders of the assembly asked, “How can we find wives for the few who remain, since the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead? 
JDG.21.17	There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel is not wiped out. 
JDG.21.18	But we cannot give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this will fall under God’s curse.”
JDG.21.19	Then they thought of the annual festival of the 
JDG.21.20	They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives, “Go and hide in the vineyards. 
JDG.21.21	When you see the young women of Shiloh come out for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can take one of them home to the land of Benjamin to be your wife! 
JDG.21.22	And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, ‘Please be sympathetic. Let them have your daughters, for we didn’t find wives for all of them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not actually give your daughters to them in marriage.’”
JDG.21.23	So the men of Benjamin did as they were told. Each man caught one of the women as she danced in the celebration and carried her off to be his wife. They returned to their own land, and they rebuilt their towns and lived in them.
JDG.21.24	Then the people of Israel departed by tribes and families, and they returned to their own homes.
JDG.21.25	In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes.
RUT.1.1	In the days when the judges ruled in Israel, a severe famine came upon the land. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah left his home and went to live in the country of Moab, taking his wife and two sons with him. 
RUT.1.2	The man’s name was Elimelech, and his wife was Naomi. Their two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in the land of Judah. And when they reached Moab, they settled there.
RUT.1.3	Then Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	The two sons married Moabite women. One married a woman named Orpah, and the other a woman named Ruth. But about ten years later, 
RUT.1.5	both Mahlon and Kilion died. This left Naomi alone, without her two sons or her husband.
RUT.1.6	Then Naomi heard in Moab that the 
RUT.1.7	With her two daughters-in-law she set out from the place where she had been living, and they took the road that would lead them back to Judah.
RUT.1.8	But on the way, Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back to your mothers’ homes. And may the 
RUT.1.9	May the 
RUT.1.10	“No,” they said. “We want to go with you to your people.”
RUT.1.11	But Naomi replied, “Why should you go on with me? Can I still give birth to other sons who could grow up to be your husbands? 
RUT.1.12	No, my daughters, return to your parents’ homes, for I am too old to marry again. And even if it were possible, and I were to get married tonight and bear sons, then what? 
RUT.1.13	Would you wait for them to grow up and refuse to marry someone else? No, of course not, my daughters! Things are far more bitter for me than for you, because the 
RUT.1.14	And again they wept together, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye. But Ruth clung tightly to Naomi. 
RUT.1.15	“Look,” Naomi said to her, “your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods. You should do the same.”
RUT.1.16	But Ruth replied, “Don’t ask me to leave you and turn back. Wherever you go, I will go; wherever you live, I will live. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. 
RUT.1.17	Wherever you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the 
RUT.1.18	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she said nothing more.
RUT.1.19	So the two of them continued on their journey. When they came to Bethlehem, the entire town was excited by their arrival. “Is it really Naomi?” the women asked.
RUT.1.20	“Don’t call me Naomi,” she responded. “Instead, call me Mara,
RUT.1.21	I went away full, but the 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned from Moab, accompanied by her daughter-in-law Ruth, the young Moabite woman. They arrived in Bethlehem in late spring, at the beginning of the barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	Now there was a wealthy and influential man in Bethlehem named Boaz, who was a relative of Naomi’s husband, Elimelech.
RUT.2.2	One day Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go out into the harvest fields to pick up the stalks of grain left behind by anyone who is kind enough to let me do it.”
RUT.2.2	Naomi replied, “All right, my daughter, go ahead.” 
RUT.2.3	So Ruth went out to gather grain behind the harvesters. And as it happened, she found herself working in a field that belonged to Boaz, the relative of her father-in-law, Elimelech.
RUT.2.4	While she was there, Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters. “The 
RUT.2.4	“The 
RUT.2.5	Then Boaz asked his foreman, “Who is that young woman over there? Who does she belong to?”
RUT.2.6	And the foreman replied, “She is the young woman from Moab who came back with Naomi. 
RUT.2.7	She asked me this morning if she could gather grain behind the harvesters. She has been hard at work ever since, except for a few minutes’ rest in the shelter.”
RUT.2.8	Boaz went over and said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Stay right here with us when you gather grain; don’t go to any other fields. Stay right behind the young women working in my field. 
RUT.2.9	See which part of the field they are harvesting, and then follow them. I have warned the young men not to treat you roughly. And when you are thirsty, help yourself to the water they have drawn from the well.”
RUT.2.10	Ruth fell at his feet and thanked him warmly. “What have I done to deserve such kindness?” she asked. “I am only a foreigner.”
RUT.2.11	“Yes, I know,” Boaz replied. “But I also know about everything you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband. I have heard how you left your father and mother and your own land to live here among complete strangers. 
RUT.2.12	May the 
RUT.2.13	“I hope I continue to please you, sir,” she replied. “You have comforted me by speaking so kindly to me, even though I am not one of your workers.”
RUT.2.14	At mealtime Boaz called to her, “Come over here, and help yourself to some food. You can dip your bread in the sour wine.” So she sat with his harvesters, and Boaz gave her some roasted grain to eat. She ate all she wanted and still had some left over.
RUT.2.15	When Ruth went back to work again, Boaz ordered his young men, “Let her gather grain right among the sheaves without stopping her. 
RUT.2.16	And pull out some heads of barley from the bundles and drop them on purpose for her. Let her pick them up, and don’t give her a hard time!”
RUT.2.17	So Ruth gathered barley there all day, and when she beat out the grain that evening, it filled an entire basket.
RUT.2.18	She carried it back into town and showed it to her mother-in-law. Ruth also gave her the roasted grain that was left over from her meal.
RUT.2.19	“Where did you gather all this grain today?” Naomi asked. “Where did you work? May the 
RUT.2.19	So Ruth told her mother-in-law about the man in whose field she had worked. She said, “The man I worked with today is named Boaz.”
RUT.2.20	“May the 
RUT.2.21	Then Ruth
RUT.2.22	“Good!” Naomi exclaimed. “Do as he said, my daughter. Stay with his young women right through the whole harvest. You might be harassed in other fields, but you’ll be safe with him.”
RUT.2.23	So Ruth worked alongside the women in Boaz’s fields and gathered grain with them until the end of the barley harvest. Then she continued working with them through the wheat harvest in early summer. And all the while she lived with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	One day Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, it’s time that I found a permanent home for you, so that you will be provided for. 
RUT.3.2	Boaz is a close relative of ours, and he’s been very kind by letting you gather grain with his young women. Tonight he will be winnowing barley at the threshing floor. 
RUT.3.3	Now do as I tell you—take a bath and put on perfume and dress in your nicest clothes. Then go to the threshing floor, but don’t let Boaz see you until he has finished eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	Be sure to notice where he lies down; then go and uncover his feet and lie down there. He will tell you what to do.”
RUT.3.5	“I will do everything you say,” Ruth replied. 
RUT.3.6	So she went down to the threshing floor that night and followed the instructions of her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.7	After Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he lay down at the far end of the pile of grain and went to sleep. Then Ruth came quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. 
RUT.3.8	Around midnight Boaz suddenly woke up and turned over. He was surprised to find a woman lying at his feet! 
RUT.3.9	“Who are you?” he asked.
RUT.3.9	“I am your servant Ruth,” she replied. “Spread the corner of your covering over me, for you are my family redeemer.”
RUT.3.10	“The 
RUT.3.11	Now don’t worry about a thing, my daughter. I will do what is necessary, for everyone in town knows you are a virtuous woman. 
RUT.3.12	But while it’s true that I am one of your family redeemers, there is another man who is more closely related to you than I am. 
RUT.3.13	Stay here tonight, and in the morning I will talk to him. If he is willing to redeem you, very well. Let him marry you. But if he is not willing, then as surely as the 
RUT.3.14	So Ruth lay at Boaz’s feet until the morning, but she got up before it was light enough for people to recognize each other. For Boaz had said, “No one must know that a woman was here at the threshing floor.” 
RUT.3.15	Then Boaz said to her, “Bring your cloak and spread it out.” He measured six scoops
RUT.3.16	When Ruth went back to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “What happened, my daughter?”
RUT.3.16	Ruth told Naomi everything Boaz had done for her, 
RUT.3.17	and she added, “He gave me these six scoops of barley and said, ‘Don’t go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’”
RUT.3.18	Then Naomi said to her, “Just be patient, my daughter, until we hear what happens. The man won’t rest until he has settled things today.”
RUT.4.1	Boaz went to the town gate and took a seat there. Just then the family redeemer he had mentioned came by, so Boaz called out to him, “Come over here and sit down, friend. I want to talk to you.” So they sat down together. 
RUT.4.2	Then Boaz called ten leaders from the town and asked them to sit as witnesses. 
RUT.4.3	And Boaz said to the family redeemer, “You know Naomi, who came back from Moab. She is selling the land that belonged to our relative Elimelech. 
RUT.4.4	I thought I should speak to you about it so that you can redeem it if you wish. If you want the land, then buy it here in the presence of these witnesses. But if you don’t want it, let me know right away, because I am next in line to redeem it after you.”
RUT.4.4	The man replied, “All right, I’ll redeem it.”
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz told him, “Of course, your purchase of the land from Naomi also requires that you marry Ruth, the Moabite widow. That way she can have children who will carry on her husband’s name and keep the land in the family.”
RUT.4.6	“Then I can’t redeem it,” the family redeemer replied, “because this might endanger my own estate. You redeem the land; I cannot do it.”
RUT.4.7	Now in those days it was the custom in Israel for anyone transferring a right of purchase to remove his sandal and hand it to the other party. This publicly validated the transaction. 
RUT.4.8	So the other family redeemer drew off his sandal as he said to Boaz, “You buy the land.”
RUT.4.9	Then Boaz said to the elders and to the crowd standing around, “You are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	And with the land I have acquired Ruth, the Moabite widow of Mahlon, to be my wife. This way she can have a son to carry on the family name of her dead husband and to inherit the family property here in his hometown. You are all witnesses today.”
RUT.4.11	Then the elders and all the people standing in the gate replied, “We are witnesses! May the 
RUT.4.12	And may the 
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth into his home, and she became his wife. When he slept with her, the 
RUT.4.14	Then the women of the town said to Naomi, “Praise the 
RUT.4.15	May he restore your youth and care for you in your old age. For he is the son of your daughter-in-law who loves you and has been better to you than seven sons!”
RUT.4.16	Naomi took the baby and cuddled him to her breast. And she cared for him as if he were her own. 
RUT.4.17	The neighbor women said, “Now at last Naomi has a son again!” And they named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse and the grandfather of David.
RUT.4.18	This is the genealogical record of their ancestor Perez:
RUT.4.18	Perez was the father of Hezron.
RUT.4.19	Hezron was the father of Ram.
RUT.4.19	Ram was the father of Amminadab.
RUT.4.20	Amminadab was the father of Nahshon.
RUT.4.20	Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
RUT.4.21	Salmon was the father of Boaz.
RUT.4.21	Boaz was the father of Obed.
RUT.4.22	Obed was the father of Jesse.
RUT.4.22	Jesse was the father of David.
1SA.1.1	There was a man named Elkanah who lived in Ramah in the region of Zuph
1SA.1.2	Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not.
1SA.1.3	Each year Elkanah would travel to Shiloh to worship and sacrifice to the 
1SA.1.4	On the days Elkanah presented his sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to Peninnah and each of her children. 
1SA.1.5	And though he loved Hannah, he would give her only one choice portion
1SA.1.6	So Peninnah would taunt Hannah and make fun of her because the 
1SA.1.7	Year after year it was the same—Peninnah would taunt Hannah as they went to the Tabernacle.
1SA.1.8	“Why are you crying, Hannah?” Elkanah would ask. “Why aren’t you eating? Why be downhearted just because you have no children? You have me—isn’t that better than having ten sons?”
1SA.1.9	Once after a sacrificial meal at Shiloh, Hannah got up and went to pray. Eli the priest was sitting at his customary place beside the entrance of the Tabernacle.
1SA.1.10	Hannah was in deep anguish, crying bitterly as she prayed to the 
1SA.1.11	And she made this vow: “O 
1SA.1.12	As she was praying to the 
1SA.1.13	Seeing her lips moving but hearing no sound, he thought she had been drinking. 
1SA.1.14	“Must you come here drunk?” he demanded. “Throw away your wine!”
1SA.1.15	“Oh no, sir!” she replied. “I haven’t been drinking wine or anything stronger. But I am very discouraged, and I was pouring out my heart to the 
1SA.1.16	Don’t think I am a wicked woman! For I have been praying out of great anguish and sorrow.”
1SA.1.17	“In that case,” Eli said, “go in peace! May the God of Israel grant the request you have asked of him.”
1SA.1.18	“Oh, thank you, sir!” she exclaimed. Then she went back and began to eat again, and she was no longer sad.
1SA.1.19	The entire family got up early the next morning and went to worship the 
1SA.1.20	and in due time she gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,
1SA.1.21	The next year Elkanah and his family went on their annual trip to offer a sacrifice to the 
1SA.1.22	But Hannah did not go. She told her husband, “Wait until the boy is weaned. Then I will take him to the Tabernacle and leave him there with the 
1SA.1.23	“Whatever you think is best,” Elkanah agreed. “Stay here for now, and may the 
1SA.1.24	When the child was weaned, Hannah took him to the Tabernacle in Shiloh. They brought along a three-year-old bull
1SA.1.25	After sacrificing the bull, they brought the boy to Eli. 
1SA.1.26	“Sir, do you remember me?” Hannah asked. “I am the very woman who stood here several years ago praying to the 
1SA.1.27	I asked the

1SA.2.12	Now the sons of Eli were scoundrels who had no respect for the 
1SA.2.13	or for their duties as priests. Whenever anyone offered a sacrifice, Eli’s sons would send over a servant with a three-pronged fork. While the meat of the sacrificed animal was still boiling, 
1SA.2.14	the servant would stick the fork into the pot and demand that whatever it brought up be given to Eli’s sons. All the Israelites who came to worship at Shiloh were treated this way. 
1SA.2.15	Sometimes the servant would come even before the animal’s fat had been burned on the altar. He would demand raw meat before it had been boiled so that it could be used for roasting.
1SA.2.16	The man offering the sacrifice might reply, “Take as much as you want, but the fat must be burned first.” Then the servant would demand, “No, give it to me now, or I’ll take it by force.” 
1SA.2.17	So the sin of these young men was very serious in the 
1SA.2.18	But Samuel, though he was only a boy, served the 
1SA.2.19	Each year his mother made a small coat for him and brought it to him when she came with her husband for the sacrifice. 
1SA.2.20	Before they returned home, Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May the 
1SA.2.21	And the 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old, but he was aware of what his sons were doing to the people of Israel. He knew, for instance, that his sons were seducing the young women who assisted at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
1SA.2.23	Eli said to them, “I have been hearing reports from all the people about the wicked things you are doing. Why do you keep sinning? 
1SA.2.24	You must stop, my sons! The reports I hear among the 
1SA.2.25	If someone sins against another person, God
1SA.2.26	Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew taller and grew in favor with the 
1SA.2.27	One day a man of God came to Eli and gave him this message from the 
1SA.2.28	I chose your ancestor Aaron
1SA.2.29	So why do you scorn my sacrifices and offerings? Why do you give your sons more honor than you give me—for you and they have become fat from the best offerings of my people Israel!
1SA.2.30	“Therefore, the 
1SA.2.31	The time is coming when I will put an end to your family, so it will no longer serve as my priests. All the members of your family will die before their time. None will reach old age. 
1SA.2.32	You will watch with envy as I pour out prosperity on the people of Israel. But no members of your family will ever live out their days. 
1SA.2.33	The few not cut off from serving at my altar will survive, but only so their eyes can go blind and their hearts break, and their children will die a violent death.
1SA.2.34	And to prove that what I have said will come true, I will cause your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, to die on the same day!
1SA.2.35	“Then I will raise up a faithful priest who will serve me and do what I desire. I will establish his family, and they will be priests to my anointed kings forever. 
1SA.2.36	Then all of your surviving family will bow before him, begging for money and food. ‘Please,’ they will say, ‘give us jobs among the priests so we will have enough to eat.’”
1SA.3.1	Meanwhile, the boy Samuel served the 
1SA.3.2	One night Eli, who was almost blind by now, had gone to bed. 
1SA.3.3	The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was sleeping in the Tabernacle
1SA.3.4	Suddenly the 
1SA.3.4	“Yes?” Samuel replied. “What is it?” 
1SA.3.5	He got up and ran to Eli. “Here I am. Did you call me?”
1SA.3.5	“I didn’t call you,” Eli replied. “Go back to bed.” So he did.
1SA.3.6	Then the 
1SA.3.6	Again Samuel got up and went to Eli. “Here I am. Did you call me?”
1SA.3.6	“I didn’t call you, my son,” Eli said. “Go back to bed.”
1SA.3.7	Samuel did not yet know the 
1SA.3.8	So the 
1SA.3.8	Then Eli realized it was the 
1SA.3.9	So he said to Samuel, “Go and lie down again, and if someone calls again, say, ‘Speak, 
1SA.3.10	And the 
1SA.3.10	And Samuel replied, “Speak, your servant is listening.”
1SA.3.11	Then the 
1SA.3.12	I am going to carry out all my threats against Eli and his family, from beginning to end. 
1SA.3.13	I have warned him that judgment is coming upon his family forever, because his sons are blaspheming God
1SA.3.14	So I have vowed that the sins of Eli and his sons will never be forgiven by sacrifices or offerings.”
1SA.3.15	Samuel stayed in bed until morning, then got up and opened the doors of the Tabernacle
1SA.3.16	But Eli called out to him, “Samuel, my son.”
1SA.3.16	“Here I am,” Samuel replied.
1SA.3.17	“What did the 
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told Eli everything; he didn’t hold anything back. “It is the 
1SA.3.19	As Samuel grew up, the 
1SA.3.20	And all Israel, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the 
1SA.3.21	The 
1SA.3.22	And Samuel’s words went out to all the people of Israel.
1SA.4.2	The Philistines attacked and defeated the army of Israel, killing 4,000 men. 
1SA.4.3	After the battle was over, the troops retreated to their camp, and the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the 
1SA.4.4	So they sent men to Shiloh to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the 
1SA.4.5	When all the Israelites saw the Ark of the Covenant of the 
1SA.4.6	“What’s going on?” the Philistines asked. “What’s all the shouting about in the Hebrew camp?” When they were told it was because the Ark of the 
1SA.4.7	they panicked. “The gods have
1SA.4.8	Help! Who can save us from these mighty gods of Israel? They are the same gods who destroyed the Egyptians with plagues when Israel was in the wilderness. 
1SA.4.9	Fight as never before, Philistines! If you don’t, we will become the Hebrews’ slaves just as they have been ours! Stand up like men and fight!”
1SA.4.10	So the Philistines fought desperately, and Israel was defeated again. The slaughter was great; 30,000 Israelite soldiers died that day. The survivors turned and fled to their tents. 
1SA.4.11	The Ark of God was captured, and Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were killed.
1SA.4.12	A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefield and arrived at Shiloh later that same day. He had torn his clothes and put dust on his head to show his grief. 
1SA.4.13	Eli was waiting beside the road to hear the news of the battle, for his heart trembled for the safety of the Ark of God. When the messenger arrived and told what had happened, an outcry resounded throughout the town.
1SA.4.14	“What is all the noise about?” Eli asked.
1SA.4.14	The messenger rushed over to Eli, 
1SA.4.15	who was ninety-eight years old and blind. 
1SA.4.16	He said to Eli, “I have just come from the battlefield—I was there this very day.”
1SA.4.16	“What happened, my son?” Eli demanded.
1SA.4.17	“Israel has been defeated by the Philistines,” the messenger replied. “The people have been slaughtered, and your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were also killed. And the Ark of God has been captured.”
1SA.4.18	When the messenger mentioned what had happened to the Ark of God, Eli fell backward from his seat beside the gate. He broke his neck and died, for he was old and overweight. He had been Israel’s judge for forty years.
1SA.4.19	Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near her time of delivery. When she heard that the Ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth. 
1SA.4.20	She died in childbirth, but before she passed away the midwives tried to encourage her. “Don’t be afraid,” they said. “You have a baby boy!” But she did not answer or pay attention to them.
1SA.4.21	She named the child Ichabod (which means “Where is the glory?”), for she said, “Israel’s glory is gone.” She named him this because the Ark of God had been captured and because her father-in-law and husband were dead. 
1SA.4.22	Then she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the Ark of God has been captured.”
1SA.5.1	After the Philistines captured the Ark of God, they took it from the battleground at Ebenezer to the town of Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	They carried the Ark of God into the temple of Dagon and placed it beside an idol of Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	But when the citizens of Ashdod went to see it the next morning, Dagon had fallen with his face to the ground in front of the Ark of the 
1SA.5.4	But the next morning the same thing happened—Dagon had fallen face down before the Ark of the 
1SA.5.5	That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor anyone who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod will step on its threshold.
1SA.5.6	Then the 
1SA.5.7	When the people realized what was happening, they cried out, “We can’t keep the Ark of the God of Israel here any longer! He is against us! We will all be destroyed along with Dagon, our god.” 
1SA.5.8	So they called together the rulers of the Philistine towns and asked, “What should we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?”
1SA.5.8	The rulers discussed it and replied, “Move it to the town of Gath.” So they moved the Ark of the God of Israel to Gath. 
1SA.5.9	But when the Ark arrived at Gath, the 
1SA.5.10	So they sent the Ark of God to the town of Ekron, but when the people of Ekron saw it coming they cried out, “They are bringing the Ark of the God of Israel here to kill us, too!” 
1SA.5.11	The people summoned the Philistine rulers again and begged them, “Please send the Ark of the God of Israel back to its own country, or it
1SA.5.12	Those who didn’t die were afflicted with tumors; and the cry from the town rose to heaven.
1SA.6.1	The Ark of the 
1SA.6.2	Then the Philistines called in their priests and diviners and asked them, “What should we do about the Ark of the 
1SA.6.3	“Send the Ark of the God of Israel back with a gift,” they were told. “Send a guilt offering so the plague will stop. Then, if you are healed, you will know it was his hand that caused the plague.”
1SA.6.4	“What sort of guilt offering should we send?” they asked.
1SA.6.4	And they were told, “Since the plague has struck both you and your five rulers, make five gold tumors and five gold rats, just like those that have ravaged your land. 
1SA.6.5	Make these things to show honor to the God of Israel. Perhaps then he will stop afflicting you, your gods, and your land. 
1SA.6.6	Don’t be stubborn and rebellious as Pharaoh and the Egyptians were. By the time God was finished with them, they were eager to let Israel go.
1SA.6.7	“Now build a new cart, and find two cows that have just given birth to calves. Make sure the cows have never been yoked to a cart. Hitch the cows to the cart, but shut their calves away from them in a pen. 
1SA.6.8	Put the Ark of the 
1SA.6.9	If they cross the border of our land and go to Beth-shemesh, we will know it was the 
1SA.6.10	So these instructions were carried out. Two cows were hitched to the cart, and their newborn calves were shut up in a pen. 
1SA.6.11	Then the Ark of the 
1SA.6.12	And sure enough, without veering off in other directions, the cows went straight along the road toward Beth-shemesh, lowing as they went. The Philistine rulers followed them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.
1SA.6.13	The people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they saw the Ark, they were overjoyed! 
1SA.6.14	The cart came into the field of a man named Joshua and stopped beside a large rock. So the people broke up the wood of the cart for a fire and killed the cows and sacrificed them to the 
1SA.6.15	Several men of the tribe of Levi lifted the Ark of the 
1SA.6.16	The five Philistine rulers watched all this and then returned to Ekron that same day.
1SA.6.17	The five gold tumors sent by the Philistines as a guilt offering to the 
1SA.6.18	The five gold rats represented the five Philistine towns and their surrounding villages, which were controlled by the five rulers. The large rock
1SA.6.19	But the 
1SA.6.20	“Who is able to stand in the presence of the 
1SA.6.21	So they sent messengers to the people at Kiriath-jearim and told them, “The Philistines have returned the Ark of the 
1SA.7.1	So the men of Kiriath-jearim came to get the Ark of the 
1SA.7.2	The Ark remained in Kiriath-jearim for a long time—twenty years in all. During that time all Israel mourned because it seemed the 
1SA.7.3	Then Samuel said to all the people of Israel, “If you want to return to the 
1SA.7.4	So the Israelites got rid of their images of Baal and Ashtoreth and worshiped only the 
1SA.7.5	Then Samuel told them, “Gather all of Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the 
1SA.7.6	So they gathered at Mizpah and, in a great ceremony, drew water from a well and poured it out before the 
1SA.7.7	When the Philistine rulers heard that Israel had gathered at Mizpah, they mobilized their army and advanced. The Israelites were badly frightened when they learned that the Philistines were approaching. 
1SA.7.8	“Don’t stop pleading with the 
1SA.7.9	So Samuel took a young lamb and offered it to the 
1SA.7.10	Just as Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines arrived to attack Israel. But the 
1SA.7.11	The men of Israel chased them from Mizpah to a place below Beth-car, slaughtering them all along the way.
1SA.7.12	Samuel then took a large stone and placed it between the towns of Mizpah and Jeshanah.
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued and didn’t invade Israel again for some time. And throughout Samuel’s lifetime, the 
1SA.7.14	The Israelite villages near Ekron and Gath that the Philistines had captured were restored to Israel, along with the rest of the territory that the Philistines had taken. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites in those days.
1SA.7.15	Samuel continued as Israel’s judge for the rest of his life. 
1SA.7.16	Each year he traveled around, setting up his court first at Bethel, then at Gilgal, and then at Mizpah. He judged the people of Israel at each of these places. 
1SA.7.17	Then he would return to his home at Ramah, and he would hear cases there, too. And Samuel built an altar to the 
1SA.8.1	As Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	Joel and Abijah, his oldest sons, held court in Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	But they were not like their father, for they were greedy for money. They accepted bribes and perverted justice.
1SA.8.4	Finally, all the elders of Israel met at Ramah to discuss the matter with Samuel. 
1SA.8.5	“Look,” they told him, “you are now old, and your sons are not like you. Give us a king to judge us like all the other nations have.”
1SA.8.6	Samuel was displeased with their request and went to the 
1SA.8.7	“Do everything they say to you,” the 
1SA.8.8	Ever since I brought them from Egypt they have continually abandoned me and followed other gods. And now they are giving you the same treatment. 
1SA.8.9	Do as they ask, but solemnly warn them about the way a king will reign over them.”
1SA.8.10	So Samuel passed on the 
1SA.8.11	“This is how a king will reign over you,” Samuel said. “The king will draft your sons and assign them to his chariots and his charioteers, making them run before his chariots. 
1SA.8.12	Some will be generals and captains in his army,
1SA.8.13	The king will take your daughters from you and force them to cook and bake and make perfumes for him. 
1SA.8.14	He will take away the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his own officials. 
1SA.8.15	He will take a tenth of your grain and your grape harvest and distribute it among his officers and attendants. 
1SA.8.16	He will take your male and female slaves and demand the finest of your cattle
1SA.8.17	He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you will be his slaves. 
1SA.8.18	When that day comes, you will beg for relief from this king you are demanding, but then the 
1SA.8.19	But the people refused to listen to Samuel’s warning. “Even so, we still want a king,” they said. 
1SA.8.20	“We want to be like the nations around us. Our king will judge us and lead us into battle.”
1SA.8.21	So Samuel repeated to the 
1SA.8.22	and the 
1SA.9.1	There was a wealthy, influential man named Kish from the tribe of Benjamin. He was the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, of the tribe of Benjamin. 
1SA.9.2	His son Saul was the most handsome man in Israel—head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the land.
1SA.9.3	One day Kish’s donkeys strayed away, and he told Saul, “Take a servant with you, and go look for the donkeys.” 
1SA.9.4	So Saul took one of the servants and traveled through the hill country of Ephraim, the land of Shalishah, the Shaalim area, and the entire land of Benjamin, but they couldn’t find the donkeys anywhere.
1SA.9.5	Finally, they entered the region of Zuph, and Saul said to his servant, “Let’s go home. By now my father will be more worried about us than about the donkeys!”
1SA.9.6	But the servant said, “I’ve just thought of something! There is a man of God who lives here in this town. He is held in high honor by all the people because everything he says comes true. Let’s go find him. Perhaps he can tell us which way to go.”
1SA.9.7	“But we don’t have anything to offer him,” Saul replied. “Even our food is gone, and we don’t have a thing to give him.”
1SA.9.8	“Well,” the servant said, “I have one small silver piece.
1SA.9.9	(In those days if people wanted a message from God, they would say, “Let’s go and ask the seer,” for prophets used to be called seers.)
1SA.9.10	“All right,” Saul agreed, “let’s try it!” So they started into the town where the man of God lived.
1SA.9.11	As they were climbing the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water. So Saul and his servant asked, “Is the seer here today?”
1SA.9.12	“Yes,” they replied. “Stay right on this road. He is at the town gates. He has just arrived to take part in a public sacrifice up at the place of worship. 
1SA.9.13	Hurry and catch him before he goes up there to eat. The guests won’t begin eating until he arrives to bless the food.”
1SA.9.14	So they entered the town, and as they passed through the gates, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the place of worship.
1SA.9.15	Now the 
1SA.9.16	“About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him to be the leader of my people, Israel. He will rescue them from the Philistines, for I have looked down on my people in mercy and have heard their cry.”
1SA.9.17	When Samuel saw Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Just then Saul approached Samuel at the gateway and asked, “Can you please tell me where the seer’s house is?”
1SA.9.19	“I am the seer!” Samuel replied. “Go up to the place of worship ahead of me. We will eat there together, and in the morning I’ll tell you what you want to know and send you on your way. 
1SA.9.20	And don’t worry about those donkeys that were lost three days ago, for they have been found. And I am here to tell you that you and your family are the focus of all Israel’s hopes.”
1SA.9.21	Saul replied, “But I’m only from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe in Israel, and my family is the least important of all the families of that tribe! Why are you talking like this to me?”
1SA.9.22	Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and placed them at the head of the table, honoring them above the thirty special guests. 
1SA.9.23	Samuel then instructed the cook to bring Saul the finest cut of meat, the piece that had been set aside for the guest of honor. 
1SA.9.24	So the cook brought in the meat and placed it before Saul. “Go ahead and eat it,” Samuel said. “I was saving it for you even before I invited these others!” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
1SA.9.25	When they came down from the place of worship and returned to town, Samuel took Saul up to the roof of the house and prepared a bed for him there.
1SA.9.26	At daybreak the next morning, Samuel called to Saul, “Get up! It’s time you were on your way.” So Saul got ready, and he and Samuel left the house together. 
1SA.9.27	When they reached the edge of town, Samuel told Saul to send his servant on ahead. After the servant was gone, Samuel said, “Stay here, for I have received a special message for you from God.”
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it over Saul’s head. He kissed Saul and said, “I am doing this because the 
1SA.10.2	When you leave me today, you will see two men beside Rachel’s tomb at Zelzah, on the border of Benjamin. They will tell you that the donkeys have been found and that your father has stopped worrying about them and is now worried about you. He is asking, ‘Have you seen my son?’
1SA.10.3	“When you get to the oak of Tabor, you will see three men coming toward you who are on their way to worship God at Bethel. One will be bringing three young goats, another will have three loaves of bread, and the third will be carrying a wineskin full of wine. 
1SA.10.4	They will greet you and offer you two of the loaves, which you are to accept.
1SA.10.5	“When you arrive at Gibeah of God,
1SA.10.6	At that time the Spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	After these signs take place, do what must be done, for God is with you. 
1SA.10.8	Then go down to Gilgal ahead of me. I will join you there to sacrifice burnt offerings and peace offerings. You must wait for seven days until I arrive and give you further instructions.”
1SA.10.9	As Saul turned and started to leave, God gave him a new heart, and all Samuel’s signs were fulfilled that day. 
1SA.10.10	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, they saw a group of prophets coming toward them. Then the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul, and he, too, began to prophesy. 
1SA.10.11	When those who knew Saul heard about it, they exclaimed, “What? Is even Saul a prophet? How did the son of Kish become a prophet?”
1SA.10.12	And one of those standing there said, “Can anyone become a prophet, no matter who his father is?”
1SA.10.13	When Saul had finished prophesying, he went up to the place of worship. 
1SA.10.14	“Where have you been?” Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant.
1SA.10.14	“We were looking for the donkeys,” Saul replied, “but we couldn’t find them. So we went to Samuel to ask him where they were.”
1SA.10.15	“Oh? And what did he say?” his uncle asked.
1SA.10.16	“He told us that the donkeys had already been found,” Saul replied. But Saul didn’t tell his uncle what Samuel said about the kingdom.
1SA.10.17	Later Samuel called all the people of Israel to meet before the 
1SA.10.18	And he said, “This is what the 
1SA.10.19	But though I have rescued you from your misery and distress, you have rejected your God today and have said, ‘No, we want a king instead!’ Now, therefore, present yourselves before the 
1SA.10.20	So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel before the 
1SA.10.21	Then he brought each family of the tribe of Benjamin before the 
1SA.10.22	So they asked the 
1SA.10.22	And the 
1SA.10.23	So they found him and brought him out, and he stood head and shoulders above anyone else.
1SA.10.24	Then Samuel said to all the people, “This is the man the 
1SA.10.24	And all the people shouted, “Long live the king!”
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel told the people what the rights and duties of a king were. He wrote them down on a scroll and placed it before the 
1SA.10.26	When Saul returned to his home at Gibeah, a group of men whose hearts God had touched went with him. 
1SA.10.27	But there were some scoundrels who complained, “How can this man save us?” And they scorned him and refused to bring him gifts. But Saul ignored them.
1SA.10.27	[Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the people of Gad and Reuben who lived east of the Jordan River. He gouged out the right eye of each of the Israelites living there, and he didn’t allow anyone to come and rescue them. In fact, of all the Israelites east of the Jordan, there wasn’t a single one whose right eye Nahash had not gouged out. But there were 7,000 men who had escaped from the Ammonites, and they had settled in Jabesh-gilead.]
1SA.11.1	About a month later,
1SA.11.2	“All right,” Nahash said, “but only on one condition. I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you as a disgrace to all Israel!”
1SA.11.3	“Give us seven days to send messengers throughout Israel!” replied the elders of Jabesh. “If no one comes to save us, we will agree to your terms.”
1SA.11.4	When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the people about their plight, everyone broke into tears. 
1SA.11.5	Saul had been plowing a field with his oxen, and when he returned to town, he asked, “What’s the matter? Why is everyone crying?” So they told him about the message from Jabesh.
1SA.11.6	Then the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul, and he became very angry. 
1SA.11.7	He took two oxen and cut them into pieces and sent the messengers to carry them throughout Israel with this message: “This is what will happen to the oxen of anyone who refuses to follow Saul and Samuel into battle!” And the 
1SA.11.8	When Saul mobilized them at Bezek, he found that there were 300,000 men from Israel and 30,000
1SA.11.9	So Saul sent the messengers back to Jabesh-gilead to say, “We will rescue you by noontime tomorrow!” There was great joy throughout the town when that message arrived!
1SA.11.10	The men of Jabesh then told their enemies, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you can do to us whatever you wish.” 
1SA.11.11	But before dawn the next morning, Saul arrived, having divided his army into three detachments. He launched a surprise attack against the Ammonites and slaughtered them the whole morning. The remnant of their army was so badly scattered that no two of them were left together.
1SA.11.12	Then the people exclaimed to Samuel, “Now where are those men who said, ‘Why should Saul rule over us?’ Bring them here, and we will kill them!”
1SA.11.13	But Saul replied, “No one will be executed today, for today the 
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us all go to Gilgal to renew the kingdom.” 
1SA.11.15	So they all went to Gilgal, and in a solemn ceremony before the 
1SA.12.1	Then Samuel addressed all Israel: “I have done as you asked and given you a king. 
1SA.12.2	Your king is now your leader. I stand here before you—an old, gray-haired man—and my sons serve you. I have served as your leader from the time I was a boy to this very day. 
1SA.12.3	Now testify against me in the presence of the 
1SA.12.4	“No,” they replied, “you have never cheated or oppressed us, and you have never taken even a single bribe.”
1SA.12.5	“The 
1SA.12.5	“Yes, he is a witness,” they replied.
1SA.12.6	“It was the 
1SA.12.7	Now stand here quietly before the 
1SA.12.8	“When the Israelites were
1SA.12.9	But the people soon forgot about the 
1SA.12.10	“Then they cried to the 
1SA.12.11	Then the 
1SA.12.12	“But when you were afraid of Nahash, the king of Ammon, you came to me and said that you wanted a king to reign over you, even though the 
1SA.12.13	All right, here is the king you have chosen. You asked for him, and the 
1SA.12.14	“Now if you fear and worship the 
1SA.12.15	But if you rebel against the 
1SA.12.16	“Now stand here and see the great thing the 
1SA.12.17	You know that it does not rain at this time of the year during the wheat harvest. I will ask the 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called to the 
1SA.12.19	“Pray to the 
1SA.12.20	“Don’t be afraid,” Samuel reassured them. “You have certainly done wrong, but make sure now that you worship the 
1SA.12.21	Don’t go back to worshiping worthless idols that cannot help or rescue you—they are totally useless! 
1SA.12.22	The 
1SA.12.23	“As for me, I will certainly not sin against the 
1SA.12.24	But be sure to fear the 
1SA.12.25	But if you continue to sin, you and your king will be swept away.”
1SA.13.1	Saul was thirty
1SA.13.2	Saul selected 3,000 special troops from the army of Israel and sent the rest of the men home. He took 2,000 of the chosen men with him to Micmash and the hill country of Bethel. The other 1,000 went with Saul’s son Jonathan to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin.
1SA.13.3	Soon after this, Jonathan attacked and defeated the garrison of Philistines at Geba. The news spread quickly among the Philistines. So Saul blew the ram’s horn throughout the land, saying, “Hebrews, hear this! Rise up in revolt!” 
1SA.13.4	All Israel heard the news that Saul had destroyed the Philistine garrison at Geba and that the Philistines now hated the Israelites more than ever. So the entire Israelite army was summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	The Philistines mustered a mighty army of 3,000
1SA.13.6	The men of Israel saw what a tight spot they were in; and because they were hard pressed by the enemy, they tried to hide in caves, thickets, rocks, holes, and cisterns. 
1SA.13.7	Some of them crossed the Jordan River and escaped into the land of Gad and Gilead.
1SA.13.7	Meanwhile, Saul stayed at Gilgal, and his men were trembling with fear. 
1SA.13.8	Saul waited there seven days for Samuel, as Samuel had instructed him earlier, but Samuel still didn’t come. Saul realized that his troops were rapidly slipping away. 
1SA.13.9	So he demanded, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings!” And Saul sacrificed the burnt offering himself.
1SA.13.10	Just as Saul was finishing with the burnt offering, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to meet and welcome him, 
1SA.13.11	but Samuel said, “What is this you have done?”
1SA.13.11	Saul replied, “I saw my men scattering from me, and you didn’t arrive when you said you would, and the Philistines are at Micmash ready for battle. 
1SA.13.12	So I said, ‘The Philistines are ready to march against us at Gilgal, and I haven’t even asked for the 
1SA.13.13	“How foolish!” Samuel exclaimed. “You have not kept the command the 
1SA.13.14	But now your kingdom must end, for the 
1SA.13.15	Samuel then left Gilgal and went on his way, but the rest of the troops went with Saul to meet the army. They went up from Gilgal to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin.
1SA.13.16	Saul and Jonathan and the troops with them were staying at Geba in the land of Benjamin. The Philistines set up their camp at Micmash. 
1SA.13.17	Three raiding parties soon left the camp of the Philistines. One went north toward Ophrah in the land of Shual, 
1SA.13.18	another went west to Beth-horon, and the third moved toward the border above the valley of Zeboim near the wilderness.
1SA.13.19	There were no blacksmiths in the land of Israel in those days. The Philistines wouldn’t allow them for fear they would make swords and spears for the Hebrews. 
1SA.13.20	So whenever the Israelites needed to sharpen their plowshares, picks, axes, or sickles,
1SA.13.21	The charges were as follows: a quarter of an ounce
1SA.13.22	So on the day of the battle none of the people of Israel had a sword or spear, except for Saul and Jonathan.
1SA.13.23	The pass at Micmash had meanwhile been secured by a contingent of the Philistine army.
1SA.14.1	One day Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come on, let’s go over to where the Philistines have their outpost.” But Jonathan did not tell his father what he was doing.
1SA.14.2	Meanwhile, Saul and his 600 men were camped on the outskirts of Gibeah, around the pomegranate tree
1SA.14.3	Among Saul’s men was Ahijah the priest, who was wearing the ephod, the priestly vest. Ahijah was the son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the 
1SA.14.3	No one realized that Jonathan had left the Israelite camp. 
1SA.14.4	To reach the Philistine outpost, Jonathan had to go down between two rocky cliffs that were called Bozez and Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	The cliff on the north was in front of Micmash, and the one on the south was in front of Geba. 
1SA.14.6	“Let’s go across to the outpost of those pagans,” Jonathan said to his armor bearer. “Perhaps the 
1SA.14.7	“Do what you think is best,” the armor bearer replied. “I’m with you completely, whatever you decide.”
1SA.14.8	“All right, then,” Jonathan told him. “We will cross over and let them see us. 
1SA.14.9	If they say to us, ‘Stay where you are or we’ll kill you,’ then we will stop and not go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say, ‘Come on up and fight,’ then we will go up. That will be the 
1SA.14.11	When the Philistines saw them coming, they shouted, “Look! The Hebrews are crawling out of their holes!” 
1SA.14.12	Then the men from the outpost shouted to Jonathan, “Come on up here, and we’ll teach you a lesson!”
1SA.14.12	“Come on, climb right behind me,” Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “for the 
1SA.14.13	So they climbed up using both hands and feet, and the Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer killed those who came behind them. 
1SA.14.14	They killed some twenty men in all, and their bodies were scattered over about half an acre.
1SA.14.15	Suddenly, panic broke out in the Philistine army, both in the camp and in the field, including even the outposts and raiding parties. And just then an earthquake struck, and everyone was terrified.
1SA.14.16	Saul’s lookouts in Gibeah of Benjamin saw a strange sight—the vast army of Philistines began to melt away in every direction.
1SA.14.17	“Call the roll and find out who’s missing,” Saul ordered. And when they checked, they found that Jonathan and his armor bearer were gone.
1SA.14.18	Then Saul shouted to Ahijah, “Bring the ephod here!” For at that time Ahijah was wearing the ephod in front of the Israelites.
1SA.14.19	But while Saul was talking to the priest, the confusion in the Philistine camp grew louder and louder. So Saul said to the priest, “Never mind; let’s get going!”
1SA.14.20	Then Saul and all his men rushed out to the battle and found the Philistines killing each other. There was terrible confusion everywhere. 
1SA.14.21	Even the Hebrews who had previously gone over to the Philistine army revolted and joined in with Saul, Jonathan, and the rest of the Israelites. 
1SA.14.22	Likewise, the men of Israel who were hiding in the hill country of Ephraim joined the chase when they saw the Philistines running away. 
1SA.14.23	So the 
1SA.14.24	Now the men of Israel were pressed to exhaustion that day, because Saul had placed them under an oath, saying, “Let a curse fall on anyone who eats before evening—before I have full revenge on my enemies.” So no one ate anything all day, 
1SA.14.25	even though they had all found honeycomb on the ground in the forest. 
1SA.14.26	They didn’t dare touch the honey because they all feared the oath they had taken.
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan had not heard his father’s command, and he dipped the end of his stick into a piece of honeycomb and ate the honey. After he had eaten it, he felt refreshed.
1SA.14.28	But one of the men saw him and said, “Your father made the army take a strict oath that anyone who eats food today will be cursed. That is why everyone is weary and faint.”
1SA.14.29	“My father has made trouble for us all!” Jonathan exclaimed. “A command like that only hurts us. See how refreshed I am now that I have eaten this little bit of honey. 
1SA.14.30	If the men had been allowed to eat freely from the food they found among our enemies, think how many more Philistines we could have killed!”
1SA.14.31	They chased and killed the Philistines all day from Micmash to Aijalon, growing more and more faint. 
1SA.14.32	That evening they rushed for the battle plunder and butchered the sheep, goats, cattle, and calves, but they ate them without draining the blood. 
1SA.14.33	Someone reported to Saul, “Look, the men are sinning against the 
1SA.14.33	“That is very wrong,” Saul said. “Find a large stone and roll it over here. 
1SA.14.34	Then go out among the troops and tell them, ‘Bring the cattle, sheep, and goats here to me. Kill them here, and drain the blood before you eat them. Do not sin against the 
1SA.14.34	So that night all the troops brought their animals and slaughtered them there. 
1SA.14.35	Then Saul built an altar to the 
1SA.14.36	Then Saul said, “Let’s chase the Philistines all night and plunder them until sunrise. Let’s destroy every last one of them.”
1SA.14.36	His men replied, “We’ll do whatever you think is best.”
1SA.14.36	But the priest said, “Let’s ask God first.”
1SA.14.37	So Saul asked God, “Should we go after the Philistines? Will you help us defeat them?” But God made no reply that day.
1SA.14.38	Then Saul said to the leaders, “Something’s wrong! I want all my army commanders to come here. We must find out what sin was committed today. 
1SA.14.39	I vow by the name of the 
1SA.14.40	Then Saul said, “Jonathan and I will stand over here, and all of you stand over there.”
1SA.14.40	And the people responded to Saul, “Whatever you think is best.”
1SA.14.41	Then Saul prayed, “O 
1SA.14.42	Then Saul said, “Now cast lots again and choose between me and Jonathan.” And Jonathan was shown to be the guilty one.
1SA.14.43	“Tell me what you have done,” Saul demanded of Jonathan.
1SA.14.43	“I tasted a little honey,” Jonathan admitted. “It was only a little bit on the end of my stick. Does that deserve death?”
1SA.14.44	“Yes, Jonathan,” Saul said, “you must die! May God strike me and even kill me if you do not die for this.”
1SA.14.45	But the people broke in and said to Saul, “Jonathan has won this great victory for Israel. Should he die? Far from it! As surely as the 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul called back the army from chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines returned home.
1SA.14.47	Now when Saul had secured his grasp on Israel’s throne, he fought against his enemies in every direction—against Moab, Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. And wherever he turned, he was victorious.
1SA.14.48	He performed great deeds and conquered the Amalekites, saving Israel from all those who had plundered them.
1SA.14.49	Saul’s sons included Jonathan, Ishbosheth,
1SA.14.50	Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. The commander of Saul’s army was Abner, the son of Saul’s uncle Ner. 
1SA.14.51	Saul’s father, Kish, and Abner’s father, Ner, were both sons of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	The Israelites fought constantly with the Philistines throughout Saul’s lifetime. So whenever Saul observed a young man who was brave and strong, he drafted him into his army.
1SA.15.1	One day Samuel said to Saul, “It was the 
1SA.15.2	This is what the 
1SA.15.3	Now go and completely destroy
1SA.15.4	So Saul mobilized his army at Telaim. There were 200,000 soldiers from Israel and 10,000 men from Judah. 
1SA.15.5	Then Saul and his army went to a town of the Amalekites and lay in wait in the valley. 
1SA.15.6	Saul sent this warning to the Kenites: “Move away from where the Amalekites live, or you will die with them. For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites packed up and left.
1SA.15.7	Then Saul slaughtered the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, east of Egypt. 
1SA.15.8	He captured Agag, the Amalekite king, but completely destroyed everyone else. 
1SA.15.9	Saul and his men spared Agag’s life and kept the best of the sheep and goats, the cattle, the fat calves, and the lambs—everything, in fact, that appealed to them. They destroyed only what was worthless or of poor quality.
1SA.15.10	Then the 
1SA.15.11	“I am sorry that I ever made Saul king, for he has not been loyal to me and has refused to obey my command.” Samuel was so deeply moved when he heard this that he cried out to the 
1SA.15.12	Early the next morning Samuel went to find Saul. Someone told him, “Saul went to the town of Carmel to set up a monument to himself; then he went on to Gilgal.”
1SA.15.13	When Samuel finally found him, Saul greeted him cheerfully. “May the 
1SA.15.14	“Then what is all the bleating of sheep and goats and the lowing of cattle I hear?” Samuel demanded.
1SA.15.15	“It’s true that the army spared the best of the sheep, goats, and cattle,” Saul admitted. “But they are going to sacrifice them to the 
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop! Listen to what the 
1SA.15.16	“What did he tell you?” Saul asked.
1SA.15.17	And Samuel told him, “Although you may think little of yourself, are you not the leader of the tribes of Israel? The 
1SA.15.18	And the 
1SA.15.19	Why haven’t you obeyed the 
1SA.15.20	“But I did obey the 
1SA.15.21	Then my troops brought in the best of the sheep, goats, cattle, and plunder to sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.22	But Samuel replied, 
1SA.15.22	“What is more pleasing to the 
1SA.15.22	your burnt offerings and sacrifices
1SA.15.22	or your obedience to his voice?
1SA.15.22	Listen! Obedience is better than sacrifice,
1SA.15.22	and submission is better than offering the fat of rams.
1SA.15.23	Rebellion is as sinful as witchcraft,
1SA.15.23	and stubbornness as bad as worshiping idols.
1SA.15.23	So because you have rejected the command of the 
1SA.15.23	he has rejected you as king.”
1SA.15.24	Then Saul admitted to Samuel, “Yes, I have sinned. I have disobeyed your instructions and the 
1SA.15.25	But now, please forgive my sin and come back with me so that I may worship the 
1SA.15.26	But Samuel replied, “I will not go back with you! Since you have rejected the 
1SA.15.27	As Samuel turned to go, Saul tried to hold him back and tore the hem of his robe. 
1SA.15.28	And Samuel said to him, “The 
1SA.15.29	And he who is the Glory of Israel will not lie, nor will he change his mind, for he is not human that he should change his mind!”
1SA.15.30	Then Saul pleaded again, “I know I have sinned. But please, at least honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel by coming back with me so that I may worship the 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel finally agreed and went back with him, and Saul worshiped the 
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, “Bring King Agag to me.” Agag arrived full of hope, for he thought, “Surely the worst is over, and I have been spared!”
1SA.15.33	But Samuel said, “As your sword has killed the sons of many mothers, now your mother will be childless.” And Samuel cut Agag to pieces before the 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went home to Ramah, and Saul returned to his house at Gibeah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	Samuel never went to meet with Saul again, but he mourned constantly for him. And the 
1SA.16.1	Now the 
1SA.16.2	But Samuel asked, “How can I do that? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.”
1SA.16.2	“Take a heifer with you,” the 
1SA.16.3	Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you which of his sons to anoint for me.”
1SA.16.4	So Samuel did as the 
1SA.16.5	“Yes,” Samuel replied. “I have come to sacrifice to the 
1SA.16.6	When they arrived, Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought, “Surely this is the 
1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse told his son Abinadab to step forward and walk in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, “This is not the one the 
1SA.16.9	Next Jesse summoned Shimea,
1SA.16.10	In the same way all seven of Jesse’s sons were presented to Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The 
1SA.16.11	Then Samuel asked, “Are these all the sons you have?”
1SA.16.11	“There is still the youngest,” Jesse replied. “But he’s out in the fields watching the sheep and goats.”
1SA.16.11	“Send for him at once,” Samuel said. “We will not sit down to eat until he arrives.”
1SA.16.12	So Jesse sent for him. He was dark and handsome, with beautiful eyes.
1SA.16.12	And the 
1SA.16.13	So as David stood there among his brothers, Samuel took the flask of olive oil he had brought and anointed David with the oil. And the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.14	Now the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	Some of Saul’s servants said to him, “A tormenting spirit from God is troubling you. 
1SA.16.16	Let us find a good musician to play the harp whenever the tormenting spirit troubles you. He will play soothing music, and you will soon be well again.”
1SA.16.17	“All right,” Saul said. “Find me someone who plays well, and bring him here.”
1SA.16.18	One of the servants said to Saul, “One of Jesse’s sons from Bethlehem is a talented harp player. Not only that—he is a brave warrior, a man of war, and has good judgment. He is also a fine-looking young man, and the 
1SA.16.19	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse to say, “Send me your son David, the shepherd.” 
1SA.16.20	Jesse responded by sending David to Saul, along with a young goat, a donkey loaded with bread, and a wineskin full of wine.
1SA.16.21	So David went to Saul and began serving him. Saul loved David very much, and David became his armor bearer.
1SA.16.22	Then Saul sent word to Jesse asking, “Please let David remain in my service, for I am very pleased with him.”
1SA.16.23	And whenever the tormenting spirit from God troubled Saul, David would play the harp. Then Saul would feel better, and the tormenting spirit would go away.
1SA.17.1	The Philistines now mustered their army for battle and camped between Socoh in Judah and Azekah at Ephes-dammim. 
1SA.17.2	Saul countered by gathering his Israelite troops near the valley of Elah. 
1SA.17.3	So the Philistines and Israelites faced each other on opposite hills, with the valley between them.
1SA.17.4	Then Goliath, a Philistine champion from Gath, came out of the Philistine ranks to face the forces of Israel. He was over nine feet
1SA.17.5	He wore a bronze helmet, and his bronze coat of mail weighed 125 pounds.
1SA.17.6	He also wore bronze leg armor, and he carried a bronze javelin on his shoulder. 
1SA.17.7	The shaft of his spear was as heavy and thick as a weaver’s beam, tipped with an iron spearhead that weighed 15 pounds.
1SA.17.8	Goliath stood and shouted a taunt across to the Israelites. “Why are you all coming out to fight?” he called. “I am the Philistine champion, but you are only the servants of Saul. Choose one man to come down here and fight me! 
1SA.17.9	If he kills me, then we will be your slaves. But if I kill him, you will be our slaves! 
1SA.17.10	I defy the armies of Israel today! Send me a man who will fight me!” 
1SA.17.11	When Saul and the Israelites heard this, they were terrified and deeply shaken.
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of a man named Jesse, an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in the land of Judah. Jesse was an old man at that time, and he had eight sons. 
1SA.17.13	Jesse’s three oldest sons—Eliab, Abinadab, and Shimea
1SA.17.14	David was the youngest son. David’s three oldest brothers stayed with Saul’s army, 
1SA.17.15	but David went back and forth so he could help his father with the sheep in Bethlehem.
1SA.17.16	For forty days, every morning and evening, the Philistine champion strutted in front of the Israelite army.
1SA.17.17	One day Jesse said to David, “Take this basket
1SA.17.18	And give these ten cuts of cheese to their captain. See how your brothers are getting along, and bring back a report on how they are doing.
1SA.17.19	David’s brothers were with Saul and the Israelite army at the valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.
1SA.17.20	So David left the sheep with another shepherd and set out early the next morning with the gifts, as Jesse had directed him. He arrived at the camp just as the Israelite army was leaving for the battlefield with shouts and battle cries. 
1SA.17.21	Soon the Israelite and Philistine forces stood facing each other, army against army. 
1SA.17.22	David left his things with the keeper of supplies and hurried out to the ranks to greet his brothers. 
1SA.17.23	As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, came out from the Philistine ranks. Then David heard him shout his usual taunt to the army of Israel.
1SA.17.24	As soon as the Israelite army saw him, they began to run away in fright. 
1SA.17.25	“Have you seen the giant?” the men asked. “He comes out each day to defy Israel. The king has offered a huge reward to anyone who kills him. He will give that man one of his daughters for a wife, and the man’s entire family will be exempted from paying taxes!”
1SA.17.26	David asked the soldiers standing nearby, “What will a man get for killing this Philistine and ending his defiance of Israel? Who is this pagan Philistine anyway, that he is allowed to defy the armies of the living God?”
1SA.17.27	And these men gave David the same reply. They said, “Yes, that is the reward for killing him.”
1SA.17.28	But when David’s oldest brother, Eliab, heard David talking to the men, he was angry. “What are you doing around here anyway?” he demanded. “What about those few sheep you’re supposed to be taking care of? I know about your pride and deceit. You just want to see the battle!”
1SA.17.29	“What have I done now?” David replied. “I was only asking a question!” 
1SA.17.30	He walked over to some others and asked them the same thing and received the same answer. 
1SA.17.31	Then David’s question was reported to King Saul, and the king sent for him.
1SA.17.32	“Don’t worry about this Philistine,” David told Saul. “I’ll go fight him!”
1SA.17.33	“Don’t be ridiculous!” Saul replied. “There’s no way you can fight this Philistine and possibly win! You’re only a boy, and he’s been a man of war since his youth.”
1SA.17.34	But David persisted. “I have been taking care of my father’s sheep and goats,” he said. “When a lion or a bear comes to steal a lamb from the flock, 
1SA.17.35	I go after it with a club and rescue the lamb from its mouth. If the animal turns on me, I catch it by the jaw and club it to death. 
1SA.17.36	I have done this to both lions and bears, and I’ll do it to this pagan Philistine, too, for he has defied the armies of the living God! 
1SA.17.37	The 
1SA.17.37	Saul finally consented. “All right, go ahead,” he said. “And may the 
1SA.17.38	Then Saul gave David his own armor—a bronze helmet and a coat of mail. 
1SA.17.39	David put it on, strapped the sword over it, and took a step or two to see what it was like, for he had never worn such things before.
1SA.17.39	“I can’t go in these,” he protested to Saul. “I’m not used to them.” So David took them off again. 
1SA.17.40	He picked up five smooth stones from a stream and put them into his shepherd’s bag. Then, armed only with his shepherd’s staff and sling, he started across the valley to fight the Philistine.
1SA.17.41	Goliath walked out toward David with his shield bearer ahead of him, 
1SA.17.42	sneering in contempt at this ruddy-faced boy. 
1SA.17.43	“Am I a dog,” he roared at David, “that you come at me with a stick?” And he cursed David by the names of his gods. 
1SA.17.44	“Come over here, and I’ll give your flesh to the birds and wild animals!” Goliath yelled.
1SA.17.45	David replied to the Philistine, “You come to me with sword, spear, and javelin, but I come to you in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	Today the 
1SA.17.47	And everyone assembled here will know that the 
1SA.17.48	As Goliath moved closer to attack, David quickly ran out to meet him. 
1SA.17.49	Reaching into his shepherd’s bag and taking out a stone, he hurled it with his sling and hit the Philistine in the forehead. The stone sank in, and Goliath stumbled and fell face down on the ground.
1SA.17.50	So David triumphed over the Philistine with only a sling and a stone, for he had no sword. 
1SA.17.51	Then David ran over and pulled Goliath’s sword from its sheath. David used it to kill him and cut off his head.
1SA.17.51	When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they turned and ran. 
1SA.17.52	Then the men of Israel and Judah gave a great shout of triumph and rushed after the Philistines, chasing them as far as Gath
1SA.17.53	Then the Israelite army returned and plundered the deserted Philistine camp. 
1SA.17.54	(David took the Philistine’s head to Jerusalem, but he stored the man’s armor in his own tent.)
1SA.17.55	As Saul watched David go out to fight the Philistine, he asked Abner, the commander of his army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?”
1SA.17.55	“I really don’t know,” Abner declared.
1SA.17.56	“Well, find out who he is!” the king told him.
1SA.17.57	As soon as David returned from killing Goliath, Abner brought him to Saul with the Philistine’s head still in his hand. 
1SA.17.58	“Tell me about your father, young man,” Saul said.
1SA.17.58	And David replied, “His name is Jesse, and we live in Bethlehem.”
1SA.18.1	After David had finished talking with Saul, he met Jonathan, the king’s son. There was an immediate bond between them, for Jonathan loved David. 
1SA.18.2	From that day on Saul kept David with him and wouldn’t let him return home. 
1SA.18.3	And Jonathan made a solemn pact with David, because he loved him as he loved himself. 
1SA.18.4	Jonathan sealed the pact by taking off his robe and giving it to David, together with his tunic, sword, bow, and belt.
1SA.18.5	Whatever Saul asked David to do, David did it successfully. So Saul made him a commander over the men of war, an appointment that was welcomed by the people and Saul’s officers alike.
1SA.18.6	When the victorious Israelite army was returning home after David had killed the Philistine, women from all the towns of Israel came out to meet King Saul. They sang and danced for joy with tambourines and cymbals.
1SA.18.7	This was their song: 
1SA.18.7	“Saul has killed his thousands,
1SA.18.7	and David his ten thousands!”
1SA.18.8	This made Saul very angry. “What’s this?” he said. “They credit David with ten thousands and me with only thousands. Next they’ll be making him their king!” 
1SA.18.9	So from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.
1SA.18.10	The very next day a tormenting spirit
1SA.18.11	and he suddenly hurled it at David, intending to pin him to the wall. But David escaped him twice.
1SA.18.12	Saul was then afraid of David, for the 
1SA.18.13	Finally, Saul sent him away and appointed him commander over 1,000 men, and David faithfully led his troops into battle.
1SA.18.14	David continued to succeed in everything he did, for the 
1SA.18.15	When Saul recognized this, he became even more afraid of him. 
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David because he was so successful at leading his troops into battle.
1SA.18.17	One day Saul said to David, “I am ready to give you my older daughter, Merab, as your wife. But first you must prove yourself to be a real warrior by fighting the 
1SA.18.18	“Who am I, and what is my family in Israel that I should be the king’s son-in-law?” David exclaimed. “My father’s family is nothing!” 
1SA.18.19	So
1SA.18.20	In the meantime, Saul’s daughter Michal had fallen in love with David, and Saul was delighted when he heard about it. 
1SA.18.21	“Here’s another chance to see him killed by the Philistines!” Saul said to himself. But to David he said, “Today you have a second chance to become my son-in-law!”
1SA.18.22	Then Saul told his men to say to David, “The king really likes you, and so do we. Why don’t you accept the king’s offer and become his son-in-law?”
1SA.18.23	When Saul’s men said these things to David, he replied, “How can a poor man from a humble family afford the bride price for the daughter of a king?”
1SA.18.24	When Saul’s men reported this back to the king, 
1SA.18.25	he told them, “Tell David that all I want for the bride price is 100 Philistine foreskins! Vengeance on my enemies is all I really want.” But what Saul had in mind was that David would be killed in the fight.
1SA.18.26	David was delighted to accept the offer. Before the time limit expired, 
1SA.18.27	he and his men went out and killed 200 Philistines. Then David fulfilled the king’s requirement by presenting all their foreskins to him. So Saul gave his daughter Michal to David to be his wife.
1SA.18.28	When Saul realized that the 
1SA.18.29	Saul became even more afraid of him, and he remained David’s enemy for the rest of his life.
1SA.18.30	Every time the commanders of the Philistines attacked, David was more successful against them than all the rest of Saul’s officers. So David’s name became very famous.
1SA.19.1	Saul now urged his servants and his son Jonathan to assassinate David. But Jonathan, because of his strong affection for David, 
1SA.19.2	told him what his father was planning. “Tomorrow morning,” he warned him, “you must find a hiding place out in the fields. 
1SA.19.3	I’ll ask my father to go out there with me, and I’ll talk to him about you. Then I’ll tell you everything I can find out.”
1SA.19.4	The next morning Jonathan spoke with his father about David, saying many good things about him. “The king must not sin against his servant David,” Jonathan said. “He’s never done anything to harm you. He has always helped you in any way he could. 
1SA.19.5	Have you forgotten about the time he risked his life to kill the Philistine giant and how the 
1SA.19.6	So Saul listened to Jonathan and vowed, “As surely as the 
1SA.19.7	Afterward Jonathan called David and told him what had happened. Then he brought David to Saul, and David served in the court as before.
1SA.19.8	War broke out again after that, and David led his troops against the Philistines. He attacked them with such fury that they all ran away.
1SA.19.9	But one day when Saul was sitting at home, with spear in hand, the tormenting spirit
1SA.19.10	Saul hurled his spear at David. But David dodged out of the way, and leaving the spear stuck in the wall, he fled and escaped into the night.
1SA.19.11	Then Saul sent troops to watch David’s house. They were told to kill David when he came out the next morning. But Michal, David’s wife, warned him, “If you don’t escape tonight, you will be dead by morning.” 
1SA.19.12	So she helped him climb out through a window, and he fled and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	Then she took an idol
1SA.19.14	When the troops came to arrest David, she told them he was sick and couldn’t get out of bed.
1SA.19.15	But Saul sent the troops back to get David. He ordered, “Bring him to me in his bed so I can kill him!” 
1SA.19.16	But when they came to carry David out, they discovered that it was only an idol in the bed with a cushion of goat’s hair at its head.
1SA.19.17	“Why have you betrayed me like this and let my enemy escape?” Saul demanded of Michal.
1SA.19.17	“I had to,” Michal replied. “He threatened to kill me if I didn’t help him.”
1SA.19.18	So David escaped and went to Ramah to see Samuel, and he told him all that Saul had done to him. Then Samuel took David with him to live at Naioth. 
1SA.19.19	When the report reached Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah, 
1SA.19.20	he sent troops to capture him. But when they arrived and saw Samuel leading a group of prophets who were prophesying, the Spirit of God came upon Saul’s men, and they also began to prophesy. 
1SA.19.21	When Saul heard what had happened, he sent other troops, but they, too, prophesied! The same thing happened a third time. 
1SA.19.22	Finally, Saul himself went to Ramah and arrived at the great well in Secu. “Where are Samuel and David?” he demanded.
1SA.19.22	“They are at Naioth in Ramah,” someone told him.
1SA.19.23	But on the way to Naioth in Ramah the Spirit of God came even upon Saul, and he, too, began to prophesy all the way to Naioth! 
1SA.19.24	He tore off his clothes and lay naked on the ground all day and all night, prophesying in the presence of Samuel. The people who were watching exclaimed, “What? Is even Saul a prophet?”
1SA.20.1	David now fled from Naioth in Ramah and found Jonathan. “What have I done?” he exclaimed. “What is my crime? How have I offended your father that he is so determined to kill me?”
1SA.20.2	“That’s not true!” Jonathan protested. “You’re not going to die. He always tells me everything he’s going to do, even the little things. I know my father wouldn’t hide something like this from me. It just isn’t so!”
1SA.20.3	Then David took an oath before Jonathan and said, “Your father knows perfectly well about our friendship, so he has said to himself, ‘I won’t tell Jonathan—why should I hurt him?’ But I swear to you that I am only a step away from death! I swear it by the 
1SA.20.4	“Tell me what I can do to help you,” Jonathan exclaimed.
1SA.20.5	David replied, “Tomorrow we celebrate the new moon festival. I’ve always eaten with the king on this occasion, but tomorrow I’ll hide in the field and stay there until the evening of the third day. 
1SA.20.6	If your father asks where I am, tell him I asked permission to go home to Bethlehem for an annual family sacrifice. 
1SA.20.7	If he says, ‘Fine!’ you will know all is well. But if he is angry and loses his temper, you will know he is determined to kill me. 
1SA.20.8	Show me this loyalty as my sworn friend—for we made a solemn pact before the 
1SA.20.9	“Never!” Jonathan exclaimed. “You know that if I had the slightest notion my father was planning to kill you, I would tell you at once.”
1SA.20.10	Then David asked, “How will I know whether or not your father is angry?”
1SA.20.11	“Come out to the field with me,” Jonathan replied. And they went out there together. 
1SA.20.12	Then Jonathan told David, “I promise by the 
1SA.20.13	But if he is angry and wants you killed, may the 
1SA.20.14	And may you treat me with the faithful love of the 
1SA.20.15	treat my family with this faithful love, even when the 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made a solemn pact with David,
1SA.20.17	And Jonathan made David reaffirm his vow of friendship again, for Jonathan loved David as he loved himself.
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said, “Tomorrow we celebrate the new moon festival. You will be missed when your place at the table is empty. 
1SA.20.19	The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid before, and wait there by the stone pile.
1SA.20.20	I will come out and shoot three arrows to the side of the stone pile as though I were shooting at a target. 
1SA.20.21	Then I will send a boy to bring the arrows back. If you hear me tell him, ‘They’re on this side,’ then you will know, as surely as the 
1SA.20.22	But if I tell him, ‘Go farther—the arrows are still ahead of you,’ then it will mean that you must leave immediately, for the 
1SA.20.23	And may the 
1SA.20.24	So David hid himself in the field, and when the new moon festival began, the king sat down to eat. 
1SA.20.25	He sat at his usual place against the wall, with Jonathan sitting opposite him
1SA.20.26	Saul didn’t say anything about it that day, for he said to himself, “Something must have made David ceremonially unclean.” 
1SA.20.27	But when David’s place was empty again the next day, Saul asked Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse been here for the meal either yesterday or today?”
1SA.20.28	Jonathan replied, “David earnestly asked me if he could go to Bethlehem. 
1SA.20.29	He said, ‘Please let me go, for we are having a family sacrifice. My brother demanded that I be there. So please let me get away to see my brothers.’ That’s why he isn’t here at the king’s table.”
1SA.20.30	Saul boiled with rage at Jonathan. “You stupid son of a whore!”
1SA.20.31	As long as that son of Jesse is alive, you’ll never be king. Now go and get him so I can kill him!”
1SA.20.32	“But why should he be put to death?” Jonathan asked his father. “What has he done?” 
1SA.20.33	Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan, intending to kill him. So at last Jonathan realized that his father was really determined to kill David.
1SA.20.34	Jonathan left the table in fierce anger and refused to eat on that second day of the festival, for he was crushed by his father’s shameful behavior toward David.
1SA.20.35	The next morning, as agreed, Jonathan went out into the field and took a young boy with him to gather his arrows. 
1SA.20.36	“Start running,” he told the boy, “so you can find the arrows as I shoot them.” So the boy ran, and Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him. 
1SA.20.37	When the boy had almost reached the arrow, Jonathan shouted, “The arrow is still ahead of you. 
1SA.20.38	Hurry, hurry, don’t wait.” So the boy quickly gathered up the arrows and ran back to his master. 
1SA.20.39	He, of course, suspected nothing; only Jonathan and David understood the signal. 
1SA.20.40	Then Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him to take them back to town.
1SA.20.41	As soon as the boy was gone, David came out from where he had been hiding near the stone pile.
1SA.20.42	At last Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for we have sworn loyalty to each other in the 
1SA.21.1	David went to the town of Nob to see Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he saw him. “Why are you alone?” he asked. “Why is no one with you?”
1SA.21.2	“The king has sent me on a private matter,” David said. “He told me not to tell anyone why I am here. I have told my men where to meet me later. 
1SA.21.3	Now, what is there to eat? Give me five loaves of bread or anything else you have.”
1SA.21.4	“We don’t have any regular bread,” the priest replied. “But there is the holy bread, which you can have if your young men have not slept with any women recently.”
1SA.21.5	“Don’t worry,” David replied. “I never allow my men to be with women when we are on a campaign. And since they stay clean even on ordinary trips, how much more on this one!”
1SA.21.6	Since there was no other food available, the priest gave him the holy bread—the Bread of the Presence that was placed before the 
1SA.21.7	Now Doeg the Edomite, Saul’s chief herdsman, was there that day, having been detained before the 
1SA.21.8	David asked Ahimelech, “Do you have a spear or sword? The king’s business was so urgent that I didn’t even have time to grab a weapon!”
1SA.21.9	“I only have the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah,” the priest replied. “It is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. Take that if you want it, for there is nothing else here.”
1SA.21.9	“There is nothing like it!” David replied. “Give it to me!”
1SA.21.10	So David escaped from Saul and went to King Achish of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	But the officers of Achish were unhappy about his being there. “Isn’t this David, the king of the land?” they asked. “Isn’t he the one the people honor with dances, singing,
1SA.21.11	‘Saul has killed his thousands,
1SA.21.11	and David his ten thousands’?”
1SA.21.12	David heard these comments and was very afraid of what King Achish of Gath might do to him. 
1SA.21.13	So he pretended to be insane, scratching on doors and drooling down his beard.
1SA.21.14	Finally, King Achish said to his men, “Must you bring me a madman? 
1SA.21.15	We already have enough of them around here! Why should I let someone like this be my guest?”
1SA.22.1	So David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. Soon his brothers and all his other relatives joined him there. 
1SA.22.2	Then others began coming—men who were in trouble or in debt or who were just discontented—until David was the captain of about 400 men.
1SA.22.3	Later David went to Mizpeh in Moab, where he asked the king, “Please allow my father and mother to live here with you until I know what God is going to do for me.” 
1SA.22.4	So David’s parents stayed in Moab with the king during the entire time David was living in his stronghold.
1SA.22.5	One day the prophet Gad told David, “Leave the stronghold and return to the land of Judah.” So David went to the forest of Hereth.
1SA.22.6	The news of his arrival in Judah soon reached Saul. At the time, the king was sitting beneath the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, holding his spear and surrounded by his officers.
1SA.22.7	“Listen here, you men of Benjamin!” Saul shouted to his officers when he heard the news. “Has that son of Jesse promised every one of you fields and vineyards? Has he promised to make you all generals and captains in his army?
1SA.22.8	Is that why you have conspired against me? For not one of you told me when my own son made a solemn pact with the son of Jesse. You’re not even sorry for me. Think of it! My own son—encouraging him to kill me, as he is trying to do this very day!”
1SA.22.9	Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing there with Saul’s men, spoke up. “When I was at Nob,” he said, “I saw the son of Jesse talking to the priest, Ahimelech son of Ahitub. 
1SA.22.10	Ahimelech consulted the 
1SA.22.11	King Saul immediately sent for Ahimelech and all his family, who served as priests at Nob. 
1SA.22.12	When they arrived, Saul shouted at him, “Listen to me, you son of Ahitub!”
1SA.22.12	“What is it, my king?” Ahimelech asked.
1SA.22.13	“Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me?” Saul demanded. “Why did you give him food and a sword? Why have you consulted God for him? Why have you encouraged him to kill me, as he is trying to do this very day?”
1SA.22.14	“But sir,” Ahimelech replied, “is anyone among all your servants as faithful as David, your son-in-law? Why, he is the captain of your bodyguard and a highly honored member of your household! 
1SA.22.15	This was certainly not the first time I had consulted God for him! May the king not accuse me and my family in this matter, for I knew nothing at all of any plot against you.”
1SA.22.16	“You will surely die, Ahimelech, along with your entire family!” the king shouted. 
1SA.22.17	And he ordered his bodyguards, “Kill these priests of the 
1SA.22.18	Then the king said to Doeg, “You do it.” So Doeg the Edomite turned on them and killed them that day, eighty-five priests in all, still wearing their priestly garments. 
1SA.22.19	Then he went to Nob, the town of the priests, and killed the priests’ families—men and women, children and babies—and all the cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats.
1SA.22.20	Only Abiathar, one of the sons of Ahimelech, escaped and fled to David. 
1SA.22.21	When he told David that Saul had killed the priests of the 
1SA.22.22	David exclaimed, “I knew it! When I saw Doeg the Edomite there that day, I knew he was sure to tell Saul. Now I have caused the death of all your father’s family. 
1SA.22.23	Stay here with me, and don’t be afraid. I will protect you with my own life, for the same person wants to kill us both.”
1SA.23.1	One day news came to David that the Philistines were at Keilah stealing grain from the threshing floors. 
1SA.23.2	David asked the 
1SA.23.2	“Yes, go and save Keilah,” the 
1SA.23.3	But David’s men said, “We’re afraid even here in Judah. We certainly don’t want to go to Keilah to fight the whole Philistine army!”
1SA.23.4	So David asked the 
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Keilah. They slaughtered the Philistines and took all their livestock and rescued the people of Keilah. 
1SA.23.6	Now when Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he brought the ephod with him.
1SA.23.7	Saul soon learned that David was at Keilah. “Good!” he exclaimed. “We’ve got him now! God has handed him over to me, for he has trapped himself in a walled town!” 
1SA.23.8	So Saul mobilized his entire army to march to Keilah and besiege David and his men.
1SA.23.9	But David learned of Saul’s plan and told Abiathar the priest to bring the ephod and ask the 
1SA.23.10	Then David prayed, “O 
1SA.23.11	Will the leaders of Keilah betray me to him?
1SA.23.11	And the 
1SA.23.12	Again David asked, “Will the leaders of Keilah betray me and my men to Saul?”
1SA.23.12	And the 
1SA.23.13	So David and his men—about 600 of them now—left Keilah and began roaming the countryside. Word soon reached Saul that David had escaped, so he didn’t go to Keilah after all. 
1SA.23.14	David now stayed in the strongholds of the wilderness and in the hill country of Ziph. Saul hunted him day after day, but God didn’t let Saul find him.
1SA.23.15	One day near Horesh, David received the news that Saul was on the way to Ziph to search for him and kill him. 
1SA.23.16	Jonathan went to find David and encouraged him to stay strong in his faith in God. 
1SA.23.17	“Don’t be afraid,” Jonathan reassured him. “My father will never find you! You are going to be the king of Israel, and I will be next to you, as my father, Saul, is well aware.” 
1SA.23.18	So the two of them renewed their solemn pact before the 
1SA.23.19	But now the men of Ziph went to Saul in Gibeah and betrayed David to him. “We know where David is hiding,” they said. “He is in the strongholds of Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, which is in the southern part of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.20	Come down whenever you’re ready, O king, and we will catch him and hand him over to you!”
1SA.23.21	“The 
1SA.23.22	Go and check again to be sure of where he is staying and who has seen him there, for I know that he is very crafty. 
1SA.23.23	Discover his hiding places, and come back when you are sure. Then I’ll go with you. And if he is in the area at all, I’ll track him down, even if I have to search every hiding place in Judah!” 
1SA.23.24	So the men of Ziph returned home ahead of Saul.
1SA.23.24	Meanwhile, David and his men had moved into the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah Valley south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.25	When David heard that Saul and his men were searching for him, he went even farther into the wilderness to the great rock, and he remained there in the wilderness of Maon. But Saul kept after him in the wilderness.
1SA.23.26	Saul and David were now on opposite sides of a mountain. Just as Saul and his men began to close in on David and his men, 
1SA.23.27	an urgent message reached Saul that the Philistines were raiding Israel again. 
1SA.23.28	So Saul quit chasing David and returned to fight the Philistines. Ever since that time, the place where David was camped has been called the Rock of Escape.
1SA.23.29	David then went to live in the strongholds of En-gedi.
1SA.24.1	After Saul returned from fighting the Philistines, he was told that David had gone into the wilderness of En-gedi. 
1SA.24.2	So Saul chose 3,000 elite troops from all Israel and went to search for David and his men near the rocks of the wild goats.
1SA.24.3	At the place where the road passes some sheepfolds, Saul went into a cave to relieve himself. But as it happened, David and his men were hiding farther back in that very cave!
1SA.24.4	“Now’s your opportunity!” David’s men whispered to him. “Today the 
1SA.24.5	But then David’s conscience began bothering him because he had cut Saul’s robe. 
1SA.24.6	He said to his men, “The 
1SA.24.7	So David restrained his men and did not let them kill Saul.
1SA.24.7	After Saul had left the cave and gone on his way, 
1SA.24.8	David came out and shouted after him, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked around, David bowed low before him.
1SA.24.9	Then he shouted to Saul, “Why do you listen to the people who say I am trying to harm you? 
1SA.24.10	This very day you can see with your own eyes it isn’t true. For the 
1SA.24.11	Look, my father, at what I have in my hand. It is a piece of the hem of your robe! I cut it off, but I didn’t kill you. This proves that I am not trying to harm you and that I have not sinned against you, even though you have been hunting for me to kill me.
1SA.24.12	“May the 
1SA.24.13	As that old proverb says, ‘From evil people come evil deeds.’ So you can be sure I will never harm you. 
1SA.24.14	Who is the king of Israel trying to catch anyway? Should he spend his time chasing one who is as worthless as a dead dog or a single flea? 
1SA.24.15	May the 
1SA.24.16	When David had finished speaking, Saul called back, “Is that really you, my son David?” Then he began to cry. 
1SA.24.17	And he said to David, “You are a better man than I am, for you have repaid me good for evil. 
1SA.24.18	Yes, you have been amazingly kind to me today, for when the 
1SA.24.19	Who else would let his enemy get away when he had him in his power? May the 
1SA.24.20	And now I realize that you are surely going to be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will flourish under your rule. 
1SA.24.21	Now swear to me by the 
1SA.24.22	So David promised this to Saul with an oath. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went back to their stronghold.
1SA.25.1	Now Samuel died, and all Israel gathered for his funeral. They buried him at his house in Ramah.
1SA.25.1	Then David moved down to the wilderness of Maon.
1SA.25.2	There was a wealthy man from Maon who owned property near the town of Carmel. He had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats, and it was sheep-shearing time. 
1SA.25.3	This man’s name was Nabal, and his wife, Abigail, was a sensible and beautiful woman. But Nabal, a descendant of Caleb, was crude and mean in all his dealings.
1SA.25.4	When David heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep, 
1SA.25.5	he sent ten of his young men to Carmel with this message for Nabal: 
1SA.25.6	“Peace and prosperity to you, your family, and everything you own! 
1SA.25.7	I am told that it is sheep-shearing time. While your shepherds stayed among us near Carmel, we never harmed them, and nothing was ever stolen from them. 
1SA.25.8	Ask your own men, and they will tell you this is true. So would you be kind to us, since we have come at a time of celebration? Please share any provisions you might have on hand with us and with your friend David.” 
1SA.25.9	David’s young men gave this message to Nabal in David’s name, and they waited for a reply.
1SA.25.10	“Who is this fellow David?” Nabal sneered to the young men. “Who does this son of Jesse think he is? There are lots of servants these days who run away from their masters. 
1SA.25.11	Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I’ve slaughtered for my shearers and give it to a band of outlaws who come from who knows where?”
1SA.25.12	So David’s young men returned and told him what Nabal had said. 
1SA.25.13	“Get your swords!” was David’s reply as he strapped on his own. Then 400 men started off with David, and 200 remained behind to guard their equipment.
1SA.25.14	Meanwhile, one of Nabal’s servants went to Abigail and told her, “David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he screamed insults at them. 
1SA.25.15	These men have been very good to us, and we never suffered any harm from them. Nothing was stolen from us the whole time they were with us. 
1SA.25.16	In fact, day and night they were like a wall of protection to us and the sheep. 
1SA.25.17	You need to know this and figure out what to do, for there is going to be trouble for our master and his whole family. He’s so ill-tempered that no one can even talk to him!”
1SA.25.18	Abigail wasted no time. She quickly gathered 200 loaves of bread, two wineskins full of wine, five sheep that had been slaughtered, nearly a bushel
1SA.25.19	and said to her servants, “Go on ahead. I will follow you shortly.” But she didn’t tell her husband Nabal what she was doing.
1SA.25.20	As she was riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, she saw David and his men coming toward her. 
1SA.25.21	David had just been saying, “A lot of good it did to help this fellow. We protected his flocks in the wilderness, and nothing he owned was lost or stolen. But he has repaid me evil for good. 
1SA.25.22	May God strike me and kill me
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed low before him. 
1SA.25.24	She fell at his feet and said, “I accept all blame in this matter, my lord. Please listen to what I have to say. 
1SA.25.25	I know Nabal is a wicked and ill-tempered man; please don’t pay any attention to him. He is a fool, just as his name suggests.
1SA.25.26	“Now, my lord, as surely as the 
1SA.25.27	And here is a present that I, your servant, have brought to you and your young men. 
1SA.25.28	Please forgive me if I have offended you in any way. The 
1SA.25.29	“Even when you are chased by those who seek to kill you, your life is safe in the care of the 
1SA.25.30	When the 
1SA.25.31	don’t let this be a blemish on your record. Then your conscience won’t have to bear the staggering burden of needless bloodshed and vengeance. And when the 
1SA.25.32	David replied to Abigail, “Praise the 
1SA.25.33	Thank God for your good sense! Bless you for keeping me from murder and from carrying out vengeance with my own hands. 
1SA.25.34	For I swear by the 
1SA.25.35	Then David accepted her present and told her, “Return home in peace. I have heard what you said. We will not kill your husband.”
1SA.25.36	When Abigail arrived home, she found that Nabal was throwing a big party and was celebrating like a king. He was very drunk, so she didn’t tell him anything about her meeting with David until dawn the next day. 
1SA.25.37	In the morning when Nabal was sober, his wife told him what had happened. As a result he had a stroke,
1SA.25.38	About ten days later, the 
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise the 
1SA.25.40	When the messengers arrived at Carmel, they told Abigail, “David has sent us to take you back to marry him.”
1SA.25.41	She bowed low to the ground and responded, “I, your servant, would be happy to marry David. I would even be willing to become a slave, washing the feet of his servants!” 
1SA.25.42	Quickly getting ready, she took along five of her servant girls as attendants, mounted her donkey, and went with David’s messengers. And so she became his wife. 
1SA.25.43	David also married Ahinoam from Jezreel, making both of them his wives. 
1SA.25.44	Saul, meanwhile, had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to a man from Gallim named Palti son of Laish.
1SA.26.1	Now some men from Ziph came to Saul at Gibeah to tell him, “David is hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which overlooks Jeshimon.”
1SA.26.2	So Saul took 3,000 of Israel’s elite troops and went to hunt him down in the wilderness of Ziph. 
1SA.26.3	Saul camped along the road beside the hill of Hakilah, near Jeshimon, where David was hiding. When David learned that Saul had come after him into the wilderness, 
1SA.26.4	he sent out spies to verify the report of Saul’s arrival.
1SA.26.5	David slipped over to Saul’s camp one night to look around. Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of his army, were sleeping inside a ring formed by the slumbering warriors. 
1SA.26.6	“Who will volunteer to go in there with me?” David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother.
1SA.26.6	“I’ll go with you,” Abishai replied. 
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai went right into Saul’s camp and found him asleep, with his spear stuck in the ground beside his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying asleep around him.
1SA.26.8	“God has surely handed your enemy over to you this time!” Abishai whispered to David. “Let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won’t need to strike twice!”
1SA.26.9	“No!” David said. “Don’t kill him. For who can remain innocent after attacking the 
1SA.26.10	Surely the 
1SA.26.11	The 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and jug of water that were near Saul’s head. Then he and Abishai got away without anyone seeing them or even waking up, because the 
1SA.26.13	David climbed the hill opposite the camp until he was at a safe distance. 
1SA.26.14	Then he shouted down to the soldiers and to Abner son of Ner, “Wake up, Abner!”
1SA.26.14	“Who is it?” Abner demanded.
1SA.26.15	“Well, Abner, you’re a great man, aren’t you?” David taunted. “Where in all Israel is there anyone as mighty? So why haven’t you guarded your master the king when someone came to kill him? 
1SA.26.16	This isn’t good at all! I swear by the 
1SA.26.17	Saul recognized David’s voice and called out, “Is that you, my son David?”
1SA.26.17	And David replied, “Yes, my lord the king. 
1SA.26.18	Why are you chasing me? What have I done? What is my crime? 
1SA.26.19	But now let my lord the king listen to his servant. If the 
1SA.26.20	Must I die on foreign soil, far from the presence of the 
1SA.26.21	Then Saul confessed, “I have sinned. Come back home, my son, and I will no longer try to harm you, for you valued my life today. I have been a fool and very, very wrong.”
1SA.26.22	“Here is your spear, O king,” David replied. “Let one of your young men come over and get it. 
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	Now may the 
1SA.26.25	And Saul said to David, “Blessings on you, my son David. You will do many heroic deeds, and you will surely succeed.” Then David went away, and Saul returned home.
1SA.27.1	But David kept thinking to himself, “Someday Saul is going to get me. The best thing I can do is escape to the Philistines. Then Saul will stop hunting for me in Israelite territory, and I will finally be safe.”
1SA.27.2	So David took his 600 men and went over and joined Achish son of Maoch, the king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	David and his men and their families settled there with Achish at Gath. David brought his two wives along with him—Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, Nabal’s widow from Carmel. 
1SA.27.4	Word soon reached Saul that David had fled to Gath, so he stopped hunting for him.
1SA.27.5	One day David said to Achish, “If it is all right with you, we would rather live in one of the country towns instead of here in the royal city.”
1SA.27.6	So Achish gave him the town of Ziklag (which still belongs to the kings of Judah to this day), 
1SA.27.7	and they lived there among the Philistines for a year and four months.
1SA.27.8	David and his men spent their time raiding the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites—people who had lived near Shur, toward the land of Egypt, since ancient times. 
1SA.27.9	David did not leave one person alive in the villages he attacked. He took the sheep, goats, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing before returning home to see King Achish.
1SA.27.10	“Where did you make your raid today?” Achish would ask.
1SA.27.10	And David would reply, “Against the south of Judah, the Jerahmeelites, and the Kenites.”
1SA.27.11	No one was left alive to come to Gath and tell where he had really been. This happened again and again while he was living among the Philistines. 
1SA.27.12	Achish believed David and thought to himself, “By now the people of Israel must hate him bitterly. Now he will have to stay here and serve me forever!”
1SA.28.1	About that time the Philistines mustered their armies for another war with Israel. King Achish told David, “You and your men will be expected to join me in battle.”
1SA.28.2	“Very well!” David agreed. “Now you will see for yourself what we can do.”
1SA.28.2	Then Achish told David, “I will make you my personal bodyguard for life.”
1SA.28.3	Meanwhile, Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him. He was buried in Ramah, his hometown. And Saul had banned from the land of Israel all mediums and those who consult the spirits of the dead.
1SA.28.4	The Philistines set up their camp at Shunem, and Saul gathered all the army of Israel and camped at Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	When Saul saw the vast Philistine army, he became frantic with fear. 
1SA.28.6	He asked the 
1SA.28.7	Saul then said to his advisers, “Find a woman who is a medium, so I can go and ask her what to do.”
1SA.28.7	His advisers replied, “There is a medium at Endor.”
1SA.28.8	So Saul disguised himself by wearing ordinary clothing instead of his royal robes. Then he went to the woman’s home at night, accompanied by two of his men.
1SA.28.8	“I have to talk to a man who has died,” he said. “Will you call up his spirit for me?”
1SA.28.9	“Are you trying to get me killed?” the woman demanded. “You know that Saul has outlawed all the mediums and all who consult the spirits of the dead. Why are you setting a trap for me?”
1SA.28.10	But Saul took an oath in the name of the 
1SA.28.11	Finally, the woman said, “Well, whose spirit do you want me to call up?”
1SA.28.11	“Call up Samuel,” Saul replied.
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed, “You’ve deceived me! You are Saul!”
1SA.28.13	“Don’t be afraid!” the king told her. “What do you see?”
1SA.28.13	“I see a god
1SA.28.14	“What does he look like?” Saul asked.
1SA.28.14	“He is an old man wrapped in a robe,” she replied. Saul realized it was Samuel, and he fell to the ground before him.
1SA.28.15	“Why have you disturbed me by calling me back?” Samuel asked Saul.
1SA.28.15	“Because I am in deep trouble,” Saul replied. “The Philistines are at war with me, and God has left me and won’t reply by prophets or dreams. So I have called for you to tell me what to do.”
1SA.28.16	But Samuel replied, “Why ask me, since the 
1SA.28.17	The 
1SA.28.18	The 
1SA.28.19	What’s more, the 
1SA.28.20	Saul fell full length on the ground, paralyzed with fright because of Samuel’s words. He was also faint with hunger, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.
1SA.28.21	When the woman saw how distraught he was, she said, “Sir, I obeyed your command at the risk of my life. 
1SA.28.22	Now do what I say, and let me give you a little something to eat so you can regain your strength for the trip back.”
1SA.28.23	But Saul refused to eat anything. Then his advisers joined the woman in urging him to eat, so he finally yielded and got up from the ground and sat on the couch.
1SA.28.24	The woman had been fattening a calf, so she hurried out and killed it. She took some flour, kneaded it into dough and baked unleavened bread. 
1SA.28.25	She brought the meal to Saul and his advisers, and they ate it. Then they went out into the night.
1SA.29.1	The entire Philistine army now mobilized at Aphek, and the Israelites camped at the spring in Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	As the Philistine rulers were leading out their troops in groups of hundreds and thousands, David and his men marched at the rear with King Achish. 
1SA.29.3	But the Philistine commanders demanded, “What are these Hebrews doing here?”
1SA.29.3	And Achish told them, “This is David, the servant of King Saul of Israel. He’s been with me for years, and I’ve never found a single fault in him from the day he arrived until today.”
1SA.29.4	But the Philistine commanders were angry. “Send him back to the town you’ve given him!” they demanded. “He can’t go into the battle with us. What if he turns against us in battle and becomes our adversary? Is there any better way for him to reconcile himself with his master than by handing our heads over to him? 
1SA.29.5	Isn’t this the same David about whom the women of Israel sing in their dances, 
1SA.29.5	‘Saul has killed his thousands,
1SA.29.5	and David his ten thousands’?”
1SA.29.6	So Achish finally summoned David and said to him, “I swear by the 
1SA.29.7	Please don’t upset them, but go back quietly.”
1SA.29.8	“What have I done to deserve this treatment?” David demanded. “What have you ever found in your servant, that I can’t go and fight the enemies of my lord the king?”
1SA.29.9	But Achish insisted, “As far as I’m concerned, you’re as perfect as an angel of God. But the Philistine commanders are afraid to have you with them in the battle. 
1SA.29.10	Now get up early in the morning, and leave with your men as soon as it gets light.”
1SA.29.11	So David and his men headed back into the land of the Philistines, while the Philistine army went on to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	Three days later, when David and his men arrived home at their town of Ziklag, they found that the Amalekites had made a raid into the Negev and Ziklag; they had crushed Ziklag and burned it to the ground. 
1SA.30.2	They had carried off the women and children and everyone else but without killing anyone.
1SA.30.3	When David and his men saw the ruins and realized what had happened to their families, 
1SA.30.4	they wept until they could weep no more. 
1SA.30.5	David’s two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel, were among those captured. 
1SA.30.6	David was now in great danger because all his men were very bitter about losing their sons and daughters, and they began to talk of stoning him. But David found strength in the 
1SA.30.7	Then he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring me the ephod!” So Abiathar brought it. 
1SA.30.8	Then David asked the 
1SA.30.8	And the 
1SA.30.9	So David and his 600 men set out, and they came to the brook Besor. 
1SA.30.10	But 200 of the men were too exhausted to cross the brook, so David continued the pursuit with 400 men.
1SA.30.11	Along the way they found an Egyptian man in a field and brought him to David. They gave him some bread to eat and water to drink. 
1SA.30.12	They also gave him part of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins, for he hadn’t had anything to eat or drink for three days and nights. Before long his strength returned.
1SA.30.13	“To whom do you belong, and where do you come from?” David asked him.
1SA.30.13	“I am an Egyptian—the slave of an Amalekite,” he replied. “My master abandoned me three days ago because I was sick. 
1SA.30.14	We were on our way back from raiding the Kerethites in the Negev, the territory of Judah, and the land of Caleb, and we had just burned Ziklag.”
1SA.30.15	“Will you lead me to this band of raiders?” David asked.
1SA.30.15	The young man replied, “If you take an oath in God’s name that you will not kill me or give me back to my master, then I will guide you to them.”
1SA.30.16	So he led David to them, and they found the Amalekites spread out across the fields, eating and drinking and dancing with joy because of the vast amount of plunder they had taken from the Philistines and the land of Judah. 
1SA.30.17	David and his men rushed in among them and slaughtered them throughout that night and the entire next day until evening. None of the Amalekites escaped except 400 young men who fled on camels. 
1SA.30.18	David got back everything the Amalekites had taken, and he rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	Nothing was missing: small or great, son or daughter, nor anything else that had been taken. David brought everything back. 
1SA.30.20	He also recovered all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock. “This plunder belongs to David!” they said.
1SA.30.21	Then David returned to the brook Besor and met up with the 200 men who had been left behind because they were too exhausted to go with him. They went out to meet David and his men, and David greeted them joyfully. 
1SA.30.22	But some evil troublemakers among David’s men said, “They didn’t go with us, so they can’t have any of the plunder we recovered. Give them their wives and children, and tell them to be gone.”
1SA.30.23	But David said, “No, my brothers! Don’t be selfish with what the 
1SA.30.24	Who will listen when you talk like this? We share and share alike—those who go to battle and those who guard the equipment.” 
1SA.30.25	From then on David made this a decree and regulation for Israel, and it is still followed today.
1SA.30.26	When he arrived at Ziklag, David sent part of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends. “Here is a present for you, taken from the 
1SA.30.27	The gifts were sent to the people of the following towns David had visited: Bethel, Ramoth-negev, Jattir, 
1SA.30.28	Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	Racal,
1SA.30.30	Hormah, Bor-ashan, Athach, 
1SA.30.31	Hebron, and all the other places David and his men had visited.
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines attacked Israel, and the men of Israel fled before them. Many were slaughtered on the slopes of Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	The Philistines closed in on Saul and his sons, and they killed three of his sons—Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malkishua. 
1SA.31.3	The fighting grew very fierce around Saul, and the Philistine archers caught up with him and wounded him severely.
1SA.31.4	Saul groaned to his armor bearer, “Take your sword and kill me before these pagan Philistines come to run me through and taunt and torture me.”
1SA.31.4	But his armor bearer was afraid and would not do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it. 
1SA.31.5	When his armor bearer realized that Saul was dead, he fell on his own sword and died beside the king. 
1SA.31.6	So Saul, his three sons, his armor bearer, and his troops all died together that same day.
1SA.31.7	When the Israelites on the other side of the Jezreel Valley and beyond the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled. So the Philistines moved in and occupied their towns.
1SA.31.8	The next day, when the Philistines went out to strip the dead, they found the bodies of Saul and his three sons on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	So they cut off Saul’s head and stripped off his armor. Then they proclaimed the good news of Saul’s death in their pagan temple and to the people throughout the land of Philistia. 
1SA.31.10	They placed his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths, and they fastened his body to the wall of the city of Beth-shan.
1SA.31.11	But when the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	all their mighty warriors traveled through the night to Beth-shan and took the bodies of Saul and his sons down from the wall. They brought them to Jabesh, where they burned the bodies. 
1SA.31.13	Then they took their bones and buried them beneath the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted for seven days.
2SA.1.1	After the death of Saul, David returned from his victory over the Amalekites and spent two days in Ziklag. 
2SA.1.2	On the third day a man arrived from Saul’s army camp. He had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head to show that he was in mourning. He fell to the ground before David in deep respect.
2SA.1.3	“Where have you come from?” David asked.
2SA.1.3	“I escaped from the Israelite camp,” the man replied.
2SA.1.4	“What happened?” David demanded. “Tell me how the battle went.”
2SA.1.4	The man replied, “Our entire army fled from the battle. Many of the men are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.”
2SA.1.5	“How do you know Saul and Jonathan are dead?” David demanded of the young man.
2SA.1.6	The man answered, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear with the enemy chariots and charioteers closing in on him. 
2SA.1.7	When he turned and saw me, he cried out for me to come to him. ‘How can I help?’ I asked him.
2SA.1.8	“He responded, ‘Who are you?’
2SA.1.8	“‘I am an Amalekite,’ I told him.
2SA.1.9	“Then he begged me, ‘Come over here and put me out of my misery, for I am in terrible pain and want to die.’
2SA.1.10	“So I killed him,” the Amalekite told David, “for I knew he couldn’t live. Then I took his crown and his armband, and I have brought them here to you, my lord.”
2SA.1.11	David and his men tore their clothes in sorrow when they heard the news. 
2SA.1.12	They mourned and wept and fasted all day for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the 
2SA.1.13	Then David said to the young man who had brought the news, “Where are you from?”
2SA.1.13	And he replied, “I am a foreigner, an Amalekite, who lives in your land.”
2SA.1.14	“Why were you not afraid to kill the 
2SA.1.15	Then David said to one of his men, “Kill him!” So the man thrust his sword into the Amalekite and killed him. 
2SA.1.16	“You have condemned yourself,” David said, “for you yourself confessed that you killed the 
2SA.1.17	Then David composed a funeral song for Saul and Jonathan, 
2SA.1.18	and he commanded that it be taught to the people of Judah. It is known as the Song of the Bow, and it is recorded in 
2SA.1.19	Your pride and joy, O Israel, lies dead on the hills!
2SA.1.19	Oh, how the mighty heroes have fallen!
2SA.1.20	Don’t announce the news in Gath,
2SA.1.20	don’t proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon,
2SA.1.20	or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice
2SA.1.20	and the pagans will laugh in triumph.
2SA.1.21	O mountains of Gilboa,
2SA.1.21	let there be no dew or rain upon you,
2SA.1.21	nor fruitful fields producing offerings of grain.
2SA.1.21	For there the shield of the mighty heroes was defiled;
2SA.1.21	the shield of Saul will no longer be anointed with oil.
2SA.1.22	The bow of Jonathan was powerful,
2SA.1.22	and the sword of Saul did its mighty work.
2SA.1.22	They shed the blood of their enemies
2SA.1.22	and pierced the bodies of mighty heroes.
2SA.1.23	How beloved and gracious were Saul and Jonathan!
2SA.1.23	They were together in life and in death.
2SA.1.23	They were swifter than eagles,
2SA.1.23	stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	O women of Israel, weep for Saul,
2SA.1.24	for he dressed you in luxurious scarlet clothing,
2SA.1.24	in garments decorated with gold.
2SA.1.25	Oh, how the mighty heroes have fallen in battle!
2SA.1.25	Jonathan lies dead on the hills.
2SA.1.26	How I weep for you, my brother Jonathan!
2SA.1.26	Oh, how much I loved you!
2SA.1.26	And your love for me was deep,
2SA.1.26	deeper than the love of women!
2SA.1.27	Oh, how the mighty heroes have fallen!
2SA.1.27	Stripped of their weapons, they lie dead.
2SA.2.1	After this, David asked the 
2SA.2.1	“Yes,” the 
2SA.2.1	Then David asked, “Which town should I go to?”
2SA.2.1	“To Hebron,” the 
2SA.2.2	David’s two wives were Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel. So David and his wives 
2SA.2.3	and his men and their families all moved to Judah, and they settled in the villages near Hebron. 
2SA.2.4	Then the men of Judah came to David and anointed him king over the people of Judah.
2SA.2.4	When David heard that the men of Jabesh-gilead had buried Saul, 
2SA.2.5	he sent them this message: “May the 
2SA.2.6	May the 
2SA.2.7	Now that Saul is dead, I ask you to be my strong and loyal subjects like the people of Judah, who have anointed me as their new king.”
2SA.2.8	But Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had already gone to Mahanaim with Saul’s son Ishbosheth.
2SA.2.9	There he proclaimed Ishbosheth king over Gilead, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, the land of the Ashurites, and all the rest of Israel.
2SA.2.10	Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he became king, and he ruled from Mahanaim for two years. Meanwhile, the people of Judah remained loyal to David. 
2SA.2.11	David made Hebron his capital, and he ruled as king of Judah for seven and a half years.
2SA.2.12	One day Abner led Ishbosheth’s troops from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	About the same time, Joab son of Zeruiah led David’s troops out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. The two groups sat down there, facing each other from opposite sides of the pool.
2SA.2.14	Then Abner suggested to Joab, “Let’s have a few of our warriors fight hand to hand here in front of us.”
2SA.2.14	“All right,” Joab agreed. 
2SA.2.15	So twelve men were chosen to fight from each side—twelve men of Benjamin representing Ishbosheth son of Saul, and twelve representing David. 
2SA.2.16	Each one grabbed his opponent by the hair and thrust his sword into the other’s side so that all of them died. So this place at Gibeon has been known ever since as the Field of Swords.
2SA.2.17	A fierce battle followed that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the forces of David.
2SA.2.18	Joab, Abishai, and Asahel—the three sons of Zeruiah—were among David’s forces that day. Asahel could run like a gazelle, 
2SA.2.19	and he began chasing Abner. He pursued him relentlessly, not stopping for anything. 
2SA.2.20	When Abner looked back and saw him coming, he called out, “Is that you, Asahel?”
2SA.2.20	“Yes, it is,” he replied.
2SA.2.21	“Go fight someone else!” Abner warned. “Take on one of the younger men, and strip him of his weapons.” But Asahel kept right on chasing Abner.
2SA.2.22	Again Abner shouted to him, “Get away from here! I don’t want to kill you. How could I ever face your brother Joab again?”
2SA.2.23	But Asahel refused to turn back, so Abner thrust the butt end of his spear through Asahel’s stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He stumbled to the ground and died there. And everyone who came by that spot stopped and stood still when they saw Asahel lying there.
2SA.2.24	When Joab and Abishai found out what had happened, they set out after Abner. The sun was just going down as they arrived at the hill of Ammah near Giah, along the road to the wilderness of Gibeon. 
2SA.2.25	Abner’s troops from the tribe of Benjamin regrouped there at the top of the hill to take a stand.
2SA.2.26	Abner shouted down to Joab, “Must we always be killing each other? Don’t you realize that bitterness is the only result? When will you call off your men from chasing their Israelite brothers?”
2SA.2.27	Then Joab said, “God only knows what would have happened if you hadn’t spoken, for we would have chased you all night if necessary.” 
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew the ram’s horn, and his men stopped chasing the troops of Israel.
2SA.2.29	All that night Abner and his men retreated through the Jordan Valley.
2SA.2.30	Meanwhile, Joab and his men also returned home. When Joab counted his casualties, he discovered that only 19 men were missing in addition to Asahel. 
2SA.2.31	But 360 of Abner’s men had been killed, all from the tribe of Benjamin. 
2SA.2.32	Joab and his men took Asahel’s body to Bethlehem and buried him there in his father’s tomb. Then they traveled all night and reached Hebron at daybreak.
2SA.3.1	That was the beginning of a long war between those who were loyal to Saul and those loyal to David. As time passed David became stronger and stronger, while Saul’s dynasty became weaker and weaker.
2SA.3.2	These are the sons who were born to David in Hebron:
2SA.3.2	The oldest was Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam from Jezreel.
2SA.3.3	The second was Daniel,
2SA.3.3	The third was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.
2SA.3.4	The fourth was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith.
2SA.3.4	The fifth was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital.
2SA.3.5	The sixth was Ithream, whose mother was Eglah, David’s wife.
2SA.3.5	These sons were all born to David in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	As the war between the house of Saul and the house of David went on, Abner became a powerful leader among those loyal to Saul. 
2SA.3.7	One day Ishbosheth,
2SA.3.8	Abner was furious. “Am I some Judean dog to be kicked around like this?” he shouted. “After all I have done for your father, Saul, and his family and friends by not handing you over to David, is this my reward—that you find fault with me about this woman? 
2SA.3.9	May God strike me and even kill me if I don’t do everything I can to help David get what the 
2SA.3.10	I’m going to take Saul’s kingdom and give it to David. I will establish the throne of David over Israel as well as Judah, all the way from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south.” 
2SA.3.11	Ishbosheth didn’t dare say another word because he was afraid of what Abner might do.
2SA.3.12	Then Abner sent messengers to David, saying, “Doesn’t the entire land belong to you? Make a solemn pact with me, and I will help turn over all of Israel to you.”
2SA.3.13	“All right,” David replied, “but I will not negotiate with you unless you bring back my wife Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come.”
2SA.3.14	David then sent this message to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son: “Give me back my wife Michal, for I bought her with the lives
2SA.3.15	So Ishbosheth took Michal away from her husband, Palti
2SA.3.16	Palti followed along behind her as far as Bahurim, weeping as he went. Then Abner told him, “Go back home!” So Palti returned.
2SA.3.17	Meanwhile, Abner had consulted with the elders of Israel. “For some time now,” he told them, “you have wanted to make David your king. 
2SA.3.18	Now is the time! For the 
2SA.3.19	Abner also spoke with the men of Benjamin. Then he went to Hebron to tell David that all the people of Israel and Benjamin had agreed to support him.
2SA.3.20	When Abner and twenty of his men came to Hebron, David entertained them with a great feast. 
2SA.3.21	Then Abner said to David, “Let me go and call an assembly of all Israel to support my lord the king. They will make a covenant with you to make you their king, and you will rule over everything your heart desires.” So David sent Abner safely on his way.
2SA.3.22	But just after David had sent Abner away in safety, Joab and some of David’s troops returned from a raid, bringing much plunder with them. 
2SA.3.23	When Joab arrived, he was told that Abner had just been there visiting the king and had been sent away in safety.
2SA.3.24	Joab rushed to the king and demanded, “What have you done? What do you mean by letting Abner get away? 
2SA.3.25	You know perfectly well that he came to spy on you and find out everything you’re doing!”
2SA.3.26	Joab then left David and sent messengers to catch up with Abner, asking him to return. They found him at the well of Sirah and brought him back, though David knew nothing about it. 
2SA.3.27	When Abner arrived back at Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gateway as if to speak with him privately. But then he stabbed Abner in the stomach and killed him in revenge for killing his brother Asahel.
2SA.3.28	When David heard about it, he declared, “I vow by the 
2SA.3.29	Joab and his family are the guilty ones. May the family of Joab be cursed in every generation with a man who has open sores or leprosy
2SA.3.30	So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because Abner had killed their brother Asahel at the battle of Gibeon.
2SA.3.31	Then David said to Joab and all those who were with him, “Tear your clothes and put on burlap. Mourn for Abner.” And King David himself walked behind the procession to the grave. 
2SA.3.32	They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king and all the people wept at his graveside. 
2SA.3.33	Then the king sang this funeral song for Abner:
2SA.3.33	“Should Abner have died as fools die?
2SA.3.34	Your hands were not bound;
2SA.3.34	your feet were not chained.
2SA.3.34	No, you were murdered—
2SA.3.34	the victim of a wicked plot.”
2SA.3.34	All the people wept again for Abner. 
2SA.3.35	David had refused to eat anything on the day of the funeral, and now everyone begged him to eat. But David had made a vow, saying, “May God strike me and even kill me if I eat anything before sundown.”
2SA.3.36	This pleased the people very much. In fact, everything the king did pleased them! 
2SA.3.37	So everyone in Judah and all Israel understood that David was not responsible for Abner’s murder.
2SA.3.38	Then King David said to his officials, “Don’t you realize that a great commander has fallen today in Israel? 
2SA.3.39	And even though I am the anointed king, these two sons of Zeruiah—Joab and Abishai—are too strong for me to control. So may the 
2SA.4.1	When Ishbosheth,
2SA.4.2	Now there were two brothers, Baanah and Recab, who were captains of Ishbosheth’s raiding parties. They were sons of Rimmon, a member of the tribe of Benjamin who lived in Beeroth. The town of Beeroth is now part of Benjamin’s territory 
2SA.4.3	because the original people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim, where they still live as foreigners.
2SA.4.4	(Saul’s son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth,
2SA.4.5	One day Recab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth, went to Ishbosheth’s house around noon as he was taking his midday rest. 
2SA.4.6	The doorkeeper, who had been sifting wheat, became drowsy and fell asleep. So Recab and Baanah slipped past her.
2SA.4.7	They went into the house and found Ishbosheth sleeping on his bed. They struck and killed him and cut off his head. Then, taking his head with them, they fled across the Jordan Valley
2SA.4.8	When they arrived at Hebron, they presented Ishbosheth’s head to David. “Look!” they exclaimed to the king. “Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul who tried to kill you. Today the 
2SA.4.9	But David said to Recab and Baanah, “The 
2SA.4.10	Someone once told me, ‘Saul is dead,’ thinking he was bringing me good news. But I seized him and killed him at Ziklag. That’s the reward I gave him for his news! 
2SA.4.11	How much more should I reward evil men who have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed? Shouldn’t I hold you responsible for his blood and rid the earth of you?”
2SA.4.12	So David ordered his young men to kill them, and they did. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies beside the pool in Hebron. Then they took Ishbosheth’s head and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.
2SA.5.1	Then all the tribes of Israel went to David at Hebron and told him, “We are your own flesh and blood. 
2SA.5.2	In the past,
2SA.5.3	So there at Hebron, King David made a covenant before the 
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in all. 
2SA.5.5	He had reigned over Judah from Hebron for seven years and six months, and from Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years.
2SA.5.6	David then led his men to Jerusalem to fight against the Jebusites, the original inhabitants of the land who were living there. The Jebusites taunted David, saying, “You’ll never get in here! Even the blind and lame could keep you out!” For the Jebusites thought they were safe. 
2SA.5.7	But David captured the fortress of Zion, which is now called the City of David.
2SA.5.8	On the day of the attack, David said to his troops, “I hate those ‘lame’ and ‘blind’ Jebusites.
2SA.5.9	So David made the fortress his home, and he called it the City of David. He extended the city, starting at the supporting terraces
2SA.5.10	And David became more and more powerful, because the 
2SA.5.11	Then King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built David a palace. 
2SA.5.12	And David realized that the 
2SA.5.13	After moving from Hebron to Jerusalem, David married more concubines and wives, and they had more sons and daughters. 
2SA.5.14	These are the names of David’s sons who were born in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of Israel, they mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David was told they were coming, so he went into the stronghold. 
2SA.5.18	The Philistines arrived and spread out across the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.19	So David asked the 
2SA.5.19	The 
2SA.5.20	So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there. “The 
2SA.5.21	The Philistines had abandoned their idols there, so David and his men confiscated them.
2SA.5.22	But after a while the Philistines returned and again spread out across the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.23	And again David asked the 
2SA.5.24	When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the poplar trees, be on the alert! That will be the signal that the 
2SA.5.25	So David did what the 
2SA.6.1	Then David again gathered all the elite troops in Israel, 30,000 in all. 
2SA.6.2	He led them to Baalah of Judah
2SA.6.3	They placed the Ark of God on a new cart and brought it from Abinadab’s house, which was on a hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab’s sons, were guiding the cart 
2SA.6.4	that carried the Ark of God.
2SA.6.5	David and all the people of Israel were celebrating before the 
2SA.6.6	But when they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out his hand and steadied the Ark of God. 
2SA.6.7	Then the 
2SA.6.8	David was angry because the 
2SA.6.9	David was now afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	So David decided not to move the Ark of the 
2SA.6.11	The Ark of the 
2SA.6.12	Then King David was told, “The 
2SA.6.13	After the men who were carrying the Ark of the 
2SA.6.14	And David danced before the 
2SA.6.15	So David and all the people of Israel brought up the Ark of the 
2SA.6.16	But as the Ark of the 
2SA.6.17	They brought the Ark of the 
2SA.6.18	When he had finished his sacrifices, David blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	Then he gave to every Israelite man and woman in the crowd a loaf of bread, a cake of dates,
2SA.6.20	When David returned home to bless his own family, Michal, the daughter of Saul, came out to meet him. She said in disgust, “How distinguished the king of Israel looked today, shamelessly exposing himself to the servant girls like any vulgar person might do!”
2SA.6.21	David retorted to Michal, “I was dancing before the 
2SA.6.22	Yes, and I am willing to look even more foolish than this, even to be humiliated in my own eyes! But those servant girls you mentioned will indeed think I am distinguished!” 
2SA.6.23	So Michal, the daughter of Saul, remained childless throughout her entire life.
2SA.7.1	When King David was settled in his palace and the 
2SA.7.2	the king summoned Nathan the prophet. “Look,” David said, “I am living in a beautiful cedar palace,
2SA.7.3	Nathan replied to the king, “Go ahead and do whatever you have in mind, for the 
2SA.7.4	But that same night the 
2SA.7.5	“Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the 
2SA.7.6	I have never lived in a house, from the day I brought the Israelites out of Egypt until this very day. I have always moved from one place to another with a tent and a Tabernacle as my dwelling. 
2SA.7.7	Yet no matter where I have gone with the Israelites, I have never once complained to Israel’s tribal leaders, the shepherds of my people Israel. I have never asked them, “Why haven’t you built me a beautiful cedar house?”’
2SA.7.8	“Now go and say to my servant David, ‘This is what the 
2SA.7.9	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before your eyes. Now I will make your name as famous as anyone who has ever lived on the earth! 
2SA.7.10	And I will provide a homeland for my people Israel, planting them in a secure place where they will never be disturbed. Evil nations won’t oppress them as they’ve done in the past, 
2SA.7.11	starting from the time I appointed judges to rule my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies.
2SA.7.11	“‘Furthermore, the 
2SA.7.12	For when you die and are buried with your ancestors, I will raise up one of your descendants, your own offspring, and I will make his kingdom strong. 
2SA.7.13	He is the one who will build a house—a temple—for my name. And I will secure his royal throne forever. 
2SA.7.14	I will be his father, and he will be my son. If he sins, I will correct and discipline him with the rod, like any father would do. 
2SA.7.15	But my favor will not be taken from him as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from your sight. 
2SA.7.16	Your house and your kingdom will continue before me
2SA.7.17	So Nathan went back to David and told him everything the 
2SA.7.18	Then King David went in and sat before the 
2SA.7.18	“Who am I, O Sovereign 
2SA.7.19	And now, Sovereign 
2SA.7.20	“What more can I say to you? You know what your servant is really like, Sovereign 
2SA.7.21	Because of your promise and according to your will, you have done all these great things and have made them known to your servant.
2SA.7.22	“How great you are, O Sovereign 
2SA.7.23	What other nation on earth is like your people Israel? What other nation, O God, have you redeemed from slavery to be your own people? You made a great name for yourself when you redeemed your people from Egypt. You performed awesome miracles and drove out the nations and gods that stood in their way.
2SA.7.24	You made Israel your very own people forever, and you, O 
2SA.7.25	“And now, O 
2SA.7.26	And may your name be honored forever so that everyone will say, ‘The 
2SA.7.27	“O 
2SA.7.28	For you are God, O Sovereign 
2SA.7.29	And now, may it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you have spoken, and when you grant a blessing to your servant, O Sovereign 
2SA.8.1	After this, David defeated and subdued the Philistines by conquering Gath, their largest town.
2SA.8.2	David also conquered the land of Moab. He made the people lie down on the ground in a row, and he measured them off in groups with a length of rope. He measured off two groups to be executed for every one group to be spared. The Moabites who were spared became David’s subjects and paid him tribute money.
2SA.8.3	David also destroyed the forces of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when Hadadezer marched out to strengthen his control along the Euphrates River. 
2SA.8.4	David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 charioteers,
2SA.8.5	When Arameans from Damascus arrived to help King Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them. 
2SA.8.6	Then he placed several army garrisons in Damascus, the Aramean capital, and the Arameans became David’s subjects and paid him tribute money. So the 
2SA.8.7	David brought the gold shields of Hadadezer’s officers to Jerusalem, 
2SA.8.8	along with a large amount of bronze from Hadadezer’s towns of Tebah
2SA.8.9	When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had destroyed the entire army of Hadadezer, 
2SA.8.10	he sent his son Joram to congratulate King David for his successful campaign. Hadadezer and Toi had been enemies and were often at war. Joram presented David with many gifts of silver, gold, and bronze.
2SA.8.11	King David dedicated all these gifts to the 
2SA.8.12	from Edom,
2SA.8.13	So David became even more famous when he returned from destroying 18,000 Edomites
2SA.8.14	He placed army garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s subjects. In fact, the 
2SA.8.15	So David reigned over all Israel and did what was just and right for all his people. 
2SA.8.16	Joab son of Zeruiah was commander of the army. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the royal historian. 
2SA.8.17	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were the priests. Seraiah was the court secretary. 
2SA.8.18	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king’s bodyguard.
2SA.9.1	One day David asked, “Is anyone in Saul’s family still alive—anyone to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 
2SA.9.2	He summoned a man named Ziba, who had been one of Saul’s servants. “Are you Ziba?” the king asked.
2SA.9.2	“Yes sir, I am,” Ziba replied.
2SA.9.3	The king then asked him, “Is anyone still alive from Saul’s family? If so, I want to show God’s kindness to them.”
2SA.9.3	Ziba replied, “Yes, one of Jonathan’s sons is still alive. He is crippled in both feet.”
2SA.9.4	“Where is he?” the king asked.
2SA.9.4	“In Lo-debar,” Ziba told him, “at the home of Makir son of Ammiel.”
2SA.9.5	So David sent for him and brought him from Makir’s home. 
2SA.9.6	His name was Mephibosheth
2SA.9.6	Mephibosheth replied, “I am your servant.”
2SA.9.7	“Don’t be afraid!” David said. “I intend to show kindness to you because of my promise to your father, Jonathan. I will give you all the property that once belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will eat here with me at the king’s table!”
2SA.9.8	Mephibosheth bowed respectfully and exclaimed, “Who is your servant, that you should show such kindness to a dead dog like me?”
2SA.9.9	Then the king summoned Saul’s servant Ziba and said, “I have given your master’s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family. 
2SA.9.10	You and your sons and servants are to farm the land for him to produce food for your master’s household.
2SA.9.11	Ziba replied, “Yes, my lord the king; I am your servant, and I will do all that you have commanded.” And from that time on, Mephibosheth ate regularly at David’s table,
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. From then on, all the members of Ziba’s household were Mephibosheth’s servants. 
2SA.9.13	And Mephibosheth, who was crippled in both feet, lived in Jerusalem and ate regularly at the king’s table.
2SA.10.1	Some time after this, King Nahash
2SA.10.2	David said, “I am going to show loyalty to Hanun just as his father, Nahash, was always loyal to me.” So David sent ambassadors to express sympathy to Hanun about his father’s death.
2SA.10.2	But when David’s ambassadors arrived in the land of Ammon, 
2SA.10.3	the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, their master, “Do you really think these men are coming here to honor your father? No! David has sent them to spy out the city so they can come in and conquer it!” 
2SA.10.4	So Hanun seized David’s ambassadors and shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their robes at the buttocks, and sent them back to David in shame.
2SA.10.5	When David heard what had happened, he sent messengers to tell the men, “Stay at Jericho until your beards grow out, and then come back.” For they felt deep shame because of their appearance.
2SA.10.6	When the people of Ammon realized how seriously they had angered David, they sent and hired 20,000 Aramean foot soldiers from the lands of Beth-rehob and Zobah, 1,000 from the king of Maacah, and 12,000 from the land of Tob. 
2SA.10.7	When David heard about this, he sent Joab and all his warriors to fight them. 
2SA.10.8	The Ammonite troops came out and drew up their battle lines at the entrance of the city gate, while the Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the men from Tob and Maacah positioned themselves to fight in the open fields.
2SA.10.9	When Joab saw that he would have to fight on both the front and the rear, he chose some of Israel’s elite troops and placed them under his personal command to fight the Arameans in the fields. 
2SA.10.10	He left the rest of the army under the command of his brother Abishai, who was to attack the Ammonites. 
2SA.10.11	“If the Arameans are too strong for me, then come over and help me,” Joab told his brother. “And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will come and help you. 
2SA.10.12	Be courageous! Let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. May the 
2SA.10.13	When Joab and his troops attacked, the Arameans began to run away. 
2SA.10.14	And when the Ammonites saw the Arameans running, they ran from Abishai and retreated into the city. After the battle was over, Joab returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	The Arameans now realized that they were no match for Israel. So when they regrouped, 
2SA.10.16	they were joined by additional Aramean troops summoned by Hadadezer from the other side of the Euphrates River.
2SA.10.17	When David heard what was happening, he mobilized all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and led the army to Helam. The Arameans positioned themselves in battle formation and fought against David. 
2SA.10.18	But again the Arameans fled from the Israelites. This time David’s forces killed 700 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers,
2SA.10.19	When all the kings allied with Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they surrendered to Israel and became their subjects. After that, the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites.
2SA.11.1	In the spring of the year,
2SA.11.2	Late one afternoon, after his midday rest, David got out of bed and was walking on the roof of the palace. As he looked out over the city, he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath. 
2SA.11.3	He sent someone to find out who she was, and he was told, “She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” 
2SA.11.4	Then David sent messengers to get her; and when she came to the palace, he slept with her. She had just completed the purification rites after having her menstrual period. Then she returned home. 
2SA.11.5	Later, when Bathsheba discovered that she was pregnant, she sent David a message, saying, “I’m pregnant.”
2SA.11.6	Then David sent word to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent him to David. 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab and the army were getting along and how the war was progressing. 
2SA.11.8	Then he told Uriah, “Go on home and relax.
2SA.11.9	But Uriah didn’t go home. He slept that night at the palace entrance with the king’s palace guard.
2SA.11.10	When David heard that Uriah had not gone home, he summoned him and asked, “What’s the matter? Why didn’t you go home last night after being away for so long?”
2SA.11.11	Uriah replied, “The Ark and the armies of Israel and Judah are living in tents,
2SA.11.12	“Well, stay here today,” David told him, “and tomorrow you may return to the army.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
2SA.11.13	Then David invited him to dinner and got him drunk. But even then he couldn’t get Uriah to go home to his wife. Again he slept at the palace entrance with the king’s palace guard.
2SA.11.14	So the next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and gave it to Uriah to deliver. 
2SA.11.15	The letter instructed Joab, “Station Uriah on the front lines where the battle is fiercest. Then pull back so that he will be killed.” 
2SA.11.16	So Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the city wall where he knew the enemy’s strongest men were fighting. 
2SA.11.17	And when the enemy soldiers came out of the city to fight, Uriah the Hittite was killed along with several other Israelite soldiers.
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent a battle report to David. 
2SA.11.19	He told his messenger, “Report all the news of the battle to the king. 
2SA.11.20	But he might get angry and ask, ‘Why did the troops go so close to the city? Didn’t they know there would be shooting from the walls? 
2SA.11.21	Wasn’t Abimelech son of Gideon
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went to Jerusalem and gave a complete report to David. 
2SA.11.23	“The enemy came out against us in the open fields,” he said. “And as we chased them back to the city gate, 
2SA.11.24	the archers on the wall shot arrows at us. Some of the king’s men were killed, including Uriah the Hittite.”
2SA.11.25	“Well, tell Joab not to be discouraged,” David said. “The sword devours this one today and that one tomorrow! Fight harder next time, and conquer the city!”
2SA.11.26	When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. 
2SA.11.27	When the period of mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to the palace, and she became one of his wives. Then she gave birth to a son. But the 
2SA.12.1	So the 
2SA.12.2	The rich man owned a great many sheep and cattle. 
2SA.12.3	The poor man owned nothing but one little lamb he had bought. He raised that little lamb, and it grew up with his children. It ate from the man’s own plate and drank from his cup. He cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter. 
2SA.12.4	One day a guest arrived at the home of the rich man. But instead of killing an animal from his own flock or herd, he took the poor man’s lamb and killed it and prepared it for his guest.”
2SA.12.5	David was furious. “As surely as the 
2SA.12.6	He must repay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole and for having no pity.”
2SA.12.7	Then Nathan said to David, “You are that man! The 
2SA.12.8	I gave you your master’s house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. And if that had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more. 
2SA.12.9	Why, then, have you despised the word of the 
2SA.12.10	From this time on, your family will live by the sword because you have despised me by taking Uriah’s wife to be your own.
2SA.12.11	“This is what the 
2SA.12.12	You did it secretly, but I will make this happen to you openly in the sight of all Israel.”
2SA.12.13	Then David confessed to Nathan, “I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.13	Nathan replied, “Yes, but the 
2SA.12.14	Nevertheless, because you have shown utter contempt for the word of the 
2SA.12.15	After Nathan returned to his home, the 
2SA.12.16	David begged God to spare the child. He went without food and lay all night on the bare ground. 
2SA.12.17	The elders of his household pleaded with him to get up and eat with them, but he refused.
2SA.12.18	Then on the seventh day the child died. David’s advisers were afraid to tell him. “He wouldn’t listen to reason while the child was ill,” they said. “What drastic thing will he do when we tell him the child is dead?”
2SA.12.19	When David saw them whispering, he realized what had happened. “Is the child dead?” he asked.
2SA.12.19	“Yes,” they replied, “he is dead.”
2SA.12.20	Then David got up from the ground, washed himself, put on lotions,
2SA.12.21	His advisers were amazed. “We don’t understand you,” they told him. “While the child was still living, you wept and refused to eat. But now that the child is dead, you have stopped your mourning and are eating again.”
2SA.12.22	David replied, “I fasted and wept while the child was alive, for I said, ‘Perhaps the 
2SA.12.23	But why should I fast when he is dead? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him one day, but he cannot return to me.”
2SA.12.24	Then David comforted Bathsheba, his wife, and slept with her. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and David
2SA.12.25	and sent word through Nathan the prophet that they should name him Jedidiah (which means “beloved of the 
2SA.12.26	Meanwhile, Joab was fighting against Rabbah, the capital of Ammon, and he captured the royal fortifications.
2SA.12.27	Joab sent messengers to tell David, “I have fought against Rabbah and captured its water supply.
2SA.12.28	Now bring the rest of the army and capture the city. Otherwise, I will capture it and get credit for the victory.”
2SA.12.29	So David gathered the rest of the army and went to Rabbah, and he fought against it and captured it. 
2SA.12.30	David removed the crown from the king’s head,
2SA.12.31	He also made slaves of the people of Rabbah and forced them to labor with
2SA.13.1	Now David’s son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. And Amnon, her half brother, fell desperately in love with her. 
2SA.13.2	Amnon became so obsessed with Tamar that he became ill. She was a virgin, and Amnon thought he could never have her.
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a very crafty friend—his cousin Jonadab. He was the son of David’s brother Shimea.
2SA.13.4	One day Jonadab said to Amnon, “What’s the trouble? Why should the son of a king look so dejected morning after morning?”
2SA.13.4	So Amnon told him, “I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”
2SA.13.5	“Well,” Jonadab said, “I’ll tell you what to do. Go back to bed and pretend you are ill. When your father comes to see you, ask him to let Tamar come and prepare some food for you. Tell him you’ll feel better if she prepares it as you watch and feeds you with her own hands.”
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. And when the king came to see him, Amnon asked him, “Please let my sister Tamar come and cook my favorite dish
2SA.13.7	So David agreed and sent Tamar to Amnon’s house to prepare some food for him.
2SA.13.8	When Tamar arrived at Amnon’s house, she went to the place where he was lying down so he could watch her mix some dough. Then she baked his favorite dish for him. 
2SA.13.9	But when she set the serving tray before him, he refused to eat. “Everyone get out of here,” Amnon told his servants. So they all left.
2SA.13.10	Then he said to Tamar, “Now bring the food into my bedroom and feed it to me here.” So Tamar took his favorite dish to him. 
2SA.13.11	But as she was feeding him, he grabbed her and demanded, “Come to bed with me, my darling sister.”
2SA.13.12	“No, my brother!” she cried. “Don’t be foolish! Don’t do this to me! Such wicked things aren’t done in Israel. 
2SA.13.13	Where could I go in my shame? And you would be called one of the greatest fools in Israel. Please, just speak to the king about it, and he will let you marry me.”
2SA.13.14	But Amnon wouldn’t listen to her, and since he was stronger than she was, he raped her. 
2SA.13.15	Then suddenly Amnon’s love turned to hate, and he hated her even more than he had loved her. “Get out of here!” he snarled at her.
2SA.13.16	“No, no!” Tamar cried. “Sending me away now is worse than what you’ve already done to me.”
2SA.13.16	But Amnon wouldn’t listen to her. 
2SA.13.17	He shouted for his servant and demanded, “Throw this woman out, and lock the door behind her!”
2SA.13.18	So the servant put her out and locked the door behind her. She was wearing a long, beautiful robe,
2SA.13.19	But now Tamar tore her robe and put ashes on her head. And then, with her face in her hands, she went away crying.
2SA.13.20	Her brother Absalom saw her and asked, “Is it true that Amnon has been with you? Well, my sister, keep quiet for now, since he’s your brother. Don’t you worry about it.” So Tamar lived as a desolate woman in her brother Absalom’s house.
2SA.13.21	When King David heard what had happened, he was very angry.
2SA.13.22	And though Absalom never spoke to Amnon about this, he hated Amnon deeply because of what he had done to his sister.
2SA.13.23	Two years later, when Absalom’s sheep were being sheared at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, Absalom invited all the king’s sons to come to a feast. 
2SA.13.24	He went to the king and said, “My sheep-shearers are now at work. Would the king and his servants please come to celebrate the occasion with me?”
2SA.13.25	The king replied, “No, my son. If we all came, we would be too much of a burden on you.” Absalom pressed him, but the king would not come, though he gave Absalom his blessing.
2SA.13.26	“Well, then,” Absalom said, “if you can’t come, how about sending my brother Amnon with us?”
2SA.13.26	“Why Amnon?” the king asked. 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom kept on pressing the king until he finally agreed to let all his sons attend, including Amnon. So Absalom prepared a feast fit for a king.
2SA.13.28	Absalom told his men, “Wait until Amnon gets drunk; then at my signal, kill him! Don’t be afraid. I’m the one who has given the command. Take courage and do it!” 
2SA.13.29	So at Absalom’s signal they murdered Amnon. Then the other sons of the king jumped on their mules and fled.
2SA.13.30	As they were on the way back to Jerusalem, this report reached David: “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons; not one is left alive!” 
2SA.13.31	The king got up, tore his robe, and threw himself on the ground. His advisers also tore their clothes in horror and sorrow.
2SA.13.32	But just then Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimea, arrived and said, “No, don’t believe that all the king’s sons have been killed! It was only Amnon! Absalom has been plotting this ever since Amnon raped his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.33	No, my lord the king, your sons aren’t all dead! It was only Amnon.” 
2SA.13.34	Meanwhile Absalom escaped.
2SA.13.34	Then the watchman on the Jerusalem wall saw a great crowd coming down the hill on the road from the west. He ran to tell the king, “I see a crowd of people coming from the Horonaim road along the side of the hill.”
2SA.13.35	“Look!” Jonadab told the king. “There they are now! The king’s sons are coming, just as I said.”
2SA.13.36	They soon arrived, weeping and sobbing, and the king and all his servants wept bitterly with them. 
2SA.13.37	And David mourned many days for his son Amnon.
2SA.13.37	Absalom fled to his grandfather, Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. 
2SA.13.38	He stayed there in Geshur for three years. 
2SA.13.39	And King David,
2SA.14.1	Joab realized how much the king longed to see Absalom. 
2SA.14.2	So he sent for a woman from Tekoa who had a reputation for great wisdom. He said to her, “Pretend you are in mourning; wear mourning clothes and don’t put on lotions.
2SA.14.3	Then go to the king and tell him the story I am about to tell you.” Then Joab told her what to say.
2SA.14.4	When the woman from Tekoa approached
2SA.14.5	“What’s the trouble?” the king asked.
2SA.14.5	“Alas, I am a widow!” she replied. “My husband is dead. 
2SA.14.6	My two sons had a fight out in the field. And since no one was there to stop it, one of them was killed. 
2SA.14.7	Now the rest of the family is demanding, ‘Let us have your son. We will execute him for murdering his brother. He doesn’t deserve to inherit his family’s property.’ They want to extinguish the only coal I have left, and my husband’s name and family will disappear from the face of the earth.”
2SA.14.8	“Leave it to me,” the king told her. “Go home, and I’ll see to it that no one touches him.”
2SA.14.9	“Oh, thank you, my lord the king,” the woman from Tekoa replied. “If you are criticized for helping me, let the blame fall on me and on my father’s house, and let the king and his throne be innocent.”
2SA.14.10	“If anyone objects,” the king said, “bring him to me. I can assure you he will never harm you again!”
2SA.14.11	Then she said, “Please swear to me by the 
2SA.14.11	“As surely as the 
2SA.14.12	“Please allow me to ask one more thing of my lord the king,” she said.
2SA.14.12	“Go ahead and speak,” he responded.
2SA.14.13	She replied, “Why don’t you do as much for the people of God as you have promised to do for me? You have convicted yourself in making this decision, because you have refused to bring home your own banished son. 
2SA.14.14	All of us must die eventually. Our lives are like water spilled out on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not just sweep life away; instead, he devises ways to bring us back when we have been separated from him.
2SA.14.15	“I have come to plead with my lord the king because people have threatened me. I said to myself, ‘Perhaps the king will listen to me 
2SA.14.16	and rescue us from those who would cut us off from the inheritance
2SA.14.17	Yes, my lord the king will give us peace of mind again.’ I know that you are like an angel of God in discerning good from evil. May the 
2SA.14.18	“I must know one thing,” the king replied, “and tell me the truth.”
2SA.14.18	“Yes, my lord the king,” she responded.
2SA.14.19	“Did Joab put you up to this?”
2SA.14.19	And the woman replied, “My lord the king, how can I deny it? Nobody can hide anything from you. Yes, Joab sent me and told me what to say. 
2SA.14.20	He did it to place the matter before you in a different light. But you are as wise as an angel of God, and you understand everything that happens among us!”
2SA.14.21	So the king sent for Joab and told him, “All right, go and bring back the young man Absalom.”
2SA.14.22	Joab bowed with his face to the ground in deep respect and said, “At last I know that I have gained your approval, my lord the king, for you have granted me this request!”
2SA.14.23	Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	But the king gave this order: “Absalom may go to his own house, but he must never come into my presence.” So Absalom did not see the king.
2SA.14.25	Now Absalom was praised as the most handsome man in all Israel. He was flawless from head to foot. 
2SA.14.26	He cut his hair only once a year, and then only because it was so heavy. When he weighed it out, it came to five pounds!
2SA.14.27	He had three sons and one daughter. His daughter’s name was Tamar, and she was very beautiful.
2SA.14.28	Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years, but he never got to see the king. 
2SA.14.29	Then Absalom sent for Joab to ask him to intercede for him, but Joab refused to come. Absalom sent for him a second time, but again Joab refused to come. 
2SA.14.30	So Absalom said to his servants, “Go and set fire to Joab’s barley field, the field next to mine.” So they set his field on fire, as Absalom had commanded.
2SA.14.31	Then Joab came to Absalom at his house and demanded, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?”
2SA.14.32	And Absalom replied, “Because I wanted you to ask the king why he brought me back from Geshur if he didn’t intend to see me. I might as well have stayed there. Let me see the king; if he finds me guilty of anything, then let him kill me.”
2SA.14.33	So Joab told the king what Absalom had said. Then at last David summoned Absalom, who came and bowed low before the king, and the king kissed him.
2SA.15.1	After this, Absalom bought a chariot and horses, and he hired fifty bodyguards to run ahead of him. 
2SA.15.2	He got up early every morning and went out to the gate of the city. When people brought a case to the king for judgment, Absalom would ask where in Israel they were from, and they would tell him their tribe. 
2SA.15.3	Then Absalom would say, “You’ve really got a strong case here! It’s too bad the king doesn’t have anyone to hear it. 
2SA.15.4	I wish I were the judge. Then everyone could bring their cases to me for judgment, and I would give them justice!”
2SA.15.5	When people tried to bow before him, Absalom wouldn’t let them. Instead, he took them by the hand and kissed them. 
2SA.15.6	Absalom did this with everyone who came to the king for judgment, and so he stole the hearts of all the people of Israel.
2SA.15.7	After four years,
2SA.15.8	For while your servant was at Geshur in Aram, I promised to sacrifice to the 
2SA.15.9	“All right,” the king told him. “Go and fulfill your vow.”
2SA.15.9	So Absalom went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	But while he was there, he sent secret messengers to all the tribes of Israel to stir up a rebellion against the king. “As soon as you hear the ram’s horn,” his message read, “you are to say, ‘Absalom has been crowned king in Hebron.’” 
2SA.15.11	He took 200 men from Jerusalem with him as guests, but they knew nothing of his intentions. 
2SA.15.12	While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel, one of David’s counselors who lived in Giloh. Soon many others also joined Absalom, and the conspiracy gained momentum.
2SA.15.13	A messenger soon arrived in Jerusalem to tell David, “All Israel has joined Absalom in a conspiracy against you!”
2SA.15.14	“Then we must flee at once, or it will be too late!” David urged his men. “Hurry! If we get out of the city before Absalom arrives, both we and the city of Jerusalem will be spared from disaster.”
2SA.15.15	“We are with you,” his advisers replied. “Do what you think is best.”
2SA.15.16	So the king and all his household set out at once. He left no one behind except ten of his concubines to look after the palace. 
2SA.15.17	The king and all his people set out on foot, pausing at the last house 
2SA.15.18	to let all the king’s men move past to lead the way. There were 600 men from Gath who had come with David, along with the king’s bodyguard.
2SA.15.19	Then the king turned and said to Ittai, a leader of the men from Gath, “Why are you coming with us? Go on back to King Absalom, for you are a guest in Israel, a foreigner in exile. 
2SA.15.20	You arrived only recently, and should I force you today to wander with us? I don’t even know where we will go. Go on back and take your kinsmen with you, and may the 
2SA.15.21	But Ittai said to the king, “I vow by the 
2SA.15.22	David replied, “All right, come with us.” So Ittai and all his men and their families went along.
2SA.15.23	Everyone cried loudly as the king and his followers passed by. They crossed the Kidron Valley and then went out toward the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	Zadok and all the Levites also came along, carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God. They set down the Ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices
2SA.15.25	Then the king instructed Zadok to take the Ark of God back into the city. “If the 
2SA.15.26	But if he is through with me, then let him do what seems best to him.”
2SA.15.27	The king also told Zadok the priest, “Look,
2SA.15.28	I will stop at the shallows of the Jordan River
2SA.15.29	So Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of God back to the city and stayed there.
2SA.15.30	David walked up the road to the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went. His head was covered and his feet were bare as a sign of mourning. And the people who were with him covered their heads and wept as they climbed the hill. 
2SA.15.31	When someone told David that his adviser Ahithophel was now backing Absalom, David prayed, “O 
2SA.15.32	When David reached the summit of the Mount of Olives where people worshiped God, Hushai the Arkite was waiting there for him. Hushai had torn his clothing and put dirt on his head as a sign of mourning. 
2SA.15.33	But David told him, “If you go with me, you will only be a burden. 
2SA.15.34	Return to Jerusalem and tell Absalom, ‘I will now be your adviser, O king, just as I was your father’s adviser in the past.’ Then you can frustrate and counter Ahithophel’s advice. 
2SA.15.35	Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, will be there. Tell them about the plans being made in the king’s palace, 
2SA.15.36	and they will send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to tell me what is going on.”
2SA.15.37	So David’s friend Hushai returned to Jerusalem, getting there just as Absalom arrived.
2SA.16.1	When David had gone a little beyond the summit of the Mount of Olives, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth,
2SA.16.2	“What are these for?” the king asked Ziba.
2SA.16.2	Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s people to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat. The wine is for those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”
2SA.16.3	“And where is Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson?” the king asked him.
2SA.16.3	“He stayed in Jerusalem,” Ziba replied. “He said, ‘Today I will get back the kingdom of my grandfather Saul.’”
2SA.16.4	“In that case,” the king told Ziba, “I give you everything Mephibosheth owns.”
2SA.16.4	“I bow before you,” Ziba replied. “May I always be pleasing to you, my lord the king.”
2SA.16.5	As King David came to Bahurim, a man came out of the village cursing them. It was Shimei son of Gera, from the same clan as Saul’s family. 
2SA.16.6	He threw stones at the king and the king’s officers and all the mighty warriors who surrounded him. 
2SA.16.7	“Get out of here, you murderer, you scoundrel!” he shouted at David. 
2SA.16.8	“The 
2SA.16.9	“Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?” Abishai son of Zeruiah demanded. “Let me go over and cut off his head!”
2SA.16.10	“No!” the king said. “Who asked your opinion, you sons of Zeruiah! If the 
2SA.16.11	Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “My own son is trying to kill me. Doesn’t this relative of Saul
2SA.16.12	And perhaps the 
2SA.16.13	So David and his men continued down the road, and Shimei kept pace with them on a nearby hillside, cursing and throwing stones and dirt at David.
2SA.16.14	The king and all who were with him grew weary along the way, so they rested when they reached the Jordan River.
2SA.16.15	Meanwhile, Absalom and all the army of Israel arrived at Jerusalem, accompanied by Ahithophel. 
2SA.16.16	When David’s friend Hushai the Arkite arrived, he went immediately to see Absalom. “Long live the king!” he exclaimed. “Long live the king!”
2SA.16.17	“Is this the way you treat your friend David?” Absalom asked him. “Why aren’t you with him?”
2SA.16.18	“I’m here because I belong to the man who is chosen by the 
2SA.16.19	“And anyway, why shouldn’t I serve you? Just as I was your father’s adviser, now I will be your adviser!”
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and asked him, “What should I do next?”
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel told him, “Go and sleep with your father’s concubines, for he has left them here to look after the palace. Then all Israel will know that you have insulted your father beyond hope of reconciliation, and they will throw their support to you.” 
2SA.16.22	So they set up a tent on the palace roof where everyone could see it, and Absalom went in and had sex with his father’s concubines.
2SA.16.23	Absalom followed Ahithophel’s advice, just as David had done. For every word Ahithophel spoke seemed as wise as though it had come directly from the mouth of God.
2SA.17.1	Now Ahithophel urged Absalom, “Let me choose 12,000 men to start out after David tonight. 
2SA.17.2	I will catch up with him while he is weary and discouraged. He and his troops will panic, and everyone will run away. Then I will kill only the king, 
2SA.17.3	and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride returns to her husband. After all, it is only one man’s life that you seek.
2SA.17.4	This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.
2SA.17.5	But then Absalom said, “Bring in Hushai the Arkite. Let’s see what he thinks about this.” 
2SA.17.6	When Hushai arrived, Absalom told him what Ahithophel had said. Then he asked, “What is your opinion? Should we follow Ahithophel’s advice? If not, what do you suggest?”
2SA.17.7	“Well,” Hushai replied to Absalom, “this time Ahithophel has made a mistake. 
2SA.17.8	You know your father and his men; they are mighty warriors. Right now they are as enraged as a mother bear who has been robbed of her cubs. And remember that your father is an experienced man of war. He won’t be spending the night among the troops. 
2SA.17.9	He has probably already hidden in some pit or cave. And when he comes out and attacks and a few of your men fall, there will be panic among your troops, and the word will spread that Absalom’s men are being slaughtered. 
2SA.17.10	Then even the bravest soldiers, though they have the heart of a lion, will be paralyzed with fear. For all Israel knows what a mighty warrior your father is and how courageous his men are.
2SA.17.11	“I recommend that you mobilize the entire army of Israel, bringing them from as far away as Dan in the north and Beersheba in the south. That way you will have an army as numerous as the sand on the seashore. And I advise that you personally lead the troops. 
2SA.17.12	When we find David, we’ll fall on him like dew that falls on the ground. Then neither he nor any of his men will be left alive. 
2SA.17.13	And if David were to escape into some town, you will have all Israel there at your command. Then we can take ropes and drag the walls of the town into the nearest valley until every stone is torn down.”
2SA.17.14	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “Hushai’s advice is better than Ahithophel’s.” For the 
2SA.17.15	Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, what Ahithophel had said to Absalom and the elders of Israel and what he himself had advised instead. 
2SA.17.16	“Quick!” he told them. “Find David and urge him not to stay at the shallows of the Jordan River
2SA.17.17	Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been staying at En-rogel so as not to be seen entering and leaving the city. Arrangements had been made for a servant girl to bring them the message they were to take to King David. 
2SA.17.18	But a boy spotted them at En-rogel, and he told Absalom about it. So they quickly escaped to Bahurim, where a man hid them down inside a well in his courtyard. 
2SA.17.19	The man’s wife put a cloth over the top of the well and scattered grain on it to dry in the sun; so no one suspected they were there.
2SA.17.20	When Absalom’s men arrived, they asked her, “Have you seen Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
2SA.17.20	The woman replied, “They were here, but they crossed over the brook.” Absalom’s men looked for them without success and returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.17.21	Then the two men crawled out of the well and hurried on to King David. “Quick!” they told him, “cross the Jordan tonight!” And they told him how Ahithophel had advised that he be captured and killed. 
2SA.17.22	So David and all the people with him went across the Jordan River during the night, and they were all on the other bank before dawn.
2SA.17.23	When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey, went to his hometown, set his affairs in order, and hanged himself. He died there and was buried in the family tomb.
2SA.17.24	David soon arrived at Mahanaim. By now, Absalom had mobilized the entire army of Israel and was leading his troops across the Jordan River. 
2SA.17.25	Absalom had appointed Amasa as commander of his army, replacing Joab, who had been commander under David. (Amasa was Joab’s cousin. His father was Jether,
2SA.17.26	Absalom and the Israelite army set up camp in the land of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	When David arrived at Mahanaim, he was warmly greeted by Shobi son of Nahash, who came from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and by Makir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and by Barzillai of Gilead from Rogelim. 
2SA.17.28	They brought sleeping mats, cooking pots, serving bowls, wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans, lentils, 
2SA.17.29	honey, butter, sheep, goats, and cheese for David and those who were with him. For they said, “You must all be very hungry and tired and thirsty after your long march through the wilderness.”
2SA.18.1	David now mustered the men who were with him and appointed generals and captains
2SA.18.2	He sent the troops out in three groups, placing one group under Joab, one under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and one under Ittai, the man from Gath. The king told his troops, “I am going out with you.”
2SA.18.3	But his men objected strongly. “You must not go,” they urged. “If we have to turn and run—and even if half of us die—it will make no difference to Absalom’s troops; they will be looking only for you. You are worth 10,000 of us,
2SA.18.4	“If you think that’s the best plan, I’ll do it,” the king answered. So he stood alongside the gate of the town as all the troops marched out in groups of hundreds and of thousands.
2SA.18.5	And the king gave this command to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: “For my sake, deal gently with young Absalom.” And all the troops heard the king give this order to his commanders.
2SA.18.6	So the battle began in the forest of Ephraim, 
2SA.18.7	and the Israelite troops were beaten back by David’s men. There was a great slaughter that day, and 20,000 men laid down their lives. 
2SA.18.8	The battle raged all across the countryside, and more men died because of the forest than were killed by the sword.
2SA.18.9	During the battle, Absalom happened to come upon some of David’s men. He tried to escape on his mule, but as he rode beneath the thick branches of a great tree, his hair
2SA.18.10	One of David’s men saw what had happened and told Joab, “I saw Absalom dangling from a great tree.”
2SA.18.11	“What?” Joab demanded. “You saw him there and didn’t kill him? I would have rewarded you with ten pieces of silver
2SA.18.12	“I would not kill the king’s son for even a thousand pieces of silver,
2SA.18.13	And if I had betrayed the king by killing his son—and the king would certainly find out who did it—you yourself would be the first to abandon me.”
2SA.18.14	“Enough of this nonsense,” Joab said. Then he took three daggers and plunged them into Absalom’s heart as he dangled, still alive, in the great tree. 
2SA.18.15	Ten of Joab’s young armor bearers then surrounded Absalom and killed him.
2SA.18.16	Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and his men returned from chasing the army of Israel. 
2SA.18.17	They threw Absalom’s body into a deep pit in the forest and piled a great heap of stones over it. And all Israel fled to their homes.
2SA.18.18	During his lifetime, Absalom had built a monument to himself in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to carry on my name.” He named the monument after himself, and it is known as Absalom’s Monument to this day.
2SA.18.19	Then Zadok’s son Ahimaaz said, “Let me run to the king with the good news that the 
2SA.18.20	“No,” Joab told him, “it wouldn’t be good news to the king that his son is dead. You can be my messenger another time, but not today.”
2SA.18.21	Then Joab said to a man from Ethiopia,
2SA.18.22	But Ahimaaz continued to plead with Joab, “Whatever happens, please let me go, too.”
2SA.18.22	“Why should you go, my son?” Joab replied. “There will be no reward for your news.”
2SA.18.23	“Yes, but let me go anyway,” he begged.
2SA.18.23	Joab finally said, “All right, go ahead.” So Ahimaaz took the less demanding route by way of the plain and ran to Mahanaim ahead of the Ethiopian.
2SA.18.24	While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town, the watchman climbed to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked, he saw a lone man running toward them. 
2SA.18.25	He shouted the news down to David, and the king replied, “If he is alone, he has news.”
2SA.18.25	As the messenger came closer, 
2SA.18.26	the watchman saw another man running toward them. He shouted down, “Here comes another one!”
2SA.18.26	The king replied, “He also will have news.”
2SA.18.27	“The first man runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok,” the watchman said.
2SA.18.27	“He is a good man and comes with good news,” the king replied.
2SA.18.28	Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, “Everything is all right!” He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Praise to the 
2SA.18.29	“What about young Absalom?” the king demanded. “Is he all right?”
2SA.18.29	Ahimaaz replied, “When Joab told me to come, there was a lot of commotion. But I didn’t know what was happening.”
2SA.18.30	“Wait here,” the king told him. So Ahimaaz stepped aside.
2SA.18.31	Then the man from Ethiopia arrived and said, “I have good news for my lord the king. Today the 
2SA.18.32	“What about young Absalom?” the king demanded. “Is he all right?”
2SA.18.32	And the Ethiopian replied, “May all of your enemies, my lord the king, both now and in the future, share the fate of that young man!”
2SA.18.33	The king was overcome with emotion. He went up to the room over the gateway and burst into tears. And as he went, he cried, “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you! O Absalom, my son, my son.”
2SA.19.1	Word soon reached Joab that the king was weeping and mourning for Absalom. 
2SA.19.2	As all the people heard of the king’s deep grief for his son, the joy of that day’s victory was turned into deep sadness. 
2SA.19.3	They crept back into the town that day as though they were ashamed and had deserted in battle. 
2SA.19.4	The king covered his face with his hands and kept on crying, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.5	Then Joab went to the king’s room and said to him, “We saved your life today and the lives of your sons, your daughters, and your wives and concubines. Yet you act like this, making us feel ashamed of ourselves. 
2SA.19.6	You seem to love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that your commanders and troops mean nothing to you. It seems that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died, you would be pleased. 
2SA.19.7	Now go out there and congratulate your troops, for I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	So the king went out and took his seat at the town gate, and as the news spread throughout the town that he was there, everyone went to him.
2SA.19.8	Meanwhile, the Israelites who had supported Absalom fled to their homes. 
2SA.19.9	And throughout all the tribes of Israel there was much discussion and argument going on. The people were saying, “The king rescued us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines, but Absalom chased him out of the country. 
2SA.19.10	Now Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, is dead. Why not ask David to come back and be our king again?”
2SA.19.11	Then King David sent Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, to say to the elders of Judah, “Why are you the last ones to welcome back the king into his palace? For I have heard that all Israel is ready. 
2SA.19.12	You are my relatives, my own tribe, my own flesh and blood! So why are you the last ones to welcome back the king?” 
2SA.19.13	And David told them to tell Amasa, “Since you are my own flesh and blood, like Joab, may God strike me and even kill me if I do not appoint you as commander of my army in his place.”
2SA.19.14	Then Amasa
2SA.19.15	So the king started back to Jerusalem. And when he arrived at the Jordan River, the people of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across the river. 
2SA.19.16	Shimei son of Gera, the man from Bahurim in Benjamin, hurried across with the men of Judah to welcome King David. 
2SA.19.17	A thousand other men from the tribe of Benjamin were with him, including Ziba, the chief servant of the house of Saul, and Ziba’s fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed down to the Jordan to meet the king. 
2SA.19.18	They crossed the shallows of the Jordan to bring the king’s household across the river, helping him in every way they could.
2SA.19.18	As the king was about to cross the river, Shimei fell down before him. 
2SA.19.19	“My lord the king, please forgive me,” he pleaded. “Forget the terrible thing your servant did when you left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind. 
2SA.19.20	I know how much I sinned. That is why I have come here today, the very first person in all Israel
2SA.19.21	Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shimei should die, for he cursed the 
2SA.19.22	“Who asked your opinion, you sons of Zeruiah!” David exclaimed. “Why have you become my adversary
2SA.19.23	Then, turning to Shimei, David vowed, “Your life will be spared.”
2SA.19.24	Now Mephibosheth,
2SA.19.25	“Why didn’t you come with me, Mephibosheth?” the king asked him.
2SA.19.26	Mephibosheth replied, “My lord the king, my servant Ziba deceived me. I told him, ‘Saddle my donkey
2SA.19.27	Ziba has slandered me by saying that I refused to come. But I know that my lord the king is like an angel of God, so do what you think is best. 
2SA.19.28	All my relatives and I could expect only death from you, my lord, but instead you have honored me by allowing me to eat at your own table! What more can I ask?”
2SA.19.29	“You’ve said enough,” David replied. “I’ve decided that you and Ziba will divide your land equally between you.”
2SA.19.30	“Give him all of it,” Mephibosheth said. “I am content just to have you safely back again, my lord the king!”
2SA.19.31	Barzillai of Gilead had come down from Rogelim to escort the king across the Jordan. 
2SA.19.32	He was very old—eighty years of age—and very wealthy. He was the one who had provided food for the king during his stay in Mahanaim. 
2SA.19.33	“Come across with me and live in Jerusalem,” the king said to Barzillai. “I will take care of you there.”
2SA.19.34	“No,” he replied, “I am far too old to go with the king to Jerusalem. 
2SA.19.35	I am eighty years old today, and I can no longer enjoy anything. Food and wine are no longer tasty, and I cannot hear the singers as they sing. I would only be a burden to my lord the king. 
2SA.19.36	Just to go across the Jordan River with the king is all the honor I need! 
2SA.19.37	Then let me return again to die in my own town, where my father and mother are buried. But here is your servant, my son Kimham. Let him go with my lord the king and receive whatever you want to give him.”
2SA.19.38	“Good,” the king agreed. “Kimham will go with me, and I will help him in any way you would like. And I will do for you anything you want.” 
2SA.19.39	So all the people crossed the Jordan with the king. After David had blessed Barzillai and kissed him, Barzillai returned to his own home.
2SA.19.40	The king then crossed over to Gilgal, taking Kimham with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king on his way.
2SA.19.41	But all the men of Israel complained to the king, “The men of Judah stole the king and didn’t give us the honor of helping take you, your household, and all your men across the Jordan.”
2SA.19.42	The men of Judah replied, “The king is one of our own kinsmen. Why should this make you angry? We haven’t eaten any of the king’s food or received any special favors!”
2SA.19.43	“But there are ten tribes in Israel,” the others replied. “So we have ten times as much right to the king as you do. What right do you have to treat us with such contempt? Weren’t we the first to speak of bringing him back to be our king again?” The argument continued back and forth, and the men of Judah spoke even more harshly than the men of Israel.
2SA.20.1	There happened to be a troublemaker there named Sheba son of Bicri, a man from the tribe of Benjamin. Sheba blew a ram’s horn and began to chant: 
2SA.20.1	“Down with the dynasty of David!
2SA.20.1	We have no interest in the son of Jesse.
2SA.20.1	Come on, you men of Israel,
2SA.20.1	back to your homes!”
2SA.20.2	So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stayed with their king and escorted him from the Jordan River to Jerusalem.
2SA.20.3	When David came to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to look after the palace and placed them in seclusion. Their needs were provided for, but he no longer slept with them. So each of them lived like a widow until she died.
2SA.20.4	Then the king told Amasa, “Mobilize the army of Judah within three days, and report back at that time.” 
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went out to notify Judah, but it took him longer than the time he had been given.
2SA.20.6	Then David said to Abishai, “Sheba son of Bicri is going to hurt us more than Absalom did. Quick, take my troops and chase after him before he gets into a fortified town where we can’t reach him.”
2SA.20.7	So Abishai and Joab,
2SA.20.8	As they arrived at the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa met them. Joab was wearing his military tunic with a dagger strapped to his belt. As he stepped forward to greet Amasa, he slipped the dagger from its sheath.
2SA.20.9	“How are you, my cousin?” Joab said and took him by the beard with his right hand as though to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	Amasa didn’t notice the dagger in his left hand, and Joab stabbed him in the stomach with it so that his insides gushed out onto the ground. Joab did not need to strike again, and Amasa soon died. Joab and his brother Abishai left him lying there and continued after Sheba.
2SA.20.11	One of Joab’s young men shouted to Amasa’s troops, “If you are for Joab and David, come and follow Joab.” 
2SA.20.12	But Amasa lay in his blood in the middle of the road, and Joab’s man saw that everyone was stopping to stare at him. So he pulled him off the road into a field and threw a cloak over him. 
2SA.20.13	With Amasa’s body out of the way, everyone went on with Joab to capture Sheba son of Bicri.
2SA.20.14	Meanwhile, Sheba traveled through all the tribes of Israel and eventually came to the town of Abel-beth-maacah. All the members of his own clan, the Bicrites,
2SA.20.15	When Joab’s forces arrived, they attacked Abel-beth-maacah. They built a siege ramp against the town’s fortifications and began battering down the wall. 
2SA.20.16	But a wise woman in the town called out to Joab, “Listen to me, Joab. Come over here so I can talk to you.” 
2SA.20.17	As he approached, the woman asked, “Are you Joab?”
2SA.20.17	“I am,” he replied.
2SA.20.17	So she said, “Listen carefully to your servant.”
2SA.20.17	“I’m listening,” he said.
2SA.20.18	Then she continued, “There used to be a saying, ‘If you want to settle an argument, ask advice at the town of Abel.’ 
2SA.20.19	I am one who is peace loving and faithful in Israel. But you are destroying an important town in Israel.
2SA.20.20	And Joab replied, “Believe me, I don’t want to devour or destroy your town! 
2SA.20.21	That’s not my purpose. All I want is a man named Sheba son of Bicri from the hill country of Ephraim, who has revolted against King David. If you hand over this one man to me, I will leave the town in peace.”
2SA.20.21	“All right,” the woman replied, “we will throw his head over the wall to you.” 
2SA.20.22	Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice, and they cut off Sheba’s head and threw it out to Joab. So he blew the ram’s horn and called his troops back from the attack. They all returned to their homes, and Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem.
2SA.20.23	Now Joab was the commander of the army of Israel. Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king’s bodyguard. 
2SA.20.24	Adoniram
2SA.20.25	Sheva was the court secretary. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests. 
2SA.20.26	And Ira, a descendant of Jair, was David’s personal priest.
2SA.21.1	There was a famine during David’s reign that lasted for three years, so David asked the 
2SA.21.2	So the king summoned the Gibeonites. They were not part of Israel but were all that was left of the nation of the Amorites. The people of Israel had sworn not to kill them, but Saul, in his zeal for Israel and Judah, had tried to wipe them out. 
2SA.21.3	David asked them, “What can I do for you? How can I make amends so that you will bless the 
2SA.21.4	“Well, money can’t settle this matter between us and the family of Saul,” the Gibeonites replied. “Neither can we demand the life of anyone in Israel.”
2SA.21.4	“What can I do then?” David asked. “Just tell me and I will do it for you.”
2SA.21.5	Then they replied, “It was Saul who planned to destroy us, to keep us from having any place at all in the territory of Israel. 
2SA.21.6	So let seven of Saul’s sons be handed over to us, and we will execute them before the 
2SA.21.6	“All right,” the king said, “I will do it.” 
2SA.21.7	The king spared Jonathan’s son Mephibosheth,
2SA.21.8	But he gave them Saul’s two sons Armoni and Mephibosheth, whose mother was Rizpah daughter of Aiah. He also gave them the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab,
2SA.21.9	The men of Gibeon executed them on the mountain before the 
2SA.21.10	Then Rizpah daughter of Aiah, the mother of two of the men, spread burlap on a rock and stayed there the entire harvest season. She prevented the scavenger birds from tearing at their bodies during the day and stopped wild animals from eating them at night. 
2SA.21.11	When David learned what Rizpah, Saul’s concubine, had done, 
2SA.21.12	he went to the people of Jabesh-gilead and retrieved the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan. (When the Philistines had killed Saul and Jonathan on Mount Gilboa, the people of Jabesh-gilead stole their bodies from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hung them.) 
2SA.21.13	So David obtained the bones of Saul and Jonathan, as well as the bones of the men the Gibeonites had executed.
2SA.21.14	Then the king ordered that they bury the bones in the tomb of Kish, Saul’s father, at the town of Zela in the land of Benjamin. After that, God ended the famine in the land.
2SA.21.15	Once again the Philistines were at war with Israel. And when David and his men were in the thick of battle, David became weak and exhausted. 
2SA.21.16	Ishbi-benob was a descendant of the giants
2SA.21.17	But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David’s rescue and killed the Philistine. Then David’s men declared, “You are not going out to battle with us again! Why risk snuffing out the light of Israel?”
2SA.21.18	After this, there was another battle against the Philistines at Gob. As they fought, Sibbecai from Hushah killed Saph, another descendant of the giants.
2SA.21.19	During another battle at Gob, Elhanan son of Jair
2SA.21.20	In another battle with the Philistines at Gath, they encountered a huge man
2SA.21.21	But when he defied and taunted Israel, he was killed by Jonathan, the son of David’s brother Shimea.
2SA.21.22	These four Philistines were descendants of the giants of Gath, but David and his warriors killed them.
2SA.22.1	David sang this song to the 
2SA.22.2	He sang:
2SA.22.2	“The 
2SA.22.3	my God is my rock, in whom I find protection.
2SA.22.3	He is my shield, the power that saves me,
2SA.22.3	and my place of safety.
2SA.22.3	He is my refuge, my savior,
2SA.22.3	the one who saves me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I called on the 
2SA.22.4	and he saved me from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	“The waves of death overwhelmed me;
2SA.22.5	floods of destruction swept over me.
2SA.22.6	The grave
2SA.22.6	death laid a trap in my path.
2SA.22.7	But in my distress I cried out to the 
2SA.22.7	yes, I cried to my God for help.
2SA.22.7	He heard me from his sanctuary;
2SA.22.7	my cry reached his ears.
2SA.22.8	“Then the earth quaked and trembled.
2SA.22.8	The foundations of the heavens shook;
2SA.22.8	they quaked because of his anger.
2SA.22.9	Smoke poured from his nostrils;
2SA.22.9	fierce flames leaped from his mouth.
2SA.22.9	Glowing coals blazed forth from him.
2SA.22.10	He opened the heavens and came down;
2SA.22.10	dark storm clouds were beneath his feet.
2SA.22.11	Mounted on a mighty angelic being,
2SA.22.11	soaring
2SA.22.12	He shrouded himself in darkness,
2SA.22.12	veiling his approach with dense rain clouds.
2SA.22.13	A great brightness shone around him,
2SA.22.13	and burning coals
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.14	the voice of the Most High resounded.
2SA.22.15	He shot arrows and scattered his enemies;
2SA.22.15	his lightning flashed, and they were confused.
2SA.22.16	Then at the command of the 
2SA.22.16	at the blast of his breath,
2SA.22.16	the bottom of the sea could be seen,
2SA.22.16	and the foundations of the earth were laid bare.
2SA.22.17	“He reached down from heaven and rescued me;
2SA.22.17	he drew me out of deep waters.
2SA.22.18	He rescued me from my powerful enemies,
2SA.22.18	from those who hated me and were too strong for me.
2SA.22.19	They attacked me at a moment when I was in distress,
2SA.22.19	but the 
2SA.22.20	He led me to a place of safety;
2SA.22.20	he rescued me because he delights in me.
2SA.22.21	The 
2SA.22.21	he restored me because of my innocence.
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the 
2SA.22.22	I have not turned from my God to follow evil.
2SA.22.23	I have followed all his regulations;
2SA.22.23	I have never abandoned his decrees.
2SA.22.24	I am blameless before God;
2SA.22.24	I have kept myself from sin.
2SA.22.25	The 
2SA.22.25	He has seen my innocence.
2SA.22.26	“To the faithful you show yourself faithful;
2SA.22.26	to those with integrity you show integrity.
2SA.22.27	To the pure you show yourself pure,
2SA.22.27	but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.
2SA.22.28	You rescue the humble,
2SA.22.28	but your eyes watch the proud and humiliate them.
2SA.22.29	O 
2SA.22.29	The 
2SA.22.30	In your strength I can crush an army;
2SA.22.30	with my God I can scale any wall.
2SA.22.31	“God’s way is perfect.

2SA.22.31	He is a shield for all who look to him for protection.
2SA.22.32	For who is God except the 
2SA.22.32	Who but our God is a solid rock?
2SA.22.33	God is my strong fortress,
2SA.22.33	and he makes my way perfect.
2SA.22.34	He makes me as surefooted as a deer,
2SA.22.34	enabling me to stand on mountain heights.
2SA.22.35	He trains my hands for battle;
2SA.22.35	he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze bow.
2SA.22.36	You have given me your shield of victory;
2SA.22.36	your help
2SA.22.37	You have made a wide path for my feet
2SA.22.37	to keep them from slipping.
2SA.22.38	“I chased my enemies and destroyed them;
2SA.22.38	I did not stop until they were conquered.
2SA.22.39	I consumed them;
2SA.22.39	I struck them down so they did not get up;
2SA.22.39	they fell beneath my feet.
2SA.22.40	You have armed me with strength for the battle;
2SA.22.40	you have subdued my enemies under my feet.
2SA.22.41	You placed my foot on their necks.
2SA.22.41	I have destroyed all who hated me.
2SA.22.42	They looked for help, but no one came to their rescue.
2SA.22.42	They even cried to the 
2SA.22.43	I ground them as fine as the dust of the earth;
2SA.22.43	I trampled them
2SA.22.44	“You gave me victory over my accusers.
2SA.22.44	You preserved me as the ruler over nations;
2SA.22.44	people I don’t even know now serve me.
2SA.22.45	Foreign nations cringe before me;
2SA.22.45	as soon as they hear of me, they submit.
2SA.22.46	They all lose their courage
2SA.22.46	and come trembling
2SA.22.47	“The 
2SA.22.47	May God, the Rock of my salvation, be exalted!
2SA.22.48	He is the God who pays back those who harm me;
2SA.22.48	he brings down the nations under me
2SA.22.49	and delivers me from my enemies.
2SA.22.49	You hold me safe beyond the reach of my enemies;
2SA.22.49	you save me from violent opponents.
2SA.22.50	For this, O 
2SA.22.50	I will sing praises to your name.
2SA.22.51	You give great victories to your king;
2SA.22.51	you show unfailing love to your anointed,
2SA.22.51	to David and all his descendants forever.”
2SA.23.1	These are the last words of David:
2SA.23.1	“David, the son of Jesse, speaks—
2SA.23.1	David, the man who was raised up so high,
2SA.23.1	David, the man anointed by the God of Jacob,
2SA.23.1	David, the sweet psalmist of Israel.
2SA.23.2	“The Spirit of the 
2SA.23.2	his words are upon my tongue.
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel spoke.
2SA.23.3	The Rock of Israel said to me:
2SA.23.3	‘The one who rules righteously,
2SA.23.3	who rules in the fear of God,
2SA.23.4	is like the light of morning at sunrise,
2SA.23.4	like a morning without clouds,
2SA.23.4	like the gleaming of the sun
2SA.23.4	on new grass after rain.’
2SA.23.5	“Is it not my family God has chosen?
2SA.23.5	Yes, he has made an everlasting covenant with me.
2SA.23.5	His agreement is arranged and guaranteed in every detail.
2SA.23.5	He will ensure my safety and success.
2SA.23.6	But the godless are like thorns to be thrown away,
2SA.23.6	for they tear the hand that touches them.
2SA.23.7	One must use iron tools to chop them down;
2SA.23.7	they will be totally consumed by fire.”
2SA.23.8	These are the names of David’s mightiest warriors. The first was Jashobeam the Hacmonite,
2SA.23.9	Next in rank among the Three was Eleazar son of Dodai, a descendant of Ahoah. Once Eleazar and David stood together against the Philistines when the entire Israelite army had fled. 
2SA.23.10	He killed Philistines until his hand was too tired to lift his sword, and the 
2SA.23.11	Next in rank was Shammah son of Agee from Harar. One time the Philistines gathered at Lehi and attacked the Israelites in a field full of lentils. The Israelite army fled, 
2SA.23.12	but Shammah
2SA.23.13	Once during the harvest, when David was at the cave of Adullam, the Philistine army was camped in the valley of Rephaim. The Three (who were among the Thirty—an elite group among David’s fighting men) went down to meet him there. 
2SA.23.14	David was staying in the stronghold at the time, and a Philistine detachment had occupied the town of Bethlehem.
2SA.23.15	David remarked longingly to his men, “Oh, how I would love some of that good water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem.” 
2SA.23.16	So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew some water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to the 
2SA.23.17	“The 
2SA.23.18	Abishai son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, was the leader of the Thirty.
2SA.23.19	Abishai was the most famous of the Thirty
2SA.23.20	There was also Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant warrior
2SA.23.21	Once, armed only with a club, he killed an imposing Egyptian warrior who was armed with a spear. Benaiah wrenched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with it. 
2SA.23.22	Deeds like these made Benaiah as famous as the Three mightiest warriors. 
2SA.23.23	He was more honored than the other members of the Thirty, though he was not one of the Three. And David made him captain of his bodyguard.
2SA.23.24	Other members of the Thirty included:
2SA.23.24	Asahel, Joab’s brother;
2SA.23.24	Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem;
2SA.23.25	Shammah from Harod;
2SA.23.25	Elika from Harod;
2SA.23.26	Helez from Pelon
2SA.23.26	Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa;
2SA.23.27	Abiezer from Anathoth;
2SA.23.27	Sibbecai
2SA.23.28	Zalmon from Ahoah;
2SA.23.28	Maharai from Netophah;

2SA.23.29	Ithai
2SA.23.30	Benaiah from Pirathon;
2SA.23.30	Hurai
2SA.23.31	Abi-albon from Arabah;
2SA.23.31	Azmaveth from Bahurim;
2SA.23.32	Eliahba from Shaalbon;
2SA.23.32	the sons of Jashen;
2SA.23.32	Jonathan 
2SA.23.33	son of Shagee
2SA.23.33	Ahiam son of Sharar from Harar;
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet son of Ahasbai from Maacah;
2SA.23.34	Eliam son of Ahithophel from Giloh;
2SA.23.35	Hezro from Carmel;
2SA.23.35	Paarai from Arba;
2SA.23.36	Igal son of Nathan from Zobah;
2SA.23.36	Bani from Gad;
2SA.23.37	Zelek from Ammon;
2SA.23.37	Naharai from Beeroth, the armor bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah;
2SA.23.38	Ira from Jattir;
2SA.23.38	Gareb from Jattir;
2SA.23.39	Uriah the Hittite.
2SA.23.39	There were thirty-seven in all.
2SA.24.1	Once again the anger of the 
2SA.24.2	So the king said to Joab and the commanders
2SA.24.3	But Joab replied to the king, “May the 
2SA.24.4	But the king insisted that they take the census, so Joab and the commanders of the army went out to count the people of Israel. 
2SA.24.5	First they crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer, south of the town in the valley, in the direction of Gad. Then they went on to Jazer, 
2SA.24.6	then to Gilead in the land of Tahtim-hodshi
2SA.24.7	Then they came to the fortress of Tyre, and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went south to Judah
2SA.24.8	Having gone through the entire land for nine months and twenty days, they returned to Jerusalem. 
2SA.24.9	Joab reported the number of people to the king. There were 800,000 capable warriors in Israel who could handle a sword, and 500,000 in Judah.
2SA.24.10	But after he had taken the census, David’s conscience began to bother him. And he said to the 
2SA.24.11	The next morning the word of the 
2SA.24.12	“Go and say to David, ‘This is what the 
2SA.24.13	So Gad came to David and asked him, “Will you choose three

2SA.24.15	So the 
2SA.24.16	But as the angel was preparing to destroy Jerusalem, the 
2SA.24.17	When David saw the angel, he said to the 
2SA.24.18	That day Gad came to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar to the 
2SA.24.19	So David went up to do what the 
2SA.24.20	When Araunah saw the king and his men coming toward him, he came and bowed before the king with his face to the ground. 
2SA.24.21	“Why have you come, my lord the king?” Araunah asked.
2SA.24.21	David replied, “I have come to buy your threshing floor and to build an altar to the 
2SA.24.22	“Take it, my lord the king, and use it as you wish,” Araunah said to David. “Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and you can use the threshing boards and ox yokes for wood to build a fire on the altar. 
2SA.24.23	I will give it all to you, Your Majesty, and may the 
2SA.24.24	But the king replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on buying it, for I will not present burnt offerings to the 
2SA.24.25	David built an altar there to the 
1KI.1.1	King David was now very old, and no matter how many blankets covered him, he could not keep warm. 
1KI.1.2	So his advisers told him, “Let us find a young virgin to wait on you and look after you, my lord. She will lie in your arms and keep you warm.”
1KI.1.3	So they searched throughout the land of Israel for a beautiful girl, and they found Abishag from Shunem and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	The girl was very beautiful, and she looked after the king and took care of him. But the king had no sexual relations with her.
1KI.1.5	About that time David’s son Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, began boasting, “I will make myself king.” So he provided himself with chariots and charioteers and recruited fifty men to run in front of him. 
1KI.1.6	Now his father, King David, had never disciplined him at any time, even by asking, “Why are you doing that?” Adonijah had been born next after Absalom, and he was very handsome.
1KI.1.7	Adonijah took Joab son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest into his confidence, and they agreed to help him become king. 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David’s personal bodyguard refused to support Adonijah.
1KI.1.9	Adonijah went to the Stone of Zoheleth
1KI.1.10	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the king’s bodyguard or his brother Solomon.
1KI.1.11	Then Nathan went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, and asked her, “Haven’t you heard that Haggith’s son, Adonijah, has made himself king, and our lord David doesn’t even know about it? 
1KI.1.12	If you want to save your own life and the life of your son Solomon, follow my advice. 
1KI.1.13	Go at once to King David and say to him, ‘My lord the king, didn’t you make a vow and say to me, “Your son Solomon will surely be the next king and will sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’ 
1KI.1.14	And while you are still talking with him, I will come and confirm everything you have said.”
1KI.1.15	So Bathsheba went into the king’s bedroom. (He was very old now, and Abishag was taking care of him.) 
1KI.1.16	Bathsheba bowed down before the king.
1KI.1.16	“What can I do for you?” he asked her.
1KI.1.17	She replied, “My lord, you made a vow before the 
1KI.1.18	But instead, Adonijah has made himself king, and my lord the king does not even know about it. 
1KI.1.19	He has sacrificed many cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and he has invited all the king’s sons to attend the celebration. He also invited Abiathar the priest and Joab, the commander of the army. But he did not invite your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.20	And now, my lord the king, all Israel is waiting for you to announce who will become king after you. 
1KI.1.21	If you do not act, my son Solomon and I will be treated as criminals as soon as my lord the king has died.”
1KI.1.22	While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. 
1KI.1.23	The king’s officials told him, “Nathan the prophet is here to see you.”
1KI.1.23	Nathan went in and bowed before the king with his face to the ground. 
1KI.1.24	Nathan asked, “My lord the king, have you decided that Adonijah will be the next king and that he will sit on your throne? 
1KI.1.25	Today he has sacrificed many cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and he has invited all the king’s sons to attend the celebration. He also invited the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. They are feasting and drinking with him and shouting, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ 
1KI.1.26	But he did not invite me or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.27	Has my lord the king really done this without letting any of his officials know who should be the next king?”
1KI.1.28	King David responded, “Call Bathsheba!” So she came back in and stood before the king. 
1KI.1.29	And the king repeated his vow: “As surely as the 
1KI.1.30	your son Solomon will be the next king and will sit on my throne this very day, just as I vowed to you before the 
1KI.1.31	Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground before the king and exclaimed, “May my lord King David live forever!”
1KI.1.32	Then King David ordered, “Call Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” When they came into the king’s presence, 
1KI.1.33	the king said to them, “Take Solomon and my officials down to Gihon Spring. Solomon is to ride on my own mule. 
1KI.1.34	There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him king over Israel. Blow the ram’s horn and shout, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 
1KI.1.35	Then escort him back here, and he will sit on my throne. He will succeed me as king, for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”
1KI.1.36	“Amen!” Benaiah son of Jehoiada replied. “May the 
1KI.1.37	And may the 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the king’s bodyguard
1KI.1.39	There Zadok the priest took the flask of olive oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon with the oil. Then they sounded the ram’s horn and all the people shouted, “Long live King Solomon!” 
1KI.1.40	And all the people followed Solomon into Jerusalem, playing flutes and shouting for joy. The celebration was so joyous and noisy that the earth shook with the sound.
1KI.1.41	Adonijah and his guests heard the celebrating and shouting just as they were finishing their banquet. When Joab heard the sound of the ram’s horn, he asked, “What’s going on? Why is the city in such an uproar?”
1KI.1.42	And while he was still speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. “Come in,” Adonijah said to him, “for you are a good man. You must have good news.”
1KI.1.43	“Not at all!” Jonathan replied. “Our lord King David has just declared Solomon king! 
1KI.1.44	The king sent him down to Gihon Spring with Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, protected by the king’s bodyguard. They had him ride on the king’s own mule, 
1KI.1.45	and Zadok and Nathan have anointed him at Gihon Spring as the new king. They have just returned, and the whole city is celebrating and rejoicing. That’s what all the noise is about. 
1KI.1.46	What’s more, Solomon is now sitting on the royal throne as king. 
1KI.1.47	And all the royal officials have gone to King David and congratulated him, saying, ‘May your God make Solomon’s fame even greater than your own, and may Solomon’s reign be even greater than yours!’ Then the king bowed his head in worship as he lay in his bed, 
1KI.1.48	and he said, ‘Praise the 
1KI.1.49	Then all of Adonijah’s guests jumped up in panic from the banquet table and quickly scattered. 
1KI.1.50	Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, so he rushed to the sacred tent and grabbed on to the horns of the altar. 
1KI.1.51	Word soon reached Solomon that Adonijah had seized the horns of the altar in fear, and that he was pleading, “Let King Solomon swear today that he will not kill me!”
1KI.1.52	Solomon replied, “If he proves himself to be loyal, not a hair on his head will be touched. But if he makes trouble, he will die.” 
1KI.1.53	So King Solomon summoned Adonijah, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed respectfully before King Solomon, who dismissed him, saying, “Go on home.”
1KI.2.1	As the time of King David’s death approached, he gave this charge to his son Solomon:
1KI.2.2	“I am going where everyone on earth must someday go. Take courage and be a man. 
1KI.2.3	Observe the requirements of the 
1KI.2.4	If you do this, then the 
1KI.2.5	“And there is something else. You know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me when he murdered my two army commanders, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He pretended that it was an act of war, but it was done in a time of peace,
1KI.2.6	Do with him what you think best, but don’t let him grow old and go to his grave in peace.
1KI.2.7	“Be kind to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead. Make them permanent guests at your table, for they took care of me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
1KI.2.8	“And remember Shimei son of Gera, the man from Bahurim in Benjamin. He cursed me with a terrible curse as I was fleeing to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan River, I swore by the 
1KI.2.9	But that oath does not make him innocent. You are a wise man, and you will know how to arrange a bloody death for him.
1KI.2.10	Then David died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. 
1KI.2.11	David had reigned over Israel for forty years, seven of them in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. 
1KI.2.12	Solomon became king and sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.
1KI.2.13	One day Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, came to see Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. “Have you come with peaceful intentions?” she asked him.
1KI.2.13	“Yes,” he said, “I come in peace. 
1KI.2.14	In fact, I have a favor to ask of you.”
1KI.2.14	“What is it?” she asked.
1KI.2.15	He replied, “As you know, the kingdom was rightfully mine; all Israel wanted me to be the next king. But the tables were turned, and the kingdom went to my brother instead; for that is the way the 
1KI.2.16	So now I have just one favor to ask of you. Please don’t turn me down.”
1KI.2.16	“What is it?” she asked.
1KI.2.17	He replied, “Speak to King Solomon on my behalf, for I know he will do anything you request. Ask him to let me marry Abishag, the girl from Shunem.”
1KI.2.18	“All right,” Bathsheba replied. “I will speak to the king for you.”
1KI.2.19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak on Adonijah’s behalf. The king rose from his throne to meet her, and he bowed down before her. When he sat down on his throne again, the king ordered that a throne be brought for his mother, and she sat at his right hand.
1KI.2.20	“I have one small request to make of you,” she said. “I hope you won’t turn me down.”
1KI.2.20	“What is it, my mother?” he asked. “You know I won’t refuse you.”
1KI.2.21	“Then let your brother Adonijah marry Abishag, the girl from Shunem,” she replied.
1KI.2.22	“How can you possibly ask me to give Abishag to Adonijah?” King Solomon demanded. “You might as well ask me to give him the kingdom! You know that he is my older brother, and that he has Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah on his side.”
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon made a vow before the 
1KI.2.24	The 
1KI.2.25	So King Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada to execute him, and Adonijah was put to death.
1KI.2.26	Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, “Go back to your home in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not kill you now, because you carried the Ark of the Sovereign 
1KI.2.27	So Solomon deposed Abiathar from his position as priest of the 
1KI.2.28	Joab had not joined Absalom’s earlier rebellion, but he had joined Adonijah’s rebellion. So when Joab heard about Adonijah’s death, he ran to the sacred tent of the 
1KI.2.29	When this was reported to King Solomon, he sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada to execute him.
1KI.2.30	Benaiah went to the sacred tent of the 
1KI.2.30	But Joab answered, “No, I will die here.”
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah returned to the king and told him what Joab had said.
1KI.2.31	“Do as he said,” the king replied. “Kill him there beside the altar and bury him. This will remove the guilt of Joab’s senseless murders from me and from my father’s family. 
1KI.2.32	The 
1KI.2.33	May their blood be on Joab and his descendants forever, and may the 
1KI.2.34	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada returned to the sacred tent and killed Joab, and he was buried at his home in the wilderness. 
1KI.2.35	Then the king appointed Benaiah to command the army in place of Joab, and he installed Zadok the priest to take the place of Abiathar.
1KI.2.36	The king then sent for Shimei and told him, “Build a house here in Jerusalem and live there. But don’t step outside the city to go anywhere else. 
1KI.2.37	On the day you so much as cross the Kidron Valley, you will surely die; and your blood will be on your own head.”
1KI.2.38	Shimei replied, “Your sentence is fair; I will do whatever my lord the king commands.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
1KI.2.39	But three years later two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to King Achish son of Maacah of Gath. When Shimei learned where they were, 
1KI.2.40	he saddled his donkey and went to Gath to search for them. When he found them, he brought them back to Jerusalem.
1KI.2.41	Solomon heard that Shimei had left Jerusalem and had gone to Gath and returned. 
1KI.2.42	So the king sent for Shimei and demanded, “Didn’t I make you swear by the 
1KI.2.43	Then why haven’t you kept your oath to the 
1KI.2.44	The king also said to Shimei, “You certainly remember all the wicked things you did to my father, David. May the 
1KI.2.45	But may I, King Solomon, receive the 
1KI.2.46	Then, at the king’s command, Benaiah son of Jehoiada took Shimei outside and killed him.
1KI.2.46	So the kingdom was now firmly in Solomon’s grip.
1KI.3.1	Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and married one of his daughters. He brought her to live in the City of David until he could finish building his palace and the Temple of the 
1KI.3.2	At that time the people of Israel sacrificed their offerings at local places of worship, for a temple honoring the name of the 
1KI.3.3	Solomon loved the 
1KI.3.4	The most important of these places of worship was at Gibeon, so the king went there and sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings. 
1KI.3.5	That night the 
1KI.3.6	Solomon replied, “You showed great and faithful love to your servant my father, David, because he was honest and true and faithful to you. And you have continued to show this great and faithful love to him today by giving him a son to sit on his throne.
1KI.3.7	“Now, O 
1KI.3.8	And here I am in the midst of your own chosen people, a nation so great and numerous they cannot be counted! 
1KI.3.9	Give me an understanding heart so that I can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong. For who by himself is able to govern this great people of yours?”
1KI.3.10	The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for wisdom. 
1KI.3.11	So God replied, “Because you have asked for wisdom in governing my people with justice and have not asked for a long life or wealth or the death of your enemies—
1KI.3.12	I will give you what you asked for! I will give you a wise and understanding heart such as no one else has had or ever will have! 
1KI.3.13	And I will also give you what you did not ask for—riches and fame! No other king in all the world will be compared to you for the rest of your life! 
1KI.3.14	And if you follow me and obey my decrees and my commands as your father, David, did, I will give you a long life.”
1KI.3.15	Then Solomon woke up and realized it had been a dream. He returned to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, where he sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then he invited all his officials to a great banquet.
1KI.3.16	Some time later two prostitutes came to the king to have an argument settled. 
1KI.3.17	“Please, my lord,” one of them began, “this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth to a baby while she was with me in the house. 
1KI.3.18	Three days later this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there were only two of us in the house.
1KI.3.19	“But her baby died during the night when she rolled over on it. 
1KI.3.20	Then she got up in the night and took my son from beside me while I was asleep. She laid her dead child in my arms and took mine to sleep beside her. 
1KI.3.21	And in the morning when I tried to nurse my son, he was dead! But when I looked more closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn’t my son at all.”
1KI.3.22	Then the other woman interrupted, “It certainly was your son, and the living child is mine.”
1KI.3.22	“No,” the first woman said, “the living child is mine, and the dead one is yours.” And so they argued back and forth before the king.
1KI.3.23	Then the king said, “Let’s get the facts straight. Both of you claim the living child is yours, and each says that the dead one belongs to the other. 
1KI.3.24	All right, bring me a sword.” So a sword was brought to the king.
1KI.3.25	Then he said, “Cut the living child in two, and give half to one woman and half to the other!”
1KI.3.26	Then the woman who was the real mother of the living child, and who loved him very much, cried out, “Oh no, my lord! Give her the child—please do not kill him!”
1KI.3.26	But the other woman said, “All right, he will be neither yours nor mine; divide him between us!”
1KI.3.27	Then the king said, “Do not kill the child, but give him to the woman who wants him to live, for she is his mother!”
1KI.3.28	When all Israel heard the king’s decision, the people were in awe of the king, for they saw the wisdom God had given him for rendering justice.
1KI.4.1	King Solomon now ruled over all Israel, 
1KI.4.2	and these were his high officials:
1KI.4.2	Azariah son of Zadok was the priest.
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, were court secretaries.
1KI.4.3	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the royal historian.
1KI.4.4	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was commander of the army.
1KI.4.4	Zadok and Abiathar were priests.
1KI.4.5	Azariah son of Nathan was in charge of the district governors.
1KI.4.5	Zabud son of Nathan, a priest, was a trusted adviser to the king.
1KI.4.6	Ahishar was manager of the palace property.
1KI.4.6	Adoniram son of Abda was in charge of forced labor.
1KI.4.7	Solomon also had twelve district governors who were over all Israel. They were responsible for providing food for the king’s household. Each of them arranged provisions for one month of the year. 
1KI.4.8	These are the names of the twelve governors:
1KI.4.8	Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim.
1KI.4.9	Ben-deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-bethhanan.
1KI.4.10	Ben-hesed, in Arubboth, including Socoh and all the land of Hepher.
1KI.4.11	Ben-abinadab, in all of Naphoth-dor.
1KI.4.12	Baana son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, all of Beth-shan
1KI.4.13	Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead, including the Towns of Jair (named for Jair of the tribe of Manasseh
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab son of Iddo, in Mahanaim.
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz, in Naphtali. (He was married to Basemath, another of Solomon’s daughters.)
1KI.4.16	Baana son of Hushai, in Asher and in Aloth.
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat son of Paruah, in Issachar.
1KI.4.18	Shimei son of Ela, in Benjamin.
1KI.4.19	Geber son of Uri, in the land of Gilead,
1KI.4.19	There was also one governor over the land of Judah.
1KI.4.20	The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They were very contented, with plenty to eat and drink. 
1KI.4.21	Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River
1KI.4.22	The daily food requirements for Solomon’s palace were 150 bushels of choice flour and 300 bushels of meal
1KI.4.23	also 10 oxen from the fattening pens, 20 pasture-fed cattle, 100 sheep or goats, as well as deer, gazelles, roe deer, and choice poultry.
1KI.4.24	Solomon’s dominion extended over all the kingdoms west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah to Gaza. And there was peace on all his borders. 
1KI.4.25	During the lifetime of Solomon, all of Judah and Israel lived in peace and safety. And from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, each family had its own home and garden.
1KI.4.26	Solomon had 4,000
1KI.4.27	The district governors faithfully provided food for King Solomon and his court; each made sure nothing was lacking during the month assigned to him. 
1KI.4.28	They also brought the necessary barley and straw for the royal horses in the stables.
1KI.4.29	God gave Solomon very great wisdom and understanding, and knowledge as vast as the sands of the seashore. 
1KI.4.30	In fact, his wisdom exceeded that of all the wise men of the East and the wise men of Egypt. 
1KI.4.31	He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite and the sons of Mahol—Heman, Calcol, and Darda. His fame spread throughout all the surrounding nations. 
1KI.4.32	He composed some 3,000 proverbs and wrote 1,005 songs. 
1KI.4.33	He could speak with authority about all kinds of plants, from the great cedar of Lebanon to the tiny hyssop that grows from cracks in a wall. He could also speak about animals, birds, small creatures, and fish. 
1KI.4.34	And kings from every nation sent their ambassadors to listen to the wisdom of Solomon.
1KI.5.1	King Hiram of Tyre had always been a loyal friend of David. When Hiram learned that David’s son Solomon was the new king of Israel, he sent ambassadors to congratulate him.
1KI.5.2	Then Solomon sent this message back to Hiram:
1KI.5.3	“You know that my father, David, was not able to build a Temple to honor the name of the 
1KI.5.4	But now the 
1KI.5.5	So I am planning to build a Temple to honor the name of the 
1KI.5.6	“Therefore, please command that cedars from Lebanon be cut for me. Let my men work alongside yours, and I will pay your men whatever wages you ask. As you know, there is no one among us who can cut timber like you Sidonians!”
1KI.5.7	When Hiram received Solomon’s message, he was very pleased and said, “Praise the 
1KI.5.8	Then he sent this reply to Solomon:
1KI.5.8	“I have received your message, and I will supply all the cedar and cypress timber you need. 
1KI.5.9	My servants will bring the logs from the Lebanon mountains to the Mediterranean Sea
1KI.5.10	So Hiram supplied as much cedar and cypress timber as Solomon desired. 
1KI.5.11	In return, Solomon sent him an annual payment of 100,000 bushels
1KI.5.12	So the 
1KI.5.13	Then King Solomon conscripted a labor force of 30,000 men from all Israel. 
1KI.5.14	He sent them to Lebanon in shifts, 10,000 every month, so that each man would be one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of this labor force. 
1KI.5.15	Solomon also had 70,000 common laborers, 80,000 quarry workers in the hill country, 
1KI.5.16	and 3,600
1KI.5.17	At the king’s command, they quarried large blocks of high-quality stone and shaped them to make the foundation of the Temple. 
1KI.5.18	Men from the city of Gebal helped Solomon’s and Hiram’s builders prepare the timber and stone for the Temple.
1KI.6.1	It was in midspring, in the month of Ziv,
1KI.6.2	The Temple that King Solomon built for the 
1KI.6.3	The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet
1KI.6.4	Solomon also made narrow recessed windows throughout the Temple.
1KI.6.5	He built a complex of rooms against the outer walls of the Temple, all the way around the sides and rear of the building. 
1KI.6.6	The complex was three stories high, the bottom floor being 7
1KI.6.7	The stones used in the construction of the Temple were finished at the quarry, so there was no sound of hammer, ax, or any other iron tool at the building site.
1KI.6.8	The entrance to the bottom floor
1KI.6.9	After completing the Temple structure, Solomon put in a ceiling made of cedar beams and planks. 
1KI.6.10	As already stated, he built a complex of rooms along the sides of the building, attached to the Temple walls by cedar timbers. Each story of the complex was 7
1KI.6.11	Then the 
1KI.6.12	“Concerning this Temple you are building, if you keep all my decrees and regulations and obey all my commands, I will fulfill through you the promise I made to your father, David. 
1KI.6.13	I will live among the Israelites and will never abandon my people Israel.”
1KI.6.14	So Solomon finished building the Temple. 
1KI.6.15	The entire inside, from floor to ceiling, was paneled with wood. He paneled the walls and ceilings with cedar, and he used planks of cypress for the floors. 
1KI.6.16	He partitioned off an inner sanctuary—the Most Holy Place—at the far end of the Temple. It was 30 feet deep and was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling. 
1KI.6.17	The main room of the Temple, outside the Most Holy Place, was 60 feet
1KI.6.18	Cedar paneling completely covered the stone walls throughout the Temple, and the paneling was decorated with carvings of gourds and open flowers.
1KI.6.19	He prepared the inner sanctuary at the far end of the Temple, where the Ark of the 
1KI.6.20	This inner sanctuary was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high. He overlaid the inside with solid gold. He also overlaid the altar made of cedar.
1KI.6.21	Then Solomon overlaid the rest of the Temple’s interior with solid gold, and he made gold chains to protect the entrance
1KI.6.22	So he finished overlaying the entire Temple with gold, including the altar that belonged to the Most Holy Place.
1KI.6.23	He made two cherubim of wild olive
1KI.6.24	The wingspan of each of the cherubim was 15 feet, each wing being 7
1KI.6.25	The two cherubim were identical in shape and size; 
1KI.6.26	each was 15 feet tall. 
1KI.6.27	He placed them side by side in the inner sanctuary of the Temple. Their outspread wings reached from wall to wall, while their inner wings touched at the center of the room. 
1KI.6.28	He overlaid the two cherubim with gold.
1KI.6.29	He decorated all the walls of the inner sanctuary and the main room with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. 
1KI.6.30	He overlaid the floor in both rooms with gold.
1KI.6.31	For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, he made double doors of wild olive wood with five-sided doorposts.
1KI.6.32	These double doors were decorated with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. The doors, including the decorations of cherubim and palm trees, were overlaid with gold.
1KI.6.33	Then he made four-sided doorposts of wild olive wood for the entrance to the Temple. 
1KI.6.34	There were two folding doors of cypress wood, and each door was hinged to fold back upon itself. 
1KI.6.35	These doors were decorated with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers—all overlaid evenly with gold.
1KI.6.36	The walls of the inner courtyard were built so that there was one layer of cedar beams between every three layers of finished stone.
1KI.6.37	The foundation of the 
1KI.6.38	The entire building was completed in every detail by midautumn, in the month of Bul,
1KI.7.1	Solomon also built a palace for himself, and it took him thirteen years to complete the construction.
1KI.7.2	One of Solomon’s buildings was called the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. It was 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
1KI.7.3	The hall had a cedar roof. Above the beams on the pillars were forty-five side rooms,
1KI.7.4	On each end of the long hall were three rows of windows facing each other. 
1KI.7.5	All the doorways and doorposts
1KI.7.6	Solomon also built the Hall of Pillars, which was 75 feet long and 45 feet wide.
1KI.7.7	Solomon also built the throne room, known as the Hall of Justice, where he sat to hear legal matters. It was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling.
1KI.7.8	Solomon’s living quarters surrounded a courtyard behind this hall, and they were constructed the same way. He also built similar living quarters for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.
1KI.7.9	From foundation to eaves, all these buildings were built from huge blocks of high-quality stone, cut with saws and trimmed to exact measure on all sides. 
1KI.7.10	Some of the huge foundation stones were 15 feet long, and some were 12 feet
1KI.7.11	The blocks of high-quality stone used in the walls were also cut to measure, and cedar beams were also used. 
1KI.7.12	The walls of the great courtyard were built so that there was one layer of cedar beams between every three layers of finished stone, just like the walls of the inner courtyard of the 
1KI.7.13	King Solomon then asked for a man named Huram
1KI.7.14	He was half Israelite, since his mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father had been a craftsman in bronze from Tyre. Huram was extremely skillful and talented in any work in bronze, and he came to do all the metal work for King Solomon.
1KI.7.15	Huram cast two bronze pillars, each 27 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference.
1KI.7.16	For the tops of the pillars he cast bronze capitals, each 7
1KI.7.17	Each capital was decorated with seven sets of latticework and interwoven chains. 
1KI.7.18	He also encircled the latticework with two rows of pomegranates to decorate the capitals over the pillars. 
1KI.7.19	The capitals on the columns inside the entry room were shaped like water lilies, and they were six feet
1KI.7.20	The capitals on the two pillars had 200 pomegranates in two rows around them, beside the rounded surface next to the latticework. 
1KI.7.21	Huram set the pillars at the entrance of the Temple, one toward the south and one toward the north. He named the one on the south Jakin, and the one on the north Boaz.
1KI.7.22	The capitals on the pillars were shaped like water lilies. And so the work on the pillars was finished.
1KI.7.23	Then Huram cast a great round basin, 15 feet across from rim to rim, called the Sea. It was 7
1KI.7.24	It was encircled just below its rim by two rows of decorative gourds. There were about six gourds per foot
1KI.7.25	The Sea was placed on a base of twelve bronze oxen,
1KI.7.26	The walls of the Sea were about three inches
1KI.7.27	Huram also made ten bronze water carts, each 6 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 4
1KI.7.28	They were constructed with side panels braced with crossbars. 
1KI.7.29	Both the panels and the crossbars were decorated with carved lions, oxen, and cherubim. Above and below the lions and oxen were wreath decorations. 
1KI.7.30	Each of these carts had four bronze wheels and bronze axles. There were supporting posts for the bronze basins at the corners of the carts; these supports were decorated on each side with carvings of wreaths. 
1KI.7.31	The top of each cart had a rounded frame for the basin. It projected 1
1KI.7.32	Under the panels were four wheels that were connected to axles that had been cast as one unit with the cart. The wheels were 2
1KI.7.33	and were similar to chariot wheels. The axles, spokes, rims, and hubs were all cast from molten bronze.
1KI.7.34	There were handles at each of the four corners of the carts, and these, too, were cast as one unit with the cart. 
1KI.7.35	Around the top of each cart was a rim nine inches wide.
1KI.7.36	Carvings of cherubim, lions, and palm trees decorated the panels and corner supports wherever there was room, and there were wreaths all around. 
1KI.7.37	All ten water carts were the same size and were made alike, for each was cast from the same mold.
1KI.7.38	Huram also made ten smaller bronze basins, one for each cart. Each basin was six feet across and could hold 220 gallons
1KI.7.39	He set five water carts on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. The great bronze basin called the Sea was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple. 
1KI.7.40	He also made the necessary washbasins, shovels, and bowls.
1KI.7.40	So at last Huram completed everything King Solomon had assigned him to make for the Temple of the 
1KI.7.41	the two pillars;
1KI.7.41	the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
1KI.7.41	the two networks of interwoven chains that decorated the capitals;
1KI.7.42	the 400 pomegranates that hung from the chains on the capitals (two rows of pomegranates for each of the chain networks that decorated the capitals on top of the pillars);
1KI.7.43	the ten water carts holding the ten basins;
1KI.7.44	the Sea and the twelve oxen under it;
1KI.7.45	the ash buckets, the shovels, and the bowls.
1KI.7.45	Huram made all these things of burnished bronze for the Temple of the 
1KI.7.46	The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan. 
1KI.7.47	Solomon did not weigh all these things because there were so many; the weight of the bronze could not be measured.
1KI.7.48	Solomon also made all the furnishings of the Temple of the 
1KI.7.48	the gold altar;
1KI.7.48	the gold table for the Bread of the Presence;
1KI.7.49	the lampstands of solid gold, five on the south and five on the north, in front of the Most Holy Place;
1KI.7.49	the flower decorations, lamps, and tongs—all of gold;
1KI.7.50	the small bowls, lamp snuffers, bowls, ladles, and incense burners—all of solid gold;
1KI.7.50	the doors for the entrances to the Most Holy Place and the main room of the Temple, with their fronts overlaid with gold.
1KI.7.51	So King Solomon finished all his work on the Temple of the 
1KI.8.1	Solomon then summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes—the leaders of the ancestral families of the Israelites. They were to bring the Ark of the 
1KI.8.2	So all the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon at the annual Festival of Shelters, which is held in early autumn in the month of Ethanim.
1KI.8.3	When all the elders of Israel arrived, the priests picked up the Ark. 
1KI.8.4	The priests and Levites brought up the Ark of the 
1KI.8.5	There, before the Ark, King Solomon and the entire community of Israel sacrificed so many sheep, goats, and cattle that no one could keep count!
1KI.8.6	Then the priests carried the Ark of the 
1KI.8.7	The cherubim spread their wings over the Ark, forming a canopy over the Ark and its carrying poles. 
1KI.8.8	These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place, which is in front of the Most Holy Place, but not from the outside. They are still there to this day. 
1KI.8.9	Nothing was in the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Mount Sinai,
1KI.8.10	When the priests came out of the Holy Place, a thick cloud filled the Temple of the 
1KI.8.11	The priests could not continue their service because of the cloud, for the glorious presence of the 
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon prayed, “O 
1KI.8.13	Now I have built a glorious Temple for you, a place where you can live forever!
1KI.8.14	Then the king turned around to the entire community of Israel standing before him and gave this blessing: 
1KI.8.15	“Praise the 
1KI.8.16	‘From the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have never chosen a city among any of the tribes of Israel as the place where a Temple should be built to honor my name. But I have chosen David to be king over my people Israel.’”
1KI.8.17	Then Solomon said, “My father, David, wanted to build this Temple to honor the name of the 
1KI.8.18	But the 
1KI.8.19	but you are not the one to do it. One of your own sons will build the Temple to honor me.’
1KI.8.20	“And now the 
1KI.8.21	And I have prepared a place there for the Ark, which contains the covenant that the 
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the 
1KI.8.23	and he prayed,
1KI.8.23	“O 
1KI.8.24	You have kept your promise to your servant David, my father. You made that promise with your own mouth, and with your own hands you have fulfilled it today.
1KI.8.25	“And now, O 
1KI.8.26	Now, O God of Israel, fulfill this promise to your servant David, my father.
1KI.8.27	“But will God really live on earth? Why, even the highest heavens cannot contain you. How much less this Temple I have built! 
1KI.8.28	Nevertheless, listen to my prayer and my plea, O 
1KI.8.29	May you watch over this Temple night and day, this place where you have said, ‘My name will be there.’ May you always hear the prayers I make toward this place. 
1KI.8.30	May you hear the humble and earnest requests from me and your people Israel when we pray toward this place. Yes, hear us from heaven where you live, and when you hear, forgive.
1KI.8.31	“If someone wrongs another person and is required to take an oath of innocence in front of your altar in this Temple, 
1KI.8.32	then hear from heaven and judge between your servants—the accuser and the accused. Punish the guilty as they deserve. Acquit the innocent because of their innocence.
1KI.8.33	“If your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you, and if they turn to you and acknowledge your name and pray to you here in this Temple, 
1KI.8.34	then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and return them to this land you gave their ancestors.
1KI.8.35	“If the skies are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and if they pray toward this Temple and acknowledge your name and turn from their sins because you have punished them, 
1KI.8.36	then hear from heaven and forgive the sins of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them to follow the right path, and send rain on your land that you have given to your people as their special possession.
1KI.8.37	“If there is a famine in the land or a plague or crop disease or attacks of locusts or caterpillars, or if your people’s enemies are in the land besieging their towns—whatever disaster or disease there is—
1KI.8.38	and if your people Israel pray about their troubles, raising their hands toward this Temple, 
1KI.8.39	then hear from heaven where you live, and forgive. Give your people what their actions deserve, for you alone know each human heart. 
1KI.8.40	Then they will fear you as long as they live in the land you gave to our ancestors.
1KI.8.41	“In the future, foreigners who do not belong to your people Israel will hear of you. They will come from distant lands because of your name, 
1KI.8.42	for they will hear of your great name and your strong hand and your powerful arm. And when they pray toward this Temple, 
1KI.8.43	then hear from heaven where you live, and grant what they ask of you. In this way, all the people of the earth will come to know and fear you, just as your own people Israel do. They, too, will know that this Temple I have built honors your name.
1KI.8.44	“If your people go out where you send them to fight their enemies, and if they pray to the 
1KI.8.45	then hear their prayers from heaven and uphold their cause.
1KI.8.46	“If they sin against you—and who has never sinned?—you might become angry with them and let their enemies conquer them and take them captive to their land far away or near. 
1KI.8.47	But in that land of exile, they might turn to you in repentance and pray, ‘We have sinned, done evil, and acted wickedly.’ 
1KI.8.48	If they turn to you with their whole heart and soul in the land of their enemies and pray toward the land you gave to their ancestors—toward this city you have chosen, and toward this Temple I have built to honor your name—
1KI.8.49	then hear their prayers and their petition from heaven where you live, and uphold their cause. 
1KI.8.50	Forgive your people who have sinned against you. Forgive all the offenses they have committed against you. Make their captors merciful to them, 
1KI.8.51	for they are your people—your special possession—whom you brought out of the iron-smelting furnace of Egypt.
1KI.8.52	“May your eyes be open to my requests and to the requests of your people Israel. May you hear and answer them whenever they cry out to you. 
1KI.8.53	For when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt, O Sovereign 
1KI.8.54	When Solomon finished making these prayers and petitions to the 
1KI.8.55	He stood and in a loud voice blessed the entire congregation of Israel:
1KI.8.56	“Praise the 
1KI.8.57	May the 
1KI.8.58	May he give us the desire to do his will in everything and to obey all the commands, decrees, and regulations that he gave our ancestors. 
1KI.8.59	And may these words that I have prayed in the presence of the 
1KI.8.60	Then people all over the earth will know that the 
1KI.8.61	And may you be completely faithful to the 
1KI.8.62	Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices to the 
1KI.8.63	Solomon offered to the 
1KI.8.64	That same day the king consecrated the central area of the courtyard in front of the 
1KI.8.65	Then Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters
1KI.8.66	After the festival was over,
1KI.9.1	So Solomon finished building the Temple of the 
1KI.9.2	Then the 
1KI.9.3	The 
1KI.9.3	“I have heard your prayer and your petition. I have set this Temple apart to be holy—this place you have built where my name will be honored forever. I will always watch over it, for it is dear to my heart.
1KI.9.4	“As for you, if you will follow me with integrity and godliness, as David your father did, obeying all my commands, decrees, and regulations, 
1KI.9.5	then I will establish the throne of your dynasty over Israel forever. For I made this promise to your father, David: ‘One of your descendants will always sit on the throne of Israel.’
1KI.9.6	“But if you or your descendants abandon me and disobey the commands and decrees I have given you, and if you serve and worship other gods, 
1KI.9.7	then I will uproot Israel from this land that I have given them. I will reject this Temple that I have made holy to honor my name. I will make Israel an object of mockery and ridicule among the nations. 
1KI.9.8	And though this Temple is impressive now, all who pass by will be appalled and will gasp in horror. They will ask, ‘Why did the 
1KI.9.9	“And the answer will be, ‘Because his people abandoned the 
1KI.9.10	It took Solomon twenty years to build the 
1KI.9.11	he gave twenty towns in the land of Galilee to King Hiram of Tyre. (Hiram had previously provided all the cedar and cypress timber and gold that Solomon had requested.) 
1KI.9.12	But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns Solomon had given him, he was not at all pleased with them. 
1KI.9.13	“What kind of towns are these, my brother?” he asked. So Hiram called that area Cabul (which means “worthless”), as it is still known today. 
1KI.9.14	Nevertheless, Hiram paid
1KI.9.15	This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon conscripted to build the 
1KI.9.16	(Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had attacked and captured Gezer, killing the Canaanite population and burning it down. He gave the city to his daughter as a wedding gift when she married Solomon. 
1KI.9.17	So Solomon rebuilt the city of Gezer.) He also built up the towns of Lower Beth-horon, 
1KI.9.18	Baalath, and Tamar
1KI.9.19	He built towns as supply centers and constructed towns where his chariots and horses
1KI.9.20	There were still some people living in the land who were not Israelites, including Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
1KI.9.21	These were descendants of the nations whom the people of Israel had not completely destroyed.
1KI.9.22	But Solomon did not conscript any of the Israelites for forced labor. Instead, he assigned them to serve as fighting men, government officials, officers and captains in his army, commanders of his chariots, and charioteers. 
1KI.9.23	Solomon appointed 550 of them to supervise the people working on his various projects.
1KI.9.24	Solomon moved his wife, Pharaoh’s daughter, from the City of David to the new palace he had built for her. Then he constructed the supporting terraces.
1KI.9.25	Three times each year Solomon presented burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had built for the 
1KI.9.26	King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, a port near Elath
1KI.9.27	Hiram sent experienced crews of sailors to sail the ships with Solomon’s men. 
1KI.9.28	They sailed to Ophir and brought back to Solomon some sixteen tons
1KI.10.1	When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame, which brought honor to the name of the 
1KI.10.2	She arrived in Jerusalem with a large group of attendants and a great caravan of camels loaded with spices, large quantities of gold, and precious jewels. When she met with Solomon, she talked with him about everything she had on her mind. 
1KI.10.3	Solomon had answers for all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her. 
1KI.10.4	When the queen of Sheba realized how very wise Solomon was, and when she saw the palace he had built, 
1KI.10.5	she was overwhelmed. She was also amazed at the food on his tables, the organization of his officials and their splendid clothing, the cup-bearers, and the burnt offerings Solomon made at the Temple of the 
1KI.10.6	She exclaimed to the king, “Everything I heard in my country about your achievements
1KI.10.7	I didn’t believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes. In fact, I had not heard the half of it! Your wisdom and prosperity are far beyond what I was told. 
1KI.10.8	How happy your people
1KI.10.9	Praise the 
1KI.10.10	Then she gave the king a gift of 9,000 pounds
1KI.10.11	(In addition, Hiram’s ships brought gold from Ophir, and they also brought rich cargoes of red sandalwood
1KI.10.12	The king used the sandalwood to make railings for the Temple of the 
1KI.10.13	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba whatever she asked for, besides all the customary gifts he had so generously given. Then she and all her attendants returned to their own land.
1KI.10.14	Each year Solomon received about 25 tons
1KI.10.15	This did not include the additional revenue he received from merchants and traders, all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of the land.
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold, each weighing more than fifteen pounds.
1KI.10.17	He also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold, each weighing nearly four pounds.
1KI.10.18	Then the king made a huge throne, decorated with ivory and overlaid with fine gold. 
1KI.10.19	The throne had six steps and a rounded back. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, and the figure of a lion stood on each side of the throne. 
1KI.10.20	There were also twelve other lions, one standing on each end of the six steps. No other throne in all the world could be compared with it!
1KI.10.21	All of King Solomon’s drinking cups were solid gold, as were all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. They were not made of silver, for silver was considered worthless in Solomon’s day!
1KI.10.22	The king had a fleet of trading ships of Tarshish that sailed with Hiram’s fleet. Once every three years the ships returned, loaded with gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
1KI.10.23	So King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king on earth. 
1KI.10.24	People from every nation came to consult him and to hear the wisdom God had given him. 
1KI.10.25	Year after year everyone who visited brought him gifts of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
1KI.10.26	Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses.
1KI.10.27	The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah.
1KI.10.28	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt
1KI.10.29	At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver,
1KI.11.1	Now King Solomon loved many foreign women. Besides Pharaoh’s daughter, he married women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and from among the Hittites. 
1KI.11.2	The 
1KI.11.3	He had 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines. And in fact, they did turn his heart away from the 
1KI.11.4	In Solomon’s old age, they turned his heart to worship other gods instead of being completely faithful to the 
1KI.11.5	Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech,
1KI.11.6	In this way, Solomon did what was evil in the 
1KI.11.7	On the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem,
1KI.11.8	Solomon built such shrines for all his foreign wives to use for burning incense and sacrificing to their gods.
1KI.11.9	The 
1KI.11.10	He had warned Solomon specifically about worshiping other gods, but Solomon did not listen to the 
1KI.11.11	So now the 
1KI.11.12	But for the sake of your father, David, I will not do this while you are still alive. I will take the kingdom away from your son. 
1KI.11.13	And even so, I will not take away the entire kingdom; I will let him be king of one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, my chosen city.”
1KI.11.14	Then the 
1KI.11.15	Years before, David had defeated Edom. Joab, his army commander, had stayed to bury some of the Israelite soldiers who had died in battle. While there, they killed every male in Edom. 
1KI.11.16	Joab and the army of Israel had stayed there for six months, killing them.
1KI.11.17	But Hadad and a few of his father’s royal officials escaped and headed for Egypt. (Hadad was just a boy at the time.) 
1KI.11.18	They set out from Midian and went to Paran, where others joined them. Then they traveled to Egypt and went to Pharaoh, who gave them a home, food, and some land. 
1KI.11.19	Pharaoh grew very fond of Hadad, and he gave him his wife’s sister in marriage—the sister of Queen Tahpenes. 
1KI.11.20	She bore him a son named Genubath. Tahpenes raised him
1KI.11.21	When the news reached Hadad in Egypt that David and his commander Joab were both dead, he said to Pharaoh, “Let me return to my own country.”
1KI.11.22	“Why?” Pharaoh asked him. “What do you lack here that makes you want to go home?”
1KI.11.22	“Nothing,” he replied. “But even so, please let me return home.”
1KI.11.23	God also raised up Rezon son of Eliada as Solomon’s adversary. Rezon had fled from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah, 
1KI.11.24	and had become the leader of a gang of rebels. After David conquered Hadadezer, Rezon and his men fled to Damascus, where he became king. 
1KI.11.25	Rezon was Israel’s bitter adversary for the rest of Solomon’s reign, and he made trouble, just as Hadad did. Rezon hated Israel intensely and continued to reign in Aram.
1KI.11.26	Another rebel leader was Jeroboam son of Nebat, one of Solomon’s own officials. He came from the town of Zeredah in Ephraim, and his mother was Zeruah, a widow.
1KI.11.27	This is the story behind his rebellion. Solomon was rebuilding the supporting terraces
1KI.11.28	Jeroboam was a very capable young man, and when Solomon saw how industrious he was, he put him in charge of the labor force from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, the descendants of Joseph.
1KI.11.29	One day as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh met him along the way. Ahijah was wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone in a field, 
1KI.11.30	and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces. 
1KI.11.31	Then he said to Jeroboam, “Take ten of these pieces, for this is what the 
1KI.11.32	But I will leave him one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. 
1KI.11.33	For Solomon has
1KI.11.34	“‘But I will not take the entire kingdom from Solomon at this time. For the sake of my servant David, the one whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and decrees, I will keep Solomon as leader for the rest of his life. 
1KI.11.35	But I will take the kingdom away from his son and give ten of the tribes to you. 
1KI.11.36	His son will have one tribe so that the descendants of David my servant will continue to reign, shining like a lamp in Jerusalem, the city I have chosen to be the place for my name. 
1KI.11.37	And I will place you on the throne of Israel, and you will rule over all that your heart desires. 
1KI.11.38	If you listen to what I tell you and follow my ways and do whatever I consider to be right, and if you obey my decrees and commands, as my servant David did, then I will always be with you. I will establish an enduring dynasty for you as I did for David, and I will give Israel to you. 
1KI.11.39	Because of Solomon’s sin I will punish the descendants of David—though not forever.’”
1KI.11.40	Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but he fled to King Shishak of Egypt and stayed there until Solomon died.
1KI.11.41	The rest of the events in Solomon’s reign, including all his deeds and his wisdom, are recorded in 
1KI.11.42	Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. 
1KI.11.43	When he died, he was buried in the City of David, named for his father. Then his son Rehoboam became the next king.
1KI.12.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had gathered to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of this, he returned from Egypt,
1KI.12.3	The leaders of Israel summoned him, and Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel went to speak with Rehoboam. 
1KI.12.4	“Your father was a hard master,” they said. “Lighten the harsh labor demands and heavy taxes that your father imposed on us. Then we will be your loyal subjects.”
1KI.12.5	Rehoboam replied, “Give me three days to think this over. Then come back for my answer.” So the people went away.
1KI.12.6	Then King Rehoboam discussed the matter with the older men who had counseled his father, Solomon. “What is your advice?” he asked. “How should I answer these people?”
1KI.12.7	The older counselors replied, “If you are willing to be a servant to these people today and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your loyal subjects.”
1KI.12.8	But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the older men and instead asked the opinion of the young men who had grown up with him and were now his advisers. 
1KI.12.9	“What is your advice?” he asked them. “How should I answer these people who want me to lighten the burdens imposed by my father?”
1KI.12.10	The young men replied, “This is what you should tell those complainers who want a lighter burden: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! 
1KI.12.11	Yes, my father laid heavy burdens on you, but I’m going to make them even heavier! My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions!’”
1KI.12.12	Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to hear Rehoboam’s decision, just as the king had ordered. 
1KI.12.13	But Rehoboam spoke harshly to the people, for he rejected the advice of the older counselors 
1KI.12.14	and followed the counsel of his younger advisers. He told the people, “My father laid heavy burdens on you, but I’m going to make them even heavier! My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions!”
1KI.12.15	So the king paid no attention to the people. This turn of events was the will of the 
1KI.12.16	When all Israel realized that the king had refused to listen to them, they responded,
1KI.12.16	“Down with the dynasty of David!
1KI.12.16	We have no interest in the son of Jesse.
1KI.12.16	Back to your homes, O Israel!
1KI.12.16	Look out for your own house, O David!”
1KI.12.16	So the people of Israel returned home. 
1KI.12.17	But Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah.
1KI.12.18	King Rehoboam sent Adoniram,
1KI.12.19	And to this day the northern tribes of Israel have refused to be ruled by a descendant of David.
1KI.12.20	When the people of Israel learned of Jeroboam’s return from Egypt, they called an assembly and made him king over all Israel. So only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the family of David.
1KI.12.21	When Rehoboam arrived at Jerusalem, he mobilized the men of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—180,000 select troops—to fight against the men of Israel and to restore the kingdom to himself.
1KI.12.22	But God said to Shemaiah, the man of God, 
1KI.12.23	“Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the people of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, 
1KI.12.24	‘This is what the 
1KI.12.25	Jeroboam then built up the city of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and it became his capital. Later he went and built up the town of Peniel.
1KI.12.26	Jeroboam thought to himself, “Unless I am careful, the kingdom will return to the dynasty of David. 
1KI.12.27	When these people go to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices at the Temple of the 
1KI.12.28	So on the advice of his counselors, the king made two gold calves. He said to the people,
1KI.12.29	He placed these calf idols in Bethel and in Dan—at either end of his kingdom. 
1KI.12.30	But this became a great sin, for the people worshiped the idols, traveling as far north as Dan to worship the one there.
1KI.12.31	Jeroboam also erected buildings at the pagan shrines and ordained priests from the common people—those who were not from the priestly tribe of Levi. 
1KI.12.32	And Jeroboam instituted a religious festival in Bethel, held on the fifteenth day of the eighth month,
1KI.12.33	So on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a day that he himself had designated, Jeroboam offered sacrifices on the altar at Bethel. He instituted a religious festival for Israel, and he went up to the altar to burn incense.
1KI.13.1	At the 
1KI.13.2	Then at the 
1KI.13.3	That same day the man of God gave a sign to prove his message. He said, “The 
1KI.13.4	When King Jeroboam heard the man of God speaking against the altar at Bethel, he pointed at him and shouted, “Seize that man!” But instantly the king’s hand became paralyzed in that position, and he couldn’t pull it back. 
1KI.13.5	At the same time a wide crack appeared in the altar, and the ashes poured out, just as the man of God had predicted in his message from the 
1KI.13.6	The king cried out to the man of God, “Please ask the 
1KI.13.7	Then the king said to the man of God, “Come to the palace with me and have something to eat, and I will give you a gift.”
1KI.13.8	But the man of God said to the king, “Even if you gave me half of everything you own, I would not go with you. I would not eat or drink anything in this place. 
1KI.13.9	For the 
1KI.13.10	So he left Bethel and went home another way.
1KI.13.11	As it happened, there was an old prophet living in Bethel, and his sons
1KI.13.12	The old prophet asked them, “Which way did he go?” So they showed their father
1KI.13.13	“Quick, saddle the donkey,” the old man said. So they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it.
1KI.13.14	Then he rode after the man of God and found him sitting under a great tree. The old prophet asked him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?”
1KI.13.14	“Yes, I am,” he replied.
1KI.13.15	Then he said to the man of God, “Come home with me and eat some food.”
1KI.13.16	“No, I cannot,” he replied. “I am not allowed to eat or drink anything here in this place. 
1KI.13.17	For the 
1KI.13.18	But the old prophet answered, “I am a prophet, too, just as you are. And an angel gave me this command from the 
1KI.13.19	So they went back together, and the man of God ate and drank at the prophet’s home.
1KI.13.20	Then while they were sitting at the table, a command from the 
1KI.13.21	He cried out to the man of God from Judah, “This is what the 
1KI.13.22	You came back to this place and ate and drank where he told you not to eat or drink. Because of this, your body will not be buried in the grave of your ancestors.”
1KI.13.23	After the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the old prophet saddled his own donkey for him, 
1KI.13.24	and the man of God started off again. But as he was traveling along, a lion came out and killed him. His body lay there on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. 
1KI.13.25	People who passed by saw the body lying in the road and the lion standing beside it, and they went and reported it in Bethel, where the old prophet lived.
1KI.13.26	When the prophet heard the report, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the 
1KI.13.27	Then the prophet said to his sons, “Saddle a donkey for me.” So they saddled a donkey, 
1KI.13.28	and he went out and found the body lying in the road. The donkey and lion were still standing there beside it, for the lion had not eaten the body nor attacked the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	So the prophet laid the body of the man of God on the donkey and took it back to the town to mourn over him and bury him. 
1KI.13.30	He laid the body in his own grave, crying out in grief, “Oh, my brother!”
1KI.13.31	Afterward the prophet said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones. 
1KI.13.32	For the message the 
1KI.13.33	But even after this, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil ways. He continued to choose priests from the common people. He appointed anyone who wanted to become a priest for the pagan shrines. 
1KI.13.34	This became a great sin and resulted in the utter destruction of Jeroboam’s dynasty from the face of the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time Jeroboam’s son Abijah became very sick. 
1KI.14.2	So Jeroboam told his wife, “Disguise yourself so that no one will recognize you as my wife. Then go to the prophet Ahijah at Shiloh—the man who told me I would become king. 
1KI.14.3	Take him a gift of ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and ask him what will happen to the boy.”
1KI.14.4	So Jeroboam’s wife went to Ahijah’s home at Shiloh. He was an old man now and could no longer see. 
1KI.14.5	But the 
1KI.14.6	So when Ahijah heard her footsteps at the door, he called out, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you pretending to be someone else?” Then he told her, “I have bad news for you. 
1KI.14.7	Give your husband, Jeroboam, this message from the 
1KI.14.8	I ripped the kingdom away from the family of David and gave it to you. But you have not been like my servant David, who obeyed my commands and followed me with all his heart and always did whatever I wanted. 
1KI.14.9	You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made other gods for yourself and have made me furious with your gold calves. And since you have turned your back on me, 
1KI.14.10	I will bring disaster on your dynasty and will destroy every one of your male descendants, slave and free alike, anywhere in Israel. I will burn up your royal dynasty as one burns up trash until it is all gone. 
1KI.14.11	The members of Jeroboam’s family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by vultures. I, the 
1KI.14.12	Then Ahijah said to Jeroboam’s wife, “Go on home, and when you enter the city, the child will die. 
1KI.14.13	All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only member of your family who will have a proper burial, for this child is the only good thing that the 
1KI.14.14	“In addition, the 
1KI.14.15	Then the 
1KI.14.16	He will abandon Israel because Jeroboam sinned and made Israel sin along with him.”
1KI.14.17	So Jeroboam’s wife returned to Tirzah, and the child died just as she walked through the door of her home. 
1KI.14.18	And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, as the 
1KI.14.19	The rest of the events in Jeroboam’s reign, including all his wars and how he ruled, are recorded in 
1KI.14.20	Jeroboam reigned in Israel twenty-two years. When Jeroboam died, his son Nadab became the next king.
1KI.14.21	Meanwhile, Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the 
1KI.14.22	During Rehoboam’s reign, the people of Judah did what was evil in the 
1KI.14.23	For they also built for themselves pagan shrines and set up sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree. 
1KI.14.24	There were even male and female shrine prostitutes throughout the land. The people imitated the detestable practices of the pagan nations the 
1KI.14.25	In the fifth year of King Rehoboam’s reign, King Shishak of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem. 
1KI.14.26	He ransacked the treasuries of the 
1KI.14.27	King Rehoboam later replaced them with bronze shields as substitutes, and he entrusted them to the care of the commanders of the guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace. 
1KI.14.28	Whenever the king went to the Temple of the 
1KI.14.29	The rest of the events in Rehoboam’s reign and everything he did are recorded in 
1KI.14.30	There was constant war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 
1KI.14.31	When Rehoboam died, he was buried among his ancestors in the City of David. His mother was Naamah, an Ammonite woman. Then his son Abijam
1KI.15.1	Abijam
1KI.15.2	He reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother was Maacah, the granddaughter of Absalom.
1KI.15.3	He committed the same sins as his father before him, and he was not faithful to the 
1KI.15.4	But for David’s sake, the 
1KI.15.5	For David had done what was pleasing in the 
1KI.15.6	There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam
1KI.15.7	The rest of the events in Abijam’s reign and everything he did are recorded in 
1KI.15.8	When Abijam died, he was buried in the City of David. Then his son Asa became the next king.
1KI.15.9	Asa began to rule over Judah in the twentieth year of Jeroboam’s reign in Israel. 
1KI.15.10	He reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years. His grandmother
1KI.15.11	Asa did what was pleasing in the 
1KI.15.12	He banished the male and female shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols
1KI.15.13	He even deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made an obscene Asherah pole. He cut down her obscene pole and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
1KI.15.14	Although the pagan shrines were not removed, Asa’s heart remained completely faithful to the 
1KI.15.15	He brought into the Temple of the 
1KI.15.16	There was constant war between King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel. 
1KI.15.17	King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from entering or leaving King Asa’s territory in Judah.
1KI.15.18	Asa responded by removing all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the Temple of the 
1KI.15.19	“Let there be a treaty
1KI.15.20	Ben-hadad agreed to King Asa’s request and sent the commanders of his army to attack the towns of Israel. They conquered the towns of Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Kinnereth, and all the land of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	As soon as Baasha of Israel heard what was happening, he abandoned his project of fortifying Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah. 
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa sent an order throughout Judah, requiring that everyone, without exception, help to carry away the building stones and timbers that Baasha had been using to fortify Ramah. Asa used these materials to fortify the town of Geba in Benjamin and the town of Mizpah.
1KI.15.23	The rest of the events in Asa’s reign—the extent of his power, everything he did, and the names of the cities he built—are recorded in 
1KI.15.24	When Asa died, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David.
1KI.15.24	Then Jehoshaphat, Asa’s son, became the next king.
1KI.15.25	Nadab son of Jeroboam began to rule over Israel in the second year of King Asa’s reign in Judah. He reigned in Israel two years. 
1KI.15.26	But he did what was evil in the 
1KI.15.27	Then Baasha son of Ahijah, from the tribe of Issachar, plotted against Nadab and assassinated him while he and the Israelite army were laying siege to the Philistine town of Gibbethon. 
1KI.15.28	Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of King Asa’s reign in Judah, and he became the next king of Israel.
1KI.15.29	He immediately slaughtered all the descendants of King Jeroboam, so that not one of the royal family was left, just as the 
1KI.15.30	This was done because Jeroboam had provoked the anger of the 
1KI.15.31	The rest of the events in Nadab’s reign and everything he did are recorded in 
1KI.15.32	There was constant war between King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel. 
1KI.15.33	Baasha son of Ahijah began to rule over all Israel in the third year of King Asa’s reign in Judah. Baasha reigned in Tirzah twenty-four years. 
1KI.15.34	But he did what was evil in the 
1KI.16.1	This message from the 
1KI.16.2	“I lifted you out of the dust to make you ruler of my people Israel, but you have followed the evil example of Jeroboam. You have provoked my anger by causing my people Israel to sin. 
1KI.16.3	So now I will destroy you and your family, just as I destroyed the descendants of Jeroboam son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	The members of Baasha’s family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by vultures.”
1KI.16.5	The rest of the events in Baasha’s reign and the extent of his power are recorded in 
1KI.16.6	When Baasha died, he was buried in Tirzah. Then his son Elah became the next king.
1KI.16.7	The message from the 
1KI.16.8	Elah son of Baasha began to rule over Israel in the twenty-sixth year of King Asa’s reign in Judah. He reigned in the city of Tirzah for two years.
1KI.16.9	Then Zimri, who commanded half of the royal chariots, made plans to kill him. One day in Tirzah, Elah was getting drunk at the home of Arza, the supervisor of the palace. 
1KI.16.10	Zimri walked in and struck him down and killed him. This happened in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa’s reign in Judah. Then Zimri became the next king.
1KI.16.11	Zimri immediately killed the entire royal family of Baasha, leaving him not even a single male child. He even destroyed distant relatives and friends. 
1KI.16.12	So Zimri destroyed the dynasty of Baasha as the 
1KI.16.13	This happened because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed, and because of the sins they led Israel to commit. They provoked the anger of the 
1KI.16.14	The rest of the events in Elah’s reign and everything he did are recorded in 
1KI.16.15	Zimri began to rule over Israel in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa’s reign in Judah, but his reign in Tirzah lasted only seven days. The army of Israel was then attacking the Philistine town of Gibbethon. 
1KI.16.16	When they heard that Zimri had committed treason and had assassinated the king, that very day they chose Omri, commander of the army, as the new king of Israel. 
1KI.16.17	So Omri led the entire army of Israel up from Gibbethon to attack Tirzah, Israel’s capital. 
1KI.16.18	When Zimri saw that the city had been taken, he went into the citadel of the palace and burned it down over himself and died in the flames. 
1KI.16.19	For he, too, had done what was evil in the 
1KI.16.20	The rest of the events in Zimri’s reign and his conspiracy are recorded in 
1KI.16.21	But now the people of Israel were split into two factions. Half the people tried to make Tibni son of Ginath their king, while the other half supported Omri. 
1KI.16.22	But Omri’s supporters defeated the supporters of Tibni. So Tibni was killed, and Omri became the next king.
1KI.16.23	Omri began to rule over Israel in the thirty-first year of King Asa’s reign in Judah. He reigned twelve years in all, six of them in Tirzah. 
1KI.16.24	Then Omri bought the hill now known as Samaria from its owner, Shemer, for 150 pounds of silver.
1KI.16.25	But Omri did what was evil in the 
1KI.16.26	He followed the example of Jeroboam son of Nebat in all the sins he had committed and led Israel to commit. The people provoked the anger of the 
1KI.16.27	The rest of the events in Omri’s reign, the extent of his power, and everything he did are recorded in 
1KI.16.28	When Omri died, he was buried in Samaria. Then his son Ahab became the next king.
1KI.16.29	Ahab son of Omri began to rule over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of King Asa’s reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria twenty-two years. 
1KI.16.30	But Ahab son of Omri did what was evil in the 
1KI.16.31	And as though it were not enough to follow the sinful example of Jeroboam, he married Jezebel, the daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians, and he began to bow down in worship of Baal. 
1KI.16.32	First Ahab built a temple and an altar for Baal in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	Then he set up an Asherah pole. He did more to provoke the anger of the 
1KI.16.34	It was during his reign that Hiel, a man from Bethel, rebuilt Jericho. When he laid its foundations, it cost him the life of his oldest son, Abiram. And when he completed it and set up its gates, it cost him the life of his youngest son, Segub.
1KI.17.1	Now Elijah, who was from Tishbe in Gilead, told King Ahab, “As surely as the 
1KI.17.2	Then the 
1KI.17.3	“Go to the east and hide by Kerith Brook, near where it enters the Jordan River. 
1KI.17.4	Drink from the brook and eat what the ravens bring you, for I have commanded them to bring you food.”
1KI.17.5	So Elijah did as the 
1KI.17.6	The ravens brought him bread and meat each morning and evening, and he drank from the brook. 
1KI.17.7	But after a while the brook dried up, for there was no rainfall anywhere in the land.
1KI.17.8	Then the 
1KI.17.9	“Go and live in the village of Zarephath, near the city of Sidon. I have instructed a widow there to feed you.”
1KI.17.10	So he went to Zarephath. As he arrived at the gates of the village, he saw a widow gathering sticks, and he asked her, “Would you please bring me a little water in a cup?” 
1KI.17.11	As she was going to get it, he called to her, “Bring me a bite of bread, too.”
1KI.17.12	But she said, “I swear by the 
1KI.17.13	But Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid! Go ahead and do just what you’ve said, but make a little bread for me first. Then use what’s left to prepare a meal for yourself and your son. 
1KI.17.14	For this is what the 
1KI.17.15	So she did as Elijah said, and she and Elijah and her family continued to eat for many days. 
1KI.17.16	There was always enough flour and olive oil left in the containers, just as the 
1KI.17.17	Some time later the woman’s son became sick. He grew worse and worse, and finally he died. 
1KI.17.18	Then she said to Elijah, “O man of God, what have you done to me? Have you come here to point out my sins and kill my son?”
1KI.17.19	But Elijah replied, “Give me your son.” And he took the child’s body from her arms, carried him up the stairs to the room where he was staying, and laid the body on his bed. 
1KI.17.20	Then Elijah cried out to the 
1KI.17.21	And he stretched himself out over the child three times and cried out to the 
1KI.17.22	The 
1KI.17.23	Then Elijah brought him down from the upper room and gave him to his mother. “Look!” he said. “Your son is alive!”
1KI.17.24	Then the woman told Elijah, “Now I know for sure that you are a man of God, and that the 
1KI.18.1	Later on, in the third year of the drought, the 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah went to appear before Ahab.
1KI.18.2	Meanwhile, the famine had become very severe in Samaria. 
1KI.18.3	So Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Obadiah was a devoted follower of the 
1KI.18.4	Once when Jezebel had tried to kill all the 
1KI.18.5	Ahab said to Obadiah, “We must check every spring and valley in the land to see if we can find enough grass to save at least some of my horses and mules.” 
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
1KI.18.7	As Obadiah was walking along, he suddenly saw Elijah coming toward him. Obadiah recognized him at once and bowed low to the ground before him. “Is it really you, my lord Elijah?” he asked.
1KI.18.8	“Yes, it is,” Elijah replied. “Now go and tell your master, ‘Elijah is here.’”
1KI.18.9	“Oh, sir,” Obadiah protested, “what harm have I done to you that you are sending me to my death at the hands of Ahab? 
1KI.18.10	For I swear by the 
1KI.18.11	And now you say, ‘Go and tell your master, “Elijah is here.”’ 
1KI.18.12	But as soon as I leave you, the Spirit of the 
1KI.18.13	Has no one told you, my lord, about the time when Jezebel was trying to kill the 
1KI.18.14	And now you say, ‘Go and tell your master, “Elijah is here.”’ Sir, if I do that, Ahab will certainly kill me.”
1KI.18.15	But Elijah said, “I swear by the 
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to tell Ahab that Elijah had come, and Ahab went out to meet Elijah. 
1KI.18.17	When Ahab saw him, he exclaimed, “So, is it really you, you troublemaker of Israel?”
1KI.18.18	“I have made no trouble for Israel,” Elijah replied. “You and your family are the troublemakers, for you have refused to obey the commands of the 
1KI.18.19	Now summon all Israel to join me at Mount Carmel, along with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who are supported by Jezebel.
1KI.18.20	So Ahab summoned all the people of Israel and the prophets to Mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	Then Elijah stood in front of them and said, “How much longer will you waver, hobbling between two opinions? If the 
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to them, “I am the only prophet of the 
1KI.18.23	Now bring two bulls. The prophets of Baal may choose whichever one they wish and cut it into pieces and lay it on the wood of their altar, but without setting fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood on the altar, but not set fire to it. 
1KI.18.24	Then call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the 
1KI.18.25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “You go first, for there are many of you. Choose one of the bulls, and prepare it and call on the name of your god. But do not set fire to the wood.”
1KI.18.26	So they prepared one of the bulls and placed it on the altar. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning until noontime, shouting, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no reply of any kind. Then they danced, hobbling around the altar they had made.
1KI.18.27	About noontime Elijah began mocking them. “You’ll have to shout louder,” he scoffed, “for surely he is a god! Perhaps he is daydreaming, or is relieving himself.
1KI.18.28	So they shouted louder, and following their normal custom, they cut themselves with knives and swords until the blood gushed out. 
1KI.18.29	They raved all afternoon until the time of the evening sacrifice, but still there was no sound, no reply, no response.
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah called to the people, “Come over here!” They all crowded around him as he repaired the altar of the 
1KI.18.31	He took twelve stones, one to represent each of the tribes of Israel,
1KI.18.32	and he used the stones to rebuild the altar in the name of the 
1KI.18.33	He piled wood on the altar, cut the bull into pieces, and laid the pieces on the wood.
1KI.18.33	Then he said, “Fill four large jars with water, and pour the water over the offering and the wood.”
1KI.18.34	After they had done this, he said, “Do the same thing again!” And when they were finished, he said, “Now do it a third time!” So they did as he said, 
1KI.18.35	and the water ran around the altar and even filled the trench.
1KI.18.36	At the usual time for offering the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet walked up to the altar and prayed, “O 
1KI.18.37	O 
1KI.18.38	Immediately the fire of the 
1KI.18.39	And when all the people saw it, they fell face down on the ground and cried out, “The 
1KI.18.40	Then Elijah commanded, “Seize all the prophets of Baal. Don’t let a single one escape!” So the people seized them all, and Elijah took them down to the Kishon Valley and killed them there.
1KI.18.41	Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go get something to eat and drink, for I hear a mighty rainstorm coming!”
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went to eat and drink. But Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel and bowed low to the ground and prayed with his face between his knees.
1KI.18.43	Then he said to his servant, “Go and look out toward the sea.”
1KI.18.43	The servant went and looked, then returned to Elijah and said, “I didn’t see anything.”
1KI.18.43	Seven times Elijah told him to go and look. 
1KI.18.44	Finally the seventh time, his servant told him, “I saw a little cloud about the size of a man’s hand rising from the sea.”
1KI.18.44	Then Elijah shouted, “Hurry to Ahab and tell him, ‘Climb into your chariot and go back home. If you don’t hurry, the rain will stop you!’”
1KI.18.45	And soon the sky was black with clouds. A heavy wind brought a terrific rainstorm, and Ahab left quickly for Jezreel. 
1KI.18.46	Then the 
1KI.19.1	When Ahab got home, he told Jezebel everything Elijah had done, including the way he had killed all the prophets of Baal. 
1KI.19.2	So Jezebel sent this message to Elijah: “May the gods strike me and even kill me if by this time tomorrow I have not killed you just as you killed them.”
1KI.19.3	Elijah was afraid and fled for his life. He went to Beersheba, a town in Judah, and he left his servant there. 
1KI.19.4	Then he went on alone into the wilderness, traveling all day. He sat down under a solitary broom tree and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, 
1KI.19.5	Then he lay down and slept under the broom tree. But as he was sleeping, an angel touched him and told him, “Get up and eat!” 
1KI.19.6	He looked around and there beside his head was some bread baked on hot stones and a jar of water! So he ate and drank and lay down again.
1KI.19.7	Then the angel of the 
1KI.19.8	So he got up and ate and drank, and the food gave him enough strength to travel forty days and forty nights to Mount Sinai,
1KI.19.9	There he came to a cave, where he spent the night.
1KI.19.9	But the 
1KI.19.10	Elijah replied, “I have zealously served the 
1KI.19.11	“Go out and stand before me on the mountain,” the 
1KI.19.12	And after the earthquake there was a fire, but the 
1KI.19.13	When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave.
1KI.19.13	And a voice said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
1KI.19.14	He replied again, “I have zealously served the 
1KI.19.15	Then the 
1KI.19.16	Then anoint Jehu grandson of Nimshi
1KI.19.17	Anyone who escapes from Hazael will be killed by Jehu, and those who escape Jehu will be killed by Elisha! 
1KI.19.18	Yet I will preserve 7,000 others in Israel who have never bowed down to Baal or kissed him!”
1KI.19.19	So Elijah went and found Elisha son of Shaphat plowing a field. There were twelve teams of oxen in the field, and Elisha was plowing with the twelfth team. Elijah went over to him and threw his cloak across his shoulders and then walked away. 
1KI.19.20	Elisha left the oxen standing there, ran after Elijah, and said to him, “First let me go and kiss my father and mother good-bye, and then I will go with you!”
1KI.19.20	Elijah replied, “Go on back, but think about what I have done to you.”
1KI.19.21	So Elisha returned to his oxen and slaughtered them. He used the wood from the plow to build a fire to roast their flesh. He passed around the meat to the townspeople, and they all ate. Then he went with Elijah as his assistant.
1KI.20.1	About that time King Ben-hadad of Aram mobilized his army, supported by the chariots and horses of thirty-two allied kings. They went to besiege Samaria, the capital of Israel, and launched attacks against it. 
1KI.20.2	Ben-hadad sent messengers into the city to relay this message to King Ahab of Israel: “This is what Ben-hadad says: 
1KI.20.3	‘Your silver and gold are mine, and so are your wives and the best of your children!’”
1KI.20.4	“All right, my lord the king,” Israel’s king replied. “All that I have is yours!”
1KI.20.5	Soon Ben-hadad’s messengers returned again and said, “This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘I have already demanded that you give me your silver, gold, wives, and children. 
1KI.20.6	But about this time tomorrow I will send my officials to search your palace and the homes of your officials. They will take away everything you consider valuable!’”
1KI.20.7	Then Ahab summoned all the elders of the land and said to them, “Look how this man is stirring up trouble! I already agreed with his demand that I give him my wives and children and silver and gold.”
1KI.20.8	“Don’t give in to any more demands,” all the elders and the people advised.
1KI.20.9	So Ahab told the messengers from Ben-hadad, “Say this to my lord the king: ‘I will give you everything you asked for the first time, but I cannot accept this last demand of yours.’” So the messengers returned to Ben-hadad with that response.
1KI.20.10	Then Ben-hadad sent this message to Ahab: “May the gods strike me and even kill me if there remains enough dust from Samaria to provide even a handful for each of my soldiers.”
1KI.20.11	The king of Israel sent back this answer: “A warrior putting on his sword for battle should not boast like a warrior who has already won.”
1KI.20.12	Ahab’s reply reached Ben-hadad and the other kings as they were drinking in their tents.
1KI.20.13	Then a certain prophet came to see King Ahab of Israel and told him, “This is what the 
1KI.20.14	Ahab asked, “How will he do it?”
1KI.20.14	And the prophet replied, “This is what the 
1KI.20.14	“Should we attack first?” Ahab asked.
1KI.20.14	“Yes,” the prophet answered.
1KI.20.15	So Ahab mustered the troops of the 232 provincial commanders. Then he called out the rest of the army of Israel, some 7,000 men. 
1KI.20.16	About noontime, as Ben-hadad and the thirty-two allied kings were still in their tents drinking themselves into a stupor, 
1KI.20.17	the troops of the provincial commanders marched out of the city as the first contingent.
1KI.20.17	As they approached, Ben-hadad’s scouts reported to him, “Some troops are coming from Samaria.”
1KI.20.18	“Take them alive,” Ben-hadad commanded, “whether they have come for peace or for war.”
1KI.20.19	But Ahab’s provincial commanders and the entire army had now come out to fight. 
1KI.20.20	Each Israelite soldier killed his Aramean opponent, and suddenly the entire Aramean army panicked and fled. The Israelites chased them, but King Ben-hadad and a few of his charioteers escaped on horses. 
1KI.20.21	However, the king of Israel destroyed the other horses and chariots and slaughtered the Arameans.
1KI.20.22	Afterward the prophet said to King Ahab, “Get ready for another attack. Begin making plans now, for the king of Aram will come back next spring.
1KI.20.23	After their defeat, Ben-hadad’s officers said to him, “The Israelite gods are gods of the hills; that is why they won. But we can beat them easily on the plains. 
1KI.20.24	Only this time replace the kings with field commanders! 
1KI.20.25	Recruit another army like the one you lost. Give us the same number of horses, chariots, and men, and we will fight against them on the plains. There’s no doubt that we will beat them.” So King Ben-hadad did as they suggested.
1KI.20.26	The following spring he called up the Aramean army and marched out against Israel, this time at Aphek. 
1KI.20.27	Israel then mustered its army, set up supply lines, and marched out for battle. But the Israelite army looked like two little flocks of goats in comparison to the vast Aramean forces that filled the countryside!
1KI.20.28	Then the man of God went to the king of Israel and said, “This is what the 
1KI.20.29	The two armies camped opposite each other for seven days, and on the seventh day the battle began. The Israelites killed 100,000 Aramean foot soldiers in one day. 
1KI.20.30	The rest fled into the town of Aphek, but the wall fell on them and killed another 27,000. Ben-hadad fled into the town and hid in a secret room.
1KI.20.31	Ben-hadad’s officers said to him, “Sir, we have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful. So let’s humble ourselves by wearing burlap around our waists and putting ropes on our heads, and surrender to the king of Israel. Then perhaps he will let you live.”
1KI.20.32	So they put on burlap and ropes, and they went to the king of Israel and begged, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please let me live!’”
1KI.20.32	The king of Israel responded, “Is he still alive? He is my brother!”
1KI.20.33	The men took this as a good sign and quickly picked up on his words. “Yes,” they said, “your brother Ben-hadad!”
1KI.20.33	“Go and get him,” the king of Israel told them. And when Ben-hadad arrived, Ahab invited him up into his chariot.
1KI.20.34	Ben-hadad told him, “I will give back the towns my father took from your father, and you may establish places of trade in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.”
1KI.20.34	Then Ahab said, “I will release you under these conditions.” So they made a new treaty, and Ben-hadad was set free.
1KI.20.35	Meanwhile, the 
1KI.20.36	Then the prophet told him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the 
1KI.20.37	Then the prophet turned to another man and said, “Hit me!” So he struck the prophet and wounded him.
1KI.20.38	The prophet placed a bandage over his eyes to disguise himself and then waited beside the road for the king. 
1KI.20.39	As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, “Sir, I was in the thick of battle, and suddenly a man brought me a prisoner. He said, ‘Guard this man; if for any reason he gets away, you will either die or pay a fine of seventy-five pounds
1KI.20.40	But while I was busy doing something else, the prisoner disappeared!”
1KI.20.40	“Well, it’s your own fault,” the king replied. “You have brought the judgment on yourself.”
1KI.20.41	Then the prophet quickly pulled the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	The prophet said to him, “This is what the 
1KI.20.43	So the king of Israel went home to Samaria angry and sullen.
1KI.21.1	Now there was a man named Naboth, from Jezreel, who owned a vineyard in Jezreel beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria. 
1KI.21.2	One day Ahab said to Naboth, “Since your vineyard is so convenient to my palace, I would like to buy it to use as a vegetable garden. I will give you a better vineyard in exchange, or if you prefer, I will pay you for it.”
1KI.21.3	But Naboth replied, “The 
1KI.21.4	So Ahab went home angry and sullen because of Naboth’s answer. The king went to bed with his face to the wall and refused to eat!
1KI.21.5	“What’s the matter?” his wife Jezebel asked him. “What’s made you so upset that you’re not eating?”
1KI.21.6	“I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or trade it, but he refused!” Ahab told her.
1KI.21.7	“Are you the king of Israel or not?” Jezebel demanded. “Get up and eat something, and don’t worry about it. I’ll get you Naboth’s vineyard!”
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and other leaders of the town where Naboth lived. 
1KI.21.9	In her letters she commanded: “Call the citizens together for a time of fasting, and give Naboth a place of honor. 
1KI.21.10	And then seat two scoundrels across from him who will accuse him of cursing God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death.”
1KI.21.11	So the elders and other town leaders followed the instructions Jezebel had written in the letters. 
1KI.21.12	They called for a fast and put Naboth at a prominent place before the people. 
1KI.21.13	Then the two scoundrels came and sat down across from him. And they accused Naboth before all the people, saying, “He cursed God and the king.” So he was dragged outside the town and stoned to death. 
1KI.21.14	The town leaders then sent word to Jezebel, “Naboth has been stoned to death.”
1KI.21.15	When Jezebel heard the news, she said to Ahab, “You know the vineyard Naboth wouldn’t sell you? Well, you can have it now! He’s dead!” 
1KI.21.16	So Ahab immediately went down to the vineyard of Naboth to claim it.
1KI.21.17	But the 
1KI.21.18	“Go down to meet King Ahab of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He will be at Naboth’s vineyard in Jezreel, claiming it for himself. 
1KI.21.19	Give him this message: ‘This is what the 
1KI.21.20	“So, my enemy, you have found me!” Ahab exclaimed to Elijah.
1KI.21.20	“Yes,” Elijah answered, “I have come because you have sold yourself to what is evil in the 
1KI.21.21	So now the 
1KI.21.22	I am going to destroy your family as I did the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat and the family of Baasha son of Ahijah, for you have made me very angry and have led Israel into sin.’
1KI.21.23	“And regarding Jezebel, the 
1KI.21.24	“The members of Ahab’s family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by vultures.”
1KI.21.25	(No one else so completely sold himself to what was evil in the 
1KI.21.26	His worst outrage was worshiping idols
1KI.21.27	But when Ahab heard this message, he tore his clothing, dressed in burlap, and fasted. He even slept in burlap and went about in deep mourning.
1KI.21.28	Then another message from the 
1KI.21.29	“Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has done this, I will not do what I promised during his lifetime. It will happen to his sons; I will destroy his dynasty.”
1KI.22.1	For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel. 
1KI.22.2	Then during the third year, King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit King Ahab of Israel. 
1KI.22.3	During the visit, the king of Israel said to his officials, “Do you realize that the town of Ramoth-gilead belongs to us? And yet we’ve done nothing to recapture it from the king of Aram!”
1KI.22.4	Then he turned to Jehoshaphat and asked, “Will you join me in battle to recover Ramoth-gilead?”
1KI.22.4	Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “Why, of course! You and I are as one. My troops are your troops, and my horses are your horses.” 
1KI.22.5	Then Jehoshaphat added, “But first let’s find out what the 
1KI.22.6	So the king of Israel summoned the prophets, about 400 of them, and asked them, “Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold back?”
1KI.22.6	They all replied, “Yes, go right ahead! The Lord will give the king victory.”
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not also a prophet of the 
1KI.22.8	The king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, “There is one more man who could consult the 
1KI.22.8	Jehoshaphat replied, “That’s not the way a king should talk! Let’s hear what he has to say.”
1KI.22.9	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Quick! Bring Micaiah son of Imlah.”
1KI.22.10	King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on thrones at the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria. All of Ahab’s prophets were prophesying there in front of them. 
1KI.22.11	One of them, Zedekiah son of Kenaanah, made some iron horns and proclaimed, “This is what the 
1KI.22.12	All the other prophets agreed. “Yes,” they said, “go up to Ramoth-gilead and be victorious, for the 
1KI.22.13	Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him, “Look, all the prophets are promising victory for the king. Be sure that you agree with them and promise success.”
1KI.22.14	But Micaiah replied, “As surely as the 
1KI.22.15	When Micaiah arrived before the king, Ahab asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we hold back?”
1KI.22.15	Micaiah replied sarcastically, “Yes, go up and be victorious, for the 
1KI.22.16	But the king replied sharply, “How many times must I demand that you speak only the truth to me when you speak for the 
1KI.22.17	Then Micaiah told him, “In a vision I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the 
1KI.22.18	“Didn’t I tell you?” the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat. “He never prophesies anything but trouble for me.”
1KI.22.19	Then Micaiah continued, “Listen to what the 
1KI.22.20	And the 
1KI.22.20	“There were many suggestions, 
1KI.22.21	and finally a spirit approached the 
1KI.22.22	“‘How will you do this?’ the 
1KI.22.22	“And the spirit replied, ‘I will go out and inspire all of Ahab’s prophets to speak lies.’
1KI.22.22	“‘You will succeed,’ said the 
1KI.22.23	“So you see, the 
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face. “Since when did the Spirit of the 
1KI.22.25	And Micaiah replied, “You will find out soon enough when you are trying to hide in some secret room!”
1KI.22.26	“Arrest him!” the king of Israel ordered. “Take him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to my son Joash. 
1KI.22.27	Give them this order from the king: ‘Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return safely from the battle!’”
1KI.22.28	But Micaiah replied, “If you return safely, it will mean that the 
1KI.22.29	So King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah led their armies against Ramoth-gilead. 
1KI.22.30	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “As we go into battle, I will disguise myself so no one will recognize me, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
1KI.22.31	Meanwhile, the king of Aram had issued these orders to his thirty-two chariot commanders: “Attack only the king of Israel. Don’t bother with anyone else!” 
1KI.22.32	So when the Aramean chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they went after him. “There is the king of Israel!” they shouted. But when Jehoshaphat called out, 
1KI.22.33	the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, and they stopped chasing him.
1KI.22.34	An Aramean soldier, however, randomly shot an arrow at the Israelite troops and hit the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. “Turn the horses
1KI.22.35	The battle raged all that day, and the king remained propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran down to the floor of his chariot, and as evening arrived he died. 
1KI.22.36	Just as the sun was setting, the cry ran through his troops: “We’re done for! Run for your lives!”
1KI.22.37	So the king died, and his body was taken to Samaria and buried there. 
1KI.22.38	Then his chariot was washed beside the pool of Samaria, and dogs came and licked his blood at the place where the prostitutes bathed,
1KI.22.39	The rest of the events in Ahab’s reign and everything he did, including the story of the ivory palace and the towns he built, are recorded in 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab died, and his son Ahaziah became the next king.
1KI.22.41	Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to rule over Judah in the fourth year of King Ahab’s reign in Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
1KI.22.43	Jehoshaphat was a good king, following the example of his father, Asa. He did what was pleasing in the 
1KI.22.44	Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	The rest of the events in Jehoshaphat’s reign, the extent of his power, and the wars he waged are recorded in 
1KI.22.46	He banished from the land the rest of the male and female shrine prostitutes, who still continued their practices from the days of his father, Asa.
1KI.22.47	(There was no king in Edom at that time, only a deputy.)
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat also built a fleet of trading ships
1KI.22.49	At one time Ahaziah son of Ahab had proposed to Jehoshaphat, “Let my men sail with your men in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat refused the request.
1KI.22.50	When Jehoshaphat died, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Jehoram became the next king.
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah son of Ahab began to rule over Israel in the seventeenth year of King Jehoshaphat’s reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria two years. 
1KI.22.52	But he did what was evil in the 
1KI.22.53	He served Baal and worshiped him, provoking the anger of the 
2KI.1.1	After King Ahab’s death, the land of Moab rebelled against Israel.
2KI.1.2	One day Israel’s new king, Ahaziah, fell through the latticework of an upper room at his palace in Samaria and was seriously injured. So he sent messengers to the temple of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, to ask whether he would recover.
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the 
2KI.1.4	Now, therefore, this is what the 
2KI.1.5	When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have you returned so soon?”
2KI.1.6	They replied, “A man came up to us and told us to go back to the king and give him this message. ‘This is what the 
2KI.1.7	“What sort of man was he?” the king demanded. “What did he look like?”
2KI.1.8	They replied, “He was a hairy man,
2KI.1.8	“Elijah from Tishbe!” the king exclaimed.
2KI.1.9	Then he sent an army captain with fifty soldiers to arrest him. They found him sitting on top of a hill. The captain said to him, “Man of God, the king has commanded you to come down with us.”
2KI.1.10	But Elijah replied to the captain, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your fifty men!” Then fire fell from heaven and killed them all.
2KI.1.11	So the king sent another captain with fifty men. The captain said to him, “Man of God, the king demands that you come down at once.”
2KI.1.12	Elijah replied, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your fifty men!” And again the fire of God fell from heaven and killed them all.
2KI.1.13	Once more the king sent a third captain with fifty men. But this time the captain went up the hill and fell to his knees before Elijah. He pleaded with him, “O man of God, please spare my life and the lives of these, your fifty servants. 
2KI.1.14	See how the fire from heaven came down and destroyed the first two groups. But now please spare my life!”
2KI.1.15	Then the angel of the 
2KI.1.16	And Elijah said to the king, “This is what the 
2KI.1.17	So Ahaziah died, just as the 
2KI.1.18	The rest of the events in Ahaziah’s reign and everything he did are recorded in 
2KI.2.1	When the 
2KI.2.2	And Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, for the 
2KI.2.2	But Elisha replied, “As surely as the 
2KI.2.3	The group of prophets from Bethel came to Elisha and asked him, “Did you know that the 
2KI.2.3	“Of course I know,” Elisha answered. “But be quiet about it.”
2KI.2.4	Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, for the 
2KI.2.4	But Elisha replied again, “As surely as the 
2KI.2.5	Then the group of prophets from Jericho came to Elisha and asked him, “Did you know that the 
2KI.2.5	“Of course I know,” Elisha answered. “But be quiet about it.”
2KI.2.6	Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, for the 
2KI.2.6	But again Elisha replied, “As surely as the 
2KI.2.7	Fifty men from the group of prophets also went and watched from a distance as Elijah and Elisha stopped beside the Jordan River. 
2KI.2.8	Then Elijah folded his cloak together and struck the water with it. The river divided, and the two of them went across on dry ground!
2KI.2.9	When they came to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I can do for you before I am taken away.”
2KI.2.9	And Elisha replied, “Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit and become your successor.”
2KI.2.10	“You have asked a difficult thing,” Elijah replied. “If you see me when I am taken from you, then you will get your request. But if not, then you won’t.”
2KI.2.11	As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire appeared, drawn by horses of fire. It drove between the two men, separating them, and Elijah was carried by a whirlwind into heaven. 
2KI.2.12	Elisha saw it and cried out, “My father! My father! I see the chariots and charioteers of Israel!” And as they disappeared from sight, Elisha tore his clothes in distress.
2KI.2.13	Elisha picked up Elijah’s cloak, which had fallen when he was taken up. Then Elisha returned to the bank of the Jordan River. 
2KI.2.14	He struck the water with Elijah’s cloak and cried out, “Where is the 
2KI.2.15	When the group of prophets from Jericho saw from a distance what happened, they exclaimed, “Elijah’s spirit rests upon Elisha!” And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him. 
2KI.2.16	“Sir,” they said, “just say the word and fifty of our strongest men will search the wilderness for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the 
2KI.2.16	“No,” Elisha said, “don’t send them.” 
2KI.2.17	But they kept urging him until they shamed him into agreeing, and he finally said, “All right, send them.” So fifty men searched for three days but did not find Elijah. 
2KI.2.18	Elisha was still at Jericho when they returned. “Didn’t I tell you not to go?” he asked.
2KI.2.19	One day the leaders of the town of Jericho visited Elisha. “We have a problem, my lord,” they told him. “This town is located in pleasant surroundings, as you can see. But the water is bad, and the land is unproductive.”
2KI.2.20	Elisha said, “Bring me a new bowl with salt in it.” So they brought it to him. 
2KI.2.21	Then he went out to the spring that supplied the town with water and threw the salt into it. And he said, “This is what the 
2KI.2.22	And the water has remained pure ever since, just as Elisha said.
2KI.2.23	Elisha left Jericho and went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, a group of boys from the town began mocking and making fun of him. “Go away, baldy!” they chanted. “Go away, baldy!” 
2KI.2.24	Elisha turned around and looked at them, and he cursed them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel and finally returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Ahab’s son Joram
2KI.3.2	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless, he continued in the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had committed and led the people of Israel to commit.
2KI.3.4	King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder. He used to pay the king of Israel an annual tribute of 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams. 
2KI.3.5	But after Ahab’s death, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	So King Joram promptly mustered the army of Israel and marched from Samaria. 
2KI.3.7	On the way, he sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you join me in battle against him?”
2KI.3.7	And Jehoshaphat replied, “Why, of course! You and I are as one. My troops are your troops, and my horses are your horses.” 
2KI.3.8	Then Jehoshaphat asked, “What route will we take?”
2KI.3.8	“We will attack from the wilderness of Edom,” Joram replied.
2KI.3.9	The king of Edom and his troops joined them, and all three armies traveled along a roundabout route through the wilderness for seven days. But there was no water for the men or their animals.
2KI.3.10	“What should we do?” the king of Israel cried out. “The 
2KI.3.11	But King Jehoshaphat of Judah asked, “Is there no prophet of the 
2KI.3.11	One of King Joram’s officers replied, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to be Elijah’s personal assistant.
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat said, “Yes, the 
2KI.3.13	“Why are you coming to me?”
2KI.3.13	But King Joram of Israel said, “No! For it was the 
2KI.3.14	Elisha replied, “As surely as the 
2KI.3.15	Now bring me someone who can play the harp.”
2KI.3.15	While the harp was being played, the power
2KI.3.16	and he said, “This is what the 
2KI.3.17	You will see neither wind nor rain, says the 
2KI.3.18	But this is only a simple thing for the 
2KI.3.19	You will conquer the best of their towns, even the fortified ones. You will cut down all their good trees, stop up all their springs, and ruin all their good land with stones.”
2KI.3.20	The next day at about the time when the morning sacrifice was offered, water suddenly appeared! It was flowing from the direction of Edom, and soon there was water everywhere.
2KI.3.21	Meanwhile, when the people of Moab heard about the three armies marching against them, they mobilized every man who was old enough to strap on a sword, and they stationed themselves along their border. 
2KI.3.22	But when they got up the next morning, the sun was shining across the water, making it appear red to the Moabites—like blood. 
2KI.3.23	“It’s blood!” the Moabites exclaimed. “The three armies must have attacked and killed each other! Let’s go, men of Moab, and collect the plunder!”
2KI.3.24	But when the Moabites arrived at the Israelite camp, the army of Israel rushed out and attacked them until they turned and ran. The army of Israel chased them into the land of Moab, destroying everything as they went.
2KI.3.25	They destroyed the towns, covered their good land with stones, stopped up all the springs, and cut down all the good trees. Finally, only Kir-hareseth and its stone walls were left, but men with slings surrounded and attacked it.
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab saw that he was losing the battle, he led 700 of his swordsmen in a desperate attempt to break through the enemy lines near the king of Edom, but they failed. 
2KI.3.27	Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would have been the next king, and sacrificed him as a burnt offering on the wall. So there was great anger against Israel,
2KI.4.1	One day the widow of a member of the group of prophets came to Elisha and cried out, “My husband who served you is dead, and you know how he feared the 
2KI.4.2	“What can I do to help you?” Elisha asked. “Tell me, what do you have in the house?”
2KI.4.2	“Nothing at all, except a flask of olive oil,” she replied.
2KI.4.3	And Elisha said, “Borrow as many empty jars as you can from your friends and neighbors. 
2KI.4.4	Then go into your house with your sons and shut the door behind you. Pour olive oil from your flask into the jars, setting each one aside when it is filled.”
2KI.4.5	So she did as she was told. Her sons kept bringing jars to her, and she filled one after another. 
2KI.4.6	Soon every container was full to the brim!
2KI.4.6	“Bring me another jar,” she said to one of her sons.
2KI.4.6	“There aren’t any more!” he told her. And then the olive oil stopped flowing.
2KI.4.7	When she told the man of God what had happened, he said to her, “Now sell the olive oil and pay your debts, and you and your sons can live on what is left over.”
2KI.4.8	One day Elisha went to the town of Shunem. A wealthy woman lived there, and she urged him to come to her home for a meal. After that, whenever he passed that way, he would stop there for something to eat.
2KI.4.9	She said to her husband, “I am sure this man who stops in from time to time is a holy man of God. 
2KI.4.10	Let’s build a small room for him on the roof and furnish it with a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp. Then he will have a place to stay whenever he comes by.”
2KI.4.11	One day Elisha returned to Shunem, and he went up to this upper room to rest. 
2KI.4.12	He said to his servant Gehazi, “Tell the woman from Shunem I want to speak to her.” When she appeared, 
2KI.4.13	Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tell her, ‘We appreciate the kind concern you have shown us. What can we do for you? Can we put in a good word for you to the king or to the commander of the army?’”
2KI.4.13	“No,” she replied, “my family takes good care of me.”
2KI.4.14	Later Elisha asked Gehazi, “What can we do for her?”
2KI.4.14	Gehazi replied, “She doesn’t have a son, and her husband is an old man.”
2KI.4.15	“Call her back again,” Elisha told him. When the woman returned, Elisha said to her as she stood in the doorway, 
2KI.4.16	“Next year at this time you will be holding a son in your arms!”
2KI.4.16	“No, my lord!” she cried. “O man of God, don’t deceive me and get my hopes up like that.”
2KI.4.17	But sure enough, the woman soon became pregnant. And at that time the following year she had a son, just as Elisha had said.
2KI.4.18	One day when her child was older, he went out to help his father, who was working with the harvesters. 
2KI.4.19	Suddenly he cried out, “My head hurts! My head hurts!”
2KI.4.19	His father said to one of the servants, “Carry him home to his mother.”
2KI.4.20	So the servant took him home, and his mother held him on her lap. But around noontime he died. 
2KI.4.21	She carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and left him there. 
2KI.4.22	She sent a message to her husband: “Send one of the servants and a donkey so that I can hurry to the man of God and come right back.”
2KI.4.23	“Why go today?” he asked. “It is neither a new moon festival nor a Sabbath.”
2KI.4.23	But she said, “It will be all right.”
2KI.4.24	So she saddled the donkey and said to the servant, “Hurry! Don’t slow down unless I tell you to.”
2KI.4.25	As she approached the man of God at Mount Carmel, Elisha saw her in the distance. He said to Gehazi, “Look, the woman from Shunem is coming. 
2KI.4.26	Run out to meet her and ask her, ‘Is everything all right with you, your husband, and your child?’”
2KI.4.26	“Yes,” the woman told Gehazi, “everything is fine.”
2KI.4.27	But when she came to the man of God at the mountain, she fell to the ground before him and caught hold of his feet. Gehazi began to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone. She is deeply troubled, but the 
2KI.4.28	Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? And didn’t I say, ‘Don’t deceive me and get my hopes up’?”
2KI.4.29	Then Elisha said to Gehazi, “Get ready to travel
2KI.4.30	But the boy’s mother said, “As surely as the 
2KI.4.31	Gehazi hurried on ahead and laid the staff on the child’s face, but nothing happened. There was no sign of life. He returned to meet Elisha and told him, “The child is still dead.”
2KI.4.32	When Elisha arrived, the child was indeed dead, lying there on the prophet’s bed. 
2KI.4.33	He went in alone and shut the door behind him and prayed to the 
2KI.4.34	Then he lay down on the child’s body, placing his mouth on the child’s mouth, his eyes on the child’s eyes, and his hands on the child’s hands. And as he stretched out on him, the child’s body began to grow warm again! 
2KI.4.35	Elisha got up, walked back and forth across the room once, and then stretched himself out again on the child. This time the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes!
2KI.4.36	Then Elisha summoned Gehazi. “Call the child’s mother!” he said. And when she came in, Elisha said, “Here, take your son!” 
2KI.4.37	She fell at his feet and bowed before him, overwhelmed with gratitude. Then she took her son in her arms and carried him downstairs.
2KI.4.38	Elisha now returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. One day as the group of prophets was seated before him, he said to his servant, “Put a large pot on the fire, and make some stew for the rest of the group.”
2KI.4.39	One of the young men went out into the field to gather herbs and came back with a pocketful of wild gourds. He shredded them and put them into the pot without realizing they were poisonous. 
2KI.4.40	Some of the stew was served to the men. But after they had eaten a bite or two they cried out, “Man of God, there’s poison in this stew!” So they would not eat it.
2KI.4.41	Elisha said, “Bring me some flour.” Then he threw it into the pot and said, “Now it’s all right; go ahead and eat.” And then it did not harm them.
2KI.4.42	One day a man from Baal-shalishah brought the man of God a sack of fresh grain and twenty loaves of barley bread made from the first grain of his harvest. Elisha said, “Give it to the people so they can eat.”
2KI.4.43	“What?” his servant exclaimed. “Feed a hundred people with only this?”
2KI.4.43	But Elisha repeated, “Give it to the people so they can eat, for this is what the 
2KI.4.44	And when they gave it to the people, there was plenty for all and some left over, just as the 
2KI.5.1	The king of Aram had great admiration for Naaman, the commander of his army, because through him the 
2KI.5.2	At this time Aramean raiders had invaded the land of Israel, and among their captives was a young girl who had been given to Naaman’s wife as a maid. 
2KI.5.3	One day the girl said to her mistress, “I wish my master would go to see the prophet in Samaria. He would heal him of his leprosy.”
2KI.5.4	So Naaman told the king what the young girl from Israel had said. 
2KI.5.5	“Go and visit the prophet,” the king of Aram told him. “I will send a letter of introduction for you to take to the king of Israel.” So Naaman started out, carrying as gifts 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold,
2KI.5.6	The letter to the king of Israel said: “With this letter I present my servant Naaman. I want you to heal him of his leprosy.”
2KI.5.7	When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in dismay and said, “Am I God, that I can give life and take it away? Why is this man asking me to heal someone with leprosy? I can see that he’s just trying to pick a fight with me.”
2KI.5.8	But when Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes in dismay, he sent this message to him: “Why are you so upset? Send Naaman to me, and he will learn that there is a true prophet here in Israel.”
2KI.5.9	So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and waited at the door of Elisha’s house. 
2KI.5.10	But Elisha sent a messenger out to him with this message: “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan River. Then your skin will be restored, and you will be healed of your leprosy.”
2KI.5.11	But Naaman became angry and stalked away. “I thought he would certainly come out to meet me!” he said. “I expected him to wave his hand over the leprosy and call on the name of the 
2KI.5.12	Aren’t the rivers of Damascus, the Abana and the Pharpar, better than any of the rivers of Israel? Why shouldn’t I wash in them and be healed?” So Naaman turned and went away in a rage.
2KI.5.13	But his officers tried to reason with him and said, “Sir,
2KI.5.14	So Naaman went down to the Jordan River and dipped himself seven times, as the man of God had instructed him. And his skin became as healthy as the skin of a young child, and he was healed!
2KI.5.15	Then Naaman and his entire party went back to find the man of God. They stood before him, and Naaman said, “Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.”
2KI.5.16	But Elisha replied, “As surely as the 
2KI.5.17	Then Naaman said, “All right, but please allow me to load two of my mules with earth from this place, and I will take it back home with me. From now on I will never again offer burnt offerings or sacrifices to any other god except the 
2KI.5.18	However, may the 
2KI.5.19	“Go in peace,” Elisha said. So Naaman started home again.
2KI.5.20	But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said to himself, “My master should not have let this Aramean get away without accepting any of his gifts. As surely as the 
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi set off after Naaman.
2KI.5.21	When Naaman saw Gehazi running after him, he climbed down from his chariot and went to meet him. “Is everything all right?” Naaman asked.
2KI.5.22	“Yes,” Gehazi said, “but my master has sent me to tell you that two young prophets from the hill country of Ephraim have just arrived. He would like 75 pounds
2KI.5.23	“By all means, take twice as much
2KI.5.24	But when they arrived at the citadel,
2KI.5.25	When he went in to his master, Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?”
2KI.5.25	“I haven’t been anywhere,” he replied.
2KI.5.26	But Elisha asked him, “Don’t you realize that I was there in spirit when Naaman stepped down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to receive money and clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and cattle, and male and female servants? 
2KI.5.27	Because you have done this, you and your descendants will suffer from Naaman’s leprosy forever.” When Gehazi left the room, he was covered with leprosy; his skin was white as snow.
2KI.6.1	One day the group of prophets came to Elisha and told him, “As you can see, this place where we meet with you is too small. 
2KI.6.2	Let’s go down to the Jordan River, where there are plenty of logs. There we can build a new place for us to meet.”
2KI.6.2	“All right,” he told them, “go ahead.”
2KI.6.3	“Please come with us,” someone suggested.
2KI.6.3	“I will,” he said. 
2KI.6.4	So he went with them.
2KI.6.4	When they arrived at the Jordan, they began cutting down trees. 
2KI.6.5	But as one of them was cutting a tree, his ax head fell into the river. “Oh, sir!” he cried. “It was a borrowed ax!”
2KI.6.6	“Where did it fall?” the man of God asked. When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot. Then the ax head floated to the surface. 
2KI.6.7	“Grab it,” Elisha said. And the man reached out and grabbed it.
2KI.6.8	When the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he would confer with his officers and say, “We will mobilize our forces at such and such a place.”
2KI.6.9	But immediately Elisha, the man of God, would warn the king of Israel, “Do not go near that place, for the Arameans are planning to mobilize their troops there.” 
2KI.6.10	So the king of Israel would send word to the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he would be on the alert there.
2KI.6.11	The king of Aram became very upset over this. He called his officers together and demanded, “Which of you is the traitor? Who has been informing the king of Israel of my plans?”
2KI.6.12	“It’s not us, my lord the king,” one of the officers replied. “Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in the privacy of your bedroom!”
2KI.6.13	“Go and find out where he is,” the king commanded, “so I can send troops to seize him.”
2KI.6.13	And the report came back: “Elisha is at Dothan.” 
2KI.6.14	So one night the king of Aram sent a great army with many chariots and horses to surround the city.
2KI.6.15	When the servant of the man of God got up early the next morning and went outside, there were troops, horses, and chariots everywhere. “Oh, sir, what will we do now?” the young man cried to Elisha.
2KI.6.16	“Don’t be afraid!” Elisha told him. “For there are more on our side than on theirs!” 
2KI.6.17	Then Elisha prayed, “O 
2KI.6.18	As the Aramean army advanced toward him, Elisha prayed, “O 
2KI.6.19	Then Elisha went out and told them, “You have come the wrong way! This isn’t the right city! Follow me, and I will take you to the man you are looking for.” And he led them to the city of Samaria.
2KI.6.20	As soon as they had entered Samaria, Elisha prayed, “O 
2KI.6.21	When the king of Israel saw them, he shouted to Elisha, “My father, should I kill them? Should I kill them?”
2KI.6.22	“Of course not!” Elisha replied. “Do we kill prisoners of war? Give them food and drink and send them home again to their master.”
2KI.6.23	So the king made a great feast for them and then sent them home to their master. After that, the Aramean raiders stayed away from the land of Israel.
2KI.6.24	Some time later, however, King Ben-hadad of Aram mustered his entire army and besieged Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	As a result, there was a great famine in the city. The siege lasted so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty pieces of silver, and a cup of dove’s dung sold for five pieces
2KI.6.26	One day as the king of Israel was walking along the wall of the city, a woman called to him, “Please help me, my lord the king!”
2KI.6.27	He answered, “If the 
2KI.6.28	But then the king asked, “What is the matter?”
2KI.6.28	She replied, “This woman said to me: ‘Come on, let’s eat your son today, then we will eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	So we cooked my son and ate him. Then the next day I said to her, ‘Kill your son so we can eat him,’ but she has hidden her son.”
2KI.6.30	When the king heard this, he tore his clothes in despair. And as the king walked along the wall, the people could see that he was wearing burlap under his robe next to his skin. 
2KI.6.31	“May God strike me and even kill me if I don’t separate Elisha’s head from his shoulders this very day,” the king vowed.
2KI.6.32	Elisha was sitting in his house with the elders of Israel when the king sent a messenger to summon him. But before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “A murderer has sent a man to cut off my head. When he arrives, shut the door and keep him out. We will soon hear his master’s steps following him.”
2KI.6.33	While Elisha was still saying this, the messenger arrived. And the king
2KI.7.1	Elisha replied, “Listen to this message from the 
2KI.7.2	The officer assisting the king said to the man of God, “That couldn’t happen even if the 
2KI.7.2	But Elisha replied, “You will see it happen with your own eyes, but you won’t be able to eat any of it!”
2KI.7.3	Now there were four men with leprosy
2KI.7.4	“We will starve if we stay here, but with the famine in the city, we will starve if we go back there. So we might as well go out and surrender to the Aramean army. If they let us live, so much the better. But if they kill us, we would have died anyway.”
2KI.7.5	So at twilight they set out for the camp of the Arameans. But when they came to the edge of the camp, no one was there! 
2KI.7.6	For the Lord had caused the Aramean army to hear the clatter of speeding chariots and the galloping of horses and the sounds of a great army approaching. “The king of Israel has hired the Hittites and Egyptians
2KI.7.7	So they panicked and ran into the night, abandoning their tents, horses, donkeys, and everything else, as they fled for their lives.
2KI.7.8	When the men with leprosy arrived at the edge of the camp, they went into one tent after another, eating and drinking wine; and they carried off silver and gold and clothing and hid it. 
2KI.7.9	Finally, they said to each other, “This is not right. This is a day of good news, and we aren’t sharing it with anyone! If we wait until morning, some calamity will certainly fall upon us. Come on, let’s go back and tell the people at the palace.”
2KI.7.10	So they went back to the city and told the gatekeepers what had happened. “We went out to the Aramean camp,” they said, “and no one was there! The horses and donkeys were tethered and the tents were all in order, but there wasn’t a single person around!” 
2KI.7.11	Then the gatekeepers shouted the news to the people in the palace.
2KI.7.12	The king got out of bed in the middle of the night and told his officers, “I know what has happened. The Arameans know we are starving, so they have left their camp and have hidden in the fields. They are expecting us to leave the city, and then they will take us alive and capture the city.”
2KI.7.13	One of his officers replied, “We had better send out scouts to check into this. Let them take five of the remaining horses. If something happens to them, it will be no worse than if they stay here and die with the rest of us.”
2KI.7.14	So two chariots with horses were prepared, and the king sent scouts to see what had happened to the Aramean army. 
2KI.7.15	They went all the way to the Jordan River, following a trail of clothing and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their mad rush to escape. The scouts returned and told the king about it. 
2KI.7.16	Then the people of Samaria rushed out and plundered the Aramean camp. So it was true that six quarts of choice flour were sold that day for one piece of silver, and twelve quarts of barley grain were sold for one piece of silver, just as the 
2KI.7.17	The king appointed his officer to control the traffic at the gate, but he was knocked down and trampled to death as the people rushed out.
2KI.7.17	So everything happened exactly as the man of God had predicted when the king came to his house. 
2KI.7.18	The man of God had said to the king, “By this time tomorrow in the markets of Samaria, six quarts of choice flour will cost one piece of silver, and twelve quarts of barley grain will cost one piece of silver.”
2KI.7.19	The king’s officer had replied, “That couldn’t happen even if the 
2KI.7.20	And so it was, for the people trampled him to death at the gate!
2KI.8.1	Elisha had told the woman whose son he had brought back to life, “Take your family and move to some other place, for the 
2KI.8.2	So the woman did as the man of God instructed. She took her family and settled in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
2KI.8.3	After the famine ended she returned from the land of the Philistines, and she went to see the king about getting back her house and land. 
2KI.8.4	As she came in, the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God. The king had just said, “Tell me some stories about the great things Elisha has done.” 
2KI.8.5	And Gehazi was telling the king about the time Elisha had brought a boy back to life. At that very moment, the mother of the boy walked in to make her appeal to the king about her house and land.
2KI.8.5	“Look, my lord the king!” Gehazi exclaimed. “Here is the woman now, and this is her son—the very one Elisha brought back to life!”
2KI.8.6	“Is this true?” the king asked her. And she told him the story. So he directed one of his officials to see that everything she had lost was restored to her, including the value of any crops that had been harvested during her absence.
2KI.8.7	Elisha went to Damascus, the capital of Aram, where King Ben-hadad lay sick. When someone told the king that the man of God had come, 
2KI.8.8	the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift to the man of God. Then tell him to ask the 
2KI.8.9	So Hazael loaded down forty camels with the finest products of Damascus as a gift for Elisha. He went to him and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad, the king of Aram, has sent me to ask, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’”
2KI.8.10	And Elisha replied, “Go and tell him, ‘You will surely recover.’ But actually the 
2KI.8.11	Elisha stared at Hazael
2KI.8.12	“What’s the matter, my lord?” Hazael asked him.
2KI.8.12	Elisha replied, “I know the terrible things you will do to the people of Israel. You will burn their fortified cities, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women!”
2KI.8.13	Hazael responded, “How could a nobody like me
2KI.8.13	Elisha answered, “The 
2KI.8.14	When Hazael left Elisha and went back, the king asked him, “What did Elisha tell you?”
2KI.8.14	And Hazael replied, “He told me that you will surely recover.”
2KI.8.15	But the next day Hazael took a blanket, soaked it in water, and held it over the king’s face until he died. Then Hazael became the next king of Aram.
2KI.8.16	Jehoram son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah began to rule over Judah in the fifth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel. 
2KI.8.17	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. 
2KI.8.18	But Jehoram followed the example of the kings of Israel and was as wicked as King Ahab, for he had married one of Ahab’s daughters. So Jehoram did what was evil in the 
2KI.8.19	But the 
2KI.8.20	During Jehoram’s reign, the Edomites revolted against Judah and crowned their own king. 
2KI.8.21	So Jehoram
2KI.8.22	So Edom has been independent from Judah to this day. The town of Libnah also revolted about that same time.
2KI.8.23	The rest of the events in Jehoram’s reign and everything he did are recorded in 
2KI.8.24	When Jehoram died, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Ahaziah became the next king.
2KI.8.25	Ahaziah son of Jehoram began to rule over Judah in the twelfth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel.
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	Ahaziah followed the evil example of King Ahab’s family. He did what was evil in the 
2KI.8.28	Ahaziah joined Joram son of Ahab in his war against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. When the Arameans wounded King Joram in the battle, 
2KI.8.29	he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had received at Ramoth.
2KI.9.1	Meanwhile, Elisha the prophet had summoned a member of the group of prophets. “Get ready to travel,”
2KI.9.2	and find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi. Call him into a private room away from his friends, 
2KI.9.3	and pour the oil over his head. Say to him, ‘This is what the 
2KI.9.4	So the young prophet did as he was told and went to Ramoth-gilead. 
2KI.9.5	When he arrived there, he found Jehu sitting around with the other army officers. “I have a message for you, Commander,” he said.
2KI.9.5	“For which one of us?” Jehu asked.
2KI.9.5	“For you, Commander,” he replied.
2KI.9.6	So Jehu left the others and went into the house. Then the young prophet poured the oil over Jehu’s head and said, “This is what the 
2KI.9.7	You are to destroy the family of Ahab, your master. In this way, I will avenge the murder of my prophets and all the 
2KI.9.8	The entire family of Ahab must be wiped out. I will destroy every one of his male descendants, slave and free alike, anywhere in Israel. 
2KI.9.9	I will destroy the family of Ahab as I destroyed the families of Jeroboam son of Nebat and of Baasha son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	Dogs will eat Ahab’s wife Jezebel at the plot of land in Jezreel, and no one will bury her.” Then the young prophet opened the door and ran.
2KI.9.11	Jehu went back to his fellow officers, and one of them asked him, “What did that madman want? Is everything all right?”
2KI.9.11	“You know how a man like that babbles on,” Jehu replied.
2KI.9.12	“You’re hiding something,” they said. “Tell us.”
2KI.9.12	So Jehu told them, “He said to me, ‘This is what the 
2KI.9.13	Then they quickly spread out their cloaks on the bare steps and blew the ram’s horn, shouting, “Jehu is king!”
2KI.9.14	So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, led a conspiracy against King Joram. (Now Joram had been with the army at Ramoth-gilead, defending Israel against the forces of King Hazael of Aram. 
2KI.9.15	But King Joram
2KI.9.16	Then Jehu got into a chariot and rode to Jezreel to find King Joram, who was lying there wounded. King Ahaziah of Judah was there, too, for he had gone to visit him. 
2KI.9.17	The watchman on the tower of Jezreel saw Jehu and his company approaching, so he shouted to Joram, “I see a company of troops coming!”
2KI.9.17	“Send out a rider to ask if they are coming in peace,” King Joram ordered.
2KI.9.18	So a horseman went out to meet Jehu and said, “The king wants to know if you are coming in peace.”
2KI.9.18	Jehu replied, “What do you know about peace? Fall in behind me!”
2KI.9.18	The watchman called out to the king, “The messenger has met them, but he’s not returning.”
2KI.9.19	So the king sent out a second horseman. He rode up to them and said, “The king wants to know if you come in peace.”
2KI.9.19	Again Jehu answered, “What do you know about peace? Fall in behind me!”
2KI.9.20	The watchman exclaimed, “The messenger has met them, but he isn’t returning either! It must be Jehu son of Nimshi, for he’s driving like a madman.”
2KI.9.21	“Quick! Get my chariot ready!” King Joram commanded.
2KI.9.21	Then King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah rode out in their chariots to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of land that had belonged to Naboth of Jezreel. 
2KI.9.22	King Joram demanded, “Do you come in peace, Jehu?”
2KI.9.22	Jehu replied, “How can there be peace as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother, Jezebel, are all around us?”
2KI.9.23	Then King Joram turned the horses around
2KI.9.24	But Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he sank down dead in his chariot.
2KI.9.25	Jehu said to Bidkar, his officer, “Throw him into the plot of land that belonged to Naboth of Jezreel. Do you remember when you and I were riding along behind his father, Ahab? The 
2KI.9.26	‘I solemnly swear that I will repay him here on this plot of land, says the 
2KI.9.27	When King Ahaziah of Judah saw what was happening, he fled along the road to Beth-haggan. Jehu rode after him, shouting, “Shoot him, too!” So they shot Ahaziah
2KI.9.28	His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem, where they buried him with his ancestors in the City of David. 
2KI.9.29	Ahaziah had become king over Judah in the eleventh year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab.
2KI.9.30	When Jezebel, the queen mother, heard that Jehu had come to Jezreel, she painted her eyelids and fixed her hair and sat at a window. 
2KI.9.31	When Jehu entered the gate of the palace, she shouted at him, “Have you come in peace, you murderer? You’re just like Zimri, who murdered his master!”
2KI.9.32	Jehu looked up and saw her at the window and shouted, “Who is on my side?” And two or three eunuchs looked out at him. 
2KI.9.33	“Throw her down!” Jehu yelled. So they threw her out the window, and her blood spattered against the wall and on the horses. And Jehu trampled her body under his horses’ hooves.
2KI.9.34	Then Jehu went into the palace and ate and drank. Afterward he said, “Someone go and bury this cursed woman, for she is the daughter of a king.” 
2KI.9.35	But when they went out to bury her, they found only her skull, her feet, and her hands.
2KI.9.36	When they returned and told Jehu, he stated, “This fulfills the message from the 
2KI.9.37	Her remains will be scattered like dung on the plot of land in Jezreel, so that no one will be able to recognize her.’”
2KI.10.1	Ahab had seventy sons living in the city of Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the elders and officials of the city,
2KI.10.2	“The king’s sons are with you, and you have at your disposal chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weapons. As soon as you receive this letter, 
2KI.10.3	select the best qualified of your master’s sons to be your king, and prepare to fight for Ahab’s dynasty.”
2KI.10.4	But they were paralyzed with fear and said, “We’ve seen that two kings couldn’t stand against this man! What can we do?”
2KI.10.5	So the palace and city administrators, together with the elders and the guardians of the king’s sons, sent this message to Jehu: “We are your servants and will do anything you tell us. We will not make anyone king; do whatever you think is best.”
2KI.10.6	Jehu responded with a second letter: “If you are on my side and are going to obey me, bring the heads of your master’s sons to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” Now the seventy sons of the king were being cared for by the leaders of Samaria, where they had been raised since childhood. 
2KI.10.7	When the letter arrived, the leaders killed all seventy of the king’s sons. They placed their heads in baskets and presented them to Jehu at Jezreel.
2KI.10.8	A messenger went to Jehu and said, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”
2KI.10.8	So Jehu ordered, “Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate, and leave them there until morning.”
2KI.10.9	In the morning he went out and spoke to the crowd that had gathered around them. “You are not to blame,” he told them. “I am the one who conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all these? 
2KI.10.10	You can be sure that the message of the 
2KI.10.11	Then Jehu killed all who were left of Ahab’s relatives living in Jezreel and all his important officials, his personal friends, and his priests. So Ahab was left without a single survivor.
2KI.10.12	Then Jehu set out for Samaria. Along the way, while he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds, 
2KI.10.13	he met some relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah. “Who are you?” he asked them.
2KI.10.13	And they replied, “We are relatives of King Ahaziah. We are going to visit the sons of King Ahab and the sons of the queen mother.”
2KI.10.14	“Take them alive!” Jehu shouted to his men. And they captured all forty-two of them and killed them at the well of Beth-eked. None of them escaped.
2KI.10.15	When Jehu left there, he met Jehonadab son of Recab, who was coming to meet him. After they had greeted each other, Jehu said to him, “Are you as loyal to me as I am to you?”
2KI.10.15	“Yes, I am,” Jehonadab replied.
2KI.10.15	“If you are,” Jehu said, “then give me your hand.” So Jehonadab put out his hand, and Jehu helped him into the chariot. 
2KI.10.16	Then Jehu said, “Now come with me, and see how devoted I am to the 
2KI.10.17	When Jehu arrived in Samaria, he killed everyone who was left there from Ahab’s family, just as the 
2KI.10.18	Then Jehu called a meeting of all the people of the city and said to them, “Ahab’s worship of Baal was nothing compared to the way I will worship him! 
2KI.10.19	Therefore, summon all the prophets and worshipers of Baal, and call together all his priests. See to it that every one of them comes, for I am going to offer a great sacrifice to Baal. Anyone who fails to come will be put to death.” But Jehu’s cunning plan was to destroy all the worshipers of Baal.
2KI.10.20	Then Jehu ordered, “Prepare a solemn assembly to worship Baal!” So they did. 
2KI.10.21	He sent messengers throughout all Israel summoning those who worshiped Baal. They all came—not a single one remained behind—and they filled the temple of Baal from one end to the other. 
2KI.10.22	And Jehu instructed the keeper of the wardrobe, “Be sure that every worshiper of Baal wears one of these robes.” So robes were given to them.
2KI.10.23	Then Jehu went into the temple of Baal with Jehonadab son of Recab. Jehu said to the worshipers of Baal, “Make sure no one who worships the 
2KI.10.24	So they were all inside the temple to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty of his men outside the building and had warned them, “If you let anyone escape, you will pay for it with your own life.”
2KI.10.25	As soon as Jehu had finished sacrificing the burnt offering, he commanded his guards and officers, “Go in and kill all of them. Don’t let a single one escape!” So they killed them all with their swords, and the guards and officers dragged their bodies outside.
2KI.10.26	They dragged out the sacred pillar
2KI.10.27	They smashed the sacred pillar and wrecked the temple of Baal, converting it into a public toilet, as it remains to this day.
2KI.10.28	In this way, Jehu destroyed every trace of Baal worship from Israel. 
2KI.10.29	He did not, however, destroy the gold calves at Bethel and Dan, with which Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to sin.
2KI.10.30	Nonetheless the 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu did not obey the Law of the 
2KI.10.32	At about that time the 
2KI.10.33	east of the Jordan River, including all of Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh. He conquered the area from the town of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge to as far north as Gilead and Bashan.
2KI.10.34	The rest of the events in Jehu’s reign—everything he did and all his achievements—are recorded in 
2KI.10.35	When Jehu died, he was buried in Samaria. Then his son Jehoahaz became the next king. 
2KI.10.36	In all, Jehu reigned over Israel from Samaria for twenty-eight years.
2KI.11.1	When Athaliah, the mother of King Ahaziah of Judah, learned that her son was dead, she began to destroy the rest of the royal family. 
2KI.11.2	But Ahaziah’s sister Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram,
2KI.11.3	Joash remained hidden in the Temple of the 
2KI.11.4	In the seventh year of Athaliah’s reign, Jehoiada the priest summoned the commanders, the Carite mercenaries, and the palace guards to come to the Temple of the 
2KI.11.5	Jehoiada told them, “This is what you must do. A third of you who are on duty on the Sabbath are to guard the royal palace itself. 
2KI.11.6	Another third of you are to stand guard at the Sur Gate. And the final third must stand guard behind the palace guard. These three groups will all guard the palace. 
2KI.11.7	The other two units who are off duty on the Sabbath must stand guard for the king at the 
2KI.11.8	Form a bodyguard around the king and keep your weapons in hand. Kill anyone who tries to break through. Stay with the king wherever he goes.”
2KI.11.9	So the commanders did everything as Jehoiada the priest ordered. The commanders took charge of the men reporting for duty that Sabbath, as well as those who were going off duty. They brought them all to Jehoiada the priest, 
2KI.11.10	and he supplied them with the spears and small shields that had once belonged to King David and were stored in the Temple of the 
2KI.11.11	The palace guards stationed themselves around the king, with their weapons ready. They formed a line from the south side of the Temple around to the north side and all around the altar.
2KI.11.12	Then Jehoiada brought out Joash, the king’s son, placed the crown on his head, and presented him with a copy of God’s laws.

2KI.17.25	But since these foreign settlers did not worship the 
2KI.17.26	So a message was sent to the king of Assyria: “The people you have sent to live in the towns of Samaria do not know the religious customs of the God of the land. He has sent lions among them to destroy them because they have not worshiped him correctly.”
2KI.17.27	The king of Assyria then commanded, “Send one of the exiled priests back to Samaria. Let him live there and teach the new residents the religious customs of the God of the land.” 
2KI.17.28	So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria returned to Bethel and taught the new residents how to worship the

2KI.18.14	King Hezekiah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish: “I have done wrong. I will pay whatever tribute money you demand if you will only withdraw.” The king of Assyria then demanded a settlement of more than eleven tons of silver and one ton of gold.

2KI.18.19	“This is what the great king of Assyria says: What are you trusting in that makes you so confident? 
2KI.18.20	Do you think that mere words can substitute for military skill and strength? Who are you counting on, that you have rebelled against me? 
2KI.18.21	On Egypt? If you lean on Egypt, it will be like a reed that splinters beneath your weight and pierces your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is completely unreliable!
2KI.18.22	“But perhaps you will say to me, ‘We are trusting in the 
2KI.18.23	“I’ll tell you what! Strike a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you 2,000 horses if you can find that many men to ride on them! 
2KI.18.24	With your tiny army, how can you think of challenging even the weakest contingent of my master’s troops, even with the help of Egypt’s chariots and charioteers? 
2KI.18.25	What’s more, do you think we have invaded your land without the 
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the Assyrian chief of staff, “Please speak to us in Aramaic, for we understand it well. Don’t speak in Hebrew,
2KI.18.27	But Sennacherib’s chief of staff replied, “Do you think my master sent this message only to you and your master? He wants all the people to hear it, for when we put this city under siege, they will suffer along with you. They will be so hungry and thirsty that they will eat their own dung and drink their own urine.”
2KI.18.28	Then the chief of staff stood and shouted in Hebrew to the people on the wall, “Listen to this message from the great king of Assyria! 
2KI.18.29	This is what the king says: Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you. He will never be able to rescue you from my power. 
2KI.18.30	Don’t let him fool you into trusting in the 
2KI.18.31	“Don’t listen to Hezekiah! These are the terms the king of Assyria is offering: Make peace with me—open the gates and come out. Then each of you can continue eating from your own grapevine and fig tree and drinking from your own well. 
2KI.18.32	Then I will arrange to take you to another land like this one—a land of grain and new wine, bread and vineyards, olive groves and honey. Choose life instead of death!
2KI.18.32	“Don’t listen to Hezekiah when he tries to mislead you by saying, ‘The 
2KI.18.33	Have the gods of any other nations ever saved their people from the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? And what about the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Did any god rescue Samaria from my power? 
2KI.18.35	What god of any nation has ever been able to save its people from my power? So what makes you think that the 
2KI.18.36	But the people were silent and did not utter a word because Hezekiah had commanded them, “Do not answer him.”
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian, went back to Hezekiah. They tore their clothes in despair, and they went in to see the king and told him what the Assyrian chief of staff had said.
2KI.19.1	When King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes and put on burlap and went into the Temple of the 
2KI.19.2	And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the court secretary, and the leading priests, all dressed in burlap, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
2KI.19.3	They told him, “This is what King Hezekiah says: Today is a day of trouble, insults, and disgrace. It is like when a child is ready to be born, but the mother has no strength to deliver the baby. 
2KI.19.4	But perhaps the 
2KI.19.5	After King Hezekiah’s officials delivered the king’s message to Isaiah, 
2KI.19.6	the prophet replied, “Say to your master, ‘This is what the 
2KI.19.7	Listen! I myself will move against him,
2KI.19.8	Meanwhile, the Assyrian chief of staff left Jerusalem and went to consult the king of Assyria, who had left Lachish and was attacking Libnah.
2KI.19.9	Soon afterward King Sennacherib received word that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia
2KI.19.10	“This message is for King Hezekiah of Judah. Don’t let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you with promises that Jerusalem will not be captured by the king of Assyria. 
2KI.19.11	You know perfectly well what the kings of Assyria have done wherever they have gone. They have completely destroyed everyone who stood in their way! Why should you be any different? 
2KI.19.12	Have the gods of other nations rescued them—such nations as Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar? My predecessors destroyed them all! 
2KI.19.13	What happened to the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad? What happened to the kings of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?”
2KI.19.14	After Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he went up to the 
2KI.19.15	And Hezekiah prayed this prayer before the 
2KI.19.16	Bend down, O 
2KI.19.17	“It is true, 
2KI.19.18	And they have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire and burned them. But of course the Assyrians could destroy them! They were not gods at all—only idols of wood and stone shaped by human hands. 
2KI.19.19	Now, O 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “This is what the 
2KI.19.21	And the 
2KI.19.21	“The virgin daughter of Zion
2KI.19.21	despises you and laughs at you.
2KI.19.21	The daughter of Jerusalem
2KI.19.21	shakes her head in derision as you flee.
2KI.19.22	“Whom have you been defying and ridiculing?
2KI.19.22	Against whom did you raise your voice?
2KI.19.22	At whom did you look with such haughty eyes?
2KI.19.22	It was the Holy One of Israel!
2KI.19.23	By your messengers you have defied the Lord.
2KI.19.23	You have said, ‘With my many chariots
2KI.19.23	I have conquered the highest mountains—
2KI.19.23	yes, the remotest peaks of Lebanon.
2KI.19.23	I have cut down its tallest cedars
2KI.19.23	and its finest cypress trees.
2KI.19.23	I have reached its farthest corners
2KI.19.23	and explored its deepest forests.
2KI.19.24	I have dug wells in many foreign lands
2KI.19.24	and refreshed myself with their water.
2KI.19.24	With the sole of my foot
2KI.19.24	I stopped up all the rivers of Egypt!’
2KI.19.25	“But have you not heard?
2KI.19.25	I decided this long ago.
2KI.19.25	Long ago I planned it,
2KI.19.25	and now I am making it happen.
2KI.19.25	I planned for you to crush fortified cities
2KI.19.25	into heaps of rubble.
2KI.19.26	That is why their people have so little power
2KI.19.26	and are so frightened and confused.
2KI.19.26	They are as weak as grass,
2KI.19.26	as easily trampled as tender green shoots.
2KI.19.26	They are like grass sprouting on a housetop,
2KI.19.26	scorched before it can grow lush and tall.
2KI.19.27	“But I know you well—
2KI.19.27	where you stay
2KI.19.27	and when you come and go.
2KI.19.27	I know the way you have raged against me.
2KI.19.28	And because of your raging against me
2KI.19.28	and your arrogance, which I have heard for myself,
2KI.19.28	I will put my hook in your nose
2KI.19.28	and my bit in your mouth.
2KI.19.28	I will make you return
2KI.19.28	by the same road on which you came.”
2KI.19.29	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Here is the proof that what I say is true:
2KI.19.29	“This year you will eat only what grows up by itself,
2KI.19.29	and next year you will eat what springs up from that.
2KI.19.29	But in the third year you will plant crops and harvest them;
2KI.19.29	you will tend vineyards and eat their fruit.
2KI.19.30	And you who are left in Judah,
2KI.19.30	who have escaped the ravages of the siege,
2KI.19.30	will put roots down in your own soil
2KI.19.30	and will grow up and flourish.
2KI.19.31	For a remnant of my people will spread out from Jerusalem,
2KI.19.31	a group of survivors from Mount Zion.
2KI.19.31	The passionate commitment of the 
2KI.19.31	will make this happen!
2KI.19.32	“And this is what the 
2KI.19.32	“His armies will not enter Jerusalem.
2KI.19.32	They will not even shoot an arrow at it.
2KI.19.32	They will not march outside its gates with their shields
2KI.19.32	nor build banks of earth against its walls.
2KI.19.33	The king will return to his own country
2KI.19.33	by the same road on which he came.
2KI.19.33	He will not enter this city,
2KI.19.33	says the 
2KI.19.34	For my own honor and for the sake of my servant David,
2KI.19.34	I will defend this city and protect it.”
2KI.19.35	That night the angel of the 
2KI.19.36	Then King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and returned to his own land. He went home to his capital of Nineveh and stayed there.
2KI.19.37	One day while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons
2KI.20.1	About that time Hezekiah became deathly ill, and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to visit him. He gave the king this message: “This is what the 
2KI.20.2	When Hezekiah heard this, he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the 
2KI.20.3	“Remember, O 
2KI.20.4	But before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard,
2KI.20.5	“Go back to Hezekiah, the leader of my people. Tell him, ‘This is what the 
2KI.20.6	I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my own honor and for the sake of my servant David.’”
2KI.20.7	Then Isaiah said, “Make an ointment from figs.” So Hezekiah’s servants spread the ointment over the boil, and Hezekiah recovered!
2KI.20.8	Meanwhile, Hezekiah had said to Isaiah, “What sign will the 
2KI.20.9	Isaiah replied, “This is the sign from the 
2KI.20.10	“The shadow always moves forward,” Hezekiah replied, “so that would be easy. Make it go ten steps backward instead.” 
2KI.20.11	So Isaiah the prophet asked the 
2KI.20.12	Soon after this, Merodach-baladan
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah received the Babylonian envoys and showed them everything in his treasure-houses—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the aromatic oils. He also took them to see his armory and showed them everything in his royal treasuries! There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did those men want? Where were they from?”
2KI.20.14	Hezekiah replied, “They came from the distant land of Babylon.”
2KI.20.15	“What did they see in your palace?” Isaiah asked.
2KI.20.15	“They saw everything,” Hezekiah replied. “I showed them everything I own—all my royal treasuries.”
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to this message from the 
2KI.20.17	The time is coming when everything in your palace—all the treasures stored up by your ancestors until now—will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the 
2KI.20.18	Some of your very own sons will be taken away into exile. They will become eunuchs who will serve in the palace of Babylon’s king.”
2KI.20.19	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “This message you have given me from the 
2KI.20.20	The rest of the events in Hezekiah’s reign, including the extent of his power and how he built a pool and dug a tunnel
2KI.20.21	Hezekiah died, and his son Manasseh became the next king.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His mother was Hephzibah. 
2KI.21.2	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.21.3	He rebuilt the pagan shrines his father, Hezekiah, had destroyed. He constructed altars for Baal and set up an Asherah pole, just as King Ahab of Israel had done. He also bowed before all the powers of the heavens and worshiped them.
2KI.21.4	He built pagan altars in the Temple of the 
2KI.21.5	He built these altars for all the powers of the heavens in both courtyards of the 
2KI.21.6	Manasseh also sacrificed his own son in the fire.
2KI.21.7	Manasseh even made a carved image of Asherah and set it up in the Temple, the very place where the 
2KI.21.8	If the Israelites will be careful to obey my commands—all the laws my servant Moses gave them—I will not send them into exile from this land that I gave their ancestors.” 
2KI.21.9	But the people refused to listen, and Manasseh led them to do even more evil than the pagan nations that the 
2KI.21.10	Then the 
2KI.21.11	“King Manasseh of Judah has done many detestable things. He is even more wicked than the Amorites, who lived in this land before Israel. He has caused the people of Judah to sin with his idols.
2KI.21.12	So this is what the 
2KI.21.13	I will judge Jerusalem by the same standard I used for Samaria and the same measure
2KI.21.14	Then I will reject even the remnant of my own people who are left, and I will hand them over as plunder for their enemies. 
2KI.21.15	For they have done great evil in my sight and have angered me ever since their ancestors came out of Egypt.”
2KI.21.16	Manasseh also murdered many innocent people until Jerusalem was filled from one end to the other with innocent blood. This was in addition to the sin that he caused the people of Judah to commit, leading them to do evil in the 
2KI.21.17	The rest of the events in Manasseh’s reign and everything he did, including the sins he committed, are recorded in 
2KI.21.18	When Manasseh died, he was buried in the palace garden, the garden of Uzza. Then his son Amon became the next king.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.21.21	He followed the example of his father, worshiping the same idols his father had worshiped. 
2KI.21.22	He abandoned the 
2KI.21.23	Then Amon’s own officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace. 
2KI.21.24	But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah the next king.
2KI.21.25	The rest of the events in Amon’s reign and what he did are recorded in 
2KI.21.26	He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. Then his son Josiah became the next king.
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath. 
2KI.22.2	He did what was pleasing in the 
2KI.22.3	In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and grandson of Meshullam, the court secretary, to the Temple of the 
2KI.22.4	“Go to Hilkiah the high priest and have him count the money the gatekeepers have collected from the people at the 
2KI.22.5	Entrust this money to the men assigned to supervise the restoration of the 
2KI.22.6	They will need to hire carpenters, builders, and masons. Also have them buy the timber and the finished stone needed to repair the Temple. 
2KI.22.7	But don’t require the construction supervisors to keep account of the money they receive, for they are honest and trustworthy men.”
2KI.22.8	Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the court secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the 
2KI.22.9	Shaphan went to the king and reported, “Your officials have turned over the money collected at the Temple of the 
2KI.22.10	Shaphan also told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll.” So Shaphan read it to the king.
2KI.22.11	When the king heard what was written in the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes in despair. 
2KI.22.12	Then he gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the court secretary, and Asaiah the king’s personal adviser: 
2KI.22.13	“Go to the Temple and speak to the 
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to the New Quarter
2KI.22.15	She said to them, “The 
2KI.22.16	‘This is what the 
2KI.22.17	For my people have abandoned me and offered sacrifices to pagan gods, and I am very angry with them for everything they have done. My anger will burn against this place, and it will not be quenched.’
2KI.22.18	“But go to the king of Judah who sent you to seek the 
2KI.22.19	You were sorry and humbled yourself before the 
2KI.22.20	So I will not send the promised disaster until after you have died and been buried in peace. You will not see the disaster I am going to bring on this city.’”
2KI.22.20	So they took her message back to the king.
2KI.23.1	Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.2	And the king went up to the Temple of the 
2KI.23.3	The king took his place of authority beside the pillar and renewed the covenant in the 
2KI.23.4	Then the king instructed Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second rank and the Temple gatekeepers to remove from the 
2KI.23.5	He did away with the idolatrous priests, who had been appointed by the previous kings of Judah, for they had offered sacrifices at the pagan shrines throughout Judah and even in the vicinity of Jerusalem. They had also offered sacrifices to Baal, and to the sun, the moon, the constellations, and to all the powers of the heavens. 
2KI.23.6	The king removed the Asherah pole from the 
2KI.23.7	He also tore down the living quarters of the male and female shrine prostitutes that were inside the Temple of the 
2KI.23.8	Josiah brought to Jerusalem all the priests who were living in other towns of Judah. He also defiled the pagan shrines, where they had offered sacrifices—all the way from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the shrines at the entrance to the gate of Joshua, the governor of Jerusalem. This gate was located to the left of the city gate as one enters the city. 
2KI.23.9	The priests who had served at the pagan shrines were not allowed to serve at
2KI.23.10	Then the king defiled the altar of Topheth in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, so no one could ever again use it to sacrifice a son or daughter in the fire
2KI.23.11	He removed from the entrance of the 
2KI.23.12	Josiah tore down the altars that the kings of Judah had built on the palace roof above the upper room of Ahaz. The king destroyed the altars that Manasseh had built in the two courtyards of the 
2KI.23.13	The king also desecrated the pagan shrines east of Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Corruption, where King Solomon of Israel had built shrines for Ashtoreth, the detestable goddess of the Sidonians; and for Chemosh, the detestable god of the Moabites; and for Molech,
2KI.23.14	He smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah poles. Then he desecrated these places by scattering human bones over them.
2KI.23.15	The king also tore down the altar at Bethel—the pagan shrine that Jeroboam son of Nebat had made when he caused Israel to sin. He burned down the shrine and ground it to dust, and he burned the Asherah pole. 
2KI.23.16	Then Josiah turned around and noticed several tombs in the side of the hill. He ordered that the bones be brought out, and he burned them on the altar at Bethel to desecrate it. (This happened just as the 
2KI.23.16	Then Josiah turned and looked up at the tomb of the man of God
2KI.23.17	“What is that monument over there?” Josiah asked.
2KI.23.17	And the people of the town told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted the very things that you have just done to the altar at Bethel!”
2KI.23.18	Josiah replied, “Leave it alone. Don’t disturb his bones.” So they did not burn his bones or those of the old prophet from Samaria.
2KI.23.19	Then Josiah demolished all the buildings at the pagan shrines in the towns of Samaria, just as he had done at Bethel. They had been built by the various kings of Israel and had made the 
2KI.23.20	He executed the priests of the pagan shrines on their own altars, and he burned human bones on the altars to desecrate them. Finally, he returned to Jerusalem.
2KI.23.21	King Josiah then issued this order to all the people: “You must celebrate the Passover to the 
2KI.23.22	There had not been a Passover celebration like that since the time when the judges ruled in Israel, nor throughout all the years of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
2KI.23.23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah’s reign, this Passover was celebrated to the 
2KI.23.24	Josiah also got rid of the mediums and psychics, the household gods, the idols,
2KI.23.25	Never before had there been a king like Josiah, who turned to the 
2KI.23.26	Even so, the 
2KI.23.27	For the 
2KI.23.28	The rest of the events in Josiah’s reign and all his deeds are recorded in 
2KI.23.29	While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah and his army marched out to fight him,
2KI.23.30	Josiah’s officers took his body back in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land anointed Josiah’s son Jehoahaz and made him the next king.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.23.33	Pharaoh Neco put Jehoahaz in prison at Riblah in the land of Hamath to prevent him from ruling
2KI.23.34	Pharaoh Neco then installed Eliakim, another of Josiah’s sons, to reign in place of his father, and he changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. Jehoahaz was taken to Egypt as a prisoner, where he died.
2KI.23.35	In order to get the silver and gold demanded as tribute by Pharaoh Neco, Jehoiakim collected a tax from the people of Judah, requiring them to pay in proportion to their wealth.
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah from Rumah. 
2KI.23.37	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.24.1	During Jehoiakim’s reign, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded the land of Judah. Jehoiakim surrendered and paid him tribute for three years but then rebelled. 
2KI.24.2	Then the 
2KI.24.3	These disasters happened to Judah because of the 
2KI.24.4	who had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood. The 
2KI.24.5	The rest of the events in Jehoiakim’s reign and all his deeds are recorded in 
2KI.24.6	When Jehoiakim died, his son Jehoiachin became the next king.
2KI.24.7	The king of Egypt did not venture out of his country after that, for the king of Babylon captured the entire area formerly claimed by Egypt—from the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	Jehoiachin did what was evil in the 
2KI.24.10	During Jehoiachin’s reign, the officers of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against Jerusalem and besieged it. 
2KI.24.11	Nebuchadnezzar himself arrived at the city during the siege. 
2KI.24.12	Then King Jehoiachin, along with the queen mother, his advisers, his commanders, and his officials, surrendered to the Babylonians.
2KI.24.12	In the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, he took Jehoiachin prisoner. 
2KI.24.13	As the 
2KI.24.14	King Nebuchadnezzar took all of Jerusalem captive, including all the commanders and the best of the soldiers, craftsmen, and artisans—10,000 in all. Only the poorest people were left in the land.
2KI.24.15	Nebuchadnezzar led King Jehoiachin away as a captive to Babylon, along with the queen mother, his wives and officials, and all Jerusalem’s elite. 
2KI.24.16	He also exiled 7,000 of the best troops and 1,000 craftsmen and artisans, all of whom were strong and fit for war. 
2KI.24.17	Then the king of Babylon installed Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 
2KI.24.19	But Zedekiah did what was evil in the 
2KI.24.20	These things happened because of the 
2KI.24.20	Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2KI.25.1	So on January 15,
2KI.25.2	Jerusalem was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah’s reign.
2KI.25.3	By July 18 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah’s reign,
2KI.25.4	Then a section of the city wall was broken down. Since the city was surrounded by the Babylonians,
2KI.25.5	But the Babylonian
2KI.25.6	They captured the king and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they pronounced judgment upon Zedekiah. 
2KI.25.7	They made Zedekiah watch as they slaughtered his sons. Then they gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him in bronze chains, and led him away to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	On August 14 of that year,
2KI.25.9	He burned down the Temple of the 
2KI.25.10	Then he supervised the entire Babylonian army as they tore down the walls of Jerusalem on every side. 
2KI.25.11	Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took as exiles the rest of the people who remained in the city, the defectors who had declared their allegiance to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the population. 
2KI.25.12	But the captain of the guard allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind to care for the vineyards and fields.
2KI.25.13	The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars in front of the 
2KI.25.14	They also took all the ash buckets, shovels, lamp snuffers, ladles, and all the other bronze articles used for making sacrifices at the Temple. 
2KI.25.15	The captain of the guard also took the incense burners and basins, and all the other articles made of pure gold or silver.
2KI.25.16	The weight of the bronze from the two pillars, the Sea, and the water carts was too great to be measured. These things had been made for the 
2KI.25.17	Each of the pillars was 27 feet
2KI.25.18	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took with him as prisoners Seraiah the high priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three chief gatekeepers. 
2KI.25.19	And from among the people still hiding in the city, he took an officer who had been in charge of the Judean army; five of the king’s personal advisers; the army commander’s chief secretary, who was in charge of recruitment; and sixty other citizens. 
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them all to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	And there at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon had them all put to death. So the people of Judah were sent into exile from their land.
2KI.25.22	Then King Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan as governor over the people he had left in Judah. 
2KI.25.23	When all the army commanders and their men learned that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they went to see him at Mizpah. These included Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jezaniah
2KI.25.24	Gedaliah vowed to them that the Babylonian officials meant them no harm. “Don’t be afraid of them. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and all will go well for you,” he promised.
2KI.25.25	But in midautumn of that year,
2KI.25.26	Then all the people of Judah, from the least to the greatest, as well as the army commanders, fled in panic to Egypt, for they were afraid of what the Babylonians would do to them.
2KI.25.27	In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, Evil-merodach ascended to the Babylonian throne. He was kind to
2KI.25.28	He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a higher place than all the other exiled kings in Babylon.

1CH.12.1	The following men joined David at Ziklag while he was hiding from Saul son of Kish. They were among the warriors who fought beside David in battle. 
1CH.12.2	All of them were expert archers, and they could shoot arrows or sling stones with their left hand as well as their right. They were all relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin. 
1CH.12.3	Their leader was Ahiezer son of Shemaah from Gibeah; his brother Joash was second-in-command. These were the other warriors:
1CH.12.3	Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth;
1CH.12.3	Beracah;
1CH.12.3	Jehu from Anathoth;
1CH.12.4	Ishmaiah from Gibeon, a famous warrior and leader among the Thirty;
1CH.12.4	Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad from Gederah;
1CH.12.5	Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah from Haruph;
1CH.12.6	Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, who were Korahites;
1CH.12.7	Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
1CH.12.8	Some brave and experienced warriors from the tribe of Gad also defected to David while he was at the stronghold in the wilderness. They were expert with both shield and spear, as fierce as lions and as swift as deer on the mountains.
1CH.12.9	Ezer was their leader.
1CH.12.9	Obadiah was second.
1CH.12.9	Eliab was third.
1CH.12.10	Mishmannah was fourth.
1CH.12.10	Jeremiah was fifth.
1CH.12.11	Attai was sixth.
1CH.12.11	Eliel was seventh.

1CH.12.12	Elzabad was ninth.
1CH.12.13	Jeremiah was tenth.
1CH.12.13	Macbannai was eleventh.
1CH.12.14	These warriors from Gad were army commanders. The weakest among them could take on a hundred regular troops, and the strongest could take on a thousand! 
1CH.12.15	These were the men who crossed the Jordan River during its seasonal flooding at the beginning of the year and drove out all the people living in the lowlands on both the east and west banks.
1CH.12.16	Others from Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold. 
1CH.12.17	David went out to meet them and said, “If you have come in peace to help me, we are friends. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when I am innocent, then may the God of our ancestors see it and punish you.”
1CH.12.18	Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the leader of the Thirty, and he said,
1CH.12.18	“We are yours, David!
1CH.12.18	We are on your side, son of Jesse.
1CH.12.18	Peace and prosperity be with you,
1CH.12.18	and success to all who help you,
1CH.12.18	for your God is the one who helps you.”
1CH.12.18	So David let them join him, and he made them officers over his troops.
1CH.12.19	Some men from Manasseh defected from the Israelite army and joined David when he set out with the Philistines to fight against Saul. But as it turned out, the Philistine rulers refused to let David and his men go with them. After much discussion, they sent them back, for they said, “It will cost us our heads if David switches loyalties to Saul and turns against us.”
1CH.12.20	Here is a list of the men from Manasseh who defected to David as he was returning to Ziklag: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. Each commanded 1,000 troops from the tribe of Manasseh. 
1CH.12.21	They helped David chase down bands of raiders, for they were all brave and able warriors who became commanders in his army. 
1CH.12.22	Day after day more men joined David until he had a great army, like the army of God.
1CH.12.23	These are the numbers of armed warriors who joined David at Hebron. They were all eager to see David become king instead of Saul, just as the 
1CH.12.24	From the tribe of Judah, there were 6,800 warriors armed with shields and spears.
1CH.12.25	From the tribe of Simeon, there were 7,100 brave warriors.
1CH.12.26	From the tribe of Levi, there were 4,600 warriors. 
1CH.12.27	This included Jehoiada, leader of the family of Aaron, who had 3,700 under his command. 
1CH.12.28	This also included Zadok, a brave young warrior, with 22 members of his family who were all officers.
1CH.12.29	From the tribe of Benjamin, Saul’s relatives, there were 3,000 warriors. Most of the men from Benjamin had remained loyal to Saul until this time.
1CH.12.30	From the tribe of Ephraim, there were 20,800 brave warriors, each highly respected in his own clan.
1CH.12.31	From the half-tribe of Manasseh west of the Jordan, 18,000 men were designated by name to help David become king.
1CH.12.32	From the tribe of Issachar, there were 200 leaders of the tribe with their relatives. All these men understood the signs of the times and knew the best course for Israel to take.
1CH.12.33	From the tribe of Zebulun, there were 50,000 skilled warriors. They were fully armed and prepared for battle and completely loyal to David.
1CH.12.34	From the tribe of Naphtali, there were 1,000 officers and 37,000 warriors armed with shields and spears.
1CH.12.35	From the tribe of Dan, there were 28,600 warriors, all prepared for battle.
1CH.12.36	From the tribe of Asher, there were 40,000 trained warriors, all prepared for battle.
1CH.12.37	From the east side of the Jordan River—where the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh lived—there were 120,000 troops armed with every kind of weapon.
1CH.12.38	All these men came in battle array to Hebron with the single purpose of making David the king over all Israel. In fact, everyone in Israel agreed that David should be their king. 
1CH.12.39	They feasted and drank with David for three days, for preparations had been made by their relatives for their arrival. 
1CH.12.40	And people from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. Vast supplies of flour, fig cakes, clusters of raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle, sheep, and goats were brought to the celebration. There was great joy throughout the land of Israel.
1CH.13.1	David consulted with all his officials, including the generals and captains of his army.
1CH.13.2	Then he addressed the entire assembly of Israel as follows: “If you approve and if it is the will of the 
1CH.13.3	It is time to bring back the Ark of our God, for we neglected it during the reign of Saul.”
1CH.13.4	The whole assembly agreed to this, for the people could see it was the right thing to do. 
1CH.13.5	So David summoned all Israel, from the Shihor Brook of Egypt in the south all the way to the town of Lebo-hamath in the north, to join in bringing the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. 
1CH.13.6	Then David and all Israel went to Baalah of Judah (also called Kiriath-jearim) to bring back the Ark of God, which bears the name
1CH.13.7	They placed the Ark of God on a new cart and brought it from Abinadab’s house. Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the cart. 
1CH.13.8	David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, singing songs and playing all kinds of musical instruments—lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
1CH.13.9	But when they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon,
1CH.13.10	Then the 
1CH.13.11	David was angry because the 
1CH.13.12	David was now afraid of God, and he asked, “How can I ever bring the Ark of God back into my care?” 
1CH.13.13	So David did not move the Ark into the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-edom of Gath. 
1CH.13.14	The Ark of God remained there in Obed-edom’s house for three months, and the 
1CH.14.1	Then King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber, and stonemasons and carpenters to build him a palace. 
1CH.14.2	And David realized that the 
1CH.14.3	Then David married more wives in Jerusalem, and they had more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	These are the names of David’s sons who were born in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Eliada,
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David was told they were coming, so he marched out to meet them. 
1CH.14.9	The Philistines arrived and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.14.10	So David asked God, “Should I go out to fight the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?”
1CH.14.10	The 
1CH.14.11	So David and his troops went up to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there. “God did it!” David exclaimed. “He used me to burst through my enemies like a raging flood!” So they named that place Baal-perazim (which means “the Lord who bursts through”). 
1CH.14.12	The Philistines had abandoned their gods there, so David gave orders to burn them.
1CH.14.13	But after a while the Philistines returned and raided the valley again. 
1CH.14.14	And once again David asked God what to do. “Do not attack them straight on,” God replied. “Instead, circle around behind and attack them near the poplar
1CH.14.15	When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the poplar trees, go out and attack! That will be the signal that God is moving ahead of you to strike down the Philistine army.” 
1CH.14.16	So David did what God commanded, and they struck down the Philistine army all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
1CH.14.17	So David’s fame spread everywhere, and the 
1CH.15.1	David now built several buildings for himself in the City of David. He also prepared a place for the Ark of God and set up a special tent for it. 
1CH.15.2	Then he commanded, “No one except the Levites may carry the Ark of God. The 
1CH.15.3	Then David summoned all Israel to Jerusalem to bring the Ark of the 
1CH.15.4	This is the number of the descendants of Aaron (the priests) and the Levites who were called together:
1CH.15.5	From the clan of Kohath, 120, with Uriel as their leader.
1CH.15.6	From the clan of Merari, 220, with Asaiah as their leader.
1CH.15.7	From the clan of Gershon,
1CH.15.8	From the descendants of Elizaphan, 200, with Shemaiah as their leader.
1CH.15.9	From the descendants of Hebron, 80, with Eliel as their leader.
1CH.15.10	From the descendants of Uzziel, 112, with Amminadab as their leader.
1CH.15.11	Then David summoned the priests, Zadok and Abiathar, and these Levite leaders: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 
1CH.15.12	He said to them, “You are the leaders of the Levite families. You must purify yourselves and all your fellow Levites, so you can bring the Ark of the 
1CH.15.13	Because you Levites did not carry the Ark the first time, the anger of the 
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites purified themselves in order to bring the Ark of the 
1CH.15.15	Then the Levites carried the Ark of God on their shoulders with its carrying poles, just as the 
1CH.15.16	David also ordered the Levite leaders to appoint a choir of Levites who were singers and musicians to sing joyful songs to the accompaniment of harps, lyres, and cymbals. 
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel along with his fellow Levites: Asaph son of Berekiah, and Ethan son of Kushaiah from the clan of Merari. 
1CH.15.18	The following men were chosen as their assistants: Zechariah, Jaaziel,
1CH.15.19	The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were chosen to sound the bronze cymbals. 
1CH.15.20	Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were chosen to play the harps.
1CH.15.21	Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were chosen to play the lyres.
1CH.15.22	Kenaniah, the head Levite, was chosen as the choir leader because of his skill.
1CH.15.23	Berekiah and Elkanah were chosen to guard
1CH.15.24	Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer—all of whom were priests—were chosen to blow the trumpets as they marched in front of the Ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were chosen to guard the Ark.
1CH.15.25	Then David and the elders of Israel and the generals of the army
1CH.15.26	And because God was clearly helping the Levites as they carried the Ark of the 
1CH.15.27	David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who carried the Ark, and also the singers, and Kenaniah the choir leader. David was also wearing a priestly garment.
1CH.15.28	So all Israel brought up the Ark of the 
1CH.15.29	But as the Ark of the 
1CH.16.1	They brought the Ark of God and placed it inside the special tent David had prepared for it. And they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to God. 
1CH.16.2	When he had finished his sacrifices, David blessed the people in the name of the 
1CH.16.3	Then he gave to every man and woman in all Israel a loaf of bread, a cake of dates,
1CH.16.4	David appointed the following Levites to lead the people in worship before the Ark of the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph, the leader of this group, sounded the cymbals. Second to him was Zechariah, followed by Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel. They played the harps and lyres. 
1CH.16.6	The priests, Benaiah and Jahaziel, played the trumpets regularly before the Ark of God’s Covenant.
1CH.16.7	On that day David gave to Asaph and his fellow Levites this song of thanksgiving to the 
1CH.16.8	Give thanks to the 
1CH.16.8	Let the whole world know what he has done.
1CH.16.9	Sing to him; yes, sing his praises.
1CH.16.9	Tell everyone about his wonderful deeds.
1CH.16.10	Exult in his holy name;
1CH.16.10	rejoice, you who worship the 
1CH.16.11	Search for the 
1CH.16.11	continually seek him.
1CH.16.12	Remember the wonders he has performed,
1CH.16.12	his miracles, and the rulings he has given,
1CH.16.13	you children of his servant Israel,
1CH.16.13	you descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones.
1CH.16.14	He is the 
1CH.16.14	His justice is seen throughout the land.
1CH.16.15	Remember his covenant forever—
1CH.16.15	the commitment he made to a thousand generations.
1CH.16.16	This is the covenant he made with Abraham
1CH.16.16	and the oath he swore to Isaac.
1CH.16.17	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
1CH.16.17	and to the people of Israel as a never-ending covenant:
1CH.16.18	“I will give you the land of Canaan
1CH.16.18	as your special possession.”
1CH.16.19	He said this when you were few in number,
1CH.16.19	a tiny group of strangers in Canaan.
1CH.16.20	They wandered from nation to nation,
1CH.16.20	from one kingdom to another.
1CH.16.21	Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.
1CH.16.21	He warned kings on their behalf:
1CH.16.22	“Do not touch my chosen people,
1CH.16.22	and do not hurt my prophets.”
1CH.16.23	Let the whole earth sing to the 
1CH.16.23	Each day proclaim the good news that he saves.
1CH.16.24	Publish his glorious deeds among the nations.
1CH.16.24	Tell everyone about the amazing things he does.
1CH.16.25	Great is the 
1CH.16.25	He is to be feared above all gods.
1CH.16.26	The gods of other nations are mere idols,
1CH.16.26	but the 
1CH.16.27	Honor and majesty surround him;
1CH.16.27	strength and joy fill his dwelling.
1CH.16.28	O nations of the world, recognize the 
1CH.16.28	recognize that the 
1CH.16.29	Give to the 
1CH.16.29	Bring your offering and come into his presence.
1CH.16.29	Worship the 
1CH.16.30	Let all the earth tremble before him.
1CH.16.30	The world stands firm and cannot be shaken.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice!
1CH.16.31	Tell all the nations, “The 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise!
1CH.16.32	Let the fields and their crops burst out with joy!
1CH.16.33	Let the trees of the forest sing for joy before the 
1CH.16.33	for he is coming to judge the earth.
1CH.16.34	Give thanks to the 
1CH.16.34	His faithful love endures forever.
1CH.16.35	Cry out, “Save us, O God of our salvation!
1CH.16.35	Gather and rescue us from among the nations,
1CH.16.35	so we can thank your holy name
1CH.16.35	and rejoice and praise you.”
1CH.16.36	Praise the 
1CH.16.36	who lives from everlasting to everlasting!
1CH.16.36	And all the people shouted “Amen!” and praised the 
1CH.16.37	David arranged for Asaph and his fellow Levites to serve regularly before the Ark of the 
1CH.16.38	This group included Obed-edom (son of Jeduthun), Hosah, and sixty-eight other Levites as gatekeepers.
1CH.16.39	Meanwhile, David stationed Zadok the priest and his fellow priests at the Tabernacle of the 
1CH.16.40	They sacrificed the regular burnt offerings to the 
1CH.16.41	David also appointed Heman, Jeduthun, and the others chosen by name to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.42	They used their trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments to accompany their songs of praise to God.
1CH.16.43	Then all the people returned to their homes, and David turned and went home to bless his own family.
1CH.17.1	When David was settled in his palace, he summoned Nathan the prophet. “Look,” David said, “I am living in a beautiful cedar palace,
1CH.17.2	Nathan replied to David, “Do whatever you have in mind, for God is with you.”
1CH.17.3	But that same night God said to Nathan,
1CH.17.4	“Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the 
1CH.17.5	I have never lived in a house, from the day I brought the Israelites out of Egypt until this very day. My home has always been a tent, moving from one place to another in a Tabernacle. 
1CH.17.6	Yet no matter where I have gone with the Israelites, I have never once complained to Israel’s leaders, the shepherds of my people. I have never asked them, “Why haven’t you built me a beautiful cedar house?”’
1CH.17.7	“Now go and say to my servant David, ‘This is what the 
1CH.17.8	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before your eyes. Now I will make your name as famous as anyone who has ever lived on the earth! 
1CH.17.9	And I will provide a homeland for my people Israel, planting them in a secure place where they will never be disturbed. Evil nations won’t oppress them as they’ve done in the past, 
1CH.17.10	starting from the time I appointed judges to rule my people Israel. And I will defeat all your enemies.
1CH.17.10	“‘Furthermore, I declare that the 
1CH.17.11	For when you die and join your ancestors, I will raise up one of your descendants, one of your sons, and I will make his kingdom strong. 
1CH.17.12	He is the one who will build a house—a temple—for me. And I will secure his throne forever. 
1CH.17.13	I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my favor from him as I took it from the one who ruled before you. 
1CH.17.14	I will confirm him as king over my house and my kingdom for all time, and his throne will be secure forever.’”
1CH.17.15	So Nathan went back to David and told him everything the 
1CH.17.16	Then King David went in and sat before the 
1CH.17.16	“Who am I, O 
1CH.17.17	And now, O God, in addition to everything else, you speak of giving your servant a lasting dynasty! You speak as though I were someone very great,
1CH.17.18	“What more can I say to you about the way you have honored me? You know what your servant is really like. 
1CH.17.19	For the sake of your servant, O 
1CH.17.20	“O 
1CH.17.21	What other nation on earth is like your people Israel? What other nation, O God, have you redeemed from slavery to be your own people? You made a great name for yourself when you redeemed your people from Egypt. You performed awesome miracles and drove out the nations that stood in their way. 
1CH.17.22	You chose Israel to be your very own people forever, and you, O 
1CH.17.23	“And now, O 
1CH.17.24	And may your name be established and honored forever so that everyone will say, ‘The 
1CH.17.25	“O my God, I have been bold enough to pray to you because you have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him—a dynasty of kings! 
1CH.17.26	For you are God, O 
1CH.17.27	And now, it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, so that it will continue forever before you. For when you grant a blessing, O 
1CH.18.1	After this, David defeated and subdued the Philistines by conquering Gath and its surrounding towns. 
1CH.18.2	David also conquered the land of Moab, and the Moabites who were spared became David’s subjects and paid him tribute money.
1CH.18.3	David also destroyed the forces of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, as far as Hamath,
1CH.18.4	David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 charioteers, and 20,000 foot soldiers. He crippled all the chariot horses except enough for 100 chariots.
1CH.18.5	When Arameans from Damascus arrived to help King Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them. 
1CH.18.6	Then he placed several army garrisons
1CH.18.7	David brought the gold shields of Hadadezer’s officers to Jerusalem, 
1CH.18.8	along with a large amount of bronze from Hadadezer’s towns of Tebah
1CH.18.9	When King Toi
1CH.18.10	he sent his son Joram
1CH.18.11	King David dedicated all these gifts to the 
1CH.18.12	Abishai son of Zeruiah destroyed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
1CH.18.13	He placed army garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s subjects. In fact, the 
1CH.18.14	So David reigned over all Israel and did what was just and right for all his people. 
1CH.18.15	Joab son of Zeruiah was commander of the army. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the royal historian. 
1CH.18.16	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech
1CH.18.17	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king’s bodyguard.
1CH.19.1	Some time after this, King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun
1CH.19.2	David said, “I am going to show loyalty to Hanun because his father, Nahash, was always loyal to me.” So David sent messengers to express sympathy to Hanun about his father’s death.
1CH.19.2	But when David’s ambassadors arrived in the land of Ammon, 
1CH.19.3	the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, “Do you really think these men are coming here to honor your father? No! David has sent them to spy out the land so they can come in and conquer it!” 
1CH.19.4	So Hanun seized David’s ambassadors and shaved them, cut off their robes at the buttocks, and sent them back to David in shame.
1CH.19.5	When David heard what had happened to the men, he sent messengers to tell them, “Stay at Jericho until your beards grow out, and then come back.” For they felt deep shame because of their appearance.
1CH.19.6	When the people of Ammon realized how seriously they had angered David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 75,000 pounds
1CH.19.7	They also hired 32,000 chariots and secured the support of the king of Maacah and his army. These forces camped at Medeba, where they were joined by the Ammonite troops that Hanun had recruited from his own towns. 
1CH.19.8	When David heard about this, he sent Joab and all his warriors to fight them. 
1CH.19.9	The Ammonite troops came out and drew up their battle lines at the entrance of the city, while the other kings positioned themselves to fight in the open fields.
1CH.19.10	When Joab saw that he would have to fight on both the front and the rear, he chose some of Israel’s elite troops and placed them under his personal command to fight the Arameans in the fields. 
1CH.19.11	He left the rest of the army under the command of his brother Abishai, who was to attack the Ammonites. 
1CH.19.12	“If the Arameans are too strong for me, then come over and help me,” Joab told his brother. “And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will help you. 
1CH.19.13	Be courageous! Let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. May the 
1CH.19.14	When Joab and his troops attacked, the Arameans began to run away. 
1CH.19.15	And when the Ammonites saw the Arameans running, they also ran from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	The Arameans now realized that they were no match for Israel, so they sent messengers and summoned additional Aramean troops from the other side of the Euphrates River.
1CH.19.17	When David heard what was happening, he mobilized all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and positioned his troops in battle formation. Then David engaged the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him. 
1CH.19.18	But again the Arameans fled from the Israelites. This time David’s forces killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, including Shobach, the commander of their army. 
1CH.19.19	When Hadadezer’s allies saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they surrendered to David and became his subjects. After that, the Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.
1CH.20.1	In the spring of the year,
1CH.20.2	Then David went to Rabbah and removed the crown from the king’s head,
1CH.20.3	He also made slaves of the people of Rabbah and forced them to labor with saws, iron picks, and iron axes.
1CH.20.4	After this, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. As they fought, Sibbecai from Hushah killed Saph,
1CH.20.5	During another battle with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath of Gath. The handle of Lahmi’s spear was as thick as a weaver’s beam!
1CH.20.6	In another battle with the Philistines at Gath, they encountered a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all, who was also a descendant of the giants. 
1CH.20.7	But when he defied and taunted Israel, he was killed by Jonathan, the son of David’s brother Shimea.
1CH.20.8	These Philistines were descendants of the giants of Gath, but David and his warriors killed them.
1CH.21.1	Satan rose up against Israel and caused David to take a census of the people of Israel. 
1CH.21.2	So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, “Take a census of all the people of Israel—from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north—and bring me a report so I may know how many there are.”
1CH.21.3	But Joab replied, “May the 
1CH.21.4	But the king insisted that they take the census, so Joab traveled throughout all Israel to count the people. Then he returned to Jerusalem 
1CH.21.5	and reported the number of people to David. There were 1,100,000 warriors in all Israel who could handle a sword, and 470,000 in Judah. 
1CH.21.6	But Joab did not include the tribes of Levi and Benjamin in the census because he was so distressed at what the king had made him do.
1CH.21.7	God was very displeased with the census, and he punished Israel for it. 
1CH.21.8	Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by taking this census. Please forgive my guilt for doing this foolish thing.”
1CH.21.9	Then the 
1CH.21.10	“Go and say to David, ‘This is what the 
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David and said, “These are the choices the 
1CH.21.12	You may choose three years of famine, three months of destruction by the sword of your enemies, or three days of severe plague as the angel of the 
1CH.21.13	“I’m in a desperate situation!” David replied to Gad. “But let me fall into the hands of the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But just as the angel was preparing to destroy it, the 
1CH.21.16	David looked up and saw the angel of the 
1CH.21.17	And David said to God, “I am the one who called for the census! I am the one who has sinned and done wrong! But these people are as innocent as sheep—what have they done? O 
1CH.21.18	Then the angel of the 
1CH.21.19	So David went up to do what the 
1CH.21.20	Araunah, who was busy threshing wheat at the time, turned and saw the angel there. His four sons, who were with him, ran away and hid. 
1CH.21.21	When Araunah saw David approaching, he left his threshing floor and bowed before David with his face to the ground.
1CH.21.22	David said to Araunah, “Let me buy this threshing floor from you at its full price. Then I will build an altar to the 
1CH.21.23	“Take it, my lord the king, and use it as you wish,” Araunah said to David. “I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, and the threshing boards for wood to build a fire on the altar, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give it all to you.”
1CH.21.24	But King David replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on buying it for the full price. I will not take what is yours and give it to the 
1CH.21.25	So David gave Araunah 600 pieces of gold
1CH.21.26	David built an altar there to the 
1CH.21.27	Then the 
1CH.21.28	When David saw that the 
1CH.21.29	At that time the Tabernacle of the 
1CH.21.30	But David was not able to go there to inquire of God, because he was terrified by the drawn sword of the angel of the 
1CH.22.1	Then David said, “This will be the location for the Temple of the 
1CH.22.2	So David gave orders to call together the foreigners living in Israel, and he assigned them the task of preparing finished stone for building the Temple of God. 
1CH.22.3	David provided large amounts of iron for the nails that would be needed for the doors in the gates and for the clamps, and he gave more bronze than could be weighed. 
1CH.22.4	He also provided innumerable cedar logs, for the men of Tyre and Sidon had brought vast amounts of cedar to David.
1CH.22.5	David said, “My son Solomon is still young and inexperienced. And since the Temple to be built for the 
1CH.22.6	Then David sent for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a Temple for the 
1CH.22.7	“My son, I wanted to build a Temple to honor the name of the 
1CH.22.8	“But the 
1CH.22.9	But you will have a son who will be a man of peace. I will give him peace with his enemies in all the surrounding lands. His name will be Solomon,
1CH.22.10	He is the one who will build a Temple to honor my name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will secure the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’
1CH.22.11	“Now, my son, may the 
1CH.22.12	And may the 
1CH.22.13	For you will be successful if you carefully obey the decrees and regulations that the 
1CH.22.14	“I have worked hard to provide materials for building the Temple of the 
1CH.22.15	You have a large number of skilled stonemasons and carpenters and craftsmen of every kind. 
1CH.22.16	You have expert goldsmiths and silversmiths and workers of bronze and iron. Now begin the work, and may the 
1CH.22.17	Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to assist Solomon in this project. 
1CH.22.18	“The 
1CH.22.19	Now seek the 
1CH.23.1	When David was an old man, he appointed his son Solomon to be king over Israel. 
1CH.23.2	David summoned all the leaders of Israel, together with the priests and Levites. 
1CH.23.3	All the Levites who were thirty years old or older were counted, and the total came to 38,000. 
1CH.23.4	Then David said, “From all the Levites, 24,000 will supervise the work at the Temple of the 
1CH.23.5	Another 4,000 will work as gatekeepers, and 4,000 will praise the 
1CH.23.6	Then David divided the Levites into divisions named after the clans descended from the three sons of Levi—Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1CH.23.7	The Gershonite family units were defined by their lines of descent from Libni
1CH.23.8	Three of the descendants of Libni were Jehiel (the family leader), Zetham, and Joel. 
1CH.23.9	These were the leaders of the family of Libni.
1CH.23.9	Three of the descendants of Shimei were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. 
1CH.23.10	Four other descendants of Shimei were Jahath, Ziza,
1CH.23.11	Jahath was the family leader, and Ziza was next. Jeush and Beriah were counted as a single family because neither had many sons.
1CH.23.12	Four of the descendants of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were set apart to dedicate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices in the 
1CH.23.14	As for Moses, the man of God, his sons were included with the tribe of Levi. 
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer. 
1CH.23.16	The descendants of Gershom included Shebuel, the family leader. 
1CH.23.17	Eliezer had only one son, Rehabiah, the family leader. Rehabiah had numerous descendants.
1CH.23.18	The descendants of Izhar included Shelomith, the family leader.
1CH.23.19	The descendants of Hebron included Jeriah (the family leader), Amariah (the second), Jahaziel (the third), and Jekameam (the fourth).
1CH.23.20	The descendants of Uzziel included Micah (the family leader) and Isshiah (the second).
1CH.23.21	The descendants of Merari included Mahli and Mushi.
1CH.23.21	The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish. 
1CH.23.22	Eleazar died with no sons, only daughters. His daughters married their cousins, the sons of Kish.
1CH.23.23	Three of the descendants of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.
1CH.23.24	These were the descendants of Levi by clans, the leaders of their family groups, registered carefully by name. Each had to be twenty years old or older to qualify for service in the house of the 
1CH.23.25	For David said, “The 
1CH.23.26	Now the Levites will no longer need to carry the Tabernacle and its furnishings from place to place.” 
1CH.23.27	In accordance with David’s final instructions, all the Levites twenty years old or older were registered for service.
1CH.23.28	The work of the Levites was to assist the priests, the descendants of Aaron, as they served at the house of the 
1CH.23.29	They were in charge of the sacred bread that was set out on the table, the choice flour for the grain offerings, the wafers made without yeast, the cakes cooked in olive oil, and the other mixed breads. They were also responsible to check all the weights and measures. 
1CH.23.30	And each morning and evening they stood before the 
1CH.23.31	They assisted with the burnt offerings that were presented to the 
1CH.23.32	And so, under the supervision of the priests, the Levites watched over the Tabernacle and the Temple
1CH.24.1	This is how Aaron’s descendants, the priests, were divided into groups for service. The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
1CH.24.2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they had no sons. So only Eleazar and Ithamar were left to carry on as priests.
1CH.24.3	With the help of Zadok, who was a descendant of Eleazar, and of Ahimelech, who was a descendant of Ithamar, David divided Aaron’s descendants into groups according to their various duties. 
1CH.24.4	Eleazar’s descendants were divided into sixteen groups and Ithamar’s into eight, for there were more family leaders among the descendants of Eleazar.
1CH.24.5	All tasks were assigned to the various groups by means of sacred lots so that no preference would be shown, for there were many qualified officials serving God in the sanctuary from among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar. 
1CH.24.6	Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, acted as secretary and wrote down the names and assignments in the presence of the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the family leaders of the priests and Levites. The descendants of Eleazar and Ithamar took turns casting lots.

1CH.25.1	David and the army commanders then appointed men from the families of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to proclaim God’s messages to the accompaniment of lyres, harps, and cymbals. Here is a list of their names and their work:

1CH.27.34	Ahithophel was succeeded by Jehoiada son of Benaiah and by Abiathar. Joab was commander of the king’s army.
1CH.28.1	David summoned all the officials of Israel to Jerusalem—the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of the army divisions, the other generals and captains,
1CH.28.2	David rose to his feet and said: “My brothers and my people! It was my desire to build a Temple where the Ark of the 
1CH.28.3	but God said to me, ‘You must not build a Temple to honor my name, for you are a warrior and have shed much blood.’
1CH.28.4	“Yet the 
1CH.28.5	And from among my sons—for the 
1CH.28.6	He said to me, ‘Your son Solomon will build my Temple and its courtyards, for I have chosen him as my son, and I will be his father. 
1CH.28.7	And if he continues to obey my commands and regulations as he does now, I will make his kingdom last forever.’
1CH.28.8	“So now, with God as our witness, and in the sight of all Israel—the 
1CH.28.9	“And Solomon, my son, learn to know the God of your ancestors intimately. Worship and serve him with your whole heart and a willing mind. For the 
1CH.28.10	So take this seriously. The 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave Solomon the plans for the Temple and its surroundings, including the entry room, the storerooms, the upstairs rooms, the inner rooms, and the inner sanctuary—which was the place of atonement. 
1CH.28.12	David also gave Solomon all the plans he had in mind
1CH.28.13	The king also gave Solomon the instructions concerning the work of the various divisions of priests and Levites in the Temple of the 
1CH.28.14	David gave instructions regarding how much gold and silver should be used to make the items needed for service. 
1CH.28.15	He told Solomon the amount of gold needed for the gold lampstands and lamps, and the amount of silver for the silver lampstands and lamps, depending on how each would be used. 
1CH.28.16	He designated the amount of gold for the table on which the Bread of the Presence would be placed and the amount of silver for other tables.
1CH.28.17	David also designated the amount of gold for the solid gold meat hooks used to handle the sacrificial meat and for the basins, pitchers, and dishes, as well as the amount of silver for every dish. 
1CH.28.18	He designated the amount of refined gold for the altar of incense. Finally, he gave him a plan for the 
1CH.28.19	“Every part of this plan,” David told Solomon, “was given to me in writing from the hand of the 
1CH.28.20	Then David continued, “Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Don’t be afraid or discouraged, for the 
1CH.28.21	The various divisions of priests and Levites will serve in the Temple of God. Others with skills of every kind will volunteer, and the officials and the entire nation are at your command.”
1CH.29.1	Then King David turned to the entire assembly and said, “My son Solomon, whom God has clearly chosen as the next king of Israel, is still young and inexperienced. The work ahead of him is enormous, for the Temple he will build is not for mere mortals—it is for the 
1CH.29.2	Using every resource at my command, I have gathered as much as I could for building the Temple of my God. Now there is enough gold, silver, bronze, iron, and wood, as well as great quantities of onyx, other precious stones, costly jewels, and all kinds of fine stone and marble.
1CH.29.3	“And now, because of my devotion to the Temple of my God, I am giving all of my own private treasures of gold and silver to help in the construction. This is in addition to the building materials I have already collected for his holy Temple. 
1CH.29.4	I am donating more than 112 tons of gold
1CH.29.5	and for the other gold and silver work to be done by the craftsmen. Now then, who will follow my example and give offerings to the 
1CH.29.6	Then the family leaders, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, the generals and captains of the army,
1CH.29.7	For the construction of the Temple of God, they gave about 188 tons of gold,
1CH.29.8	They also contributed numerous precious stones, which were deposited in the treasury of the house of the 
1CH.29.9	The people rejoiced over the offerings, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the 
1CH.29.10	Then David praised the 
1CH.29.10	“O 
1CH.29.11	Yours, O 
1CH.29.12	Wealth and honor come from you alone, for you rule over everything. Power and might are in your hand, and at your discretion people are made great and given strength.
1CH.29.13	“O our God, we thank you and praise your glorious name! 
1CH.29.14	But who am I, and who are my people, that we could give anything to you? Everything we have has come from you, and we give you only what you first gave us! 
1CH.29.15	We are here for only a moment, visitors and strangers in the land as our ancestors were before us. Our days on earth are like a passing shadow, gone so soon without a trace.
1CH.29.16	“O 
1CH.29.17	I know, my God, that you examine our hearts and rejoice when you find integrity there. You know I have done all this with good motives, and I have watched your people offer their gifts willingly and joyously.
1CH.29.18	“O 
1CH.29.19	Give my son Solomon the wholehearted desire to obey all your commands, laws, and decrees, and to do everything necessary to build this Temple, for which I have made these preparations.”
1CH.29.20	Then David said to the whole assembly, “Give praise to the 
1CH.29.21	The next day they brought 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 male lambs as burnt offerings to the 
1CH.29.22	They feasted and drank in the 
1CH.29.22	And again they crowned David’s son Solomon as their new king. They anointed him before the 
1CH.29.23	So Solomon took the throne of the 
1CH.29.24	All the officials, the warriors, and the sons of King David pledged their loyalty to King Solomon. 
1CH.29.25	And the 
1CH.29.26	So David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	He reigned over Israel for forty years, seven of them in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. 
1CH.29.28	He died at a ripe old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth, and honor. Then his son Solomon ruled in his place.
1CH.29.29	All the events of King David’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in 
1CH.29.30	These accounts include the mighty deeds of his reign and everything that happened to him and to Israel and to all the surrounding kingdoms.
2CH.1.1	Solomon son of David took firm control of his kingdom, for the 
2CH.1.2	Solomon called together all the leaders of Israel—the generals and captains of the army,
2CH.1.3	Then he led the entire assembly to the place of worship in Gibeon, for God’s Tabernacle
2CH.1.4	David had already moved the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the tent he had prepared for it in Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.5	But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri and grandson of Hur was there
2CH.1.6	There in front of the Tabernacle, Solomon went up to the bronze altar in the 
2CH.1.7	That night God appeared to Solomon and said, “What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!”
2CH.1.8	Solomon replied to God, “You showed great and faithful love to David, my father, and now you have made me king in his place. 
2CH.1.9	O 
2CH.1.10	Give me the wisdom and knowledge to lead them properly,
2CH.1.11	God said to Solomon, “Because your greatest desire is to help your people, and you did not ask for wealth, riches, fame, or even the death of your enemies or a long life, but rather you asked for wisdom and knowledge to properly govern my people—
2CH.1.12	I will certainly give you the wisdom and knowledge you requested. But I will also give you wealth, riches, and fame such as no other king has had before you or will ever have in the future!”
2CH.1.13	Then Solomon returned to Jerusalem from the Tabernacle at the place of worship in Gibeon, and he reigned over Israel.
2CH.1.14	Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses.
2CH.1.15	The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah.
2CH.1.16	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt
2CH.1.17	At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver,
2CH.2.1	Solomon decided to build a Temple to honor the name of the 
2CH.2.2	He enlisted a force of 70,000 laborers, 80,000 men to quarry stone in the hill country, and 3,600 foremen.
2CH.2.3	Solomon also sent this message to King Hiram
2CH.2.3	“Send me cedar logs as you did for my father, David, when he was building his palace. 
2CH.2.4	I am about to build a Temple to honor the name of the 
2CH.2.5	“This must be a magnificent Temple because our God is greater than all other gods. 
2CH.2.6	But who can really build him a worthy home? Not even the highest heavens can contain him! So who am I to consider building a Temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices to him?
2CH.2.7	“So send me a master craftsman who can work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as with purple, scarlet, and blue cloth. He must be a skilled engraver who can work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem who were selected by my father, David.
2CH.2.8	“Also send me cedar, cypress, and red sandalwood
2CH.2.9	An immense amount of timber will be needed, for the Temple I am going to build will be very large and magnificent. 
2CH.2.10	In payment for your woodcutters, I will send 100,000 bushels of crushed wheat, 100,000 bushels of barley,
2CH.2.11	King Hiram sent this letter of reply to Solomon:
2CH.2.11	“It is because the 
2CH.2.12	Praise the 
2CH.2.13	“I am sending you a master craftsman named Huram-abi, who is extremely talented. 
2CH.2.14	His mother is from the tribe of Dan in Israel, and his father is from Tyre. He is skillful at making things from gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and he also works with stone and wood. He can work with purple, blue, and scarlet cloth and fine linen. He is also an engraver and can follow any design given to him. He will work with your craftsmen and those appointed by my lord David, your father.
2CH.2.15	“Send along the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine that my lord has mentioned. 
2CH.2.16	We will cut whatever timber you need from the Lebanon mountains and will float the logs in rafts down the coast of the Mediterranean Sea
2CH.2.17	Solomon took a census of all foreigners in the land of Israel, like the census his father had taken, and he counted 153,600. 
2CH.2.18	He assigned 70,000 of them as common laborers, 80,000 as quarry workers in the hill country, and 3,600 as foremen.
2CH.3.1	So Solomon began to build the Temple of the 
2CH.3.2	The construction began in midspring,
2CH.3.3	These are the dimensions Solomon used for the foundation of the Temple of God (using the old standard of measurement).
2CH.3.4	The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet
2CH.3.5	He paneled the main room of the Temple with cypress wood, overlaid it with fine gold, and decorated it with carvings of palm trees and chains. 
2CH.3.6	He decorated the walls of the Temple with beautiful jewels and with gold from the land of Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	He overlaid the beams, thresholds, walls, and doors throughout the Temple with gold, and he carved figures of cherubim on the walls.
2CH.3.8	He made the Most Holy Place 30 feet wide, corresponding to the width of the Temple, and 30 feet deep. He overlaid its interior with 23 tons
2CH.3.9	The gold nails that were used weighed 20 ounces
2CH.3.10	He made two figures shaped like cherubim, overlaid them with gold, and placed them in the Most Holy Place. 
2CH.3.11	The total wingspan of the two cherubim standing side by side was 30 feet. One wing of the first figure was 7
2CH.3.12	In the same way, the second figure had one wing 7
2CH.3.13	So the wingspan of the two cherubim side by side was 30 feet. They stood on their feet and faced out toward the main room of the Temple.
2CH.3.14	Across the entrance of the Most Holy Place he hung a curtain made of fine linen, decorated with blue, purple, and scarlet thread and embroidered with figures of cherubim.
2CH.3.15	For the front of the Temple, he made two pillars that were 27 feet
2CH.3.16	He made a network of interwoven chains
2CH.3.17	Then he set up the two pillars at the entrance of the Temple, one to the south of the entrance and the other to the north. He named the one on the south Jakin, and the one on the north Boaz.
2CH.4.1	Solomon
2CH.4.2	Then he cast a great round basin, 15 feet across from rim to rim, called the Sea. It was 7
2CH.4.3	It was encircled just below its rim by two rows of figures that resembled oxen. There were about six oxen per foot
2CH.4.4	The Sea was placed on a base of twelve bronze oxen, all facing outward. Three faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east, and the Sea rested on them. 
2CH.4.5	The walls of the Sea were about three inches
2CH.4.6	He also made ten smaller basins for washing the utensils for the burnt offerings. He set five on the south side and five on the north. But the priests washed themselves in the Sea.
2CH.4.7	He then cast ten gold lampstands according to the specifications that had been given, and he put them in the Temple. Five were placed against the south wall, and five were placed against the north wall.
2CH.4.8	He also built ten tables and placed them in the Temple, five along the south wall and five along the north wall. Then he molded 100 gold basins.
2CH.4.9	He then built a courtyard for the priests, and also the large outer courtyard. He made doors for the courtyard entrances and overlaid them with bronze. 
2CH.4.10	The great bronze basin called the Sea was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple.
2CH.4.11	Huram-abi also made the necessary washbasins, shovels, and bowls.
2CH.4.11	So at last Huram-abi completed everything King Solomon had assigned him to make for the Temple of God:
2CH.4.12	the two pillars;
2CH.4.12	the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
2CH.4.12	the two networks of interwoven chains that decorated the capitals;
2CH.4.13	the 400 pomegranates that hung from the chains on the capitals (two rows of pomegranates for each of the chain networks that decorated the capitals on top of the pillars);
2CH.4.14	the water carts holding the basins;
2CH.4.15	the Sea and the twelve oxen under it;
2CH.4.16	the ash buckets, the shovels, the meat hooks, and all the related articles.
2CH.4.16	Huram-abi made all these things of burnished bronze for the Temple of the 
2CH.4.17	The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan.
2CH.4.18	Solomon used such great quantities of bronze that its weight could not be determined.
2CH.4.19	Solomon also made all the furnishings for the Temple of God:
2CH.4.19	the gold altar;
2CH.4.19	the tables for the Bread of the Presence;
2CH.4.20	the lampstands and their lamps of solid gold, to burn in front of the Most Holy Place as prescribed;
2CH.4.21	the flower decorations, lamps, and tongs—all of the purest gold;
2CH.4.22	the lamp snuffers, bowls, ladles, and incense burners—all of solid gold;
2CH.4.22	the doors for the entrances to the Most Holy Place and the main room of the Temple, overlaid with gold.
2CH.5.1	So Solomon finished all his work on the Temple of the 
2CH.5.2	Solomon then summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of tribes—the leaders of the ancestral families of Israel. They were to bring the Ark of the 
2CH.5.3	So all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the annual Festival of Shelters, which is held in early autumn.
2CH.5.4	When all the elders of Israel arrived, the Levites picked up the Ark. 
2CH.5.5	The priests and Levites brought up the Ark along with the special tent
2CH.5.6	There, before the Ark, King Solomon and the entire community of Israel sacrificed so many sheep, goats, and cattle that no one could keep count!
2CH.5.7	Then the priests carried the Ark of the 
2CH.5.8	The cherubim spread their wings over the Ark, forming a canopy over the Ark and its carrying poles. 
2CH.5.9	These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place,
2CH.5.10	Nothing was in the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Mount Sinai,
2CH.5.11	Then the priests left the Holy Place. All the priests who were present had purified themselves, whether or not they were on duty that day. 
2CH.5.12	And the Levites who were musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and all their sons and brothers—were dressed in fine linen robes and stood at the east side of the altar playing cymbals, lyres, and harps. They were joined by 120 priests who were playing trumpets. 
2CH.5.13	The trumpeters and singers performed together in unison to praise and give thanks to the 
2CH.5.13	“He is good!
2CH.5.13	His faithful love endures forever!”
2CH.5.13	At that moment a thick cloud filled the Temple of the 
2CH.5.14	The priests could not continue their service because of the cloud, for the glorious presence of the 
2CH.6.1	Then Solomon prayed, “O 
2CH.6.2	Now I have built a glorious Temple for you, a place where you can live forever!”
2CH.6.3	Then the king turned around to the entire community of Israel standing before him and gave this blessing: 
2CH.6.4	“Praise the 
2CH.6.5	‘From the day I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have never chosen a city among any of the tribes of Israel as the place where a Temple should be built to honor my name. Nor have I chosen a king to lead my people Israel. 
2CH.6.6	But now I have chosen Jerusalem as the place for my name to be honored, and I have chosen David to be king over my people Israel.’”
2CH.6.7	Then Solomon said, “My father, David, wanted to build this Temple to honor the name of the 
2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	but you are not the one to do it. One of your own sons will build the Temple to honor me.’
2CH.6.10	“And now the 
2CH.6.11	There I have placed the Ark, which contains the covenant that the 
2CH.6.12	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the 
2CH.6.13	Now Solomon had made a bronze platform 7
2CH.6.14	He prayed,
2CH.6.14	“O 
2CH.6.15	You have kept your promise to your servant David, my father. You made that promise with your own mouth, and with your own hands you have fulfilled it today.
2CH.6.16	“And now, O 
2CH.6.17	Now, O 
2CH.6.18	“But will God really live on earth among people? Why, even the highest heavens cannot contain you. How much less this Temple I have built! 
2CH.6.19	Nevertheless, listen to my prayer and my plea, O 
2CH.6.20	May you watch over this Temple day and night, this place where you have said you would put your name. May you always hear the prayers I make toward this place. 
2CH.6.21	May you hear the humble and earnest requests from me and your people Israel when we pray toward this place. Yes, hear us from heaven where you live, and when you hear, forgive.
2CH.6.22	“If someone wrongs another person and is required to take an oath of innocence in front of your altar at this Temple, 
2CH.6.23	then hear from heaven and judge between your servants—the accuser and the accused. Pay back the guilty as they deserve. Acquit the innocent because of their innocence.
2CH.6.24	“If your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you, and if they turn back and acknowledge your name and pray to you here in this Temple, 
2CH.6.25	then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and return them to this land you gave to them and to their ancestors.
2CH.6.26	“If the skies are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and if they pray toward this Temple and acknowledge your name and turn from their sins because you have punished them, 
2CH.6.27	then hear from heaven and forgive the sins of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them to follow the right path, and send rain on your land that you have given to your people as their special possession.
2CH.6.28	“If there is a famine in the land or a plague or crop disease or attacks of locusts or caterpillars, or if your people’s enemies are in the land besieging their towns—whatever disaster or disease there is—
2CH.6.29	and if your people Israel pray about their troubles or sorrow, raising their hands toward this Temple, 
2CH.6.30	then hear from heaven where you live, and forgive. Give your people what their actions deserve, for you alone know each human heart. 
2CH.6.31	Then they will fear you and walk in your ways as long as they live in the land you gave to our ancestors.
2CH.6.32	“In the future, foreigners who do not belong to your people Israel will hear of you. They will come from distant lands when they hear of your great name and your strong hand and your powerful arm. And when they pray toward this Temple, 
2CH.6.33	then hear from heaven where you live, and grant what they ask of you. In this way, all the people of the earth will come to know and fear you, just as your own people Israel do. They, too, will know that this Temple I have built honors your name.
2CH.6.34	“If your people go out where you send them to fight their enemies, and if they pray to you by turning toward this city you have chosen and toward this Temple I have built to honor your name, 
2CH.6.35	then hear their prayers from heaven and uphold their cause.
2CH.6.36	“If they sin against you—and who has never sinned?—you might become angry with them and let their enemies conquer them and take them captive to a foreign land far away or near. 
2CH.6.37	But in that land of exile, they might turn to you in repentance and pray, ‘We have sinned, done evil, and acted wickedly.’ 
2CH.6.38	If they turn to you with their whole heart and soul in the land of their captivity and pray toward the land you gave to their ancestors—toward this city you have chosen, and toward this Temple I have built to honor your name—
2CH.6.39	then hear their prayers and their petitions from heaven where you live, and uphold their cause. Forgive your people who have sinned against you.
2CH.6.40	“O my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to all the prayers made to you in this place.
2CH.6.41	“And now arise, O 
2CH.6.41	along with the Ark, the symbol of your power.
2CH.6.41	May your priests, O 
2CH.6.41	may your loyal servants rejoice in your goodness.
2CH.6.42	O 
2CH.6.42	Remember your unfailing love for your servant David.”
2CH.7.1	When Solomon finished praying, fire flashed down from heaven and burned up the burnt offerings and sacrifices, and the glorious presence of the 
2CH.7.2	The priests could not enter the Temple of the 
2CH.7.3	When all the people of Israel saw the fire coming down and the glorious presence of the 
2CH.7.3	“He is good!
2CH.7.3	His faithful love endures forever!”
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to the 
2CH.7.5	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep and goats. And so the king and all the people dedicated the Temple of God. 
2CH.7.6	The priests took their assigned positions, and so did the Levites who were singing, “His faithful love endures forever!” They accompanied the singing with music from the instruments King David had made for praising the 
2CH.7.7	Solomon then consecrated the central area of the courtyard in front of the 
2CH.7.8	For the next seven days Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters.
2CH.7.9	On the eighth day they had a closing ceremony, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the Festival of Shelters for seven days. 
2CH.7.10	Then at the end of the celebration,
2CH.7.11	So Solomon finished the Temple of the 
2CH.7.12	Then one night the 
2CH.7.12	“I have heard your prayer and have chosen this Temple as the place for making sacrifices. 
2CH.7.13	At times I might shut up the heavens so that no rain falls, or command grasshoppers to devour your crops, or send plagues among you. 
2CH.7.14	Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land. 
2CH.7.15	My eyes will be open and my ears attentive to every prayer made in this place. 
2CH.7.16	For I have chosen this Temple and set it apart to be holy—a place where my name will be honored forever. I will always watch over it, for it is dear to my heart.
2CH.7.17	“As for you, if you faithfully follow me as David your father did, obeying all my commands, decrees, and regulations, 
2CH.7.18	then I will establish the throne of your dynasty. For I made this covenant with your father, David, when I said, ‘One of your descendants will always rule over Israel.’
2CH.7.19	“But if you or your descendants abandon me and disobey the decrees and commands I have given you, and if you serve and worship other gods, 
2CH.7.20	then I will uproot the people from this land that I have given them. I will reject this Temple that I have made holy to honor my name. I will make it an object of mockery and ridicule among the nations. 
2CH.7.21	And though this Temple is impressive now, all who pass by will be appalled. They will ask, ‘Why did the 
2CH.7.22	“And the answer will be, ‘Because his people abandoned the 
2CH.8.1	It took Solomon twenty years to build the 
2CH.8.2	Solomon turned his attention to rebuilding the towns that King Hiram
2CH.8.3	Solomon also fought against the town of Hamath-zobah and conquered it. 
2CH.8.4	He rebuilt Tadmor in the wilderness and built towns in the region of Hamath as supply centers. 
2CH.8.5	He fortified the towns of Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, rebuilding their walls and installing barred gates. 
2CH.8.6	He also rebuilt Baalath and other supply centers and constructed towns where his chariots and horses
2CH.8.7	There were still some people living in the land who were not Israelites, including the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
2CH.8.8	These were descendants of the nations whom the people of Israel had not destroyed. So Solomon conscripted them for his labor force, and they serve as forced laborers to this day. 
2CH.8.9	But Solomon did not conscript any of the Israelites for his labor force. Instead, he assigned them to serve as fighting men, officers in his army, commanders of his chariots, and charioteers. 
2CH.8.10	King Solomon appointed 250 of them to supervise the people.
2CH.8.11	Solomon moved his wife, Pharaoh’s daughter, from the City of David to the new palace he had built for her. He said, “My wife must not live in King David’s palace, for the Ark of the 
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon presented burnt offerings to the 
2CH.8.13	He offered the sacrifices for the Sabbaths, the new moon festivals, and the three annual festivals—the Passover celebration, the Festival of Harvest,
2CH.8.14	In assigning the priests to their duties, Solomon followed the regulations of his father, David. He also assigned the Levites to lead the people in praise and to assist the priests in their daily duties. And he assigned the gatekeepers to their gates by their divisions, following the commands of David, the man of God. 
2CH.8.15	Solomon did not deviate in any way from David’s commands concerning the priests and Levites and the treasuries.
2CH.8.16	So Solomon made sure that all the work related to building the Temple of the 
2CH.8.17	Later Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Elath,
2CH.8.18	Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own officers and manned by experienced crews of sailors. These ships sailed to Ophir with Solomon’s men and brought back to Solomon almost seventeen tons
2CH.9.1	When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She arrived with a large group of attendants and a great caravan of camels loaded with spices, large quantities of gold, and precious jewels. When she met with Solomon, she talked with him about everything she had on her mind. 
2CH.9.2	Solomon had answers for all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her. 
2CH.9.3	When the queen of Sheba realized how wise Solomon was, and when she saw the palace he had built, 
2CH.9.4	she was overwhelmed. She was also amazed at the food on his tables, the organization of his officials and their splendid clothing, the cup-bearers and their robes, and the burnt offerings
2CH.9.5	She exclaimed to the king, “Everything I heard in my country about your achievements
2CH.9.6	I didn’t believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes. In fact, I had not heard the half of your great wisdom! It is far beyond what I was told. 
2CH.9.7	How happy your people must be! What a privilege for your officials to stand here day after day, listening to your wisdom! 
2CH.9.8	Praise the 
2CH.9.9	Then she gave the king a gift of 9,000 pounds
2CH.9.10	(In addition, the crews of Hiram and Solomon brought gold from Ophir, and they also brought red sandalwood
2CH.9.11	The king used the sandalwood to make steps
2CH.9.12	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba whatever she asked for—gifts of greater value than the gifts she had given him. Then she and all her attendants returned to their own land.
2CH.9.13	Each year Solomon received about 25 tons
2CH.9.14	This did not include the additional revenue he received from merchants and traders. All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the provinces also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2CH.9.15	King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold, each weighing more than 15 pounds.
2CH.9.16	He also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold, each weighing more than 7
2CH.9.17	Then the king made a huge throne, decorated with ivory and overlaid with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	The throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, and the figure of a lion stood on each side of the throne. 
2CH.9.19	There were also twelve other lions, one standing on each end of the six steps. No other throne in all the world could be compared with it!
2CH.9.20	All of King Solomon’s drinking cups were solid gold, as were all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. They were not made of silver, for silver was considered worthless in Solomon’s day!
2CH.9.21	The king had a fleet of trading ships of Tarshish manned by the sailors sent by Hiram.
2CH.9.22	So King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king on earth. 
2CH.9.23	Kings from every nation came to consult him and to hear the wisdom God had given him. 
2CH.9.24	Year after year everyone who visited brought him gifts of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
2CH.9.25	Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his horses and chariots, and he had 12,000 horses.
2CH.9.26	He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River
2CH.9.27	The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah.
2CH.9.28	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt
2CH.9.29	The rest of the events of Solomon’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in 
2CH.9.30	Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. 
2CH.9.31	When he died, he was buried in the City of David, named for his father. Then his son Rehoboam became the next king.
2CH.10.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had gathered to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of this, he returned from Egypt, for he had fled to Egypt to escape from King Solomon. 
2CH.10.3	The leaders of Israel summoned him, and Jeroboam and all Israel went to speak with Rehoboam. 
2CH.10.4	“Your father was a hard master,” they said. “Lighten the harsh labor demands and heavy taxes that your father imposed on us. Then we will be your loyal subjects.”
2CH.10.5	Rehoboam replied, “Come back in three days for my answer.” So the people went away.
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam discussed the matter with the older men who had counseled his father, Solomon. “What is your advice?” he asked. “How should I answer these people?”
2CH.10.7	The older counselors replied, “If you are good to these people and do your best to please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your loyal subjects.”
2CH.10.8	But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the older men and instead asked the opinion of the young men who had grown up with him and were now his advisers. 
2CH.10.9	“What is your advice?” he asked them. “How should I answer these people who want me to lighten the burdens imposed by my father?”
2CH.10.10	The young men replied, “This is what you should tell those complainers who want a lighter burden: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! 
2CH.10.11	Yes, my father laid heavy burdens on you, but I’m going to make them even heavier! My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions!’”
2CH.10.12	Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to hear Rehoboam’s decision, just as the king had ordered. 
2CH.10.13	But Rehoboam spoke harshly to them, for he rejected the advice of the older counselors 
2CH.10.14	and followed the counsel of his younger advisers. He told the people, “My father laid
2CH.10.15	So the king paid no attention to the people. This turn of events was the will of God, for it fulfilled the 
2CH.10.16	When all Israel realized
2CH.10.16	“Down with the dynasty of David!
2CH.10.16	We have no interest in the son of Jesse.
2CH.10.16	Back to your homes, O Israel!
2CH.10.16	Look out for your own house, O David!”
2CH.10.16	So all the people of Israel returned home. 
2CH.10.17	But Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah.
2CH.10.18	King Rehoboam sent Adoniram,
2CH.10.19	And to this day the northern tribes of Israel have refused to be ruled by a descendant of David.
2CH.11.1	When Rehoboam arrived at Jerusalem, he mobilized the men of Judah and Benjamin—180,000 select troops—to fight against Israel and to restore the kingdom to himself.
2CH.11.2	But the 
2CH.11.3	“Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin: 
2CH.11.4	‘This is what the 
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam remained in Jerusalem and fortified various towns for the defense of Judah. 
2CH.11.6	He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These became the fortified towns of Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	Rehoboam strengthened their defenses and stationed commanders in them, and he stored supplies of food, olive oil, and wine. 
2CH.11.12	He also put shields and spears in these towns as a further safety measure. So only Judah and Benjamin remained under his control.
2CH.11.13	But all the priests and Levites living among the northern tribes of Israel sided with Rehoboam. 
2CH.11.14	The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and moved to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons would not allow them to serve the 
2CH.11.15	Jeroboam appointed his own priests to serve at the pagan shrines, where they worshiped the goat and calf idols he had made. 
2CH.11.16	From all the tribes of Israel, those who sincerely wanted to worship the 
2CH.11.17	This strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they supported Rehoboam son of Solomon, for during those years they faithfully followed in the footsteps of David and Solomon.
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam married his cousin Mahalath, the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Eliab son of Jesse. 
2CH.11.19	Mahalath had three sons—Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
2CH.11.20	Later Rehoboam married another cousin, Maacah, the granddaughter of Absalom. Maacah gave birth to Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	Rehoboam loved Maacah more than any of his other wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and they gave birth to twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
2CH.11.22	Rehoboam appointed Maacah’s son Abijah as leader among the princes, making it clear that he would be the next king. 
2CH.11.23	Rehoboam also wisely gave responsibilities to his other sons and stationed some of them in the fortified towns throughout the land of Judah and Benjamin. He provided them with generous provisions, and he found many wives for them.
2CH.12.1	But when Rehoboam was firmly established and strong, he abandoned the Law of the 
2CH.12.2	Because they were unfaithful to the 
2CH.12.3	He came with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horses,
2CH.12.4	Shishak conquered Judah’s fortified towns and then advanced to attack Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	The prophet Shemaiah then met with Rehoboam and Judah’s leaders, who had all fled to Jerusalem because of Shishak. Shemaiah told them, “This is what the 
2CH.12.6	Then the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The 
2CH.12.7	When the 
2CH.12.8	But they will become his subjects, so they will know the difference between serving me and serving earthly rulers.”
2CH.12.9	So King Shishak of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem. He ransacked the treasuries of the 
2CH.12.10	King Rehoboam later replaced them with bronze shields as substitutes, and he entrusted them to the care of the commanders of the guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace. 
2CH.12.11	Whenever the king went to the Temple of the 
2CH.12.12	Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the 
2CH.12.13	King Rehoboam firmly established himself in Jerusalem and continued to rule. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the 
2CH.12.14	But he was an evil king, for he did not seek the 
2CH.12.15	The rest of the events of Rehoboam’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in 
2CH.12.16	When Rehoboam died, he was buried in the City of David. Then his son Abijah became the next king.
2CH.13.1	Abijah began to rule over Judah in the eighteenth year of Jeroboam’s reign in Israel. 
2CH.13.2	He reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother was Maacah,
2CH.13.2	Then war broke out between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	Judah, led by King Abijah, fielded 400,000 select warriors, while Jeroboam mustered 800,000 select troops from Israel.
2CH.13.4	When the army of Judah arrived in the hill country of Ephraim, Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim and shouted to Jeroboam and all Israel: “Listen to me! 
2CH.13.5	Don’t you realize that the 
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, a mere servant of David’s son Solomon, rebelled against his master. 
2CH.13.7	Then a whole gang of scoundrels joined him, defying Solomon’s son Rehoboam when he was young and inexperienced and could not stand up to them.
2CH.13.8	“Do you really think you can stand against the kingdom of the 
2CH.13.9	But you have chased away the priests of the 
2CH.13.10	“But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	They present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the 
2CH.13.12	So you see, God is with us. He is our leader. His priests blow their trumpets and lead us into battle against you. O people of Israel, do not fight against the 
2CH.13.13	Meanwhile, Jeroboam had secretly sent part of his army around behind the men of Judah to ambush them. 
2CH.13.14	When Judah realized that they were being attacked from the front and the rear, they cried out to the 
2CH.13.15	and the men of Judah began to shout. At the sound of their battle cry, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel and routed them before Abijah and the army of Judah.
2CH.13.16	The Israelite army fled from Judah, and God handed them over to Judah in defeat. 
2CH.13.17	Abijah and his army inflicted heavy losses on them; 500,000 of Israel’s select troops were killed that day. 
2CH.13.18	So Judah defeated Israel on that occasion because they trusted in the 
2CH.13.19	Abijah and his army pursued Jeroboam’s troops and captured some of his towns, including Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, along with their surrounding villages.
2CH.13.20	So Jeroboam of Israel never regained his power during Abijah’s lifetime, and finally the 
2CH.13.21	Meanwhile, Abijah of Judah grew more and more powerful. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
2CH.13.22	The rest of the events of Abijah’s reign, including his words and deeds, are recorded in 
2CH.14.1	When Abijah died, he was buried in the City of David. Then his son Asa became the next king. There was peace in the land for ten years. 
2CH.14.2	Asa did what was pleasing and good in the sight of the 
2CH.14.3	He removed the foreign altars and the pagan shrines. He smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah poles. 
2CH.14.4	He commanded the people of Judah to seek the 
2CH.14.5	Asa also removed the pagan shrines, as well as the incense altars from every one of Judah’s towns. So Asa’s kingdom enjoyed a period of peace. 
2CH.14.6	During those peaceful years, he was able to build up the fortified towns throughout Judah. No one tried to make war against him at this time, for the 
2CH.14.7	Asa told the people of Judah, “Let us build towns and fortify them with walls, towers, gates, and bars. The land is still ours because we sought the 
2CH.14.8	King Asa had an army of 300,000 warriors from the tribe of Judah, armed with large shields and spears. He also had an army of 280,000 warriors from the tribe of Benjamin, armed with small shields and bows. Both armies were composed of well-trained fighting men.
2CH.14.9	Once an Ethiopian
2CH.14.10	so Asa deployed his armies for battle in the valley north of Mareshah.
2CH.14.11	Then Asa cried out to the 
2CH.14.12	So the 
2CH.14.13	Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar, and so many Ethiopians fell that they were unable to rally. They were destroyed by the 
2CH.14.14	While they were at Gerar, they attacked all the towns in that area, and terror from the 
2CH.14.15	They also attacked the camps of herdsmen and captured many sheep, goats, and camels before finally returning to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	Then the Spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded, 
2CH.15.2	and he went out to meet King Asa as he was returning from the battle. “Listen to me, Asa!” he shouted. “Listen, all you people of Judah and Benjamin! The 
2CH.15.3	For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a priest to teach them, and without the Law to instruct them. 
2CH.15.4	But whenever they were in trouble and turned to the 
2CH.15.5	“During those dark times, it was not safe to travel. Problems troubled the people of every land. 
2CH.15.6	Nation fought against nation, and city against city, for God was troubling them with every kind of problem. 
2CH.15.7	But as for you, be strong and courageous, for your work will be rewarded.”
2CH.15.8	When Asa heard this message from Azariah the prophet,
2CH.15.9	Then Asa called together all the people of Judah and Benjamin, along with the people of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had settled among them. For many from Israel had moved to Judah during Asa’s reign when they saw that the 
2CH.15.10	The people gathered at Jerusalem in late spring,
2CH.15.11	On that day they sacrificed to the 
2CH.15.12	Then they entered into a covenant to seek the 
2CH.15.13	They agreed that anyone who refused to seek the 
2CH.15.14	They shouted out their oath of loyalty to the 
2CH.15.15	All in Judah were happy about this covenant, for they had entered into it with all their heart. They earnestly sought after God, and they found him. And the 
2CH.15.16	King Asa even deposed his grandmother
2CH.15.17	Although the pagan shrines were not removed from Israel, Asa’s heart remained completely faithful throughout his life. 
2CH.15.18	He brought into the Temple of God the silver and gold and the various items that he and his father had dedicated.
2CH.15.19	So there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from entering or leaving King Asa’s territory in Judah.
2CH.16.2	Asa responded by removing the silver and gold from the treasuries of the Temple of the 
2CH.16.3	“Let there be a treaty
2CH.16.4	Ben-hadad agreed to King Asa’s request and sent the commanders of his army to attack the towns of Israel. They conquered the towns of Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah,
2CH.16.5	As soon as Baasha of Israel heard what was happening, he abandoned his project of fortifying Ramah and stopped all work on it. 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa called out all the men of Judah to carry away the building stones and timbers that Baasha had been using to fortify Ramah. Asa used these materials to fortify the towns of Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	At that time Hanani the seer came to King Asa and told him, “Because you have put your trust in the king of Aram instead of in the 
2CH.16.8	Don’t you remember what happened to the Ethiopians
2CH.16.9	The eyes of the 
2CH.16.10	Asa became so angry with Hanani for saying this that he threw him into prison and put him in stocks. At that time Asa also began to oppress some of his people.
2CH.16.11	The rest of the events of Asa’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in 
2CH.16.12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a serious foot disease. Yet even with the severity of his disease, he did not seek the 
2CH.16.13	So he died in the forty-first year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	He was buried in the tomb he had carved out for himself in the City of David. He was laid on a bed perfumed with sweet spices and fragrant ointments, and the people built a huge funeral fire in his honor.
2CH.17.1	Then Jehoshaphat, Asa’s son, became the next king. He strengthened Judah to stand against any attack from Israel. 
2CH.17.2	He stationed troops in all the fortified towns of Judah, and he assigned additional garrisons to the land of Judah and to the towns of Ephraim that his father, Asa, had captured.
2CH.17.3	The 
2CH.17.4	He sought his father’s God and obeyed his commands instead of following the evil practices of the kingdom of Israel. 
2CH.17.5	So the 
2CH.17.6	He was deeply committed to
2CH.17.7	In the third year of his reign Jehoshaphat sent his officials to teach in all the towns of Judah. These officials included Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah. 
2CH.17.8	He sent Levites along with them, including Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah. He also sent out the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 
2CH.17.9	They took copies of the Book of the Law of the 
2CH.17.10	Then the fear of the 
2CH.17.11	Some of the Philistines brought him gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats.
2CH.17.12	So Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful and built fortresses and storage cities throughout Judah. 
2CH.17.13	He stored numerous supplies in Judah’s towns and stationed an army of seasoned troops at Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	His army was enrolled according to ancestral clans.
2CH.17.14	From Judah there were 300,000 troops organized in units of 1,000, under the command of Adnah. 
2CH.17.15	Next in command was Jehohanan, who commanded 280,000 troops. 
2CH.17.16	Next was Amasiah son of Zicri, who volunteered for the 
2CH.17.17	From Benjamin there were 200,000 troops equipped with bows and shields. They were under the command of Eliada, a veteran soldier. 
2CH.17.18	Next in command was Jehozabad, who commanded 180,000 armed men.
2CH.17.19	These were the troops stationed in Jerusalem to serve the king, besides those Jehoshaphat stationed in the fortified towns throughout Judah.
2CH.18.1	Jehoshaphat enjoyed great riches and high esteem, and he made an alliance with Ahab of Israel by having his son marry Ahab’s daughter. 
2CH.18.2	A few years later he went to Samaria to visit Ahab, who prepared a great banquet for him and his officials. They butchered great numbers of sheep, goats, and cattle for the feast. Then Ahab enticed Jehoshaphat to join forces with him to recover Ramoth-gilead.
2CH.18.3	“Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?” King Ahab of Israel asked King Jehoshaphat of Judah.
2CH.18.3	Jehoshaphat replied, “Why, of course! You and I are as one, and my troops are your troops. We will certainly join you in battle.” 
2CH.18.4	Then Jehoshaphat added, “But first let’s find out what the 
2CH.18.5	So the king of Israel summoned the prophets, 400 of them, and asked them, “Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold back?”
2CH.18.5	They all replied, “Yes, go right ahead! God will give the king victory.”
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not also a prophet of the 
2CH.18.7	The king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, “There is one more man who could consult the 
2CH.18.7	Jehoshaphat replied, “That’s not the way a king should talk! Let’s hear what he has to say.”
2CH.18.8	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Quick! Bring Micaiah son of Imlah.”
2CH.18.9	King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on thrones at the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria. All of Ahab’s prophets were prophesying there in front of them. 
2CH.18.10	One of them, Zedekiah son of Kenaanah, made some iron horns and proclaimed, “This is what the 
2CH.18.11	All the other prophets agreed. “Yes,” they said, “go up to Ramoth-gilead and be victorious, for the 
2CH.18.12	Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him, “Look, all the prophets are promising victory for the king. Be sure that you agree with them and promise success.”
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah replied, “As surely as the 
2CH.18.14	When Micaiah arrived before the king, Ahab asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold back?”
2CH.18.14	Micaiah replied sarcastically, “Yes, go up and be victorious, for you will have victory over them!”
2CH.18.15	But the king replied sharply, “How many times must I demand that you speak only the truth to me when you speak for the 
2CH.18.16	Then Micaiah told him, “In a vision I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the 
2CH.18.17	“Didn’t I tell you?” the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat. “He never prophesies anything but trouble for me.”
2CH.18.18	Then Micaiah continued, “Listen to what the 
2CH.18.19	And the 
2CH.18.19	“There were many suggestions, 
2CH.18.20	and finally a spirit approached the 
2CH.18.20	“‘How will you do this?’ the 
2CH.18.21	“And the spirit replied, ‘I will go out and inspire all of Ahab’s prophets to speak lies.’
2CH.18.21	“‘You will succeed,’ said the 
2CH.18.22	“So you see, the 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face. “Since when did the Spirit of the 
2CH.18.24	And Micaiah replied, “You will find out soon enough when you are trying to hide in some secret room!”
2CH.18.25	“Arrest him!” the king of Israel ordered. “Take him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to my son Joash. 
2CH.18.26	Give them this order from the king: ‘Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return safely from the battle!’”
2CH.18.27	But Micaiah replied, “If you return safely, it will mean that the 
2CH.18.28	So King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah led their armies against Ramoth-gilead. 
2CH.18.29	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “As we go into battle, I will disguise myself so no one will recognize me, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
2CH.18.30	Meanwhile, the king of Aram had issued these orders to his chariot commanders: “Attack only the king of Israel! Don’t bother with anyone else.” 
2CH.18.31	So when the Aramean chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they went after him. “There is the king of Israel!” they shouted. But Jehoshaphat called out, and the 
2CH.18.32	As soon as the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they stopped chasing him.
2CH.18.33	An Aramean soldier, however, randomly shot an arrow at the Israelite troops and hit the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. “Turn the horses
2CH.18.34	The battle raged all that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans. In the evening, just as the sun was setting, he died.
2CH.19.1	When King Jehoshaphat of Judah arrived safely home in Jerusalem, 
2CH.19.2	Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him. “Why should you help the wicked and love those who hate the 
2CH.19.3	Even so, there is some good in you, for you have removed the Asherah poles throughout the land, and you have committed yourself to seeking God.”
2CH.19.4	Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, but he went out among the people, traveling from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, encouraging the people to return to the 
2CH.19.5	He appointed judges throughout the nation in all the fortified towns, 
2CH.19.6	and he said to them, “Always think carefully before pronouncing judgment. Remember that you do not judge to please people but to please the 
2CH.19.7	Fear the 
2CH.19.8	In Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests and clan leaders in Israel to serve as judges
2CH.19.9	These were his instructions to them: “You must always act in the fear of the 
2CH.19.10	Whenever a case comes to you from fellow citizens in an outlying town, whether a murder case or some other violation of God’s laws, commands, decrees, or regulations, you must warn them not to sin against the 
2CH.19.11	“Amariah the high priest will have final say in all cases involving the 
2CH.20.1	After this, the armies of the Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites
2CH.20.2	Messengers came and told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army from Edom
2CH.20.3	Jehoshaphat was terrified by this news and begged the 
2CH.20.4	So people from all the towns of Judah came to Jerusalem to seek the 
2CH.20.5	Jehoshaphat stood before the community of Judah and Jerusalem in front of the new courtyard at the Temple of the 
2CH.20.6	He prayed, “O 
2CH.20.7	O our God, did you not drive out those who lived in this land when your people Israel arrived? And did you not give this land forever to the descendants of your friend Abraham? 
2CH.20.8	Your people settled here and built this Temple to honor your name. 
2CH.20.9	They said, ‘Whenever we are faced with any calamity such as war,
2CH.20.10	“And now see what the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir are doing. You would not let our ancestors invade those nations when Israel left Egypt, so they went around them and did not destroy them. 
2CH.20.11	Now see how they reward us! For they have come to throw us out of your land, which you gave us as an inheritance. 
2CH.20.12	O our God, won’t you stop them? We are powerless against this mighty army that is about to attack us. We do not know what to do, but we are looking to you for help.”
2CH.20.13	As all the men of Judah stood before the 
2CH.20.14	the Spirit of the 
2CH.20.15	He said, “Listen, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Listen, King Jehoshaphat! This is what the 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow, march out against them. You will find them coming up through the ascent of Ziz at the end of the valley that opens into the wilderness of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	But you will not even need to fight. Take your positions; then stand still and watch the 
2CH.20.18	Then King Jehoshaphat bowed low with his face to the ground. And all the people of Judah and Jerusalem did the same, worshiping the 
2CH.20.19	Then the Levites from the clans of Kohath and Korah stood to praise the 
2CH.20.20	Early the next morning the army of Judah went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. On the way Jehoshaphat stopped and said, “Listen to me, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Believe in the 
2CH.20.21	After consulting the people, the king appointed singers to walk ahead of the army, singing to the 
2CH.20.21	“Give thanks to the 
2CH.20.21	his faithful love endures forever!”
2CH.20.22	At the very moment they began to sing and give praise, the 
2CH.20.23	The armies of Moab and Ammon turned against their allies from Mount Seir and killed every one of them. After they had destroyed the army of Seir, they began attacking each other. 
2CH.20.24	So when the army of Judah arrived at the lookout point in the wilderness, all they saw were dead bodies lying on the ground as far as they could see. Not a single one of the enemy had escaped.
2CH.20.25	King Jehoshaphat and his men went out to gather the plunder. They found vast amounts of equipment, clothing,
2CH.20.26	On the fourth day they gathered in the Valley of Blessing,
2CH.20.27	Then all the men returned to Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat leading them, overjoyed that the 
2CH.20.28	They marched into Jerusalem to the music of harps, lyres, and trumpets, and they proceeded to the Temple of the 
2CH.20.29	When all the surrounding kingdoms heard that the 
2CH.20.30	So Jehoshaphat’s kingdom was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side.
2CH.20.31	So Jehoshaphat ruled over the land of Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
2CH.20.32	Jehoshaphat was a good king, following the ways of his father, Asa. He did what was pleasing in the 
2CH.20.33	During his reign, however, he failed to remove all the pagan shrines, and the people never fully committed themselves to follow the God of their ancestors.
2CH.20.34	The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in 
2CH.20.35	Some time later King Jehoshaphat of Judah made an alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, who was very wicked.
2CH.20.36	Together they built a fleet of trading ships
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat. He said, “Because you have allied yourself with King Ahaziah, the 
2CH.21.1	When Jehoshaphat died, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Jehoram became the next king.
2CH.21.2	Jehoram’s brothers—the other sons of Jehoshaphat—were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.
2CH.21.3	Their father had given each of them valuable gifts of silver, gold, and costly items, and also some of Judah’s fortified towns. However, he designated Jehoram as the next king because he was the oldest. 
2CH.21.4	But when Jehoram had become solidly established as king, he killed all his brothers and some of the other leaders of Judah.
2CH.21.5	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. 
2CH.21.6	But Jehoram followed the example of the kings of Israel and was as wicked as King Ahab, for he had married one of Ahab’s daughters. So Jehoram did what was evil in the 
2CH.21.7	But the 
2CH.21.8	During Jehoram’s reign, the Edomites revolted against Judah and crowned their own king. 
2CH.21.9	So Jehoram went out with his full army and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he went out at night and attacked them
2CH.21.10	Even so, Edom has been independent from Judah to this day. The town of Libnah also revolted about that same time. All this happened because Jehoram had abandoned the 
2CH.21.11	He had built pagan shrines in the hill country of Judah and had led the people of Jerusalem and Judah to give themselves to pagan gods and to go astray.
2CH.21.12	Then Elijah the prophet wrote Jehoram this letter:
2CH.21.12	“This is what the 
2CH.21.13	Instead, you have been as evil as the kings of Israel. You have led the people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship idols, just as King Ahab did in Israel. And you have even killed your own brothers, men who were better than you. 
2CH.21.14	So now the 
2CH.21.15	You yourself will suffer with a severe intestinal disease that will get worse each day until your bowels come out.”
2CH.21.16	Then the 
2CH.21.17	They marched against Judah, broke down its defenses, and carried away everything of value in the royal palace, including the king’s sons and his wives. Only his youngest son, Ahaziah,
2CH.21.18	After all this, the 
2CH.21.19	The disease grew worse and worse, and at the end of two years it caused his bowels to come out, and he died in agony. His people did not build a great funeral fire to honor him as they had done for his ancestors.
2CH.21.20	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. No one was sorry when he died. They buried him in the City of David, but not in the royal cemetery.
2CH.22.1	Then the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram’s youngest son, their next king, since the marauding bands who came with the Arabs
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah was twenty-two
2CH.22.3	Ahaziah also followed the evil example of King Ahab’s family, for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong. 
2CH.22.4	He did what was evil in the 
2CH.22.5	Following their evil advice, Ahaziah joined Joram,
2CH.22.6	he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had received at Ramoth.
2CH.22.7	But God had decided that this visit would be Ahaziah’s downfall. While he was there, Ahaziah went out with Joram to meet Jehu grandson of Nimshi,
2CH.22.8	While Jehu was executing judgment against the family of Ahab, he happened to meet some of Judah’s officials and Ahaziah’s relatives
2CH.22.9	Then Jehu’s men searched for Ahaziah, and they found him hiding in the city of Samaria. They brought him to Jehu, who killed him. Ahaziah was given a decent burial because the people said, “He was the grandson of Jehoshaphat—a man who sought the 
2CH.22.10	When Athaliah, the mother of King Ahaziah of Judah, learned that her son was dead, she began to destroy the rest of Judah’s royal family. 
2CH.22.11	But Ahaziah’s sister Jehosheba,
2CH.22.12	Joash remained hidden in the Temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land.
2CH.23.1	In the seventh year of Athaliah’s reign, Jehoiada the priest decided to act. He summoned his courage and made a pact with five army commanders: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zicri. 
2CH.23.2	These men traveled secretly throughout Judah and summoned the Levites and clan leaders in all the towns to come to Jerusalem. 
2CH.23.3	They all gathered at the Temple of God, where they made a solemn pact with Joash, the young king.
2CH.23.3	Jehoiada said to them, “Here is the king’s son! The time has come for him to reign! The 
2CH.23.4	This is what you must do. When you priests and Levites come on duty on the Sabbath, a third of you will serve as gatekeepers. 
2CH.23.5	Another third will go over to the royal palace, and the final third will be at the Foundation Gate. Everyone else should stay in the courtyards of the 
2CH.23.6	Remember, only the priests and Levites on duty may enter the Temple of the 
2CH.23.7	You Levites, form a bodyguard around the king and keep your weapons in hand. Kill anyone who tries to enter the Temple. Stay with the king wherever he goes.”
2CH.23.8	So the Levites and all the people of Judah did everything as Jehoiada the priest ordered. The commanders took charge of the men reporting for duty that Sabbath, as well as those who were going off duty. Jehoiada the priest did not let anyone go home after their shift ended. 
2CH.23.9	Then Jehoiada supplied the commanders with the spears and the large and small shields that had once belonged to King David and were stored in the Temple of God. 
2CH.23.10	He stationed all the people around the king, with their weapons ready. They formed a line from the south side of the Temple around to the north side and all around the altar.
2CH.23.11	Then Jehoiada and his sons brought out Joash, the king’s son, placed the crown on his head, and presented him with a copy of God’s laws.
2CH.23.12	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and the shouts of praise to the king, she hurried to the 
2CH.23.13	When she arrived, she saw the newly crowned king standing in his place of authority by the pillar at the Temple entrance. The commanders and trumpeters were surrounding him, and people from all over the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Singers with musical instruments were leading the people in a great celebration. When Athaliah saw all this, she tore her clothes in despair and shouted, “Treason! Treason!”
2CH.23.14	Then Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders who were in charge of the troops, “Take her to the soldiers in front of the Temple,
2CH.23.15	So they seized her and led her out to the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and they killed her there.
2CH.23.16	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and the king and the people that they would be the 
2CH.23.17	And all the people went over to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They demolished the altars and smashed the idols, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
2CH.23.18	Jehoiada now put the priests and Levites in charge of the Temple of the 
2CH.23.19	He also stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the 
2CH.23.20	Then the commanders, nobles, rulers, and all the people of the land escorted the king from the Temple of the 
2CH.23.21	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was peaceful because Athaliah had been killed.
2CH.24.1	Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 
2CH.24.2	Joash did what was pleasing in the 
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada chose two wives for Joash, and he had sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	At one point Joash decided to repair and restore the Temple of the 
2CH.24.5	He summoned the priests and Levites and gave them these instructions: “Go to all the towns of Judah and collect the required annual offerings, so that we can repair the Temple of your God. Do not delay!” But the Levites did not act immediately.
2CH.24.6	So the king called for Jehoiada the high priest and asked him, “Why haven’t you demanded that the Levites go out and collect the Temple taxes from the towns of Judah and from Jerusalem? Moses, the servant of the 
2CH.24.7	Over the years the followers of wicked Athaliah had broken into the Temple of God, and they had used all the dedicated things from the Temple of the 
2CH.24.8	So now the king ordered a chest to be made and set outside the gate leading to the Temple of the 
2CH.24.9	Then a proclamation was sent throughout Judah and Jerusalem, telling the people to bring to the 
2CH.24.10	This pleased all the leaders and the people, and they gladly brought their money and filled the chest with it.
2CH.24.11	Whenever the chest became full, the Levites would carry it to the king’s officials. Then the court secretary and an officer of the high priest would come and empty the chest and take it back to the Temple again. This went on day after day, and a large amount of money was collected. 
2CH.24.12	The king and Jehoiada gave the money to the construction supervisors, who hired masons and carpenters to restore the Temple of the 
2CH.24.13	The men in charge of the renovation worked hard and made steady progress. They restored the Temple of God according to its original design and strengthened it. 
2CH.24.14	When all the repairs were finished, they brought the remaining money to the king and Jehoiada. It was used to make various articles for the Temple of the 
2CH.24.15	Jehoiada lived to a very old age, finally dying at 130. 
2CH.24.16	He was buried among the kings in the City of David, because he had done so much good in Israel for God and his Temple.
2CH.24.17	But after Jehoiada’s death, the leaders of Judah came and bowed before King Joash and persuaded him to listen to their advice. 
2CH.24.18	They decided to abandon the Temple of the 
2CH.24.19	Yet the 
2CH.24.20	Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, “This is what God says: Why do you disobey the 
2CH.24.21	Then the leaders plotted to kill Zechariah, and King Joash ordered that they stone him to death in the courtyard of the 
2CH.24.22	That was how King Joash repaid Jehoiada for his loyalty—by killing his son. Zechariah’s last words as he died were, “May the 
2CH.24.23	In the spring of the year
2CH.24.24	Although the Arameans attacked with only a small army, the 
2CH.24.25	The Arameans withdrew, leaving Joash severely wounded. But his own officials plotted to kill him for murdering the son
2CH.24.26	The assassins were Jozacar,
2CH.24.27	The account of the sons of Joash, the prophecies about him, and the record of his restoration of the Temple of God are written in 
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother was Jehoaddin
2CH.25.2	Amaziah did what was pleasing in the 
2CH.25.3	When Amaziah was well established as king, he executed the officials who had assassinated his father. 
2CH.25.4	However, he did not kill the children of the assassins, for he obeyed the command of the 
2CH.25.5	Then Amaziah organized the army, assigning generals and captains
2CH.25.6	He also paid about 7,500 pounds
2CH.25.7	But a man of God came to him and said, “Your Majesty, do not hire troops from Israel, for the 
2CH.25.8	If you let them go with your troops into battle, you will be defeated by the enemy no matter how well you fight. God will overthrow you, for he has the power to help you or to trip you up.”
2CH.25.9	Amaziah asked the man of God, “But what about all that silver I paid to hire the army of Israel?”
2CH.25.9	The man of God replied, “The 
2CH.25.10	So Amaziah discharged the hired troops and sent them back to Ephraim. This made them very angry with Judah, and they returned home in a great rage.
2CH.25.11	Then Amaziah summoned his courage and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where they killed 10,000 Edomite troops from Seir. 
2CH.25.12	They captured another 10,000 and took them to the top of a cliff and threw them off, dashing them to pieces on the rocks below.
2CH.25.13	Meanwhile, the hired troops that Amaziah had sent home raided several of the towns of Judah between Samaria and Beth-horon. They killed 3,000 people and carried off great quantities of plunder.
2CH.25.14	When King Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought with him idols taken from the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down in front of them, and offered sacrifices to them! 
2CH.25.15	This made the 
2CH.25.16	But the king interrupted him and said, “Since when have I made you the king’s counselor? Be quiet now before I have you killed!”
2CH.25.16	So the prophet stopped with this warning: “I know that God has determined to destroy you because you have done this and have refused to accept my counsel.”
2CH.25.17	After consulting with his advisers, King Amaziah of Judah sent this challenge to Israel’s king Jehoash,
2CH.25.18	But King Jehoash of Israel replied to King Amaziah of Judah with this story: “Out in the Lebanon mountains, a thistle sent a message to a mighty cedar tree: ‘Give your daughter in marriage to my son.’ But just then a wild animal of Lebanon came by and stepped on the thistle, crushing it!
2CH.25.19	“You are saying, ‘I have defeated Edom,’ and you are very proud of it. But my advice is to stay at home. Why stir up trouble that will only bring disaster on you and the people of Judah?”
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah refused to listen, for God was determined to destroy him for turning to the gods of Edom. 
2CH.25.21	So King Jehoash of Israel mobilized his army against King Amaziah of Judah. The two armies drew up their battle lines at Beth-shemesh in Judah. 
2CH.25.22	Judah was routed by the army of Israel, and its army scattered and fled for home. 
2CH.25.23	King Jehoash of Israel captured Judah’s king, Amaziah son of Joash and grandson of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. Then he brought him to Jerusalem, where he demolished 600 feet
2CH.25.24	He carried off all the gold and silver and all the articles from the Temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-edom. He also seized the treasures of the royal palace, along with hostages, and then returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.25	King Amaziah of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of King Jehoash of Israel. 
2CH.25.26	The rest of the events in Amaziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in 
2CH.25.27	After Amaziah turned away from the 
2CH.25.28	They brought his body back on a horse, and he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David.
2CH.26.1	All the people of Judah had crowned Amaziah’s sixteen-year-old son, Uzziah, as king in place of his father. 
2CH.26.2	After his father’s death, Uzziah rebuilt the town of Elath
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother was Jecoliah from Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	He did what was pleasing in the 
2CH.26.5	Uzziah sought God during the days of Zechariah, who taught him to fear God.
2CH.26.6	Uzziah declared war on the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. Then he built new towns in the Ashdod area and in other parts of Philistia. 
2CH.26.7	God helped him in his wars against the Philistines, his battles with the Arabs of Gur,
2CH.26.8	The Meunites
2CH.26.9	Uzziah built fortified towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the angle in the wall. 
2CH.26.10	He also constructed forts in the wilderness and dug many water cisterns, because he kept great herds of livestock in the foothills of Judah
2CH.26.11	Uzziah had an army of well-trained warriors, ready to march into battle, unit by unit. This army had been mustered and organized by Jeiel, the secretary of the army, and his assistant, Maaseiah. They were under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king’s officials. 
2CH.26.12	These regiments of mighty warriors were commanded by 2,600 clan leaders. 
2CH.26.13	The army consisted of 307,500 men, all elite troops. They were prepared to assist the king against any enemy.
2CH.26.14	Uzziah provided the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and sling stones. 
2CH.26.15	And he built structures on the walls of Jerusalem, designed by experts to protect those who shot arrows and hurled large stones
2CH.26.16	But when he had become powerful, he also became proud, which led to his downfall. He sinned against the 
2CH.26.17	Azariah the high priest went in after him with eighty other priests of the 
2CH.26.18	They confronted King Uzziah and said, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the 
2CH.26.19	Uzziah, who was holding an incense burner, became furious. But as he was standing there raging at the priests before the incense altar in the 
2CH.26.20	When Azariah the high priest and all the other priests saw the leprosy, they rushed him out. And the king himself was eager to get out because the 
2CH.26.21	So King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in isolation in a separate house, for he was excluded from the Temple of the 
2CH.26.22	The rest of the events of Uzziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
2CH.26.23	When Uzziah died, he was buried with his ancestors; his grave was in a nearby burial field belonging to the kings, for the people said, “He had leprosy.” And his son Jotham became the next king.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
2CH.27.2	Jotham did what was pleasing in the 
2CH.27.3	Jotham rebuilt the upper gate of the Temple of the 
2CH.27.4	He built towns in the hill country of Judah and constructed fortresses and towers in the wooded areas. 
2CH.27.5	Jotham went to war against the Ammonites and conquered them. Over the next three years he received from them an annual tribute of 7,500 pounds
2CH.27.6	King Jotham became powerful because he was careful to live in obedience to the 
2CH.27.7	The rest of the events of Jotham’s reign, including all his wars and other activities, are recorded in 
2CH.27.8	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. 
2CH.27.9	When Jotham died, he was buried in the City of David. And his son Ahaz became the next king.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. He did not do what was pleasing in the sight of the 
2CH.28.2	Instead, he followed the example of the kings of Israel. He cast metal images for the worship of Baal. 
2CH.28.3	He offered sacrifices in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, even sacrificing his own sons in the fire.
2CH.28.4	He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the pagan shrines and on the hills and under every green tree.
2CH.28.5	Because of all this, the 
2CH.28.6	In a single day Pekah son of Remaliah, Israel’s king, killed 120,000 of Judah’s troops, all of them experienced warriors, because they had abandoned the 
2CH.28.7	Then Zicri, a warrior from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah, the king’s son; Azrikam, the king’s palace commander; and Elkanah, the king’s second-in-command. 
2CH.28.8	The armies of Israel captured 200,000 women and children from Judah and seized tremendous amounts of plunder, which they took back to Samaria.
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	And now you are planning to make slaves of these people from Judah and Jerusalem. What about your own sins against the 
2CH.28.11	Listen to me and return these prisoners you have taken, for they are your own relatives. Watch out, because now the 
2CH.28.12	Then some of the leaders of Israel
2CH.28.13	“You must not bring the prisoners here!” they declared. “We cannot afford to add to our sins and guilt. Our guilt is already great, and the 
2CH.28.14	So the warriors released the prisoners and handed over the plunder in the sight of the leaders and all the people. 
2CH.28.15	Then the four men just mentioned by name came forward and distributed clothes from the plunder to the prisoners who were naked. They provided clothing and sandals to wear, gave them enough food and drink, and dressed their wounds with olive oil. They put those who were weak on donkeys and took all the prisoners back to their own people in Jericho, the city of palms. Then they returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	At that time King Ahaz of Judah asked the king of Assyria for help. 
2CH.28.17	The armies of Edom had again invaded Judah and taken captives. 
2CH.28.18	And the Philistines had raided towns located in the foothills of Judah
2CH.28.19	The 
2CH.28.20	So when King Tiglath-pileser
2CH.28.21	Ahaz took valuable items from the 
2CH.28.22	Even during this time of trouble, King Ahaz continued to reject the 
2CH.28.23	He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus who had defeated him, for he said, “Since these gods helped the kings of Aram, they will help me, too, if I sacrifice to them.” But instead, they led to his ruin and the ruin of all Judah.
2CH.28.24	The king took the various articles from the Temple of God and broke them into pieces. He shut the doors of the 
2CH.28.25	He made pagan shrines in all the towns of Judah for offering sacrifices to other gods. In this way, he aroused the anger of the 
2CH.28.26	The rest of the events of Ahaz’s reign and everything he did, from beginning to end, are recorded in 
2CH.28.27	When Ahaz died, he was buried in Jerusalem but not in the royal cemetery of the kings of Judah. Then his son Hezekiah became the next king.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became the king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	He did what was pleasing in the 
2CH.29.3	In the very first month of the first year of his reign, Hezekiah reopened the doors of the Temple of the 
2CH.29.4	He summoned the priests and Levites to meet him at the courtyard east of the Temple. 
2CH.29.5	He said to them, “Listen to me, you Levites! Purify yourselves, and purify the Temple of the 
2CH.29.6	Our ancestors were unfaithful and did what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.29.7	They also shut the doors to the Temple’s entry room, and they snuffed out the lamps. They stopped burning incense and presenting burnt offerings at the sanctuary of the God of Israel.
2CH.29.8	“That is why the 
2CH.29.9	Because of this, our fathers have been killed in battle, and our sons and daughters and wives have been captured. 
2CH.29.10	But now I will make a covenant with the 
2CH.29.11	My sons, do not neglect your duties any longer! The 
2CH.29.12	Then these Levites got right to work:
2CH.29.12	From the clan of Kohath: Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah.
2CH.29.12	From the clan of Merari: Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel.
2CH.29.12	From the clan of Gershon: Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah.
2CH.29.13	From the family of Elizaphan: Shimri and Jeiel.
2CH.29.13	From the family of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah.
2CH.29.14	From the family of Heman: Jehiel and Shimei.
2CH.29.14	From the family of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel.
2CH.29.15	These men called together their fellow Levites, and they all purified themselves. Then they began to cleanse the Temple of the 
2CH.29.16	The priests went into the sanctuary of the Temple of the 
2CH.29.17	They began the work in early spring, on the first day of the new year,
2CH.29.18	Then the Levites went to King Hezekiah and gave him this report: “We have cleansed the entire Temple of the 
2CH.29.19	We have also recovered all the items discarded by King Ahaz when he was unfaithful and closed the Temple. They are now in front of the altar of the 
2CH.29.20	Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials and went to the Temple of the 
2CH.29.21	They brought seven bulls, seven rams, and seven male lambs as a burnt offering, together with seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the Temple, and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, to sacrifice the animals on the altar of the 
2CH.29.22	So they killed the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Next they killed the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar. And finally, they did the same with the male lambs. 
2CH.29.23	The male goats for the sin offering were then brought before the king and the assembly of people, who laid their hands on them. 
2CH.29.24	The priests then killed the goats as a sin offering and sprinkled their blood on the altar to make atonement for the sins of all Israel. The king had specifically commanded that this burnt offering and sin offering should be made for all Israel.
2CH.29.25	King Hezekiah then stationed the Levites at the Temple of the 
2CH.29.26	The Levites then took their positions around the Temple with the instruments of David, and the priests took their positions with the trumpets.
2CH.29.27	Then Hezekiah ordered that the burnt offering be placed on the altar. As the burnt offering was presented, songs of praise to the 
2CH.29.28	The entire assembly worshiped the 
2CH.29.29	Then the king and everyone with him bowed down in worship. 
2CH.29.30	King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to praise the 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah declared, “Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the 
2CH.29.32	The people brought to the 
2CH.29.33	They also brought 600 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats as sacred offerings.
2CH.29.34	But there were too few priests to prepare all the burnt offerings. So their relatives the Levites helped them until the work was finished and more priests had been purified, for the Levites had been more conscientious about purifying themselves than the priests had been. 
2CH.29.35	There was an abundance of burnt offerings, along with the usual liquid offerings, and a great deal of fat from the many peace offerings.
2CH.29.35	So the Temple of the 
2CH.29.36	And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of what God had done for the people, for everything had been accomplished so quickly.
2CH.30.1	King Hezekiah now sent word to all Israel and Judah, and he wrote letters of invitation to the people of Ephraim and Manasseh. He asked everyone to come to the Temple of the 
2CH.30.2	The king, his officials, and all the community of Jerusalem decided to celebrate Passover a month later than usual.
2CH.30.3	They were unable to celebrate it at the prescribed time because not enough priests could be purified by then, and the people had not yet assembled at Jerusalem.
2CH.30.4	This plan for keeping the Passover seemed right to the king and all the people. 
2CH.30.5	So they sent a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north, inviting everyone to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the 
2CH.30.6	At the king’s command, runners were sent throughout Israel and Judah. They carried letters that said:
2CH.30.6	“O people of Israel, return to the 
2CH.30.7	Do not be like your ancestors and relatives who abandoned the 
2CH.30.8	Do not be stubborn, as they were, but submit yourselves to the 
2CH.30.9	“For if you return to the 
2CH.30.10	The runners went from town to town throughout Ephraim and Manasseh and as far as the territory of Zebulun. But most of the people just laughed at the runners and made fun of them. 
2CH.30.11	However, some people from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.
2CH.30.12	At the same time, God’s hand was on the people in the land of Judah, giving them all one heart to obey the orders of the king and his officials, who were following the word of the 
2CH.30.13	So a huge crowd assembled at Jerusalem in midspring
2CH.30.14	They set to work and removed the pagan altars from Jerusalem. They took away all the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
2CH.30.15	On the fourteenth day of the second month, one month later than usual,
2CH.30.16	Then they took their places at the Temple as prescribed in the Law of Moses, the man of God. The Levites brought the sacrificial blood to the priests, who then sprinkled it on the altar.
2CH.30.17	Since many of the people had not purified themselves, the Levites had to slaughter their Passover lamb for them, to set them apart for the 
2CH.30.18	Most of those who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not purified themselves. But King Hezekiah prayed for them, and they were allowed to eat the Passover meal anyway, even though this was contrary to the requirements of the Law. For Hezekiah said, “May the 
2CH.30.19	who decide to follow the 
2CH.30.20	And the 
2CH.30.21	So the people of Israel who were present in Jerusalem joyously celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. Each day the Levites and priests sang to the 
2CH.30.22	Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites regarding the skill they displayed as they served the 
2CH.30.23	The entire assembly then decided to continue the festival another seven days, so they celebrated joyfully for another week. 
2CH.30.24	King Hezekiah gave the people 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep and goats for offerings, and the officials donated 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep and goats. Meanwhile, many more priests purified themselves.
2CH.30.25	The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, including the priests, the Levites, all who came from the land of Israel, the foreigners who came to the festival, and all those who lived in Judah. 
2CH.30.26	There was great joy in the city, for Jerusalem had not seen a celebration like this one since the days of Solomon, King David’s son. 
2CH.30.27	Then the priests and Levites stood and blessed the people, and God heard their prayer from his holy dwelling in heaven.
2CH.31.1	When the festival ended, the Israelites who attended went to all the towns of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh, and they smashed all the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and removed the pagan shrines and altars. After this, the Israelites returned to their own towns and homes.
2CH.31.2	Hezekiah then organized the priests and Levites into divisions to offer the burnt offerings and peace offerings, and to worship and give thanks and praise to the 
2CH.31.3	The king also made a personal contribution of animals for the daily morning and evening burnt offerings, the weekly Sabbath festivals, the monthly new moon festivals, and the annual festivals as prescribed in the Law of the 
2CH.31.4	In addition, he required the people in Jerusalem to bring a portion of their goods to the priests and Levites, so they could devote themselves fully to the Law of the 
2CH.31.5	When the people of Israel heard these requirements, they responded generously by bringing the first share of their grain, new wine, olive oil, honey, and all the produce of their fields. They brought a large quantity—a tithe of all they produced. 
2CH.31.6	The people who had moved to Judah from Israel, and the people of Judah themselves, brought in the tithes of their cattle, sheep, and goats and a tithe of the things that had been dedicated to the 
2CH.31.7	They began piling them up in late spring, and the heaps continued to grow until early autumn.
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw these huge piles, they thanked the 
2CH.31.9	“Where did all this come from?” Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites.
2CH.31.10	And Azariah the high priest, from the family of Zadok, replied, “Since the people began bringing their gifts to the 
2CH.31.11	Hezekiah ordered that storerooms be prepared in the Temple of the 
2CH.31.12	the people faithfully brought all the gifts, tithes, and other items dedicated for use in the Temple. Conaniah the Levite was put in charge, assisted by his brother Shimei. 
2CH.31.13	The supervisors under them were Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath, and Benaiah. These appointments were made by King Hezekiah and Azariah, the chief official in the Temple of God.
2CH.31.14	Kore son of Imnah the Levite, who was the gatekeeper at the East Gate, was put in charge of distributing the voluntary offerings given to God, the gifts, and the things that had been dedicated to the 
2CH.31.15	His faithful assistants were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah. They distributed the gifts among the families of priests in their towns by their divisions, dividing the gifts fairly among old and young alike. 
2CH.31.16	They distributed the gifts to all males three years old or older, regardless of their place in the genealogical records. The distribution went to all who would come to the 
2CH.31.17	They distributed gifts to the priests who were listed by their families in the genealogical records, and to the Levites twenty years old or older who were listed according to their jobs and their divisions. 
2CH.31.18	Food allotments were also given to the families of all those listed in the genealogical records, including their little babies, wives, sons, and daughters. For they had all been faithful in purifying themselves.
2CH.31.19	As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who were living in the open villages around the towns, men were appointed by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to all the Levites listed in the genealogical records.
2CH.31.20	In this way, King Hezekiah handled the distribution throughout all Judah, doing what was pleasing and good in the sight of the 
2CH.31.21	In all that he did in the service of the Temple of God and in his efforts to follow God’s laws and commands, Hezekiah sought his God wholeheartedly. As a result, he was very successful.
2CH.32.1	After Hezekiah had faithfully carried out this work, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified towns, giving orders for his army to break through their walls. 
2CH.32.2	When Hezekiah realized that Sennacherib also intended to attack Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he consulted with his officials and military advisers, and they decided to stop the flow of the springs outside the city. 
2CH.32.4	They organized a huge work crew to stop the flow of the springs, cutting off the brook that ran through the fields. For they said, “Why should the kings of Assyria come here and find plenty of water?”
2CH.32.5	Then Hezekiah worked hard at repairing all the broken sections of the wall, erecting towers, and constructing a second wall outside the first. He also reinforced the supporting terraces
2CH.32.6	He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate. Then Hezekiah encouraged them by saying: 
2CH.32.7	“Be strong and courageous! Don’t be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria or his mighty army, for there is a power far greater on our side! 
2CH.32.8	He may have a great army, but they are merely men. We have the 
2CH.32.9	While King Sennacherib of Assyria was still besieging the town of Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah and all the people in the city:
2CH.32.10	“This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says: What are you trusting in that makes you think you can survive my siege of Jerusalem? 
2CH.32.11	Hezekiah has said, ‘The 
2CH.32.12	Don’t you realize that Hezekiah is the very person who destroyed all the 
2CH.32.13	“Surely you must realize what I and the other kings of Assyria before me have done to all the people of the earth! Were any of the gods of those nations able to rescue their people from my power? 
2CH.32.14	Which of their gods was able to rescue its people from the destructive power of my predecessors? What makes you think your God can rescue you from me? 
2CH.32.15	Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you! Don’t let him fool you like this! I say it again—no god of any nation or kingdom has ever yet been able to rescue his people from me or my ancestors. How much less will your God rescue you from my power!”
2CH.32.16	And Sennacherib’s officers further mocked the 
2CH.32.17	The king also sent letters scorning the 
2CH.32.18	The Assyrian officials who brought the letters shouted this in Hebrew
2CH.32.19	These officers talked about the God of Jerusalem as though he were one of the pagan gods, made by human hands.
2CH.32.20	Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to God in heaven. 
2CH.32.21	And the 
2CH.32.22	That is how the 
2CH.32.23	From then on King Hezekiah became highly respected among all the surrounding nations, and many gifts for the 
2CH.32.24	About that time Hezekiah became deathly ill. He prayed to the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah did not respond appropriately to the kindness shown him, and he became proud. So the 
2CH.32.26	Then Hezekiah humbled himself and repented of his pride, as did the people of Jerusalem. So the 
2CH.32.27	Hezekiah was very wealthy and highly honored. He built special treasury buildings for his silver, gold, precious stones, and spices, and for his shields and other valuable items. 
2CH.32.28	He also constructed many storehouses for his grain, new wine, and olive oil; and he made many stalls for his cattle and pens for his flocks of sheep and goats. 
2CH.32.29	He built many towns and acquired vast flocks and herds, for God had given him great wealth. 
2CH.32.30	He blocked up the upper spring of Gihon and brought the water down through a tunnel to the west side of the City of David. And so he succeeded in everything he did.
2CH.32.31	However, when ambassadors arrived from Babylon to ask about the remarkable events that had taken place in the land, God withdrew from Hezekiah in order to test him and to see what was really in his heart.
2CH.32.32	The rest of the events in Hezekiah’s reign and his acts of devotion are recorded in 
2CH.32.33	When Hezekiah died, he was buried in the upper area of the royal cemetery, and all Judah and Jerusalem honored him at his death. And his son Manasseh became the next king.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. 
2CH.33.2	He did what was evil in the 
2CH.33.3	He rebuilt the pagan shrines his father, Hezekiah, had broken down. He constructed altars for the images of Baal and set up Asherah poles. He also bowed before all the powers of the heavens and worshiped them.
2CH.33.4	He built pagan altars in the Temple of the 
2CH.33.5	He built these altars for all the powers of the heavens in both courtyards of the 
2CH.33.6	Manasseh also sacrificed his own sons in the fire
2CH.33.7	Manasseh even took a carved idol he had made and set it up in God’s Temple, the very place where God had told David and his son Solomon: “My name will be honored forever in this Temple and in Jerusalem—the city I have chosen from among all the tribes of Israel. 
2CH.33.8	If the Israelites will be careful to obey my commands—all the laws, decrees, and regulations given through Moses—I will not send them into exile from this land that I set aside for your ancestors.” 
2CH.33.9	But Manasseh led the people of Judah and Jerusalem to do even more evil than the pagan nations that the 
2CH.33.10	The 
2CH.33.11	So the 
2CH.33.12	But while in deep distress, Manasseh sought the 
2CH.33.13	And when he prayed, the 
2CH.33.14	After this Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, from west of the Gihon Spring in the Kidron Valley to the Fish Gate, and continuing around the hill of Ophel. He built the wall very high. And he stationed his military officers in all of the fortified towns of Judah. 
2CH.33.15	Manasseh also removed the foreign gods and the idol from the 
2CH.33.16	Then he restored the altar of the 
2CH.33.17	However, the people still sacrificed at the pagan shrines, though only to the 
2CH.33.18	The rest of the events of Manasseh’s reign, his prayer to God, and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the 
2CH.33.19	Manasseh’s prayer, the account of the way God answered him, and an account of all his sins and unfaithfulness are recorded in 
2CH.33.20	When Manasseh died, he was buried in his palace. Then his son Amon became the next king.
2CH.33.21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. 
2CH.33.22	He did what was evil in the 
2CH.33.23	But unlike his father, he did not humble himself before the 
2CH.33.24	Then Amon’s own officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace. 
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah the next king.
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. 
2CH.34.2	He did what was pleasing in the 
2CH.34.3	During the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David. Then in the twelfth year he began to purify Judah and Jerusalem, destroying all the pagan shrines, the Asherah poles, and the carved idols and cast images. 
2CH.34.4	He ordered that the altars of Baal be demolished and that the incense altars which stood above them be broken down. He also made sure that the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images were smashed and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. 
2CH.34.5	He burned the bones of the pagan priests on their own altars, and so he purified Judah and Jerusalem.
2CH.34.6	He did the same thing in the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, even as far as Naphtali, and in the regions
2CH.34.7	He destroyed the pagan altars and the Asherah poles, and he crushed the idols into dust. He cut down all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Finally, he returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	In the eighteenth year of his reign, after he had purified the land and the Temple, Josiah appointed Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of Jerusalem, and Joah son of Joahaz, the royal historian, to repair the Temple of the 
2CH.34.9	They gave Hilkiah the high priest the money that had been collected by the Levites who served as gatekeepers at the Temple of God. The gifts were brought by people from Manasseh, Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, as well as from all Judah, Benjamin, and the people of Jerusalem.
2CH.34.10	He entrusted the money to the men assigned to supervise the restoration of the 
2CH.34.11	They hired carpenters and builders, who purchased finished stone for the walls and timber for the rafters and beams. They restored what earlier kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.
2CH.34.12	The workers served faithfully under the leadership of Jahath and Obadiah, Levites of the Merarite clan, and Zechariah and Meshullam, Levites of the Kohathite clan. Other Levites, all of whom were skilled musicians, 
2CH.34.13	were put in charge of the laborers of the various trades. Still others assisted as secretaries, officials, and gatekeepers.
2CH.34.14	While they were bringing out the money collected at the 
2CH.34.15	Hilkiah said to Shaphan the court secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the 
2CH.34.16	Shaphan took the scroll to the king and reported, “Your officials are doing everything they were assigned to do. 
2CH.34.17	The money that was collected at the Temple of the 
2CH.34.18	Shaphan also told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll.” So Shaphan read it to the king.
2CH.34.19	When the king heard what was written in the Law, he tore his clothes in despair. 
2CH.34.20	Then he gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah,
2CH.34.21	“Go to the Temple and speak to the 
2CH.34.22	So Hilkiah and the other men went to the New Quarter
2CH.34.23	She said to them, “The 
2CH.34.24	‘This is what the 
2CH.34.25	For my people have abandoned me and offered sacrifices to pagan gods, and I am very angry with them for everything they have done. My anger will be poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.’
2CH.34.26	“But go to the king of Judah who sent you to seek the 
2CH.34.27	You were sorry and humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this city and its people. You humbled yourself and tore your clothing in despair and wept before me in repentance. And I have indeed heard you, says the 
2CH.34.28	So I will not send the promised disaster until after you have died and been buried in peace. You yourself will not see the disaster I am going to bring on this city and its people.’”
2CH.34.28	So they took her message back to the king.
2CH.34.29	Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	And the king went up to the Temple of the 
2CH.34.31	The king took his place of authority beside the pillar and renewed the covenant in the 
2CH.34.32	And he required everyone in Jerusalem and the people of Benjamin to make a similar pledge. The people of Jerusalem did so, renewing their covenant with God, the God of their ancestors.
2CH.34.33	So Josiah removed all detestable idols from the entire land of Israel and required everyone to worship the 
2CH.35.1	Then Josiah announced that the Passover of the 
2CH.35.2	Josiah also assigned the priests to their duties and encouraged them in their work at the Temple of the 
2CH.35.3	He issued this order to the Levites, who were to teach all Israel and who had been set apart to serve the

2CH.35.7	Then Josiah provided 30,000 lambs and young goats for the people’s Passover offerings, along with 3,000 cattle, all from the king’s own flocks and herds. 
2CH.35.8	The king’s officials also made willing contributions to the people, priests, and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the administrators of God’s Temple, gave the priests 2,600 lambs and young goats and 300 cattle as Passover offerings. 
2CH.35.9	The Levite leaders—Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad—gave 5,000 lambs and young goats and 500 cattle to the Levites for their Passover offerings.
2CH.35.10	When everything was ready for the Passover celebration, the priests and the Levites took their places, organized by their divisions, as the king had commanded. 
2CH.35.11	The Levites then slaughtered the Passover lambs and presented the blood to the priests, who sprinkled the blood on the altar while the Levites prepared the animals. 
2CH.35.12	They divided the burnt offerings among the people by their family groups, so they could offer them to the 
2CH.35.13	Then they roasted the Passover lambs as prescribed; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, kettles, and pans, and brought them out quickly so the people could eat them.
2CH.35.14	Afterward the Levites prepared Passover offerings for themselves and for the priests—the descendants of Aaron—because the priests had been busy from morning till night offering the burnt offerings and the fat portions. The Levites took responsibility for all these preparations.
2CH.35.15	The musicians, descendants of Asaph, were in their assigned places, following the commands that had been given by David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king’s seer. The gatekeepers guarded the gates and did not need to leave their posts of duty, for their Passover offerings were prepared for them by their fellow Levites.
2CH.35.16	The entire ceremony for the 
2CH.35.17	All the Israelites present in Jerusalem celebrated Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. 
2CH.35.18	Never since the time of the prophet Samuel had there been such a Passover. None of the kings of Israel had ever kept a Passover as Josiah did, involving all the priests and Levites, all the people of Jerusalem, and people from all over Judah and Israel. 
2CH.35.19	This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign.
2CH.35.20	After Josiah had finished restoring the Temple, King Neco of Egypt led his army up from Egypt to do battle at Carchemish on the Euphrates River, and Josiah and his army marched out to fight him.
2CH.35.21	But King Neco sent messengers to Josiah with this message:
2CH.35.21	“What do you want with me, king of Judah? I have no quarrel with you today! I am on my way to fight another nation, and God has told me to hurry! Do not interfere with God, who is with me, or he will destroy you.”
2CH.35.22	But Josiah refused to listen to Neco, to whom God had indeed spoken, and he would not turn back. Instead, he disguised himself and led his army into battle on the plain of Megiddo. 
2CH.35.23	But the enemy archers hit King Josiah with their arrows and wounded him. He cried out to his men, “Take me from the battle, for I am badly wounded!”
2CH.35.24	So they lifted Josiah out of his chariot and placed him in another chariot. Then they brought him back to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried there in the royal cemetery. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him. 
2CH.35.25	The prophet Jeremiah composed funeral songs for Josiah, and to this day choirs still sing these sad songs about his death. These songs of sorrow have become a tradition and are recorded in 
2CH.35.26	The rest of the events of Josiah’s reign and his acts of devotion (carried out according to what was written in the Law of the 
2CH.35.27	from beginning to end—all are recorded in 
2CH.36.1	Then the people of the land took Josiah’s son Jehoahaz and made him the next king in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.2	Jehoahaz
2CH.36.3	Then he was deposed by the king of Egypt, who demanded that Judah pay 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold
2CH.36.4	The king of Egypt then installed Eliakim, the brother of Jehoahaz, as the next king of Judah and Jerusalem, and he changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. Then Neco took Jehoahaz to Egypt as a prisoner.
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. He did what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.6	Then King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and captured it, and he bound Jehoiakim in bronze chains and led him away to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the treasures from the Temple of the

2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. 
2CH.36.12	But Zedekiah did what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.13	He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, even though he had taken an oath of loyalty in God’s name. Zedekiah was a hard and stubborn man, refusing to turn to the 
2CH.36.14	Likewise, all the leaders of the priests and the people became more and more unfaithful. They followed all the pagan practices of the surrounding nations, desecrating the Temple of the 
2CH.36.15	The 
2CH.36.16	But the people mocked these messengers of God and despised their words. They scoffed at the prophets until the 
2CH.36.17	So the 
2CH.36.18	The king took home to Babylon all the articles, large and small, used in the Temple of God, and the treasures from both the 
2CH.36.19	Then his army burned the Temple of God, tore down the walls of Jerusalem, burned all the palaces, and completely destroyed everything of value.
2CH.36.20	The few who survived were taken as exiles to Babylon, and they became servants to the king and his sons until the kingdom of Persia came to power.
2CH.36.21	So the message of the 
2CH.36.22	In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia,
2CH.36.23	“This is what King Cyrus of Persia says:

EZR.1.3	Any of you who are his people may go to Jerusalem in Judah to rebuild this Temple of the 
EZR.1.4	Wherever this Jewish remnant is found, let their neighbors contribute toward their expenses by giving them silver and gold, supplies for the journey, and livestock, as well as a voluntary offering for the Temple of God in Jerusalem.”
EZR.1.5	Then God stirred the hearts of the priests and Levites and the leaders of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple of the 
EZR.1.6	And all their neighbors assisted by giving them articles of silver and gold, supplies for the journey, and livestock. They gave them many valuable gifts in addition to all the voluntary offerings.
EZR.1.7	King Cyrus himself brought out the articles that King Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the 
EZR.1.8	Cyrus directed Mithredath, the treasurer of Persia, to count these items and present them to Sheshbazzar, the leader of the exiles returning to Judah.
EZR.1.9	This is a list of the items that were returned:

EZR.1.11	In all, there were 5,400 articles of gold and silver. Sheshbazzar brought all of these along when the exiles went from Babylon to Jerusalem.
EZR.2.1	Here is the list of the Jewish exiles of the provinces who returned from their captivity. King Nebuchadnezzar had deported them to Babylon, but now they returned to Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah where they originally lived.

EZR.2.58	In all, the Temple servants and the descendants of Solomon’s servants numbered 392.
EZR.2.59	Another group returned at this time from the towns of Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Kerub, Addan, and Immer. However, they could not prove that they or their families were descendants of Israel. 
EZR.2.60	This group included the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda—a total of 652 people.
EZR.2.61	Three families of priests—Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai—also returned. (This Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of Barzillai of Gilead, and he had taken her family name.) 
EZR.2.62	They searched for their names in the genealogical records, but they were not found, so they were disqualified from serving as priests. 
EZR.2.63	The governor told them not to eat the priests’ share of food from the sacrifices until a priest could consult the 
EZR.2.64	So a total of 42,360 people returned to Judah, 
EZR.2.65	in addition to 7,337 servants and 200 singers, both men and women. 
EZR.2.66	They took with them 736 horses, 245 mules, 
EZR.2.67	435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.

EZR.2.69	and each leader gave as much as he could. The total of their gifts came to 61,000 gold coins,
EZR.2.70	So the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, the Temple servants, and some of the common people settled in villages near Jerusalem. The rest of the people returned to their own towns throughout Israel.
EZR.3.1	In early autumn,
EZR.3.2	Then Jeshua son of Jehozadak
EZR.3.3	Even though the people were afraid of the local residents, they rebuilt the altar at its old site. Then they began to sacrifice burnt offerings on the altar to the 
EZR.3.4	They celebrated the Festival of Shelters as prescribed in the Law, sacrificing the number of burnt offerings specified for each day of the festival. 
EZR.3.5	They also offered the regular burnt offerings and the offerings required for the new moon celebrations and the annual festivals as prescribed by the 
EZR.3.6	Fifteen days before the Festival of Shelters began,
EZR.3.7	Then the people hired masons and carpenters and bought cedar logs from the people of Tyre and Sidon, paying them with food, wine, and olive oil. The logs were brought down from the Lebanon mountains and floated along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea
EZR.3.8	The construction of the Temple of God began in midspring,
EZR.3.9	The workers at the Temple of God were supervised by Jeshua with his sons and relatives, and Kadmiel and his sons, all descendants of Hodaviah.
EZR.3.10	When the builders completed the foundation of the 
EZR.3.11	With praise and thanks, they sang this song to the 
EZR.3.11	“He is so good!
EZR.3.11	His faithful love for Israel endures forever!”
EZR.3.11	Then all the people gave a great shout, praising the 
EZR.3.12	But many of the older priests, Levites, and other leaders who had seen the first Temple wept aloud when they saw the new Temple’s foundation. The others, however, were shouting for joy. 
EZR.3.13	The joyful shouting and weeping mingled together in a loud noise that could be heard far in the distance.
EZR.4.1	The enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were rebuilding a Temple to the 
EZR.4.2	So they approached Zerubbabel and the other leaders and said, “Let us build with you, for we worship your God just as you do. We have sacrificed to him ever since King Esarhaddon of Assyria brought us here.”
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other leaders of Israel replied, “You may have no part in this work. We alone will build the Temple for the 
EZR.4.4	Then the local residents tried to discourage and frighten the people of Judah to keep them from their work. 
EZR.4.5	They bribed agents to work against them and to frustrate their plans. This went on during the entire reign of King Cyrus of Persia and lasted until King Darius of Persia took the throne.
EZR.4.6	Years later when Xerxes
EZR.4.7	Even later, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia,
EZR.4.8	Rehum the governor and Shimshai the court secretary wrote the letter, telling King Artaxerxes about the situation in Jerusalem. 
EZR.4.9	They greeted the king for all their colleagues—the judges and local leaders, the people of Tarpel, the Persians, the Babylonians, and the people of Erech and Susa (that is, Elam). 
EZR.4.10	They also sent greetings from the rest of the people whom the great and noble Ashurbanipal
EZR.4.11	This is a copy of their letter:
EZR.4.11	“To King Artaxerxes, from your loyal subjects in the province west of the Euphrates River.
EZR.4.12	“The king should know that the Jews who came here to Jerusalem from Babylon are rebuilding this rebellious and evil city. They have already laid the foundation and will soon finish its walls. 
EZR.4.13	And the king should know that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, it will be much to your disadvantage, for the Jews will then refuse to pay their tribute, customs, and tolls to you.
EZR.4.14	“Since we are your loyal subjects
EZR.4.15	We suggest that a search be made in your ancestors’ records, where you will discover what a rebellious city this has been in the past. In fact, it was destroyed because of its long and troublesome history of revolt against the kings and countries who controlled it. 
EZR.4.16	We declare to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, the province west of the Euphrates River will be lost to you.”
EZR.4.17	Then King Artaxerxes sent this reply:
EZR.4.17	“To Rehum the governor, Shimshai the court secretary, and their colleagues living in Samaria and throughout the province west of the Euphrates River. Greetings.
EZR.4.18	“The letter you sent has been translated and read to me. 
EZR.4.19	I ordered a search of the records and have found that Jerusalem has indeed been a hotbed of insurrection against many kings. In fact, rebellion and revolt are normal there! 
EZR.4.20	Powerful kings have ruled over Jerusalem and the entire province west of the Euphrates River, receiving tribute, customs, and tolls. 
EZR.4.21	Therefore, issue orders to have these men stop their work. That city must not be rebuilt except at my express command. 
EZR.4.22	Be diligent, and don’t neglect this matter, for we must not permit the situation to harm the king’s interests.”
EZR.4.23	When this letter from King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum, Shimshai, and their colleagues, they hurried to Jerusalem. Then, with a show of strength, they forced the Jews to stop building.
EZR.4.24	So the work on the Temple of God in Jerusalem had stopped, and it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.
EZR.5.1	At that time the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem. They prophesied in the name of the God of Israel who was over them. 
EZR.5.2	Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jehozadak
EZR.5.3	But Tattenai, governor of the province west of the Euphrates River,
EZR.5.4	They also asked for
EZR.5.5	But because their God was watching over them, the leaders of the Jews were not prevented from building until a report was sent to Darius and he returned his decision.
EZR.5.6	This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai the governor, Shethar-bozenai, and the other officials of the province west of the Euphrates River sent to King Darius:
EZR.5.7	“To King Darius. Greetings.
EZR.5.8	“The king should know that we went to the construction site of the Temple of the great God in the province of Judah. It is being rebuilt with specially prepared stones, and timber is being laid in its walls. The work is going forward with great energy and success.
EZR.5.9	“We asked the leaders, ‘Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and restore this structure?’ 
EZR.5.10	And we demanded their names so that we could tell you who the leaders were.
EZR.5.11	“This was their answer: ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the Temple that was built here many years ago by a great king of Israel. 
EZR.5.12	But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he abandoned them to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon,
EZR.5.13	However, King Cyrus of Babylon,
EZR.5.14	King Cyrus returned the gold and silver cups that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple of God in Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of Babylon. These cups were taken from that temple and presented to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom King Cyrus appointed as governor of Judah. 
EZR.5.15	The king instructed him to return the cups to their place in Jerusalem and to rebuild the Temple of God there on its original site. 
EZR.5.16	So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the Temple of God in Jerusalem. The people have been working on it ever since, though it is not yet completed.’
EZR.5.17	“Therefore, if it pleases the king, we request that a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to discover whether King Cyrus ever issued a decree to rebuild God’s Temple in Jerusalem. And then let the king send us his decision in this matter.”
EZR.6.1	So King Darius issued orders that a search be made in the Babylonian archives, which were stored in the treasury. 
EZR.6.2	But it was at the fortress at Ecbatana in the province of Media that a scroll was found. This is what it said:
EZR.6.2	“Memorandum:
EZR.6.3	“In the first year of King Cyrus’s reign, a decree was sent out concerning the Temple of God at Jerusalem.
EZR.6.3	“Let the Temple be rebuilt on the site where Jews used to offer their sacrifices, using the original foundations. Its height will be ninety feet, and its width will be ninety feet.
EZR.6.4	Every three layers of specially prepared stones will be topped by a layer of timber. All expenses will be paid by the royal treasury. 
EZR.6.5	Furthermore, the gold and silver cups, which were taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar from the Temple of God in Jerusalem, must be returned to Jerusalem and put back where they belong. Let them be taken back to the Temple of God.”
EZR.6.6	So King Darius sent this message:
EZR.6.6	“Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province west of the Euphrates River,
EZR.6.7	Do not disturb the construction of the Temple of God. Let it be rebuilt on its original site, and do not hinder the governor of Judah and the elders of the Jews in their work.
EZR.6.8	“Moreover, I hereby decree that you are to help these elders of the Jews as they rebuild this Temple of God. You must pay the full construction costs, without delay, from my taxes collected in the province west of the Euphrates River so that the work will not be interrupted.
EZR.6.9	“Give the priests in Jerusalem whatever is needed in the way of young bulls, rams, and male lambs for the burnt offerings presented to the God of heaven. And without fail, provide them with as much wheat, salt, wine, and olive oil as they need each day. 
EZR.6.10	Then they will be able to offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the welfare of the king and his sons.
EZR.6.11	“Those who violate this decree in any way will have a beam pulled from their house. Then they will be lifted up and impaled on it, and their house will be reduced to a pile of rubble.
EZR.6.12	May the God who has chosen the city of Jerusalem as the place to honor his name destroy any king or nation that violates this command and destroys this Temple.
EZR.6.12	“I, Darius, have issued this decree. Let it be obeyed with all diligence.”
EZR.6.13	Tattenai, governor of the province west of the Euphrates River, and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues complied at once with the command of King Darius. 
EZR.6.14	So the Jewish elders continued their work, and they were greatly encouraged by the preaching of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo. The Temple was finally finished, as had been commanded by the God of Israel and decreed by Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, the kings of Persia. 
EZR.6.15	The Temple was completed on March 12,
EZR.6.16	The Temple of God was then dedicated with great joy by the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the people who had returned from exile. 
EZR.6.17	During the dedication ceremony for the Temple of God, 100 young bulls, 200 rams, and 400 male lambs were sacrificed. And 12 male goats were presented as a sin offering for the twelve tribes of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	Then the priests and Levites were divided into their various divisions to serve at the Temple of God in Jerusalem, as prescribed in the Book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	On April 21
EZR.6.20	The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were ceremonially clean. So they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves. 
EZR.6.21	The Passover meal was eaten by the people of Israel who had returned from exile and by the others in the land who had turned from their corrupt practices to worship the 
EZR.6.22	Then they celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. There was great joy throughout the land because the

EZR.7.3	son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son
EZR.7.4	son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the high priest.
EZR.7.6	This Ezra was a scribe who was well versed in the Law of Moses, which the 
EZR.7.7	Some of the people of Israel, as well as some of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and Temple servants, traveled up to Jerusalem with him in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes’ reign.
EZR.7.8	Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in August
EZR.7.9	He had arranged to leave Babylon on April 8, the first day of the new year,
EZR.7.10	This was because Ezra had determined to study and obey the Law of the 
EZR.7.11	King Artaxerxes had given a copy of the following letter to Ezra, the priest and scribe who studied and taught the commands and decrees of the 
EZR.7.12	“From Artaxerxes, the king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the teacher of the law of the God of heaven. Greetings.
EZR.7.13	“I decree that any of the people of Israel in my kingdom, including the priests and Levites, may volunteer to return to Jerusalem with you. 
EZR.7.14	I and my council of seven hereby instruct you to conduct an inquiry into the situation in Judah and Jerusalem, based on your God’s law, which is in your hand. 
EZR.7.15	We also commission you to take with you silver and gold, which we are freely presenting as an offering to the God of Israel who lives in Jerusalem.
EZR.7.16	“Furthermore, you are to take any silver and gold that you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the voluntary offerings of the people and the priests that are presented for the Temple of their God in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.17	These donations are to be used specifically for the purchase of bulls, rams, male lambs, and the appropriate grain offerings and liquid offerings, all of which will be offered on the altar of the Temple of your God in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	Any silver and gold that is left over may be used in whatever way you and your colleagues feel is the will of your God.
EZR.7.19	“But as for the cups we are entrusting to you for the service of the Temple of your God, deliver them all to the God of Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.20	If you need anything else for your God’s Temple or for any similar needs, you may take it from the royal treasury.
EZR.7.21	“I, Artaxerxes the king, hereby send this decree to all the treasurers in the province west of the Euphrates River
EZR.7.22	You are to give him up to 7,500 pounds
EZR.7.23	Be careful to provide whatever the God of heaven demands for his Temple, for why should we risk bringing God’s anger against the realm of the king and his sons? 
EZR.7.24	I also decree that no priest, Levite, singer, gatekeeper, Temple servant, or other worker in this Temple of God will be required to pay tribute, customs, or tolls of any kind.’
EZR.7.25	“And you, Ezra, are to use the wisdom your God has given you to appoint magistrates and judges who know your God’s laws to govern all the people in the province west of the Euphrates River. Teach the law to anyone who does not know it. 
EZR.7.26	Anyone who refuses to obey the law of your God and the law of the king will be punished immediately, either by death, banishment, confiscation of goods, or imprisonment.”
EZR.7.27	Praise the 
EZR.7.28	And praise him for demonstrating such unfailing love to me by honoring me before the king, his council, and all his mighty nobles! I felt encouraged because the gracious hand of the 
EZR.8.1	Here is a list of the family leaders and the genealogies of those who came with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
EZR.8.2	From the family of Phinehas: Gershom.
EZR.8.2	From the family of Ithamar: Daniel.
EZR.8.2	From the family of David: Hattush, 
EZR.8.3	a descendant of Shecaniah.
EZR.8.3	From the family of Parosh: Zechariah and 150 other men were registered.
EZR.8.4	From the family of Pahath-moab: Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah and 200 other men.
EZR.8.5	From the family of Zattu
EZR.8.6	From the family of Adin: Ebed son of Jonathan and 50 other men.
EZR.8.7	From the family of Elam: Jeshaiah son of Athaliah and 70 other men.
EZR.8.8	From the family of Shephatiah: Zebadiah son of Michael and 80 other men.
EZR.8.9	From the family of Joab: Obadiah son of Jehiel and 218 other men.
EZR.8.10	From the family of Bani
EZR.8.11	From the family of Bebai: Zechariah son of Bebai and 28 other men.
EZR.8.12	From the family of Azgad: Johanan son of Hakkatan and 110 other men.
EZR.8.13	From the family of Adonikam, who came later
EZR.8.14	From the family of Bigvai: Uthai, Zaccur,
EZR.8.15	I assembled the exiles at the Ahava Canal, and we camped there for three days while I went over the lists of the people and the priests who had arrived. I found that not one Levite had volunteered to come along. 
EZR.8.16	So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leaders of the people. I also sent for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of discernment. 
EZR.8.17	I sent them to Iddo, the leader of the Levites at Casiphia, to ask him and his relatives and the Temple servants to send us ministers for the Temple of God at Jerusalem.
EZR.8.18	Since the gracious hand of our God was on us, they sent us a man named Sherebiah, along with eighteen of his sons and brothers. He was a very astute man and a descendant of Mahli, who was a descendant of Levi son of Israel.
EZR.8.19	They also sent Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and twenty of his sons and brothers, 
EZR.8.20	and 220 Temple servants. The Temple servants were assistants to the Levites—a group of Temple workers first instituted by King David and his officials. They were all listed by name.
EZR.8.21	And there by the Ahava Canal, I gave orders for all of us to fast and humble ourselves before our God. We prayed that he would give us a safe journey and protect us, our children, and our goods as we traveled. 
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and earnestly prayed that our God would take care of us, and he heard our prayer.
EZR.8.24	I appointed twelve leaders of the priests—Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten other priests—
EZR.8.25	to be in charge of transporting the silver, the gold, the gold bowls, and the other items that the king, his council, his officials, and all the people of Israel had presented for the Temple of God. 
EZR.8.26	I weighed the treasure as I gave it to them and found the totals to be as follows:
EZR.8.26	24 tons
EZR.8.26	7,500 pounds
EZR.8.26	7,500 pounds of gold,
EZR.8.27	20 gold bowls, equal in value to 1,000 gold coins,
EZR.8.27	2 fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.
EZR.8.28	And I said to these priests, “You and these treasures have been set apart as holy to the 
EZR.8.29	Guard these treasures well until you present them to the leading priests, the Levites, and the leaders of Israel, who will weigh them at the storerooms of the 
EZR.8.30	So the priests and the Levites accepted the task of transporting these treasures of silver and gold to the Temple of our God in Jerusalem.
EZR.8.31	We broke camp at the Ahava Canal on April 19
EZR.8.32	So we arrived safely in Jerusalem, where we rested for three days.
EZR.8.33	On the fourth day after our arrival, the silver, gold, and other valuables were weighed at the Temple of our God and entrusted to Meremoth son of Uriah the priest and to Eleazar son of Phinehas, along with Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui—both of whom were Levites. 
EZR.8.34	Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the total weight was officially recorded.
EZR.8.35	Then the exiles who had come out of captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel. They presented twelve bulls for all the people of Israel, as well as ninety-six rams and seventy-seven male lambs. They also offered twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was given as a burnt offering to the 
EZR.8.36	The king’s decrees were delivered to his highest officers and the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River,
EZR.9.1	When these things had been done, the Jewish leaders came to me and said, “Many of the people of Israel, and even some of the priests and Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the other peoples living in the land. They have taken up the detestable practices of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. 
EZR.9.2	For the men of Israel have married women from these people and have taken them as wives for their sons. So the holy race has become polluted by these mixed marriages. Worse yet, the leaders and officials have led the way in this outrage.”
EZR.9.3	When I heard this, I tore my cloak and my shirt, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down utterly shocked. 
EZR.9.4	Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel came and sat with me because of this outrage committed by the returned exiles. And I sat there utterly appalled until the time of the evening sacrifice.
EZR.9.5	At the time of the sacrifice, I stood up from where I had sat in mourning with my clothes torn. I fell to my knees and lifted my hands to the 
EZR.9.6	I prayed,
EZR.9.6	“O my God, I am utterly ashamed; I blush to lift up my face to you. For our sins are piled higher than our heads, and our guilt has reached to the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	From the days of our ancestors until now, we have been steeped in sin. That is why we and our kings and our priests have been at the mercy of the pagan kings of the land. We have been killed, captured, robbed, and disgraced, just as we are today.
EZR.9.8	“But now we have been given a brief moment of grace, for the 
EZR.9.9	For we were slaves, but in his unfailing love our God did not abandon us in our slavery. Instead, he caused the kings of Persia to treat us favorably. He revived us so we could rebuild the Temple of our God and repair its ruins. He has given us a protective wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	“And now, O our God, what can we say after all of this? For once again we have abandoned your commands! 
EZR.9.11	Your servants the prophets warned us when they said, ‘The land you are entering to possess is totally defiled by the detestable practices of the people living there. From one end to the other, the land is filled with corruption. 
EZR.9.12	Don’t let your daughters marry their sons! Don’t take their daughters as wives for your sons. Don’t ever promote the peace and prosperity of those nations. If you follow these instructions, you will be strong and will enjoy the good things the land produces, and you will leave this prosperity to your children forever.’
EZR.9.13	“Now we are being punished because of our wickedness and our great guilt. But we have actually been punished far less than we deserve, for you, our God, have allowed some of us to survive as a remnant. 
EZR.9.14	But even so, we are again breaking your commands and intermarrying with people who do these detestable things. Won’t your anger be enough to destroy us, so that even this little remnant no longer survives? 
EZR.9.15	O 
EZR.10.1	While Ezra prayed and made this confession, weeping and lying face down on the ground in front of the Temple of God, a very large crowd of people from Israel—men, women, and children—gathered and wept bitterly with him. 
EZR.10.2	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, a descendant of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God, for we have married these pagan women of the land. But in spite of this there is hope for Israel. 
EZR.10.3	Let us now make a covenant with our God to divorce our pagan wives and to send them away with their children. We will follow the advice given by you and by the others who respect the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law of God. 
EZR.10.4	Get up, for it is your duty to tell us how to proceed in setting things straight. We are behind you, so be strong and take action.”
EZR.10.5	So Ezra stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests and the Levites and all the people of Israel swear that they would do as Shecaniah had said. And they all swore a solemn oath. 
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra left the front of the Temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He spent the night
EZR.10.7	Then a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles should come to Jerusalem. 
EZR.10.8	Those who failed to come within three days would, if the leaders and elders so decided, forfeit all their property and be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
EZR.10.9	Within three days, all the people of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. This took place on December 19,
EZR.10.10	Then Ezra the priest stood and said to them: “You have committed a terrible sin. By marrying pagan women, you have increased Israel’s guilt. 
EZR.10.11	So now confess your sin to the 
EZR.10.12	Then the whole assembly raised their voices and answered, “Yes, you are right; we must do as you say!” 
EZR.10.13	Then they added, “This isn’t something that can be done in a day or two, for many of us are involved in this extremely sinful affair. And this is the rainy season, so we cannot stay out here much longer. 
EZR.10.14	Let our leaders act on behalf of us all. Let everyone who has a pagan wife come at a scheduled time, accompanied by the leaders and judges of his city, so that the fierce anger of our God concerning this affair may be turned away from us.”
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this course of action, and they were supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite.
EZR.10.16	So this was the plan they followed. Ezra selected leaders to represent their families, designating each of the representatives by name. On December 29,
EZR.10.17	By March 27, the first day of the new year,
EZR.10.18	These are the priests who had married pagan wives:
EZR.10.18	From the family of Jeshua son of Jehozadak
EZR.10.19	They vowed to divorce their wives, and they each acknowledged their guilt by offering a ram as a guilt offering.
EZR.10.20	From the family of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
EZR.10.21	From the family of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.
EZR.10.22	From the family of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
EZR.10.23	These are the Levites who were guilty: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (also called Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
EZR.10.24	This is the singer who was guilty: Eliashib.
EZR.10.24	These are the gatekeepers who were guilty: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
EZR.10.25	These are the other people of Israel who were guilty:
EZR.10.25	From the family of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malkijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Hashabiah,
EZR.10.26	From the family of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah.
EZR.10.27	From the family of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza.
EZR.10.28	From the family of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
EZR.10.29	From the family of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth.
EZR.10.30	From the family of Pahath-moab: Adna, Kelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh.
EZR.10.31	From the family of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah, Malkijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, 
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
EZR.10.33	From the family of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
EZR.10.34	From the family of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, 
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Keluhi, 
EZR.10.36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 
EZR.10.37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu.
EZR.10.38	From the family of Binnui
EZR.10.39	Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, 
EZR.10.40	Macnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 
EZR.10.41	Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.
EZR.10.43	From the family of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.
EZR.10.44	Each of these men had a pagan wife, and some even had children by these wives.
NEH.1.1	These are the memoirs of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah.
NEH.1.1	In late autumn, in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes’ reign,
NEH.1.2	Hanani, one of my brothers, came to visit me with some other men who had just arrived from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had returned there from captivity and about how things were going in Jerusalem.
NEH.1.3	They said to me, “Things are not going well for those who returned to the province of Judah. They are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem has been torn down, and the gates have been destroyed by fire.”
NEH.1.4	When I heard this, I sat down and wept. In fact, for days I mourned, fasted, and prayed to the God of heaven. 
NEH.1.5	Then I said,
NEH.1.5	“O 
NEH.1.6	listen to my prayer! Look down and see me praying night and day for your people Israel. I confess that we have sinned against you. Yes, even my own family and I have sinned! 
NEH.1.7	We have sinned terribly by not obeying the commands, decrees, and regulations that you gave us through your servant Moses.
NEH.1.8	“Please remember what you told your servant Moses: ‘If you are unfaithful to me, I will scatter you among the nations. 
NEH.1.9	But if you return to me and obey my commands and live by them, then even if you are exiled to the ends of the earth,
NEH.1.10	“The people you rescued by your great power and strong hand are your servants. 
NEH.1.11	O Lord, please hear my prayer! Listen to the prayers of those of us who delight in honoring you. Please grant me success today by making the king favorable to me.
NEH.1.11	In those days I was the king’s cup-bearer.
NEH.2.1	Early the following spring, in the month of Nisan,
NEH.2.2	So the king asked me, “Why are you looking so sad? You don’t look sick to me. You must be deeply troubled.”
NEH.2.2	Then I was terrified, 
NEH.2.3	but I replied, “Long live the king! How can I not be sad? For the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins, and the gates have been destroyed by fire.”
NEH.2.4	The king asked, “Well, how can I help you?”
NEH.2.4	With a prayer to the God of heaven, 
NEH.2.5	I replied, “If it please the king, and if you are pleased with me, your servant, send me to Judah to rebuild the city where my ancestors are buried.”
NEH.2.6	The king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked, “How long will you be gone? When will you return?” After I told him how long I would be gone, the king agreed to my request.
NEH.2.7	I also said to the king, “If it please the king, let me have letters addressed to the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River,
NEH.2.8	And please give me a letter addressed to Asaph, the manager of the king’s forest, instructing him to give me timber. I will need it to make beams for the gates of the Temple fortress, for the city walls, and for a house for myself.” And the king granted these requests, because the gracious hand of God was on me.
NEH.2.9	When I came to the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River, I delivered the king’s letters to them. The king, I should add, had sent along army officers and horsemen
NEH.2.10	But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard of my arrival, they were very displeased that someone had come to help the people of Israel.
NEH.2.11	So I arrived in Jerusalem. Three days later, 
NEH.2.12	I slipped out during the night, taking only a few others with me. I had not told anyone about the plans God had put in my heart for Jerusalem. We took no pack animals with us except the donkey I was riding. 
NEH.2.13	After dark I went out through the Valley Gate, past the Jackal’s Well,
NEH.2.14	Then I went to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but my donkey couldn’t get through the rubble. 
NEH.2.15	So, though it was still dark, I went up the Kidron Valley
NEH.2.16	The city officials did not know I had been out there or what I was doing, for I had not yet said anything to anyone about my plans. I had not yet spoken to the Jewish leaders—the priests, the nobles, the officials, or anyone else in the administration. 
NEH.2.17	But now I said to them, “You know very well what trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire. Let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem and end this disgrace!” 
NEH.2.18	Then I told them about how the gracious hand of God had been on me, and about my conversation with the king.
NEH.2.18	They replied at once, “Yes, let’s rebuild the wall!” So they began the good work.
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard of our plan, they scoffed contemptuously. “What are you doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” they asked.
NEH.2.20	I replied, “The God of heaven will help us succeed. We, his servants, will start rebuilding this wall. But you have no share, legal right, or historic claim in Jerusalem.”
NEH.3.1	Then Eliashib the high priest and the other priests started to rebuild at the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set up its doors, building the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and the Tower of Hananel. 
NEH.3.2	People from the town of Jericho worked next to them, and beyond them was Zaccur son of Imri.
NEH.3.3	The Fish Gate was built by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid the beams, set up its doors, and installed its bolts and bars. 
NEH.3.4	Meremoth son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz repaired the next section of wall. Beside him were Meshullam son of Berekiah and grandson of Meshezabel, and then Zadok son of Baana. 
NEH.3.5	Next were the people from Tekoa, though their leaders refused to work with the construction supervisors.
NEH.3.6	The Old City Gate
NEH.3.7	Next to them were Melatiah from Gibeon, Jadon from Meronoth, people from Gibeon, and people from Mizpah, the headquarters of the governor of the province west of the Euphrates River.
NEH.3.8	Next was Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a goldsmith by trade, who also worked on the wall. Beyond him was Hananiah, a manufacturer of perfumes. They left out a section of Jerusalem as they built the Broad Wall.
NEH.3.9	Rephaiah son of Hur, the leader of half the district of Jerusalem, was next to them on the wall. 
NEH.3.10	Next Jedaiah son of Harumaph repaired the wall across from his own house, and next to him was Hattush son of Hashabneiah. 
NEH.3.11	Then came Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-moab, who repaired another section of the wall and the Tower of the Ovens. 
NEH.3.12	Shallum son of Hallohesh and his daughters repaired the next section. He was the leader of the other half of the district of Jerusalem.
NEH.3.13	The Valley Gate was repaired by the people from Zanoah, led by Hanun. They set up its doors and installed its bolts and bars. They also repaired the 1,500 feet
NEH.3.14	The Dung Gate was repaired by Malkijah son of Recab, the leader of the Beth-hakkerem district. He rebuilt it, set up its doors, and installed its bolts and bars.
NEH.3.15	The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallum
NEH.3.16	Next to him was Nehemiah son of Azbuk, the leader of half the district of Beth-zur. He rebuilt the wall from a place across from the tombs of David’s family as far as the water reservoir and the House of the Warriors.
NEH.3.17	Next to him, repairs were made by a group of Levites working under the supervision of Rehum son of Bani. Then came Hashabiah, the leader of half the district of Keilah, who supervised the building of the wall on behalf of his own district. 
NEH.3.18	Next down the line were his countrymen led by Binnui
NEH.3.19	Next to them, Ezer son of Jeshua, the leader of Mizpah, repaired another section of wall across from the ascent to the armory near the angle in the wall. 
NEH.3.20	Next to him was Baruch son of Zabbai, who zealously repaired an additional section from the angle to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 
NEH.3.21	Meremoth son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz rebuilt another section of the wall extending from the door of Eliashib’s house to the end of the house.
NEH.3.22	The next repairs were made by the priests from the surrounding region. 
NEH.3.23	After them, Benjamin and Hasshub repaired the section across from their house, and Azariah son of Maaseiah and grandson of Ananiah repaired the section across from his house. 
NEH.3.24	Next was Binnui son of Henadad, who rebuilt another section of the wall from Azariah’s house to the angle and the corner. 
NEH.3.25	Palal son of Uzai carried on the work from a point opposite the angle and the tower that projects up from the king’s upper house beside the court of the guard. Next to him were Pedaiah son of Parosh, 
NEH.3.26	with the Temple servants living on the hill of Ophel, who repaired the wall as far as a point across from the Water Gate to the east and the projecting tower. 
NEH.3.27	Then came the people of Tekoa, who repaired another section across from the great projecting tower and over to the wall of Ophel.
NEH.3.28	Above the Horse Gate, the priests repaired the wall. Each one repaired the section immediately across from his own house. 
NEH.3.29	Next Zadok son of Immer also rebuilt the wall across from his own house, and beyond him was Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the gatekeeper of the East Gate. 
NEH.3.30	Next Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section, while Meshullam son of Berekiah rebuilt the wall across from where he lived. 
NEH.3.31	Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, repaired the wall as far as the housing for the Temple servants and merchants, across from the Inspection Gate. Then he continued as far as the upper room at the corner. 
NEH.3.32	The other goldsmiths and merchants repaired the wall from that corner to the Sheep Gate.
NEH.4.1	Sanballat was very angry when he learned that we were rebuilding the wall. He flew into a rage and mocked the Jews, 
NEH.4.2	saying in front of his friends and the Samarian army officers, “What does this bunch of poor, feeble Jews think they’re doing? Do they think they can build the wall in a single day by just offering a few sacrifices?
NEH.4.3	Tobiah the Ammonite, who was standing beside him, remarked, “That stone wall would collapse if even a fox walked along the top of it!”
NEH.4.4	Then I prayed, “Hear us, our God, for we are being mocked. May their scoffing fall back on their own heads, and may they themselves become captives in a foreign land! 
NEH.4.5	Do not ignore their guilt. Do not blot out their sins, for they have provoked you to anger here in front of
NEH.4.6	At last the wall was completed to half its height around the entire city, for the people had worked with enthusiasm.
NEH.4.7	But when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites heard that the work was going ahead and that the gaps in the wall of Jerusalem were being repaired, they were furious. 
NEH.4.8	They all made plans to come and fight against Jerusalem and throw us into confusion. 
NEH.4.9	But we prayed to our God and guarded the city day and night to protect ourselves.
NEH.4.10	Then the people of Judah began to complain, “The workers are getting tired, and there is so much rubble to be moved. We will never be able to build the wall by ourselves.”
NEH.4.11	Meanwhile, our enemies were saying, “Before they know what’s happening, we will swoop down on them and kill them and end their work.”
NEH.4.12	The Jews who lived near the enemy came and told us again and again, “They will come from all directions and attack us!”
NEH.4.13	So I placed armed guards behind the lowest parts of the wall in the exposed areas. I stationed the people to stand guard by families, armed with swords, spears, and bows.
NEH.4.14	Then as I looked over the situation, I called together the nobles and the rest of the people and said to them, “Don’t be afraid of the enemy! Remember the Lord, who is great and glorious, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes!”
NEH.4.15	When our enemies heard that we knew of their plans and that God had frustrated them, we all returned to our work on the wall. 
NEH.4.16	But from then on, only half my men worked while the other half stood guard with spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail. The leaders stationed themselves behind the people of Judah 
NEH.4.17	who were building the wall. The laborers carried on their work with one hand supporting their load and one hand holding a weapon. 
NEH.4.18	All the builders had a sword belted to their side. The trumpeter stayed with me to sound the alarm.
NEH.4.19	Then I explained to the nobles and officials and all the people, “The work is very spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall. 
NEH.4.20	When you hear the blast of the trumpet, rush to wherever it is sounding. Then our God will fight for us!”
NEH.4.21	We worked early and late, from sunrise to sunset. And half the men were always on guard. 
NEH.4.22	I also told everyone living outside the walls to stay in Jerusalem. That way they and their servants could help with guard duty at night and work during the day. 
NEH.4.23	During this time, none of us—not I, nor my relatives, nor my servants, nor the guards who were with me—ever took off our clothes. We carried our weapons with us at all times, even when we went for water.
NEH.5.1	About this time some of the men and their wives raised a cry of protest against their fellow Jews. 
NEH.5.2	They were saying, “We have such large families. We need more food to survive.”
NEH.5.3	Others said, “We have mortgaged our fields, vineyards, and homes to get food during the famine.”
NEH.5.4	And others said, “We have had to borrow money on our fields and vineyards to pay our taxes. 
NEH.5.5	We belong to the same family as those who are wealthy, and our children are just like theirs. Yet we must sell our children into slavery just to get enough money to live. We have already sold some of our daughters, and we are helpless to do anything about it, for our fields and vineyards are already mortgaged to others.”
NEH.5.6	When I heard their complaints, I was very angry. 
NEH.5.7	After thinking it over, I spoke out against these nobles and officials. I told them, “You are hurting your own relatives by charging interest when they borrow money!” Then I called a public meeting to deal with the problem.
NEH.5.8	At the meeting I said to them, “We are doing all we can to redeem our Jewish relatives who have had to sell themselves to pagan foreigners, but you are selling them back into slavery again. How often must we redeem them?” And they had nothing to say in their defense.
NEH.5.9	Then I pressed further, “What you are doing is not right! Should you not walk in the fear of our God in order to avoid being mocked by enemy nations? 
NEH.5.10	I myself, as well as my brothers and my workers, have been lending the people money and grain, but now let us stop this business of charging interest. 
NEH.5.11	You must restore their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and homes to them this very day. And repay the interest you charged when you lent them money, grain, new wine, and olive oil.”
NEH.5.12	They replied, “We will give back everything and demand nothing more from the people. We will do as you say.” Then I called the priests and made the nobles and officials swear to do what they had promised.
NEH.5.13	I shook out the folds of my robe and said, “If you fail to keep your promise, may God shake you like this from your homes and from your property!”
NEH.5.13	The whole assembly responded, “Amen,” and they praised the 
NEH.5.14	For the entire twelve years that I was governor of Judah—from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of the reign of King Artaxerxes
NEH.5.15	The former governors, in contrast, had laid heavy burdens on the people, demanding a daily ration of food and wine, besides forty pieces
NEH.5.16	I also devoted myself to working on the wall and refused to acquire any land. And I required all my servants to spend time working on the wall. 
NEH.5.17	I asked for nothing, even though I regularly fed 150 Jewish officials at my table, besides all the visitors from other lands! 
NEH.5.18	The provisions I paid for each day included one ox, six choice sheep or goats, and a large number of poultry. And every ten days we needed a large supply of all kinds of wine. Yet I refused to claim the governor’s food allowance because the people already carried a heavy burden.
NEH.5.19	Remember, O my God, all that I have done for these people, and bless me for it.
NEH.6.1	Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies found out that I had finished rebuilding the wall and that no gaps remained—though we had not yet set up the doors in the gates. 
NEH.6.2	So Sanballat and Geshem sent a message asking me to meet them at one of the villages
NEH.6.2	But I realized they were plotting to harm me, 
NEH.6.3	so I replied by sending this message to them: “I am engaged in a great work, so I can’t come. Why should I stop working to come and meet with you?”
NEH.6.4	Four times they sent the same message, and each time I gave the same reply. 
NEH.6.5	The fifth time, Sanballat’s servant came with an open letter in his hand, 
NEH.6.6	and this is what it said:
NEH.6.6	“There is a rumor among the surrounding nations, and Geshem
NEH.6.7	He also reports that you have appointed prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim about you, ‘Look! There is a king in Judah!’
NEH.6.7	“You can be very sure that this report will get back to the king, so I suggest that you come and talk it over with me.”
NEH.6.8	I replied, “There is no truth in any part of your story. You are making up the whole thing.”
NEH.6.9	They were just trying to intimidate us, imagining that they could discourage us and stop the work. So I continued the work with even greater determination.
NEH.6.10	Later I went to visit Shemaiah son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel, who was confined to his home. He said, “Let us meet together inside the Temple of God and bolt the doors shut. Your enemies are coming to kill you tonight.”
NEH.6.11	But I replied, “Should someone in my position run from danger? Should someone in my position enter the Temple to save his life? No, I won’t do it!” 
NEH.6.12	I realized that God had not spoken to him, but that he had uttered this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
NEH.6.13	They were hoping to intimidate me and make me sin. Then they would be able to accuse and discredit me.
NEH.6.14	Remember, O my God, all the evil things that Tobiah and Sanballat have done. And remember Noadiah the prophet and all the prophets like her who have tried to intimidate me.
NEH.6.15	So on October 2
NEH.6.16	When our enemies and the surrounding nations heard about it, they were frightened and humiliated. They realized this work had been done with the help of our God.
NEH.6.17	During those fifty-two days, many letters went back and forth between Tobiah and the nobles of Judah. 
NEH.6.18	For many in Judah had sworn allegiance to him because his father-in-law was Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan was married to the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. 
NEH.6.19	They kept telling me about Tobiah’s good deeds, and then they told him everything I said. And Tobiah kept sending threatening letters to intimidate me.
NEH.7.1	After the wall was finished and I had set up the doors in the gates, the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed. 
NEH.7.2	I gave the responsibility of governing Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah, the commander of the fortress, for he was a faithful man who feared God more than most. 
NEH.7.3	I said to them, “Do not leave the gates open during the hottest part of the day.
NEH.7.4	At that time the city was large and spacious, but the population was small, and none of the houses had been rebuilt. 
NEH.7.5	So my God gave me the idea to call together all the nobles and leaders of the city, along with the ordinary citizens, for registration. I had found the genealogical record of those who had first returned to Judah. This is what was written there:
NEH.7.6	Here is the list of the Jewish exiles of the provinces who returned from their captivity. King Nebuchadnezzar had deported them to Babylon, but now they returned to Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah where they originally lived. 
NEH.7.7	Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah,

NEH.7.33	52
NEH.7.34	The citizens of West Elam
NEH.7.34	1,254
NEH.7.35	The citizens of Harim

NEH.7.37	721
NEH.7.38	The citizens of Senaah

NEH.7.39	973
NEH.7.40	The family of Immer
NEH.7.40	1,052
NEH.7.41	The family of Pashhur
NEH.7.41	1,247
NEH.7.42	The family of Harim
NEH.7.42	1,017
NEH.7.43	These are the Levites who returned from exile:
NEH.7.43	The families of Jeshua and Kadmiel (descendants of Hodaviah
NEH.7.43	74
NEH.7.44	The singers of the family of Asaph
NEH.7.44	148
NEH.7.45	The gatekeepers of the families of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai
NEH.7.45	138
NEH.7.46	The descendants of the following Temple servants returned from exile:
NEH.7.46	Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth,
NEH.7.47	Keros, Siaha,
NEH.7.48	Lebanah, Hagabah, Shalmai,
NEH.7.49	Hanan, Giddel, Gahar,
NEH.7.50	Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda,
NEH.7.51	Gazzam, Uzza, Paseah,
NEH.7.52	Besai, Meunim, Nephusim,
NEH.7.53	Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur,
NEH.7.54	Bazluth,
NEH.7.55	Barkos, Sisera, Temah,
NEH.7.56	Neziah, and Hatipha.
NEH.7.57	The descendants of these servants of King Solomon returned from exile:
NEH.7.57	Sotai, Hassophereth, Peruda,
NEH.7.58	Jaalah,
NEH.7.59	Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-hazzebaim, and Ami.
NEH.7.60	In all, the Temple servants and the descendants of Solomon’s servants numbered 392.
NEH.7.61	Another group returned at this time from the towns of Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Kerub, Addan,
NEH.7.62	This group included the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda—a total of 642 people.
NEH.7.63	Three families of priests—Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai—also returned. (This Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of Barzillai of Gilead, and he had taken her family name.) 
NEH.7.64	They searched for their names in the genealogical records, but they were not found, so they were disqualified from serving as priests. 
NEH.7.65	The governor told them not to eat the priests’ share of food from the sacrifices until a priest could consult the 
NEH.7.66	So a total of 42,360 people returned to Judah, 
NEH.7.67	in addition to 7,337 servants and 245 singers, both men and women. 
NEH.7.68	They took with them 736 horses, 245 mules,
NEH.7.69	435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
NEH.7.70	Some of the family leaders gave gifts for the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 gold coins,
NEH.7.71	The other leaders gave to the treasury a total of 20,000 gold coins
NEH.7.72	The rest of the people gave 20,000 gold coins, about 2,500 pounds
NEH.7.73	So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Temple servants, and some of the common people settled near Jerusalem. The rest of the people returned to their own towns throughout Israel.
NEH.8.1	all the people assembled with a unified purpose at the square just inside the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the 
NEH.8.2	So on October 8
NEH.8.3	He faced the square just inside the Water Gate from early morning until noon and read aloud to everyone who could understand. All the people listened closely to the Book of the Law.
NEH.8.4	Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform that had been made for the occasion. To his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah. To his left stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. 
NEH.8.5	Ezra stood on the platform in full view of all the people. When they saw him open the book, they all rose to their feet.
NEH.8.6	Then Ezra praised the 
NEH.8.7	The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah—then instructed the people in the Law while everyone remained in their places. 
NEH.8.8	They read from the Book of the Law of God and clearly explained the meaning of what was being read, helping the people understand each passage.
NEH.8.9	Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were interpreting for the people said to them, “Don’t mourn or weep on such a day as this! For today is a sacred day before the 
NEH.8.10	And Nehemiah
NEH.8.11	And the Levites, too, quieted the people, telling them, “Hush! Don’t weep! For this is a sacred day.” 
NEH.8.12	So the people went away to eat and drink at a festive meal, to share gifts of food, and to celebrate with great joy because they had heard God’s words and understood them.
NEH.8.13	On October 9
NEH.8.14	As they studied the Law, they discovered that the 
NEH.8.15	He had said that a proclamation should be made throughout their towns and in Jerusalem, telling the people to go to the hills to get branches from olive, wild olive,
NEH.8.16	So the people went out and cut branches and used them to build shelters on the roofs of their houses, in their courtyards, in the courtyards of God’s Temple, or in the squares just inside the Water Gate and the Ephraim Gate. 
NEH.8.17	So everyone who had returned from captivity lived in these shelters during the festival, and they were all filled with great joy! The Israelites had not celebrated like this since the days of Joshua
NEH.8.18	Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God on each of the seven days of the festival. Then on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, as was required by law.
NEH.9.1	On October 31
NEH.9.2	Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners as they confessed their own sins and the sins of their ancestors. 
NEH.9.3	They remained standing in place for three hours
NEH.9.4	The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani—stood on the stairway of the Levites and cried out to the 
NEH.9.5	Then the leaders of the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—called out to the people: “Stand up and praise the 
NEH.9.5	“May your glorious name be praised! May it be exalted above all blessing and praise!
NEH.9.6	“You alone are the 
NEH.9.7	“You are the 
NEH.9.8	When he had proved himself faithful, you made a covenant with him to give him and his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites. And you have done what you promised, for you are always true to your word.
NEH.9.9	“You saw the misery of our ancestors in Egypt, and you heard their cries from beside the Red Sea.
NEH.9.10	You displayed miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh, his officials, and all his people, for you knew how arrogantly they were treating our ancestors. You have a glorious reputation that has never been forgotten. 
NEH.9.11	You divided the sea for your people so they could walk through on dry land! And then you hurled their enemies into the depths of the sea. They sank like stones beneath the mighty waters. 
NEH.9.12	You led our ancestors by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night so that they could find their way.
NEH.9.13	“You came down at Mount Sinai and spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and instructions that were just, and decrees and commands that were good. 
NEH.9.14	You instructed them concerning your holy Sabbath. And you commanded them, through Moses your servant, to obey all your commands, decrees, and instructions.
NEH.9.15	“You gave them bread from heaven when they were hungry and water from the rock when they were thirsty. You commanded them to go and take possession of the land you had sworn to give them.
NEH.9.16	“But our ancestors were proud and stubborn, and they paid no attention to your commands. 
NEH.9.17	They refused to obey and did not remember the miracles you had done for them. Instead, they became stubborn and appointed a leader to take them back to their slavery in Egypt.
NEH.9.18	even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, ‘This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!’ They committed terrible blasphemies.
NEH.9.19	“But in your great mercy you did not abandon them to die in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud still led them forward by day, and the pillar of fire showed them the way through the night. 
NEH.9.20	You sent your good Spirit to instruct them, and you did not stop giving them manna from heaven or water for their thirst. 
NEH.9.21	For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell!
NEH.9.22	“Then you helped our ancestors conquer kingdoms and nations, and you placed your people in every corner of the land.
NEH.9.23	You made their descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and brought them into the land you had promised to their ancestors.
NEH.9.24	“They went in and took possession of the land. You subdued whole nations before them. Even the Canaanites, who inhabited the land, were powerless! Your people could deal with these nations and their kings as they pleased. 
NEH.9.25	Our ancestors captured fortified cities and fertile land. They took over houses full of good things, with cisterns already dug and vineyards and olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate until they were full and grew fat and enjoyed themselves in all your blessings.
NEH.9.26	“But despite all this, they were disobedient and rebelled against you. They turned their backs on your Law, they killed your prophets who warned them to return to you, and they committed terrible blasphemies. 
NEH.9.27	So you handed them over to their enemies, who made them suffer. But in their time of trouble they cried to you, and you heard them from heaven. In your great mercy, you sent them liberators who rescued them from their enemies.
NEH.9.28	“But as soon as they were at peace, your people again committed evil in your sight, and once more you let their enemies conquer them. Yet whenever your people turned and cried to you again for help, you listened once more from heaven. In your wonderful mercy, you rescued them many times!
NEH.9.29	“You warned them to return to your Law, but they became proud and obstinate and disobeyed your commands. They did not follow your regulations, by which people will find life if only they obey. They stubbornly turned their backs on you and refused to listen. 
NEH.9.30	In your love, you were patient with them for many years. You sent your Spirit, who warned them through the prophets. But still they wouldn’t listen! So once again you allowed the peoples of the land to conquer them. 
NEH.9.31	But in your great mercy, you did not destroy them completely or abandon them forever. What a gracious and merciful God you are!
NEH.9.32	“And now, our God, the great and mighty and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of unfailing love, do not let all the hardships we have suffered seem insignificant to you. Great trouble has come upon us and upon our kings and leaders and priests and prophets and ancestors—all of your people—from the days when the kings of Assyria first triumphed over us until now. 
NEH.9.33	Every time you punished us you were being just. We have sinned greatly, and you gave us only what we deserved. 
NEH.9.34	Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors did not obey your Law or listen to the warnings in your commands and laws. 
NEH.9.35	Even while they had their own kingdom, they did not serve you, though you showered your goodness on them. You gave them a large, fertile land, but they refused to turn from their wickedness.
NEH.9.36	“So now today we are slaves in the land of plenty that you gave our ancestors for their enjoyment! We are slaves here in this good land. 
NEH.9.37	The lush produce of this land piles up in the hands of the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. They have power over us and our livestock. We serve them at their pleasure, and we are in great misery.”
NEH.9.38	The people responded, “In view of all this,
NEH.10.1	The document was ratified and sealed with the following names:
NEH.10.1	The governor:
NEH.10.1	Nehemiah son of Hacaliah, and also Zedekiah.
NEH.10.2	The following priests:
NEH.10.2	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.10.3	Pashhur, Amariah, Malkijah, 
NEH.10.4	Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, 
NEH.10.5	Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah, 
NEH.10.6	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, 
NEH.10.7	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, 
NEH.10.8	Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah. These were the priests.
NEH.10.9	The following Levites:
NEH.10.9	Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui from the family of Henadad, Kadmiel, 
NEH.10.10	and their fellow Levites: Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, 
NEH.10.11	Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, 
NEH.10.12	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah, 
NEH.10.13	Hodiah, Bani, and Beninu.
NEH.10.14	The following leaders:
NEH.10.14	Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 
NEH.10.15	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, 
NEH.10.16	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 
NEH.10.17	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 
NEH.10.18	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, 
NEH.10.19	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai, 
NEH.10.20	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, 
NEH.10.21	Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,

NEH.10.26	Ahiah, Hanan, Anan, 
NEH.10.27	Malluch, Harim, and Baanah.
NEH.10.28	Then the rest of the people—the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, Temple servants, and all who had separated themselves from the pagan people of the land in order to obey the Law of God, together with their wives, sons, daughters, and all who were old enough to understand—
NEH.10.29	joined their leaders and bound themselves with an oath. They swore a curse on themselves if they failed to obey the Law of God as issued by his servant Moses. They solemnly promised to carefully follow all the commands, regulations, and decrees of the 
NEH.10.30	“We promise not to let our daughters marry the pagan people of the land, and not to let our sons marry their daughters.
NEH.10.31	“We also promise that if the people of the land should bring any merchandise or grain to be sold on the Sabbath or on any other holy day, we will refuse to buy it. Every seventh year we will let our land rest, and we will cancel all debts owed to us.
NEH.10.32	“In addition, we promise to obey the command to pay the annual Temple tax of one-eighth of an ounce of silver
NEH.10.33	This will provide for the Bread of the Presence; for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings; for the offerings on the Sabbaths, the new moon celebrations, and the annual festivals; for the holy offerings; and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel. It will provide for everything necessary for the work of the Temple of our God.
NEH.10.34	“We have cast sacred lots to determine when—at regular times each year—the families of the priests, Levites, and the common people should bring wood to God’s Temple to be burned on the altar of the 
NEH.10.35	“We promise to bring the first part of every harvest to the 
NEH.10.36	We agree to give God our oldest sons and the firstborn of all our herds and flocks, as prescribed in the Law. We will present them to the priests who minister in the Temple of our God. 
NEH.10.37	We will store the produce in the storerooms of the Temple of our God. We will bring the best of our flour and other grain offerings, the best of our fruit, and the best of our new wine and olive oil. And we promise to bring to the Levites a tenth of everything our land produces, for it is the Levites who collect the tithes in all our rural towns.
NEH.10.38	“A priest—a descendant of Aaron—will be with the Levites as they receive these tithes. And a tenth of all that is collected as tithes will be delivered by the Levites to the Temple of our God and placed in the storerooms. 
NEH.10.39	The people and the Levites must bring these offerings of grain, new wine, and olive oil to the storerooms and place them in the sacred containers near the ministering priests, the gatekeepers, and the singers.
NEH.10.39	“We promise together not to neglect the Temple of our God.”
NEH.11.1	The leaders of the people were living in Jerusalem, the holy city. A tenth of the people from the other towns of Judah and Benjamin were chosen by sacred lots to live there, too, while the rest stayed where they were. 
NEH.11.2	And the people commended everyone who volunteered to resettle in Jerusalem.
NEH.11.3	Here is a list of the names of the provincial officials who came to live in Jerusalem. (Most of the people, priests, Levites, Temple servants, and descendants of Solomon’s servants continued to live in their own homes in the various towns of Judah, 
NEH.11.4	but some of the people from Judah and Benjamin resettled in Jerusalem.)
NEH.11.4	From the tribe of Judah:
NEH.11.4	Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mahalalel, of the family of Perez. 
NEH.11.5	Also Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Col-hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of Zechariah, of the family of Shelah.
NEH.11.6	There were 468 descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem—all outstanding men.

NEH.11.7	Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah, son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jeshaiah. 
NEH.11.8	After him were Gabbai and Sallai and a total of 928 relatives. 
NEH.11.9	Their chief officer was Joel son of Zicri, who was assisted by Judah son of Hassenuah, second-in-command over the city.
NEH.11.10	From the priests:
NEH.11.10	Jedaiah son of Joiarib; Jakin; 
NEH.11.11	and Seraiah son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, the supervisor of the Temple of God. 
NEH.11.12	Also 822 of their associates, who worked at the Temple. Also Adaiah son of Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashhur, son of Malkijah, 
NEH.11.13	along with 242 of his associates, who were heads of their families. Also Amashsai son of Azarel, son of Ahzai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer, 
NEH.11.14	and 128 of his
NEH.11.15	From the Levites:
NEH.11.15	Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of Bunni. 
NEH.11.16	Also Shabbethai and Jozabad, who were in charge of the work outside the Temple of God. 
NEH.11.17	Also Mattaniah son of Mica, son of Zabdi, a descendant of Asaph, who led in thanksgiving and prayer. Also Bakbukiah, who was Mattaniah’s assistant, and Abda son of Shammua, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun. 
NEH.11.18	In all, there were 284 Levites in the holy city.
NEH.11.19	From the gatekeepers:
NEH.11.19	Akkub, Talmon, and 172 of their associates, who guarded the gates.
NEH.11.20	The other priests, Levites, and the rest of the Israelites lived wherever their family inheritance was located in any of the towns of Judah. 
NEH.11.21	The Temple servants, however, whose leaders were Ziha and Gishpa, all lived on the hill of Ophel.
NEH.11.22	The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, a descendant of Asaph, whose family served as singers at God’s Temple. 
NEH.11.23	Their daily responsibilities were carried out according to the terms of a royal command.
NEH.11.24	Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, a descendant of Zerah son of Judah, was the royal adviser in all matters of public administration.
NEH.11.25	As for the surrounding villages with their open fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba with its settlements, Dibon with its settlements, and Jekabzeel with its villages. 
NEH.11.26	They also lived in Jeshua, Moladah, Beth-pelet, 
NEH.11.27	Hazar-shual, Beersheba with its settlements, 
NEH.11.28	Ziklag, and Meconah with its settlements. 
NEH.11.29	They also lived in En-rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth, 
NEH.11.30	Zanoah, and Adullam with their surrounding villages. They also lived in Lachish with its nearby fields and Azekah with its surrounding villages. So the people of Judah were living all the way from Beersheba in the south to the valley of Hinnom.
NEH.11.31	Some of the people of Benjamin lived at Geba, Micmash, Aija, and Bethel with its settlements. 
NEH.11.32	They also lived in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 
NEH.11.33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 
NEH.11.34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 
NEH.11.35	Lod, Ono, and the Valley of Craftsmen.
NEH.11.36	Some of the Levites who lived in Judah were sent to live with the tribe of Benjamin.
NEH.12.1	Here is the list of the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the high priest:
NEH.12.1	Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
NEH.12.2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
NEH.12.3	Shecaniah, Harim,
NEH.12.4	Iddo, Ginnethon,
NEH.12.5	Miniamin, Moadiah,
NEH.12.6	Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah.
NEH.12.7	These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Jeshua.
NEH.12.8	The Levites who returned with them were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his associates was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. 
NEH.12.9	Their associates, Bakbukiah and Unni, stood opposite them during the service.
NEH.12.10	Jeshua the high priest was the father of Joiakim.
NEH.12.10	Joiakim was the father of Eliashib.
NEH.12.10	Eliashib was the father of Joiada.
NEH.12.11	Joiada was the father of Johanan.
NEH.12.11	Johanan was the father of Jaddua.
NEH.12.12	Now when Joiakim was high priest, the family leaders of the priests were as follows:
NEH.12.12	Meraiah was leader of the family of Seraiah.
NEH.12.12	Hananiah was leader of the family of Jeremiah.
NEH.12.13	Meshullam was leader of the family of Ezra.
NEH.12.13	Jehohanan was leader of the family of Amariah.
NEH.12.14	Jonathan was leader of the family of Malluch.
NEH.12.14	Joseph was leader of the family of Shecaniah.
NEH.12.15	Adna was leader of the family of Harim.
NEH.12.15	Helkai was leader of the family of Meremoth.
NEH.12.16	Zechariah was leader of the family of Iddo.
NEH.12.16	Meshullam was leader of the family of Ginnethon.
NEH.12.17	Zicri was leader of the family of Abijah.
NEH.12.17	There was also a
NEH.12.17	Piltai was leader of the family of Moadiah.
NEH.12.18	Shammua was leader of the family of Bilgah.
NEH.12.18	Jehonathan was leader of the family of Shemaiah.
NEH.12.19	Mattenai was leader of the family of Joiarib.
NEH.12.19	Uzzi was leader of the family of Jedaiah.
NEH.12.20	Kallai was leader of the family of Sallu.
NEH.12.20	Eber was leader of the family of Amok.
NEH.12.21	Hashabiah was leader of the family of Hilkiah.
NEH.12.21	Nethanel was leader of the family of Jedaiah.
NEH.12.22	A record of the Levite families was kept during the years when Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua served as high priest. Another record of the priests was kept during the reign of Darius the Persian.
NEH.12.23	A record of the heads of the Levite families was kept in 
NEH.12.24	These were the family leaders of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui,
NEH.12.25	This included Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, and Obadiah.
NEH.12.25	Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were the gatekeepers in charge of the storerooms at the gates. 
NEH.12.26	These all served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jehozadak,
NEH.12.27	For the dedication of the new wall of Jerusalem, the Levites throughout the land were asked to come to Jerusalem to assist in the ceremonies. They were to take part in the joyous occasion with their songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps, and lyres. 
NEH.12.28	The singers were brought together from the region around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites. 
NEH.12.29	They also came from Beth-gilgal and the rural areas near Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built their own settlements around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	The priests and Levites first purified themselves; then they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
NEH.12.31	I led the leaders of Judah to the top of the wall and organized two large choirs to give thanks. One of the choirs proceeded southward
NEH.12.32	Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them, 
NEH.12.33	along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah. 
NEH.12.35	Then came some priests who played trumpets, including Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, a descendant of Asaph. 
NEH.12.36	And Zechariah’s colleagues were Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani. They used the musical instruments prescribed by David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe led this procession. 
NEH.12.37	At the Fountain Gate they went straight up the steps on the ascent of the city wall toward the City of David. They passed the house of David and then proceeded to the Water Gate on the east.
NEH.12.38	The second choir giving thanks went northward
NEH.12.39	then past the Ephraim Gate to the Old City Gate,
NEH.12.40	The two choirs that were giving thanks then proceeded to the Temple of God, where they took their places. So did I, together with the group of leaders who were with me. 
NEH.12.41	We went together with the trumpet-playing priests—Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah—
NEH.12.42	and the singers—Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. They played and sang loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah the choir director.
NEH.12.43	Many sacrifices were offered on that joyous day, for God had given the people cause for great joy. The women and children also participated in the celebration, and the joy of the people of Jerusalem could be heard far away.
NEH.12.44	On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the offerings, the first part of the harvest, and the tithes. They were responsible to collect from the fields outside the towns the portions required by the Law for the priests and Levites. For all the people of Judah took joy in the priests and Levites and their work. 
NEH.12.45	They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as commanded by David and his son Solomon, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers. 
NEH.12.46	The custom of having choir directors to lead the choirs in hymns of praise and thanksgiving to God began long ago in the days of David and Asaph. 
NEH.12.47	So now, in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel brought a daily supply of food for the singers, the gatekeepers, and the Levites. The Levites, in turn, gave a portion of what they received to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
NEH.13.1	On that same day, as the Book of Moses was being read to the people, the passage was found that said no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be permitted to enter the assembly of God.
NEH.13.2	For they had not provided the Israelites with food and water in the wilderness. Instead, they hired Balaam to curse them, though our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
NEH.13.3	When this passage of the Law was read, all those of foreign descent were immediately excluded from the assembly.
NEH.13.4	Before this had happened, Eliashib the priest, who had been appointed as supervisor of the storerooms of the Temple of our God and who was also a relative of Tobiah, 
NEH.13.5	had converted a large storage room and placed it at Tobiah’s disposal. The room had previously been used for storing the grain offerings, the frankincense, various articles for the Temple, and the tithes of grain, new wine, and olive oil (which were prescribed for the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers), as well as the offerings for the priests.
NEH.13.6	I was not in Jerusalem at that time, for I had returned to King Artaxerxes of Babylon in the thirty-second year of his reign,
NEH.13.7	When I arrived back in Jerusalem, I learned about Eliashib’s evil deed in providing Tobiah with a room in the courtyards of the Temple of God. 
NEH.13.8	I became very upset and threw all of Tobiah’s belongings out of the room. 
NEH.13.9	Then I demanded that the rooms be purified, and I brought back the articles for God’s Temple, the grain offerings, and the frankincense.
NEH.13.10	I also discovered that the Levites had not been given their prescribed portions of food, so they and the singers who were to conduct the worship services had all returned to work their fields. 
NEH.13.11	I immediately confronted the leaders and demanded, “Why has the Temple of God been neglected?” Then I called all the Levites back again and restored them to their proper duties. 
NEH.13.12	And once more all the people of Judah began bringing their tithes of grain, new wine, and olive oil to the Temple storerooms.
NEH.13.13	I assigned supervisors for the storerooms: Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah, one of the Levites. And I appointed Hanan son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah as their assistant. These men had an excellent reputation, and it was their job to make honest distributions to their fellow Levites.
NEH.13.14	Remember this good deed, O my God, and do not forget all that I have faithfully done for the Temple of my God and its services.
NEH.13.15	In those days I saw men of Judah treading out their winepresses on the Sabbath. They were also bringing in grain, loading it on donkeys, and bringing their wine, grapes, figs, and all sorts of produce to Jerusalem to sell on the Sabbath. So I rebuked them for selling their produce on that day. 
NEH.13.16	Some men from Tyre, who lived in Jerusalem, were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise. They were selling it on the Sabbath to the people of Judah—and in Jerusalem at that!
NEH.13.17	So I confronted the nobles of Judah. “Why are you profaning the Sabbath in this evil way?” I asked. 
NEH.13.18	“Wasn’t it just this sort of thing that your ancestors did that caused our God to bring all this trouble upon us and our city? Now you are bringing even more wrath upon Israel by permitting the Sabbath to be desecrated in this way!”
NEH.13.19	Then I commanded that the gates of Jerusalem should be shut as darkness fell every Friday evening,
NEH.13.20	The merchants and tradesmen with a variety of wares camped outside Jerusalem once or twice. 
NEH.13.21	But I spoke sharply to them and said, “What are you doing out here, camping around the wall? If you do this again, I will arrest you!” And that was the last time they came on the Sabbath. 
NEH.13.22	Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and to guard the gates in order to preserve the holiness of the Sabbath.
NEH.13.22	Remember this good deed also, O my God! Have compassion on me according to your great and unfailing love.
NEH.13.23	About the same time I realized that some of the men of Judah had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 
NEH.13.24	Furthermore, half their children spoke the language of Ashdod or of some other people and could not speak the language of Judah at all. 
NEH.13.25	So I confronted them and called down curses on them. I beat some of them and pulled out their hair. I made them swear in the name of God that they would not let their children intermarry with the pagan people of the land.
NEH.13.26	“Wasn’t this exactly what led King Solomon of Israel into sin?” I demanded. “There was no king from any nation who could compare to him, and God loved him and made him king over all Israel. But even he was led into sin by his foreign wives. 
NEH.13.27	How could you even think of committing this sinful deed and acting unfaithfully toward God by marrying foreign women?”
NEH.13.28	One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest had married a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, so I banished him from my presence.
NEH.13.29	Remember them, O my God, for they have defiled the priesthood and the solemn vows of the priests and Levites.
NEH.13.30	So I purged out everything foreign and assigned tasks to the priests and Levites, making certain that each knew his work. 
NEH.13.31	I also made sure that the supply of wood for the altar and the first portions of the harvest were brought at the proper times.
NEH.13.31	Remember this in my favor, O my God.
EST.1.1	These events happened in the days of King Xerxes,
EST.1.2	At that time Xerxes ruled his empire from his royal throne at the fortress of Susa. 
EST.1.3	In the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. He invited all the military officers of Persia and Media as well as the princes and nobles of the provinces. 
EST.1.4	The celebration lasted 180 days—a tremendous display of the opulent wealth of his empire and the pomp and splendor of his majesty.
EST.1.5	When it was all over, the king gave a banquet for all the people, from the greatest to the least, who were in the fortress of Susa. It lasted for seven days and was held in the courtyard of the palace garden. 
EST.1.6	The courtyard was beautifully decorated with white cotton curtains and blue hangings, which were fastened with white linen cords and purple ribbons to silver rings embedded in marble pillars. Gold and silver couches stood on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones.
EST.1.7	Drinks were served in gold goblets of many designs, and there was an abundance of royal wine, reflecting the king’s generosity. 
EST.1.8	By edict of the king, no limits were placed on the drinking, for the king had instructed all his palace officials to serve each man as much as he wanted.
EST.1.9	At the same time, Queen Vashti gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day of the feast, when King Xerxes was in high spirits because of the wine, he told the seven eunuchs who attended him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas—
EST.1.11	to bring Queen Vashti to him with the royal crown on her head. He wanted the nobles and all the other men to gaze on her beauty, for she was a very beautiful woman. 
EST.1.12	But when they conveyed the king’s order to Queen Vashti, she refused to come. This made the king furious, and he burned with anger.
EST.1.13	He immediately consulted with his wise advisers, who knew all the Persian laws and customs, for he always asked their advice. 
EST.1.14	The names of these men were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan—seven nobles of Persia and Media. They met with the king regularly and held the highest positions in the empire.
EST.1.15	“What must be done to Queen Vashti?” the king demanded. “What penalty does the law provide for a queen who refuses to obey the king’s orders, properly sent through his eunuchs?”
EST.1.16	Memucan answered the king and his nobles, “Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but also every noble and citizen throughout your empire. 
EST.1.17	Women everywhere will begin to despise their husbands when they learn that Queen Vashti has refused to appear before the king. 
EST.1.18	Before this day is out, the wives of all the king’s nobles throughout Persia and Media will hear what the queen did and will start treating their husbands the same way. There will be no end to their contempt and anger.
EST.1.19	“So if it please the king, we suggest that you issue a written decree, a law of the Persians and Medes that cannot be revoked. It should order that Queen Vashti be forever banished from the presence of King Xerxes, and that the king should choose another queen more worthy than she. 
EST.1.20	When this decree is published throughout the king’s vast empire, husbands everywhere, whatever their rank, will receive proper respect from their wives!”
EST.1.21	The king and his nobles thought this made good sense, so he followed Memucan’s counsel. 
EST.1.22	He sent letters to all parts of the empire, to each province in its own script and language, proclaiming that every man should be the ruler of his own home and should say whatever he pleases.
EST.2.1	But after Xerxes’ anger had subsided, he began thinking about Vashti and what she had done and the decree he had made. 
EST.2.2	So his personal attendants suggested, “Let us search the empire to find beautiful young virgins for the king. 
EST.2.3	Let the king appoint agents in each province to bring these beautiful young women into the royal harem at the fortress of Susa. Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the harem, will see that they are all given beauty treatments. 
EST.2.4	After that, the young woman who most pleases the king will be made queen instead of Vashti.” This advice was very appealing to the king, so he put the plan into effect.
EST.2.5	At that time there was a Jewish man in the fortress of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of Jair. He was from the tribe of Benjamin and was a descendant of Kish and Shimei. 
EST.2.6	His family
EST.2.7	This man had a very beautiful and lovely young cousin, Hadassah, who was also called Esther. When her father and mother died, Mordecai adopted her into his family and raised her as his own daughter.
EST.2.8	As a result of the king’s decree, Esther, along with many other young women, was brought to the king’s harem at the fortress of Susa and placed in Hegai’s care. 
EST.2.9	Hegai was very impressed with Esther and treated her kindly. He quickly ordered a special menu for her and provided her with beauty treatments. He also assigned her seven maids specially chosen from the king’s palace, and he moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem.
EST.2.10	Esther had not told anyone of her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had directed her not to do so. 
EST.2.11	Every day Mordecai would take a walk near the courtyard of the harem to find out about Esther and what was happening to her.
EST.2.12	Before each young woman was taken to the king’s bed, she was given the prescribed twelve months of beauty treatments—six months with oil of myrrh, followed by six months with special perfumes and ointments. 
EST.2.13	When it was time for her to go to the king’s palace, she was given her choice of whatever clothing or jewelry she wanted to take from the harem. 
EST.2.14	That evening she was taken to the king’s private rooms, and the next morning she was brought to the second harem,
EST.2.15	Esther was the daughter of Abihail, who was Mordecai’s uncle. (Mordecai had adopted his younger cousin Esther.) When it was Esther’s turn to go to the king, she accepted the advice of Hegai, the eunuch in charge of the harem. She asked for nothing except what he suggested, and she was admired by everyone who saw her.
EST.2.16	Esther was taken to King Xerxes at the royal palace in early winter
EST.2.17	And the king loved Esther more than any of the other young women. He was so delighted with her that he set the royal crown on her head and declared her queen instead of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	To celebrate the occasion, he gave a great banquet in Esther’s honor for all his nobles and officials, declaring a public holiday for the provinces and giving generous gifts to everyone.
EST.2.19	Even after all the young women had been transferred to the second harem
EST.2.20	Esther continued to keep her family background and nationality a secret. She was still following Mordecai’s directions, just as she did when she lived in his home.
EST.2.21	One day as Mordecai was on duty at the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthana
EST.2.22	But Mordecai heard about the plot and gave the information to Queen Esther. She then told the king about it and gave Mordecai credit for the report. 
EST.2.23	When an investigation was made and Mordecai’s story was found to be true, the two men were impaled on a sharpened pole. This was all recorded in 
EST.3.1	Some time later King Xerxes promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite over all the other nobles, making him the most powerful official in the empire. 
EST.3.2	All the king’s officials would bow down before Haman to show him respect whenever he passed by, for so the king had commanded. But Mordecai refused to bow down or show him respect.
EST.3.3	Then the palace officials at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why are you disobeying the king’s command?” 
EST.3.4	They spoke to him day after day, but still he refused to comply with the order. So they spoke to Haman about this to see if he would tolerate Mordecai’s conduct, since Mordecai had told them he was a Jew.
EST.3.5	When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down or show him respect, he was filled with rage. 
EST.3.6	He had learned of Mordecai’s nationality, so he decided it was not enough to lay hands on Mordecai alone. Instead, he looked for a way to destroy all the Jews throughout the entire empire of Xerxes.
EST.3.7	So in the month of April,
EST.3.8	Then Haman approached King Xerxes and said, “There is a certain race of people scattered through all the provinces of your empire who keep themselves separate from everyone else. Their laws are different from those of any other people, and they refuse to obey the laws of the king. So it is not in the king’s interest to let them live. 
EST.3.9	If it please the king, issue a decree that they be destroyed, and I will give 10,000 large sacks
EST.3.10	The king agreed, confirming his decision by removing his signet ring from his finger and giving it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. 
EST.3.11	The king said, “The money and the people are both yours to do with as you see fit.”
EST.3.12	So on April 17
EST.3.13	Dispatches were sent by swift messengers into all the provinces of the empire, giving the order that all Jews—young and old, including women and children—must be killed, slaughtered, and annihilated on a single day. This was scheduled to happen on March 7 of the next year.
EST.3.14	A copy of this decree was to be issued as law in every province and proclaimed to all peoples, so that they would be ready to do their duty on the appointed day. 
EST.3.15	At the king’s command, the decree went out by swift messengers, and it was also proclaimed in the fortress of Susa. Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa fell into confusion.
EST.4.1	When Mordecai learned about all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on burlap and ashes, and went out into the city, crying with a loud and bitter wail. 
EST.4.2	He went as far as the gate of the palace, for no one was allowed to enter the palace gate while wearing clothes of mourning. 
EST.4.3	And as news of the king’s decree reached all the provinces, there was great mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, and wailed, and many people lay in burlap and ashes.
EST.4.4	When Queen Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, she was deeply distressed. She sent clothing to him to replace the burlap, but he refused it. 
EST.4.5	Then Esther sent for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs who had been appointed as her attendant. She ordered him to go to Mordecai and find out what was troubling him and why he was in mourning. 
EST.4.6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the square in front of the palace gate.
EST.4.7	Mordecai told him the whole story, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews. 
EST.4.8	Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the decree issued in Susa that called for the death of all Jews. He asked Hathach to show it to Esther and explain the situation to her. He also asked Hathach to direct her to go to the king to beg for mercy and plead for her people. 
EST.4.9	So Hathach returned to Esther with Mordecai’s message.
EST.4.10	Then Esther told Hathach to go back and relay this message to Mordecai: 
EST.4.11	“All the king’s officials and even the people in the provinces know that anyone who appears before the king in his inner court without being invited is doomed to die unless the king holds out his gold scepter. And the king has not called for me to come to him for thirty days.” 
EST.4.12	So Hathach
EST.4.13	Mordecai sent this reply to Esther: “Don’t think for a moment that because you’re in the palace you will escape when all other Jews are killed. 
EST.4.14	If you keep quiet at a time like this, deliverance and relief for the Jews will arise from some other place, but you and your relatives will die. Who knows if perhaps you were made queen for just such a time as this?”
EST.4.15	Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: 
EST.4.16	“Go and gather together all the Jews of Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will do the same. And then, though it is against the law, I will go in to see the king. If I must die, I must die.” 
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.
EST.5.1	On the third day of the fast, Esther put on her royal robes and entered the inner court of the palace, just across from the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne, facing the entrance. 
EST.5.2	When he saw Queen Esther standing there in the inner court, he welcomed her and held out the gold scepter to her. So Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter.
EST.5.3	Then the king asked her, “What do you want, Queen Esther? What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!”
EST.5.4	And Esther replied, “If it please the king, let the king and Haman come today to a banquet I have prepared for the king.”
EST.5.5	The king turned to his attendants and said, “Tell Haman to come quickly to a banquet, as Esther has requested.” So the king and Haman went to Esther’s banquet.
EST.5.6	And while they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “Now tell me what you really want. What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!”
EST.5.7	Esther replied, “This is my request and deepest wish. 
EST.5.8	If I have found favor with the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my request and do what I ask, please come with Haman tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for you. Then I will explain what this is all about.”
EST.5.9	Haman was a happy man as he left the banquet! But when he saw Mordecai sitting at the palace gate, not standing up or trembling nervously before him, Haman became furious. 
EST.5.10	However, he restrained himself and went on home.
EST.5.10	Then Haman gathered together his friends and Zeresh, his wife, 
EST.5.11	and boasted to them about his great wealth and his many children. He bragged about the honors the king had given him and how he had been promoted over all the other nobles and officials.
EST.5.12	Then Haman added, “And that’s not all! Queen Esther invited only me and the king himself to the banquet she prepared for us. And she has invited me to dine with her and the king again tomorrow!” 
EST.5.13	Then he added, “But this is all worth nothing as long as I see Mordecai the Jew just sitting there at the palace gate.”
EST.5.14	So Haman’s wife, Zeresh, and all his friends suggested, “Set up a sharpened pole that stands seventy-five feet
EST.6.1	That night the king had trouble sleeping, so he ordered an attendant to bring the book of the history of his reign so it could be read to him. 
EST.6.2	In those records he discovered an account of how Mordecai had exposed the plot of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the eunuchs who guarded the door to the king’s private quarters. They had plotted to assassinate King Xerxes.
EST.6.3	“What reward or recognition did we ever give Mordecai for this?” the king asked.
EST.6.3	His attendants replied, “Nothing has been done for him.”
EST.6.4	“Who is that in the outer court?” the king inquired. As it happened, Haman had just arrived in the outer court of the palace to ask the king to impale Mordecai on the pole he had prepared.
EST.6.5	So the attendants replied to the king, “Haman is out in the court.”
EST.6.5	“Bring him in,” the king ordered. 
EST.6.6	So Haman came in, and the king said, “What should I do to honor a man who truly pleases me?”
EST.6.6	Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king wish to honor more than me?” 
EST.6.7	So he replied, “If the king wishes to honor someone, 
EST.6.8	he should bring out one of the king’s own royal robes, as well as a horse that the king himself has ridden—one with a royal emblem on its head. 
EST.6.9	Let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king’s most noble officials. And let him see that the man whom the king wishes to honor is dressed in the king’s robes and led through the city square on the king’s horse. Have the official shout as they go, ‘This is what the king does for someone he wishes to honor!’”
EST.6.10	“Excellent!” the king said to Haman. “Quick! Take the robes and my horse, and do just as you have said for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the gate of the palace. Leave out nothing you have suggested!”
EST.6.11	So Haman took the robes and put them on Mordecai, placed him on the king’s own horse, and led him through the city square, shouting, “This is what the king does for someone he wishes to honor!” 
EST.6.12	Afterward Mordecai returned to the palace gate, but Haman hurried home dejected and completely humiliated.
EST.6.13	When Haman told his wife, Zeresh, and all his friends what had happened, his wise advisers and his wife said, “Since Mordecai—this man who has humiliated you—is of Jewish birth, you will never succeed in your plans against him. It will be fatal to continue opposing him.”
EST.6.14	While they were still talking, the king’s eunuchs arrived and quickly took Haman to the banquet Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther’s banquet. 
EST.7.2	On this second occasion, while they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther, “Tell me what you want, Queen Esther. What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!”
EST.7.3	Queen Esther replied, “If I have found favor with the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my request, I ask that my life and the lives of my people will be spared. 
EST.7.4	For my people and I have been sold to those who would kill, slaughter, and annihilate us. If we had merely been sold as slaves, I could remain quiet, for that would be too trivial a matter to warrant disturbing the king.”
EST.7.5	“Who would do such a thing?” King Xerxes demanded. “Who would be so presumptuous as to touch you?”
EST.7.6	Esther replied, “This wicked Haman is our adversary and our enemy.” Haman grew pale with fright before the king and queen. 
EST.7.7	Then the king jumped to his feet in a rage and went out into the palace garden.
EST.7.7	Haman, however, stayed behind to plead for his life with Queen Esther, for he knew that the king intended to kill him. 
EST.7.8	In despair he fell on the couch where Queen Esther was reclining, just as the king was returning from the palace garden.
EST.7.8	The king exclaimed, “Will he even assault the queen right here in the palace, before my very eyes?” And as soon as the king spoke, his attendants covered Haman’s face, signaling his doom.
EST.7.9	Then Harbona, one of the king’s eunuchs, said, “Haman has set up a sharpened pole that stands seventy-five feet
EST.7.9	“Then impale Haman on it!” the king ordered. 
EST.7.10	So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai, and the king’s anger subsided.
EST.8.1	On that same day King Xerxes gave the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther. Then Mordecai was brought before the king, for Esther had told the king how they were related. 
EST.8.2	The king took off his signet ring—which he had taken back from Haman—and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed Mordecai to be in charge of Haman’s property.
EST.8.3	Then Esther went again before the king, falling down at his feet and begging him with tears to stop the evil plot devised by Haman the Agagite against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	Again the king held out the gold scepter to Esther. So she rose and stood before him.
EST.8.5	Esther said, “If it please the king, and if I have found favor with him, and if he thinks it is right, and if I am pleasing to him, let there be a decree that reverses the orders of Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, who ordered that Jews throughout all the king’s provinces should be destroyed. 
EST.8.6	For how can I endure to see my people and my family slaughtered and destroyed?”
EST.8.7	Then King Xerxes said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “I have given Esther the property of Haman, and he has been impaled on a pole because he tried to destroy the Jews. 
EST.8.8	Now go ahead and send a message to the Jews in the king’s name, telling them whatever you want, and seal it with the king’s signet ring. But remember that whatever has already been written in the king’s name and sealed with his signet ring can never be revoked.”
EST.8.9	So on June 25
EST.8.10	The decree was written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the king’s signet ring. Mordecai sent the dispatches by swift messengers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king’s service.
EST.8.11	The king’s decree gave the Jews in every city authority to unite to defend their lives. They were allowed to kill, slaughter, and annihilate anyone of any nationality or province who might attack them or their children and wives, and to take the property of their enemies. 
EST.8.12	The day chosen for this event throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes was March 7 of the next year.
EST.8.13	A copy of this decree was to be issued as law in every province and proclaimed to all peoples, so that the Jews would be ready to take revenge on their enemies on the appointed day. 
EST.8.14	So urged on by the king’s command, the messengers rode out swiftly on fast horses bred for the king’s service. The same decree was also proclaimed in the fortress of Susa.
EST.8.15	Then Mordecai left the king’s presence, wearing the royal robe of blue and white, the great crown of gold, and an outer cloak of fine linen and purple. And the people of Susa celebrated the new decree. 
EST.8.16	The Jews were filled with joy and gladness and were honored everywhere. 
EST.8.17	In every province and city, wherever the king’s decree arrived, the Jews rejoiced and had a great celebration and declared a public festival and holiday. And many of the people of the land became Jews themselves, for they feared what the Jews might do to them.
EST.9.1	So on March 7
EST.9.2	The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the king’s provinces to attack anyone who tried to harm them. But no one could make a stand against them, for everyone was afraid of them. 
EST.9.3	And all the nobles of the provinces, the highest officers, the governors, and the royal officials helped the Jews for fear of Mordecai. 
EST.9.4	For Mordecai had been promoted in the king’s palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces as he became more and more powerful.
EST.9.5	So the Jews went ahead on the appointed day and struck down their enemies with the sword. They killed and annihilated their enemies and did as they pleased with those who hated them. 
EST.9.6	In the fortress of Susa itself, the Jews killed 500 men. 
EST.9.7	They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha—
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not take any plunder.
EST.9.11	That very day, when the king was informed of the number of people killed in the fortress of Susa, 
EST.9.12	he called for Queen Esther. He said, “The Jews have killed 500 men in the fortress of Susa alone, as well as Haman’s ten sons. If they have done that here, what has happened in the rest of the provinces? But now, what more do you want? It will be granted to you; tell me and I will do it.”
EST.9.13	Esther responded, “If it please the king, give the Jews in Susa permission to do again tomorrow as they have done today, and let the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be impaled on a pole.”
EST.9.14	So the king agreed, and the decree was announced in Susa. And they impaled the bodies of Haman’s ten sons. 
EST.9.15	Then the Jews at Susa gathered together on March 8
EST.9.16	Meanwhile, the other Jews throughout the king’s provinces had gathered together to defend their lives. They gained relief from all their enemies, killing 75,000 of those who hated them. But they did not take any plunder. 
EST.9.17	This was done throughout the provinces on March 7, and on March 8 they rested,
EST.9.18	(The Jews at Susa killed their enemies on March 7 and again on March 8, then rested on March 9,
EST.9.19	So to this day, rural Jews living in remote villages celebrate an annual festival and holiday on the appointed day in late winter,
EST.9.20	Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters to the Jews near and far, throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes, 
EST.9.21	calling on them to celebrate an annual festival on these two days.
EST.9.22	He told them to celebrate these days with feasting and gladness and by giving gifts of food to each other and presents to the poor. This would commemorate a time when the Jews gained relief from their enemies, when their sorrow was turned into gladness and their mourning into joy.
EST.9.23	So the Jews accepted Mordecai’s proposal and adopted this annual custom. 
EST.9.24	Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews, had plotted to crush and destroy them on the date determined by casting lots (the lots were called 
EST.9.25	But when Esther came before the king, he issued a decree causing Haman’s evil plot to backfire, and Haman and his sons were impaled on a sharpened pole. 
EST.9.26	That is why this celebration is called Purim, because it is the ancient word for casting lots.
EST.9.26	So because of Mordecai’s letter and because of what they had experienced, 
EST.9.27	the Jews throughout the realm agreed to inaugurate this tradition and to pass it on to their descendants and to all who became Jews. They declared they would never fail to celebrate these two prescribed days at the appointed time each year. 
EST.9.28	These days would be remembered and kept from generation to generation and celebrated by every family throughout the provinces and cities of the empire. This Festival of Purim would never cease to be celebrated among the Jews, nor would the memory of what happened ever die out among their descendants.
EST.9.29	Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote another letter putting the queen’s full authority behind Mordecai’s letter to establish the Festival of Purim. 
EST.9.30	Letters wishing peace and security were sent to the Jews throughout the 127 provinces of the empire of Xerxes. 
EST.9.31	These letters established the Festival of Purim—an annual celebration of these days at the appointed time, decreed by both Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther. (The people decided to observe this festival, just as they had decided for themselves and their descendants to establish the times of fasting and mourning.) 
EST.9.32	So the command of Esther confirmed the practices of Purim, and it was all written down in the records.
EST.10.1	King Xerxes imposed a tribute throughout his empire, even to the distant coastlands. 
EST.10.2	His great achievements and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king had promoted, are recorded in 
EST.10.3	Mordecai the Jew became the prime minister, with authority next to that of King Xerxes himself. He was very great among the Jews, who held him in high esteem, because he continued to work for the good of his people and to speak up for the welfare of all their descendants.
JOB.1.1	There once was a man named Job who lived in the land of Uz. He was blameless—a man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away from evil. 
JOB.1.2	He had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.1.3	He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He also had many servants. He was, in fact, the richest person in that entire area.
JOB.1.4	Job’s sons would take turns preparing feasts in their homes, and they would also invite their three sisters to celebrate with them. 
JOB.1.5	When these celebrations ended—sometimes after several days—Job would purify his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said to himself, “Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice.
JOB.1.6	One day the members of the heavenly court
JOB.1.7	“Where have you come from?” the 
JOB.1.7	Satan answered the 
JOB.1.8	Then the 
JOB.1.9	Satan replied to the 
JOB.1.10	You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his property. You have made him prosper in everything he does. Look how rich he is! 
JOB.1.11	But reach out and take away everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face!”
JOB.1.12	“All right, you may test him,” the 
JOB.1.13	One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting at the oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.14	a messenger arrived at Job’s home with this news: “Your oxen were plowing, with the donkeys feeding beside them, 
JOB.1.15	when the Sabeans raided us. They stole all the animals and killed all the farmhands. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.16	While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news: “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the shepherds. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.17	While he was still speaking, a third messenger arrived with this news: “Three bands of Chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.18	While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news: “Your sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brother’s home. 
JOB.1.19	Suddenly, a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and hit the house on all sides. The house collapsed, and all your children are dead. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.20	Job stood up and tore his robe in grief. Then he shaved his head and fell to the ground to worship. 
JOB.1.21	He said, 
JOB.1.21	“I came naked from my mother’s womb,
JOB.1.21	and I will be naked when I leave.
JOB.1.21	The 
JOB.1.21	and the 
JOB.1.21	Praise the name of the 
JOB.1.22	In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God.
JOB.2.1	One day the members of the heavenly court
JOB.2.2	“Where have you come from?” the 
JOB.2.2	Satan answered the 
JOB.2.3	Then the 
JOB.2.4	Satan replied to the 
JOB.2.5	But reach out and take away his health, and he will surely curse you to your face!”
JOB.2.6	“All right, do with him as you please,” the 
JOB.2.7	So Satan left the 
JOB.2.8	Job scraped his skin with a piece of broken pottery as he sat among the ashes. 
JOB.2.9	His wife said to him, “Are you still trying to maintain your integrity? Curse God and die.”
JOB.2.10	But Job replied, “You talk like a foolish woman. Should we accept only good things from the hand of God and never anything bad?” So in all this, Job said nothing wrong.
JOB.2.11	When three of Job’s friends heard of the tragedy he had suffered, they got together and traveled from their homes to comfort and console him. Their names were Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. 
JOB.2.12	When they saw Job from a distance, they scarcely recognized him. Wailing loudly, they tore their robes and threw dust into the air over their heads to show their grief. 
JOB.2.13	Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and nights. No one said a word to Job, for they saw that his suffering was too great for words.
JOB.3.1	At last Job spoke, and he cursed the day of his birth. 
JOB.3.2	He said:
JOB.3.3	“Let the day of my birth be erased,
JOB.3.3	and the night I was conceived.
JOB.3.4	Let that day be turned to darkness.
JOB.3.4	Let it be lost even to God on high,
JOB.3.4	and let no light shine on it.
JOB.3.5	Let the darkness and utter gloom claim that day for its own.
JOB.3.5	Let a black cloud overshadow it,
JOB.3.5	and let the darkness terrify it.
JOB.3.6	Let that night be blotted off the calendar,
JOB.3.6	never again to be counted among the days of the year,
JOB.3.6	never again to appear among the months.
JOB.3.7	Let that night be childless.
JOB.3.7	Let it have no joy.
JOB.3.8	Let those who are experts at cursing—
JOB.3.8	whose cursing could rouse Leviathan
JOB.3.8	curse that day.
JOB.3.9	Let its morning stars remain dark.
JOB.3.9	Let it hope for light, but in vain;
JOB.3.9	may it never see the morning light.
JOB.3.10	Curse that day for failing to shut my mother’s womb,
JOB.3.10	for letting me be born to see all this trouble.
JOB.3.11	“Why wasn’t I born dead?
JOB.3.11	Why didn’t I die as I came from the womb?
JOB.3.12	Why was I laid on my mother’s lap?
JOB.3.12	Why did she nurse me at her breasts?
JOB.3.13	Had I died at birth, I would now be at peace.
JOB.3.13	I would be asleep and at rest.
JOB.3.14	I would rest with the world’s kings and prime ministers,
JOB.3.14	whose great buildings now lie in ruins.
JOB.3.15	I would rest with princes, rich in gold,
JOB.3.15	whose palaces were filled with silver.
JOB.3.16	Why wasn’t I buried like a stillborn child,
JOB.3.16	like a baby who never lives to see the light?
JOB.3.17	For in death the wicked cause no trouble,
JOB.3.17	and the weary are at rest.
JOB.3.18	Even captives are at ease in death,
JOB.3.18	with no guards to curse them.
JOB.3.19	Rich and poor are both there,
JOB.3.19	and the slave is free from his master.
JOB.3.20	“Oh, why give light to those in misery,
JOB.3.20	and life to those who are bitter?
JOB.3.21	They long for death, and it won’t come.
JOB.3.21	They search for death more eagerly than for hidden treasure.
JOB.3.22	They’re filled with joy when they finally die,
JOB.3.22	and rejoice when they find the grave.
JOB.3.23	Why is life given to those with no future,
JOB.3.23	those God has surrounded with difficulties?
JOB.3.24	I cannot eat for sighing;
JOB.3.24	my groans pour out like water.
JOB.3.25	What I always feared has happened to me.
JOB.3.25	What I dreaded has come true.
JOB.3.26	I have no peace, no quietness.
JOB.3.26	I have no rest; only trouble comes.”
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied to Job:
JOB.4.2	“Will you be patient and let me say a word?
JOB.4.2	For who could keep from speaking out?
JOB.4.3	“In the past you have encouraged many people;
JOB.4.3	you have strengthened those who were weak.
JOB.4.4	Your words have supported those who were falling;
JOB.4.4	you encouraged those with shaky knees.
JOB.4.5	But now when trouble strikes, you lose heart.
JOB.4.5	You are terrified when it touches you.
JOB.4.6	Doesn’t your reverence for God give you confidence?
JOB.4.6	Doesn’t your life of integrity give you hope?
JOB.4.7	“Stop and think! Do the innocent die?
JOB.4.7	When have the upright been destroyed?
JOB.4.8	My experience shows that those who plant trouble
JOB.4.8	and cultivate evil will harvest the same.
JOB.4.9	A breath from God destroys them.
JOB.4.9	They vanish in a blast of his anger.
JOB.4.10	The lion roars and the wildcat snarls,
JOB.4.10	but the teeth of strong lions will be broken.
JOB.4.11	The fierce lion will starve for lack of prey,
JOB.4.11	and the cubs of the lioness will be scattered.
JOB.4.12	“This truth was given to me in secret,
JOB.4.12	as though whispered in my ear.
JOB.4.13	It came to me in a disturbing vision at night,
JOB.4.13	when people are in a deep sleep.
JOB.4.14	Fear gripped me,
JOB.4.14	and my bones trembled.
JOB.4.15	A spirit
JOB.4.15	and my hair stood on end.
JOB.4.16	The spirit stopped, but I couldn’t see its shape.
JOB.4.16	There was a form before my eyes.
JOB.4.16	In the silence I heard a voice say,
JOB.4.17	‘Can a mortal be innocent before God?
JOB.4.17	Can anyone be pure before the Creator?’
JOB.4.18	“If God does not trust his own angels
JOB.4.18	and has charged his messengers with foolishness,
JOB.4.19	how much less will he trust people made of clay!
JOB.4.19	They are made of dust, crushed as easily as a moth.
JOB.4.20	They are alive in the morning but dead by evening,
JOB.4.20	gone forever without a trace.
JOB.4.21	Their tent-cords are pulled and the tent collapses,
JOB.4.21	and they die in ignorance.
JOB.5.1	“Cry for help, but will anyone answer you?
JOB.5.1	Which of the angels
JOB.5.2	Surely resentment destroys the fool,
JOB.5.2	and jealousy kills the simple.
JOB.5.3	I have seen that fools may be successful for the moment,
JOB.5.3	but then comes sudden disaster.
JOB.5.4	Their children are abandoned far from help;
JOB.5.4	they are crushed in court with no one to defend them.
JOB.5.5	The hungry devour their harvest,
JOB.5.5	even when it is guarded by brambles.
JOB.5.5	The thirsty pant after their wealth.
JOB.5.6	But evil does not spring from the soil,
JOB.5.6	and trouble does not sprout from the earth.
JOB.5.7	People are born for trouble
JOB.5.7	as readily as sparks fly up from a fire.
JOB.5.8	“If I were you, I would go to God
JOB.5.8	and present my case to him.
JOB.5.9	He does great things too marvelous to understand.
JOB.5.9	He performs countless miracles.
JOB.5.10	He gives rain for the earth
JOB.5.10	and water for the fields.
JOB.5.11	He gives prosperity to the poor
JOB.5.11	and protects those who suffer.
JOB.5.12	He frustrates the plans of schemers
JOB.5.12	so the work of their hands will not succeed.
JOB.5.13	He traps the wise in their own cleverness
JOB.5.13	so their cunning schemes are thwarted.
JOB.5.14	They find it is dark in the daytime,
JOB.5.14	and they grope at noon as if it were night.
JOB.5.15	He rescues the poor from the cutting words of the strong,
JOB.5.15	and rescues them from the clutches of the powerful.
JOB.5.16	And so at last the poor have hope,
JOB.5.16	and the snapping jaws of the wicked are shut.
JOB.5.17	“But consider the joy of those corrected by God!
JOB.5.17	Do not despise the discipline of the Almighty when you sin.
JOB.5.18	For though he wounds, he also bandages.
JOB.5.18	He strikes, but his hands also heal.
JOB.5.19	From six disasters he will rescue you;
JOB.5.19	even in the seventh, he will keep you from evil.
JOB.5.20	He will save you from death in time of famine,
JOB.5.20	from the power of the sword in time of war.
JOB.5.21	You will be safe from slander
JOB.5.21	and have no fear when destruction comes.
JOB.5.22	You will laugh at destruction and famine;
JOB.5.22	wild animals will not terrify you.
JOB.5.23	You will be at peace with the stones of the field,
JOB.5.23	and its wild animals will be at peace with you.
JOB.5.24	You will know that your home is safe.
JOB.5.24	When you survey your possessions, nothing will be missing.
JOB.5.25	You will have many children;
JOB.5.25	your descendants will be as plentiful as grass!
JOB.5.26	You will go to the grave at a ripe old age,
JOB.5.26	like a sheaf of grain harvested at the proper time!
JOB.5.27	“We have studied life and found all this to be true.
JOB.5.27	Listen to my counsel, and apply it to yourself.”
JOB.6.1	Then Job spoke again:
JOB.6.2	“If my misery could be weighed
JOB.6.2	and my troubles be put on the scales,
JOB.6.3	they would outweigh all the sands of the sea.
JOB.6.3	That is why I spoke impulsively.
JOB.6.4	For the Almighty has struck me down with his arrows.
JOB.6.4	Their poison infects my spirit.
JOB.6.4	God’s terrors are lined up against me.
JOB.6.5	Don’t I have a right to complain?
JOB.6.5	Don’t wild donkeys bray when they find no grass,
JOB.6.5	and oxen bellow when they have no food?
JOB.6.6	Don’t people complain about unsalted food?
JOB.6.6	Does anyone want the tasteless white of an egg?
JOB.6.7	My appetite disappears when I look at it;
JOB.6.7	I gag at the thought of eating it!
JOB.6.8	“Oh, that I might have my request,
JOB.6.8	that God would grant my desire.
JOB.6.9	I wish he would crush me.
JOB.6.9	I wish he would reach out his hand and kill me.
JOB.6.10	At least I can take comfort in this:
JOB.6.10	Despite the pain,
JOB.6.10	I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	But I don’t have the strength to endure.
JOB.6.11	I have nothing to live for.
JOB.6.12	Do I have the strength of a stone?
JOB.6.12	Is my body made of bronze?
JOB.6.13	No, I am utterly helpless,
JOB.6.13	without any chance of success.
JOB.6.14	“One should be kind to a fainting friend,
JOB.6.14	but you accuse me without any fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	My brothers, you have proved as unreliable as a seasonal brook
JOB.6.15	that overflows its banks in the spring
JOB.6.16	when it is swollen with ice and melting snow.
JOB.6.17	But when the hot weather arrives, the water disappears.
JOB.6.17	The brook vanishes in the heat.
JOB.6.18	The caravans turn aside to be refreshed,
JOB.6.18	but there is nothing to drink, so they die.
JOB.6.19	The caravans from Tema search for this water;
JOB.6.19	the travelers from Sheba hope to find it.
JOB.6.20	They count on it but are disappointed.
JOB.6.20	When they arrive, their hopes are dashed.
JOB.6.21	You, too, have given no help.
JOB.6.21	You have seen my calamity, and you are afraid.
JOB.6.22	But why? Have I ever asked you for a gift?
JOB.6.22	Have I begged for anything of yours for myself?
JOB.6.23	Have I asked you to rescue me from my enemies,
JOB.6.23	or to save me from ruthless people?
JOB.6.24	Teach me, and I will keep quiet.
JOB.6.24	Show me what I have done wrong.
JOB.6.25	Honest words can be painful,
JOB.6.25	but what do your criticisms amount to?
JOB.6.26	Do you think your words are convincing
JOB.6.26	when you disregard my cry of desperation?
JOB.6.27	You would even send an orphan into slavery
JOB.6.27	or sell a friend.
JOB.6.28	Look at me!
JOB.6.28	Would I lie to your face?
JOB.6.29	Stop assuming my guilt,
JOB.6.29	for I have done no wrong.
JOB.6.30	Do you think I am lying?
JOB.6.30	Don’t I know the difference between right and wrong?
JOB.7.1	“Is not all human life a struggle?
JOB.7.1	Our lives are like that of a hired hand,
JOB.7.2	like a worker who longs for the shade,
JOB.7.2	like a servant waiting to be paid.
JOB.7.3	I, too, have been assigned months of futility,
JOB.7.3	long and weary nights of misery.
JOB.7.4	Lying in bed, I think, ‘When will it be morning?’
JOB.7.4	But the night drags on, and I toss till dawn.
JOB.7.5	My body is covered with maggots and scabs.
JOB.7.5	My skin breaks open, oozing with pus.
JOB.7.6	“My days fly faster than a weaver’s shuttle.
JOB.7.6	They end without hope.
JOB.7.7	O God, remember that my life is but a breath,
JOB.7.7	and I will never again feel happiness.
JOB.7.8	You see me now, but not for long.
JOB.7.8	You will look for me, but I will be gone.
JOB.7.9	Just as a cloud dissipates and vanishes,
JOB.7.9	those who die
JOB.7.10	They are gone forever from their home—
JOB.7.10	never to be seen again.
JOB.7.11	“I cannot keep from speaking.
JOB.7.11	I must express my anguish.
JOB.7.11	My bitter soul must complain.
JOB.7.12	Am I a sea monster or a dragon
JOB.7.12	that you must place me under guard?
JOB.7.13	I think, ‘My bed will comfort me,
JOB.7.13	and sleep will ease my misery,’
JOB.7.14	but then you shatter me with dreams
JOB.7.14	and terrify me with visions.
JOB.7.15	I would rather be strangled—
JOB.7.15	rather die than suffer like this.
JOB.7.16	I hate my life and don’t want to go on living.
JOB.7.16	Oh, leave me alone for my few remaining days.
JOB.7.17	“What are people, that you should make so much of us,
JOB.7.17	that you should think of us so often?
JOB.7.18	For you examine us every morning
JOB.7.18	and test us every moment.
JOB.7.19	Why won’t you leave me alone,
JOB.7.19	at least long enough for me to swallow!
JOB.7.20	If I have sinned, what have I done to you,
JOB.7.20	O watcher of all humanity?
JOB.7.20	Why make me your target?
JOB.7.20	Am I a burden to you?
JOB.7.21	Why not just forgive my sin
JOB.7.21	and take away my guilt?
JOB.7.21	For soon I will lie down in the dust and die.
JOB.7.21	When you look for me, I will be gone.”
JOB.8.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied to Job:
JOB.8.2	“How long will you go on like this?
JOB.8.2	You sound like a blustering wind.
JOB.8.3	Does God twist justice?
JOB.8.3	Does the Almighty twist what is right?
JOB.8.4	Your children must have sinned against him,
JOB.8.4	so their punishment was well deserved.
JOB.8.5	But if you pray to God
JOB.8.5	and seek the favor of the Almighty,
JOB.8.6	and if you are pure and live with integrity,
JOB.8.6	he will surely rise up and restore your happy home.
JOB.8.7	And though you started with little,
JOB.8.7	you will end with much.
JOB.8.8	“Just ask the previous generation.
JOB.8.8	Pay attention to the experience of our ancestors.
JOB.8.9	For we were born but yesterday and know nothing.
JOB.8.9	Our days on earth are as fleeting as a shadow.
JOB.8.10	But those who came before us will teach you.
JOB.8.10	They will teach you the wisdom of old.
JOB.8.11	“Can papyrus reeds grow tall without a marsh?
JOB.8.11	Can marsh grass flourish without water?
JOB.8.12	While they are still flowering, not ready to be cut,
JOB.8.12	they begin to wither more quickly than grass.
JOB.8.13	The same happens to all who forget God.
JOB.8.13	The hopes of the godless evaporate.
JOB.8.14	Their confidence hangs by a thread.
JOB.8.14	They are leaning on a spider’s web.
JOB.8.15	They cling to their home for security, but it won’t last.
JOB.8.15	They try to hold it tight, but it will not endure.
JOB.8.16	The godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine,
JOB.8.16	its branches spreading across the garden.
JOB.8.17	Its roots grow down through a pile of stones;
JOB.8.17	it takes hold on a bed of rocks.
JOB.8.18	But when it is uprooted,
JOB.8.18	it’s as though it never existed!
JOB.8.19	That’s the end of its life,
JOB.8.19	and others spring up from the earth to replace it.
JOB.8.20	“But look, God will not reject a person of integrity,
JOB.8.20	nor will he lend a hand to the wicked.
JOB.8.21	He will once again fill your mouth with laughter
JOB.8.21	and your lips with shouts of joy.
JOB.8.22	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,
JOB.8.22	and the home of the wicked will be destroyed.”
JOB.9.1	Then Job spoke again:
JOB.9.2	“Yes, I know all this is true in principle.
JOB.9.2	But how can a person be declared innocent in God’s sight?
JOB.9.3	If someone wanted to take God to court,
JOB.9.3	would it be possible to answer him even once in a thousand times?
JOB.9.4	For God is so wise and so mighty.
JOB.9.4	Who has ever challenged him successfully?
JOB.9.5	“Without warning, he moves the mountains,
JOB.9.5	overturning them in his anger.
JOB.9.6	He shakes the earth from its place,
JOB.9.6	and its foundations tremble.
JOB.9.7	If he commands it, the sun won’t rise
JOB.9.7	and the stars won’t shine.
JOB.9.8	He alone has spread out the heavens
JOB.9.8	and marches on the waves of the sea.
JOB.9.9	He made all the stars—the Bear and Orion,
JOB.9.9	the Pleiades and the constellations of the southern sky.
JOB.9.10	He does great things too marvelous to understand.
JOB.9.10	He performs countless miracles.
JOB.9.11	“Yet when he comes near, I cannot see him.
JOB.9.11	When he moves by, I do not see him go.
JOB.9.12	If he snatches someone in death, who can stop him?
JOB.9.12	Who dares to ask, ‘What are you doing?’
JOB.9.13	And God does not restrain his anger.
JOB.9.13	Even the monsters of the sea
JOB.9.14	“So who am I, that I should try to answer God
JOB.9.14	or even reason with him?
JOB.9.15	Even if I were right, I would have no defense.
JOB.9.15	I could only plead for mercy.
JOB.9.16	And even if I summoned him and he responded,
JOB.9.16	I’m not sure he would listen to me.
JOB.9.17	For he attacks me with a storm
JOB.9.17	and repeatedly wounds me without cause.
JOB.9.18	He will not let me catch my breath,
JOB.9.18	but fills me instead with bitter sorrows.
JOB.9.19	If it’s a question of strength, he’s the strong one.
JOB.9.19	If it’s a matter of justice, who dares to summon him
JOB.9.20	Though I am innocent, my own mouth would pronounce me guilty.
JOB.9.20	Though I am blameless, it
JOB.9.21	“I am innocent,
JOB.9.21	but it makes no difference to me—
JOB.9.21	I despise my life.
JOB.9.22	Innocent or wicked, it is all the same to God.
JOB.9.22	That’s why I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’
JOB.9.23	When a plague
JOB.9.23	he laughs at the death of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The whole earth is in the hands of the wicked,
JOB.9.24	and God blinds the eyes of the judges.
JOB.9.24	If he’s not the one who does it, who is?
JOB.9.25	“My life passes more swiftly than a runner.
JOB.9.25	It flees away without a glimpse of happiness.
JOB.9.26	It disappears like a swift papyrus boat,
JOB.9.26	like an eagle swooping down on its prey.
JOB.9.27	If I decided to forget my complaints,
JOB.9.27	to put away my sad face and be cheerful,
JOB.9.28	I would still dread all the pain,
JOB.9.28	for I know you will not find me innocent, O God.
JOB.9.29	Whatever happens, I will be found guilty.
JOB.9.29	So what’s the use of trying?
JOB.9.30	Even if I were to wash myself with soap
JOB.9.30	and clean my hands with lye,
JOB.9.31	you would plunge me into a muddy ditch,
JOB.9.31	and my own filthy clothing would hate me.
JOB.9.32	“God is not a mortal like me,
JOB.9.32	so I cannot argue with him or take him to trial.
JOB.9.33	If only there were a mediator between us,
JOB.9.33	someone who could bring us together.
JOB.9.34	The mediator could make God stop beating me,
JOB.9.34	and I would no longer live in terror of his punishment.
JOB.9.35	Then I could speak to him without fear,
JOB.9.35	but I cannot do that in my own strength.
JOB.10.1	“I am disgusted with my life.
JOB.10.1	Let me complain freely.
JOB.10.1	My bitter soul must complain.
JOB.10.2	I will say to God, ‘Don’t simply condemn me—
JOB.10.2	tell me the charge you are bringing against me.
JOB.10.3	What do you gain by oppressing me?
JOB.10.3	Why do you reject me, the work of your own hands,
JOB.10.3	while smiling on the schemes of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Are your eyes like those of a human?
JOB.10.4	Do you see things only as people see them?
JOB.10.5	Is your lifetime only as long as ours?
JOB.10.5	Is your life so short
JOB.10.6	that you must quickly probe for my guilt
JOB.10.6	and search for my sin?
JOB.10.7	Although you know I am not guilty,
JOB.10.7	no one can rescue me from your hands.
JOB.10.8	“‘You formed me with your hands; you made me,
JOB.10.8	yet now you completely destroy me.
JOB.10.9	Remember that you made me from dust—
JOB.10.9	will you turn me back to dust so soon?
JOB.10.10	You guided my conception
JOB.10.10	and formed me in the womb.
JOB.10.11	You clothed me with skin and flesh,
JOB.10.11	and you knit my bones and sinews together.
JOB.10.12	You gave me life and showed me your unfailing love.
JOB.10.12	My life was preserved by your care.
JOB.10.13	“‘Yet your real motive—
JOB.10.13	your true intent—
JOB.10.14	was to watch me, and if I sinned,
JOB.10.14	you would not forgive my guilt.
JOB.10.15	If I am guilty, too bad for me;
JOB.10.15	and even if I’m innocent, I can’t hold my head high,
JOB.10.15	because I am filled with shame and misery.
JOB.10.16	And if I hold my head high, you hunt me like a lion
JOB.10.16	and display your awesome power against me.
JOB.10.17	Again and again you witness against me.
JOB.10.17	You pour out your growing anger on me
JOB.10.17	and bring fresh armies against me.
JOB.10.18	“‘Why, then, did you deliver me from my mother’s womb?
JOB.10.18	Why didn’t you let me die at birth?
JOB.10.19	It would be as though I had never existed,
JOB.10.19	going directly from the womb to the grave.
JOB.10.20	I have only a few days left, so leave me alone,
JOB.10.20	that I may have a moment of comfort
JOB.10.21	before I leave—never to return—
JOB.10.21	for the land of darkness and utter gloom.
JOB.10.22	It is a land as dark as midnight,
JOB.10.22	a land of gloom and confusion,
JOB.10.22	where even the light is dark as midnight.’”
JOB.11.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied to Job:
JOB.11.2	“Shouldn’t someone answer this torrent of words?
JOB.11.2	Is a person proved innocent just by a lot of talking?
JOB.11.3	Should I remain silent while you babble on?
JOB.11.3	When you mock God, shouldn’t someone make you ashamed?
JOB.11.4	You claim, ‘My beliefs are pure,’
JOB.11.4	and ‘I am clean in the sight of God.’
JOB.11.5	If only God would speak;
JOB.11.5	if only he would tell you what he thinks!
JOB.11.6	If only he would tell you the secrets of wisdom,
JOB.11.6	for true wisdom is not a simple matter.
JOB.11.6	Listen! God is doubtless punishing you
JOB.11.6	far less than you deserve!
JOB.11.7	“Can you solve the mysteries of God?
JOB.11.7	Can you discover everything about the Almighty?
JOB.11.8	Such knowledge is higher than the heavens—
JOB.11.8	and who are you?
JOB.11.8	It is deeper than the underworld
JOB.11.8	what do you know?
JOB.11.9	It is broader than the earth
JOB.11.9	and wider than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If God comes and puts a person in prison
JOB.11.10	or calls the court to order, who can stop him?
JOB.11.11	For he knows those who are false,
JOB.11.11	and he takes note of all their sins.
JOB.11.12	An empty-headed person won’t become wise
JOB.11.12	any more than a wild donkey can bear a human child.
JOB.11.13	“If only you would prepare your heart
JOB.11.13	and lift up your hands to him in prayer!
JOB.11.14	Get rid of your sins,
JOB.11.14	and leave all iniquity behind you.
JOB.11.15	Then your face will brighten with innocence.
JOB.11.15	You will be strong and free of fear.
JOB.11.16	You will forget your misery;
JOB.11.16	it will be like water flowing away.
JOB.11.17	Your life will be brighter than the noonday.
JOB.11.17	Even darkness will be as bright as morning.
JOB.11.18	Having hope will give you courage.
JOB.11.18	You will be protected and will rest in safety.
JOB.11.19	You will lie down unafraid,
JOB.11.19	and many will look to you for help.
JOB.11.20	But the wicked will be blinded.
JOB.11.20	They will have no escape.
JOB.11.20	Their only hope is death.”
JOB.12.1	Then Job spoke again:
JOB.12.2	“You people really know everything, don’t you?
JOB.12.2	And when you die, wisdom will die with you!
JOB.12.3	Well, I know a few things myself—
JOB.12.3	and you’re no better than I am.
JOB.12.3	Who doesn’t know these things you’ve been saying?
JOB.12.4	Yet my friends laugh at me,
JOB.12.4	for I call on God and expect an answer.
JOB.12.4	I am a just and blameless man,
JOB.12.4	yet they laugh at me.
JOB.12.5	People who are at ease mock those in trouble.
JOB.12.5	They give a push to people who are stumbling.
JOB.12.6	But robbers are left in peace,
JOB.12.6	and those who provoke God live in safety—
JOB.12.6	though God keeps them in his power.
JOB.12.7	“Just ask the animals, and they will teach you.
JOB.12.7	Ask the birds of the sky, and they will tell you.
JOB.12.8	Speak to the earth, and it will instruct you.
JOB.12.8	Let the fish in the sea speak to you.
JOB.12.9	For they all know
JOB.12.9	that my disaster
JOB.12.10	For the life of every living thing is in his hand,
JOB.12.10	and the breath of every human being.
JOB.12.11	The ear tests the words it hears
JOB.12.11	just as the mouth distinguishes between foods.
JOB.12.12	Wisdom belongs to the aged,
JOB.12.12	and understanding to the old.
JOB.12.13	“But true wisdom and power are found in God;
JOB.12.13	counsel and understanding are his.
JOB.12.14	What he destroys cannot be rebuilt.
JOB.12.14	When he puts someone in prison, there is no escape.
JOB.12.15	If he holds back the rain, the earth becomes a desert.
JOB.12.15	If he releases the waters, they flood the earth.
JOB.12.16	Yes, strength and wisdom are his;
JOB.12.16	deceivers and deceived are both in his power.
JOB.12.17	He leads counselors away, stripped of good judgment;
JOB.12.17	wise judges become fools.
JOB.12.18	He removes the royal robe of kings.
JOB.12.18	They are led away with ropes around their waist.
JOB.12.19	He leads priests away, stripped of status;
JOB.12.19	he overthrows those with long years in power.
JOB.12.20	He silences the trusted adviser
JOB.12.20	and removes the insight of the elders.
JOB.12.21	He pours disgrace upon princes
JOB.12.21	and disarms the strong.
JOB.12.22	“He uncovers mysteries hidden in darkness;
JOB.12.22	he brings light to the deepest gloom.
JOB.12.23	He builds up nations, and he destroys them.
JOB.12.23	He expands nations, and he abandons them.
JOB.12.24	He strips kings of understanding
JOB.12.24	and leaves them wandering in a pathless wasteland.
JOB.12.25	They grope in the darkness without a light.
JOB.12.25	He makes them stagger like drunkards.
JOB.13.1	“Look, I have seen all this with my own eyes
JOB.13.1	and heard it with my own ears, and now I understand.
JOB.13.2	I know as much as you do.
JOB.13.2	You are no better than I am.
JOB.13.3	As for me, I would speak directly to the Almighty.
JOB.13.3	I want to argue my case with God himself.
JOB.13.4	As for you, you smear me with lies.
JOB.13.4	As physicians, you are worthless quacks.
JOB.13.5	If only you could be silent!
JOB.13.5	That’s the wisest thing you could do.
JOB.13.6	Listen to my charge;
JOB.13.6	pay attention to my arguments.
JOB.13.7	“Are you defending God with lies?
JOB.13.7	Do you make your dishonest arguments for his sake?
JOB.13.8	Will you slant your testimony in his favor?
JOB.13.8	Will you argue God’s case for him?
JOB.13.9	What will happen when he finds out what you are doing?
JOB.13.9	Can you fool him as easily as you fool people?
JOB.13.10	No, you will be in trouble with him
JOB.13.10	if you secretly slant your testimony in his favor.
JOB.13.11	Doesn’t his majesty terrify you?
JOB.13.11	Doesn’t your fear of him overwhelm you?
JOB.13.12	Your platitudes are as valuable as ashes.
JOB.13.12	Your defense is as fragile as a clay pot.
JOB.13.13	“Be silent now and leave me alone.
JOB.13.13	Let me speak, and I will face the consequences.
JOB.13.14	Why should I put myself in mortal danger
JOB.13.14	and take my life in my own hands?
JOB.13.15	God might kill me, but I have no other hope.
JOB.13.15	I am going to argue my case with him.
JOB.13.16	But this is what will save me—I am not godless.
JOB.13.16	If I were, I could not stand before him.
JOB.13.17	“Listen closely to what I am about to say.
JOB.13.17	Hear me out.
JOB.13.18	I have prepared my case;
JOB.13.18	I will be proved innocent.
JOB.13.19	Who can argue with me over this?
JOB.13.19	And if you prove me wrong, I will remain silent and die.
JOB.13.20	“O God, grant me these two things,
JOB.13.20	and then I will be able to face you.
JOB.13.21	Remove your heavy hand from me,
JOB.13.21	and don’t terrify me with your awesome presence.
JOB.13.22	Now summon me, and I will answer!
JOB.13.22	Or let me speak to you, and you reply.
JOB.13.23	Tell me, what have I done wrong?
JOB.13.23	Show me my rebellion and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Why do you turn away from me?
JOB.13.24	Why do you treat me as your enemy?
JOB.13.25	Would you terrify a leaf blown by the wind?
JOB.13.25	Would you chase dry straw?
JOB.13.26	“You write bitter accusations against me
JOB.13.26	and bring up all the sins of my youth.
JOB.13.27	You put my feet in stocks.
JOB.13.27	You examine all my paths.
JOB.13.27	You trace all my footprints.
JOB.13.28	I waste away like rotting wood,
JOB.13.28	like a moth-eaten coat.
JOB.14.1	“How frail is humanity!
JOB.14.1	How short is life, how full of trouble!
JOB.14.2	We blossom like a flower and then wither.
JOB.14.2	Like a passing shadow, we quickly disappear.
JOB.14.3	Must you keep an eye on such a frail creature
JOB.14.3	and demand an accounting from me?
JOB.14.4	Who can bring purity out of an impure person?
JOB.14.4	No one!
JOB.14.5	You have decided the length of our lives.
JOB.14.5	You know how many months we will live,
JOB.14.5	and we are not given a minute longer.
JOB.14.6	So leave us alone and let us rest!
JOB.14.6	We are like hired hands, so let us finish our work in peace.
JOB.14.7	“Even a tree has more hope!
JOB.14.7	If it is cut down, it will sprout again
JOB.14.7	and grow new branches.
JOB.14.8	Though its roots have grown old in the earth
JOB.14.8	and its stump decays,
JOB.14.9	at the scent of water it will bud
JOB.14.9	and sprout again like a new seedling.
JOB.14.10	“But when people die, their strength is gone.
JOB.14.10	They breathe their last, and then where are they?
JOB.14.11	As water evaporates from a lake
JOB.14.11	and a river disappears in drought,
JOB.14.12	people are laid to rest and do not rise again.
JOB.14.12	Until the heavens are no more, they will not wake up
JOB.14.12	nor be roused from their sleep.
JOB.14.13	“I wish you would hide me in the grave
JOB.14.13	and forget me there until your anger has passed.
JOB.14.13	But mark your calendar to think of me again!
JOB.14.14	Can the dead live again?
JOB.14.14	If so, this would give me hope through all my years of struggle,
JOB.14.14	and I would eagerly await the release of death.
JOB.14.15	You would call and I would answer,
JOB.14.15	and you would yearn for me, your handiwork.
JOB.14.16	For then you would guard my steps,
JOB.14.16	instead of watching for my sins.
JOB.14.17	My sins would be sealed in a pouch,
JOB.14.17	and you would cover my guilt.
JOB.14.18	“But instead, as mountains fall and crumble
JOB.14.18	and as rocks fall from a cliff,
JOB.14.19	as water wears away the stones
JOB.14.19	and floods wash away the soil,
JOB.14.19	so you destroy people’s hope.
JOB.14.20	You always overpower them, and they pass from the scene.
JOB.14.20	You disfigure them in death and send them away.
JOB.14.21	They never know if their children grow up in honor
JOB.14.21	or sink to insignificance.
JOB.14.22	They suffer painfully;
JOB.14.22	their life is full of trouble.”
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
JOB.15.2	“A wise man wouldn’t answer with such empty talk!
JOB.15.2	You are nothing but a windbag.
JOB.15.3	The wise don’t engage in empty chatter.
JOB.15.3	What good are such words?
JOB.15.4	Have you no fear of God,
JOB.15.4	no reverence for him?
JOB.15.5	Your sins are telling your mouth what to say.
JOB.15.5	Your words are based on clever deception.
JOB.15.6	Your own mouth condemns you, not I.
JOB.15.6	Your own lips testify against you.
JOB.15.7	“Were you the first person ever born?
JOB.15.7	Were you born before the hills were made?
JOB.15.8	Were you listening at God’s secret council?
JOB.15.8	Do you have a monopoly on wisdom?
JOB.15.9	What do you know that we don’t?
JOB.15.9	What do you understand that we do not?
JOB.15.10	On our side are aged, gray-haired men
JOB.15.10	much older than your father!
JOB.15.11	“Is God’s comfort too little for you?
JOB.15.11	Is his gentle word not enough?
JOB.15.12	What has taken away your reason?
JOB.15.12	What has weakened your vision,
JOB.15.13	that you turn against God
JOB.15.13	and say all these evil things?
JOB.15.14	Can any mortal be pure?
JOB.15.14	Can anyone born of a woman be just?
JOB.15.15	Look, God does not even trust the angels.
JOB.15.15	Even the heavens are not absolutely pure in his sight.
JOB.15.16	How much less pure is a corrupt and sinful person
JOB.15.16	with a thirst for wickedness!
JOB.15.17	“If you will listen, I will show you.
JOB.15.17	I will answer you from my own experience.
JOB.15.18	And it is confirmed by the reports of wise men
JOB.15.18	who have heard the same thing from their fathers—
JOB.15.19	from those to whom the land was given
JOB.15.19	long before any foreigners arrived.
JOB.15.20	“The wicked writhe in pain throughout their lives.
JOB.15.20	Years of trouble are stored up for the ruthless.
JOB.15.21	The sound of terror rings in their ears,
JOB.15.21	and even on good days they fear the attack of the destroyer.
JOB.15.22	They dare not go out into the darkness
JOB.15.22	for fear they will be murdered.
JOB.15.23	They wander around, saying, ‘Where can I find bread?’
JOB.15.23	They know their day of destruction is near.
JOB.15.24	That dark day terrifies them.
JOB.15.24	They live in distress and anguish,
JOB.15.24	like a king preparing for battle.
JOB.15.25	For they shake their fists at God,
JOB.15.25	defying the Almighty.
JOB.15.26	Holding their strong shields,
JOB.15.26	they defiantly charge against him.
JOB.15.27	“These wicked people are heavy and prosperous;
JOB.15.27	their waists bulge with fat.
JOB.15.28	But their cities will be ruined.
JOB.15.28	They will live in abandoned houses
JOB.15.28	that are ready to tumble down.
JOB.15.29	Their riches will not last,
JOB.15.29	and their wealth will not endure.
JOB.15.29	Their possessions will no longer spread across the horizon.
JOB.15.30	“They will not escape the darkness.
JOB.15.30	The burning sun will wither their shoots,
JOB.15.30	and the breath of God will destroy them.
JOB.15.31	Let them no longer fool themselves by trusting in empty riches,
JOB.15.31	for emptiness will be their only reward.
JOB.15.32	They will be cut down in the prime of life;
JOB.15.32	their branches will never again be green.
JOB.15.33	They will be like a vine whose grapes are harvested too early,
JOB.15.33	like an olive tree that loses its blossoms before the fruit can form.
JOB.15.34	For the godless are barren.
JOB.15.34	Their homes, enriched through bribery, will burn.
JOB.15.35	They conceive trouble and give birth to evil.
JOB.15.35	Their womb produces deceit.”
JOB.16.1	Then Job spoke again:
JOB.16.2	“I have heard all this before.
JOB.16.2	What miserable comforters you are!
JOB.16.3	Won’t you ever stop blowing hot air?
JOB.16.3	What makes you keep on talking?
JOB.16.4	I could say the same things if you were in my place.
JOB.16.4	I could spout off criticism and shake my head at you.
JOB.16.5	But if it were me, I would encourage you.
JOB.16.5	I would try to take away your grief.
JOB.16.6	Instead, I suffer if I defend myself,
JOB.16.6	and I suffer no less if I refuse to speak.
JOB.16.7	“O God, you have ground me down
JOB.16.7	and devastated my family.
JOB.16.8	As if to prove I have sinned, you’ve reduced me to skin and bones.
JOB.16.8	My gaunt flesh testifies against me.
JOB.16.9	God hates me and angrily tears me apart.
JOB.16.9	He snaps his teeth at me
JOB.16.9	and pierces me with his eyes.
JOB.16.10	People jeer and laugh at me.
JOB.16.10	They slap my cheek in contempt.
JOB.16.10	A mob gathers against me.
JOB.16.11	God has handed me over to sinners.
JOB.16.11	He has tossed me into the hands of the wicked.
JOB.16.12	“I was living quietly until he shattered me.
JOB.16.12	He took me by the neck and broke me in pieces.
JOB.16.12	Then he set me up as his target,
JOB.16.13	and now his archers surround me.
JOB.16.13	His arrows pierce me without mercy.
JOB.16.13	The ground is wet with my blood.
JOB.16.14	Again and again he smashes against me,
JOB.16.14	charging at me like a warrior.
JOB.16.15	I wear burlap to show my grief.
JOB.16.15	My pride lies in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My eyes are red with weeping;
JOB.16.16	dark shadows circle my eyes.
JOB.16.17	Yet I have done no wrong,
JOB.16.17	and my prayer is pure.
JOB.16.18	“O earth, do not conceal my blood.
JOB.16.18	Let it cry out on my behalf.
JOB.16.19	Even now my witness is in heaven.
JOB.16.19	My advocate is there on high.
JOB.16.20	My friends scorn me,
JOB.16.20	but I pour out my tears to God.
JOB.16.21	I need someone to mediate between God and me,
JOB.16.21	as a person mediates between friends.
JOB.16.22	For soon I must go down that road
JOB.16.22	from which I will never return.
JOB.17.1	“My spirit is crushed,
JOB.17.1	and my life is nearly snuffed out.
JOB.17.1	The grave is ready to receive me.
JOB.17.2	I am surrounded by mockers.
JOB.17.2	I watch how bitterly they taunt me.
JOB.17.3	“You must defend my innocence, O God,
JOB.17.3	since no one else will stand up for me.
JOB.17.4	You have closed their minds to understanding,
JOB.17.4	but do not let them triumph.
JOB.17.5	They betray their friends for their own advantage,
JOB.17.5	so let their children faint with hunger.
JOB.17.6	“God has made a mockery of me among the people;
JOB.17.6	they spit in my face.
JOB.17.7	My eyes are swollen with weeping,
JOB.17.7	and I am but a shadow of my former self.
JOB.17.8	The virtuous are horrified when they see me.
JOB.17.8	The innocent rise up against the ungodly.
JOB.17.9	The righteous keep moving forward,
JOB.17.9	and those with clean hands become stronger and stronger.
JOB.17.10	“As for all of you, come back with a better argument,
JOB.17.10	though I still won’t find a wise man among you.
JOB.17.11	My days are over.
JOB.17.11	My hopes have disappeared.
JOB.17.11	My heart’s desires are broken.
JOB.17.12	These men say that night is day;
JOB.17.12	they claim that the darkness is light.
JOB.17.13	What if I go to the grave
JOB.17.13	and make my bed in darkness?
JOB.17.14	What if I call the grave my father,
JOB.17.14	and the maggot my mother or my sister?
JOB.17.15	Where then is my hope?
JOB.17.15	Can anyone find it?
JOB.17.16	No, my hope will go down with me to the grave.
JOB.17.16	We will rest together in the dust!”
JOB.18.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
JOB.18.2	“How long before you stop talking?
JOB.18.2	Speak sense if you want us to answer!
JOB.18.3	Do you think we are mere animals?
JOB.18.3	Do you think we are stupid?
JOB.18.4	You may tear out your hair in anger,
JOB.18.4	but will that destroy the earth?
JOB.18.4	Will it make the rocks tremble?
JOB.18.5	“Surely the light of the wicked will be snuffed out.
JOB.18.5	The sparks of their fire will not glow.
JOB.18.6	The light in their tent will grow dark.
JOB.18.6	The lamp hanging above them will be quenched.
JOB.18.7	The confident stride of the wicked will be shortened.
JOB.18.7	Their own schemes will be their downfall.
JOB.18.8	The wicked walk into a net.
JOB.18.8	They fall into a pit.
JOB.18.9	A trap grabs them by the heel.
JOB.18.9	A snare holds them tight.
JOB.18.10	A noose lies hidden on the ground.
JOB.18.10	A rope is stretched across their path.
JOB.18.11	“Terrors surround the wicked
JOB.18.11	and trouble them at every step.
JOB.18.12	Hunger depletes their strength,
JOB.18.12	and calamity waits for them to stumble.
JOB.18.13	Disease eats their skin;
JOB.18.13	death devours their limbs.
JOB.18.14	They are torn from the security of their homes
JOB.18.14	and are brought down to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	The homes of the wicked will burn down;
JOB.18.15	burning sulfur rains on their houses.
JOB.18.16	Their roots will dry up,
JOB.18.16	and their branches will wither.
JOB.18.17	All memory of their existence will fade from the earth;
JOB.18.17	no one will remember their names.
JOB.18.18	They will be thrust from light into darkness,
JOB.18.18	driven from the world.
JOB.18.19	They will have neither children nor grandchildren,
JOB.18.19	nor any survivor in the place where they lived.
JOB.18.20	People in the west are appalled at their fate;
JOB.18.20	people in the east are horrified.
JOB.18.21	They will say, ‘This was the home of a wicked person,
JOB.18.21	the place of one who rejected God.’”
JOB.19.1	Then Job spoke again:
JOB.19.2	“How long will you torture me?
JOB.19.2	How long will you try to crush me with your words?
JOB.19.3	You have already insulted me ten times.
JOB.19.3	You should be ashamed of treating me so badly.
JOB.19.4	Even if I have sinned,
JOB.19.4	that is my concern, not yours.
JOB.19.5	You think you’re better than I am,
JOB.19.5	using my humiliation as evidence of my sin.
JOB.19.6	But it is God who has wronged me,
JOB.19.6	capturing me in his net.
JOB.19.7	“I cry out, ‘Help!’ but no one answers me.
JOB.19.7	I protest, but there is no justice.
JOB.19.8	God has blocked my way so I cannot move.
JOB.19.8	He has plunged my path into darkness.
JOB.19.9	He has stripped me of my honor
JOB.19.9	and removed the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He has demolished me on every side, and I am finished.
JOB.19.10	He has uprooted my hope like a fallen tree.
JOB.19.11	His fury burns against me;
JOB.19.11	he counts me as an enemy.
JOB.19.12	His troops advance.
JOB.19.12	They build up roads to attack me.
JOB.19.12	They camp all around my tent.
JOB.19.13	“My relatives stay far away,
JOB.19.13	and my friends have turned against me.
JOB.19.14	My family is gone,
JOB.19.14	and my close friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	My servants and maids consider me a stranger.
JOB.19.15	I am like a foreigner to them.
JOB.19.16	When I call my servant, he doesn’t come;
JOB.19.16	I have to plead with him!
JOB.19.17	My breath is repulsive to my wife.
JOB.19.17	I am rejected by my own family.
JOB.19.18	Even young children despise me.
JOB.19.18	When I stand to speak, they turn their backs on me.
JOB.19.19	My close friends detest me.
JOB.19.19	Those I loved have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	I have been reduced to skin and bones
JOB.19.20	and have escaped death by the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	“Have mercy on me, my friends, have mercy,
JOB.19.21	for the hand of God has struck me.
JOB.19.22	Must you also persecute me, like God does?
JOB.19.22	Haven’t you chewed me up enough?
JOB.19.23	“Oh, that my words could be recorded.
JOB.19.23	Oh, that they could be inscribed on a monument,
JOB.19.24	carved with an iron chisel and filled with lead,
JOB.19.24	engraved forever in the rock.
JOB.19.25	“But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,
JOB.19.25	and he will stand upon the earth at last.
JOB.19.26	And after my body has decayed,
JOB.19.26	yet in my body I will see God!
JOB.19.27	I will see him for myself.
JOB.19.27	Yes, I will see him with my own eyes.
JOB.19.27	I am overwhelmed at the thought!
JOB.19.28	“How dare you go on persecuting me,
JOB.19.28	saying, ‘It’s his own fault’?
JOB.19.29	You should fear punishment yourselves,
JOB.19.29	for your attitude deserves punishment.
JOB.19.29	Then you will know that there is indeed a judgment.”
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
JOB.20.2	“I must reply
JOB.20.2	because I am greatly disturbed.
JOB.20.3	I’ve had to endure your insults,
JOB.20.3	but now my spirit prompts me to reply.
JOB.20.4	“Don’t you realize that from the beginning of time,
JOB.20.4	ever since people were first placed on the earth,
JOB.20.5	the triumph of the wicked has been short lived
JOB.20.5	and the joy of the godless has been only temporary?
JOB.20.6	Though the pride of the godless reaches to the heavens
JOB.20.6	and their heads touch the clouds,
JOB.20.7	yet they will vanish forever,
JOB.20.7	thrown away like their own dung.
JOB.20.7	Those who knew them will ask,
JOB.20.7	‘Where are they?’
JOB.20.8	They will fade like a dream and not be found.
JOB.20.8	They will vanish like a vision in the night.
JOB.20.9	Those who once saw them will see them no more.
JOB.20.9	Their families will never see them again.
JOB.20.10	Their children will beg from the poor,
JOB.20.10	for they must give back their stolen riches.
JOB.20.11	Though they are young,
JOB.20.11	their bones will lie in the dust.
JOB.20.12	“They enjoyed the sweet taste of wickedness,
JOB.20.12	letting it melt under their tongue.
JOB.20.13	They savored it,
JOB.20.13	holding it long in their mouths.
JOB.20.14	But suddenly the food in their bellies turns sour,
JOB.20.14	a poisonous venom in their stomach.
JOB.20.15	They will vomit the wealth they swallowed.
JOB.20.15	God won’t let them keep it down.
JOB.20.16	They will suck the poison of cobras.
JOB.20.16	The viper will kill them.
JOB.20.17	They will never again enjoy streams of olive oil
JOB.20.17	or rivers of milk and honey.
JOB.20.18	They will give back everything they worked for.
JOB.20.18	Their wealth will bring them no joy.
JOB.20.19	For they oppressed the poor and left them destitute.
JOB.20.19	They foreclosed on their homes.
JOB.20.20	They were always greedy and never satisfied.
JOB.20.20	Nothing remains of all the things they dreamed about.
JOB.20.21	Nothing is left after they finish gorging themselves.
JOB.20.21	Therefore, their prosperity will not endure.
JOB.20.22	“In the midst of plenty, they will run into trouble
JOB.20.22	and be overcome by misery.
JOB.20.23	May God give them a bellyful of trouble.
JOB.20.23	May God rain down his anger upon them.
JOB.20.24	When they try to escape an iron weapon,
JOB.20.24	a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce them.
JOB.20.25	The arrow is pulled from their back,
JOB.20.25	and the arrowhead glistens with blood.
JOB.20.25	The terrors of death are upon them.
JOB.20.26	Their treasures will be thrown into deepest darkness.
JOB.20.26	A wildfire will devour their goods,
JOB.20.26	consuming all they have left.
JOB.20.27	The heavens will reveal their guilt,
JOB.20.27	and the earth will testify against them.
JOB.20.28	A flood will sweep away their house.
JOB.20.28	God’s anger will descend on them in torrents.
JOB.20.29	This is the reward that God gives the wicked.
JOB.20.29	It is the inheritance decreed by God.”
JOB.21.1	Then Job spoke again:
JOB.21.2	“Listen closely to what I am saying.
JOB.21.2	That’s one consolation you can give me.
JOB.21.3	Bear with me, and let me speak.
JOB.21.3	After I have spoken, you may resume mocking me.
JOB.21.4	“My complaint is with God, not with people.
JOB.21.4	I have good reason to be so impatient.
JOB.21.5	Look at me and be stunned.
JOB.21.5	Put your hand over your mouth in shock.
JOB.21.6	When I think about what I am saying, I shudder.
JOB.21.6	My body trembles.
JOB.21.7	“Why do the wicked prosper,
JOB.21.7	growing old and powerful?
JOB.21.8	They live to see their children grow up and settle down,
JOB.21.8	and they enjoy their grandchildren.
JOB.21.9	Their homes are safe from every fear,
JOB.21.9	and God does not punish them.
JOB.21.10	Their bulls never fail to breed.
JOB.21.10	Their cows bear calves and never miscarry.
JOB.21.11	They let their children frisk about like lambs.
JOB.21.11	Their little ones skip and dance.
JOB.21.12	They sing with tambourine and harp.
JOB.21.12	They celebrate to the sound of the flute.
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in prosperity,
JOB.21.13	then go down to the grave
JOB.21.14	And yet they say to God, ‘Go away.
JOB.21.14	We want no part of you and your ways.
JOB.21.15	Who is the Almighty, and why should we obey him?
JOB.21.15	What good will it do us to pray?’
JOB.21.16	(They think their prosperity is of their own doing,
JOB.21.16	but I will have nothing to do with that kind of thinking.)
JOB.21.17	“Yet the light of the wicked never seems to be extinguished.
JOB.21.17	Do they ever have trouble?
JOB.21.17	Does God distribute sorrows to them in anger?
JOB.21.18	Are they driven before the wind like straw?
JOB.21.18	Are they carried away by the storm like chaff?
JOB.21.18	Not at all!
JOB.21.19	“‘Well,’ you say, ‘at least God will punish their children!’
JOB.21.19	But I say he should punish the ones who sin,
JOB.21.19	so that they understand his judgment.
JOB.21.20	Let them see their destruction with their own eyes.
JOB.21.20	Let them drink deeply of the anger of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For they will not care what happens to their family
JOB.21.21	after they are dead.
JOB.21.22	“But who can teach a lesson to God,
JOB.21.22	since he judges even the most powerful?
JOB.21.23	One person dies in prosperity,
JOB.21.23	completely comfortable and secure,
JOB.21.24	the picture of good health,
JOB.21.24	vigorous and fit.
JOB.21.25	Another person dies in bitter poverty,
JOB.21.25	never having tasted the good life.
JOB.21.26	But both are buried in the same dust,
JOB.21.26	both eaten by the same maggots.
JOB.21.27	“Look, I know what you’re thinking.
JOB.21.27	I know the schemes you plot against me.
JOB.21.28	You will tell me of rich and wicked people
JOB.21.28	whose houses have vanished because of their sins.
JOB.21.29	But ask those who have been around,
JOB.21.29	and they will tell you the truth.
JOB.21.30	Evil people are spared in times of calamity
JOB.21.30	and are allowed to escape disaster.
JOB.21.31	No one criticizes them openly
JOB.21.31	or pays them back for what they have done.
JOB.21.32	When they are carried to the grave,
JOB.21.32	an honor guard keeps watch at their tomb.
JOB.21.33	A great funeral procession goes to the cemetery.
JOB.21.33	Many pay their respects as the body is laid to rest,
JOB.21.33	and the earth gives sweet repose.
JOB.21.34	“How can your empty clichés comfort me?
JOB.21.34	All your explanations are lies!”
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
JOB.22.2	“Can a person do anything to help God?
JOB.22.2	Can even a wise person be helpful to him?
JOB.22.3	Is it any advantage to the Almighty if you are righteous?
JOB.22.3	Would it be any gain to him if you were perfect?
JOB.22.4	Is it because you’re so pious that he accuses you
JOB.22.4	and brings judgment against you?
JOB.22.5	No, it’s because of your wickedness!
JOB.22.5	There’s no limit to your sins.
JOB.22.6	“For example, you must have lent money to your friend
JOB.22.6	and demanded clothing as security.
JOB.22.6	Yes, you stripped him to the bone.
JOB.22.7	You must have refused water for the thirsty
JOB.22.7	and food for the hungry.
JOB.22.8	You probably think the land belongs to the powerful
JOB.22.8	and only the privileged have a right to it!
JOB.22.9	You must have sent widows away empty-handed
JOB.22.9	and crushed the hopes of orphans.
JOB.22.10	That is why you are surrounded by traps
JOB.22.10	and tremble from sudden fears.
JOB.22.11	That is why you cannot see in the darkness,
JOB.22.11	and waves of water cover you.
JOB.22.12	“God is so great—higher than the heavens,
JOB.22.12	higher than the farthest stars.
JOB.22.13	But you reply, ‘That’s why God can’t see what I am doing!
JOB.22.13	How can he judge through the thick darkness?
JOB.22.14	For thick clouds swirl about him, and he cannot see us.
JOB.22.14	He is way up there, walking on the vault of heaven.’
JOB.22.15	“Will you continue on the old paths
JOB.22.15	where evil people have walked?
JOB.22.16	They were snatched away in the prime of life,
JOB.22.16	the foundations of their lives washed away.
JOB.22.17	For they said to God, ‘Leave us alone!
JOB.22.17	What can the Almighty do to us?’
JOB.22.18	Yet he was the one who filled their homes with good things,
JOB.22.18	so I will have nothing to do with that kind of thinking.
JOB.22.19	“The righteous will be happy to see the wicked destroyed,
JOB.22.19	and the innocent will laugh in contempt.
JOB.22.20	They will say, ‘See how our enemies have been destroyed.
JOB.22.20	The last of them have been consumed in the fire.’
JOB.22.21	“Submit to God, and you will have peace;
JOB.22.21	then things will go well for you.
JOB.22.22	Listen to his instructions,
JOB.22.22	and store them in your heart.
JOB.22.23	If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored—
JOB.22.23	so clean up your life.
JOB.22.24	If you give up your lust for money
JOB.22.24	and throw your precious gold into the river,
JOB.22.25	the Almighty himself will be your treasure.
JOB.22.25	He will be your precious silver!
JOB.22.26	“Then you will take delight in the Almighty
JOB.22.26	and look up to God.
JOB.22.27	You will pray to him, and he will hear you,
JOB.22.27	and you will fulfill your vows to him.
JOB.22.28	You will succeed in whatever you choose to do,
JOB.22.28	and light will shine on the road ahead of you.
JOB.22.29	If people are in trouble and you say, ‘Help them,’
JOB.22.29	God will save them.
JOB.22.30	Even sinners will be rescued;
JOB.22.30	they will be rescued because your hands are pure.”
JOB.23.1	Then Job spoke again:
JOB.23.2	“My complaint today is still a bitter one,
JOB.23.2	and I try hard not to groan aloud.
JOB.23.3	If only I knew where to find God,
JOB.23.3	I would go to his court.
JOB.23.4	I would lay out my case
JOB.23.4	and present my arguments.
JOB.23.5	Then I would listen to his reply
JOB.23.5	and understand what he says to me.
JOB.23.6	Would he use his great power to argue with me?
JOB.23.6	No, he would give me a fair hearing.
JOB.23.7	Honest people can reason with him,
JOB.23.7	so I would be forever acquitted by my judge.
JOB.23.8	I go east, but he is not there.
JOB.23.8	I go west, but I cannot find him.
JOB.23.9	I do not see him in the north, for he is hidden.
JOB.23.9	I look to the south, but he is concealed.
JOB.23.10	“But he knows where I am going.
JOB.23.10	And when he tests me, I will come out as pure as gold.
JOB.23.11	For I have stayed on God’s paths;
JOB.23.11	I have followed his ways and not turned aside.
JOB.23.12	I have not departed from his commands,
JOB.23.12	but have treasured his words more than daily food.
JOB.23.13	But once he has made his decision, who can change his mind?
JOB.23.13	Whatever he wants to do, he does.
JOB.23.14	So he will do to me whatever he has planned.
JOB.23.14	He controls my destiny.
JOB.23.15	No wonder I am so terrified in his presence.
JOB.23.15	When I think of it, terror grips me.
JOB.23.16	God has made me sick at heart;
JOB.23.16	the Almighty has terrified me.
JOB.23.17	Darkness is all around me;
JOB.23.17	thick, impenetrable darkness is everywhere.
JOB.24.1	“Why doesn’t the Almighty bring the wicked to judgment?
JOB.24.1	Why must the godly wait for him in vain?
JOB.24.2	Evil people steal land by moving the boundary markers.
JOB.24.2	They steal livestock and put them in their own pastures.
JOB.24.3	They take the orphan’s donkey
JOB.24.3	and demand the widow’s ox as security for a loan.
JOB.24.4	The poor are pushed off the path;
JOB.24.4	the needy must hide together for safety.
JOB.24.5	Like wild donkeys in the wilderness,
JOB.24.5	the poor must spend all their time looking for food,
JOB.24.5	searching even in the desert for food for their children.
JOB.24.6	They harvest a field they do not own,
JOB.24.6	and they glean in the vineyards of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	All night they lie naked in the cold,
JOB.24.7	without clothing or covering.
JOB.24.8	They are soaked by mountain showers,
JOB.24.8	and they huddle against the rocks for want of a home.
JOB.24.9	“The wicked snatch a widow’s child from her breast,
JOB.24.9	taking the baby as security for a loan.
JOB.24.10	The poor must go about naked, without any clothing.
JOB.24.10	They harvest food for others while they themselves are starving.
JOB.24.11	They press out olive oil without being allowed to taste it,
JOB.24.11	and they tread in the winepress as they suffer from thirst.
JOB.24.12	The groans of the dying rise from the city,
JOB.24.12	and the wounded cry for help,
JOB.24.12	yet God ignores their moaning.
JOB.24.13	“Wicked people rebel against the light.
JOB.24.13	They refuse to acknowledge its ways
JOB.24.13	or stay in its paths.
JOB.24.14	The murderer rises in the early dawn
JOB.24.14	to kill the poor and needy;
JOB.24.14	at night he is a thief.
JOB.24.15	The adulterer waits for the twilight,
JOB.24.15	saying, ‘No one will see me then.’
JOB.24.15	He hides his face so no one will know him.
JOB.24.16	Thieves break into houses at night
JOB.24.16	and sleep in the daytime.
JOB.24.16	They are not acquainted with the light.
JOB.24.17	The black night is their morning.
JOB.24.17	They ally themselves with the terrors of the darkness.
JOB.24.18	“But they disappear like foam down a river.
JOB.24.18	Everything they own is cursed,
JOB.24.18	and they are afraid to enter their own vineyards.
JOB.24.19	The grave
JOB.24.19	just as drought and heat consume snow.
JOB.24.20	Their own mothers will forget them.
JOB.24.20	Maggots will find them sweet to eat.
JOB.24.20	No one will remember them.
JOB.24.20	Wicked people are broken like a tree in the storm.
JOB.24.21	They cheat the woman who has no son to help her.
JOB.24.21	They refuse to help the needy widow.
JOB.24.22	“God, in his power, drags away the rich.
JOB.24.22	They may rise high, but they have no assurance of life.
JOB.24.23	They may be allowed to live in security,
JOB.24.23	but God is always watching them.
JOB.24.24	And though they are great now,
JOB.24.24	in a moment they will be gone like all others,
JOB.24.24	cut off like heads of grain.
JOB.24.25	Can anyone claim otherwise?
JOB.24.25	Who can prove me wrong?”
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
JOB.25.2	“God is powerful and dreadful.
JOB.25.2	He enforces peace in the heavens.
JOB.25.3	Who is able to count his heavenly army?
JOB.25.3	Doesn’t his light shine on all the earth?
JOB.25.4	How can a mortal be innocent before God?
JOB.25.4	Can anyone born of a woman be pure?
JOB.25.5	God is more glorious than the moon;
JOB.25.5	he shines brighter than the stars.
JOB.25.6	In comparison, people are maggots;
JOB.25.6	we mortals are mere worms.”
JOB.26.1	Then Job spoke again:
JOB.26.2	“How you have helped the powerless!
JOB.26.2	How you have saved the weak!
JOB.26.3	How you have enlightened my stupidity!
JOB.26.3	What wise advice you have offered!
JOB.26.4	Where have you gotten all these wise sayings?
JOB.26.4	Whose spirit speaks through you?
JOB.26.5	“The dead tremble—
JOB.26.5	those who live beneath the waters.
JOB.26.6	The underworld
JOB.26.6	The place of destruction
JOB.26.7	God stretches the northern sky over empty space
JOB.26.7	and hangs the earth on nothing.
JOB.26.8	He wraps the rain in his thick clouds,
JOB.26.8	and the clouds don’t burst with the weight.
JOB.26.9	He covers the face of the moon,
JOB.26.9	shrouding it with his clouds.
JOB.26.10	He created the horizon when he separated the waters;
JOB.26.10	he set the boundary between day and night.
JOB.26.11	The foundations of heaven tremble;
JOB.26.11	they shudder at his rebuke.
JOB.26.12	By his power the sea grew calm.
JOB.26.12	By his skill he crushed the great sea monster.
JOB.26.13	His Spirit made the heavens beautiful,
JOB.26.13	and his power pierced the gliding serpent.
JOB.26.14	These are just the beginning of all that he does,
JOB.26.14	merely a whisper of his power.
JOB.26.14	Who, then, can comprehend the thunder of his power?”
JOB.27.1	Job continued speaking:
JOB.27.2	“I vow by the living God, who has taken away my rights,
JOB.27.2	by the Almighty who has embittered my soul—
JOB.27.3	As long as I live,
JOB.27.3	while I have breath from God,
JOB.27.4	my lips will speak no evil,
JOB.27.4	and my tongue will speak no lies.
JOB.27.5	I will never concede that you are right;
JOB.27.5	I will defend my integrity until I die.
JOB.27.6	I will maintain my innocence without wavering.
JOB.27.6	My conscience is clear for as long as I live.
JOB.27.7	“May my enemy be punished like the wicked,
JOB.27.7	my adversary like those who do evil.
JOB.27.8	For what hope do the godless have when God cuts them off
JOB.27.8	and takes away their life?
JOB.27.9	Will God listen to their cry
JOB.27.9	when trouble comes upon them?
JOB.27.10	Can they take delight in the Almighty?
JOB.27.10	Can they call to God at any time?
JOB.27.11	I will teach you about God’s power.
JOB.27.11	I will not conceal anything concerning the Almighty.
JOB.27.12	But you have seen all this,
JOB.27.12	yet you say all these useless things to me.
JOB.27.13	“This is what the wicked will receive from God;
JOB.27.13	this is their inheritance from the Almighty.
JOB.27.14	They may have many children,
JOB.27.14	but the children will die in war or starve to death.
JOB.27.15	Those who survive will die of a plague,
JOB.27.15	and not even their widows will mourn them.
JOB.27.16	“Evil people may have piles of money
JOB.27.16	and may store away mounds of clothing.
JOB.27.17	But the righteous will wear that clothing,
JOB.27.17	and the innocent will divide that money.
JOB.27.18	The wicked build houses as fragile as a spider’s web,
JOB.27.18	as flimsy as a shelter made of branches.
JOB.27.19	The wicked go to bed rich
JOB.27.19	but wake to find that all their wealth is gone.
JOB.27.20	Terror overwhelms them like a flood,
JOB.27.20	and they are blown away in the storms of the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind carries them away, and they are gone.
JOB.27.21	It sweeps them away.
JOB.27.22	It whirls down on them without mercy.
JOB.27.22	They struggle to flee from its power.
JOB.27.23	But everyone jeers at them
JOB.27.23	and mocks them.
JOB.28.1	“People know where to mine silver
JOB.28.1	and how to refine gold.
JOB.28.2	They know where to dig iron from the earth
JOB.28.2	and how to smelt copper from rock.
JOB.28.3	They know how to shine light in the darkness
JOB.28.3	and explore the farthest regions of the earth
JOB.28.3	as they search in the dark for ore.
JOB.28.4	They sink a mine shaft into the earth
JOB.28.4	far from where anyone lives.
JOB.28.4	They descend on ropes, swinging back and forth.
JOB.28.5	Food is grown on the earth above,
JOB.28.5	but down below, the earth is melted as by fire.
JOB.28.6	Here the rocks contain precious lapis lazuli,
JOB.28.6	and the dust contains gold.
JOB.28.7	These are treasures no bird of prey can see,
JOB.28.7	no falcon’s eye observe.
JOB.28.8	No wild animal has walked upon these treasures;
JOB.28.8	no lion has ever set his paw there.
JOB.28.9	People know how to tear apart flinty rocks
JOB.28.9	and overturn the roots of mountains.
JOB.28.10	They cut tunnels in the rocks
JOB.28.10	and uncover precious stones.
JOB.28.11	They dam up the trickling streams
JOB.28.11	and bring to light the hidden treasures.
JOB.28.12	“But do people know where to find wisdom?
JOB.28.12	Where can they find understanding?
JOB.28.13	No one knows where to find it,
JOB.28.13	for it is not found among the living.
JOB.28.14	‘It is not here,’ says the ocean.
JOB.28.14	‘Nor is it here,’ says the sea.
JOB.28.15	It cannot be bought with gold.
JOB.28.15	It cannot be purchased with silver.
JOB.28.16	It’s worth more than all the gold of Ophir,
JOB.28.16	greater than precious onyx or lapis lazuli.
JOB.28.17	Wisdom is more valuable than gold and crystal.
JOB.28.17	It cannot be purchased with jewels mounted in fine gold.
JOB.28.18	Coral and jasper are worthless in trying to get it.
JOB.28.18	The price of wisdom is far above rubies.
JOB.28.19	Precious peridot from Ethiopia
JOB.28.19	It’s worth more than the purest gold.
JOB.28.20	“But do people know where to find wisdom?
JOB.28.20	Where can they find understanding?
JOB.28.21	It is hidden from the eyes of all humanity.
JOB.28.21	Even the sharp-eyed birds in the sky cannot discover it.
JOB.28.22	Destruction
JOB.28.22	‘We’ve heard only rumors of where wisdom can be found.’
JOB.28.23	“God alone understands the way to wisdom;
JOB.28.23	he knows where it can be found,
JOB.28.24	for he looks throughout the whole earth
JOB.28.24	and sees everything under the heavens.
JOB.28.25	He decided how hard the winds should blow
JOB.28.25	and how much rain should fall.
JOB.28.26	He made the laws for the rain
JOB.28.26	and laid out a path for the lightning.
JOB.28.27	Then he saw wisdom and evaluated it.
JOB.28.27	He set it in place and examined it thoroughly.
JOB.28.28	And this is what he says to all humanity:
JOB.28.28	‘The fear of the Lord is true wisdom;
JOB.28.28	to forsake evil is real understanding.’”
JOB.29.1	Job continued speaking:
JOB.29.2	“I long for the years gone by
JOB.29.2	when God took care of me,
JOB.29.3	when he lit up the way before me
JOB.29.3	and I walked safely through the darkness.
JOB.29.4	When I was in my prime,
JOB.29.4	God’s friendship was felt in my home.
JOB.29.5	The Almighty was still with me,
JOB.29.5	and my children were around me.
JOB.29.6	My steps were awash in cream,
JOB.29.6	and the rocks gushed olive oil for me.
JOB.29.7	“Those were the days when I went to the city gate
JOB.29.7	and took my place among the honored leaders.
JOB.29.8	The young stepped aside when they saw me,
JOB.29.8	and even the aged rose in respect at my coming.
JOB.29.9	The princes stood in silence
JOB.29.9	and put their hands over their mouths.
JOB.29.10	The highest officials of the city stood quietly,
JOB.29.10	holding their tongues in respect.
JOB.29.11	“All who heard me praised me.
JOB.29.11	All who saw me spoke well of me.
JOB.29.12	For I assisted the poor in their need
JOB.29.12	and the orphans who required help.
JOB.29.13	I helped those without hope, and they blessed me.
JOB.29.13	And I caused the widows’ hearts to sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	Everything I did was honest.
JOB.29.14	Righteousness covered me like a robe,
JOB.29.14	and I wore justice like a turban.
JOB.29.15	I served as eyes for the blind
JOB.29.15	and feet for the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the poor
JOB.29.16	and assisted strangers who needed help.
JOB.29.17	I broke the jaws of godless oppressors
JOB.29.17	and plucked their victims from their teeth.
JOB.29.18	“I thought, ‘Surely I will die surrounded by my family
JOB.29.18	after a long, good life.
JOB.29.19	For I am like a tree whose roots reach the water,
JOB.29.19	whose branches are refreshed with the dew.
JOB.29.20	New honors are constantly bestowed on me,
JOB.29.20	and my strength is continually renewed.’
JOB.29.21	“Everyone listened to my advice.
JOB.29.21	They were silent as they waited for me to speak.
JOB.29.22	And after I spoke, they had nothing to add,
JOB.29.22	for my counsel satisfied them.
JOB.29.23	They longed for me to speak as people long for rain.
JOB.29.23	They drank my words like a refreshing spring rain.
JOB.29.24	When they were discouraged, I smiled at them.
JOB.29.24	My look of approval was precious to them.
JOB.29.25	Like a chief, I told them what to do.
JOB.29.25	I lived like a king among his troops
JOB.29.25	and comforted those who mourned.
JOB.30.1	“But now I am mocked by people younger than I,
JOB.30.1	by young men whose fathers are not worthy to run with my sheepdogs.
JOB.30.2	A lot of good they are to me—
JOB.30.2	those worn-out wretches!
JOB.30.3	They are gaunt from poverty and hunger.
JOB.30.3	They claw the dry ground in desolate wastelands.
JOB.30.4	They pluck wild greens from among the bushes
JOB.30.4	and eat from the roots of broom trees.
JOB.30.5	They are driven from human society,
JOB.30.5	and people shout at them as if they were thieves.
JOB.30.6	So now they live in frightening ravines,
JOB.30.6	in caves and among the rocks.
JOB.30.7	They sound like animals howling among the bushes,
JOB.30.7	huddled together beneath the nettles.
JOB.30.8	They are nameless fools,
JOB.30.8	outcasts from society.
JOB.30.9	“And now they mock me with vulgar songs!
JOB.30.9	They taunt me!
JOB.30.10	They despise me and won’t come near me,
JOB.30.10	except to spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	For God has cut my bowstring.
JOB.30.11	He has humbled me,
JOB.30.11	so they have thrown off all restraint.
JOB.30.12	These outcasts oppose me to my face.
JOB.30.12	They send me sprawling
JOB.30.12	and lay traps in my path.
JOB.30.13	They block my road
JOB.30.13	and do everything they can to destroy me.
JOB.30.13	They know I have no one to help me.
JOB.30.14	They come at me from all directions.
JOB.30.14	They jump on me when I am down.
JOB.30.15	I live in terror now.
JOB.30.15	My honor has blown away in the wind,
JOB.30.15	and my prosperity has vanished like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	“And now my life seeps away.
JOB.30.16	Depression haunts my days.
JOB.30.17	At night my bones are filled with pain,
JOB.30.17	which gnaws at me relentlessly.
JOB.30.18	With a strong hand, God grabs my shirt.
JOB.30.18	He grips me by the collar of my coat.
JOB.30.19	He has thrown me into the mud.
JOB.30.19	I’m nothing more than dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	“I cry to you, O God, but you don’t answer.
JOB.30.20	I stand before you, but you don’t even look.
JOB.30.21	You have become cruel toward me.
JOB.30.21	You use your power to persecute me.
JOB.30.22	You throw me into the whirlwind
JOB.30.22	and destroy me in the storm.
JOB.30.23	And I know you are sending me to my death—
JOB.30.23	the destination of all who live.
JOB.30.24	“Surely no one would turn against the needy
JOB.30.24	when they cry for help in their trouble.
JOB.30.25	Did I not weep for those in trouble?
JOB.30.25	Was I not deeply grieved for the needy?
JOB.30.26	So I looked for good, but evil came instead.
JOB.30.26	I waited for the light, but darkness fell.
JOB.30.27	My heart is troubled and restless.
JOB.30.27	Days of suffering torment me.
JOB.30.28	I walk in gloom, without sunlight.
JOB.30.28	I stand in the public square and cry for help.
JOB.30.29	Instead, I am considered a brother to jackals
JOB.30.29	and a companion to owls.
JOB.30.30	My skin has turned dark,
JOB.30.30	and my bones burn with fever.
JOB.30.31	My harp plays sad music,
JOB.30.31	and my flute accompanies those who weep.
JOB.31.1	“I made a covenant with my eyes
JOB.31.1	not to look with lust at a young woman.
JOB.31.2	For what has God above chosen for us?
JOB.31.2	What is our inheritance from the Almighty on high?
JOB.31.3	Isn’t it calamity for the wicked
JOB.31.3	and misfortune for those who do evil?
JOB.31.4	Doesn’t he see everything I do
JOB.31.4	and every step I take?
JOB.31.5	“Have I lied to anyone
JOB.31.5	or deceived anyone?
JOB.31.6	Let God weigh me on the scales of justice,
JOB.31.6	for he knows my integrity.
JOB.31.7	If I have strayed from his pathway,
JOB.31.7	or if my heart has lusted for what my eyes have seen,
JOB.31.7	or if I am guilty of any other sin,
JOB.31.8	then let someone else eat the crops I have planted.
JOB.31.8	Let all that I have planted be uprooted.
JOB.31.9	“If my heart has been seduced by a woman,
JOB.31.9	or if I have lusted for my neighbor’s wife,
JOB.31.10	then let my wife serve
JOB.31.10	let other men sleep with her.
JOB.31.11	For lust is a shameful sin,
JOB.31.11	a crime that should be punished.
JOB.31.12	It is a fire that burns all the way to hell.
JOB.31.12	It would wipe out everything I own.
JOB.31.13	“If I have been unfair to my male or female servants
JOB.31.13	when they brought their complaints to me,
JOB.31.14	how could I face God?
JOB.31.14	What could I say when he questioned me?
JOB.31.15	For God created both me and my servants.
JOB.31.15	He created us both in the womb.
JOB.31.16	“Have I refused to help the poor,
JOB.31.16	or crushed the hopes of widows?
JOB.31.17	Have I been stingy with my food
JOB.31.17	and refused to share it with orphans?
JOB.31.18	No, from childhood I have cared for orphans like a father,
JOB.31.18	and all my life I have cared for widows.
JOB.31.19	Whenever I saw the homeless without clothes
JOB.31.19	and the needy with nothing to wear,
JOB.31.20	did they not praise me
JOB.31.20	for providing wool clothing to keep them warm?
JOB.31.21	“If I raised my hand against an orphan,
JOB.31.21	knowing the judges would take my side,
JOB.31.22	then let my shoulder be wrenched out of place!
JOB.31.22	Let my arm be torn from its socket!
JOB.31.23	That would be better than facing God’s judgment.
JOB.31.23	For if the majesty of God opposes me, what hope is there?
JOB.31.24	“Have I put my trust in money
JOB.31.24	or felt secure because of my gold?
JOB.31.25	Have I gloated about my wealth
JOB.31.25	and all that I own?
JOB.31.26	“Have I looked at the sun shining in the skies,
JOB.31.26	or the moon walking down its silver pathway,
JOB.31.27	and been secretly enticed in my heart
JOB.31.27	to throw kisses at them in worship?
JOB.31.28	If so, I should be punished by the judges,
JOB.31.28	for it would mean I had denied the God of heaven.
JOB.31.29	“Have I ever rejoiced when disaster struck my enemies,
JOB.31.29	or become excited when harm came their way?
JOB.31.30	No, I have never sinned by cursing anyone
JOB.31.30	or by asking for revenge.
JOB.31.31	“My servants have never said,
JOB.31.31	‘He let others go hungry.’
JOB.31.32	I have never turned away a stranger
JOB.31.32	but have opened my doors to everyone.
JOB.31.33	“Have I tried to hide my sins like other people do,
JOB.31.33	concealing my guilt in my heart?
JOB.31.34	Have I feared the crowd
JOB.31.34	or the contempt of the masses,
JOB.31.34	so that I kept quiet and stayed indoors?
JOB.31.35	“If only someone would listen to me!
JOB.31.35	Look, I will sign my name to my defense.
JOB.31.35	Let the Almighty answer me.
JOB.31.35	Let my accuser write out the charges against me.
JOB.31.36	I would face the accusation proudly.
JOB.31.36	I would wear it like a crown.
JOB.31.37	For I would tell him exactly what I have done.
JOB.31.37	I would come before him like a prince.
JOB.31.38	“If my land accuses me
JOB.31.38	and all its furrows cry out together,
JOB.31.39	or if I have stolen its crops
JOB.31.39	or murdered its owners,
JOB.31.40	then let thistles grow on that land instead of wheat,
JOB.31.40	and weeds instead of barley.”
JOB.31.40	Job’s words are ended.
JOB.32.1	Job’s three friends refused to reply further to him because he kept insisting on his innocence.
JOB.32.2	Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, became angry. He was angry because Job refused to admit that he had sinned and that God was right in punishing him. 
JOB.32.3	He was also angry with Job’s three friends, for they made God
JOB.32.4	Elihu had waited for the others to speak to Job because they were older than he. 
JOB.32.5	But when he saw that they had no further reply, he spoke out angrily. 
JOB.32.6	Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said, 
JOB.32.6	“I am young and you are old,
JOB.32.6	so I held back from telling you what I think.
JOB.32.7	I thought, ‘Those who are older should speak,
JOB.32.7	for wisdom comes with age.’
JOB.32.8	But there is a spirit
JOB.32.8	the breath of the Almighty within them,
JOB.32.8	that makes them intelligent.
JOB.32.9	Sometimes the elders are not wise.
JOB.32.9	Sometimes the aged do not understand justice.
JOB.32.10	So listen to me,
JOB.32.10	and let me tell you what I think.
JOB.32.11	“I have waited all this time,
JOB.32.11	listening very carefully to your arguments,
JOB.32.11	listening to you grope for words.
JOB.32.12	I have listened,
JOB.32.12	but not one of you has refuted Job
JOB.32.12	or answered his arguments.
JOB.32.13	And don’t tell me, ‘He is too wise for us.
JOB.32.13	Only God can convince him.’
JOB.32.14	If Job had been arguing with me,
JOB.32.14	I would not answer with your kind of logic!
JOB.32.15	You sit there baffled,
JOB.32.15	with nothing more to say.
JOB.32.16	Should I continue to wait, now that you are silent?
JOB.32.16	Must I also remain silent?
JOB.32.17	No, I will say my piece.
JOB.32.17	I will speak my mind.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of pent-up words,
JOB.32.18	and the spirit within me urges me on.
JOB.32.19	I am like a cask of wine without a vent,
JOB.32.19	like a new wineskin ready to burst!
JOB.32.20	I must speak to find relief,
JOB.32.20	so let me give my answers.
JOB.32.21	I won’t play favorites
JOB.32.21	or try to flatter anyone.
JOB.32.22	For if I tried flattery,
JOB.32.22	my Creator would soon destroy me.
JOB.33.1	“Listen to my words, Job;
JOB.33.1	pay attention to what I have to say.
JOB.33.2	Now that I have begun to speak,
JOB.33.2	let me continue.
JOB.33.3	I speak with all sincerity;
JOB.33.3	I speak the truth.
JOB.33.4	For the Spirit of God has made me,
JOB.33.4	and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
JOB.33.5	Answer me, if you can;
JOB.33.5	make your case and take your stand.
JOB.33.6	Look, you and I both belong to God.
JOB.33.6	I, too, was formed from clay.
JOB.33.7	So you don’t need to be afraid of me.
JOB.33.7	I won’t come down hard on you.
JOB.33.8	“You have spoken in my hearing,
JOB.33.8	and I have heard your very words.
JOB.33.9	You said, ‘I am pure; I am without sin;
JOB.33.9	I am innocent; I have no guilt.
JOB.33.10	God is picking a quarrel with me,
JOB.33.10	and he considers me his enemy.
JOB.33.11	He puts my feet in the stocks
JOB.33.11	and watches my every move.’
JOB.33.12	“But you are wrong, and I will show you why.
JOB.33.12	For God is greater than any human being.
JOB.33.13	So why are you bringing a charge against him?
JOB.33.13	Why say he does not respond to people’s complaints?
JOB.33.14	For God speaks again and again,
JOB.33.14	though people do not recognize it.
JOB.33.15	He speaks in dreams, in visions of the night,
JOB.33.15	when deep sleep falls on people
JOB.33.15	as they lie in their beds.
JOB.33.16	He whispers in their ears
JOB.33.16	and terrifies them with warnings.
JOB.33.17	He makes them turn from doing wrong;
JOB.33.17	he keeps them from pride.
JOB.33.18	He protects them from the grave,
JOB.33.18	from crossing over the river of death.
JOB.33.19	“Or God disciplines people with pain on their sickbeds,
JOB.33.19	with ceaseless aching in their bones.
JOB.33.20	They lose their appetite
JOB.33.20	for even the most delicious food.
JOB.33.21	Their flesh wastes away,
JOB.33.21	and their bones stick out.
JOB.33.22	They are at death’s door;
JOB.33.22	the angels of death wait for them.
JOB.33.23	“But if an angel from heaven appears—
JOB.33.23	a special messenger to intercede for a person
JOB.33.23	and declare that he is upright—
JOB.33.24	he will be gracious and say,
JOB.33.24	‘Rescue him from the grave,
JOB.33.24	for I have found a ransom for his life.’
JOB.33.25	Then his body will become as healthy as a child’s,
JOB.33.25	firm and youthful again.
JOB.33.26	When he prays to God,
JOB.33.26	he will be accepted.
JOB.33.26	And God will receive him with joy
JOB.33.26	and restore him to good standing.
JOB.33.27	He will declare to his friends,
JOB.33.27	‘I sinned and twisted the truth,
JOB.33.27	but it was not worth it.
JOB.33.28	God rescued me from the grave,
JOB.33.28	and now my life is filled with light.’
JOB.33.29	“Yes, God does these things
JOB.33.29	again and again for people.
JOB.33.30	He rescues them from the grave
JOB.33.30	so they may enjoy the light of life.
JOB.33.31	Mark this well, Job. Listen to me,
JOB.33.31	for I have more to say.
JOB.33.32	But if you have anything to say, go ahead.
JOB.33.32	Speak, for I am anxious to see you justified.
JOB.33.33	But if not, then listen to me.
JOB.33.33	Keep silent and I will teach you wisdom!”
JOB.34.1	Then Elihu said:
JOB.34.2	“Listen to me, you wise men.
JOB.34.2	Pay attention, you who have knowledge.
JOB.34.3	Job said, ‘The ear tests the words it hears
JOB.34.3	just as the mouth distinguishes between foods.’
JOB.34.4	So let us discern for ourselves what is right;
JOB.34.4	let us learn together what is good.
JOB.34.5	For Job also said, ‘I am innocent,
JOB.34.5	but God has taken away my rights.
JOB.34.6	I am innocent, but they call me a liar.
JOB.34.6	My suffering is incurable, though I have not sinned.’
JOB.34.7	“Tell me, has there ever been a man like Job,
JOB.34.7	with his thirst for irreverent talk?
JOB.34.8	He chooses evil people as companions.
JOB.34.8	He spends his time with wicked men.
JOB.34.9	He has even said, ‘Why waste time
JOB.34.9	trying to please God?’
JOB.34.10	“Listen to me, you who have understanding.
JOB.34.10	Everyone knows that God doesn’t sin!
JOB.34.10	The Almighty can do no wrong.
JOB.34.11	He repays people according to their deeds.
JOB.34.11	He treats people as they deserve.
JOB.34.12	Truly, God will not do wrong.
JOB.34.12	The Almighty will not twist justice.
JOB.34.13	Did someone else put the world in his care?
JOB.34.13	Who set the whole world in place?
JOB.34.14	If God were to take back his spirit
JOB.34.14	and withdraw his breath,
JOB.34.15	all life would cease,
JOB.34.15	and humanity would turn again to dust.
JOB.34.16	“Now listen to me if you are wise.
JOB.34.16	Pay attention to what I say.
JOB.34.17	Could God govern if he hated justice?
JOB.34.17	Are you going to condemn the almighty judge?
JOB.34.18	For he says to kings, ‘You are wicked,’
JOB.34.18	and to nobles, ‘You are unjust.’
JOB.34.19	He doesn’t care how great a person may be,
JOB.34.19	and he pays no more attention to the rich than to the poor.
JOB.34.19	He made them all.
JOB.34.20	In a moment they die.
JOB.34.20	In the middle of the night they pass away;
JOB.34.20	the mighty are removed without human hand.
JOB.34.21	“For God watches how people live;
JOB.34.21	he sees everything they do.
JOB.34.22	No darkness is thick enough
JOB.34.22	to hide the wicked from his eyes.
JOB.34.23	We don’t set the time
JOB.34.23	when we will come before God in judgment.
JOB.34.24	He brings the mighty to ruin without asking anyone,
JOB.34.24	and he sets up others in their place.
JOB.34.25	He knows what they do,
JOB.34.25	and in the night he overturns and destroys them.
JOB.34.26	He strikes them down because they are wicked,
JOB.34.26	doing it openly for all to see.
JOB.34.27	For they turned away from following him.
JOB.34.27	They have no respect for any of his ways.
JOB.34.28	They cause the poor to cry out, catching God’s attention.
JOB.34.28	He hears the cries of the needy.
JOB.34.29	But if he chooses to remain quiet,
JOB.34.29	who can criticize him?
JOB.34.29	When he hides his face, no one can find him,
JOB.34.29	whether an individual or a nation.
JOB.34.30	He prevents the godless from ruling
JOB.34.30	so they cannot be a snare to the people.
JOB.34.31	“Why don’t people say to God, ‘I have sinned,
JOB.34.31	but I will sin no more’?
JOB.34.32	Or ‘I don’t know what evil I have done—tell me.
JOB.34.32	If I have done wrong, I will stop at once’?
JOB.34.33	“Must God tailor his justice to your demands?
JOB.34.33	But you have rejected him!
JOB.34.33	The choice is yours, not mine.
JOB.34.33	Go ahead, share your wisdom with us.
JOB.34.34	After all, bright people will tell me,
JOB.34.34	and wise people will hear me say,
JOB.34.35	‘Job speaks out of ignorance;
JOB.34.35	his words lack insight.’
JOB.34.36	Job, you deserve the maximum penalty
JOB.34.36	for the wicked way you have talked.
JOB.34.37	For you have added rebellion to your sin;
JOB.34.37	you show no respect,
JOB.34.37	and you speak many angry words against God.”
JOB.35.1	Then Elihu said:
JOB.35.2	“Do you think it is right for you to claim,
JOB.35.2	‘I am righteous before God’?
JOB.35.3	For you also ask, ‘What’s in it for me?
JOB.35.3	What’s the use of living a righteous life?’
JOB.35.4	“I will answer you
JOB.35.4	and all your friends, too.
JOB.35.5	Look up into the sky,
JOB.35.5	and see the clouds high above you.
JOB.35.6	If you sin, how does that affect God?
JOB.35.6	Even if you sin again and again,
JOB.35.6	what effect will it have on him?
JOB.35.7	If you are good, is this some great gift to him?
JOB.35.7	What could you possibly give him?
JOB.35.8	No, your sins affect only people like yourself,
JOB.35.8	and your good deeds also affect only humans.
JOB.35.9	“People cry out when they are oppressed.
JOB.35.9	They groan beneath the power of the mighty.
JOB.35.10	Yet they don’t ask, ‘Where is God my Creator,
JOB.35.10	the one who gives songs in the night?
JOB.35.11	Where is the one who makes us smarter than the animals
JOB.35.11	and wiser than the birds of the sky?’
JOB.35.12	And when they cry out, God does not answer
JOB.35.12	because of their pride.
JOB.35.13	But it is wrong to say God doesn’t listen,
JOB.35.13	to say the Almighty isn’t concerned.
JOB.35.14	You say you can’t see him,
JOB.35.14	but he will bring justice if you will only wait.
JOB.35.15	You say he does not respond to sinners with anger
JOB.35.15	and is not greatly concerned about wickedness.
JOB.35.16	But you are talking nonsense, Job.
JOB.35.16	You have spoken like a fool.”
JOB.36.1	Elihu continued speaking:
JOB.36.2	“Let me go on, and I will show you the truth.
JOB.36.2	For I have not finished defending God!
JOB.36.3	I will present profound arguments
JOB.36.3	for the righteousness of my Creator.
JOB.36.4	I am telling you nothing but the truth,
JOB.36.4	for I am a man of great knowledge.
JOB.36.5	“God is mighty, but he does not despise anyone!
JOB.36.5	He is mighty in both power and understanding.
JOB.36.6	He does not let the wicked live
JOB.36.6	but gives justice to the afflicted.
JOB.36.7	He never takes his eyes off the innocent,
JOB.36.7	but he sets them on thrones with kings
JOB.36.7	and exalts them forever.
JOB.36.8	If they are bound in chains
JOB.36.8	and caught up in a web of trouble,
JOB.36.9	he shows them the reason.
JOB.36.9	He shows them their sins of pride.
JOB.36.10	He gets their attention
JOB.36.10	and commands that they turn from evil.
JOB.36.11	“If they listen and obey God,
JOB.36.11	they will be blessed with prosperity throughout their lives.
JOB.36.11	All their years will be pleasant.
JOB.36.12	But if they refuse to listen to him,
JOB.36.12	they will cross over the river of death,
JOB.36.12	dying from lack of understanding.
JOB.36.13	For the godless are full of resentment.
JOB.36.13	Even when he punishes them,
JOB.36.13	they refuse to cry out to him for help.
JOB.36.14	They die when they are young,
JOB.36.14	after wasting their lives in immoral living.
JOB.36.15	But by means of their suffering, he rescues those who suffer.
JOB.36.15	For he gets their attention through adversity.
JOB.36.16	“God is leading you away from danger, Job,
JOB.36.16	to a place free from distress.
JOB.36.16	He is setting your table with the best food.
JOB.36.17	But you are obsessed with whether the godless will be judged.
JOB.36.17	Don’t worry, judgment and justice will be upheld.
JOB.36.18	But watch out, or you may be seduced by wealth.
JOB.36.18	Don’t let yourself be bribed into sin.
JOB.36.19	Could all your wealth
JOB.36.19	or all your mighty efforts
JOB.36.19	keep you from distress?
JOB.36.20	Do not long for the cover of night,
JOB.36.20	for that is when people will be destroyed.
JOB.36.21	Be on guard! Turn back from evil,
JOB.36.21	for God sent this suffering
JOB.36.21	to keep you from a life of evil.
JOB.36.22	“Look, God is all-powerful.
JOB.36.22	Who is a teacher like him?
JOB.36.23	No one can tell him what to do,
JOB.36.23	or say to him, ‘You have done wrong.’
JOB.36.24	Instead, glorify his mighty works,
JOB.36.24	singing songs of praise.
JOB.36.25	Everyone has seen these things,
JOB.36.25	though only from a distance.
JOB.36.26	“Look, God is greater than we can understand.
JOB.36.26	His years cannot be counted.
JOB.36.27	He draws up the water vapor
JOB.36.27	and then distills it into rain.
JOB.36.28	The rain pours down from the clouds,
JOB.36.28	and everyone benefits.
JOB.36.29	Who can understand the spreading of the clouds
JOB.36.29	and the thunder that rolls forth from heaven?
JOB.36.30	See how he spreads the lightning around him
JOB.36.30	and how it lights up the depths of the sea.
JOB.36.31	By these mighty acts he nourishes
JOB.36.31	giving them food in abundance.
JOB.36.32	He fills his hands with lightning bolts
JOB.36.32	and hurls each at its target.
JOB.36.33	The thunder announces his presence;
JOB.36.33	the storm announces his indignant anger.
JOB.37.1	“My heart pounds as I think of this.
JOB.37.1	It trembles within me.
JOB.37.2	Listen carefully to the thunder of God’s voice
JOB.37.2	as it rolls from his mouth.
JOB.37.3	It rolls across the heavens,
JOB.37.3	and his lightning flashes in every direction.
JOB.37.4	Then comes the roaring of the thunder—
JOB.37.4	the tremendous voice of his majesty.
JOB.37.4	He does not restrain it when he speaks.
JOB.37.5	God’s voice is glorious in the thunder.
JOB.37.5	We can’t even imagine the greatness of his power.
JOB.37.6	“He directs the snow to fall on the earth
JOB.37.6	and tells the rain to pour down.
JOB.37.7	Then everyone stops working
JOB.37.7	so they can watch his power.
JOB.37.8	The wild animals take cover
JOB.37.8	and stay inside their dens.
JOB.37.9	The stormy wind comes from its chamber,
JOB.37.9	and the driving winds bring the cold.
JOB.37.10	God’s breath sends the ice,
JOB.37.10	freezing wide expanses of water.
JOB.37.11	He loads the clouds with moisture,
JOB.37.11	and they flash with his lightning.
JOB.37.12	The clouds churn about at his direction.
JOB.37.12	They do whatever he commands throughout the earth.
JOB.37.13	He makes these things happen either to punish people
JOB.37.13	or to show his unfailing love.
JOB.37.14	“Pay attention to this, Job.
JOB.37.14	Stop and consider the wonderful miracles of God!
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God controls the storm
JOB.37.15	and causes the lightning to flash from his clouds?
JOB.37.16	Do you understand how he moves the clouds
JOB.37.16	with wonderful perfection and skill?
JOB.37.17	When you are sweltering in your clothes
JOB.37.17	and the south wind dies down and everything is still,
JOB.37.18	he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror.
JOB.37.18	Can you do that?
JOB.37.19	“So teach the rest of us what to say to God.
JOB.37.19	We are too ignorant to make our own arguments.
JOB.37.20	Should God be notified that I want to speak?
JOB.37.20	Can people even speak when they are confused?
JOB.37.21	We cannot look at the sun,
JOB.37.21	for it shines brightly in the sky
JOB.37.21	when the wind clears away the clouds.
JOB.37.22	So also, golden splendor comes from the mountain of God.
JOB.37.22	He is clothed in dazzling splendor.
JOB.37.23	We cannot imagine the power of the Almighty;
JOB.37.23	but even though he is just and righteous,
JOB.37.23	he does not destroy us.
JOB.37.24	No wonder people everywhere fear him.
JOB.37.24	All who are wise show him reverence.
JOB.38.1	Then the 
JOB.38.2	“Who is this that questions my wisdom
JOB.38.2	with such ignorant words?
JOB.38.3	Brace yourself like a man,
JOB.38.3	because I have some questions for you,
JOB.38.3	and you must answer them.
JOB.38.4	“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
JOB.38.4	Tell me, if you know so much.
JOB.38.5	Who determined its dimensions
JOB.38.5	and stretched out the surveying line?
JOB.38.6	What supports its foundations,
JOB.38.6	and who laid its cornerstone
JOB.38.7	as the morning stars sang together
JOB.38.7	and all the angels
JOB.38.8	“Who kept the sea inside its boundaries
JOB.38.8	as it burst from the womb,
JOB.38.9	and as I clothed it with clouds
JOB.38.9	and wrapped it in thick darkness?
JOB.38.10	For I locked it behind barred gates,
JOB.38.10	limiting its shores.
JOB.38.11	I said, ‘This far and no farther will you come.
JOB.38.11	Here your proud waves must stop!’
JOB.38.12	“Have you ever commanded the morning to appear
JOB.38.12	and caused the dawn to rise in the east?
JOB.38.13	Have you made daylight spread to the ends of the earth,
JOB.38.13	to bring an end to the night’s wickedness?
JOB.38.14	As the light approaches,
JOB.38.14	the earth takes shape like clay pressed beneath a seal;
JOB.38.14	it is robed in brilliant colors.
JOB.38.15	The light disturbs the wicked
JOB.38.15	and stops the arm that is raised in violence.
JOB.38.16	“Have you explored the springs from which the seas come?
JOB.38.16	Have you explored their depths?
JOB.38.17	Do you know where the gates of death are located?
JOB.38.17	Have you seen the gates of utter gloom?
JOB.38.18	Do you realize the extent of the earth?
JOB.38.18	Tell me about it if you know!
JOB.38.19	“Where does light come from,
JOB.38.19	and where does darkness go?
JOB.38.20	Can you take each to its home?
JOB.38.20	Do you know how to get there?
JOB.38.21	But of course you know all this!
JOB.38.21	For you were born before it was all created,
JOB.38.21	and you are so very experienced!
JOB.38.22	“Have you visited the storehouses of the snow
JOB.38.22	or seen the storehouses of hail?
JOB.38.23	(I have reserved them as weapons for the time of trouble,
JOB.38.23	for the day of battle and war.)
JOB.38.24	Where is the path to the source of light?
JOB.38.24	Where is the home of the east wind?
JOB.38.25	“Who created a channel for the torrents of rain?
JOB.38.25	Who laid out the path for the lightning?
JOB.38.26	Who makes the rain fall on barren land,
JOB.38.26	in a desert where no one lives?
JOB.38.27	Who sends rain to satisfy the parched ground
JOB.38.27	and make the tender grass spring up?
JOB.38.28	“Does the rain have a father?
JOB.38.28	Who gives birth to the dew?
JOB.38.29	Who is the mother of the ice?
JOB.38.29	Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens?
JOB.38.30	For the water turns to ice as hard as rock,
JOB.38.30	and the surface of the water freezes.
JOB.38.31	“Can you direct the movement of the stars—
JOB.38.31	binding the cluster of the Pleiades
JOB.38.31	or loosening the cords of Orion?
JOB.38.32	Can you direct the constellations through the seasons
JOB.38.32	or guide the Bear with her cubs across the heavens?
JOB.38.33	Do you know the laws of the universe?
JOB.38.33	Can you use them to regulate the earth?
JOB.38.34	“Can you shout to the clouds
JOB.38.34	and make it rain?
JOB.38.35	Can you make lightning appear
JOB.38.35	and cause it to strike as you direct?
JOB.38.36	Who gives intuition to the heart
JOB.38.36	and instinct to the mind?
JOB.38.37	Who is wise enough to count all the clouds?
JOB.38.37	Who can tilt the water jars of heaven
JOB.38.38	when the parched ground is dry
JOB.38.38	and the soil has hardened into clods?
JOB.38.39	“Can you stalk prey for a lioness
JOB.38.39	and satisfy the young lions’ appetites
JOB.38.40	as they lie in their dens
JOB.38.40	or crouch in the thicket?
JOB.38.41	Who provides food for the ravens
JOB.38.41	when their young cry out to God
JOB.38.41	and wander about in hunger?
JOB.39.1	“Do you know when the wild goats give birth?
JOB.39.1	Have you watched as deer are born in the wild?
JOB.39.2	Do you know how many months they carry their young?
JOB.39.2	Are you aware of the time of their delivery?
JOB.39.3	They crouch down to give birth to their young
JOB.39.3	and deliver their offspring.
JOB.39.4	Their young grow up in the open fields,
JOB.39.4	then leave home and never return.
JOB.39.5	“Who gives the wild donkey its freedom?
JOB.39.5	Who untied its ropes?
JOB.39.6	I have placed it in the wilderness;
JOB.39.6	its home is the wasteland.
JOB.39.7	It hates the noise of the city
JOB.39.7	and has no driver to shout at it.
JOB.39.8	The mountains are its pastureland,
JOB.39.8	where it searches for every blade of grass.
JOB.39.9	“Will the wild ox consent to being tamed?
JOB.39.9	Will it spend the night in your stall?
JOB.39.10	Can you hitch a wild ox to a plow?
JOB.39.10	Will it plow a field for you?
JOB.39.11	Given its strength, can you trust it?
JOB.39.11	Can you leave and trust the ox to do your work?
JOB.39.12	Can you rely on it to bring home your grain
JOB.39.12	and deliver it to your threshing floor?
JOB.39.13	“The ostrich flaps her wings grandly,
JOB.39.13	but they are no match for the feathers of the stork.
JOB.39.14	She lays her eggs on top of the earth,
JOB.39.14	letting them be warmed in the dust.
JOB.39.15	She doesn’t worry that a foot might crush them
JOB.39.15	or a wild animal might destroy them.
JOB.39.16	She is harsh toward her young,
JOB.39.16	as if they were not her own.
JOB.39.16	She doesn’t care if they die.
JOB.39.17	For God has deprived her of wisdom.
JOB.39.17	He has given her no understanding.
JOB.39.18	But whenever she jumps up to run,
JOB.39.18	she passes the swiftest horse with its rider.
JOB.39.19	“Have you given the horse its strength
JOB.39.19	or clothed its neck with a flowing mane?
JOB.39.20	Did you give it the ability to leap like a locust?
JOB.39.20	Its majestic snorting is terrifying!
JOB.39.21	It paws the earth and rejoices in its strength
JOB.39.21	when it charges out to battle.
JOB.39.22	It laughs at fear and is unafraid.
JOB.39.22	It does not run from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The arrows rattle against it,
JOB.39.23	and the spear and javelin flash.
JOB.39.24	It paws the ground fiercely
JOB.39.24	and rushes forward into battle when the ram’s horn blows.
JOB.39.25	It snorts at the sound of the horn.
JOB.39.25	It senses the battle in the distance.
JOB.39.25	It quivers at the captain’s commands and the noise of battle.
JOB.39.26	“Is it your wisdom that makes the hawk soar
JOB.39.26	and spread its wings toward the south?
JOB.39.27	Is it at your command that the eagle rises
JOB.39.27	to the heights to make its nest?
JOB.39.28	It lives on the cliffs,
JOB.39.28	making its home on a distant, rocky crag.
JOB.39.29	From there it hunts its prey,
JOB.39.29	keeping watch with piercing eyes.
JOB.39.30	Its young gulp down blood.
JOB.39.30	Where there’s a carcass, there you’ll find it.”
JOB.40.1	Then the 
JOB.40.2	“Do you still want to argue with the Almighty?
JOB.40.2	You are God’s critic, but do you have the answers?”
JOB.40.3	Then Job replied to the 
JOB.40.4	“I am nothing—how could I ever find the answers?
JOB.40.4	I will cover my mouth with my hand.
JOB.40.5	I have said too much already.
JOB.40.5	I have nothing more to say.”
JOB.40.6	Then the 
JOB.40.7	“Brace yourself like a man,
JOB.40.7	because I have some questions for you,
JOB.40.7	and you must answer them.
JOB.40.8	“Will you discredit my justice
JOB.40.8	and condemn me just to prove you are right?
JOB.40.9	Are you as strong as God?
JOB.40.9	Can you thunder with a voice like his?
JOB.40.10	All right, put on your glory and splendor,
JOB.40.10	your honor and majesty.
JOB.40.11	Give vent to your anger.
JOB.40.11	Let it overflow against the proud.
JOB.40.12	Humiliate the proud with a glance;
JOB.40.12	walk on the wicked where they stand.
JOB.40.13	Bury them in the dust.
JOB.40.13	Imprison them in the world of the dead.
JOB.40.14	Then even I would praise you,
JOB.40.14	for your own strength would save you.
JOB.40.15	“Take a look at Behemoth,
JOB.40.15	which I made, just as I made you.
JOB.40.15	It eats grass like an ox.
JOB.40.16	See its powerful loins
JOB.40.16	and the muscles of its belly.
JOB.40.17	Its tail is as strong as a cedar.
JOB.40.17	The sinews of its thighs are knit tightly together.
JOB.40.18	Its bones are tubes of bronze.
JOB.40.18	Its limbs are bars of iron.
JOB.40.19	It is a prime example of God’s handiwork,
JOB.40.19	and only its Creator can threaten it.
JOB.40.20	The mountains offer it their best food,
JOB.40.20	where all the wild animals play.
JOB.40.21	It lies under the lotus plants,
JOB.40.21	hidden by the reeds in the marsh.
JOB.40.22	The lotus plants give it shade
JOB.40.22	among the willows beside the stream.
JOB.40.23	It is not disturbed by the raging river,
JOB.40.23	not concerned when the swelling Jordan rushes around it.
JOB.40.24	No one can catch it off guard
JOB.40.24	or put a ring in its nose and lead it away.
JOB.41.1	“Can you catch Leviathan
JOB.41.1	or put a noose around its jaw?
JOB.41.2	Can you tie it with a rope through the nose
JOB.41.2	or pierce its jaw with a spike?
JOB.41.3	Will it beg you for mercy
JOB.41.3	or implore you for pity?
JOB.41.4	Will it agree to work for you,
JOB.41.4	to be your slave for life?
JOB.41.5	Can you make it a pet like a bird,
JOB.41.5	or give it to your little girls to play with?
JOB.41.6	Will merchants try to buy it
JOB.41.6	to sell it in their shops?
JOB.41.7	Will its hide be hurt by spears
JOB.41.7	or its head by a harpoon?
JOB.41.8	If you lay a hand on it,
JOB.41.8	you will certainly remember the battle that follows.
JOB.41.8	You won’t try that again!
JOB.41.9	No, it is useless to try to capture it.
JOB.41.9	The hunter who attempts it will be knocked down.
JOB.41.10	And since no one dares to disturb it,
JOB.41.10	who then can stand up to me?
JOB.41.11	Who has given me anything that I need to pay back?
JOB.41.11	Everything under heaven is mine.
JOB.41.12	“I want to emphasize Leviathan’s limbs
JOB.41.12	and its enormous strength and graceful form.
JOB.41.13	Who can strip off its hide,
JOB.41.13	and who can penetrate its double layer of armor?
JOB.41.14	Who could pry open its jaws?
JOB.41.14	For its teeth are terrible!
JOB.41.15	The scales on its back are like
JOB.41.15	tightly sealed together.
JOB.41.16	They are so close together
JOB.41.16	that no air can get between them.
JOB.41.17	Each scale sticks tight to the next.
JOB.41.17	They interlock and cannot be penetrated.
JOB.41.18	“When it sneezes, it flashes light!
JOB.41.18	Its eyes are like the red of dawn.
JOB.41.19	Lightning leaps from its mouth;
JOB.41.19	flames of fire flash out.
JOB.41.20	Smoke streams from its nostrils
JOB.41.20	like steam from a pot heated over burning rushes.
JOB.41.21	Its breath would kindle coals,
JOB.41.21	for flames shoot from its mouth.
JOB.41.22	“The tremendous strength in Leviathan’s neck
JOB.41.22	strikes terror wherever it goes.
JOB.41.23	Its flesh is hard and firm
JOB.41.23	and cannot be penetrated.
JOB.41.24	Its heart is hard as rock,
JOB.41.24	hard as a millstone.
JOB.41.25	When it rises, the mighty are afraid,
JOB.41.25	gripped by terror.
JOB.41.26	No sword can stop it,
JOB.41.26	no spear, dart, or javelin.
JOB.41.27	Iron is nothing but straw to that creature,
JOB.41.27	and bronze is like rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	Arrows cannot make it flee.
JOB.41.28	Stones shot from a sling are like bits of grass.
JOB.41.29	Clubs are like a blade of grass,
JOB.41.29	and it laughs at the swish of javelins.
JOB.41.30	Its belly is covered with scales as sharp as glass.
JOB.41.30	It plows up the ground as it drags through the mud.
JOB.41.31	“Leviathan makes the water boil with its commotion.
JOB.41.31	It stirs the depths like a pot of ointment.
JOB.41.32	The water glistens in its wake,
JOB.41.32	making the sea look white.
JOB.41.33	Nothing on earth is its equal,
JOB.41.33	no other creature so fearless.
JOB.41.34	Of all the creatures, it is the proudest.
JOB.41.34	It is the king of beasts.”
JOB.42.1	Then Job replied to the 
JOB.42.2	“I know that you can do anything,
JOB.42.2	and no one can stop you.
JOB.42.3	You asked, ‘Who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance?’
JOB.42.3	It is I—and I was talking about things I knew nothing about,
JOB.42.3	things far too wonderful for me.
JOB.42.4	You said, ‘Listen and I will speak!
JOB.42.4	I have some questions for you,
JOB.42.4	and you must answer them.’
JOB.42.5	I had only heard about you before,
JOB.42.5	but now I have seen you with my own eyes.
JOB.42.6	I take back everything I said,
JOB.42.6	and I sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance.”
JOB.42.7	After the 
JOB.42.8	So take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer on your behalf. I will not treat you as you deserve, for you have not spoken accurately about me, as my servant Job has.” 
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite did as the 
JOB.42.10	When Job prayed for his friends, the 
JOB.42.11	Then all his brothers, sisters, and former friends came and feasted with him in his home. And they consoled him and comforted him because of all the trials the 
JOB.42.12	So the 
JOB.42.13	He also gave Job seven more sons and three more daughters. 
JOB.42.14	He named his first daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. 
JOB.42.15	In all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of Job. And their father put them into his will along with their brothers.
JOB.42.16	Job lived 140 years after that, living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren. 
JOB.42.17	Then he died, an old man who had lived a long, full life.
PSA.1.1	Oh, the joys of those who do not
PSA.1.1	follow the advice of the wicked,
PSA.1.1	or stand around with sinners,
PSA.1.1	or join in with mockers.
PSA.1.2	But they delight in the law of the 
PSA.1.2	meditating on it day and night.
PSA.1.3	They are like trees planted along the riverbank,
PSA.1.3	bearing fruit each season.
PSA.1.3	Their leaves never wither,
PSA.1.3	and they prosper in all they do.
PSA.1.4	But not the wicked!
PSA.1.4	They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind.
PSA.1.5	They will be condemned at the time of judgment.
PSA.1.5	Sinners will have no place among the godly.
PSA.1.6	For the 
PSA.1.6	but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.
PSA.2.1	Why are the nations so angry?
PSA.2.1	Why do they waste their time with futile plans?
PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth prepare for battle;
PSA.2.2	the rulers plot together
PSA.2.2	against the 
PSA.2.2	and against his anointed one.
PSA.2.3	“Let us break their chains,” they cry,
PSA.2.3	“and free ourselves from slavery to God.”
PSA.2.4	But the one who rules in heaven laughs.
PSA.2.4	The Lord scoffs at them.
PSA.2.5	Then in anger he rebukes them,
PSA.2.5	terrifying them with his fierce fury.
PSA.2.6	For the Lord declares, “I have placed my chosen king on the throne
PSA.2.6	in Jerusalem,
PSA.2.7	The king proclaims the 
PSA.2.7	“The 
PSA.2.7	Today I have become your Father.
PSA.2.8	Only ask, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,
PSA.2.8	the whole earth as your possession.
PSA.2.9	You will break
PSA.2.9	and smash them like clay pots.’”
PSA.2.10	Now then, you kings, act wisely!
PSA.2.10	Be warned, you rulers of the earth!
PSA.2.11	Serve the 
PSA.2.11	and rejoice with trembling.
PSA.2.12	Submit to God’s royal son,
PSA.2.12	and you will be destroyed in the midst of all your activities—
PSA.2.12	for his anger flares up in an instant.
PSA.2.12	But what joy for all who take refuge in him!
PSA.3.1	O 
PSA.3.1	so many are against me.
PSA.3.2	So many are saying,
PSA.3.2	“God will never rescue him!”
PSA.3.2	Interlude
PSA.3.3	But you, O 
PSA.3.3	you are my glory, the one who holds my head high.
PSA.3.4	I cried out to the 
PSA.3.4	and he answered me from his holy mountain.
PSA.3.4	Interlude
PSA.3.5	I lay down and slept,
PSA.3.5	yet I woke up in safety,
PSA.3.5	for the 
PSA.3.6	I am not afraid of ten thousand enemies
PSA.3.6	who surround me on every side.
PSA.3.7	Arise, O 
PSA.3.7	Rescue me, my God!
PSA.3.7	Slap all my enemies in the face!
PSA.3.7	Shatter the teeth of the wicked!
PSA.3.8	Victory comes from you, O 
PSA.3.8	May you bless your people.
PSA.3.8	Interlude
PSA.4.1	Answer me when I call to you,
PSA.4.1	O God who declares me innocent.
PSA.4.1	Free me from my troubles.
PSA.4.1	Have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
PSA.4.2	How long will you people ruin my reputation?
PSA.4.2	How long will you make groundless accusations?
PSA.4.2	How long will you continue your lies?
PSA.4.2	Interlude
PSA.4.3	You can be sure of this:

PSA.4.5	and trust the 
PSA.4.6	Many people say, “Who will show us better times?”
PSA.4.6	Let your face smile on us, 
PSA.4.7	You have given me greater joy
PSA.4.7	than those who have abundant harvests of grain and new wine.
PSA.4.8	In peace I will lie down and sleep,
PSA.4.8	for you alone, O 
PSA.5.1	O 
PSA.5.1	pay attention to my groaning.
PSA.5.2	Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God,
PSA.5.2	for I pray to no one but you.
PSA.5.3	Listen to my voice in the morning, 
PSA.5.3	Each morning I bring my requests to you and wait expectantly.
PSA.5.4	O God, you take no pleasure in wickedness;
PSA.5.4	you cannot tolerate the sins of the wicked.
PSA.5.5	Therefore, the proud may not stand in your presence,
PSA.5.5	for you hate all who do evil.
PSA.5.6	You will destroy those who tell lies.
PSA.5.6	The 
PSA.5.7	Because of your unfailing love, I can enter your house;
PSA.5.7	I will worship at your Temple with deepest awe.
PSA.5.8	Lead me in the right path, O 
PSA.5.8	or my enemies will conquer me.
PSA.5.8	Make your way plain for me to follow.
PSA.5.9	My enemies cannot speak a truthful word.
PSA.5.9	Their deepest desire is to destroy others.
PSA.5.9	Their talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave.
PSA.5.9	Their tongues are filled with flattery.
PSA.5.10	O God, declare them guilty.
PSA.5.10	Let them be caught in their own traps.
PSA.5.10	Drive them away because of their many sins,
PSA.5.10	for they have rebelled against you.
PSA.5.11	But let all who take refuge in you rejoice;
PSA.5.11	let them sing joyful praises forever.
PSA.5.11	Spread your protection over them,
PSA.5.11	that all who love your name may be filled with joy.
PSA.5.12	For you bless the godly, O 
PSA.5.12	you surround them with your shield of love.
PSA.6.1	O 
PSA.6.1	or discipline me in your rage.
PSA.6.2	Have compassion on me, 
PSA.6.2	Heal me, 
PSA.6.3	I am sick at heart.
PSA.6.3	How long, O 
PSA.6.4	Return, O 
PSA.6.4	Save me because of your unfailing love.
PSA.6.5	For the dead do not remember you.
PSA.6.5	Who can praise you from the grave?
PSA.6.6	I am worn out from sobbing.
PSA.6.6	All night I flood my bed with weeping,
PSA.6.6	drenching it with my tears.
PSA.6.7	My vision is blurred by grief;
PSA.6.7	my eyes are worn out because of all my enemies.
PSA.6.8	Go away, all you who do evil,
PSA.6.8	for the

PSA.7.1	Save me from my persecutors—rescue me!
PSA.7.2	If you don’t, they will maul me like a lion,
PSA.7.2	tearing me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
PSA.7.3	O 
PSA.7.3	or am guilty of injustice,
PSA.7.4	if I have betrayed a friend
PSA.7.4	or plundered my enemy without cause,
PSA.7.5	then let my enemies capture me.

PSA.7.9	For you look deep within the mind and heart,
PSA.7.9	O righteous God.
PSA.7.10	God is my shield,
PSA.7.10	saving those whose hearts are true and right.
PSA.7.11	God is an honest judge.
PSA.7.11	He is angry with the wicked every day.
PSA.7.12	If a person does not repent,
PSA.7.12	God
PSA.7.12	he will bend and string his bow.
PSA.7.13	He will prepare his deadly weapons
PSA.7.13	and shoot his flaming arrows.
PSA.7.14	The wicked conceive evil;
PSA.7.14	they are pregnant with trouble
PSA.7.14	and give birth to lies.
PSA.7.15	They dig a deep pit to trap others,
PSA.7.15	then fall into it themselves.
PSA.7.16	The trouble they make for others backfires on them.
PSA.7.16	The violence they plan falls on their own heads.
PSA.7.17	I will thank the

PSA.8.2	silencing your enemies
PSA.8.2	and all who oppose you.
PSA.8.3	When I look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers—
PSA.8.3	the moon and the stars you set in place—
PSA.8.4	what are mere mortals that you should think about them,
PSA.8.4	human beings that you should care for them?
PSA.8.5	Yet you made them only a little lower than God
PSA.8.5	and crowned them
PSA.8.6	You gave them charge of everything you made,
PSA.8.6	putting all things under their authority—
PSA.8.7	the flocks and the herds
PSA.8.7	and all the wild animals,
PSA.8.8	the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea,
PSA.8.8	and everything that swims the ocean currents.
PSA.8.9	O 
PSA.9.1	I will praise you, 
PSA.9.1	I will tell of all the marvelous things you have done.
PSA.9.2	I will be filled with joy because of you.
PSA.9.2	I will sing praises to your name, O Most High.
PSA.9.3	My enemies retreated;
PSA.9.3	they staggered and died when you appeared.
PSA.9.4	For you have judged in my favor;
PSA.9.4	from your throne you have judged with fairness.
PSA.9.5	You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked;
PSA.9.5	you have erased their names forever.
PSA.9.6	The enemy is finished, in endless ruins;

PSA.9.13	Snatch me back from the jaws of death.
PSA.9.14	Save me so I can praise you publicly at Jerusalem’s gates,
PSA.9.14	so I can rejoice that you have rescued me.
PSA.9.15	The nations have fallen into the pit they dug for others.
PSA.9.15	Their own feet have been caught in the trap they set.

PSA.9.16	Quiet Interlude
PSA.9.17	The wicked will go down to the grave.
PSA.9.17	This is the fate of all the nations who ignore God.
PSA.9.18	But the needy will not be ignored forever;

PSA.9.20	Interlude
PSA.10.1	O 
PSA.10.1	Why do you hide when I am in trouble?
PSA.10.2	The wicked arrogantly hunt down the poor.
PSA.10.2	Let them be caught in the evil they plan for others.
PSA.10.3	For they brag about their evil desires;
PSA.10.3	they praise the greedy and curse the 
PSA.10.4	The wicked are too proud to seek God.
PSA.10.4	They seem to think that God is dead.
PSA.10.5	Yet they succeed in everything they do.
PSA.10.5	They do not see your punishment awaiting them.
PSA.10.5	They sneer at all their enemies.
PSA.10.6	They think, “Nothing bad will ever happen to us!
PSA.10.6	We will be free of trouble forever!”
PSA.10.7	Their mouths are full of cursing, lies, and threats.
PSA.10.7	Trouble and evil are on the tips of their tongues.
PSA.10.8	They lurk in ambush in the villages,
PSA.10.8	waiting to murder innocent people.
PSA.10.8	They are always searching for helpless victims.
PSA.10.9	Like lions crouched in hiding,
PSA.10.9	they wait to pounce on the helpless.
PSA.10.9	Like hunters they capture the helpless
PSA.10.9	and drag them away in nets.
PSA.10.10	Their helpless victims are crushed;
PSA.10.10	they fall beneath the strength of the wicked.
PSA.10.11	The wicked think, “God isn’t watching us!
PSA.10.11	He has closed his eyes and won’t even see what we do!”
PSA.10.12	Arise, O 
PSA.10.12	Punish the wicked, O God!
PSA.10.12	Do not ignore the helpless!
PSA.10.13	Why do the wicked get away with despising God?
PSA.10.13	They think, “God will never call us to account.”
PSA.10.14	But you see the trouble and grief they cause.
PSA.10.14	You take note of it and punish them.
PSA.10.14	The helpless put their trust in you.
PSA.10.14	You defend the orphans.
PSA.10.15	Break the arms of these wicked, evil people!
PSA.10.15	Go after them until the last one is destroyed.
PSA.10.16	The 
PSA.10.16	The godless nations will vanish from the land.
PSA.10.17	, you know the hopes of the helpless.
PSA.10.17	Surely you will hear their cries and comfort them.
PSA.10.18	You will bring justice to the orphans and the oppressed,
PSA.10.18	so mere people can no longer terrify them.
PSA.11.1	I trust in the 
PSA.11.1	So why do you say to me,
PSA.11.1	“Fly like a bird to the mountains for safety!
PSA.11.2	The wicked are stringing their bows
PSA.11.2	and fitting their arrows on the bowstrings.
PSA.11.2	They shoot from the shadows
PSA.11.2	at those whose hearts are right.
PSA.11.3	The foundations of law and order have collapsed.
PSA.11.3	What can the righteous do?”
PSA.11.4	But the 
PSA.11.4	the 
PSA.11.4	He watches everyone closely,
PSA.11.4	examining every person on earth.
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.5	He hates those who love violence.
PSA.11.6	He will rain down blazing coals and burning sulfur on the wicked,
PSA.11.6	punishing them with scorching winds.
PSA.11.7	For the righteous 
PSA.11.7	The virtuous will see his face.
PSA.12.1	Help, O 
PSA.12.1	The faithful have vanished from the earth!
PSA.12.2	Neighbors lie to each other,
PSA.12.2	speaking with flattering lips and deceitful hearts.
PSA.12.3	May the 
PSA.12.3	and silence their boastful tongues.
PSA.12.4	They say, “We will lie to our hearts’ content.
PSA.12.4	Our lips are our own—who can stop us?”
PSA.12.5	The 
PSA.12.5	and I have heard the groans of the poor.
PSA.12.5	Now I will rise up to rescue them,
PSA.12.5	as they have longed for me to do.”
PSA.12.6	The 
PSA.12.6	like silver refined in a furnace,
PSA.12.6	purified seven times over.
PSA.12.7	Therefore, 
PSA.12.7	preserving them forever from this lying generation,
PSA.12.8	even though the wicked strut about,
PSA.12.8	and evil is praised throughout the land.
PSA.13.1	O 
PSA.13.1	How long will you look the other way?
PSA.13.2	How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul,
PSA.13.2	with sorrow in my heart every day?
PSA.13.2	How long will my enemy have the upper hand?
PSA.13.3	Turn and answer me, O 
PSA.13.3	Restore the sparkle to my eyes, or I will die.
PSA.13.4	Don’t let my enemies gloat, saying, “We have defeated him!”
PSA.13.4	Don’t let them rejoice at my downfall.
PSA.13.5	But I trust in your unfailing love.
PSA.13.5	I will rejoice because you have rescued me.
PSA.13.6	I will sing to the 
PSA.13.6	because he is good to me.
PSA.14.1	Only fools say in their hearts,
PSA.14.1	“There is no God.”
PSA.14.1	They are corrupt, and their actions are evil;
PSA.14.1	not one of them does good!
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.2	on the entire human race;
PSA.14.2	he looks to see if anyone is truly wise,
PSA.14.2	if anyone seeks God.
PSA.14.3	But no, all have turned away;
PSA.14.3	all have become corrupt.
PSA.14.3	No one does good,
PSA.14.3	not a single one!
PSA.14.4	Will those who do evil never learn?
PSA.14.4	They eat up my people like bread
PSA.14.4	and wouldn’t think of praying to the 
PSA.14.5	Terror will grip them,
PSA.14.5	for God is with those who obey him.
PSA.14.6	The wicked frustrate the plans of the oppressed,
PSA.14.6	but the 
PSA.14.7	Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel?
PSA.14.7	When the 
PSA.14.7	Jacob will shout with joy, and Israel will rejoice.
PSA.15.1	Who may worship in your sanctuary, 
PSA.15.1	Who may enter your presence on your holy hill?
PSA.15.2	Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right,
PSA.15.2	speaking the truth from sincere hearts.
PSA.15.3	Those who refuse to gossip
PSA.15.3	or harm their neighbors
PSA.15.3	or speak evil of their friends.
PSA.15.4	Those who despise flagrant sinners,
PSA.15.4	and honor the faithful followers of the 
PSA.15.4	and keep their promises even when it hurts.
PSA.15.5	Those who lend money without charging interest,
PSA.15.5	and who cannot be bribed to lie about the innocent.
PSA.15.5	Such people will stand firm forever.
PSA.16.1	Keep me safe, O God,
PSA.16.1	for I have come to you for refuge.
PSA.16.2	I said to the 
PSA.16.2	Every good thing I have comes from you.”
PSA.16.3	The godly people in the land
PSA.16.3	are my true heroes!
PSA.16.3	I take pleasure in them!
PSA.16.4	Troubles multiply for those who chase after other gods.
PSA.16.4	I will not take part in their sacrifices of blood
PSA.16.4	or even speak the names of their gods.
PSA.16.5	, you alone are my inheritance, my cup of blessing.
PSA.16.5	You guard all that is mine.
PSA.16.6	The land you have given me is a pleasant land.
PSA.16.6	What a wonderful inheritance!
PSA.16.7	I will bless the 
PSA.16.7	even at night my heart instructs me.
PSA.16.8	I know the 
PSA.16.8	I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me.
PSA.16.9	No wonder my heart is glad, and I rejoice.
PSA.16.9	My body rests in safety.
PSA.16.10	For you will not leave my soul among the dead
PSA.16.10	or allow your holy one
PSA.16.11	You will show me the way of life,
PSA.16.11	granting me the joy of your presence
PSA.16.11	and the pleasures of living with you forever.
PSA.17.1	O 
PSA.17.1	Listen to my cry for help.
PSA.17.1	Pay attention to my prayer,
PSA.17.1	for it comes from honest lips.
PSA.17.2	Declare me innocent,
PSA.17.2	for you see those who do right.
PSA.17.3	You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night.
PSA.17.3	You have scrutinized me and found nothing wrong.
PSA.17.3	I am determined not to sin in what I say.
PSA.17.4	I have followed your commands,
PSA.17.4	which keep me from following cruel and evil people.
PSA.17.5	My steps have stayed on your path;
PSA.17.5	I have not wavered from following you.
PSA.17.6	I am praying to you because I know you will answer, O God.
PSA.17.6	Bend down and listen as I pray.
PSA.17.7	Show me your unfailing love in wonderful ways.
PSA.17.7	By your mighty power you rescue
PSA.17.7	those who seek refuge from their enemies.
PSA.17.8	Guard me as you would guard your own eyes.
PSA.17.8	Hide me in the shadow of your wings.
PSA.17.9	Protect me from wicked people who attack me,
PSA.17.9	from murderous enemies who surround me.
PSA.17.10	They are without pity.
PSA.17.10	Listen to their boasting!
PSA.17.11	They track me down and surround me,
PSA.17.11	watching for the chance to throw me to the ground.
PSA.17.12	They are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart—
PSA.17.12	like young lions hiding in ambush.
PSA.17.13	Arise, O 
PSA.17.13	Stand against them, and bring them to their knees!
PSA.17.13	Rescue me from the wicked with your sword!
PSA.17.14	By the power of your hand, O 
PSA.17.14	destroy those who look to this world for their reward.
PSA.17.14	But satisfy the hunger of your treasured ones.
PSA.17.14	May their children have plenty,
PSA.17.14	leaving an inheritance for their descendants.
PSA.17.15	Because I am righteous, I will see you.
PSA.17.15	When I awake, I will see you face to face and be satisfied.
PSA.18.1	I love you, 
PSA.18.1	you are my strength.
PSA.18.2	The 
PSA.18.2	my God is my rock, in whom I find protection.
PSA.18.2	He is my shield, the power that saves me,
PSA.18.2	and my place of safety.
PSA.18.3	I called on the 
PSA.18.3	and he saved me from my enemies.
PSA.18.4	The ropes of death entangled me;
PSA.18.4	floods of destruction swept over me.
PSA.18.5	The grave
PSA.18.5	death laid a trap in my path.
PSA.18.6	But in my distress I cried out to the 
PSA.18.6	yes, I prayed to my God for help.
PSA.18.6	He heard me from his sanctuary;
PSA.18.6	my cry to him reached his ears.
PSA.18.7	Then the earth quaked and trembled.
PSA.18.7	The foundations of the mountains shook;
PSA.18.7	they quaked because of his anger.
PSA.18.8	Smoke poured from his nostrils;
PSA.18.8	fierce flames leaped from his mouth.
PSA.18.8	Glowing coals blazed forth from him.
PSA.18.9	He opened the heavens and came down;
PSA.18.9	dark storm clouds were beneath his feet.
PSA.18.10	Mounted on a mighty angelic being,
PSA.18.10	soaring on the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He shrouded himself in darkness,
PSA.18.11	veiling his approach with dark rain clouds.
PSA.18.12	Thick clouds shielded the brightness around him
PSA.18.12	and rained down hail and burning coals.
PSA.18.13	The 
PSA.18.13	the voice of the Most High resounded
PSA.18.13	amid the hail and burning coals.
PSA.18.14	He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies;
PSA.18.14	great bolts of lightning flashed, and they were confused.
PSA.18.15	Then at your command, O 
PSA.18.15	at the blast of your breath,
PSA.18.15	the bottom of the sea could be seen,
PSA.18.15	and the foundations of the earth were laid bare.
PSA.18.16	He reached down from heaven and rescued me;
PSA.18.16	he drew me out of deep waters.
PSA.18.17	He rescued me from my powerful enemies,
PSA.18.17	from those who hated me and were too strong for me.
PSA.18.18	They attacked me at a moment when I was in distress,
PSA.18.18	but the 
PSA.18.19	He led me to a place of safety;
PSA.18.19	he rescued me because he delights in me.
PSA.18.20	The 
PSA.18.20	he restored me because of my innocence.
PSA.18.21	For I have kept the ways of the 
PSA.18.21	I have not turned from my God to follow evil.
PSA.18.22	I have followed all his regulations;
PSA.18.22	I have never abandoned his decrees.
PSA.18.23	I am blameless before God;
PSA.18.23	I have kept myself from sin.
PSA.18.24	The 
PSA.18.24	He has seen my innocence.
PSA.18.25	To the faithful you show yourself faithful;
PSA.18.25	to those with integrity you show integrity.
PSA.18.26	To the pure you show yourself pure,
PSA.18.26	but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.
PSA.18.27	You rescue the humble,
PSA.18.27	but you humiliate the proud.
PSA.18.28	You light a lamp for me.
PSA.18.28	The 
PSA.18.29	In your strength I can crush an army;
PSA.18.29	with my God I can scale any wall.
PSA.18.30	God’s way is perfect.
PSA.18.30	All the 
PSA.18.30	He is a shield for all who look to him for protection.
PSA.18.31	For who is God except the 
PSA.18.31	Who but our God is a solid rock?
PSA.18.32	God arms me with strength,
PSA.18.32	and he makes my way perfect.
PSA.18.33	He makes me as surefooted as a deer,
PSA.18.33	enabling me to stand on mountain heights.
PSA.18.34	He trains my hands for battle;
PSA.18.34	he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze bow.
PSA.18.35	You have given me your shield of victory.
PSA.18.35	Your right hand supports me;
PSA.18.35	your help
PSA.18.36	You have made a wide path for my feet
PSA.18.36	to keep them from slipping.
PSA.18.37	I chased my enemies and caught them;
PSA.18.37	I did not stop until they were conquered.
PSA.18.38	I struck them down so they could not get up;
PSA.18.38	they fell beneath my feet.
PSA.18.39	You have armed me with strength for the battle;
PSA.18.39	you have subdued my enemies under my feet.
PSA.18.40	You placed my foot on their necks.
PSA.18.40	I have destroyed all who hated me.
PSA.18.41	They called for help, but no one came to their rescue.
PSA.18.41	They even cried to the 
PSA.18.42	I ground them as fine as dust in the wind.
PSA.18.42	I swept them into the gutter like dirt.
PSA.18.43	You gave me victory over my accusers.
PSA.18.43	You appointed me ruler over nations;
PSA.18.43	people I don’t even know now serve me.
PSA.18.44	As soon as they hear of me, they submit;
PSA.18.44	foreign nations cringe before me.
PSA.18.45	They all lose their courage
PSA.18.45	and come trembling from their strongholds.
PSA.18.46	The 
PSA.18.46	May the God of my salvation be exalted!
PSA.18.47	He is the God who pays back those who harm me;
PSA.18.47	he subdues the nations under me
PSA.18.48	and rescues me from my enemies.
PSA.18.48	You hold me safe beyond the reach of my enemies;
PSA.18.48	you save me from violent opponents.
PSA.18.49	For this, O 
PSA.18.49	I will sing praises to your name.
PSA.18.50	You give great victories to your king;
PSA.18.50	you show unfailing love to your anointed,
PSA.18.50	to David and all his descendants forever.
PSA.19.1	The heavens proclaim the glory of God.
PSA.19.1	The skies display his craftsmanship.
PSA.19.2	Day after day they continue to speak;
PSA.19.2	night after night they make him known.
PSA.19.3	They speak without a sound or word;
PSA.19.3	their voice is never heard.
PSA.19.4	Yet their message has gone throughout the earth,
PSA.19.4	and their words to all the world.
PSA.19.4	God has made a home in the heavens for the sun.
PSA.19.5	It bursts forth like a radiant bridegroom after his wedding.
PSA.19.5	It rejoices like a great athlete eager to run the race.
PSA.19.6	The sun rises at one end of the heavens
PSA.19.6	and follows its course to the other end.
PSA.19.6	Nothing can hide from its heat.
PSA.19.7	The instructions of the 
PSA.19.7	reviving the soul.
PSA.19.7	The decrees of the 
PSA.19.7	making wise the simple.
PSA.19.8	The commandments of the

PSA.19.8	The commands of the 
PSA.19.8	giving insight for living.
PSA.19.9	Reverence for the 
PSA.19.9	lasting forever.
PSA.19.9	The laws of the 
PSA.19.9	each one is fair.
PSA.19.10	They are more desirable than gold,
PSA.19.10	even the finest gold.
PSA.19.10	They are sweeter than honey,
PSA.19.10	even honey dripping from the comb.
PSA.19.11	They are a warning to your servant,
PSA.19.11	a great reward for those who obey them.
PSA.19.12	How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart?
PSA.19.12	Cleanse me from these hidden faults.
PSA.19.13	Keep your servant from deliberate sins!
PSA.19.13	Don’t let them control me.
PSA.19.13	Then I will be free of guilt
PSA.19.13	and innocent of great sin.
PSA.19.14	May the words of my mouth
PSA.19.14	and the meditation of my heart
PSA.19.14	be pleasing to you,
PSA.19.14	O 
PSA.20.1	In times of trouble, may the 
PSA.20.1	May the name of the God of Jacob keep you safe from all harm.
PSA.20.2	May he send you help from his sanctuary
PSA.20.2	and strengthen you from Jerusalem.
PSA.20.3	May he remember all your gifts
PSA.20.3	and look favorably on your burnt offerings.
PSA.20.3	Interlude
PSA.20.4	May he grant your heart’s desires
PSA.20.4	and make all your plans succeed.
PSA.20.5	May we shout for joy when we hear of your victory
PSA.20.5	and raise a victory banner in the name of our God.
PSA.20.5	May the 
PSA.20.6	Now I know that the 
PSA.20.6	He will answer him from his holy heaven
PSA.20.6	and rescue him by his great power.
PSA.20.7	Some nations boast of their chariots and horses,
PSA.20.7	but we boast in the name of the 
PSA.20.8	Those nations will fall down and collapse,
PSA.20.8	but we will rise up and stand firm.
PSA.20.9	Give victory to our king, O 
PSA.20.9	Answer our cry for help.
PSA.21.1	How the king rejoices in your strength, O 
PSA.21.1	He shouts with joy because you give him victory.
PSA.21.2	For you have given him his heart’s desire;
PSA.21.2	you have withheld nothing he requested.
PSA.21.2	Interlude
PSA.21.3	You welcomed him back with success and prosperity.
PSA.21.3	You placed a crown of finest gold on his head.
PSA.21.4	He asked you to preserve his life,
PSA.21.4	and you granted his request.
PSA.21.4	The days of his life stretch on forever.
PSA.21.5	Your victory brings him great honor,
PSA.21.5	and you have clothed him with splendor and majesty.
PSA.21.6	You have endowed him with eternal blessings
PSA.21.6	and given him the joy of your presence.
PSA.21.7	For the king trusts in the 
PSA.21.7	The unfailing love of the Most High will keep him from stumbling.
PSA.21.8	You will capture all your enemies.
PSA.21.8	Your strong right hand will seize all who hate you.
PSA.21.9	You will throw them in a flaming furnace
PSA.21.9	when you appear.
PSA.21.9	The 
PSA.21.9	fire will devour them.
PSA.21.10	You will wipe their children from the face of the earth;
PSA.21.10	they will never have descendants.
PSA.21.11	Although they plot against you,
PSA.21.11	their evil schemes will never succeed.
PSA.21.12	For they will turn and run
PSA.21.12	when they see your arrows aimed at them.
PSA.21.13	Rise up, O 
PSA.21.13	With music and singing we celebrate your mighty acts.
PSA.22.1	My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?
PSA.22.1	Why are you so far away when I groan for help?
PSA.22.2	Every day I call to you, my God, but you do not answer.
PSA.22.2	Every night I lift my voice, but I find no relief.
PSA.22.3	Yet you are holy,
PSA.22.3	enthroned on the praises of Israel.
PSA.22.4	Our ancestors trusted in you,
PSA.22.4	and you rescued them.
PSA.22.5	They cried out to you and were saved.
PSA.22.5	They trusted in you and were never disgraced.
PSA.22.6	But I am a worm and not a man.
PSA.22.6	I am scorned and despised by all!
PSA.22.7	Everyone who sees me mocks me.
PSA.22.7	They sneer and shake their heads, saying,
PSA.22.8	“Is this the one who relies on the 
PSA.22.8	Then let the 
PSA.22.8	If the 
PSA.22.8	let the 
PSA.22.9	Yet you brought me safely from my mother’s womb
PSA.22.9	and led me to trust you at my mother’s breast.
PSA.22.10	I was thrust into your arms at my birth.
PSA.22.10	You have been my God from the moment I was born.
PSA.22.11	Do not stay so far from me,
PSA.22.11	for trouble is near,
PSA.22.11	and no one else can help me.
PSA.22.12	My enemies surround me like a herd of bulls;
PSA.22.12	fierce bulls of Bashan have hemmed me in!
PSA.22.13	Like lions they open their jaws against me,
PSA.22.13	roaring and tearing into their prey.
PSA.22.14	My life is poured out like water,
PSA.22.14	and all my bones are out of joint.
PSA.22.14	My heart is like wax,
PSA.22.14	melting within me.
PSA.22.15	My strength has dried up like sunbaked clay.
PSA.22.15	My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.
PSA.22.15	You have laid me in the dust and left me for dead.
PSA.22.16	My enemies surround me like a pack of dogs;
PSA.22.16	an evil gang closes in on me.
PSA.22.16	They have pierced
PSA.22.17	I can count all my bones.
PSA.22.17	My enemies stare at me and gloat.
PSA.22.18	They divide my garments among themselves
PSA.22.18	and throw dice
PSA.22.19	O 
PSA.22.19	You are my strength; come quickly to my aid!
PSA.22.20	Save me from the sword;
PSA.22.20	spare my precious life from these dogs.
PSA.22.21	Snatch me from the lion’s jaws
PSA.22.21	and from the horns of these wild oxen.
PSA.22.22	I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters.
PSA.22.22	I will praise you among your assembled people.
PSA.22.23	Praise the 
PSA.22.23	Honor him, all you descendants of Jacob!
PSA.22.23	Show him reverence, all you descendants of Israel!
PSA.22.24	For he has not ignored or belittled the suffering of the needy.
PSA.22.24	He has not turned his back on them,
PSA.22.24	but has listened to their cries for help.
PSA.22.25	I will praise you in the great assembly.
PSA.22.25	I will fulfill my vows in the presence of those who worship you.
PSA.22.26	The poor will eat and be satisfied.
PSA.22.26	All who seek the 
PSA.22.26	Their hearts will rejoice with everlasting joy.
PSA.22.27	The whole earth will acknowledge the 
PSA.22.27	All the families of the nations will bow down before him.
PSA.22.28	For royal power belongs to the 
PSA.22.28	He rules all the nations.
PSA.22.29	Let the rich of the earth feast and worship.
PSA.22.29	Bow before him, all who are mortal,
PSA.22.29	all whose lives will end as dust.
PSA.22.30	Our children will also serve him.
PSA.22.30	Future generations will hear about the wonders of the Lord.
PSA.22.31	His righteous acts will be told to those not yet born.
PSA.22.31	They will hear about everything he has done.
PSA.23.1	The 
PSA.23.1	I have all that I need.
PSA.23.2	He lets me rest in green meadows;
PSA.23.2	he leads me beside peaceful streams.
PSA.23.3	He renews my strength.
PSA.23.3	He guides me along right paths,
PSA.23.3	bringing honor to his name.
PSA.23.4	Even when I walk
PSA.23.4	through the darkest valley,
PSA.23.4	I will not be afraid,
PSA.23.4	for you are close beside me.
PSA.23.4	Your rod and your staff

PSA.30.6	“Nothing can stop me now!”
PSA.30.7	Your favor, O 
PSA.30.7	Then you turned away from me, and I was shattered.
PSA.30.8	I cried out to you, O 
PSA.30.8	I begged the Lord for mercy, saying,
PSA.30.9	“What will you gain if I die,
PSA.30.9	if I sink into the grave?
PSA.30.9	Can my dust praise you?
PSA.30.9	Can it tell of your faithfulness?

PSA.30.10	Help me, O 
PSA.30.11	You have turned my mourning into joyful dancing.
PSA.30.11	You have taken away my clothes of mourning and clothed me with joy,
PSA.30.12	that I might sing praises to you and not be silent.

PSA.31.8	but have set me in a safe place.
PSA.31.9	Have mercy on me, 
PSA.31.9	Tears blur my eyes.
PSA.31.9	My body and soul are withering away.
PSA.31.10	I am dying from grief;
PSA.31.10	my years are shortened by sadness.
PSA.31.10	Sin has drained my strength;
PSA.31.10	I am wasting away from within.
PSA.31.11	I am scorned by all my enemies
PSA.31.11	and despised by my neighbors—
PSA.31.11	even my friends are afraid to come near me.
PSA.31.11	When they see me on the street,
PSA.31.11	they run the other way.
PSA.31.12	I am ignored as if I were dead,
PSA.31.12	as if I were a broken pot.
PSA.31.13	I have heard the many rumors about me,
PSA.31.13	and I am surrounded by terror.
PSA.31.13	My enemies conspire against me,
PSA.31.13	plotting to take my life.
PSA.31.14	But I am trusting you, O 
PSA.31.14	saying, “You are my God!”
PSA.31.15	My future is in your hands.

PSA.31.17	for I call out to you for help.
PSA.31.17	Let the wicked be disgraced;
PSA.31.17	let them lie silent in the grave.
PSA.31.18	Silence their lying lips—
PSA.31.18	those proud and arrogant lips that accuse the godly.
PSA.31.19	How great is the goodness
PSA.31.19	you have stored up for those who fear you.
PSA.31.19	You lavish it on those who come to you for protection,
PSA.31.19	blessing them before the watching world.
PSA.31.20	You hide them in the shelter of your presence,
PSA.31.20	safe from those who conspire against them.
PSA.31.20	You shelter them in your presence,
PSA.31.20	far from accusing tongues.
PSA.31.21	Praise the 
PSA.31.21	for he has shown me the wonders of his unfailing love.
PSA.31.21	He kept me safe when my city was under attack.
PSA.31.22	In panic I cried out,
PSA.31.22	“I am cut off from the 
PSA.31.22	But you heard my cry for mercy
PSA.31.22	and answered my call for help.
PSA.31.23	Love the

PSA.32.1	whose disobedience is forgiven,
PSA.32.1	whose sin is put out of sight!
PSA.32.2	Yes, what joy for those
PSA.32.2	whose record the 
PSA.32.2	whose lives are lived in complete honesty!
PSA.32.3	When I refused to confess my sin,
PSA.32.3	my body wasted away,
PSA.32.3	and I groaned all day long.
PSA.32.4	Day and night your hand of discipline was heavy on me.
PSA.32.4	My strength evaporated like water in the summer heat.
PSA.32.4	Interlude
PSA.32.5	Finally, I confessed all my sins to you
PSA.32.5	and stopped trying to hide my guilt.
PSA.32.5	I said to myself, “I will confess my rebellion to the 
PSA.32.5	And you forgave me! All my guilt is gone.
PSA.32.5	Interlude
PSA.32.6	Therefore, let all the godly pray to you while there is still time,
PSA.32.6	that they may not drown in the floodwaters of judgment.
PSA.32.7	For you are my hiding place;
PSA.32.7	you protect me from trouble.
PSA.32.7	You surround me with songs of victory.
PSA.32.7	Interlude
PSA.32.8	The 
PSA.32.8	I will advise you and watch over you.
PSA.32.9	Do not be like a senseless horse or mule
PSA.32.9	that needs a bit and bridle to keep it under control.”
PSA.32.10	Many sorrows come to the wicked,
PSA.32.10	but unfailing love surrounds those who trust the 
PSA.32.11	So rejoice in the 
PSA.32.11	Shout for joy, all you whose hearts are pure!
PSA.33.1	Let the godly sing for joy to the

PSA.33.2	Praise the 
PSA.33.2	make music for him on the ten-stringed harp.
PSA.33.3	Sing a new song of praise to him;
PSA.33.3	play skillfully on the harp, and sing with joy.
PSA.33.4	For the word of the 
PSA.33.4	and we can trust everything he does.
PSA.33.5	He loves whatever is just and good;
PSA.33.5	the unfailing love of the 
PSA.33.6	The 
PSA.33.6	and the heavens were created.
PSA.33.6	He breathed the word,
PSA.33.6	and all the stars were born.
PSA.33.7	He assigned the sea its boundaries
PSA.33.7	and locked the oceans in vast reservoirs.
PSA.33.8	Let the whole world fear the 
PSA.33.8	and let everyone stand in awe of him.
PSA.33.9	For when he spoke, the world began!
PSA.33.9	It appeared at his command.
PSA.33.10	The 
PSA.33.10	and thwarts all their schemes.
PSA.33.11	But the 
PSA.33.11	his intentions can never be shaken.

PSA.33.13	and sees the whole human race.
PSA.33.14	From his throne he observes
PSA.33.14	all who live on the earth.
PSA.33.15	He made their hearts,
PSA.33.15	so he understands everything they do.
PSA.33.16	The best-equipped army cannot save a king,
PSA.33.16	nor is great strength enough to save a warrior.
PSA.33.17	Don’t count on your warhorse to give you victory—
PSA.33.17	for all its strength, it cannot save you.
PSA.33.18	But the 
PSA.33.18	those who rely on his unfailing love.
PSA.33.19	He rescues them from death
PSA.33.19	and keeps them alive in times of famine.
PSA.33.20	We put our hope in the 
PSA.33.20	He is our help and our shield.
PSA.33.21	In him our hearts rejoice,
PSA.33.21	for we trust in his holy name.
PSA.33.22	Let your unfailing love surround us, 
PSA.33.22	for our hope is in you alone.
PSA.34.1	I will praise the 
PSA.34.1	I will constantly speak his praises.
PSA.34.2	I will boast only in the 
PSA.34.2	let all who are helpless take heart.
PSA.34.3	Come, let us tell of the 
PSA.34.3	let us exalt his name together.
PSA.34.4	I prayed to the 
PSA.34.4	He freed me from all my fears.
PSA.34.5	Those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy;
PSA.34.5	no shadow of shame will darken their faces.
PSA.34.6	In my desperation I prayed, and the 
PSA.34.6	he saved me from all my troubles.
PSA.34.7	For the angel of the 
PSA.34.7	he surrounds and defends all who fear him.
PSA.34.8	Taste and see that the 
PSA.34.8	Oh, the joys of those who take refuge in him!
PSA.34.9	Fear the 
PSA.34.9	for those who fear him will have all they need.
PSA.34.10	Even strong young lions sometimes go hungry,
PSA.34.10	but those who trust in the 
PSA.34.11	Come, my children, and listen to me,
PSA.34.11	and I will teach you to fear the 
PSA.34.12	Does anyone want to live a life
PSA.34.12	that is long and prosperous?
PSA.34.13	Then keep your tongue from speaking evil
PSA.34.13	and your lips from telling lies!
PSA.34.14	Turn away from evil and do good.
PSA.34.14	Search for peace, and work to maintain it.
PSA.34.15	The eyes of the 
PSA.34.15	his ears are open to their cries for help.
PSA.34.16	But the 
PSA.34.16	he will erase their memory from the earth.
PSA.34.17	The 
PSA.34.17	He rescues them from all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.18	he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.
PSA.34.19	The righteous person faces many troubles,
PSA.34.19	but the 
PSA.34.20	For the 
PSA.34.20	not one of them is broken!
PSA.34.21	Calamity will surely destroy the wicked,
PSA.34.21	and those who hate the righteous will be punished.
PSA.34.22	But the 
PSA.34.22	No one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.
PSA.35.1	O 
PSA.35.1	Fight those who fight against me.
PSA.35.2	Put on your armor, and take up your shield.
PSA.35.2	Prepare for battle, and come to my aid.
PSA.35.3	Lift up your spear and javelin
PSA.35.3	against those who pursue me.
PSA.35.3	Let me hear you say,
PSA.35.3	“I will give you victory!”
PSA.35.4	Bring shame and disgrace on those trying to kill me;
PSA.35.4	turn them back and humiliate those who want to harm me.
PSA.35.5	Blow them away like chaff in the wind—
PSA.35.5	a wind sent by the angel of the 
PSA.35.6	Make their path dark and slippery,
PSA.35.6	with the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	I did them no wrong, but they laid a trap for me.
PSA.35.7	I did them no wrong, but they dug a pit to catch me.
PSA.35.8	So let sudden ruin come upon them!
PSA.35.8	Let them be caught in the trap they set for me!
PSA.35.8	Let them be destroyed in the pit they dug for me.
PSA.35.9	Then I will rejoice in the 
PSA.35.9	I will be glad because he rescues me.
PSA.35.10	With every bone in my body I will praise him:
PSA.35.10	“
PSA.35.10	Who else rescues the helpless from the strong?
PSA.35.10	Who else protects the helpless and poor from those who rob them?”
PSA.35.11	Malicious witnesses testify against me.
PSA.35.11	They accuse me of crimes I know nothing about.
PSA.35.12	They repay me evil for good.
PSA.35.12	I am sick with despair.
PSA.35.13	Yet when they were ill, I grieved for them.
PSA.35.13	I denied myself by fasting for them,
PSA.35.13	but my prayers returned unanswered.
PSA.35.14	I was sad, as though they were my friends or family,
PSA.35.14	as if I were grieving for my own mother.
PSA.35.15	But they are glad now that I am in trouble;
PSA.35.15	they gleefully join together against me.
PSA.35.15	I am attacked by people I don’t even know;
PSA.35.15	they slander me constantly.
PSA.35.16	They mock me and call me names;
PSA.35.16	they snarl at me.
PSA.35.17	How long, O Lord, will you look on and do nothing?
PSA.35.17	Rescue me from their fierce attacks.
PSA.35.17	Protect my life from these lions!
PSA.35.18	Then I will thank you in front of the great assembly.
PSA.35.18	I will praise you before all the people.
PSA.35.19	Don’t let my treacherous enemies rejoice over my defeat.
PSA.35.19	Don’t let those who hate me without cause gloat over my sorrow.
PSA.35.20	They don’t talk of peace;
PSA.35.20	they plot against innocent people who mind their own business.
PSA.35.21	They shout, “Aha! Aha!
PSA.35.21	With our own eyes we saw him do it!”
PSA.35.22	O 
PSA.35.22	Do not stay silent.
PSA.35.22	Do not abandon me now, O Lord.
PSA.35.23	Wake up! Rise to my defense!
PSA.35.23	Take up my case, my God and my Lord.
PSA.35.24	Declare me not guilty, O 
PSA.35.24	Don’t let my enemies laugh about me in my troubles.
PSA.35.25	Don’t let them say, “Look, we got what we wanted!
PSA.35.25	Now we will eat him alive!”
PSA.35.26	May those who rejoice at my troubles
PSA.35.26	be humiliated and disgraced.
PSA.35.26	May those who triumph over me
PSA.35.26	be covered with shame and dishonor.
PSA.35.27	But give great joy to those who came to my defense.
PSA.35.27	Let them continually say, “Great is the 
PSA.35.27	who delights in blessing his servant with peace!”
PSA.35.28	Then I will proclaim your justice,
PSA.35.28	and I will praise you all day long.
PSA.36.1	Sin whispers to the wicked, deep within their hearts.
PSA.36.1	They have no fear of God at all.
PSA.36.2	In their blind conceit,
PSA.36.2	they cannot see how wicked they really are.
PSA.36.3	Everything they say is crooked and deceitful.
PSA.36.3	They refuse to act wisely or do good.
PSA.36.4	They lie awake at night, hatching sinful plots.
PSA.36.4	Their actions are never good.
PSA.36.4	They make no attempt to turn from evil.
PSA.36.5	Your unfailing love, O 
PSA.36.5	your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds.
PSA.36.6	Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains,
PSA.36.6	your justice like the ocean depths.
PSA.36.6	You care for people and animals alike, O 
PSA.36.7	How precious is your unfailing love, O God!
PSA.36.7	All humanity finds shelter
PSA.36.7	in the shadow of your wings.
PSA.36.8	You feed them from the abundance of your own house,
PSA.36.8	letting them drink from your river of delights.
PSA.36.9	For you are the fountain of life,
PSA.36.9	the light by which we see.
PSA.36.10	Pour out your unfailing love on those who love you;
PSA.36.10	give justice to those with honest hearts.
PSA.36.11	Don’t let the proud trample me
PSA.36.11	or the wicked push me around.
PSA.36.12	Look! Those who do evil have fallen!
PSA.36.12	They are thrown down, never to rise again.
PSA.37.1	Don’t worry about the wicked
PSA.37.1	or envy those who do wrong.
PSA.37.2	For like grass, they soon fade away.
PSA.37.2	Like spring flowers, they soon wither.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.3	Then you will live safely in the land and prosper.
PSA.37.4	Take delight in the 
PSA.37.4	and he will give you your heart’s desires.
PSA.37.5	Commit everything you do to the 
PSA.37.5	Trust him, and he will help you.
PSA.37.6	He will make your innocence radiate like the dawn,
PSA.37.6	and the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun.
PSA.37.7	Be still in the presence of the 
PSA.37.7	and wait patiently for him to act.
PSA.37.7	Don’t worry about evil people who prosper
PSA.37.7	or fret about their wicked schemes.
PSA.37.8	Stop being angry!
PSA.37.8	Turn from your rage!
PSA.37.8	Do not lose your temper—
PSA.37.8	it only leads to harm.
PSA.37.9	For the wicked will be destroyed,
PSA.37.9	but those who trust in the 
PSA.37.10	Soon the wicked will disappear.
PSA.37.10	Though you look for them, they will be gone.
PSA.37.11	The lowly will possess the land
PSA.37.11	and will live in peace and prosperity.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plot against the godly;
PSA.37.12	they snarl at them in defiance.
PSA.37.13	But the Lord just laughs,
PSA.37.13	for he sees their day of judgment coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked draw their swords
PSA.37.14	and string their bows
PSA.37.14	to kill the poor and the oppressed,
PSA.37.14	to slaughter those who do right.
PSA.37.15	But their swords will stab their own hearts,
PSA.37.15	and their bows will be broken.
PSA.37.16	It is better to be godly and have little
PSA.37.16	than to be evil and rich.
PSA.37.17	For the strength of the wicked will be shattered,
PSA.37.17	but the 
PSA.37.18	Day by day the 
PSA.37.18	and they will receive an inheritance that lasts forever.
PSA.37.19	They will not be disgraced in hard times;
PSA.37.19	even in famine they will have more than enough.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked will die.
PSA.37.20	The 
PSA.37.20	they will disappear like smoke.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrow and never repay,
PSA.37.21	but the godly are generous givers.
PSA.37.22	Those the 
PSA.37.22	but those he curses will die.
PSA.37.23	The 
PSA.37.23	He delights in every detail of their lives.
PSA.37.24	Though they stumble, they will never fall,
PSA.37.24	for the 
PSA.37.25	Once I was young, and now I am old.
PSA.37.25	Yet I have never seen the godly abandoned
PSA.37.25	or their children begging for bread.
PSA.37.26	The godly always give generous loans to others,
PSA.37.26	and their children are a blessing.
PSA.37.27	Turn from evil and do good,
PSA.37.27	and you will live in the land forever.
PSA.37.28	For the 
PSA.37.28	and he will never abandon the godly.
PSA.37.28	He will keep them safe forever,
PSA.37.28	but the children of the wicked will die.
PSA.37.29	The godly will possess the land
PSA.37.29	and will live there forever.
PSA.37.30	The godly offer good counsel;
PSA.37.30	they teach right from wrong.
PSA.37.31	They have made God’s law their own,
PSA.37.31	so they will never slip from his path.
PSA.37.32	The wicked wait in ambush for the godly,
PSA.37.32	looking for an excuse to kill them.
PSA.37.33	But the 
PSA.37.33	or let the godly be condemned when they are put on trial.
PSA.37.34	Put your hope in the 
PSA.37.34	Travel steadily along his path.
PSA.37.34	He will honor you by giving you the land.
PSA.37.34	You will see the wicked destroyed.
PSA.37.35	I have seen wicked and ruthless people
PSA.37.35	flourishing like a tree in its native soil.
PSA.37.36	But when I looked again, they were gone!
PSA.37.36	Though I searched for them, I could not find them!
PSA.37.37	Look at those who are honest and good,
PSA.37.37	for a wonderful future awaits those who love peace.
PSA.37.38	But the rebellious will be destroyed;
PSA.37.38	they have no future.
PSA.37.39	The 
PSA.37.39	he is their fortress in times of trouble.
PSA.37.40	The 
PSA.37.40	rescuing them from the wicked.
PSA.37.40	He saves them,
PSA.37.40	and they find shelter in him.
PSA.38.1	O 
PSA.38.1	or discipline me in your rage!
PSA.38.2	Your arrows have struck deep,
PSA.38.2	and your blows are crushing me.
PSA.38.3	Because of your anger, my whole body is sick;
PSA.38.3	my health is broken because of my sins.
PSA.38.4	My guilt overwhelms me—
PSA.38.4	it is a burden too heavy to bear.
PSA.38.5	My wounds fester and stink
PSA.38.5	because of my foolish sins.
PSA.38.6	I am bent over and racked with pain.
PSA.38.6	All day long I walk around filled with grief.
PSA.38.7	A raging fever burns within me,
PSA.38.7	and my health is broken.
PSA.38.8	I am exhausted and completely crushed.
PSA.38.8	My groans come from an anguished heart.
PSA.38.9	You know what I long for, Lord;
PSA.38.9	you hear my every sigh.
PSA.38.10	My heart beats wildly, my strength fails,
PSA.38.10	and I am going blind.
PSA.38.11	My loved ones and friends stay away, fearing my disease.
PSA.38.11	Even my own family stands at a distance.
PSA.38.12	Meanwhile, my enemies lay traps to kill me.
PSA.38.12	Those who wish me harm make plans to ruin me.
PSA.38.12	All day long they plan their treachery.
PSA.38.13	But I am deaf to all their threats.
PSA.38.13	I am silent before them as one who cannot speak.
PSA.38.14	I choose to hear nothing,
PSA.38.14	and I make no reply.
PSA.38.15	For I am waiting for you, O 
PSA.38.15	You must answer for me, O Lord my God.
PSA.38.16	I prayed, “Don’t let my enemies gloat over me
PSA.38.16	or rejoice at my downfall.”
PSA.38.17	I am on the verge of collapse,
PSA.38.17	facing constant pain.
PSA.38.18	But I confess my sins;
PSA.38.18	I am deeply sorry for what I have done.
PSA.38.19	I have many aggressive enemies;
PSA.38.19	they hate me without reason.
PSA.38.20	They repay me evil for good
PSA.38.20	and oppose me for pursuing good.
PSA.38.21	Do not abandon me, O 
PSA.38.21	Do not stand at a distance, my God.
PSA.38.22	Come quickly to help me,
PSA.38.22	O Lord my savior.
PSA.39.1	I said to myself, “I will watch what I do
PSA.39.1	and not sin in what I say.
PSA.39.1	I will hold my tongue
PSA.39.1	when the ungodly are around me.”
PSA.39.2	But as I stood there in silence—
PSA.39.2	not even speaking of good things—
PSA.39.2	the turmoil within me grew worse.
PSA.39.3	The more I thought about it,
PSA.39.3	the hotter I got,
PSA.39.3	igniting a fire of words:
PSA.39.4	“
PSA.39.4	Remind me that my days are numbered—
PSA.39.4	how fleeting my life is.
PSA.39.5	You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand.
PSA.39.5	My entire lifetime is just a moment to you;
PSA.39.5	at best, each of us is but a breath.”
PSA.39.5	Interlude
PSA.39.6	We are merely moving shadows,
PSA.39.6	and all our busy rushing ends in nothing.
PSA.39.6	We heap up wealth,
PSA.39.6	not knowing who will spend it.
PSA.39.7	And so, Lord, where do I put my hope?
PSA.39.7	My only hope is in you.
PSA.39.8	Rescue me from my rebellion.
PSA.39.8	Do not let fools mock me.
PSA.39.9	I am silent before you; I won’t say a word,
PSA.39.9	for my punishment is from you.
PSA.39.10	But please stop striking me!
PSA.39.10	I am exhausted by the blows from your hand.
PSA.39.11	When you discipline us for our sins,
PSA.39.11	you consume like a moth what is precious to us.
PSA.39.11	Each of us is but a breath.
PSA.39.11	Interlude
PSA.39.12	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.39.12	Listen to my cries for help!
PSA.39.12	Don’t ignore my tears.
PSA.39.12	For I am your guest—
PSA.39.12	a traveler passing through,
PSA.39.12	as my ancestors were before me.
PSA.39.13	Leave me alone so I can smile again
PSA.39.13	before I am gone and exist no more.
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the 
PSA.40.1	and he turned to me and heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He lifted me out of the pit of despair,
PSA.40.2	out of the mud and the mire.
PSA.40.2	He set my feet on solid ground
PSA.40.2	and steadied me as I walked along.
PSA.40.3	He has given me a new song to sing,
PSA.40.3	a hymn of praise to our God.
PSA.40.3	Many will see what he has done and be amazed.
PSA.40.3	They will put their trust in the 
PSA.40.4	Oh, the joys of those who trust the 
PSA.40.4	who have no confidence in the proud
PSA.40.4	or in those who worship idols.
PSA.40.5	O 
PSA.40.5	Your plans for us are too numerous to list.
PSA.40.5	You have no equal.
PSA.40.5	If I tried to recite all your wonderful deeds,
PSA.40.5	I would never come to the end of them.
PSA.40.6	You take no delight in sacrifices or offerings.
PSA.40.6	Now that you have made me listen, I finally understand
PSA.40.6	you don’t require burnt offerings or sin offerings.
PSA.40.7	Then I said, “Look, I have come.
PSA.40.7	As is written about me in the Scriptures:
PSA.40.8	I take joy in doing your will, my God,
PSA.40.8	for your instructions are written on my heart.”
PSA.40.9	I have told all your people about your justice.
PSA.40.9	I have not been afraid to speak out,
PSA.40.9	as you, O 
PSA.40.10	I have not kept the good news of your justice hidden in my heart;
PSA.40.10	I have talked about your faithfulness and saving power.
PSA.40.10	I have told everyone in the great assembly
PSA.40.10	of your unfailing love and faithfulness.
PSA.40.11	, don’t hold back your tender mercies from me.
PSA.40.11	Let your unfailing love and faithfulness always protect me.
PSA.40.12	For troubles surround me—
PSA.40.12	too many to count!
PSA.40.12	My sins pile up so high
PSA.40.12	I can’t see my way out.
PSA.40.12	They outnumber the hairs on my head.
PSA.40.12	I have lost all courage.
PSA.40.13	Please, 
PSA.40.13	Come quickly, 
PSA.40.14	May those who try to destroy me
PSA.40.14	be humiliated and put to shame.
PSA.40.14	May those who take delight in my trouble
PSA.40.14	be turned back in disgrace.
PSA.40.15	Let them be horrified by their shame,
PSA.40.15	for they said, “Aha! We’ve got him now!”
PSA.40.16	But may all who search for you
PSA.40.16	be filled with joy and gladness in you.
PSA.40.16	May those who love your salvation
PSA.40.16	repeatedly shout, “The 
PSA.40.17	As for me, since I am poor and needy,
PSA.40.17	let the Lord keep me in his thoughts.
PSA.40.17	You are my helper and my savior.
PSA.40.17	O my God, do not delay.
PSA.41.1	Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor!
PSA.41.1	The 
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.2	and keeps them alive.
PSA.41.2	He gives them prosperity in the land
PSA.41.2	and rescues them from their enemies.
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.3	and restores them to health.
PSA.41.4	“O 
PSA.41.4	Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
PSA.41.5	But my enemies say nothing but evil about me.
PSA.41.5	“How soon will he die and be forgotten?” they ask.
PSA.41.6	They visit me as if they were my friends,
PSA.41.6	but all the while they gather gossip,
PSA.41.6	and when they leave, they spread it everywhere.
PSA.41.7	All who hate me whisper about me,
PSA.41.7	imagining the worst.
PSA.41.8	“He has some fatal disease,” they say.
PSA.41.8	“He will never get out of that bed!”
PSA.41.9	Even my best friend, the one I trusted completely,
PSA.41.9	the one who shared my food, has turned against me.
PSA.41.10	, have mercy on me.
PSA.41.10	Make me well again, so I can pay them back!
PSA.41.11	I know you are pleased with me,
PSA.41.11	for you have not let my enemies triumph over me.
PSA.41.12	You have preserved my life because I am innocent;
PSA.41.12	you have brought me into your presence forever.
PSA.41.13	Praise the 
PSA.41.13	who lives from everlasting to everlasting.
PSA.41.13	Amen and amen!
PSA.42.1	As the deer longs for streams of water,
PSA.42.1	so I long for you, O God.
PSA.42.2	I thirst for God, the living God.
PSA.42.2	When can I go and stand before him?
PSA.42.3	Day and night I have only tears for food,
PSA.42.3	while my enemies continually taunt me, saying,
PSA.42.3	“Where is this God of yours?”
PSA.42.4	My heart is breaking
PSA.42.4	as I remember how it used to be:
PSA.42.4	I walked among the crowds of worshipers,
PSA.42.4	leading a great procession to the house of God,
PSA.42.4	singing for joy and giving thanks
PSA.42.4	amid the sound of a great celebration!
PSA.42.5	Why am I discouraged?
PSA.42.5	Why is my heart so sad?
PSA.42.5	I will put my hope in God!
PSA.42.5	I will praise him again—
PSA.42.5	my Savior and 
PSA.42.6	my God! 
PSA.42.6	Now I am deeply discouraged,
PSA.42.6	but I will remember you—
PSA.42.6	even from distant Mount Hermon, the source of the Jordan,
PSA.42.6	from the land of Mount Mizar.
PSA.42.7	I hear the tumult of the raging seas
PSA.42.7	as your waves and surging tides sweep over me.
PSA.42.8	But each day the 
PSA.42.8	and through each night I sing his songs,
PSA.42.8	praying to God who gives me life.
PSA.42.9	“O God my rock,” I cry,
PSA.42.9	“Why have you forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why must I wander around in grief,
PSA.42.9	oppressed by my enemies?”
PSA.42.10	Their taunts break my bones.
PSA.42.10	They scoff, “Where is this God of yours?”
PSA.42.11	Why am I discouraged?
PSA.42.11	Why is my heart so sad?
PSA.42.11	I will put my hope in God!
PSA.42.11	I will praise him again—
PSA.42.11	my Savior and my God!
PSA.43.1	Declare me innocent, O God!
PSA.43.1	Defend me against these ungodly people.
PSA.43.1	Rescue me from these unjust liars.
PSA.43.2	For you are God, my only safe haven.
PSA.43.2	Why have you tossed me aside?
PSA.43.2	Why must I wander around in grief,
PSA.43.2	oppressed by my enemies?
PSA.43.3	Send out your light and your truth;
PSA.43.3	let them guide me.
PSA.43.3	Let them lead me to your holy mountain,
PSA.43.3	to the place where you live.
PSA.43.4	There I will go to the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	to God—the source of all my joy.
PSA.43.4	I will praise you with my harp,
PSA.43.4	O God, my God!
PSA.43.5	Why am I discouraged?
PSA.43.5	Why is my heart so sad?
PSA.43.5	I will put my hope in God!
PSA.43.5	I will praise him again—
PSA.43.5	my Savior and my God!
PSA.44.1	O God, we have heard it with our own ears—
PSA.44.1	our ancestors have told us
PSA.44.1	of all you did in their day,
PSA.44.1	in days long ago:
PSA.44.2	You drove out the pagan nations by your power
PSA.44.2	and gave all the land to our ancestors.
PSA.44.2	You crushed their enemies
PSA.44.2	and set our ancestors free.
PSA.44.3	They did not conquer the land with their swords;
PSA.44.3	it was not their own strong arm that gave them victory.
PSA.44.3	It was your right hand and strong arm
PSA.44.3	and the blinding light from your face that helped them,
PSA.44.3	for you loved them.
PSA.44.4	You are my King and my God.
PSA.44.4	You command victories for Israel.
PSA.44.5	Only by your power can we push back our enemies;
PSA.44.5	only in your name can we trample our foes.
PSA.44.6	I do not trust in my bow;
PSA.44.6	I do not count on my sword to save me.
PSA.44.7	You are the one who gives us victory over our enemies;
PSA.44.7	you disgrace those who hate us.
PSA.44.8	O God, we give glory to you all day long
PSA.44.8	and constantly praise your name.
PSA.44.8	Interlude
PSA.44.9	But now you have tossed us aside in dishonor.
PSA.44.9	You no longer lead our armies to battle.
PSA.44.10	You make us retreat from our enemies
PSA.44.10	and allow those who hate us to plunder our land.
PSA.44.11	You have butchered us like sheep
PSA.44.11	and scattered us among the nations.
PSA.44.12	You sold your precious people for a pittance,
PSA.44.12	making nothing on the sale.
PSA.44.13	You let our neighbors mock us.
PSA.44.13	We are an object of scorn and derision to those around us.
PSA.44.14	You have made us the butt of their jokes;
PSA.44.14	they shake their heads at us in scorn.
PSA.44.15	We can’t escape the constant humiliation;
PSA.44.15	shame is written across our faces.
PSA.44.16	All we hear are the taunts of our mockers.
PSA.44.16	All we see are our vengeful enemies.
PSA.44.17	All this has happened though we have not forgotten you.
PSA.44.17	We have not violated your covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our hearts have not deserted you.
PSA.44.18	We have not strayed from your path.
PSA.44.19	Yet you have crushed us in the jackal’s desert home.
PSA.44.19	You have covered us with darkness and death.
PSA.44.20	If we had forgotten the name of our God
PSA.44.20	or spread our hands in prayer to foreign gods,
PSA.44.21	God would surely have known it,
PSA.44.21	for he knows the secrets of every heart.
PSA.44.22	But for your sake we are killed every day;
PSA.44.22	we are being slaughtered like sheep.
PSA.44.23	Wake up, O Lord! Why do you sleep?
PSA.44.23	Get up! Do not reject us forever.
PSA.44.24	Why do you look the other way?
PSA.44.24	Why do you ignore our suffering and oppression?
PSA.44.25	We collapse in the dust,
PSA.44.25	lying face down in the dirt.
PSA.44.26	Rise up! Help us!
PSA.44.26	Ransom us because of your unfailing love.
PSA.45.1	Beautiful words stir my heart.
PSA.45.1	I will recite a lovely poem about the king,
PSA.45.1	for my tongue is like the pen of a skillful poet.
PSA.45.2	You are the most handsome of all.
PSA.45.2	Gracious words stream from your lips.
PSA.45.2	God himself has blessed you forever.
PSA.45.3	Put on your sword, O mighty warrior!
PSA.45.3	You are so glorious, so majestic!
PSA.45.4	In your majesty, ride out to victory,
PSA.45.4	defending truth, humility, and justice.
PSA.45.4	Go forth to perform awe-inspiring deeds!
PSA.45.5	Your arrows are sharp, piercing your enemies’ hearts.
PSA.45.5	The nations fall beneath your feet.
PSA.45.6	Your throne, O God,
PSA.45.6	You rule with a scepter of justice.
PSA.45.7	You love justice and hate evil.
PSA.45.7	Therefore God, your God, has anointed you,
PSA.45.7	pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.
PSA.45.8	Myrrh, aloes, and cassia perfume your robes.
PSA.45.8	In ivory palaces the music of strings entertains you.
PSA.45.9	Kings’ daughters are among your noble women.
PSA.45.9	At your right side stands the queen,
PSA.45.9	wearing jewelry of finest gold from Ophir!
PSA.45.10	Listen to me, O royal daughter; take to heart what I say.
PSA.45.10	Forget your people and your family far away.
PSA.45.11	For your royal husband delights in your beauty;
PSA.45.11	honor him, for he is your lord.
PSA.45.12	The princess of Tyre
PSA.45.12	The wealthy will beg your favor.
PSA.45.13	The bride, a princess, looks glorious
PSA.45.13	in her golden gown.
PSA.45.14	In her beautiful robes, she is led to the king,
PSA.45.14	accompanied by her bridesmaids.
PSA.45.15	What a joyful and enthusiastic procession
PSA.45.15	as they enter the king’s palace!
PSA.45.16	Your sons will become kings like their father.
PSA.45.16	You will make them rulers over many lands.
PSA.45.17	I will bring honor to your name in every generation.
PSA.45.17	Therefore, the nations will praise you forever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength,
PSA.46.1	always ready to help in times of trouble.
PSA.46.2	So we will not fear when earthquakes come
PSA.46.2	and the mountains crumble into the sea.
PSA.46.3	Let the oceans roar and foam.
PSA.46.3	Let the mountains tremble as the waters surge!
PSA.46.3	Interlude
PSA.46.4	A river brings joy to the city of our God,
PSA.46.4	the sacred home of the Most High.
PSA.46.5	God dwells in that city; it cannot be destroyed.
PSA.46.5	From the very break of day, God will protect it.
PSA.46.6	The nations are in chaos,
PSA.46.6	and their kingdoms crumble!
PSA.46.6	God’s voice thunders,
PSA.46.6	and the earth melts!

PSA.46.7	Interlude
PSA.46.8	Come, see the glorious works of the 
PSA.46.8	See how he brings destruction upon the world.
PSA.46.9	He causes wars to end throughout the earth.
PSA.46.9	He breaks the bow and snaps the spear;
PSA.46.9	he burns the shields with fire.
PSA.46.10	“Be still, and know that I am God!
PSA.46.10	I will be honored by every nation.
PSA.46.10	I will be honored throughout the world.”
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.46.11	the God of Israel is our fortress.
PSA.46.11	Interlude
PSA.47.1	Come, everyone! Clap your hands!
PSA.47.1	Shout to God with joyful praise!
PSA.47.2	For the 
PSA.47.2	He is the great King of all the earth.
PSA.47.3	He subdues the nations before us,
PSA.47.3	putting our enemies beneath our feet.
PSA.47.4	He chose the Promised Land as our inheritance,
PSA.47.4	the proud possession of Jacob’s descendants, whom he loves.
PSA.47.4	Interlude
PSA.47.5	God has ascended with a mighty shout.
PSA.47.5	The 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God, sing praises;
PSA.47.6	sing praises to our King, sing praises!
PSA.47.7	For God is the King over all the earth.
PSA.47.7	Praise him with a psalm.
PSA.47.8	God reigns above the nations,
PSA.47.8	sitting on his holy throne.
PSA.47.9	The rulers of the world have gathered together
PSA.47.9	with the people of the God of Abraham.
PSA.47.9	For all the kings of the earth belong to God.
PSA.47.9	He is highly honored everywhere.
PSA.48.1	How great is the 
PSA.48.1	how deserving of praise,
PSA.48.1	in the city of our God,
PSA.48.1	which sits on his holy mountain!
PSA.48.2	It is high and magnificent;
PSA.48.2	the whole earth rejoices to see it!
PSA.48.2	Mount Zion, the holy mountain,
PSA.48.2	is the city of the great King!
PSA.48.3	God himself is in Jerusalem’s towers,
PSA.48.3	revealing himself as its defender.
PSA.48.4	The kings of the earth joined forces
PSA.48.4	and advanced against the city.
PSA.48.5	But when they saw it, they were stunned;
PSA.48.5	they were terrified and ran away.
PSA.48.6	They were gripped with terror
PSA.48.6	and writhed in pain like a woman in labor.
PSA.48.7	You destroyed them like the mighty ships of Tarshish
PSA.48.7	shattered by a powerful east wind.
PSA.48.8	We had heard of the city’s glory,
PSA.48.8	but now we have seen it ourselves—
PSA.48.8	the city of the 
PSA.48.8	It is the city of our God;
PSA.48.8	he will make it safe forever.
PSA.48.8	Interlude
PSA.48.9	O God, we meditate on your unfailing love
PSA.48.9	as we worship in your Temple.
PSA.48.10	As your name deserves, O God,
PSA.48.10	you will be praised to the ends of the earth.
PSA.48.10	Your strong right hand is filled with victory.
PSA.48.11	Let the people on Mount Zion rejoice.
PSA.48.11	Let all the towns of Judah be glad
PSA.48.11	because of your justice.
PSA.48.12	Go, inspect the city of Jerusalem.
PSA.48.12	Walk around and count the many towers.
PSA.48.13	Take note of the fortified walls,
PSA.48.13	and tour all the citadels,
PSA.48.13	that you may describe them
PSA.48.13	to future generations.
PSA.48.14	For that is what God is like.
PSA.48.14	He is our God forever and ever,
PSA.48.14	and he will guide us until we die.
PSA.49.1	Listen to this, all you people!
PSA.49.1	Pay attention, everyone in the world!
PSA.49.2	High and low,
PSA.49.2	rich and poor—listen!
PSA.49.3	For my words are wise,
PSA.49.3	and my thoughts are filled with insight.
PSA.49.4	I listen carefully to many proverbs
PSA.49.4	and solve riddles with inspiration from a harp.
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear when trouble comes,
PSA.49.5	when enemies surround me?
PSA.49.6	They trust in their wealth
PSA.49.6	and boast of great riches.
PSA.49.7	Yet they cannot redeem themselves from death
PSA.49.7	by paying a ransom to God.
PSA.49.8	Redemption does not come so easily,
PSA.49.8	for no one can ever pay enough
PSA.49.9	to live forever
PSA.49.9	and never see the grave.
PSA.49.10	Those who are wise must finally die,
PSA.49.10	just like the foolish and senseless,
PSA.49.10	leaving all their wealth behind.
PSA.49.11	The grave
PSA.49.11	where they will stay forever.
PSA.49.11	They may name their estates after themselves,
PSA.49.12	but their fame will not last.
PSA.49.12	They will die, just like animals.
PSA.49.13	This is the fate of fools,
PSA.49.13	though they are remembered as being wise.
PSA.49.13	Interlude
PSA.49.14	Like sheep, they are led to the grave,
PSA.49.14	where death will be their shepherd.
PSA.49.14	In the morning the godly will rule over them.
PSA.49.14	Their bodies will rot in the grave,
PSA.49.14	far from their grand estates.
PSA.49.15	But as for me, God will redeem my life.
PSA.49.15	He will snatch me from the power of the grave.
PSA.49.15	Interlude
PSA.49.16	So don’t be dismayed when the wicked grow rich
PSA.49.16	and their homes become ever more splendid.
PSA.49.17	For when they die, they take nothing with them.
PSA.49.17	Their wealth will not follow them into the grave.
PSA.49.18	In this life they consider themselves fortunate
PSA.49.18	and are applauded for their success.
PSA.49.19	But they will die like all before them
PSA.49.19	and never again see the light of day.
PSA.49.20	People who boast of their wealth don’t understand;
PSA.49.20	they will die, just like animals.
PSA.50.1	The 
PSA.50.1	and he has spoken;
PSA.50.1	he has summoned all humanity
PSA.50.1	from where the sun rises to where it sets.
PSA.50.2	From Mount Zion, the perfection of beauty,
PSA.50.2	God shines in glorious radiance.
PSA.50.3	Our God approaches,
PSA.50.3	and he is not silent.
PSA.50.3	Fire devours everything in his way,
PSA.50.3	and a great storm rages around him.
PSA.50.4	He calls on the heavens above and earth below
PSA.50.4	to witness the judgment of his people.
PSA.50.5	“Bring my faithful people to me—
PSA.50.5	those who made a covenant with me by giving sacrifices.”
PSA.50.6	Then let the heavens proclaim his justice,
PSA.50.6	for God himself will be the judge.
PSA.50.6	Interlude
PSA.50.7	“O my people, listen as I speak.
PSA.50.7	Here are my charges against you, O Israel:
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God!
PSA.50.8	I have no complaint about your sacrifices
PSA.50.8	or the burnt offerings you constantly offer.
PSA.50.9	But I do not need the bulls from your barns
PSA.50.9	or the goats from your pens.
PSA.50.10	For all the animals of the forest are mine,
PSA.50.10	and I own the cattle on a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know every bird on the mountains,
PSA.50.11	and all the animals of the field are mine.
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
PSA.50.12	for all the world is mine and everything in it.
PSA.50.13	Do I eat the meat of bulls?
PSA.50.13	Do I drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	Make thankfulness your sacrifice to God,
PSA.50.14	and keep the vows you made to the Most High.
PSA.50.15	Then call on me when you are in trouble,
PSA.50.15	and I will rescue you,
PSA.50.15	and you will give me glory.”
PSA.50.16	But God says to the wicked:
PSA.50.16	“Why bother reciting my decrees
PSA.50.16	and pretending to obey my covenant?
PSA.50.17	For you refuse my discipline
PSA.50.17	and treat my words like trash.
PSA.50.18	When you see thieves, you approve of them,
PSA.50.18	and you spend your time with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	Your mouth is filled with wickedness,
PSA.50.19	and your tongue is full of lies.
PSA.50.20	You sit around and slander your brother—
PSA.50.20	your own mother’s son.
PSA.50.21	While you did all this, I remained silent,
PSA.50.21	and you thought I didn’t care.
PSA.50.21	But now I will rebuke you,
PSA.50.21	listing all my charges against you.
PSA.50.22	Repent, all of you who forget me,
PSA.50.22	or I will tear you apart,
PSA.50.22	and no one will help you.
PSA.50.23	But giving thanks is a sacrifice that truly honors me.
PSA.50.23	If you keep to my path,
PSA.50.23	I will reveal to you the salvation of God.”
PSA.51.1	Have mercy on me, O God,
PSA.51.1	because of your unfailing love.
PSA.51.1	Because of your great compassion,
PSA.51.1	blot out the stain of my sins.
PSA.51.2	Wash me clean from my guilt.
PSA.51.2	Purify me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I recognize my rebellion;
PSA.51.3	it haunts me day and night.
PSA.51.4	Against you, and you alone, have I sinned;
PSA.51.4	I have done what is evil in your sight.
PSA.51.4	You will be proved right in what you say,
PSA.51.4	and your judgment against me is just.
PSA.51.5	For I was born a sinner—
PSA.51.5	yes, from the moment my mother conceived me.
PSA.51.6	But you desire honesty from the womb,
PSA.51.6	teaching me wisdom even there.
PSA.51.7	Purify me from my sins,
PSA.51.7	wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Oh, give me back my joy again;
PSA.51.8	you have broken me—
PSA.51.8	now let me rejoice.
PSA.51.9	Don’t keep looking at my sins.
PSA.51.9	Remove the stain of my guilt.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a clean heart, O God.
PSA.51.10	Renew a loyal spirit within me.
PSA.51.11	Do not banish me from your presence,
PSA.51.11	and don’t take your Holy Spirit
PSA.51.12	Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
PSA.51.12	and make me willing to obey you.
PSA.51.13	Then I will teach your ways to rebels,
PSA.51.13	and they will return to you.
PSA.51.14	Forgive me for shedding blood, O God who saves;
PSA.51.14	then I will joyfully sing of your forgiveness.
PSA.51.15	Unseal my lips, O Lord,
PSA.51.15	that my mouth may praise you.
PSA.51.16	You do not desire a sacrifice, or I would offer one.
PSA.51.16	You do not want a burnt offering.
PSA.51.17	The sacrifice you desire is a broken spirit.
PSA.51.17	You will not reject a broken and repentant heart, O God.
PSA.51.18	Look with favor on Zion and help her;
PSA.51.18	rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then you will be pleased with sacrifices offered in the right spirit—
PSA.51.19	with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings.
PSA.51.19	Then bulls will again be sacrificed on your altar.
PSA.52.1	Why do you boast about your crimes, great warrior?
PSA.52.1	Don’t you realize God’s justice continues forever?
PSA.52.2	All day long you plot destruction.
PSA.52.2	Your tongue cuts like a sharp razor;
PSA.52.2	you’re an expert at telling lies.
PSA.52.3	You love evil more than good
PSA.52.3	and lies more than truth.
PSA.52.3	Interlude
PSA.52.4	You love to destroy others with your words,
PSA.52.4	you liar!
PSA.52.5	But God will strike you down once and for all.
PSA.52.5	He will pull you from your home
PSA.52.5	and uproot you from the land of the living.
PSA.52.5	Interlude
PSA.52.6	The righteous will see it and be amazed.
PSA.52.6	They will laugh and say,
PSA.52.7	“Look what happens to mighty warriors
PSA.52.7	who do not trust in God.
PSA.52.7	They trust their wealth instead
PSA.52.7	and grow more and more bold in their wickedness.”
PSA.52.8	But I am like an olive tree, thriving in the house of God.
PSA.52.8	I will always trust in God’s unfailing love.
PSA.52.9	I will praise you forever, O God,
PSA.52.9	for what you have done.
PSA.52.9	I will trust in your good name
PSA.52.9	in the presence of your faithful people.
PSA.53.1	Only fools say in their hearts,
PSA.53.1	“There is no God.”
PSA.53.1	They are corrupt, and their actions are evil;
PSA.53.1	not one of them does good!
PSA.53.2	God looks down from heaven
PSA.53.2	on the entire human race;
PSA.53.2	he looks to see if anyone is truly wise,
PSA.53.2	if anyone seeks God.
PSA.53.3	But no, all have turned away;
PSA.53.3	all have become corrupt.
PSA.53.3	No one does good,
PSA.53.3	not a single one!
PSA.53.4	Will those who do evil never learn?
PSA.53.4	They eat up my people like bread
PSA.53.4	and wouldn’t think of praying to God.
PSA.53.5	Terror will grip them,
PSA.53.5	terror like they have never known before.
PSA.53.5	God will scatter the bones of your enemies.
PSA.53.5	You will put them to shame, for God has rejected them.
PSA.53.6	Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel?
PSA.53.6	When God restores his people,
PSA.53.6	Jacob will shout with joy, and Israel will rejoice.
PSA.54.1	Come with great power, O God, and rescue me!
PSA.54.1	Defend me with your might.
PSA.54.2	Listen to my prayer, O God.
PSA.54.2	Pay attention to my plea.
PSA.54.3	For strangers are attacking me;
PSA.54.3	violent people are trying to kill me.
PSA.54.3	They care nothing for God.
PSA.54.3	Interlude
PSA.54.4	But God is my helper.
PSA.54.4	The Lord keeps me alive!
PSA.54.5	May the evil plans of my enemies be turned against them.
PSA.54.5	Do as you promised and put an end to them.
PSA.54.6	I will sacrifice a voluntary offering to you;
PSA.54.6	I will praise your name, O 
PSA.54.6	for it is good.
PSA.54.7	For you have rescued me from my troubles
PSA.54.7	and helped me to triumph over my enemies.
PSA.55.1	Listen to my prayer, O God.
PSA.55.1	Do not ignore my cry for help!
PSA.55.2	Please listen and answer me,
PSA.55.2	for I am overwhelmed by my troubles.
PSA.55.3	My enemies shout at me,
PSA.55.3	making loud and wicked threats.
PSA.55.3	They bring trouble on me
PSA.55.3	and angrily hunt me down.
PSA.55.4	My heart pounds in my chest.
PSA.55.4	The terror of death assaults me.
PSA.55.5	Fear and trembling overwhelm me,
PSA.55.5	and I can’t stop shaking.
PSA.55.6	Oh, that I had wings like a dove;
PSA.55.6	then I would fly away and rest!
PSA.55.7	I would fly far away
PSA.55.7	to the quiet of the wilderness.
PSA.55.7	Interlude
PSA.55.8	How quickly I would escape—
PSA.55.8	far from this wild storm of hatred.
PSA.55.9	Confuse them, Lord, and frustrate their plans,
PSA.55.9	for I see violence and conflict in the city.
PSA.55.10	Its walls are patrolled day and night against invaders,
PSA.55.10	but the real danger is wickedness within the city.
PSA.55.11	Everything is falling apart;
PSA.55.11	threats and cheating are rampant in the streets.
PSA.55.12	It is not an enemy who taunts me—
PSA.55.12	I could bear that.
PSA.55.12	It is not my foes who so arrogantly insult me—
PSA.55.12	I could have hidden from them.
PSA.55.13	Instead, it is you—my equal,
PSA.55.13	my companion and close friend.
PSA.55.14	What good fellowship we once enjoyed
PSA.55.14	as we walked together to the house of God.
PSA.55.15	Let death stalk my enemies;
PSA.55.15	let the grave
PSA.55.15	for evil makes its home within them.
PSA.55.16	But I will call on God,
PSA.55.16	and the 
PSA.55.17	Morning, noon, and night
PSA.55.17	I cry out in my distress,
PSA.55.17	and the 
PSA.55.18	He ransoms me and keeps me safe
PSA.55.18	from the battle waged against me,
PSA.55.18	though many still oppose me.
PSA.55.19	God, who has ruled forever,
PSA.55.19	will hear me and humble them.
PSA.55.19	Interlude
PSA.55.19	For my enemies refuse to change their ways;
PSA.55.19	they do not fear God.
PSA.55.20	As for my companion, he betrayed his friends;
PSA.55.20	he broke his promises.
PSA.55.21	His words are as smooth as butter,
PSA.55.21	but in his heart is war.
PSA.55.21	His words are as soothing as lotion,
PSA.55.21	but underneath are daggers!
PSA.55.22	Give your burdens to the 
PSA.55.22	and he will take care of you.
PSA.55.22	He will not permit the godly to slip and fall.
PSA.55.23	But you, O God, will send the wicked
PSA.55.23	down to the pit of destruction.
PSA.55.23	Murderers and liars will die young,
PSA.55.23	but I am trusting you to save me.
PSA.56.1	O God, have mercy on me,
PSA.56.1	for people are hounding me.
PSA.56.1	My foes attack me all day long.
PSA.56.2	I am constantly hounded by those who slander me,
PSA.56.2	and many are boldly attacking me.
PSA.56.3	But when I am afraid,
PSA.56.3	I will put my trust in you.
PSA.56.4	I praise God for what he has promised.
PSA.56.4	I trust in God, so why should I be afraid?
PSA.56.4	What can mere mortals do to me?
PSA.56.5	They are always twisting what I say;
PSA.56.5	they spend their days plotting to harm me.
PSA.56.6	They come together to spy on me—
PSA.56.6	watching my every step, eager to kill me.
PSA.56.7	Don’t let them get away with their wickedness;
PSA.56.7	in your anger, O God, bring them down.
PSA.56.8	You keep track of all my sorrows.
PSA.56.8	You have collected all my tears in your bottle.
PSA.56.8	You have recorded each one in your book.
PSA.56.9	My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help.
PSA.56.9	This I know: God is on my side!
PSA.56.10	I praise God for what he has promised;
PSA.56.10	yes, I praise the 
PSA.56.11	I trust in God, so why should I be afraid?
PSA.56.11	What can mere mortals do to me?
PSA.56.12	I will fulfill my vows to you, O God,
PSA.56.12	and will offer a sacrifice of thanks for your help.
PSA.56.13	For you have rescued me from death;
PSA.56.13	you have kept my feet from slipping.
PSA.56.13	So now I can walk in your presence, O God,
PSA.56.13	in your life-giving light.
PSA.57.1	Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy!
PSA.57.1	I look to you for protection.
PSA.57.1	I will hide beneath the shadow of your wings
PSA.57.1	until the danger passes by.
PSA.57.2	I cry out to God Most High,
PSA.57.2	to God who will fulfill his purpose for me.
PSA.57.3	He will send help from heaven to rescue me,
PSA.57.3	disgracing those who hound me.
PSA.57.3	Interlude
PSA.57.3	My God will send forth his unfailing love and faithfulness.
PSA.57.4	I am surrounded by fierce lions
PSA.57.4	who greedily devour human prey—
PSA.57.4	whose teeth pierce like spears and arrows,
PSA.57.4	and whose tongues cut like swords.
PSA.57.5	Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens!
PSA.57.5	May your glory shine over all the earth.
PSA.57.6	My enemies have set a trap for me.
PSA.57.6	I am weary from distress.
PSA.57.6	They have dug a deep pit in my path,
PSA.57.6	but they themselves have fallen into it.
PSA.57.6	Interlude
PSA.57.7	My heart is confident in you, O God;
PSA.57.7	my heart is confident.
PSA.57.7	No wonder I can sing your praises!
PSA.57.8	Wake up, my heart!
PSA.57.8	Wake up, O lyre and harp!
PSA.57.8	I will wake the dawn with my song.
PSA.57.9	I will thank you, Lord, among all the people.
PSA.57.9	I will sing your praises among the nations.
PSA.57.10	For your unfailing love is as high as the heavens.
PSA.57.10	Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
PSA.57.11	Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens.
PSA.57.11	May your glory shine over all the earth.
PSA.58.1	Justice—do you rulers
PSA.58.1	Do you judge the people fairly?
PSA.58.2	No! You plot injustice in your hearts.
PSA.58.2	You spread violence throughout the land.
PSA.58.3	These wicked people are born sinners;
PSA.58.3	even from birth they have lied and gone their own way.
PSA.58.4	They spit venom like deadly snakes;
PSA.58.4	they are like cobras that refuse to listen,
PSA.58.5	ignoring the tunes of the snake charmers,
PSA.58.5	no matter how skillfully they play.
PSA.58.6	Break off their fangs, O God!
PSA.58.6	Smash the jaws of these lions, O 
PSA.58.7	May they disappear like water into thirsty ground.
PSA.58.7	Make their weapons useless in their hands.
PSA.58.8	May they be like snails that dissolve into slime,
PSA.58.8	like a stillborn child who will never see the sun.
PSA.58.9	God will sweep them away, both young and old,
PSA.58.9	faster than a pot heats over burning thorns.
PSA.58.10	The godly will rejoice when they see injustice avenged.
PSA.58.10	They will wash their feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	Then at last everyone will say,
PSA.58.11	“There truly is a reward for those who live for God;
PSA.58.11	surely there is a God who judges justly here on earth.”
PSA.59.1	Rescue me from my enemies, O God.
PSA.59.1	Protect me from those who have come to destroy me.
PSA.59.2	Rescue me from these criminals;
PSA.59.2	save me from these murderers.
PSA.59.3	They have set an ambush for me.
PSA.59.3	Fierce enemies are out there waiting, 
PSA.59.3	though I have not sinned or offended them.
PSA.59.4	I have done nothing wrong,
PSA.59.4	yet they prepare to attack me.
PSA.59.4	Wake up! See what is happening and help me!
PSA.59.5	O 
PSA.59.5	wake up and punish those hostile nations.
PSA.59.5	Show no mercy to wicked traitors.
PSA.59.5	Interlude
PSA.59.6	They come out at night,
PSA.59.6	snarling like vicious dogs
PSA.59.6	as they prowl the streets.
PSA.59.7	Listen to the filth that comes from their mouths;
PSA.59.7	their words cut like swords.
PSA.59.7	“After all, who can hear us?” they sneer.
PSA.59.8	But 
PSA.59.8	You scoff at all the hostile nations.
PSA.59.9	You are my strength; I wait for you to rescue me,
PSA.59.9	for you, O God, are my fortress.
PSA.59.10	In his unfailing love, my God will stand with me.
PSA.59.10	He will let me look down in triumph on all my enemies.
PSA.59.11	Don’t kill them, for my people soon forget such lessons;
PSA.59.11	stagger them with your power, and bring them to their knees,
PSA.59.11	O Lord our shield.
PSA.59.12	Because of the sinful things they say,
PSA.59.12	because of the evil that is on their lips,
PSA.59.12	let them be captured by their pride,
PSA.59.12	their curses, and their lies.
PSA.59.13	Destroy them in your anger!
PSA.59.13	Wipe them out completely!
PSA.59.13	Then the whole world will know
PSA.59.13	that God reigns in Israel.
PSA.59.13	Interlude
PSA.59.14	My enemies come out at night,
PSA.59.14	snarling like vicious dogs
PSA.59.14	as they prowl the streets.
PSA.59.15	They scavenge for food
PSA.59.15	but go to sleep unsatisfied.
PSA.59.16	But as for me, I will sing about your power.
PSA.59.16	Each morning I will sing with joy about your unfailing love.
PSA.59.16	For you have been my refuge,
PSA.59.16	a place of safety when I am in distress.
PSA.59.17	O my Strength, to you I sing praises,
PSA.59.17	for you, O God, are my refuge,
PSA.59.17	the God who shows me unfailing love.
PSA.60.1	You have rejected us, O God, and broken our defenses.
PSA.60.1	You have been angry with us; now restore us to your favor.
PSA.60.2	You have shaken our land and split it open.
PSA.60.2	Seal the cracks, for the land trembles.
PSA.60.3	You have been very hard on us,
PSA.60.3	making us drink wine that sent us reeling.
PSA.60.4	But you have raised a banner for those who fear you—
PSA.60.4	a rallying point in the face of attack.
PSA.60.4	Interlude
PSA.60.5	Now rescue your beloved people.
PSA.60.5	Answer and save us by your power.
PSA.60.6	God has promised this by his holiness
PSA.60.6	“I will divide up Shechem with joy.
PSA.60.6	I will measure out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	Gilead is mine,
PSA.60.7	and Manasseh, too.
PSA.60.7	Ephraim, my helmet, will produce my warriors,
PSA.60.7	and Judah, my scepter, will produce my kings.
PSA.60.8	But Moab, my washbasin, will become my servant,
PSA.60.8	and I will wipe my feet on Edom
PSA.60.8	and shout in triumph over Philistia.”
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me into the fortified city?
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me victory over Edom?
PSA.60.10	Have you rejected us, O God?
PSA.60.10	Will you no longer march with our armies?
PSA.60.11	Oh, please help us against our enemies,
PSA.60.11	for all human help is useless.
PSA.60.12	With God’s help we will do mighty things,
PSA.60.12	for he will trample down our foes.
PSA.61.1	O God, listen to my cry!
PSA.61.1	Hear my prayer!
PSA.61.2	From the ends of the earth,
PSA.61.2	I cry to you for help
PSA.61.2	when my heart is overwhelmed.
PSA.61.2	Lead me to the towering rock of safety,
PSA.61.3	for you are my safe refuge,
PSA.61.3	a fortress where my enemies cannot reach me.
PSA.61.4	Let me live forever in your sanctuary,
PSA.61.4	safe beneath the shelter of your wings!
PSA.61.4	Interlude
PSA.61.5	For you have heard my vows, O God.
PSA.61.5	You have given me an inheritance reserved for those who fear your name.
PSA.61.6	Add many years to the life of the king!
PSA.61.6	May his years span the generations!
PSA.61.7	May he reign under God’s protection forever.
PSA.61.7	May your unfailing love and faithfulness watch over him.
PSA.61.8	Then I will sing praises to your name forever
PSA.61.8	as I fulfill my vows each day.
PSA.62.1	I wait quietly before God,
PSA.62.1	for my victory comes from him.
PSA.62.2	He alone is my rock and my salvation,
PSA.62.2	my fortress where I will never be shaken.
PSA.62.3	So many enemies against one man—
PSA.62.3	all of them trying to kill me.
PSA.62.3	To them I’m just a broken-down wall
PSA.62.3	or a tottering fence.
PSA.62.4	They plan to topple me from my high position.
PSA.62.4	They delight in telling lies about me.
PSA.62.4	They praise me to my face
PSA.62.4	but curse me in their hearts.
PSA.62.4	Interlude
PSA.62.5	Let all that I am wait quietly before God,
PSA.62.5	for my hope is in him.
PSA.62.6	He alone is my rock and my salvation,
PSA.62.6	my fortress where I will not be shaken.
PSA.62.7	My victory and honor come from God alone.
PSA.62.7	He is my refuge, a rock where no enemy can reach me.
PSA.62.8	O my people, trust in him at all times.
PSA.62.8	Pour out your heart to him,
PSA.62.8	for God is our refuge.
PSA.62.8	Interlude
PSA.62.9	Common people are as worthless as a puff of wind,
PSA.62.9	and the powerful are not what they appear to be.
PSA.62.9	If you weigh them on the scales,
PSA.62.9	together they are lighter than a breath of air.
PSA.62.10	Don’t make your living by extortion
PSA.62.10	or put your hope in stealing.
PSA.62.10	And if your wealth increases,
PSA.62.10	don’t make it the center of your life.
PSA.62.11	God has spoken plainly,
PSA.62.11	and I have heard it many times:
PSA.62.11	Power, O God, belongs to you;
PSA.62.12	unfailing love, O Lord, is yours.
PSA.62.12	Surely you repay all people
PSA.62.12	according to what they have done.
PSA.63.1	O God, you are my God;
PSA.63.1	I earnestly search for you.
PSA.63.1	My soul thirsts for you;
PSA.63.1	my whole body longs for you
PSA.63.1	in this parched and weary land
PSA.63.1	where there is no water.
PSA.63.2	I have seen you in your sanctuary
PSA.63.2	and gazed upon your power and glory.
PSA.63.3	Your unfailing love is better than life itself;
PSA.63.3	how I praise you!
PSA.63.4	I will praise you as long as I live,
PSA.63.4	lifting up my hands to you in prayer.
PSA.63.5	You satisfy me more than the richest feast.
PSA.63.5	I will praise you with songs of joy.
PSA.63.6	I lie awake thinking of you,
PSA.63.6	meditating on you through the night.
PSA.63.7	Because you are my helper,
PSA.63.7	I sing for joy in the shadow of your wings.
PSA.63.8	I cling to you;
PSA.63.8	your strong right hand holds me securely.
PSA.63.9	But those plotting to destroy me will come to ruin.
PSA.63.9	They will go down into the depths of the earth.
PSA.63.10	They will die by the sword
PSA.63.10	and become the food of jackals.
PSA.63.11	But the king will rejoice in God.
PSA.63.11	All who swear to tell the truth will praise him,
PSA.63.11	while liars will be silenced.
PSA.64.1	O God, listen to my complaint.
PSA.64.1	Protect my life from my enemies’ threats.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the plots of this evil mob,
PSA.64.2	from this gang of wrongdoers.
PSA.64.3	They sharpen their tongues like swords
PSA.64.3	and aim their bitter words like arrows.
PSA.64.4	They shoot from ambush at the innocent,
PSA.64.4	attacking suddenly and fearlessly.
PSA.64.5	They encourage each other to do evil
PSA.64.5	and plan how to set their traps in secret.
PSA.64.5	“Who will ever notice?” they ask.
PSA.64.6	As they plot their crimes, they say,
PSA.64.6	“We have devised the perfect plan!”
PSA.64.6	Yes, the human heart and mind are cunning.
PSA.64.7	But God himself will shoot them with his arrows,
PSA.64.7	suddenly striking them down.
PSA.64.8	Their own tongues will ruin them,
PSA.64.8	and all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.
PSA.64.9	Then everyone will be afraid;
PSA.64.9	they will proclaim the mighty acts of God
PSA.64.9	and realize all the amazing things he does.
PSA.64.10	The godly will rejoice in the 
PSA.64.10	and find shelter in him.
PSA.64.10	And those who do what is right
PSA.64.10	will praise him.
PSA.65.1	What mighty praise, O God,
PSA.65.1	belongs to you in Zion.
PSA.65.1	We will fulfill our vows to you,
PSA.65.2	for you answer our prayers.
PSA.65.2	All of us must come to you.
PSA.65.3	Though we are overwhelmed by our sins,
PSA.65.3	you forgive them all.
PSA.65.4	What joy for those you choose to bring near,
PSA.65.4	those who live in your holy courts.
PSA.65.4	What festivities await us
PSA.65.4	inside your holy Temple.
PSA.65.5	You faithfully answer our prayers with awesome deeds,
PSA.65.5	O God our savior.
PSA.65.5	You are the hope of everyone on earth,
PSA.65.5	even those who sail on distant seas.
PSA.65.6	You formed the mountains by your power
PSA.65.6	and armed yourself with mighty strength.
PSA.65.7	You quieted the raging oceans
PSA.65.7	with their pounding waves
PSA.65.7	and silenced the shouting of the nations.
PSA.65.8	Those who live at the ends of the earth
PSA.65.8	stand in awe of your wonders.
PSA.65.8	From where the sun rises to where it sets,
PSA.65.8	you inspire shouts of joy.
PSA.65.9	You take care of the earth and water it,
PSA.65.9	making it rich and fertile.
PSA.65.9	The river of God has plenty of water;
PSA.65.9	it provides a bountiful harvest of grain,
PSA.65.9	for you have ordered it so.
PSA.65.10	You drench the plowed ground with rain,
PSA.65.10	melting the clods and leveling the ridges.
PSA.65.10	You soften the earth with showers
PSA.65.10	and bless its abundant crops.
PSA.65.11	You crown the year with a bountiful harvest;
PSA.65.11	even the hard pathways overflow with abundance.
PSA.65.12	The grasslands of the wilderness become a lush pasture,
PSA.65.12	and the hillsides blossom with joy.
PSA.65.13	The meadows are clothed with flocks of sheep,
PSA.65.13	and the valleys are carpeted with grain.
PSA.65.13	They all shout and sing for joy!
PSA.66.1	Shout joyful praises to God, all the earth!
PSA.66.2	Sing about the glory of his name!
PSA.66.2	Tell the world how glorious he is.
PSA.66.3	Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds!
PSA.66.3	Your enemies cringe before your mighty power.
PSA.66.4	Everything on earth will worship you;
PSA.66.4	they will sing your praises,
PSA.66.4	shouting your name in glorious songs.”
PSA.66.4	Interlude
PSA.66.5	Come and see what our God has done,
PSA.66.5	what awesome miracles he performs for people!
PSA.66.6	He made a dry path through the Red Sea,
PSA.66.6	and his people went across on foot.
PSA.66.6	There we rejoiced in him.
PSA.66.7	For by his great power he rules forever.
PSA.66.7	He watches every movement of the nations;
PSA.66.7	let no rebel rise in defiance.
PSA.66.7	Interlude
PSA.66.8	Let the whole world bless our God
PSA.66.8	and loudly sing his praises.
PSA.66.9	Our lives are in his hands,
PSA.66.9	and he keeps our feet from stumbling.
PSA.66.10	You have tested us, O God;
PSA.66.10	you have purified us like silver.
PSA.66.11	You captured us in your net
PSA.66.11	and laid the burden of slavery on our backs.
PSA.66.12	Then you put a leader over us.
PSA.66.12	We went through fire and flood,
PSA.66.12	but you brought us to a place of great abundance.
PSA.66.13	Now I come to your Temple with burnt offerings
PSA.66.13	to fulfill the vows I made to you—
PSA.66.14	yes, the sacred vows that I made
PSA.66.14	when I was in deep trouble.
PSA.66.15	That is why I am sacrificing burnt offerings to you—
PSA.66.15	the best of my rams as a pleasing aroma,
PSA.66.15	and a sacrifice of bulls and male goats.
PSA.66.15	Interlude
PSA.66.16	Come and listen, all you who fear God,
PSA.66.16	and I will tell you what he did for me.
PSA.66.17	For I cried out to him for help,
PSA.66.17	praising him as I spoke.
PSA.66.18	If I had not confessed the sin in my heart,
PSA.66.18	the Lord would not have listened.
PSA.66.19	But God did listen!
PSA.66.19	He paid attention to my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Praise God, who did not ignore my prayer
PSA.66.20	or withdraw his unfailing love from me.
PSA.67.1	May God be merciful and bless us.
PSA.67.1	May his face smile with favor on us.
PSA.67.1	Interlude
PSA.67.2	May your ways be known throughout the earth,
PSA.67.2	your saving power among people everywhere.
PSA.67.3	May the nations praise you, O God.
PSA.67.3	Yes, may all the nations praise you.

PSA.67.4	and guide the people of the whole world.
PSA.67.4	Interlude
PSA.67.5	May the nations praise you, O God.
PSA.67.5	Yes, may all the nations praise you.
PSA.67.6	Then the earth will yield its harvests,
PSA.67.6	and God, our God, will richly bless us.
PSA.67.7	Yes, God will bless us,
PSA.67.7	and people all over the world will fear him.
PSA.68.1	Rise up, O God, and scatter your enemies.
PSA.68.1	Let those who hate God run for their lives.
PSA.68.2	Blow them away like smoke.
PSA.68.2	Melt them like wax in a fire.
PSA.68.2	Let the wicked perish in the presence of God.
PSA.68.3	But let the godly rejoice.
PSA.68.3	Let them be glad in God’s presence.
PSA.68.3	Let them be filled with joy.
PSA.68.4	Sing praises to God and to his name!
PSA.68.4	Sing loud praises to him who rides the clouds.
PSA.68.4	His name is the 
PSA.68.4	rejoice in his presence!
PSA.68.5	Father to the fatherless, defender of widows—
PSA.68.5	this is God, whose dwelling is holy.
PSA.68.6	God places the lonely in families;
PSA.68.6	he sets the prisoners free and gives them joy.
PSA.68.6	But he makes the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.
PSA.68.7	O God, when you led your people out from Egypt,
PSA.68.7	when you marched through the dry wasteland,
PSA.68.7	Interlude
PSA.68.8	the earth trembled, and the heavens poured down rain
PSA.68.8	before you, the God of Sinai,
PSA.68.8	before God, the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	You sent abundant rain, O God,
PSA.68.9	to refresh the weary land.
PSA.68.10	There your people finally settled,
PSA.68.10	and with a bountiful harvest, O God,
PSA.68.10	you provided for your needy people.

PSA.68.11	and a great army
PSA.68.12	Enemy kings and their armies flee,
PSA.68.12	while the women of Israel divide the plunder.
PSA.68.13	Even those who lived among the sheepfolds found treasures—
PSA.68.13	doves with wings of silver
PSA.68.13	and feathers of gold.
PSA.68.14	The Almighty scattered the enemy kings
PSA.68.14	like a blowing snowstorm on Mount Zalmon.
PSA.68.15	The mountains of Bashan are majestic,
PSA.68.15	with many peaks stretching high into the sky.
PSA.68.16	Why do you look with envy, O rugged mountains,
PSA.68.16	at Mount Zion, where God has chosen to live,
PSA.68.16	where the 
PSA.68.17	Surrounded by unnumbered thousands of chariots,
PSA.68.17	the Lord came from Mount Sinai into his sanctuary.
PSA.68.18	When you ascended to the heights,
PSA.68.18	you led a crowd of captives.
PSA.68.18	You received gifts from the people,
PSA.68.18	even from those who rebelled against you.

PSA.68.22	The Lord says, “I will bring my enemies down from Bashan;
PSA.68.22	I will bring them up from the depths of the sea.
PSA.68.23	You, my people, will wash
PSA.68.23	and even your dogs will get their share!”
PSA.68.24	Your procession has come into view, O God—
PSA.68.24	the procession of my God and King as he goes into the sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	Singers are in front, musicians behind;
PSA.68.25	between them are young women playing tambourines.
PSA.68.26	Praise God, all you people of Israel;
PSA.68.26	praise the 
PSA.68.27	Look, the little tribe of Benjamin leads the way.
PSA.68.27	Then comes a great throng of rulers from Judah
PSA.68.27	and all the rulers of Zebulun and Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Summon your might, O God.
PSA.68.28	Display your power, O God, as you have in the past.
PSA.68.29	The kings of the earth are bringing tribute
PSA.68.29	to your Temple in Jerusalem.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke these enemy nations—
PSA.68.30	these wild animals lurking in the reeds,
PSA.68.30	this herd of bulls among the weaker calves.
PSA.68.30	Make them bring bars of silver in humble tribute.
PSA.68.30	Scatter the nations that delight in war.
PSA.68.31	Let Egypt come with gifts of precious metals
PSA.68.31	let Ethiopia
PSA.68.32	Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth.
PSA.68.32	Sing praises to the Lord.
PSA.68.32	Interlude
PSA.68.33	Sing to the one who rides across the ancient heavens,
PSA.68.33	his mighty voice thundering from the sky.
PSA.68.34	Tell everyone about God’s power.
PSA.68.34	His majesty shines down on Israel;
PSA.68.34	his strength is mighty in the heavens.
PSA.68.35	God is awesome in his sanctuary.
PSA.68.35	The God of Israel gives power and strength to his people.
PSA.68.35	Praise be to God!
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God,
PSA.69.1	for the floodwaters are up to my neck.
PSA.69.2	Deeper and deeper I sink into the mire;
PSA.69.2	I can’t find a foothold.
PSA.69.2	I am in deep water,
PSA.69.2	and the floods overwhelm me.
PSA.69.3	I am exhausted from crying for help;
PSA.69.3	my throat is parched.
PSA.69.3	My eyes are swollen with weeping,
PSA.69.3	waiting for my God to help me.
PSA.69.4	Those who hate me without cause
PSA.69.4	outnumber the hairs on my head.
PSA.69.4	Many enemies try to destroy me with lies,
PSA.69.4	demanding that I give back what I didn’t steal.
PSA.69.5	O God, you know how foolish I am;
PSA.69.5	my sins cannot be hidden from you.
PSA.69.6	Don’t let those who trust in you be ashamed because of me,
PSA.69.6	O Sovereign 
PSA.69.6	Don’t let me cause them to be humiliated,
PSA.69.6	O God of Israel.
PSA.69.7	For I endure insults for your sake;
PSA.69.7	humiliation is written all over my face.
PSA.69.8	Even my own brothers pretend they don’t know me;
PSA.69.8	they treat me like a stranger.
PSA.69.9	Passion for your house has consumed me,
PSA.69.9	and the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.
PSA.69.10	When I weep and fast,
PSA.69.10	they scoff at me.
PSA.69.11	When I dress in burlap to show sorrow,
PSA.69.11	they make fun of me.
PSA.69.12	I am the favorite topic of town gossip,
PSA.69.12	and all the drunks sing about me.
PSA.69.13	But I keep praying to you, 
PSA.69.13	hoping this time you will show me favor.
PSA.69.13	In your unfailing love, O God,
PSA.69.13	answer my prayer with your sure salvation.
PSA.69.14	Rescue me from the mud;
PSA.69.14	don’t let me sink any deeper!
PSA.69.14	Save me from those who hate me,
PSA.69.14	and pull me from these deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Don’t let the floods overwhelm me,
PSA.69.15	or the deep waters swallow me,
PSA.69.15	or the pit of death devour me.
PSA.69.16	Answer my prayers, O 
PSA.69.16	for your unfailing love is wonderful.
PSA.69.16	Take care of me,
PSA.69.16	for your mercy is so plentiful.
PSA.69.17	Don’t hide from your servant;
PSA.69.17	answer me quickly, for I am in deep trouble!
PSA.69.18	Come and redeem me;
PSA.69.18	free me from my enemies.
PSA.69.19	You know of my shame, scorn, and disgrace.
PSA.69.19	You see all that my enemies are doing.
PSA.69.20	Their insults have broken my heart,
PSA.69.20	and I am in despair.
PSA.69.20	If only one person would show some pity;
PSA.69.20	if only one would turn and comfort me.
PSA.69.21	But instead, they give me poison
PSA.69.21	they offer me sour wine for my thirst.
PSA.69.22	Let the bountiful table set before them become a snare
PSA.69.22	and their prosperity become a trap.
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes go blind so they cannot see,
PSA.69.23	and make their bodies shake continually.
PSA.69.24	Pour out your fury on them;
PSA.69.24	consume them with your burning anger.
PSA.69.25	Let their homes become desolate
PSA.69.25	and their tents be deserted.
PSA.69.26	To the one you have punished, they add insult to injury;
PSA.69.26	they add to the pain of those you have hurt.
PSA.69.27	Pile their sins up high,
PSA.69.27	and don’t let them go free.
PSA.69.28	Erase their names from the Book of Life;
PSA.69.28	don’t let them be counted among the righteous.
PSA.69.29	I am suffering and in pain.
PSA.69.29	Rescue me, O God, by your saving power.
PSA.69.30	Then I will praise God’s name with singing,
PSA.69.30	and I will honor him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.31	For this will please the 
PSA.69.31	more than presenting a bull with its horns and hooves.
PSA.69.32	The humble will see their God at work and be glad.
PSA.69.32	Let all who seek God’s help be encouraged.
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.33	he does not despise his imprisoned people.
PSA.69.34	Praise him, O heaven and earth,
PSA.69.34	the seas and all that move in them.
PSA.69.35	For God will save Jerusalem
PSA.69.35	and rebuild the towns of Judah.
PSA.69.35	His people will live there
PSA.69.35	and settle in their own land.
PSA.69.36	The descendants of those who obey him will inherit the land,
PSA.69.36	and those who love him will live there in safety.
PSA.70.1	Please, God, rescue me!
PSA.70.1	Come quickly, 
PSA.70.2	May those who try to kill me
PSA.70.2	be humiliated and put to shame.
PSA.70.2	May those who take delight in my trouble
PSA.70.2	be turned back in disgrace.
PSA.70.3	Let them be horrified by their shame,
PSA.70.3	for they said, “Aha! We’ve got him now!”
PSA.70.4	But may all who search for you
PSA.70.4	be filled with joy and gladness in you.
PSA.70.4	May those who love your salvation
PSA.70.4	repeatedly shout, “God is great!”
PSA.70.5	But as for me, I am poor and needy;
PSA.70.5	please hurry to my aid, O God.
PSA.70.5	You are my helper and my savior;
PSA.70.5	O 
PSA.71.1	O 
PSA.71.1	don’t let me be disgraced.
PSA.71.2	Save me and rescue me,
PSA.71.2	for you do what is right.
PSA.71.2	Turn your ear to listen to me,
PSA.71.2	and set me free.
PSA.71.3	Be my rock of safety
PSA.71.3	where I can always hide.
PSA.71.3	Give the order to save me,
PSA.71.3	for you are my rock and my fortress.
PSA.71.4	My God, rescue me from the power of the wicked,
PSA.71.4	from the clutches of cruel oppressors.
PSA.71.5	O Lord, you alone are my hope.
PSA.71.5	I’ve trusted you, O 
PSA.71.6	Yes, you have been with me from birth;
PSA.71.6	from my mother’s womb you have cared for me.
PSA.71.6	No wonder I am always praising you!
PSA.71.7	My life is an example to many,
PSA.71.7	because you have been my strength and protection.
PSA.71.8	That is why I can never stop praising you;
PSA.71.8	I declare your glory all day long.
PSA.71.9	And now, in my old age, don’t set me aside.
PSA.71.9	Don’t abandon me when my strength is failing.
PSA.71.10	For my enemies are whispering against me.
PSA.71.10	They are plotting together to kill me.
PSA.71.11	They say, “God has abandoned him.
PSA.71.11	Let’s go and get him,
PSA.71.11	for no one will help him now.”
PSA.71.12	O God, don’t stay away.
PSA.71.12	My God, please hurry to help me.
PSA.71.13	Bring disgrace and destruction on my accusers.
PSA.71.13	Humiliate and shame those who want to harm me.
PSA.71.14	But I will keep on hoping for your help;
PSA.71.14	I will praise you more and more.
PSA.71.15	I will tell everyone about your righteousness.
PSA.71.15	All day long I will proclaim your saving power,
PSA.71.15	though I am not skilled with words.
PSA.71.16	I will praise your mighty deeds, O Sovereign 
PSA.71.16	I will tell everyone that you alone are just.
PSA.71.17	O God, you have taught me from my earliest childhood,
PSA.71.17	and I constantly tell others about the wonderful things you do.
PSA.71.18	Now that I am old and gray,
PSA.71.18	do not abandon me, O God.
PSA.71.18	Let me proclaim your power to this new generation,
PSA.71.18	your mighty miracles to all who come after me.
PSA.71.19	Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the highest heavens.
PSA.71.19	You have done such wonderful things.
PSA.71.19	Who can compare with you, O God?
PSA.71.20	You have allowed me to suffer much hardship,
PSA.71.20	but you will restore me to life again
PSA.71.20	and lift me up from the depths of the earth.
PSA.71.21	You will restore me to even greater honor
PSA.71.21	and comfort me once again.
PSA.71.22	Then I will praise you with music on the harp,
PSA.71.22	because you are faithful to your promises, O my God.
PSA.71.22	I will sing praises to you with a lyre,
PSA.71.22	O Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	I will shout for joy and sing your praises,
PSA.71.23	for you have ransomed me.
PSA.71.24	I will tell about your righteous deeds
PSA.71.24	all day long,
PSA.71.24	for everyone who tried to hurt me
PSA.71.24	has been shamed and humiliated.
PSA.72.1	Give your love of justice to the king, O God,
PSA.72.1	and righteousness to the king’s son.
PSA.72.2	Help him judge your people in the right way;
PSA.72.2	let the poor always be treated fairly.
PSA.72.3	May the mountains yield prosperity for all,
PSA.72.3	and may the hills be fruitful.
PSA.72.4	Help him to defend the poor,
PSA.72.4	to rescue the children of the needy,
PSA.72.4	and to crush their oppressors.
PSA.72.5	May they fear you
PSA.72.5	as long as the moon remains in the sky.
PSA.72.5	Yes, forever!
PSA.72.6	May the king’s rule be refreshing like spring rain on freshly cut grass,
PSA.72.6	like the showers that water the earth.
PSA.72.7	May all the godly flourish during his reign.
PSA.72.7	May there be abundant prosperity until the moon is no more.
PSA.72.8	May he reign from sea to sea,
PSA.72.8	and from the Euphrates River
PSA.72.9	Desert nomads will bow before him;
PSA.72.9	his enemies will fall before him in the dust.
PSA.72.10	The western kings of Tarshish and other distant lands
PSA.72.10	will bring him tribute.
PSA.72.10	The eastern kings of Sheba and Seba
PSA.72.10	will bring him gifts.
PSA.72.11	All kings will bow before him,
PSA.72.11	and all nations will serve him.
PSA.72.12	He will rescue the poor when they cry to him;
PSA.72.12	he will help the oppressed, who have no one to defend them.
PSA.72.13	He feels pity for the weak and the needy,
PSA.72.13	and he will rescue them.
PSA.72.14	He will redeem them from oppression and violence,
PSA.72.14	for their lives are precious to him.
PSA.72.15	Long live the king!
PSA.72.15	May the gold of Sheba be given to him.
PSA.72.15	May the people always pray for him
PSA.72.15	and bless him all day long.
PSA.72.16	May there be abundant grain throughout the land,
PSA.72.16	flourishing even on the hilltops.
PSA.72.16	May the fruit trees flourish like the trees of Lebanon,
PSA.72.16	and may the people thrive like grass in a field.
PSA.72.17	May the king’s name endure forever;
PSA.72.17	may it continue as long as the sun shines.
PSA.72.17	May all nations be blessed through him
PSA.72.17	and bring him praise.
PSA.72.18	Praise the 
PSA.72.18	who alone does such wonderful things.
PSA.72.19	Praise his glorious name forever!
PSA.72.19	Let the whole earth be filled with his glory.
PSA.72.19	Amen and amen!
PSA.72.20	(This ends the prayers of David son of Jesse.)
PSA.73.1	Truly God is good to Israel,
PSA.73.1	to those whose hearts are pure.
PSA.73.2	But as for me, I almost lost my footing.
PSA.73.2	My feet were slipping, and I was almost gone.
PSA.73.3	For I envied the proud
PSA.73.3	when I saw them prosper despite their wickedness.
PSA.73.4	They seem to live such painless lives;
PSA.73.4	their bodies are so healthy and strong.
PSA.73.5	They don’t have troubles like other people;
PSA.73.5	they’re not plagued with problems like everyone else.
PSA.73.6	They wear pride like a jeweled necklace
PSA.73.6	and clothe themselves with cruelty.
PSA.73.7	These fat cats have everything
PSA.73.7	their hearts could ever wish for!
PSA.73.8	They scoff and speak only evil;
PSA.73.8	in their pride they seek to crush others.
PSA.73.9	They boast against the very heavens,
PSA.73.9	and their words strut throughout the earth.
PSA.73.10	And so the people are dismayed and confused,
PSA.73.10	drinking in all their words.
PSA.73.11	“What does God know?” they ask.
PSA.73.11	“Does the Most High even know what’s happening?”
PSA.73.12	Look at these wicked people—
PSA.73.12	enjoying a life of ease while their riches multiply.
PSA.73.13	Did I keep my heart pure for nothing?
PSA.73.13	Did I keep myself innocent for no reason?
PSA.73.14	I get nothing but trouble all day long;
PSA.73.14	every morning brings me pain.
PSA.73.15	If I had really spoken this way to others,
PSA.73.15	I would have been a traitor to your people.
PSA.73.16	So I tried to understand why the wicked prosper.
PSA.73.16	But what a difficult task it is!
PSA.73.17	Then I went into your sanctuary, O God,
PSA.73.17	and I finally understood the destiny of the wicked.
PSA.73.18	Truly, you put them on a slippery path
PSA.73.18	and send them sliding over the cliff to destruction.
PSA.73.19	In an instant they are destroyed,
PSA.73.19	completely swept away by terrors.
PSA.73.20	When you arise, O Lord,
PSA.73.20	you will laugh at their silly ideas
PSA.73.20	as a person laughs at dreams in the morning.
PSA.73.21	Then I realized that my heart was bitter,
PSA.73.21	and I was all torn up inside.
PSA.73.22	I was so foolish and ignorant—
PSA.73.22	I must have seemed like a senseless animal to you.
PSA.73.23	Yet I still belong to you;
PSA.73.23	you hold my right hand.
PSA.73.24	You guide me with your counsel,
PSA.73.24	leading me to a glorious destiny.
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven but you?
PSA.73.25	I desire you more than anything on earth.
PSA.73.26	My health may fail, and my spirit may grow weak,
PSA.73.26	but God remains the strength of my heart;
PSA.73.26	he is mine forever.
PSA.73.27	Those who desert him will perish,
PSA.73.27	for you destroy those who abandon you.
PSA.73.28	But as for me, how good it is to be near God!
PSA.73.28	I have made the Sovereign 
PSA.73.28	and I will tell everyone about the wonderful things you do.
PSA.74.1	O God, why have you rejected us so long?
PSA.74.1	Why is your anger so intense against the sheep of your own pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember that we are the people you chose long ago,
PSA.74.2	the tribe you redeemed as your own special possession!
PSA.74.2	And remember Jerusalem,
PSA.74.3	Walk through the awful ruins of the city;
PSA.74.3	see how the enemy has destroyed your sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	There your enemies shouted their victorious battle cries;
PSA.74.4	there they set up their battle standards.
PSA.74.5	They swung their axes
PSA.74.5	like woodcutters in a forest.
PSA.74.6	With axes and picks,
PSA.74.6	they smashed the carved paneling.
PSA.74.7	They burned your sanctuary to the ground.
PSA.74.7	They defiled the place that bears your name.
PSA.74.8	Then they thought, “Let’s destroy everything!”
PSA.74.8	So they burned down all the places where God was worshiped.
PSA.74.9	We no longer see your miraculous signs.
PSA.74.9	All the prophets are gone,
PSA.74.9	and no one can tell us when it will end.
PSA.74.10	How long, O God, will you allow our enemies to insult you?
PSA.74.10	Will you let them dishonor your name forever?
PSA.74.11	Why do you hold back your strong right hand?
PSA.74.11	Unleash your powerful fist and destroy them.
PSA.74.12	You, O God, are my king from ages past,
PSA.74.12	bringing salvation to the earth.
PSA.74.13	You split the sea by your strength
PSA.74.13	and smashed the heads of the sea monsters.
PSA.74.14	You crushed the heads of Leviathan
PSA.74.14	and let the desert animals eat him.
PSA.74.15	You caused the springs and streams to gush forth,
PSA.74.15	and you dried up rivers that never run dry.
PSA.74.16	Both day and night belong to you;
PSA.74.16	you made the starlight
PSA.74.17	You set the boundaries of the earth,
PSA.74.17	and you made both summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	See how these enemies insult you, 
PSA.74.18	A foolish nation has dishonored your name.
PSA.74.19	Don’t let these wild beasts destroy your turtledoves.
PSA.74.19	Don’t forget your suffering people forever.
PSA.74.20	Remember your covenant promises,
PSA.74.20	for the land is full of darkness and violence!
PSA.74.21	Don’t let the downtrodden be humiliated again.
PSA.74.21	Instead, let the poor and needy praise your name.
PSA.74.22	Arise, O God, and defend your cause.
PSA.74.22	Remember how these fools insult you all day long.
PSA.74.23	Don’t overlook what your enemies have said
PSA.74.23	or their growing uproar.
PSA.75.1	We thank you, O God!
PSA.75.1	We give thanks because you are near.
PSA.75.1	People everywhere tell of your wonderful deeds.
PSA.75.2	God says, “At the time I have planned,
PSA.75.2	I will bring justice against the wicked.
PSA.75.3	When the earth quakes and its people live in turmoil,
PSA.75.3	I am the one who keeps its foundations firm.
PSA.75.3	Interlude
PSA.75.4	“I warned the proud, ‘Stop your boasting!’
PSA.75.4	I told the wicked, ‘Don’t raise your fists!
PSA.75.5	Don’t raise your fists in defiance at the heavens
PSA.75.5	or speak with such arrogance.’”
PSA.75.6	For no one on earth—from east or west,
PSA.75.6	or even from the wilderness—
PSA.75.6	should raise a defiant fist.
PSA.75.7	It is God alone who judges;
PSA.75.7	he decides who will rise and who will fall.
PSA.75.8	For the 
PSA.75.8	that is full of foaming wine mixed with spices.
PSA.75.8	He pours out the wine in judgment,
PSA.75.8	and all the wicked must drink it,
PSA.75.8	draining it to the dregs.
PSA.75.9	But as for me, I will always proclaim what God has done;
PSA.75.9	I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	For God says, “I will break the strength of the wicked,
PSA.75.10	but I will increase the power of the godly.”
PSA.76.1	God is honored in Judah;
PSA.76.1	his name is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	Jerusalem
PSA.76.2	Mount Zion is his home.
PSA.76.3	There he has broken the fiery arrows of the enemy,
PSA.76.3	the shields and swords and weapons of war.
PSA.76.3	Interlude
PSA.76.4	You are glorious and more majestic
PSA.76.4	than the everlasting mountains.
PSA.76.5	Our boldest enemies have been plundered.
PSA.76.5	They lie before us in the sleep of death.
PSA.76.5	No warrior could lift a hand against us.
PSA.76.6	At the blast of your breath, O God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	their horses and chariots lay still.
PSA.76.7	No wonder you are greatly feared!
PSA.76.7	Who can stand before you when your anger explodes?
PSA.76.8	From heaven you sentenced your enemies;
PSA.76.8	the earth trembled and stood silent before you.
PSA.76.9	You stand up to judge those who do evil, O God,
PSA.76.9	and to rescue the oppressed of the earth.
PSA.76.9	Interlude
PSA.76.10	Human defiance only enhances your glory,
PSA.76.10	for you use it as a weapon.
PSA.76.11	Make vows to the 
PSA.76.11	Let everyone bring tribute to the Awesome One.
PSA.76.12	For he breaks the pride of princes,
PSA.76.12	and the kings of the earth fear him.
PSA.77.1	I cry out to God; yes, I shout.
PSA.77.1	Oh, that God would listen to me!
PSA.77.2	When I was in deep trouble,
PSA.77.2	I searched for the Lord.
PSA.77.2	All night long I prayed, with hands lifted toward heaven,
PSA.77.2	but my soul was not comforted.
PSA.77.3	I think of God, and I moan,
PSA.77.3	overwhelmed with longing for his help.
PSA.77.3	Interlude
PSA.77.4	You don’t let me sleep.
PSA.77.4	I am too distressed even to pray!
PSA.77.5	I think of the good old days,
PSA.77.5	long since ended,
PSA.77.6	when my nights were filled with joyful songs.
PSA.77.6	I search my soul and ponder the difference now.
PSA.77.7	Has the Lord rejected me forever?
PSA.77.7	Will he never again be kind to me?
PSA.77.8	Is his unfailing love gone forever?
PSA.77.8	Have his promises permanently failed?
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to be gracious?
PSA.77.9	Has he slammed the door on his compassion?
PSA.77.9	Interlude
PSA.77.10	And I said, “This is my fate;
PSA.77.10	the Most High has turned his hand against me.”
PSA.77.11	But then I recall all you have done, O 
PSA.77.11	I remember your wonderful deeds of long ago.
PSA.77.12	They are constantly in my thoughts.
PSA.77.12	I cannot stop thinking about your mighty works.
PSA.77.13	O God, your ways are holy.
PSA.77.13	Is there any god as mighty as you?
PSA.77.14	You are the God of great wonders!
PSA.77.14	You demonstrate your awesome power among the nations.
PSA.77.15	By your strong arm, you redeemed your people,
PSA.77.15	the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
PSA.77.15	Interlude
PSA.77.16	When the Red Sea
PSA.77.16	its waters looked and trembled!
PSA.77.16	The sea quaked to its very depths.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured down rain;
PSA.77.17	the thunder rumbled in the sky.
PSA.77.17	Your arrows of lightning flashed.
PSA.77.18	Your thunder roared from the whirlwind;
PSA.77.18	the lightning lit up the world!
PSA.77.18	The earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	Your road led through the sea,
PSA.77.19	your pathway through the mighty waters—
PSA.77.19	a pathway no one knew was there!
PSA.77.20	You led your people along that road like a flock of sheep,
PSA.77.20	with Moses and Aaron as their shepherds.
PSA.78.1	O my people, listen to my instructions.
PSA.78.1	Open your ears to what I am saying,
PSA.78.2	for I will speak to you in a parable.
PSA.78.2	I will teach you hidden lessons from our past—
PSA.78.3	stories we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	stories our ancestors handed down to us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide these truths from our children;
PSA.78.4	we will tell the next generation
PSA.78.4	about the glorious deeds of the 
PSA.78.4	about his power and his mighty wonders.
PSA.78.5	For he issued his laws to Jacob;
PSA.78.5	he gave his instructions to Israel.
PSA.78.5	He commanded our ancestors
PSA.78.5	to teach them to their children,
PSA.78.6	so the next generation might know them—
PSA.78.6	even the children not yet born—
PSA.78.6	and they in turn will teach their own children.
PSA.78.7	So each generation should set its hope anew on God,
PSA.78.7	not forgetting his glorious miracles
PSA.78.7	and obeying his commands.
PSA.78.8	Then they will not be like their ancestors—
PSA.78.8	stubborn, rebellious, and unfaithful,
PSA.78.8	refusing to give their hearts to God.
PSA.78.9	The warriors of Ephraim, though armed with bows,
PSA.78.9	turned their backs and fled on the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They did not keep God’s covenant
PSA.78.10	and refused to live by his instructions.
PSA.78.11	They forgot what he had done—
PSA.78.11	the great wonders he had shown them,
PSA.78.12	the miracles he did for their ancestors
PSA.78.12	on the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt.
PSA.78.13	For he divided the sea and led them through,
PSA.78.13	making the water stand up like walls!
PSA.78.14	In the daytime he led them by a cloud,
PSA.78.14	and all night by a pillar of fire.
PSA.78.15	He split open the rocks in the wilderness
PSA.78.15	to give them water, as from a gushing spring.
PSA.78.16	He made streams pour from the rock,
PSA.78.16	making the waters flow down like a river!
PSA.78.17	Yet they kept on sinning against him,
PSA.78.17	rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
PSA.78.18	They stubbornly tested God in their hearts,
PSA.78.18	demanding the foods they craved.
PSA.78.19	They even spoke against God himself, saying,
PSA.78.19	“God can’t give us food in the wilderness.
PSA.78.20	Yes, he can strike a rock so water gushes out,
PSA.78.20	but he can’t give his people bread and meat.”
PSA.78.21	When the 
PSA.78.21	The fire of his wrath burned against Jacob.
PSA.78.21	Yes, his anger rose against Israel,
PSA.78.22	for they did not believe God
PSA.78.22	or trust him to care for them.
PSA.78.23	But he commanded the skies to open;
PSA.78.23	he opened the doors of heaven.
PSA.78.24	He rained down manna for them to eat;
PSA.78.24	he gave them bread from heaven.
PSA.78.25	They ate the food of angels!
PSA.78.25	God gave them all they could hold.
PSA.78.26	He released the east wind in the heavens
PSA.78.26	and guided the south wind by his mighty power.
PSA.78.27	He rained down meat as thick as dust—
PSA.78.27	birds as plentiful as the sand on the seashore!
PSA.78.28	He caused the birds to fall within their camp
PSA.78.28	and all around their tents.
PSA.78.29	The people ate their fill.
PSA.78.29	He gave them what they craved.
PSA.78.30	But before they satisfied their craving,
PSA.78.30	while the meat was yet in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	the anger of God rose against them,
PSA.78.31	and he killed their strongest men.
PSA.78.31	He struck down the finest of Israel’s young men.
PSA.78.32	But in spite of this, the people kept sinning.
PSA.78.32	Despite his wonders, they refused to trust him.
PSA.78.33	So he ended their lives in failure,
PSA.78.33	their years in terror.
PSA.78.34	When God began killing them,
PSA.78.34	they finally sought him.
PSA.78.34	They repented and took God seriously.
PSA.78.35	Then they remembered that God was their rock,
PSA.78.35	that God Most High
PSA.78.36	But all they gave him was lip service;
PSA.78.36	they lied to him with their tongues.
PSA.78.37	Their hearts were not loyal to him.
PSA.78.37	They did not keep his covenant.
PSA.78.38	Yet he was merciful and forgave their sins
PSA.78.38	and did not destroy them all.
PSA.78.38	Many times he held back his anger
PSA.78.38	and did not unleash his fury!
PSA.78.39	For he remembered that they were merely mortal,
PSA.78.39	gone like a breath of wind that never returns.
PSA.78.40	Oh, how often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
PSA.78.40	and grieved his heart in that dry wasteland.
PSA.78.41	Again and again they tested God’s patience
PSA.78.41	and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They did not remember his power
PSA.78.42	and how he rescued them from their enemies.
PSA.78.43	They did not remember his miraculous signs in Egypt,
PSA.78.43	his wonders on the plain of Zoan.
PSA.78.44	For he turned their rivers into blood,
PSA.78.44	so no one could drink from the streams.
PSA.78.45	He sent vast swarms of flies to consume them
PSA.78.45	and hordes of frogs to ruin them.
PSA.78.46	He gave their crops to caterpillars;
PSA.78.46	their harvest was consumed by locusts.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their grapevines with hail
PSA.78.47	and shattered their sycamore-figs with sleet.
PSA.78.48	He abandoned their cattle to the hail,
PSA.78.48	their livestock to bolts of lightning.
PSA.78.49	He loosed on them his fierce anger—
PSA.78.49	all his fury, rage, and hostility.
PSA.78.49	He dispatched against them
PSA.78.49	a band of destroying angels.
PSA.78.50	He turned his anger against them;
PSA.78.50	he did not spare the Egyptians’ lives
PSA.78.50	but ravaged them with the plague.
PSA.78.51	He killed the oldest son in each Egyptian family,
PSA.78.51	the flower of youth throughout the land of Egypt.
PSA.78.52	But he led his own people like a flock of sheep,
PSA.78.52	guiding them safely through the wilderness.
PSA.78.53	He kept them safe so they were not afraid;
PSA.78.53	but the sea covered their enemies.
PSA.78.54	He brought them to the border of his holy land,
PSA.78.54	to this land of hills he had won for them.
PSA.78.55	He drove out the nations before them;
PSA.78.55	he gave them their inheritance by lot.
PSA.78.55	He settled the tribes of Israel into their homes.
PSA.78.56	But they kept testing and rebelling against God Most High.
PSA.78.56	They did not obey his laws.
PSA.78.57	They turned back and were as faithless as their parents.
PSA.78.57	They were as undependable as a crooked bow.
PSA.78.58	They angered God by building shrines to other gods;
PSA.78.58	they made him jealous with their idols.
PSA.78.59	When God heard them, he was very angry,
PSA.78.59	and he completely rejected Israel.
PSA.78.60	Then he abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	the Tabernacle where he had lived among the people.
PSA.78.61	He allowed the Ark of his might to be captured;
PSA.78.61	he surrendered his glory into enemy hands.
PSA.78.62	He gave his people over to be butchered by the sword,
PSA.78.62	because he was so angry with his own people—his special possession.
PSA.78.63	Their young men were killed by fire;
PSA.78.63	their young women died before singing their wedding songs.
PSA.78.64	Their priests were slaughtered,
PSA.78.64	and their widows could not mourn their deaths.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord rose up as though waking from sleep,
PSA.78.65	like a warrior aroused from a drunken stupor.
PSA.78.66	He routed his enemies
PSA.78.66	and sent them to eternal shame.
PSA.78.67	But he rejected Joseph’s descendants;
PSA.78.67	he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
PSA.78.68	He chose instead the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	and Mount Zion, which he loved.
PSA.78.69	There he built his sanctuary as high as the heavens,
PSA.78.69	as solid and enduring as the earth.
PSA.78.70	He chose his servant David,
PSA.78.70	calling him from the sheep pens.
PSA.78.71	He took David from tending the ewes and lambs
PSA.78.71	and made him the shepherd of Jacob’s descendants—
PSA.78.71	God’s own people, Israel.
PSA.78.72	He cared for them with a true heart
PSA.78.72	and led them with skillful hands.
PSA.79.1	O God, pagan nations have conquered your land,
PSA.79.1	your special possession.
PSA.79.1	They have defiled your holy Temple
PSA.79.1	and made Jerusalem a heap of ruins.
PSA.79.2	They have left the bodies of your servants
PSA.79.2	as food for the birds of heaven.
PSA.79.2	The flesh of your godly ones
PSA.79.2	has become food for the wild animals.
PSA.79.3	Blood has flowed like water all around Jerusalem;
PSA.79.3	no one is left to bury the dead.
PSA.79.4	We are mocked by our neighbors,
PSA.79.4	an object of scorn and derision to those around us.
PSA.79.5	O 
PSA.79.5	How long will your jealousy burn like fire?
PSA.79.6	Pour out your wrath on the nations that refuse to acknowledge you—
PSA.79.6	on kingdoms that do not call upon your name.
PSA.79.7	For they have devoured your people Israel,
PSA.79.7	making the land a desolate wilderness.
PSA.79.8	Do not hold us guilty for the sins of our ancestors!
PSA.79.8	Let your compassion quickly meet our needs,
PSA.79.8	for we are on the brink of despair.
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God of our salvation!
PSA.79.9	Help us for the glory of your name.
PSA.79.9	Save us and forgive our sins
PSA.79.9	for the honor of your name.
PSA.79.10	Why should pagan nations be allowed to scoff,
PSA.79.10	asking, “Where is their God?”
PSA.79.10	Show us your vengeance against the nations,
PSA.79.10	for they have spilled the blood of your servants.
PSA.79.11	Listen to the moaning of the prisoners.
PSA.79.11	Demonstrate your great power by saving those condemned to die.
PSA.79.12	O Lord, pay back our neighbors seven times
PSA.79.12	for the scorn they have hurled at you.
PSA.79.13	Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture,
PSA.79.13	will thank you forever and ever,
PSA.79.13	praising your greatness from generation to generation.
PSA.80.1	Please listen, O Shepherd of Israel,
PSA.80.1	you who lead Joseph’s descendants like a flock.
PSA.80.1	O God, enthroned above the cherubim,
PSA.80.1	display your radiant glory
PSA.80.2	to Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh.
PSA.80.2	Show us your mighty power.
PSA.80.2	Come to rescue us!
PSA.80.3	Turn us again to yourself, O God.
PSA.80.3	Make your face shine down upon us.
PSA.80.3	Only then will we be saved.
PSA.80.4	O 
PSA.80.4	how long will you be angry with our prayers?
PSA.80.5	You have fed us with sorrow
PSA.80.5	and made us drink tears by the bucketful.
PSA.80.6	You have made us the scorn
PSA.80.6	Our enemies treat us as a joke.
PSA.80.7	Turn us again to yourself, O God of Heaven’s Armies.
PSA.80.7	Make your face shine down upon us.
PSA.80.7	Only then will we be saved.
PSA.80.8	You brought us from Egypt like a grapevine;
PSA.80.8	you drove away the pagan nations and transplanted us into your land.
PSA.80.9	You cleared the ground for us,
PSA.80.9	and we took root and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	Our shade covered the mountains;
PSA.80.10	our branches covered the mighty cedars.
PSA.80.11	We spread our branches west to the Mediterranean Sea;
PSA.80.11	our shoots spread east to the Euphrates River.
PSA.80.12	But now, why have you broken down our walls
PSA.80.12	so that all who pass by may steal our fruit?
PSA.80.13	The wild boar from the forest devours it,
PSA.80.13	and the wild animals feed on it.
PSA.80.14	Come back, we beg you, O God of Heaven’s Armies.
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven and see our plight.
PSA.80.14	Take care of this grapevine
PSA.80.15	that you yourself have planted,
PSA.80.15	this son you have raised for yourself.
PSA.80.16	For we are chopped up and burned by our enemies.
PSA.80.16	May they perish at the sight of your frown.
PSA.80.17	Strengthen the man you love,
PSA.80.17	the son of your choice.
PSA.80.18	Then we will never abandon you again.
PSA.80.18	Revive us so we can call on your name once more.
PSA.80.19	Turn us again to yourself, O 
PSA.80.19	Make your face shine down upon us.
PSA.80.19	Only then will we be saved.
PSA.81.1	Sing praises to God, our strength.
PSA.81.1	Sing to the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.2	Sing! Beat the tambourine.
PSA.81.2	Play the sweet lyre and the harp.
PSA.81.3	Blow the ram’s horn at new moon,
PSA.81.3	and again at full moon to call a festival!
PSA.81.4	For this is required by the decrees of Israel;
PSA.81.4	it is a regulation of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	He made it a law for Israel
PSA.81.5	when he attacked Egypt to set us free.
PSA.81.5	I heard an unknown voice say,
PSA.81.6	“Now I will take the load from your shoulders;
PSA.81.6	I will free your hands from their heavy tasks.
PSA.81.7	You cried to me in trouble, and I saved you;
PSA.81.7	I answered out of the thundercloud
PSA.81.7	and tested your faith when there was no water at Meribah.
PSA.81.7	Interlude
PSA.81.8	“Listen to me, O my people, while I give you stern warnings.
PSA.81.8	O Israel, if you would only listen to me!
PSA.81.9	You must never have a foreign god;
PSA.81.9	you must not bow down before a false god.
PSA.81.10	For it was I, the 
PSA.81.10	who rescued you from the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it with good things.
PSA.81.11	“But no, my people wouldn’t listen.
PSA.81.11	Israel did not want me around.
PSA.81.12	So I let them follow their own stubborn desires,
PSA.81.12	living according to their own ideas.
PSA.81.13	Oh, that my people would listen to me!
PSA.81.13	Oh, that Israel would follow me, walking in my paths!
PSA.81.14	How quickly I would then subdue their enemies!
PSA.81.14	How soon my hands would be upon their foes!
PSA.81.15	Those who hate the 
PSA.81.15	they would be doomed forever.
PSA.81.16	But I would feed you with the finest wheat.
PSA.81.16	I would satisfy you with wild honey from the rock.”
PSA.82.1	God presides over heaven’s court;
PSA.82.1	he pronounces judgment on the heavenly beings:
PSA.82.2	“How long will you hand down unjust decisions
PSA.82.2	by favoring the wicked?
PSA.82.2	Interlude
PSA.82.3	“Give justice to the poor and the orphan;
PSA.82.3	uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute.
PSA.82.4	Rescue the poor and helpless;
PSA.82.4	deliver them from the grasp of evil people.
PSA.82.5	But these oppressors know nothing;
PSA.82.5	they are so ignorant!
PSA.82.5	They wander about in darkness,
PSA.82.5	while the whole world is shaken to the core.
PSA.82.6	I say, ‘You are gods;
PSA.82.6	you are all children of the Most High.
PSA.82.7	But you will die like mere mortals
PSA.82.7	and fall like every other ruler.’”
PSA.82.8	Rise up, O God, and judge the earth,
PSA.82.8	for all the nations belong to you.
PSA.83.1	O God, do not be silent!
PSA.83.1	Do not be deaf.
PSA.83.1	Do not be quiet, O God.
PSA.83.2	Don’t you hear the uproar of your enemies?
PSA.83.2	Don’t you see that your arrogant enemies are rising up?
PSA.83.3	They devise crafty schemes against your people;
PSA.83.3	they conspire against your precious ones.
PSA.83.4	“Come,” they say, “let us wipe out Israel as a nation.
PSA.83.4	We will destroy the very memory of its existence.”
PSA.83.5	Yes, this was their unanimous decision.
PSA.83.5	They signed a treaty as allies against you—
PSA.83.6	these Edomites and Ishmaelites;
PSA.83.6	Moabites and Hagrites;
PSA.83.7	Gebalites, Ammonites, and Amalekites;
PSA.83.7	and people from Philistia and Tyre.
PSA.83.8	Assyria has joined them, too,
PSA.83.8	and is allied with the descendants of Lot.
PSA.83.8	Interlude
PSA.83.9	Do to them as you did to the Midianites
PSA.83.9	and as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.
PSA.83.10	They were destroyed at Endor,
PSA.83.10	and their decaying corpses fertilized the soil.
PSA.83.11	Let their mighty nobles die as Oreb and Zeeb did.
PSA.83.11	Let all their princes die like Zebah and Zalmunna,
PSA.83.12	for they said, “Let us seize for our own use
PSA.83.12	these pasturelands of God!”
PSA.83.13	O my God, scatter them like tumbleweed,
PSA.83.13	like chaff before the wind!
PSA.83.14	As a fire burns a forest
PSA.83.14	and as a flame sets mountains ablaze,
PSA.83.15	chase them with your fierce storm;
PSA.83.15	terrify them with your tempest.
PSA.83.16	Utterly disgrace them
PSA.83.16	until they submit to your name, O 
PSA.83.17	Let them be ashamed and terrified forever.
PSA.83.17	Let them die in disgrace.
PSA.83.18	Then they will learn that you alone are called the 
PSA.83.18	that you alone are the Most High,
PSA.83.18	supreme over all the earth.
PSA.84.1	How lovely is your dwelling place,
PSA.84.1	O 
PSA.84.2	I long, yes, I faint with longing
PSA.84.2	to enter the courts of the 
PSA.84.2	With my whole being, body and soul,
PSA.84.2	I will shout joyfully to the living God.
PSA.84.3	Even the sparrow finds a home,
PSA.84.3	and the swallow builds her nest and raises her young
PSA.84.3	at a place near your altar,
PSA.84.3	O 
PSA.84.4	What joy for those who can live in your house,
PSA.84.4	always singing your praises.
PSA.84.4	Interlude
PSA.84.5	What joy for those whose strength comes from the 
PSA.84.5	who have set their minds on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
PSA.84.6	When they walk through the Valley of Weeping,
PSA.84.6	it will become a place of refreshing springs.
PSA.84.6	The autumn rains will clothe it with blessings.
PSA.84.7	They will continue to grow stronger,
PSA.84.7	and each of them will appear before God in Jerusalem.
PSA.84.8	O 
PSA.84.8	Listen, O God of Jacob.
PSA.84.8	Interlude
PSA.84.9	O God, look with favor upon the king, our shield!
PSA.84.9	Show favor to the one you have anointed.
PSA.84.10	A single day in your courts
PSA.84.10	is better than a thousand anywhere else!
PSA.84.10	I would rather be a gatekeeper in the house of my God
PSA.84.10	than live the good life in the homes of the wicked.
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.11	He gives us grace and glory.
PSA.84.11	The 
PSA.84.11	from those who do what is right.
PSA.84.12	O 
PSA.84.12	what joy for those who trust in you.
PSA.85.1	, you poured out blessings on your land!
PSA.85.1	You restored the fortunes of Israel.
PSA.85.2	You forgave the guilt of your people—
PSA.85.2	yes, you covered all their sins.
PSA.85.2	Interlude
PSA.85.3	You held back your fury.
PSA.85.3	You kept back your blazing anger.
PSA.85.4	Now restore us again, O God of our salvation.
PSA.85.4	Put aside your anger against us once more.
PSA.85.5	Will you be angry with us always?
PSA.85.5	Will you prolong your wrath to all generations?
PSA.85.6	Won’t you revive us again,
PSA.85.6	so your people can rejoice in you?
PSA.85.7	Show us your unfailing love, O 
PSA.85.7	and grant us your salvation.
PSA.85.8	I listen carefully to what God the 
PSA.85.8	for he speaks peace to his faithful people.
PSA.85.8	But let them not return to their foolish ways.
PSA.85.9	Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him,
PSA.85.9	so our land will be filled with his glory.
PSA.85.10	Unfailing love and truth have met together.
PSA.85.10	Righteousness and peace have kissed!
PSA.85.11	Truth springs up from the earth,
PSA.85.11	and righteousness smiles down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	Yes, the 
PSA.85.12	Our land will yield its bountiful harvest.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness goes as a herald before him,
PSA.85.13	preparing the way for his steps.
PSA.86.1	Bend down, O 
PSA.86.1	answer me, for I need your help.
PSA.86.2	Protect me, for I am devoted to you.
PSA.86.2	Save me, for I serve you and trust you.
PSA.86.2	You are my God.
PSA.86.3	Be merciful to me, O Lord,
PSA.86.3	for I am calling on you constantly.
PSA.86.4	Give me happiness, O Lord,
PSA.86.4	for I give myself to you.
PSA.86.5	O Lord, you are so good, so ready to forgive,
PSA.86.5	so full of unfailing love for all who ask for your help.
PSA.86.6	Listen closely to my prayer, O 
PSA.86.6	hear my urgent cry.
PSA.86.7	I will call to you whenever I’m in trouble,
PSA.86.7	and you will answer me.

PSA.86.8	None can do what you do!
PSA.86.9	All the nations you made
PSA.86.9	will come and bow before you, Lord;
PSA.86.9	they will praise your holy name.
PSA.86.10	For you are great and perform wonderful deeds.
PSA.86.10	You alone are God.
PSA.86.11	Teach me your ways, O 
PSA.86.11	that I may live according to your truth!
PSA.86.11	Grant me purity of heart,
PSA.86.11	so that I may honor you.
PSA.86.12	With all my heart I will praise you, O Lord my God.
PSA.86.12	I will give glory to your name forever,
PSA.86.13	for your love for me is very great.
PSA.86.13	You have rescued me from the depths of death.
PSA.86.14	O God, insolent people rise up against me;
PSA.86.14	a violent gang is trying to kill me.
PSA.86.14	You mean nothing to them.
PSA.86.15	But you, O Lord,
PSA.86.15	are a God of compassion and mercy,
PSA.86.15	slow to get angry
PSA.86.15	and filled with unfailing love and faithfulness.
PSA.86.16	Look down and have mercy on me.
PSA.86.16	Give your strength to your servant;
PSA.86.16	save me, the son of your servant.
PSA.86.17	Send me a sign of your favor.
PSA.86.17	Then those who hate me will be put to shame,
PSA.86.17	for you, O 
PSA.87.1	On the holy mountain
PSA.87.1	stands the city founded by the

PSA.88.1	I cry out to you by day.
PSA.88.1	I come to you at night.
PSA.88.2	Now hear my prayer;
PSA.88.2	listen to my cry.
PSA.88.3	For my life is full of troubles,
PSA.88.3	and death
PSA.88.4	I am as good as dead,
PSA.88.4	like a strong man with no strength left.
PSA.88.5	They have left me among the dead,
PSA.88.5	and I lie like a corpse in a grave.
PSA.88.5	I am forgotten,
PSA.88.5	cut off from your care.
PSA.88.6	You have thrown me into the lowest pit,
PSA.88.6	into the darkest depths.
PSA.88.7	Your anger weighs me down;
PSA.88.7	with wave after wave you have engulfed me.
PSA.88.7	Interlude
PSA.88.8	You have driven my friends away
PSA.88.8	by making me repulsive to them.
PSA.88.8	I am in a trap with no way of escape.
PSA.88.9	My eyes are blinded by my tears.
PSA.88.9	Each day I beg for your help, O 
PSA.88.9	I lift my hands to you for mercy.
PSA.88.10	Are your wonderful deeds of any use to the dead?
PSA.88.10	Do the dead rise up and praise you?
PSA.88.10	Interlude
PSA.88.11	Can those in the grave declare your unfailing love?
PSA.88.11	Can they proclaim your faithfulness in the place of destruction?
PSA.88.12	Can the darkness speak of your wonderful deeds?
PSA.88.12	Can anyone in the land of forgetfulness talk about your righteousness?
PSA.88.13	O 
PSA.88.13	I will keep on pleading day by day.
PSA.88.14	O 
PSA.88.14	Why do you turn your face from me?
PSA.88.15	I have been sick and close to death since my youth.
PSA.88.15	I stand helpless and desperate before your terrors.
PSA.88.16	Your fierce anger has overwhelmed me.
PSA.88.16	Your terrors have paralyzed me.
PSA.88.17	They swirl around me like floodwaters all day long.
PSA.88.17	They have engulfed me completely.
PSA.88.18	You have taken away my companions and loved ones.
PSA.88.18	Darkness is my closest friend.
PSA.89.1	I will sing of the

PSA.89.17	It pleases you to make us strong.
PSA.89.18	Yes, our protection comes from the

PSA.89.20	I have anointed him with my holy oil.
PSA.89.21	I will steady him with my hand;
PSA.89.21	with my powerful arm I will make him strong.
PSA.89.22	His enemies will not defeat him,
PSA.89.22	nor will the wicked overpower him.
PSA.89.23	I will beat down his adversaries before him
PSA.89.23	and destroy those who hate him.
PSA.89.24	My faithfulness and unfailing love will be with him,
PSA.89.24	and by my authority he will grow in power.
PSA.89.25	I will extend his rule over the sea,
PSA.89.25	his dominion over the rivers.
PSA.89.26	And he will call out to me, ‘You are my Father,
PSA.89.26	my God, and the Rock of my salvation.’
PSA.89.27	I will make him my firstborn son,
PSA.89.27	the mightiest king on earth.
PSA.89.28	I will love him and be kind to him forever;
PSA.89.28	my covenant with him will never end.
PSA.89.29	I will preserve an heir for him;
PSA.89.29	his throne will be as endless as the days of heaven.
PSA.89.30	But if his descendants forsake my instructions
PSA.89.30	and fail to obey my regulations,
PSA.89.31	if they do not obey my decrees
PSA.89.31	and fail to keep my commands,
PSA.89.32	then I will punish their sin with the rod,
PSA.89.32	and their disobedience with beating.
PSA.89.33	But I will never stop loving him
PSA.89.33	nor fail to keep my promise to him.
PSA.89.34	No, I will not break my covenant;
PSA.89.34	I will not take back a single word I said.
PSA.89.35	I have sworn an oath to David,
PSA.89.35	and in my holiness I cannot lie:
PSA.89.36	His dynasty will go on forever;
PSA.89.36	his kingdom will endure as the sun.
PSA.89.37	It will be as eternal as the moon,
PSA.89.37	my faithful witness in the sky!”
PSA.89.37	Interlude
PSA.89.38	But now you have rejected him and cast him off.
PSA.89.38	You are angry with your anointed king.
PSA.89.39	You have renounced your covenant with him;
PSA.89.39	you have thrown his crown in the dust.
PSA.89.40	You have broken down the walls protecting him
PSA.89.40	and ruined every fort defending him.
PSA.89.41	Everyone who comes along has robbed him,
PSA.89.41	and he has become a joke to his neighbors.
PSA.89.42	You have strengthened his enemies
PSA.89.42	and made them all rejoice.
PSA.89.43	You have made his sword useless
PSA.89.43	and refused to help him in battle.
PSA.89.44	You have ended his splendor
PSA.89.44	and overturned his throne.
PSA.89.45	You have made him old before his time
PSA.89.45	and publicly disgraced him.
PSA.89.45	Interlude
PSA.89.46	O 
PSA.89.46	Will you hide yourself forever?
PSA.89.46	How long will your anger burn like fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember how short my life is,
PSA.89.47	how empty and futile this human existence!
PSA.89.48	No one can live forever; all will die.
PSA.89.48	No one can escape the power of the grave.
PSA.89.48	Interlude
PSA.89.49	Lord, where is your unfailing love?
PSA.89.49	You promised it to David with a faithful pledge.
PSA.89.50	Consider, Lord, how your servants are disgraced!
PSA.89.50	I carry in my heart the insults of so many people.
PSA.89.51	Your enemies have mocked me, O 
PSA.89.51	they mock your anointed king wherever he goes.
PSA.89.52	Praise the 
PSA.89.52	Amen and amen!
PSA.90.1	Lord, through all the generations
PSA.90.1	you have been our home!
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were born,
PSA.90.2	before you gave birth to the earth and the world,
PSA.90.2	from beginning to end, you are God.
PSA.90.3	You turn people back to dust, saying,
PSA.90.3	“Return to dust, you mortals!”
PSA.90.4	For you, a thousand years are as a passing day,
PSA.90.4	as brief as a few night hours.
PSA.90.5	You sweep people away like dreams that disappear.
PSA.90.5	They are like grass that springs up in the morning.
PSA.90.6	In the morning it blooms and flourishes,
PSA.90.6	but by evening it is dry and withered.
PSA.90.7	We wither beneath your anger;
PSA.90.7	we are overwhelmed by your fury.
PSA.90.8	You spread out our sins before you—
PSA.90.8	our secret sins—and you see them all.
PSA.90.9	We live our lives beneath your wrath,
PSA.90.9	ending our years with a groan.
PSA.90.10	Seventy years are given to us!
PSA.90.10	Some even live to eighty.
PSA.90.10	But even the best years are filled with pain and trouble;
PSA.90.10	soon they disappear, and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	Who can comprehend the power of your anger?
PSA.90.11	Your wrath is as awesome as the fear you deserve.
PSA.90.12	Teach us to realize the brevity of life,
PSA.90.12	so that we may grow in wisdom.
PSA.90.13	O 
PSA.90.13	How long will you delay?
PSA.90.13	Take pity on your servants!
PSA.90.14	Satisfy us each morning with your unfailing love,
PSA.90.14	so we may sing for joy to the end of our lives.
PSA.90.15	Give us gladness in proportion to our former misery!
PSA.90.15	Replace the evil years with good.
PSA.90.16	Let us, your servants, see you work again;
PSA.90.16	let our children see your glory.
PSA.90.17	And may the Lord our God show us his approval
PSA.90.17	and make our efforts successful.
PSA.90.17	Yes, make our efforts successful!
PSA.91.1	Those who live in the shelter of the Most High
PSA.91.1	will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	This I declare about the 
PSA.91.2	He alone is my refuge, my place of safety;
PSA.91.2	he is my God, and I trust him.
PSA.91.3	For he will rescue you from every trap
PSA.91.3	and protect you from deadly disease.
PSA.91.4	He will cover you with his feathers.
PSA.91.4	He will shelter you with his wings.
PSA.91.4	His faithful promises are your armor and protection.
PSA.91.5	Do not be afraid of the terrors of the night,
PSA.91.5	nor the arrow that flies in the day.
PSA.91.6	Do not dread the disease that stalks in darkness,
PSA.91.6	nor the disaster that strikes at midday.
PSA.91.7	Though a thousand fall at your side,
PSA.91.7	though ten thousand are dying around you,
PSA.91.7	these evils will not touch you.
PSA.91.8	Just open your eyes,
PSA.91.8	and see how the wicked are punished.
PSA.91.9	If you make the 
PSA.91.9	if you make the Most High your shelter,
PSA.91.10	no evil will conquer you;
PSA.91.10	no plague will come near your home.
PSA.91.11	For he will order his angels
PSA.91.11	to protect you wherever you go.
PSA.91.12	They will hold you up with their hands
PSA.91.12	so you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone.
PSA.91.13	You will trample upon lions and cobras;
PSA.91.13	you will crush fierce lions and serpents under your feet!
PSA.91.14	The 
PSA.91.14	I will protect those who trust in my name.
PSA.91.15	When they call on me, I will answer;
PSA.91.15	I will be with them in trouble.
PSA.91.15	I will rescue and honor them.
PSA.91.16	I will reward them with a long life
PSA.91.16	and give them my salvation.”
PSA.92.1	It is good to give thanks to the 
PSA.92.1	to sing praises to the Most High.
PSA.92.2	It is good to proclaim your unfailing love in the morning,
PSA.92.2	your faithfulness in the evening,
PSA.92.3	accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument, a harp,
PSA.92.3	and the melody of a lyre.
PSA.92.4	You thrill me, 
PSA.92.4	I sing for joy because of what you have done.
PSA.92.5	O 
PSA.92.5	And how deep are your thoughts.
PSA.92.6	Only a simpleton would not know,
PSA.92.6	and only a fool would not understand this:
PSA.92.7	Though the wicked sprout like weeds
PSA.92.7	and evildoers flourish,
PSA.92.7	they will be destroyed forever.
PSA.92.8	But you, O 
PSA.92.9	Your enemies, 
PSA.92.9	all evildoers will be scattered.
PSA.92.10	But you have made me as strong as a wild ox.
PSA.92.10	You have anointed me with the finest oil.
PSA.92.11	My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies;
PSA.92.11	my ears have heard the defeat of my wicked opponents.
PSA.92.12	But the godly will flourish like palm trees
PSA.92.12	and grow strong like the cedars of Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	For they are transplanted to the 
PSA.92.13	They flourish in the courts of our God.
PSA.92.14	Even in old age they will still produce fruit;
PSA.92.14	they will remain vital and green.
PSA.92.15	They will declare, “The 
PSA.92.15	He is my rock!
PSA.92.15	There is no evil in him!”
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.1	Indeed, the 
PSA.93.1	The world stands firm
PSA.93.1	and cannot be shaken.
PSA.93.2	Your throne, O 
PSA.93.2	You yourself are from the everlasting past.
PSA.93.3	The floods have risen up, O 
PSA.93.3	The floods have roared like thunder;
PSA.93.3	the floods have lifted their pounding waves.
PSA.93.4	But mightier than the violent raging of the seas,
PSA.93.4	mightier than the breakers on the shore—
PSA.93.4	the 
PSA.93.5	Your royal laws cannot be changed.
PSA.93.5	Your reign, O 
PSA.94.1	O 
PSA.94.1	O God of vengeance, let your glorious justice shine forth!
PSA.94.2	Arise, O Judge of the earth.
PSA.94.2	Give the proud what they deserve.
PSA.94.3	How long, O 
PSA.94.3	How long will the wicked be allowed to gloat?
PSA.94.4	How long will they speak with arrogance?
PSA.94.4	How long will these evil people boast?
PSA.94.5	They crush your people, 
PSA.94.5	hurting those you claim as your own.
PSA.94.6	They kill widows and foreigners
PSA.94.6	and murder orphans.
PSA.94.7	“The 
PSA.94.7	“and besides, the God of Israel
PSA.94.8	Think again, you fools!
PSA.94.8	When will you finally catch on?
PSA.94.9	Is he deaf—the one who made your ears?
PSA.94.9	Is he blind—the one who formed your eyes?
PSA.94.10	He punishes the nations—won’t he also punish you?
PSA.94.10	He knows everything—doesn’t he also know what you are doing?
PSA.94.11	The 
PSA.94.11	he knows they are worthless!
PSA.94.12	Joyful are those you discipline, 
PSA.94.12	those you teach with your instructions.
PSA.94.13	You give them relief from troubled times
PSA.94.13	until a pit is dug to capture the wicked.
PSA.94.14	The 
PSA.94.14	he will not abandon his special possession.
PSA.94.15	Judgment will again be founded on justice,
PSA.94.15	and those with virtuous hearts will pursue it.
PSA.94.16	Who will protect me from the wicked?
PSA.94.16	Who will stand up for me against evildoers?
PSA.94.17	Unless the 
PSA.94.17	I would soon have settled in the silence of the grave.
PSA.94.18	I cried out, “I am slipping!”
PSA.94.18	but your unfailing love, O 
PSA.94.19	When doubts filled my mind,
PSA.94.19	your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer.
PSA.94.20	Can unjust leaders claim that God is on their side—
PSA.94.20	leaders whose decrees permit injustice?
PSA.94.21	They gang up against the righteous
PSA.94.21	and condemn the innocent to death.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.22	my God is the mighty rock where I hide.
PSA.94.23	God will turn the sins of evil people back on them.
PSA.94.23	He will destroy them for their sins.
PSA.94.23	The 
PSA.95.1	Come, let us sing to the 
PSA.95.1	Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation.
PSA.95.2	Let us come to him with thanksgiving.
PSA.95.2	Let us sing psalms of praise to him.
PSA.95.3	For the 
PSA.95.3	a great King above all gods.
PSA.95.4	He holds in his hands the depths of the earth
PSA.95.4	and the mightiest mountains.
PSA.95.5	The sea belongs to him, for he made it.
PSA.95.5	His hands formed the dry land, too.
PSA.95.6	Come, let us worship and bow down.
PSA.95.6	Let us kneel before the 
PSA.95.7	for he is our God.
PSA.95.7	We are the people he watches over,
PSA.95.7	the flock under his care.
PSA.95.7	If only you would listen to his voice today!
PSA.95.8	The 
PSA.95.8	as they did at Massah in the wilderness.
PSA.95.9	For there your ancestors tested and tried my patience,
PSA.95.9	even though they saw everything I did.
PSA.95.10	For forty years I was angry with them, and I said,
PSA.95.10	‘They are a people whose hearts turn away from me.
PSA.95.10	They refuse to do what I tell them.’
PSA.95.11	So in my anger I took an oath:
PSA.95.11	‘They will never enter my place of rest.’”
PSA.96.1	Sing a new song to the 
PSA.96.1	Let the whole earth sing to the 
PSA.96.2	Sing to the 
PSA.96.2	Each day proclaim the good news that he saves.
PSA.96.3	Publish his glorious deeds among the nations.
PSA.96.3	Tell everyone about the amazing things he does.
PSA.96.4	Great is the 
PSA.96.4	He is to be feared above all gods.
PSA.96.5	The gods of other nations are mere idols,
PSA.96.5	but the 
PSA.96.6	Honor and majesty surround him;
PSA.96.6	strength and beauty fill his sanctuary.
PSA.96.7	O nations of the world, recognize the 
PSA.96.7	recognize that the 
PSA.96.8	Give to the 
PSA.96.8	Bring your offering and come into his courts.
PSA.96.9	Worship the 
PSA.96.9	Let all the earth tremble before him.
PSA.96.10	Tell all the nations, “The 
PSA.96.10	The world stands firm and cannot be shaken.
PSA.96.10	He will judge all peoples fairly.
PSA.96.11	Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice!
PSA.96.11	Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise!
PSA.96.12	Let the fields and their crops burst out with joy!
PSA.96.12	Let the trees of the forest sing for joy
PSA.96.13	before the 
PSA.96.13	He is coming to judge the earth.
PSA.96.13	He will judge the world with justice,
PSA.96.13	and the nations with his truth.
PSA.97.1	The 
PSA.97.1	Let the earth rejoice!
PSA.97.1	Let the farthest coastlands be glad.
PSA.97.2	Dark clouds surround him.
PSA.97.2	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
PSA.97.3	Fire spreads ahead of him
PSA.97.3	and burns up all his foes.
PSA.97.4	His lightning flashes out across the world.
PSA.97.4	The earth sees and trembles.
PSA.97.5	The mountains melt like wax before the 
PSA.97.5	before the Lord of all the earth.
PSA.97.6	The heavens proclaim his righteousness;
PSA.97.6	every nation sees his glory.
PSA.97.7	Those who worship idols are disgraced—
PSA.97.7	all who brag about their worthless gods—
PSA.97.7	for every god must bow to him.
PSA.97.8	Jerusalem
PSA.97.8	and all the towns of Judah are glad
PSA.97.8	because of your justice, O 
PSA.97.9	For you, O 
PSA.97.9	you are exalted far above all gods.
PSA.97.10	You who love the 
PSA.97.10	He protects the lives of his godly people
PSA.97.10	and rescues them from the power of the wicked.
PSA.97.11	Light shines on the godly,
PSA.97.11	and joy on those whose hearts are right.
PSA.97.12	May all who are godly rejoice in the 
PSA.97.12	and praise his holy name!
PSA.98.1	Sing a new song to the 
PSA.98.1	for he has done wonderful deeds.
PSA.98.1	His right hand has won a mighty victory;
PSA.98.1	his holy arm has shown his saving power!

PSA.98.2	and has revealed his righteousness to every nation!

PSA.98.3	The ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.
PSA.98.4	Shout to the 
PSA.98.4	break out in praise and sing for joy!
PSA.98.5	Sing your praise to the

PSA.98.6	with trumpets and the sound of the ram’s horn.
PSA.98.6	Make a joyful symphony before the 
PSA.98.7	Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise!
PSA.98.7	Let the earth and all living things join in.
PSA.98.8	Let the rivers clap their hands in glee!
PSA.98.8	Let the hills sing out their songs of joy
PSA.98.9	before the 
PSA.98.9	for he is coming to judge the earth.
PSA.98.9	He will judge the world with justice,
PSA.98.9	and the nations with fairness.
PSA.99.1	The 
PSA.99.1	Let the nations tremble!
PSA.99.1	He sits on his throne between the cherubim.
PSA.99.1	Let the whole earth quake!

PSA.99.4	you have established fairness.
PSA.99.4	You have acted with justice
PSA.99.4	and righteousness throughout Israel.
PSA.99.5	Exalt the 
PSA.99.5	Bow low before his feet, for he is holy!
PSA.99.6	Moses and Aaron were among his priests;
PSA.99.6	Samuel also called on his name.
PSA.99.6	They cried to the 
PSA.99.6	and he answered them.
PSA.99.7	He spoke to Israel from the pillar of cloud,
PSA.99.7	and they followed the laws and decrees he gave them.
PSA.99.8	O 
PSA.99.8	You were a forgiving God to them,
PSA.99.8	but you punished them when they went wrong.
PSA.99.9	Exalt the 
PSA.99.9	and worship at his holy mountain in Jerusalem,
PSA.99.9	for the 
PSA.100.1	Shout with joy to the

PSA.100.4	Give thanks to him and praise his name.
PSA.100.5	For the 
PSA.100.5	His unfailing love continues forever,
PSA.100.5	and his faithfulness continues to each generation.
PSA.101.1	I will sing of your love and justice, 
PSA.101.1	I will praise you with songs.
PSA.101.2	I will be careful to live a blameless life—
PSA.101.2	when will you come to help me?
PSA.101.2	I will lead a life of integrity
PSA.101.2	in my own home.
PSA.101.3	I will refuse to look at
PSA.101.3	anything vile and vulgar.
PSA.101.3	I hate all who deal crookedly;
PSA.101.3	I will have nothing to do with them.
PSA.101.4	I will reject perverse ideas
PSA.101.4	and stay away from every evil.
PSA.101.5	I will not tolerate people who slander their neighbors.
PSA.101.5	I will not endure conceit and pride.
PSA.101.6	I will search for faithful people
PSA.101.6	to be my companions.
PSA.101.6	Only those who are above reproach
PSA.101.6	will be allowed to serve me.
PSA.101.7	I will not allow deceivers to serve in my house,
PSA.101.7	and liars will not stay in my presence.
PSA.101.8	My daily task will be to ferret out the wicked
PSA.101.8	and free the city of the 
PSA.102.1	, hear my prayer!
PSA.102.1	Listen to my plea!
PSA.102.2	Don’t turn away from me
PSA.102.2	in my time of distress.
PSA.102.2	Bend down to listen,
PSA.102.2	and answer me quickly when I call to you.
PSA.102.3	For my days disappear like smoke,
PSA.102.3	and my bones burn like red-hot coals.
PSA.102.4	My heart is sick, withered like grass,
PSA.102.4	and I have lost my appetite.
PSA.102.5	Because of my groaning,
PSA.102.5	I am reduced to skin and bones.
PSA.102.6	I am like an owl in the desert,
PSA.102.6	like a little owl in a far-off wilderness.
PSA.102.7	I lie awake,
PSA.102.7	lonely as a solitary bird on the roof.
PSA.102.8	My enemies taunt me day after day.
PSA.102.8	They mock and curse me.
PSA.102.9	I eat ashes for food.
PSA.102.9	My tears run down into my drink
PSA.102.10	because of your anger and wrath.
PSA.102.10	For you have picked me up and thrown me out.
PSA.102.11	My life passes as swiftly as the evening shadows.
PSA.102.11	I am withering away like grass.
PSA.102.12	But you, O 
PSA.102.12	Your fame will endure to every generation.
PSA.102.13	You will arise and have mercy on Jerusalem
PSA.102.13	and now is the time to pity her,
PSA.102.13	now is the time you promised to help.
PSA.102.14	For your people love every stone in her walls
PSA.102.14	and cherish even the dust in her streets.
PSA.102.15	Then the nations will tremble before the 
PSA.102.15	The kings of the earth will tremble before his glory.
PSA.102.16	For the 
PSA.102.16	He will appear in his glory.
PSA.102.17	He will listen to the prayers of the destitute.
PSA.102.17	He will not reject their pleas.
PSA.102.18	Let this be recorded for future generations,
PSA.102.18	so that a people not yet born will praise the 
PSA.102.19	Tell them the 
PSA.102.19	from his heavenly sanctuary.
PSA.102.19	He looked down to earth from heaven
PSA.102.20	to hear the groans of the prisoners,
PSA.102.20	to release those condemned to die.
PSA.102.21	And so the 
PSA.102.21	his praises in Jerusalem,
PSA.102.22	when multitudes gather together
PSA.102.22	and kingdoms come to worship the 
PSA.102.23	He broke my strength in midlife,
PSA.102.23	cutting short my days.
PSA.102.24	But I cried to him, “O my God, who lives forever,
PSA.102.24	don’t take my life while I am so young!
PSA.102.25	Long ago you laid the foundation of the earth
PSA.102.25	and made the heavens with your hands.
PSA.102.26	They will perish, but you remain forever;
PSA.102.26	they will wear out like old clothing.
PSA.102.26	You will change them like a garment
PSA.102.26	and discard them.
PSA.102.27	But you are always the same;
PSA.102.27	you will live forever.
PSA.102.28	The children of your people
PSA.102.28	will live in security.
PSA.102.28	Their children’s children
PSA.102.28	will thrive in your presence.”
PSA.103.1	Let all that I am praise the 
PSA.103.1	with my whole heart, I will praise his holy name.
PSA.103.2	Let all that I am praise the 
PSA.103.2	may I never forget the good things he does for me.
PSA.103.3	He forgives all my sins
PSA.103.3	and heals all my diseases.
PSA.103.4	He redeems me from death
PSA.103.4	and crowns me with love and tender mercies.
PSA.103.5	He fills my life with good things.
PSA.103.5	My youth is renewed like the eagle’s!
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.6	and justice to all who are treated unfairly.
PSA.103.7	He revealed his character to Moses
PSA.103.7	and his deeds to the people of Israel.
PSA.103.8	The 
PSA.103.8	slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love.
PSA.103.9	He will not constantly accuse us,
PSA.103.9	nor remain angry forever.
PSA.103.10	He does not punish us for all our sins;
PSA.103.10	he does not deal harshly with us, as we deserve.
PSA.103.11	For his unfailing love toward those who fear him
PSA.103.11	is as great as the height of the heavens above the earth.
PSA.103.12	He has removed our sins as far from us
PSA.103.12	as the east is from the west.
PSA.103.13	The 
PSA.103.13	tender and compassionate to those who fear him.
PSA.103.14	For he knows how weak we are;
PSA.103.14	he remembers we are only dust.
PSA.103.15	Our days on earth are like grass;
PSA.103.15	like wildflowers, we bloom and die.
PSA.103.16	The wind blows, and we are gone—
PSA.103.16	as though we had never been here.
PSA.103.17	But the love of the 
PSA.103.17	with those who fear him.
PSA.103.17	His salvation extends to the children’s children
PSA.103.18	of those who are faithful to his covenant,
PSA.103.18	of those who obey his commandments!
PSA.103.19	The 
PSA.103.19	from there he rules over everything.
PSA.103.20	Praise the 
PSA.103.20	you mighty ones who carry out his plans,
PSA.103.20	listening for each of his commands.
PSA.103.21	Yes, praise the 
PSA.103.21	who serve him and do his will!
PSA.103.22	Praise the 
PSA.103.22	everything in all his kingdom.
PSA.103.22	Let all that I am praise the 
PSA.104.1	Let all that I am praise the 
PSA.104.1	O 
PSA.104.1	You are robed with honor and majesty.
PSA.104.2	You are dressed in a robe of light.
PSA.104.2	You stretch out the starry curtain of the heavens;
PSA.104.3	you lay out the rafters of your home in the rain clouds.
PSA.104.3	You make the clouds your chariot;
PSA.104.3	you ride upon the wings of the wind.
PSA.104.4	The winds are your messengers;
PSA.104.4	flames of fire are your servants.
PSA.104.5	You placed the world on its foundation
PSA.104.5	so it would never be moved.
PSA.104.6	You clothed the earth with floods of water,
PSA.104.6	water that covered even the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At your command, the water fled;
PSA.104.7	at the sound of your thunder, it hurried away.
PSA.104.8	Mountains rose and valleys sank
PSA.104.8	to the levels you decreed.
PSA.104.9	Then you set a firm boundary for the seas,
PSA.104.9	so they would never again cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	You make springs pour water into the ravines,
PSA.104.10	so streams gush down from the mountains.
PSA.104.11	They provide water for all the animals,
PSA.104.11	and the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	The birds nest beside the streams
PSA.104.12	and sing among the branches of the trees.
PSA.104.13	You send rain on the mountains from your heavenly home,
PSA.104.13	and you fill the earth with the fruit of your labor.
PSA.104.14	You cause grass to grow for the livestock
PSA.104.14	and plants for people to use.
PSA.104.14	You allow them to produce food from the earth—
PSA.104.15	wine to make them glad,
PSA.104.15	olive oil to soothe their skin,
PSA.104.15	and bread to give them strength.
PSA.104.16	The trees of the 
PSA.104.16	the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
PSA.104.17	There the birds make their nests,
PSA.104.17	and the storks make their homes in the cypresses.
PSA.104.18	High in the mountains live the wild goats,
PSA.104.18	and the rocks form a refuge for the hyraxes.
PSA.104.19	You made the moon to mark the seasons,
PSA.104.19	and the sun knows when to set.
PSA.104.20	You send the darkness, and it becomes night,
PSA.104.20	when all the forest animals prowl about.
PSA.104.21	Then the young lions roar for their prey,
PSA.104.21	stalking the food provided by God.
PSA.104.22	At dawn they slink back
PSA.104.22	into their dens to rest.
PSA.104.23	Then people go off to their work,
PSA.104.23	where they labor until evening.
PSA.104.24	O 
PSA.104.24	In wisdom you have made them all.
PSA.104.24	The earth is full of your creatures.
PSA.104.25	Here is the ocean, vast and wide,
PSA.104.25	teeming with life of every kind,
PSA.104.25	both large and small.
PSA.104.26	See the ships sailing along,
PSA.104.26	and Leviathan,
PSA.104.27	They all depend on you
PSA.104.27	to give them food as they need it.
PSA.104.28	When you supply it, they gather it.
PSA.104.28	You open your hand to feed them,
PSA.104.28	and they are richly satisfied.
PSA.104.29	But if you turn away from them, they panic.
PSA.104.29	When you take away their breath,
PSA.104.29	they die and turn again to dust.
PSA.104.30	When you give them your breath,
PSA.104.30	and you renew the face of the earth.
PSA.104.31	May the glory of the 
PSA.104.31	The 
PSA.104.32	The earth trembles at his glance;
PSA.104.32	the mountains smoke at his touch.
PSA.104.33	I will sing to the 
PSA.104.33	I will praise my God to my last breath!
PSA.104.34	May all my thoughts be pleasing to him,
PSA.104.34	for I rejoice in the 
PSA.104.35	Let all sinners vanish from the face of the earth;
PSA.104.35	let the wicked disappear forever.
PSA.104.35	Let all that I am praise the 
PSA.104.35	Praise the 
PSA.105.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.105.1	Let the whole world know what he has done.
PSA.105.2	Sing to him; yes, sing his praises.
PSA.105.2	Tell everyone about his wonderful deeds.
PSA.105.3	Exult in his holy name;
PSA.105.3	rejoice, you who worship the 
PSA.105.4	Search for the 
PSA.105.4	continually seek him.
PSA.105.5	Remember the wonders he has performed,
PSA.105.5	his miracles, and the rulings he has given,
PSA.105.6	you children of his servant Abraham,
PSA.105.6	you descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones.
PSA.105.7	He is the 
PSA.105.7	His justice is seen throughout the land.
PSA.105.8	He always stands by his covenant—
PSA.105.8	the commitment he made to a thousand generations.
PSA.105.9	This is the covenant he made with Abraham
PSA.105.9	and the oath he swore to Isaac.
PSA.105.10	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
PSA.105.10	and to the people of Israel as a never-ending covenant:
PSA.105.11	“I will give you the land of Canaan
PSA.105.11	as your special possession.”
PSA.105.12	He said this when they were few in number,
PSA.105.12	a tiny group of strangers in Canaan.
PSA.105.13	They wandered from nation to nation,
PSA.105.13	from one kingdom to another.
PSA.105.14	Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.
PSA.105.14	He warned kings on their behalf:
PSA.105.15	“Do not touch my chosen people,
PSA.105.15	and do not hurt my prophets.”
PSA.105.16	He called for a famine on the land of Canaan,
PSA.105.16	cutting off its food supply.
PSA.105.17	Then he sent someone to Egypt ahead of them—
PSA.105.17	Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
PSA.105.18	They bruised his feet with fetters
PSA.105.18	and placed his neck in an iron collar.
PSA.105.19	Until the time came to fulfill his dreams,
PSA.105.19	the 
PSA.105.20	Then Pharaoh sent for him and set him free;
PSA.105.20	the ruler of the nation opened his prison door.
PSA.105.21	Joseph was put in charge of all the king’s household;
PSA.105.21	he became ruler over all the king’s possessions.
PSA.105.22	He could instruct
PSA.105.22	and teach the king’s advisers.
PSA.105.23	Then Israel arrived in Egypt;
PSA.105.23	Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	And the 
PSA.105.24	until they became too mighty for their enemies.
PSA.105.25	Then he turned the Egyptians against the Israelites,
PSA.105.25	and they plotted against the 
PSA.105.26	But the 
PSA.105.26	along with Aaron, whom he had chosen.
PSA.105.27	They performed miraculous signs among the Egyptians,
PSA.105.27	and wonders in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	The 
PSA.105.28	for they had defied
PSA.105.29	He turned their water into blood,
PSA.105.29	poisoning all the fish.
PSA.105.30	Then frogs overran the land
PSA.105.30	and even invaded the king’s bedrooms.
PSA.105.31	When the 
PSA.105.31	and gnats swarmed across Egypt.
PSA.105.32	He sent them hail instead of rain,
PSA.105.32	and lightning flashed over the land.
PSA.105.33	He ruined their grapevines and fig trees
PSA.105.33	and shattered all the trees.
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and hordes of locusts came—
PSA.105.34	young locusts beyond number.
PSA.105.35	They ate up everything green in the land,
PSA.105.35	destroying all the crops in their fields.
PSA.105.36	Then he killed the oldest son in each Egyptian home,
PSA.105.36	the pride and joy of each family.
PSA.105.37	The 
PSA.105.37	and not one among the tribes of Israel even stumbled.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they were gone,
PSA.105.38	for they feared them greatly.
PSA.105.39	The 
PSA.105.39	and gave them a great fire to light the darkness.
PSA.105.40	They asked for meat, and he sent them quail;
PSA.105.40	he satisfied their hunger with manna—bread from heaven.
PSA.105.41	He split open a rock, and water gushed out
PSA.105.41	to form a river through the dry wasteland.
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his sacred promise
PSA.105.42	to his servant Abraham.
PSA.105.43	So he brought his people out of Egypt with joy,
PSA.105.43	his chosen ones with rejoicing.
PSA.105.44	He gave his people the lands of pagan nations,
PSA.105.44	and they harvested crops that others had planted.
PSA.105.45	All this happened so they would follow his decrees
PSA.105.45	and obey his instructions.
PSA.105.45	Praise the 
PSA.106.1	Praise the 
PSA.106.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.106.1	His faithful love endures forever.
PSA.106.2	Who can list the glorious miracles of the 
PSA.106.2	Who can ever praise him enough?
PSA.106.3	There is joy for those who deal justly with others
PSA.106.3	and always do what is right.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, 
PSA.106.4	come near and rescue me.
PSA.106.5	Let me share in the prosperity of your chosen ones.
PSA.106.5	Let me rejoice in the joy of your people;
PSA.106.5	let me praise you with those who are your heritage.
PSA.106.6	Like our ancestors, we have sinned.
PSA.106.6	We have done wrong! We have acted wickedly!
PSA.106.7	Our ancestors in Egypt
PSA.106.7	were not impressed by the 
PSA.106.7	They soon forgot his many acts of kindness to them.
PSA.106.7	Instead, they rebelled against him at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	Even so, he saved them—
PSA.106.8	to defend the honor of his name
PSA.106.8	and to demonstrate his mighty power.
PSA.106.9	He commanded the Red Sea
PSA.106.9	He led Israel across the sea as if it were a desert.
PSA.106.10	So he rescued them from their enemies
PSA.106.10	and redeemed them from their foes.
PSA.106.11	Then the water returned and covered their enemies;
PSA.106.11	not one of them survived.
PSA.106.12	Then his people believed his promises.
PSA.106.12	Then they sang his praise.
PSA.106.13	Yet how quickly they forgot what he had done!
PSA.106.13	They wouldn’t wait for his counsel!
PSA.106.14	In the wilderness their desires ran wild,
PSA.106.14	testing God’s patience in that dry wasteland.
PSA.106.15	So he gave them what they asked for,
PSA.106.15	but he sent a plague along with it.
PSA.106.16	The people in the camp were jealous of Moses
PSA.106.16	and envious of Aaron, the 
PSA.106.17	Because of this, the earth opened up;
PSA.106.17	it swallowed Dathan
PSA.106.17	and buried Abiram and the other rebels.
PSA.106.18	Fire fell upon their followers;
PSA.106.18	a flame consumed the wicked.
PSA.106.19	The people made a calf at Mount Sinai
PSA.106.19	they bowed before an image made of gold.
PSA.106.20	They traded their glorious God
PSA.106.20	for a statue of a grass-eating bull.
PSA.106.21	They forgot God, their savior,
PSA.106.21	who had done such great things in Egypt—
PSA.106.22	such wonderful things in the land of Ham,
PSA.106.22	such awesome deeds at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.23	So he declared he would destroy them.
PSA.106.23	But Moses, his chosen one, stepped between the 
PSA.106.23	He begged him to turn from his anger and not destroy them.
PSA.106.24	The people refused to enter the pleasant land,
PSA.106.24	for they wouldn’t believe his promise to care for them.
PSA.106.25	Instead, they grumbled in their tents
PSA.106.25	and refused to obey the 
PSA.106.26	Therefore, he solemnly swore
PSA.106.26	that he would kill them in the wilderness,
PSA.106.27	that he would scatter their descendants
PSA.106.27	exiling them to distant lands.
PSA.106.28	Then our ancestors joined in the worship of Baal at Peor;
PSA.106.28	they even ate sacrifices offered to the dead!
PSA.106.29	They angered the 
PSA.106.29	so a plague broke out among them.
PSA.106.30	But Phinehas had the courage to intervene,
PSA.106.30	and the plague was stopped.
PSA.106.31	So he has been regarded as a righteous man
PSA.106.31	ever since that time.
PSA.106.32	At Meribah, too, they angered the 
PSA.106.32	causing Moses serious trouble.
PSA.106.33	They made Moses angry,
PSA.106.33	and he spoke foolishly.
PSA.106.34	Israel failed to destroy the nations in the land,
PSA.106.34	as the 
PSA.106.35	Instead, they mingled among the pagans
PSA.106.35	and adopted their evil customs.
PSA.106.36	They worshiped their idols,
PSA.106.36	which led to their downfall.
PSA.106.37	They even sacrificed their sons
PSA.106.37	and their daughters to the demons.
PSA.106.38	They shed innocent blood,
PSA.106.38	the blood of their sons and daughters.
PSA.106.38	By sacrificing them to the idols of Canaan,
PSA.106.38	they polluted the land with murder.
PSA.106.39	They defiled themselves by their evil deeds,
PSA.106.39	and their love of idols was adultery in the 
PSA.106.40	That is why the 
PSA.106.40	and he abhorred his own special possession.
PSA.106.41	He handed them over to pagan nations,
PSA.106.41	and they were ruled by those who hated them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies crushed them
PSA.106.42	and brought them under their cruel power.
PSA.106.43	Again and again he rescued them,
PSA.106.43	but they chose to rebel against him,
PSA.106.43	and they were finally destroyed by their sin.
PSA.106.44	Even so, he pitied them in their distress
PSA.106.44	and listened to their cries.
PSA.106.45	He remembered his covenant with them
PSA.106.45	and relented because of his unfailing love.
PSA.106.46	He even caused their captors
PSA.106.46	to treat them with kindness.
PSA.106.47	Save us, O 
PSA.106.47	Gather us back from among the nations,
PSA.106.47	so we can thank your holy name
PSA.106.47	and rejoice and praise you.
PSA.106.48	Praise the 
PSA.106.48	who lives from everlasting to everlasting!
PSA.106.48	Let all the people say, “Amen!”
PSA.106.48	Praise the 
PSA.107.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.107.1	His faithful love endures forever.
PSA.107.2	Has the 
PSA.107.2	Tell others he has redeemed you from your enemies.
PSA.107.3	For he has gathered the exiles from many lands,
PSA.107.3	from east and west,
PSA.107.3	from north and south.
PSA.107.4	Some wandered in the wilderness,
PSA.107.4	lost and homeless.
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty,
PSA.107.5	they nearly died.
PSA.107.6	“
PSA.107.6	and he rescued them from their distress.
PSA.107.7	He led them straight to safety,
PSA.107.7	to a city where they could live.
PSA.107.8	Let them praise the 
PSA.107.8	and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
PSA.107.9	For he satisfies the thirsty
PSA.107.9	and fills the hungry with good things.
PSA.107.10	Some sat in darkness and deepest gloom,
PSA.107.10	imprisoned in iron chains of misery.
PSA.107.11	They rebelled against the words of God,
PSA.107.11	scorning the counsel of the Most High.
PSA.107.12	That is why he broke them with hard labor;
PSA.107.12	they fell, and no one was there to help them.
PSA.107.13	“
PSA.107.13	and he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.14	He led them from the darkness and deepest gloom;
PSA.107.14	he snapped their chains.
PSA.107.15	Let them praise the 
PSA.107.15	and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
PSA.107.16	For he broke down their prison gates of bronze;
PSA.107.16	he cut apart their bars of iron.
PSA.107.17	Some were fools; they rebelled
PSA.107.17	and suffered for their sins.
PSA.107.18	They couldn’t stand the thought of food,
PSA.107.18	and they were knocking on death’s door.
PSA.107.19	“
PSA.107.19	and he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.20	He sent out his word and healed them,
PSA.107.20	snatching them from the door of death.
PSA.107.21	Let them praise the 
PSA.107.21	and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
PSA.107.22	Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving
PSA.107.22	and sing joyfully about his glorious acts.
PSA.107.23	Some went off to sea in ships,
PSA.107.23	plying the trade routes of the world.
PSA.107.24	They, too, observed the 
PSA.107.24	his impressive works on the deepest seas.
PSA.107.25	He spoke, and the winds rose,
PSA.107.25	stirring up the waves.
PSA.107.26	Their ships were tossed to the heavens
PSA.107.26	and plunged again to the depths;
PSA.107.26	the sailors cringed in terror.
PSA.107.27	They reeled and staggered like drunkards
PSA.107.27	and were at their wits’ end.
PSA.107.28	“
PSA.107.28	and he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.29	He calmed the storm to a whisper
PSA.107.29	and stilled the waves.
PSA.107.30	What a blessing was that stillness
PSA.107.30	as he brought them safely into harbor!
PSA.107.31	Let them praise the 
PSA.107.31	and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt him publicly before the congregation
PSA.107.32	and before the leaders of the nation.
PSA.107.33	He changes rivers into deserts,
PSA.107.33	and springs of water into dry, thirsty land.
PSA.107.34	He turns the fruitful land into salty wastelands,
PSA.107.34	because of the wickedness of those who live there.
PSA.107.35	But he also turns deserts into pools of water,
PSA.107.35	the dry land into springs of water.
PSA.107.36	He brings the hungry to settle there
PSA.107.36	and to build their cities.
PSA.107.37	They sow their fields, plant their vineyards,
PSA.107.37	and harvest their bumper crops.
PSA.107.38	How he blesses them!
PSA.107.38	They raise large families there,
PSA.107.38	and their herds of livestock increase.
PSA.107.39	When they decrease in number and become impoverished
PSA.107.39	through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,
PSA.107.40	the 
PSA.107.40	causing them to wander in trackless wastelands.
PSA.107.41	But he rescues the poor from trouble
PSA.107.41	and increases their families like flocks of sheep.
PSA.107.42	The godly will see these things and be glad,
PSA.107.42	while the wicked are struck silent.
PSA.107.43	Those who are wise will take all this to heart;
PSA.107.43	they will see in our history the faithful love of the 
PSA.108.1	My heart is confident in you, O God;
PSA.108.1	no wonder I can sing your praises with all my heart!
PSA.108.2	Wake up, lyre and harp!
PSA.108.2	I will wake the dawn with my song.
PSA.108.3	I will thank you, 
PSA.108.3	I will sing your praises among the nations.
PSA.108.4	For your unfailing love is higher than the heavens.
PSA.108.4	Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
PSA.108.5	Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens.
PSA.108.5	May your glory shine over all the earth.
PSA.108.6	Now rescue your beloved people.
PSA.108.6	Answer and save us by your power.
PSA.108.7	God has promised this by his holiness
PSA.108.7	“I will divide up Shechem with joy.
PSA.108.7	I will measure out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead is mine,
PSA.108.8	and Manasseh, too.
PSA.108.8	Ephraim, my helmet, will produce my warriors,
PSA.108.8	and Judah, my scepter, will produce my kings.
PSA.108.9	But Moab, my washbasin, will become my servant,
PSA.108.9	and I will wipe my feet on Edom
PSA.108.9	and shout in triumph over Philistia.”
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me into the fortified city?
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me victory over Edom?
PSA.108.11	Have you rejected us, O God?
PSA.108.11	Will you no longer march with our armies?
PSA.108.12	Oh, please help us against our enemies,
PSA.108.12	for all human help is useless.
PSA.108.13	With God’s help we will do mighty things,
PSA.108.13	for he will trample down our foes.
PSA.109.1	O God, whom I praise,
PSA.109.1	don’t stand silent and aloof
PSA.109.2	while the wicked slander me
PSA.109.2	and tell lies about me.
PSA.109.3	They surround me with hateful words
PSA.109.3	and fight against me for no reason.
PSA.109.4	I love them, but they try to destroy me with accusations
PSA.109.4	even as I am praying for them!
PSA.109.5	They repay evil for good,
PSA.109.5	and hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	They say,
PSA.109.6	Send an accuser to bring him to trial.
PSA.109.7	When his case comes up for judgment,
PSA.109.7	let him be pronounced guilty.
PSA.109.7	Count his prayers as sins.
PSA.109.8	Let his years be few;
PSA.109.8	let someone else take his position.
PSA.109.9	May his children become fatherless,
PSA.109.9	and his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	May his children wander as beggars
PSA.109.10	and be driven from
PSA.109.11	May creditors seize his entire estate,
PSA.109.11	and strangers take all he has earned.
PSA.109.12	Let no one be kind to him;
PSA.109.12	let no one pity his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	May all his offspring die.
PSA.109.13	May his family name be blotted out in the next generation.
PSA.109.14	May the 
PSA.109.14	may his mother’s sins never be erased from the record.
PSA.109.15	May the 
PSA.109.15	and may his name disappear from human memory.
PSA.109.16	For he refused all kindness to others;
PSA.109.16	he persecuted the poor and needy,
PSA.109.16	and he hounded the brokenhearted to death.
PSA.109.17	He loved to curse others;
PSA.109.17	now you curse him.
PSA.109.17	He never blessed others;
PSA.109.17	now don’t you bless him.
PSA.109.18	Cursing is as natural to him as his clothing,
PSA.109.18	or the water he drinks,
PSA.109.18	or the rich food he eats.
PSA.109.19	Now may his curses return and cling to him like clothing;
PSA.109.19	may they be tied around him like a belt.”
PSA.109.20	May those curses become the 
PSA.109.20	for my accusers who speak evil of me.
PSA.109.21	But deal well with me, O Sovereign 
PSA.109.21	for the sake of your own reputation!
PSA.109.21	Rescue me
PSA.109.21	because you are so faithful and good.
PSA.109.22	For I am poor and needy,
PSA.109.22	and my heart is full of pain.
PSA.109.23	I am fading like a shadow at dusk;
PSA.109.23	I am brushed off like a locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak from fasting,
PSA.109.24	and I am skin and bones.
PSA.109.25	I am a joke to people everywhere;
PSA.109.25	when they see me, they shake their heads in scorn.
PSA.109.26	Help me, O 
PSA.109.26	Save me because of your unfailing love.
PSA.109.27	Let them see that this is your doing,
PSA.109.27	that you yourself have done it, 
PSA.109.28	Then let them curse me if they like,
PSA.109.28	but you will bless me!
PSA.109.28	When they attack me, they will be disgraced!
PSA.109.28	But I, your servant, will go right on rejoicing!
PSA.109.29	May my accusers be clothed with disgrace;
PSA.109.29	may their humiliation cover them like a cloak.
PSA.109.30	But I will give repeated thanks to the 
PSA.109.30	praising him to everyone.
PSA.109.31	For he stands beside the needy,
PSA.109.31	ready to save them from those who condemn them.

PSA.110.1	“Sit in the place of honor at my right hand
PSA.110.1	until I humble your enemies,
PSA.110.1	making them a footstool under your feet.”

PSA.110.2	you will rule over your enemies.
PSA.110.3	When you go to war,
PSA.110.3	your people will serve you willingly.

PSA.110.5	The Lord stands at your right hand to protect you.
PSA.110.5	He will strike down many kings when his anger erupts.
PSA.110.6	He will punish the nations
PSA.110.6	and fill their lands with corpses;
PSA.110.6	he will shatter heads over the whole earth.
PSA.110.7	But he himself will be refreshed from brooks along the way.
PSA.110.7	He will be victorious.

PSA.111.8	They are forever true,
PSA.111.8	to be obeyed faithfully and with integrity.
PSA.111.9	He has paid a full ransom for his people.
PSA.111.9	He has guaranteed his covenant with them forever.

PSA.112.4	They are generous, compassionate, and righteous.
PSA.112.5	Good comes to those who lend money generously
PSA.112.5	and conduct their business fairly.
PSA.112.6	Such people will not be overcome by evil.
PSA.112.6	Those who are righteous will be long remembered.

PSA.113.1	Praise the 
PSA.113.1	Yes, give praise, O servants of the 
PSA.113.1	Praise the name of the

PSA.113.3	praise the name of the 
PSA.113.4	For the 
PSA.113.4	his glory is higher than the heavens.
PSA.113.5	Who can be compared with the 
PSA.113.5	who is enthroned on high?
PSA.113.6	He stoops to look down
PSA.113.6	on heaven and on earth.
PSA.113.7	He lifts the poor from the dust
PSA.113.7	and the needy from the garbage dump.
PSA.113.8	He sets them among princes,
PSA.113.8	even the princes of his own people!
PSA.113.9	He gives the childless woman a family,
PSA.113.9	making her a happy mother.
PSA.113.9	Praise the 
PSA.114.1	When the Israelites escaped from Egypt—
PSA.114.1	when the family of Jacob left that foreign land—
PSA.114.2	the land of Judah became God’s sanctuary,
PSA.114.2	and Israel became his kingdom.
PSA.114.3	The Red Sea
PSA.114.3	The water of the Jordan River turned away.
PSA.114.4	The mountains skipped like rams,
PSA.114.4	the hills like lambs!
PSA.114.5	What’s wrong, Red Sea, that made you hurry out of their way?
PSA.114.5	What happened, Jordan River, that you turned away?
PSA.114.6	Why, mountains, did you skip like rams?
PSA.114.6	Why, hills, like lambs?
PSA.114.7	Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,
PSA.114.7	at the presence of the God of Jacob.
PSA.114.8	He turned the rock into a pool of water;
PSA.114.8	yes, a spring of water flowed from solid rock.
PSA.115.1	Not to us, O 
PSA.115.1	but to your name goes all the glory
PSA.115.1	for your unfailing love and faithfulness.
PSA.115.2	Why let the nations say,
PSA.115.2	“Where is their God?”
PSA.115.3	Our God is in the heavens,
PSA.115.3	and he does as he wishes.
PSA.115.4	Their idols are merely things of silver and gold,
PSA.115.4	shaped by human hands.
PSA.115.5	They have mouths but cannot speak,
PSA.115.5	and eyes but cannot see.
PSA.115.6	They have ears but cannot hear,
PSA.115.6	and noses but cannot smell.
PSA.115.7	They have hands but cannot feel,
PSA.115.7	and feet but cannot walk,
PSA.115.7	and throats but cannot make a sound.
PSA.115.8	And those who make idols are just like them,
PSA.115.8	as are all who trust in them.
PSA.115.9	O Israel, trust the 
PSA.115.9	He is your helper and your shield.
PSA.115.10	O priests, descendants of Aaron, trust the 
PSA.115.10	He is your helper and your shield.
PSA.115.11	All you who fear the 
PSA.115.11	He is your helper and your shield.
PSA.115.12	The 
PSA.115.12	He will bless the people of Israel
PSA.115.12	and bless the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
PSA.115.13	He will bless those who fear the 
PSA.115.13	both great and lowly.
PSA.115.14	May the 
PSA.115.14	both you and your children.
PSA.115.15	May you be blessed by the 
PSA.115.15	who made heaven and earth.
PSA.115.16	The heavens belong to the 
PSA.115.16	but he has given the earth to all humanity.
PSA.115.17	The dead cannot sing praises to the 
PSA.115.17	for they have gone into the silence of the grave.
PSA.115.18	But we can praise the 
PSA.115.18	both now and forever!
PSA.115.18	Praise the 
PSA.116.1	I love the 
PSA.116.1	and my prayer for mercy.
PSA.116.2	Because he bends down to listen,
PSA.116.2	I will pray as long as I have breath!
PSA.116.3	Death wrapped its ropes around me;
PSA.116.3	the terrors of the grave
PSA.116.3	I saw only trouble and sorrow.
PSA.116.4	Then I called on the name of the 
PSA.116.4	“Please, 
PSA.116.5	How kind the 
PSA.116.5	So merciful, this God of ours!
PSA.116.6	The 
PSA.116.6	I was facing death, and he saved me.
PSA.116.7	Let my soul be at rest again,
PSA.116.7	for the 
PSA.116.8	He has saved me from death,
PSA.116.8	my eyes from tears,
PSA.116.8	my feet from stumbling.
PSA.116.9	And so I walk in the 
PSA.116.9	as I live here on earth!
PSA.116.10	I believed in you, so I said,
PSA.116.10	“I am deeply troubled, 
PSA.116.11	In my anxiety I cried out to you,
PSA.116.11	“These people are all liars!”
PSA.116.12	What can I offer the 
PSA.116.12	for all he has done for me?
PSA.116.13	I will lift up the cup of salvation
PSA.116.13	and praise the 
PSA.116.14	I will keep my promises to the 
PSA.116.14	in the presence of all his people.
PSA.116.15	The 
PSA.116.15	when his loved ones die.
PSA.116.16	O 
PSA.116.16	yes, I am your servant, born into your household;
PSA.116.16	you have freed me from my chains.
PSA.116.17	I will offer you a sacrifice of thanksgiving
PSA.116.17	and call on the name of the 
PSA.116.18	I will fulfill my vows to the 
PSA.116.18	in the presence of all his people—
PSA.116.19	in the house of the 
PSA.116.19	in the heart of Jerusalem.
PSA.116.19	Praise the 
PSA.117.1	Praise the 
PSA.117.1	Praise him, all you people of the earth.
PSA.117.2	For his unfailing love for us is powerful;
PSA.117.2	the 
PSA.117.2	Praise the 
PSA.118.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.118.1	His faithful love endures forever.
PSA.118.2	Let all Israel repeat:
PSA.118.2	“His faithful love endures forever.”
PSA.118.3	Let Aaron’s descendants, the priests, repeat:
PSA.118.3	“His faithful love endures forever.”
PSA.118.4	Let all who fear the 
PSA.118.4	“His faithful love endures forever.”
PSA.118.5	In my distress I prayed to the 
PSA.118.5	and the 
PSA.118.6	The 
PSA.118.6	What can mere people do to me?
PSA.118.7	Yes, the 
PSA.118.7	I will look in triumph at those who hate me.
PSA.118.8	It is better to take refuge in the 
PSA.118.8	than to trust in people.
PSA.118.9	It is better to take refuge in the 
PSA.118.9	than to trust in princes.
PSA.118.10	Though hostile nations surrounded me,
PSA.118.10	I destroyed them all with the authority of the 
PSA.118.11	Yes, they surrounded and attacked me,
PSA.118.11	but I destroyed them all with the authority of the 
PSA.118.12	They swarmed around me like bees;
PSA.118.12	they blazed against me like a crackling fire.
PSA.118.12	But I destroyed them all with the authority of the 
PSA.118.13	My enemies did their best to kill me,
PSA.118.13	but the 
PSA.118.14	The 
PSA.118.14	he has given me victory.
PSA.118.15	Songs of joy and victory are sung in the camp of the godly.
PSA.118.15	The strong right arm of the 
PSA.118.16	The strong right arm of the 
PSA.118.16	The strong right arm of the 
PSA.118.17	I will not die; instead, I will live
PSA.118.17	to tell what the 
PSA.118.18	The 
PSA.118.18	but he did not let me die.
PSA.118.19	Open for me the gates where the righteous enter,
PSA.118.19	and I will go in and thank the 
PSA.118.20	These gates lead to the presence of the 
PSA.118.20	and the godly enter there.
PSA.118.21	I thank you for answering my prayer
PSA.118.21	and giving me victory!
PSA.118.22	The stone that the builders rejected
PSA.118.22	has now become the cornerstone.
PSA.118.23	This is the 
PSA.118.23	and it is wonderful to see.
PSA.118.24	This is the day the 
PSA.118.24	We will rejoice and be glad in it.

PSA.118.29	Give thanks to the 
PSA.118.29	His faithful love endures forever.

PSA.119.1	who follow the instructions of the 
PSA.119.2	Joyful are those who obey his laws
PSA.119.2	and search for him with all their hearts.
PSA.119.3	They do not compromise with evil,
PSA.119.3	and they walk only in his paths.
PSA.119.4	You have charged us
PSA.119.4	to keep your commandments carefully.
PSA.119.5	Oh, that my actions would consistently
PSA.119.5	reflect your decrees!
PSA.119.6	Then I will not be ashamed
PSA.119.6	when I compare my life with your commands.
PSA.119.7	As I learn your righteous regulations,
PSA.119.7	I will thank you by living as I should!
PSA.119.8	I will obey your decrees.
PSA.119.8	Please don’t give up on me!
PSA.119.9	How can a young person stay pure?
PSA.119.9	By obeying your word.
PSA.119.10	I have tried hard to find you—
PSA.119.10	don’t let me wander from your commands.
PSA.119.11	I have hidden your word in my heart,
PSA.119.11	that I might not sin against you.
PSA.119.12	I praise you, O 
PSA.119.12	teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.13	I have recited aloud
PSA.119.13	all the regulations you have given us.
PSA.119.14	I have rejoiced in your laws
PSA.119.14	as much as in riches.
PSA.119.15	I will study your commandments
PSA.119.15	and reflect on your ways.
PSA.119.16	I will delight in your decrees
PSA.119.16	and not forget your word.
PSA.119.17	Be good to your servant,
PSA.119.17	that I may live and obey your word.
PSA.119.18	Open my eyes to see
PSA.119.18	the wonderful truths in your instructions.
PSA.119.19	I am only a foreigner in the land.
PSA.119.19	Don’t hide your commands from me!
PSA.119.20	I am always overwhelmed
PSA.119.20	with a desire for your regulations.
PSA.119.21	You rebuke the arrogant;
PSA.119.21	those who wander from your commands are cursed.
PSA.119.22	Don’t let them scorn and insult me,
PSA.119.22	for I have obeyed your laws.
PSA.119.23	Even princes sit and speak against me,
PSA.119.23	but I will meditate on your decrees.
PSA.119.24	Your laws please me;
PSA.119.24	they give me wise advice.
PSA.119.25	I lie in the dust;
PSA.119.25	revive me by your word.
PSA.119.26	I told you my plans, and you answered.
PSA.119.26	Now teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.27	Help me understand the meaning of your commandments,
PSA.119.27	and I will meditate on your wonderful deeds.
PSA.119.28	I weep with sorrow;
PSA.119.28	encourage me by your word.
PSA.119.29	Keep me from lying to myself;
PSA.119.29	give me the privilege of knowing your instructions.
PSA.119.30	I have chosen to be faithful;
PSA.119.30	I have determined to live by your regulations.
PSA.119.31	I cling to your laws.
PSA.119.31	, don’t let me be put to shame!
PSA.119.32	I will pursue your commands,
PSA.119.32	for you expand my understanding.
PSA.119.33	Teach me your decrees, O 
PSA.119.33	I will keep them to the end.
PSA.119.34	Give me understanding and I will obey your instructions;
PSA.119.34	I will put them into practice with all my heart.
PSA.119.35	Make me walk along the path of your commands,
PSA.119.35	for that is where my happiness is found.
PSA.119.36	Give me an eagerness for your laws
PSA.119.36	rather than a love for money!
PSA.119.37	Turn my eyes from worthless things,
PSA.119.37	and give me life through your word.
PSA.119.38	Reassure me of your promise,
PSA.119.38	made to those who fear you.
PSA.119.39	Help me abandon my shameful ways;
PSA.119.39	for your regulations are good.
PSA.119.40	I long to obey your commandments!
PSA.119.40	Renew my life with your goodness.
PSA.119.41	, give me your unfailing love,
PSA.119.41	the salvation that you promised me.
PSA.119.42	Then I can answer those who taunt me,
PSA.119.42	for I trust in your word.
PSA.119.43	Do not snatch your word of truth from me,
PSA.119.43	for your regulations are my only hope.
PSA.119.44	I will keep on obeying your instructions
PSA.119.44	forever and ever.
PSA.119.45	I will walk in freedom,
PSA.119.45	for I have devoted myself to your commandments.
PSA.119.46	I will speak to kings about your laws,
PSA.119.46	and I will not be ashamed.
PSA.119.47	How I delight in your commands!
PSA.119.47	How I love them!
PSA.119.48	I honor and love your commands.
PSA.119.48	I meditate on your decrees.
PSA.119.49	Remember your promise to me;
PSA.119.49	it is my only hope.
PSA.119.50	Your promise revives me;
PSA.119.50	it comforts me in all my troubles.
PSA.119.51	The proud hold me in utter contempt,
PSA.119.51	but I do not turn away from your instructions.
PSA.119.52	I meditate on your age-old regulations;
PSA.119.52	O 
PSA.119.53	I become furious with the wicked,
PSA.119.53	because they reject your instructions.
PSA.119.54	Your decrees have been the theme of my songs
PSA.119.54	wherever I have lived.
PSA.119.55	I reflect at night on who you are, O 
PSA.119.55	therefore, I obey your instructions.
PSA.119.56	This is how I spend my life:
PSA.119.56	obeying your commandments.
PSA.119.57	, you are mine!
PSA.119.57	I promise to obey your words!
PSA.119.58	With all my heart I want your blessings.
PSA.119.58	Be merciful as you promised.
PSA.119.59	I pondered the direction of my life,
PSA.119.59	and I turned to follow your laws.
PSA.119.60	I will hurry, without delay,
PSA.119.60	to obey your commands.
PSA.119.61	Evil people try to drag me into sin,
PSA.119.61	but I am firmly anchored to your instructions.
PSA.119.62	I rise at midnight to thank you
PSA.119.62	for your just regulations.
PSA.119.63	I am a friend to anyone who fears you—
PSA.119.63	anyone who obeys your commandments.
PSA.119.64	O 
PSA.119.64	teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.65	You have done many good things for me, 
PSA.119.65	just as you promised.
PSA.119.66	I believe in your commands;
PSA.119.66	now teach me good judgment and knowledge.
PSA.119.67	I used to wander off until you disciplined me;
PSA.119.67	but now I closely follow your word.
PSA.119.68	You are good and do only good;
PSA.119.68	teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.69	Arrogant people smear me with lies,
PSA.119.69	but in truth I obey your commandments with all my heart.
PSA.119.70	Their hearts are dull and stupid,
PSA.119.70	but I delight in your instructions.
PSA.119.71	My suffering was good for me,
PSA.119.71	for it taught me to pay attention to your decrees.
PSA.119.72	Your instructions are more valuable to me
PSA.119.72	than millions in gold and silver.
PSA.119.73	You made me; you created me.
PSA.119.73	Now give me the sense to follow your commands.
PSA.119.74	May all who fear you find in me a cause for joy,
PSA.119.74	for I have put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.75	I know, O 
PSA.119.75	you disciplined me because I needed it.
PSA.119.76	Now let your unfailing love comfort me,
PSA.119.76	just as you promised me, your servant.
PSA.119.77	Surround me with your tender mercies so I may live,
PSA.119.77	for your instructions are my delight.
PSA.119.78	Bring disgrace upon the arrogant people who lied about me;
PSA.119.78	meanwhile, I will concentrate on your commandments.
PSA.119.79	Let me be united with all who fear you,
PSA.119.79	with those who know your laws.
PSA.119.80	May I be blameless in keeping your decrees;
PSA.119.80	then I will never be ashamed.
PSA.119.81	I am worn out waiting for your rescue,
PSA.119.81	but I have put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.82	My eyes are straining to see your promises come true.
PSA.119.82	When will you comfort me?
PSA.119.83	I am shriveled like a wineskin in the smoke,
PSA.119.83	but I have not forgotten to obey your decrees.
PSA.119.84	How long must I wait?
PSA.119.84	When will you punish those who persecute me?
PSA.119.85	These arrogant people who hate your instructions
PSA.119.85	have dug deep pits to trap me.
PSA.119.86	All your commands are trustworthy.
PSA.119.86	Protect me from those who hunt me down without cause.
PSA.119.87	They almost finished me off,
PSA.119.87	but I refused to abandon your commandments.
PSA.119.88	In your unfailing love, spare my life;
PSA.119.88	then I can continue to obey your laws.
PSA.119.89	Your eternal word, O 
PSA.119.89	stands firm in heaven.
PSA.119.90	Your faithfulness extends to every generation,
PSA.119.90	as enduring as the earth you created.
PSA.119.91	Your regulations remain true to this day,
PSA.119.91	for everything serves your plans.
PSA.119.92	If your instructions hadn’t sustained me with joy,
PSA.119.92	I would have died in my misery.
PSA.119.93	I will never forget your commandments,
PSA.119.93	for by them you give me life.
PSA.119.94	I am yours; rescue me!
PSA.119.94	For I have worked hard at obeying your commandments.
PSA.119.95	Though the wicked hide along the way to kill me,
PSA.119.95	I will quietly keep my mind on your laws.
PSA.119.96	Even perfection has its limits,
PSA.119.96	but your commands have no limit.
PSA.119.97	Oh, how I love your instructions!
PSA.119.97	I think about them all day long.
PSA.119.98	Your commands make me wiser than my enemies,
PSA.119.98	for they are my constant guide.
PSA.119.99	Yes, I have more insight than my teachers,
PSA.119.99	for I am always thinking of your laws.
PSA.119.100	I am even wiser than my elders,
PSA.119.100	for I have kept your commandments.
PSA.119.101	I have refused to walk on any evil path,
PSA.119.101	so that I may remain obedient to your word.
PSA.119.102	I haven’t turned away from your regulations,
PSA.119.102	for you have taught me well.
PSA.119.103	How sweet your words taste to me;
PSA.119.103	they are sweeter than honey.
PSA.119.104	Your commandments give me understanding;
PSA.119.104	no wonder I hate every false way of life.
PSA.119.105	Your word is a lamp to guide my feet
PSA.119.105	and a light for my path.
PSA.119.106	I’ve promised it once, and I’ll promise it again:
PSA.119.106	I will obey your righteous regulations.
PSA.119.107	I have suffered much, O 
PSA.119.107	restore my life again as you promised.
PSA.119.108	, accept my offering of praise,
PSA.119.108	and teach me your regulations.
PSA.119.109	My life constantly hangs in the balance,
PSA.119.109	but I will not stop obeying your instructions.
PSA.119.110	The wicked have set their traps for me,
PSA.119.110	but I will not turn from your commandments.
PSA.119.111	Your laws are my treasure;
PSA.119.111	they are my heart’s delight.
PSA.119.112	I am determined to keep your decrees
PSA.119.112	to the very end.
PSA.119.113	I hate those with divided loyalties,
PSA.119.113	but I love your instructions.
PSA.119.114	You are my refuge and my shield;
PSA.119.114	your word is my source of hope.
PSA.119.115	Get out of my life, you evil-minded people,
PSA.119.115	for I intend to obey the commands of my God.
PSA.119.116	, sustain me as you promised, that I may live!
PSA.119.116	Do not let my hope be crushed.
PSA.119.117	Sustain me, and I will be rescued;
PSA.119.117	then I will meditate continually on your decrees.
PSA.119.118	But you have rejected all who stray from your decrees.
PSA.119.118	They are only fooling themselves.
PSA.119.119	You skim off the wicked of the earth like scum;
PSA.119.119	no wonder I love to obey your laws!
PSA.119.120	I tremble in fear of you;
PSA.119.120	I stand in awe of your regulations.
PSA.119.121	Don’t leave me to the mercy of my enemies,
PSA.119.121	for I have done what is just and right.
PSA.119.122	Please guarantee a blessing for me.
PSA.119.122	Don’t let the arrogant oppress me!
PSA.119.123	My eyes strain to see your rescue,
PSA.119.123	to see the truth of your promise fulfilled.
PSA.119.124	I am your servant; deal with me in unfailing love,
PSA.119.124	and teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.125	Give discernment to me, your servant;
PSA.119.125	then I will understand your laws.
PSA.119.126	, it is time for you to act,
PSA.119.126	for these evil people have violated your instructions.
PSA.119.127	Truly, I love your commands
PSA.119.127	more than gold, even the finest gold.
PSA.119.128	Each of your commandments is right.
PSA.119.128	That is why I hate every false way.
PSA.119.129	Your laws are wonderful.
PSA.119.129	No wonder I obey them!
PSA.119.130	The teaching of your word gives light,
PSA.119.130	so even the simple can understand.
PSA.119.131	I pant with expectation,
PSA.119.131	longing for your commands.
PSA.119.132	Come and show me your mercy,
PSA.119.132	as you do for all who love your name.
PSA.119.133	Guide my steps by your word,
PSA.119.133	so I will not be overcome by evil.
PSA.119.134	Ransom me from the oppression of evil people;
PSA.119.134	then I can obey your commandments.
PSA.119.135	Look upon me with love;
PSA.119.135	teach me your decrees.
PSA.119.136	Rivers of tears gush from my eyes
PSA.119.136	because people disobey your instructions.
PSA.119.137	O 
PSA.119.137	and your regulations are fair.
PSA.119.138	Your laws are perfect
PSA.119.138	and completely trustworthy.
PSA.119.139	I am overwhelmed with indignation,
PSA.119.139	for my enemies have disregarded your words.
PSA.119.140	Your promises have been thoroughly tested;
PSA.119.140	that is why I love them so much.
PSA.119.141	I am insignificant and despised,
PSA.119.141	but I don’t forget your commandments.
PSA.119.142	Your justice is eternal,
PSA.119.142	and your instructions are perfectly true.
PSA.119.143	As pressure and stress bear down on me,
PSA.119.143	I find joy in your commands.
PSA.119.144	Your laws are always right;
PSA.119.144	help me to understand them so I may live.
PSA.119.145	I pray with all my heart; answer me, 
PSA.119.145	I will obey your decrees.
PSA.119.146	I cry out to you; rescue me,
PSA.119.146	that I may obey your laws.
PSA.119.147	I rise early, before the sun is up;
PSA.119.147	I cry out for help and put my hope in your words.
PSA.119.148	I stay awake through the night,
PSA.119.148	thinking about your promise.
PSA.119.149	In your faithful love, O 
PSA.119.149	let me be revived by following your regulations.
PSA.119.150	Lawless people are coming to attack me;
PSA.119.150	they live far from your instructions.
PSA.119.151	But you are near, O 
PSA.119.151	and all your commands are true.
PSA.119.152	I have known from my earliest days
PSA.119.152	that your laws will last forever.
PSA.119.153	Look upon my suffering and rescue me,
PSA.119.153	for I have not forgotten your instructions.
PSA.119.154	Argue my case; take my side!
PSA.119.154	Protect my life as you promised.
PSA.119.155	The wicked are far from rescue,
PSA.119.155	for they do not bother with your decrees.
PSA.119.156	, how great is your mercy;
PSA.119.156	let me be revived by following your regulations.
PSA.119.157	Many persecute and trouble me,
PSA.119.157	yet I have not swerved from your laws.
PSA.119.158	Seeing these traitors makes me sick at heart,
PSA.119.158	because they care nothing for your word.
PSA.119.159	See how I love your commandments, 
PSA.119.159	Give back my life because of your unfailing love.
PSA.119.160	The very essence of your words is truth;
PSA.119.160	all your just regulations will stand forever.
PSA.119.161	Powerful people harass me without cause,
PSA.119.161	but my heart trembles only at your word.
PSA.119.162	I rejoice in your word
PSA.119.162	like one who discovers a great treasure.
PSA.119.163	I hate and abhor all falsehood,
PSA.119.163	but I love your instructions.
PSA.119.164	I will praise you seven times a day
PSA.119.164	because all your regulations are just.
PSA.119.165	Those who love your instructions have great peace
PSA.119.165	and do not stumble.
PSA.119.166	I long for your rescue, 
PSA.119.166	so I have obeyed your commands.
PSA.119.167	I have obeyed your laws,
PSA.119.167	for I love them very much.
PSA.119.168	Yes, I obey your commandments and laws
PSA.119.168	because you know everything I do.
PSA.119.169	O 
PSA.119.169	give me the discerning mind you promised.
PSA.119.170	Listen to my prayer;
PSA.119.170	rescue me as you promised.
PSA.119.171	Let praise flow from my lips,
PSA.119.171	for you have taught me your decrees.
PSA.119.172	Let my tongue sing about your word,
PSA.119.172	for all your commands are right.
PSA.119.173	Give me a helping hand,
PSA.119.173	for I have chosen to follow your commandments.
PSA.119.174	O 
PSA.119.174	and your instructions are my delight.
PSA.119.175	Let me live so I can praise you,
PSA.119.175	and may your regulations help me.
PSA.119.176	I have wandered away like a lost sheep;
PSA.119.176	come and find me,
PSA.119.176	for I have not forgotten your commands.
PSA.120.1	I took my troubles to the 
PSA.120.1	I cried out to him, and he answered my prayer.
PSA.120.2	Rescue me, O 
PSA.120.2	and from all deceitful people.
PSA.120.3	O deceptive tongue, what will God do to you?
PSA.120.3	How will he increase your punishment?
PSA.120.4	You will be pierced with sharp arrows
PSA.120.4	and burned with glowing coals.
PSA.120.5	How I suffer in far-off Meshech.
PSA.120.5	It pains me to live in distant Kedar.
PSA.120.6	I am tired of living
PSA.120.6	among people who hate peace.
PSA.120.7	I search for peace;
PSA.120.7	but when I speak of peace, they want war!
PSA.121.1	I look up to the mountains—
PSA.121.1	does my help come from there?
PSA.121.2	My help comes from the 
PSA.121.2	who made heaven and earth!
PSA.121.3	He will not let you stumble;
PSA.121.3	the one who watches over you will not slumber.
PSA.121.4	Indeed, he who watches over Israel
PSA.121.4	never slumbers or sleeps.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.6	The sun will not harm you by day,
PSA.121.6	nor the moon at night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.7	and watches over your life.
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.121.8	both now and forever.
PSA.122.1	I was glad when they said to me,
PSA.122.1	“Let us go to the house of the 
PSA.122.2	And now here we are,
PSA.122.2	standing inside your gates, O Jerusalem.
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem is a well-built city;
PSA.122.3	its seamless walls cannot be breached.
PSA.122.4	All the tribes of Israel—the 
PSA.122.4	make their pilgrimage here.
PSA.122.4	They come to give thanks to the name of the 
PSA.122.4	as the law requires of Israel.
PSA.122.5	Here stand the thrones where judgment is given,
PSA.122.5	the thrones of the dynasty of David.
PSA.122.6	Pray for peace in Jerusalem.
PSA.122.6	May all who love this city prosper.
PSA.122.7	O Jerusalem, may there be peace within your walls
PSA.122.7	and prosperity in your palaces.
PSA.122.8	For the sake of my family and friends, I will say,
PSA.122.8	“May you have peace.”
PSA.122.9	For the sake of the house of the 
PSA.122.9	I will seek what is best for you, O Jerusalem.
PSA.123.1	I lift my eyes to you,
PSA.123.1	O God, enthroned in heaven.
PSA.123.2	We keep looking to the 
PSA.123.2	just as servants keep their eyes on their master,
PSA.123.2	as a slave girl watches her mistress for the slightest signal.
PSA.123.3	Have mercy on us, 
PSA.123.3	for we have had our fill of contempt.
PSA.123.4	We have had more than our fill of the scoffing of the proud
PSA.123.4	and the contempt of the arrogant.
PSA.124.1	What if the 
PSA.124.1	Let all Israel repeat:
PSA.124.2	What if the 
PSA.124.2	when people attacked us?
PSA.124.3	They would have swallowed us alive
PSA.124.3	in their burning anger.
PSA.124.4	The waters would have engulfed us;
PSA.124.4	a torrent would have overwhelmed us.
PSA.124.5	Yes, the raging waters of their fury
PSA.124.5	would have overwhelmed our very lives.
PSA.124.6	Praise the 
PSA.124.6	who did not let their teeth tear us apart!
PSA.124.7	We escaped like a bird from a hunter’s trap.
PSA.124.7	The trap is broken, and we are free!
PSA.124.8	Our help is from the 
PSA.124.8	who made heaven and earth.
PSA.125.1	Those who trust in the 
PSA.125.1	they will not be defeated but will endure forever.
PSA.125.2	Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem,
PSA.125.2	so the 
PSA.125.3	The wicked will not rule the land of the godly,
PSA.125.3	for then the godly might be tempted to do wrong.
PSA.125.4	O 
PSA.125.4	whose hearts are in tune with you.
PSA.125.5	But banish those who turn to crooked ways, O 
PSA.125.5	Take them away with those who do evil.
PSA.125.5	May Israel have peace!
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.1	it was like a dream!
PSA.126.2	We were filled with laughter,
PSA.126.2	and we sang for joy.
PSA.126.2	And the other nations said,
PSA.126.2	“What amazing things the 
PSA.126.3	Yes, the 
PSA.126.3	What joy!
PSA.126.4	Restore our fortunes, 
PSA.126.4	as streams renew the desert.
PSA.126.5	Those who plant in tears
PSA.126.5	will harvest with shouts of joy.
PSA.126.6	They weep as they go to plant their seed,
PSA.126.6	but they sing as they return with the harvest.
PSA.127.1	Unless the 
PSA.127.1	the work of the builders is wasted.
PSA.127.1	Unless the 
PSA.127.1	guarding it with sentries will do no good.
PSA.127.2	It is useless for you to work so hard
PSA.127.2	from early morning until late at night,
PSA.127.2	anxiously working for food to eat;
PSA.127.2	for God gives rest to his loved ones.
PSA.127.3	Children are a gift from the 
PSA.127.3	they are a reward from him.
PSA.127.4	Children born to a young man
PSA.127.4	are like arrows in a warrior’s hands.
PSA.127.5	How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them!
PSA.127.5	He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates.
PSA.128.1	How joyful are those who fear the 
PSA.128.1	all who follow his ways!
PSA.128.2	You will enjoy the fruit of your labor.
PSA.128.2	How joyful and prosperous you will be!
PSA.128.3	Your wife will be like a fruitful grapevine,
PSA.128.3	flourishing within your home.
PSA.128.3	Your children will be like vigorous young olive trees
PSA.128.3	as they sit around your table.
PSA.128.4	That is the 
PSA.128.4	for those who fear him.
PSA.128.5	May the 
PSA.128.5	May you see Jerusalem prosper as long as you live.
PSA.128.6	May you live to enjoy your grandchildren.
PSA.128.6	May Israel have peace!
PSA.129.1	From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me.
PSA.129.1	Let all Israel repeat this:
PSA.129.2	From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me,
PSA.129.2	but they have never defeated me.
PSA.129.3	My back is covered with cuts,
PSA.129.3	as if a farmer had plowed long furrows.
PSA.129.4	But the 
PSA.129.4	he has cut me free from the ropes of the ungodly.
PSA.129.5	May all who hate Jerusalem
PSA.129.5	be turned back in shameful defeat.
PSA.129.6	May they be as useless as grass on a rooftop,
PSA.129.6	turning yellow when only half grown,
PSA.129.7	ignored by the harvester,
PSA.129.7	despised by the binder.
PSA.129.8	And may those who pass by
PSA.129.8	refuse to give them this blessing:
PSA.129.8	“The 
PSA.129.8	we bless you in the 
PSA.130.1	From the depths of despair, O 
PSA.130.1	I call for your help.
PSA.130.2	Hear my cry, O Lord.
PSA.130.2	Pay attention to my prayer.
PSA.130.3	, if you kept a record of our sins,
PSA.130.3	who, O Lord, could ever survive?
PSA.130.4	But you offer forgiveness,
PSA.130.4	that we might learn to fear you.
PSA.130.5	I am counting on the 
PSA.130.5	yes, I am counting on him.
PSA.130.5	I have put my hope in his word.
PSA.130.6	I long for the Lord
PSA.130.6	more than sentries long for the dawn,
PSA.130.6	yes, more than sentries long for the dawn.
PSA.130.7	O Israel, hope in the 
PSA.130.7	for with the 
PSA.130.7	His redemption overflows.
PSA.130.8	He himself will redeem Israel
PSA.130.8	from every kind of sin.
PSA.131.1	, my heart is not proud;
PSA.131.1	my eyes are not haughty.
PSA.131.1	I don’t concern myself with matters too great
PSA.131.1	or too awesome for me to grasp.
PSA.131.2	Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself,
PSA.131.2	like a weaned child who no longer cries for its mother’s milk.
PSA.131.2	Yes, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
PSA.131.3	O Israel, put your hope in the 
PSA.131.3	now and always.
PSA.132.1	, remember David
PSA.132.1	and all that he suffered.
PSA.132.2	He made a solemn promise to the 
PSA.132.2	He vowed to the Mighty One of Israel,
PSA.132.3	“I will not go home;
PSA.132.3	I will not let myself rest.
PSA.132.4	I will not let my eyes sleep
PSA.132.4	nor close my eyelids in slumber
PSA.132.5	until I find a place to build a house for the 
PSA.132.5	a sanctuary for the Mighty One of Israel.”
PSA.132.6	We heard that the Ark was in Ephrathah;
PSA.132.6	then we found it in the distant countryside of Jaar.
PSA.132.7	Let us go to the sanctuary of the 
PSA.132.7	let us worship at the footstool of his throne.
PSA.132.8	Arise, O 
PSA.132.8	along with the Ark, the symbol of your power.
PSA.132.9	May your priests be clothed in godliness;
PSA.132.9	may your loyal servants sing for joy.
PSA.132.10	For the sake of your servant David,
PSA.132.10	do not reject the king you have anointed.
PSA.132.11	The 
PSA.132.11	with a promise he will never take back:
PSA.132.11	“I will place one of your descendants
PSA.132.11	on your throne.
PSA.132.12	If your descendants obey the terms of my covenant
PSA.132.12	and the laws that I teach them,
PSA.132.12	then your royal line
PSA.132.12	will continue forever and ever.”
PSA.132.13	For the 
PSA.132.13	he has desired it for his home.
PSA.132.14	“This is my resting place forever,” he said.
PSA.132.14	“I will live here, for this is the home I desired.
PSA.132.15	I will bless this city and make it prosperous;
PSA.132.15	I will satisfy its poor with food.
PSA.132.16	I will clothe its priests with godliness;
PSA.132.16	its faithful servants will sing for joy.
PSA.132.17	Here I will increase the power of David;
PSA.132.17	my anointed one will be a light for my people.
PSA.132.18	I will clothe his enemies with shame,
PSA.132.18	but he will be a glorious king.”
PSA.133.1	How wonderful and pleasant it is
PSA.133.1	when brothers live together in harmony!
PSA.133.2	For harmony is as precious as the anointing oil
PSA.133.2	that was poured over Aaron’s head,
PSA.133.2	that ran down his beard
PSA.133.2	and onto the border of his robe.
PSA.133.3	Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermon
PSA.133.3	that falls on the mountains of Zion.
PSA.133.3	And there the 
PSA.133.3	even life everlasting.
PSA.134.1	Oh, praise the 
PSA.134.1	you who serve at night in the house of the 
PSA.134.2	Lift your hands toward the sanctuary,
PSA.134.2	and praise the 
PSA.134.3	May the 
PSA.134.3	bless you from Jerusalem.
PSA.135.1	Praise the 
PSA.135.1	Praise the name of the 
PSA.135.1	Praise him, you who serve the 
PSA.135.2	you who serve in the house of the 
PSA.135.2	in the courts of the house of our God.
PSA.135.3	Praise the 
PSA.135.3	celebrate his lovely name with music.
PSA.135.4	For the 
PSA.135.4	Israel for his own special treasure.
PSA.135.5	I know the greatness of the 
PSA.135.5	that our Lord is greater than any other god.
PSA.135.6	The 
PSA.135.6	throughout all heaven and earth,
PSA.135.6	and on the seas and in their depths.
PSA.135.7	He causes the clouds to rise over the whole earth.
PSA.135.7	He sends the lightning with the rain
PSA.135.7	and releases the wind from his storehouses.
PSA.135.8	He destroyed the firstborn in each Egyptian home,
PSA.135.8	both people and animals.
PSA.135.9	He performed miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt
PSA.135.9	against Pharaoh and all his people.
PSA.135.10	He struck down great nations
PSA.135.10	and slaughtered mighty kings—
PSA.135.11	Sihon king of the Amorites,
PSA.135.11	Og king of Bashan,
PSA.135.11	and all the kings of Canaan.
PSA.135.12	He gave their land as an inheritance,
PSA.135.12	a special possession to his people Israel.
PSA.135.13	Your name, O 
PSA.135.13	your fame, O 
PSA.135.14	For the 
PSA.135.14	and have compassion on his servants.
PSA.135.15	The idols of the nations are merely things of silver and gold,
PSA.135.15	shaped by human hands.
PSA.135.16	They have mouths but cannot speak,
PSA.135.16	and eyes but cannot see.
PSA.135.17	They have ears but cannot hear,
PSA.135.17	and mouths but cannot breathe.
PSA.135.18	And those who make idols are just like them,
PSA.135.18	as are all who trust in them.
PSA.135.19	O Israel, praise the 
PSA.135.19	O priests—descendants of Aaron—praise the 
PSA.135.20	O Levites, praise the 
PSA.135.20	All you who fear the 
PSA.135.21	The 
PSA.135.21	for he lives here in Jerusalem.

PSA.141.2	and my upraised hands as an evening offering.
PSA.141.3	Take control of what I say, O 
PSA.141.3	and guard my lips.
PSA.141.4	Don’t let me drift toward evil

PSA.141.5	Don’t let me refuse it.
PSA.141.5	But I pray constantly
PSA.141.5	against the wicked and their deeds.

PSA.142.4	but no one gives me a passing thought!
PSA.142.4	No one will help me;
PSA.142.4	no one cares a bit what happens to me.
PSA.142.5	Then I pray to you, O 
PSA.142.5	I say, “You are my place of refuge.

PRO.1.1	These are the proverbs of Solomon, David’s son, king of Israel.
PRO.1.2	Their purpose is to teach people wisdom and discipline,
PRO.1.2	to help them understand the insights of the wise.
PRO.1.3	Their purpose is to teach people to live disciplined and successful lives,
PRO.1.3	to help them do what is right, just, and fair.
PRO.1.4	These proverbs will give insight to the simple,
PRO.1.4	knowledge and discernment to the young.
PRO.1.5	Let the wise listen to these proverbs and become even wiser.
PRO.1.5	Let those with understanding receive guidance
PRO.1.6	by exploring the meaning in these proverbs and parables,
PRO.1.6	the words of the wise and their riddles.
PRO.1.7	Fear of the 
PRO.1.7	but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
PRO.1.8	My child,
PRO.1.8	Don’t neglect your mother’s instruction.
PRO.1.9	What you learn from them will crown you with grace
PRO.1.9	and be a chain of honor around your neck.
PRO.1.10	My child, if sinners entice you,
PRO.1.10	turn your back on them!
PRO.1.11	They may say, “Come and join us.
PRO.1.11	Let’s hide and kill someone!
PRO.1.11	Just for fun, let’s ambush the innocent!
PRO.1.12	Let’s swallow them alive, like the grave
PRO.1.12	let’s swallow them whole, like those who go down to the pit of death.
PRO.1.13	Think of the great things we’ll get!
PRO.1.13	We’ll fill our houses with all the stuff we take.
PRO.1.14	Come, throw in your lot with us;
PRO.1.14	we’ll all share the loot.”
PRO.1.15	My child, don’t go along with them!
PRO.1.15	Stay far away from their paths.
PRO.1.16	They rush to commit evil deeds.
PRO.1.16	They hurry to commit murder.
PRO.1.17	If a bird sees a trap being set,
PRO.1.17	it knows to stay away.
PRO.1.18	But these people set an ambush for themselves;
PRO.1.18	they are trying to get themselves killed.
PRO.1.19	Such is the fate of all who are greedy for money;
PRO.1.19	it robs them of life.
PRO.1.20	Wisdom shouts in the streets.
PRO.1.20	She cries out in the public square.
PRO.1.21	She calls to the crowds along the main street,
PRO.1.21	to those gathered in front of the city gate:
PRO.1.22	“How long, you simpletons,
PRO.1.22	will you insist on being simpleminded?
PRO.1.22	How long will you mockers relish your mocking?
PRO.1.22	How long will you fools hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	Come and listen to my counsel.
PRO.1.23	I’ll share my heart with you
PRO.1.23	and make you wise.
PRO.1.24	“I called you so often, but you wouldn’t come.
PRO.1.24	I reached out to you, but you paid no attention.
PRO.1.25	You ignored my advice
PRO.1.25	and rejected the correction I offered.
PRO.1.26	So I will laugh when you are in trouble!
PRO.1.26	I will mock you when disaster overtakes you—
PRO.1.27	when calamity overtakes you like a storm,
PRO.1.27	when disaster engulfs you like a cyclone,
PRO.1.27	and anguish and distress overwhelm you.
PRO.1.28	“When they cry for help, I will not answer.
PRO.1.28	Though they anxiously search for me, they will not find me.
PRO.1.29	For they hated knowledge
PRO.1.29	and chose not to fear the 
PRO.1.30	They rejected my advice
PRO.1.30	and paid no attention when I corrected them.
PRO.1.31	Therefore, they must eat the bitter fruit of living their own way,
PRO.1.31	choking on their own schemes.
PRO.1.32	For simpletons turn away from me—to death.
PRO.1.32	Fools are destroyed by their own complacency.
PRO.1.33	But all who listen to me will live in peace,
PRO.1.33	untroubled by fear of harm.”
PRO.2.1	My child,
PRO.2.1	and treasure my commands.
PRO.2.2	Tune your ears to wisdom,
PRO.2.2	and concentrate on understanding.
PRO.2.3	Cry out for insight,
PRO.2.3	and ask for understanding.
PRO.2.4	Search for them as you would for silver;
PRO.2.4	seek them like hidden treasures.
PRO.2.5	Then you will understand what it means to fear the 
PRO.2.5	and you will gain knowledge of God.
PRO.2.6	For the 
PRO.2.6	From his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
PRO.2.7	He grants a treasure of common sense to the honest.
PRO.2.7	He is a shield to those who walk with integrity.
PRO.2.8	He guards the paths of the just
PRO.2.8	and protects those who are faithful to him.
PRO.2.9	Then you will understand what is right, just, and fair,
PRO.2.9	and you will find the right way to go.
PRO.2.10	For wisdom will enter your heart,
PRO.2.10	and knowledge will fill you with joy.
PRO.2.11	Wise choices will watch over you.
PRO.2.11	Understanding will keep you safe.
PRO.2.12	Wisdom will save you from evil people,
PRO.2.12	from those whose words are twisted.
PRO.2.13	These men turn from the right way
PRO.2.13	to walk down dark paths.
PRO.2.14	They take pleasure in doing wrong,
PRO.2.14	and they enjoy the twisted ways of evil.
PRO.2.15	Their actions are crooked,
PRO.2.15	and their ways are wrong.
PRO.2.16	Wisdom will save you from the immoral woman,
PRO.2.16	from the seductive words of the promiscuous woman.
PRO.2.17	She has abandoned her husband
PRO.2.17	and ignores the covenant she made before God.
PRO.2.18	Entering her house leads to death;
PRO.2.18	it is the road to the grave.
PRO.2.19	The man who visits her is doomed.
PRO.2.19	He will never reach the paths of life.
PRO.2.20	So follow the steps of the good,
PRO.2.20	and stay on the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For only the godly will live in the land,
PRO.2.21	and those with integrity will remain in it.
PRO.2.22	But the wicked will be removed from the land,
PRO.2.22	and the treacherous will be uprooted.
PRO.3.1	My child,
PRO.3.1	Store my commands in your heart.
PRO.3.2	If you do this, you will live many years,
PRO.3.2	and your life will be satisfying.
PRO.3.3	Never let loyalty and kindness leave you!
PRO.3.3	Tie them around your neck as a reminder.
PRO.3.3	Write them deep within your heart.
PRO.3.4	Then you will find favor with both God and people,
PRO.3.4	and you will earn a good reputation.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the 
PRO.3.5	do not depend on your own understanding.
PRO.3.6	Seek his will in all you do,
PRO.3.6	and he will show you which path to take.
PRO.3.7	Don’t be impressed with your own wisdom.
PRO.3.7	Instead, fear the 
PRO.3.8	Then you will have healing for your body
PRO.3.8	and strength for your bones.
PRO.3.9	Honor the 
PRO.3.9	and with the best part of everything you produce.
PRO.3.10	Then he will fill your barns with grain,
PRO.3.10	and your vats will overflow with good wine.
PRO.3.11	My child, don’t reject the 
PRO.3.11	and don’t be upset when he corrects you.
PRO.3.12	For the 
PRO.3.12	just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights.
PRO.3.13	Joyful is the person who finds wisdom,
PRO.3.13	the one who gains understanding.
PRO.3.14	For wisdom is more profitable than silver,
PRO.3.14	and her wages are better than gold.
PRO.3.15	Wisdom is more precious than rubies;
PRO.3.15	nothing you desire can compare with her.
PRO.3.16	She offers you long life in her right hand,
PRO.3.16	and riches and honor in her left.
PRO.3.17	She will guide you down delightful paths;
PRO.3.17	all her ways are satisfying.
PRO.3.18	Wisdom is a tree of life to those who embrace her;
PRO.3.18	happy are those who hold her tightly.
PRO.3.19	By wisdom the 
PRO.3.19	by understanding he created the heavens.
PRO.3.20	By his knowledge the deep fountains of the earth burst forth,
PRO.3.20	and the dew settles beneath the night sky.
PRO.3.21	My child, don’t lose sight of common sense and discernment.
PRO.3.21	Hang on to them,
PRO.3.22	for they will refresh your soul.
PRO.3.22	They are like jewels on a necklace.
PRO.3.23	They keep you safe on your way,
PRO.3.23	and your feet will not stumble.
PRO.3.24	You can go to bed without fear;
PRO.3.24	you will lie down and sleep soundly.
PRO.3.25	You need not be afraid of sudden disaster
PRO.3.25	or the destruction that comes upon the wicked,
PRO.3.26	for the 
PRO.3.26	He will keep your foot from being caught in a trap.
PRO.3.27	Do not withhold good from those who deserve it
PRO.3.27	when it’s in your power to help them.
PRO.3.28	If you can help your neighbor now, don’t say,
PRO.3.28	“Come back tomorrow, and then I’ll help you.”
PRO.3.29	Don’t plot harm against your neighbor,
PRO.3.29	for those who live nearby trust you.
PRO.3.30	Don’t pick a fight without reason,
PRO.3.30	when no one has done you harm.
PRO.3.31	Don’t envy violent people
PRO.3.31	or copy their ways.
PRO.3.32	Such wicked people are detestable to the 
PRO.3.32	but he offers his friendship to the godly.
PRO.3.33	The 
PRO.3.33	but he blesses the home of the upright.
PRO.3.34	The 
PRO.3.34	but is gracious to the humble.
PRO.3.35	The wise inherit honor,
PRO.3.35	but fools are put to shame!
PRO.4.1	My children,
PRO.4.1	Pay attention and learn good judgment,
PRO.4.2	for I am giving you good guidance.
PRO.4.2	Don’t turn away from my instructions.
PRO.4.3	For I, too, was once my father’s son,
PRO.4.3	tenderly loved as my mother’s only child.
PRO.4.4	My father taught me,
PRO.4.4	“Take my words to heart.
PRO.4.4	Follow my commands, and you will live.
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom; develop good judgment.
PRO.4.5	Don’t forget my words or turn away from them.
PRO.4.6	Don’t turn your back on wisdom, for she will protect you.
PRO.4.6	Love her, and she will guard you.
PRO.4.7	Getting wisdom is the wisest thing you can do!
PRO.4.7	And whatever else you do, develop good judgment.
PRO.4.8	If you prize wisdom, she will make you great.
PRO.4.8	Embrace her, and she will honor you.
PRO.4.9	She will place a lovely wreath on your head;
PRO.4.9	she will present you with a beautiful crown.”
PRO.4.10	My child,
PRO.4.10	and you will have a long, good life.
PRO.4.11	I will teach you wisdom’s ways
PRO.4.11	and lead you in straight paths.
PRO.4.12	When you walk, you won’t be held back;
PRO.4.12	when you run, you won’t stumble.
PRO.4.13	Take hold of my instructions; don’t let them go.
PRO.4.13	Guard them, for they are the key to life.
PRO.4.14	Don’t do as the wicked do,
PRO.4.14	and don’t follow the path of evildoers.
PRO.4.15	Don’t even think about it; don’t go that way.
PRO.4.15	Turn away and keep moving.
PRO.4.16	For evil people can’t sleep until they’ve done their evil deed for the day.
PRO.4.16	They can’t rest until they’ve caused someone to stumble.
PRO.4.17	They eat the food of wickedness
PRO.4.17	and drink the wine of violence!
PRO.4.18	The way of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn,
PRO.4.18	which shines ever brighter until the full light of day.
PRO.4.19	But the way of the wicked is like total darkness.
PRO.4.19	They have no idea what they are stumbling over.
PRO.4.20	My child, pay attention to what I say.
PRO.4.20	Listen carefully to my words.
PRO.4.21	Don’t lose sight of them.
PRO.4.21	Let them penetrate deep into your heart,
PRO.4.22	for they bring life to those who find them,
PRO.4.22	and healing to their whole body.
PRO.4.23	Guard your heart above all else,
PRO.4.23	for it determines the course of your life.
PRO.4.24	Avoid all perverse talk;
PRO.4.24	stay away from corrupt speech.
PRO.4.25	Look straight ahead,
PRO.4.25	and fix your eyes on what lies before you.
PRO.4.26	Mark out a straight path for your feet;
PRO.4.26	stay on the safe path.
PRO.4.27	Don’t get sidetracked;
PRO.4.27	keep your feet from following evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, pay attention to my wisdom;
PRO.5.1	listen carefully to my wise counsel.
PRO.5.2	Then you will show discernment,
PRO.5.2	and your lips will express what you’ve learned.
PRO.5.3	For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey,
PRO.5.3	and her mouth is smoother than oil.
PRO.5.4	But in the end she is as bitter as poison,
PRO.5.4	as dangerous as a double-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death;
PRO.5.5	her steps lead straight to the grave.
PRO.5.6	For she cares nothing about the path to life.
PRO.5.6	She staggers down a crooked trail and doesn’t realize it.
PRO.5.7	So now, my sons, listen to me.
PRO.5.7	Never stray from what I am about to say:
PRO.5.8	Stay away from her!
PRO.5.8	Don’t go near the door of her house!
PRO.5.9	If you do, you will lose your honor
PRO.5.9	and will lose to merciless people all you have achieved.
PRO.5.10	Strangers will consume your wealth,
PRO.5.10	and someone else will enjoy the fruit of your labor.
PRO.5.11	In the end you will groan in anguish
PRO.5.11	when disease consumes your body.
PRO.5.12	You will say, “How I hated discipline!
PRO.5.12	If only I had not ignored all the warnings!
PRO.5.13	Oh, why didn’t I listen to my teachers?
PRO.5.13	Why didn’t I pay attention to my instructors?
PRO.5.14	I have come to the brink of utter ruin,
PRO.5.14	and now I must face public disgrace.”
PRO.5.15	Drink water from your own well—
PRO.5.15	share your love only with your wife.
PRO.5.16	Why spill the water of your springs in the streets,
PRO.5.16	having sex with just anyone?
PRO.5.17	You should reserve it for yourselves.
PRO.5.17	Never share it with strangers.
PRO.5.18	Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you.
PRO.5.18	Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
PRO.5.19	She is a loving deer, a graceful doe.
PRO.5.19	Let her breasts satisfy you always.
PRO.5.19	May you always be captivated by her love.
PRO.5.20	Why be captivated, my son, by an immoral woman,
PRO.5.20	or fondle the breasts of a promiscuous woman?
PRO.5.21	For the 
PRO.5.21	examining every path he takes.
PRO.5.22	An evil man is held captive by his own sins;
PRO.5.22	they are ropes that catch and hold him.
PRO.5.23	He will die for lack of self-control;
PRO.5.23	he will be lost because of his great foolishness.
PRO.6.1	My child,
PRO.6.1	or agreed to guarantee the debt of a stranger—
PRO.6.2	if you have trapped yourself by your agreement
PRO.6.2	and are caught by what you said—
PRO.6.3	follow my advice and save yourself,
PRO.6.3	for you have placed yourself at your friend’s mercy.
PRO.6.3	Now swallow your pride;
PRO.6.3	go and beg to have your name erased.
PRO.6.4	Don’t put it off; do it now!
PRO.6.4	Don’t rest until you do.
PRO.6.5	Save yourself like a gazelle escaping from a hunter,
PRO.6.5	like a bird fleeing from a net.
PRO.6.6	Take a lesson from the ants, you lazybones.
PRO.6.6	Learn from their ways and become wise!
PRO.6.7	Though they have no prince
PRO.6.7	or governor or ruler to make them work,
PRO.6.8	they labor hard all summer,
PRO.6.8	gathering food for the winter.
PRO.6.9	But you, lazybones, how long will you sleep?
PRO.6.9	When will you wake up?
PRO.6.10	A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,
PRO.6.10	a little folding of the hands to rest—
PRO.6.11	then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit;
PRO.6.11	scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.
PRO.6.12	What are worthless and wicked people like?
PRO.6.12	They are constant liars,
PRO.6.13	signaling their deceit with a wink of the eye,
PRO.6.13	a nudge of the foot, or the wiggle of fingers.
PRO.6.14	Their perverted hearts plot evil,
PRO.6.14	and they constantly stir up trouble.
PRO.6.15	But they will be destroyed suddenly,
PRO.6.15	broken in an instant beyond all hope of healing.
PRO.6.16	There are six things the 
PRO.6.16	no, seven things he detests:
PRO.6.17	haughty eyes,
PRO.6.17	a lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	hands that kill the innocent,
PRO.6.18	a heart that plots evil,
PRO.6.18	feet that race to do wrong,
PRO.6.19	a false witness who pours out lies,
PRO.6.19	a person who sows discord in a family.
PRO.6.20	My son, obey your father’s commands,
PRO.6.20	and don’t neglect your mother’s instruction.
PRO.6.21	Keep their words always in your heart.
PRO.6.21	Tie them around your neck.
PRO.6.22	When you walk, their counsel will lead you.
PRO.6.22	When you sleep, they will protect you.
PRO.6.22	When you wake up, they will advise you.
PRO.6.23	For their command is a lamp
PRO.6.23	and their instruction a light;
PRO.6.23	their corrective discipline
PRO.6.23	is the way to life.
PRO.6.24	It will keep you from the immoral woman,
PRO.6.24	from the smooth tongue of a promiscuous woman.
PRO.6.25	Don’t lust for her beauty.
PRO.6.25	Don’t let her coy glances seduce you.
PRO.6.26	For a prostitute will bring you to poverty,
PRO.6.26	but sleeping with another man’s wife will cost you your life.
PRO.6.27	Can a man scoop a flame into his lap
PRO.6.27	and not have his clothes catch on fire?
PRO.6.28	Can he walk on hot coals
PRO.6.28	and not blister his feet?
PRO.6.29	So it is with the man who sleeps with another man’s wife.
PRO.6.29	He who embraces her will not go unpunished.
PRO.6.30	Excuses might be found for a thief
PRO.6.30	who steals because he is starving.
PRO.6.31	But if he is caught, he must pay back seven times what he stole,
PRO.6.31	even if he has to sell everything in his house.
PRO.6.32	But the man who commits adultery is an utter fool,
PRO.6.32	for he destroys himself.
PRO.6.33	He will be wounded and disgraced.
PRO.6.33	His shame will never be erased.
PRO.6.34	For the woman’s jealous husband will be furious,
PRO.6.34	and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
PRO.6.35	He will accept no compensation,
PRO.6.35	nor be satisfied with a payoff of any size.
PRO.7.1	Follow my advice, my son;
PRO.7.1	always treasure my commands.
PRO.7.2	Obey my commands and live!
PRO.7.2	Guard my instructions as you guard your own eyes.
PRO.7.3	Tie them on your fingers as a reminder.
PRO.7.3	Write them deep within your heart.
PRO.7.4	Love wisdom like a sister;
PRO.7.4	make insight a beloved member of your family.
PRO.7.5	Let them protect you from an affair with an immoral woman,
PRO.7.5	from listening to the flattery of a promiscuous woman.
PRO.7.6	While I was at the window of my house,
PRO.7.6	looking through the curtain,
PRO.7.7	I saw some naive young men,
PRO.7.7	and one in particular who lacked common sense.
PRO.7.8	He was crossing the street near the house of an immoral woman,
PRO.7.8	strolling down the path by her house.
PRO.7.9	It was at twilight, in the evening,
PRO.7.9	as deep darkness fell.
PRO.7.10	The woman approached him,
PRO.7.10	seductively dressed and sly of heart.
PRO.7.11	She was the brash, rebellious type,
PRO.7.11	never content to stay at home.
PRO.7.12	She is often in the streets and markets,
PRO.7.12	soliciting at every corner.
PRO.7.13	She threw her arms around him and kissed him,
PRO.7.13	and with a brazen look she said,
PRO.7.14	“I’ve just made my peace offerings
PRO.7.14	and fulfilled my vows.
PRO.7.15	You’re the one I was looking for!
PRO.7.15	I came out to find you, and here you are!
PRO.7.16	My bed is spread with beautiful blankets,
PRO.7.16	with colored sheets of Egyptian linen.
PRO.7.17	I’ve perfumed my bed
PRO.7.17	with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let’s drink our fill of love until morning.
PRO.7.18	Let’s enjoy each other’s caresses,
PRO.7.19	for my husband is not home.
PRO.7.19	He’s away on a long trip.
PRO.7.20	He has taken a wallet full of money with him
PRO.7.20	and won’t return until later this month.
PRO.7.21	So she seduced him with her pretty speech
PRO.7.21	and enticed him with her flattery.
PRO.7.22	He followed her at once,
PRO.7.22	like an ox going to the slaughter.
PRO.7.22	He was like a stag caught in a trap,
PRO.7.23	awaiting the arrow that would pierce its heart.
PRO.7.23	He was like a bird flying into a snare,
PRO.7.23	little knowing it would cost him his life.
PRO.7.24	So listen to me, my sons,
PRO.7.24	and pay attention to my words.
PRO.7.25	Don’t let your hearts stray away toward her.
PRO.7.25	Don’t wander down her wayward path.
PRO.7.26	For she has been the ruin of many;
PRO.7.26	many men have been her victims.
PRO.7.27	Her house is the road to the grave.
PRO.7.27	Her bedroom is the den of death.
PRO.8.1	Listen as Wisdom calls out!
PRO.8.1	Hear as understanding raises her voice!
PRO.8.2	On the hilltop along the road,
PRO.8.2	she takes her stand at the crossroads.
PRO.8.3	By the gates at the entrance to the town,
PRO.8.3	on the road leading in, she cries aloud,
PRO.8.4	“I call to you, to all of you!
PRO.8.4	I raise my voice to all people.
PRO.8.5	You simple people, use good judgment.
PRO.8.5	You foolish people, show some understanding.
PRO.8.6	Listen to me! For I have important things to tell you.
PRO.8.6	Everything I say is right,
PRO.8.7	for I speak the truth
PRO.8.7	and detest every kind of deception.
PRO.8.8	My advice is wholesome.
PRO.8.8	There is nothing devious or crooked in it.
PRO.8.9	My words are plain to anyone with understanding,
PRO.8.9	clear to those with knowledge.
PRO.8.10	Choose my instruction rather than silver,
PRO.8.10	and knowledge rather than pure gold.
PRO.8.11	For wisdom is far more valuable than rubies.
PRO.8.11	Nothing you desire can compare with it.
PRO.8.12	“I, Wisdom, live together with good judgment.

PRO.16.1	We can make our own plans,
PRO.16.1	but the 
PRO.16.2	People may be pure in their own eyes,
PRO.16.2	but the 
PRO.16.3	Commit your actions to the 
PRO.16.3	and your plans will succeed.
PRO.16.4	The 
PRO.16.4	even the wicked for a day of disaster.
PRO.16.5	The

PRO.16.6	Unfailing love and faithfulness make atonement for sin.
PRO.16.6	By fearing the 
PRO.16.7	When people’s lives please the 
PRO.16.7	even their enemies are at peace with them.
PRO.16.8	Better to have little, with godliness,
PRO.16.8	than to be rich and dishonest.
PRO.16.9	We can make our plans,
PRO.16.9	but the 
PRO.16.10	The king speaks with divine wisdom;
PRO.16.10	he must never judge unfairly.
PRO.16.11	The 
PRO.16.11	he sets the standards for fairness.
PRO.16.12	A king detests wrongdoing,
PRO.16.12	for his rule is built on justice.
PRO.16.13	The king is pleased with words from righteous lips;
PRO.16.13	he loves those who speak honestly.
PRO.16.14	The anger of the king is a deadly threat;
PRO.16.14	the wise will try to appease it.
PRO.16.15	When the king smiles, there is life;
PRO.16.15	his favor refreshes like a spring rain.
PRO.16.16	How much better to get wisdom than gold,
PRO.16.16	and good judgment than silver!
PRO.16.17	The path of the virtuous leads away from evil;
PRO.16.17	whoever follows that path is safe.
PRO.16.18	Pride goes before destruction,
PRO.16.18	and haughtiness before a fall.
PRO.16.19	Better to live humbly with the poor
PRO.16.19	than to share plunder with the proud.
PRO.16.20	Those who listen to instruction will prosper;
PRO.16.20	those who trust the 
PRO.16.21	The wise are known for their understanding,
PRO.16.21	and pleasant words are persuasive.
PRO.16.22	Discretion is a life-giving fountain to those who possess it,
PRO.16.22	but discipline is wasted on fools.
PRO.16.23	From a wise mind comes wise speech;
PRO.16.23	the words of the wise are persuasive.
PRO.16.24	Kind words are like honey—
PRO.16.24	sweet to the soul and healthy for the body.
PRO.16.25	There is a path before each person that seems right,
PRO.16.25	but it ends in death.
PRO.16.26	It is good for workers to have an appetite;
PRO.16.26	an empty stomach drives them on.
PRO.16.27	Scoundrels create trouble;
PRO.16.27	their words are a destructive blaze.
PRO.16.28	A troublemaker plants seeds of strife;
PRO.16.28	gossip separates the best of friends.
PRO.16.29	Violent people mislead their companions,
PRO.16.29	leading them down a harmful path.
PRO.16.30	With narrowed eyes, people plot evil;
PRO.16.30	with a smirk, they plan their mischief.
PRO.16.31	Gray hair is a crown of glory;
PRO.16.31	it is gained by living a godly life.
PRO.16.32	Better to be patient than powerful;
PRO.16.32	better to have self-control than to conquer a city.
PRO.16.33	We may throw the dice,
PRO.16.33	but the 
PRO.17.1	Better a dry crust eaten in peace
PRO.17.1	than a house filled with feasting—and conflict.
PRO.17.2	A wise servant will rule over the master’s disgraceful son
PRO.17.2	and will share the inheritance of the master’s children.
PRO.17.3	Fire tests the purity of silver and gold,
PRO.17.3	but the 
PRO.17.4	Wrongdoers eagerly listen to gossip;
PRO.17.4	liars pay close attention to slander.
PRO.17.5	Those who mock the poor insult their Maker;
PRO.17.5	those who rejoice at the misfortune of others will be punished.
PRO.17.6	Grandchildren are the crowning glory of the aged;
PRO.17.6	parents
PRO.17.7	Eloquent words are not fitting for a fool;
PRO.17.7	even less are lies fitting for a ruler.
PRO.17.8	A bribe is like a lucky charm;
PRO.17.8	whoever gives one will prosper!
PRO.17.9	Love prospers when a fault is forgiven,
PRO.17.9	but dwelling on it separates close friends.
PRO.17.10	A single rebuke does more for a person of understanding
PRO.17.10	than a hundred lashes on the back of a fool.
PRO.17.11	Evil people are eager for rebellion,
PRO.17.11	but they will be severely punished.
PRO.17.12	It is safer to meet a bear robbed of her cubs
PRO.17.12	than to confront a fool caught in foolishness.
PRO.17.13	If you repay good with evil,
PRO.17.13	evil will never leave your house.
PRO.17.14	Starting a quarrel is like opening a floodgate,
PRO.17.14	so stop before a dispute breaks out.
PRO.17.15	Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent—
PRO.17.15	both are detestable to the 
PRO.17.16	It is senseless to pay to educate a fool,
PRO.17.16	since he has no heart for learning.
PRO.17.17	A friend is always loyal,
PRO.17.17	and a brother is born to help in time of need.
PRO.17.18	It’s poor judgment to guarantee another person’s debt
PRO.17.18	or put up security for a friend.
PRO.17.19	Anyone who loves to quarrel loves sin;
PRO.17.19	anyone who trusts in high walls invites disaster.
PRO.17.20	The crooked heart will not prosper;
PRO.17.20	the lying tongue tumbles into trouble.
PRO.17.21	It is painful to be the parent of a fool;
PRO.17.21	there is no joy for the father of a rebel.
PRO.17.22	A cheerful heart is good medicine,
PRO.17.22	but a broken spirit saps a person’s strength.
PRO.17.23	The wicked take secret bribes
PRO.17.23	to pervert the course of justice.
PRO.17.24	Sensible people keep their eyes glued on wisdom,
PRO.17.24	but a fool’s eyes wander to the ends of the earth.
PRO.17.25	Foolish children
PRO.17.25	and bitterness to the one who gave them birth.
PRO.17.26	It is wrong to punish the godly for being good
PRO.17.26	or to flog leaders for being honest.
PRO.17.27	A truly wise person uses few words;
PRO.17.27	a person with understanding is even-tempered.
PRO.17.28	Even fools are thought wise when they keep silent;
PRO.17.28	with their mouths shut, they seem intelligent.
PRO.18.1	Unfriendly people care only about themselves;
PRO.18.1	they lash out at common sense.
PRO.18.2	Fools have no interest in understanding;
PRO.18.2	they only want to air their own opinions.

PRO.18.3	and scandalous behavior brings contempt.
PRO.18.4	Wise words are like deep waters;
PRO.18.4	wisdom flows from the wise like a bubbling brook.
PRO.18.5	It is not right to acquit the guilty
PRO.18.5	or deny justice to the innocent.
PRO.18.6	Fools’ words get them into constant quarrels;
PRO.18.6	they are asking for a beating.
PRO.18.7	The mouths of fools are their ruin;
PRO.18.7	they trap themselves with their lips.
PRO.18.8	Rumors are dainty morsels
PRO.18.8	that sink deep into one’s heart.

PRO.18.11	The rich think of their wealth as a strong defense;
PRO.18.11	they imagine it to be a high wall of safety.
PRO.18.12	Haughtiness goes before destruction;
PRO.18.12	humility precedes honor.
PRO.18.13	Spouting off before listening to the facts
PRO.18.13	is both shameful and foolish.
PRO.18.14	The human spirit can endure a sick body,
PRO.18.14	but who can bear a crushed spirit?
PRO.18.15	Intelligent people are always ready to learn.
PRO.18.15	Their ears are open for knowledge.
PRO.18.16	Giving a gift can open doors;
PRO.18.16	it gives access to important people!

PRO.18.19	An offended friend is harder to win back than a fortified city.
PRO.18.19	Arguments separate friends like a gate locked with bars.
PRO.18.20	Wise words satisfy like a good meal;
PRO.18.20	the right words bring satisfaction.
PRO.18.21	The tongue can bring death or life;
PRO.18.21	those who love to talk will reap the consequences.
PRO.18.22	The man who finds a wife finds a treasure,
PRO.18.22	and he receives favor from the 
PRO.18.23	The poor plead for mercy;
PRO.18.23	the rich answer with insults.
PRO.18.24	There are “friends” who destroy each other,
PRO.18.24	but a real friend sticks closer than a brother.
PRO.19.1	Better to be poor and honest
PRO.19.1	than to be dishonest and a fool.
PRO.19.2	Enthusiasm without knowledge is no good;
PRO.19.2	haste makes mistakes.
PRO.19.3	People ruin their lives by their own foolishness
PRO.19.3	and then are angry at the 
PRO.19.4	Wealth makes many “friends”;
PRO.19.4	poverty drives them all away.
PRO.19.5	A false witness will not go unpunished,
PRO.19.5	nor will a liar escape.
PRO.19.6	Many seek favors from a ruler;
PRO.19.6	everyone is the friend of a person who gives gifts!
PRO.19.7	The relatives of the poor despise them;
PRO.19.7	how much more will their friends avoid them!
PRO.19.7	Though the poor plead with them,
PRO.19.7	their friends are gone.
PRO.19.8	To acquire wisdom is to love yourself;
PRO.19.8	people who cherish understanding will prosper.
PRO.19.9	A false witness will not go unpunished,
PRO.19.9	and a liar will be destroyed.
PRO.19.10	It isn’t right for a fool to live in luxury
PRO.19.10	or for a slave to rule over princes!
PRO.19.11	Sensible people control their temper;
PRO.19.11	they earn respect by overlooking wrongs.
PRO.19.12	The king’s anger is like a lion’s roar,
PRO.19.12	but his favor is like dew on the grass.
PRO.19.13	A foolish child
PRO.19.13	a quarrelsome wife is as annoying as constant dripping.
PRO.19.14	Fathers can give their sons an inheritance of houses and wealth,
PRO.19.14	but only the 
PRO.19.15	Lazy people sleep soundly,
PRO.19.15	but idleness leaves them hungry.
PRO.19.16	Keep the commandments and keep your life;
PRO.19.16	despising them leads to death.
PRO.19.17	If you help the poor, you are lending to the 
PRO.19.17	and he will repay you!
PRO.19.18	Discipline your children while there is hope.
PRO.19.18	Otherwise you will ruin their lives.
PRO.19.19	Hot-tempered people must pay the penalty.
PRO.19.19	If you rescue them once, you will have to do it again.
PRO.19.20	Get all the advice and instruction you can,
PRO.19.20	so you will be wise the rest of your life.

PRO.19.25	if you correct the wise, they will be all the wiser.
PRO.19.26	Children who mistreat their father or chase away their mother
PRO.19.26	are an embarrassment and a public disgrace.
PRO.19.27	If you stop listening to instruction, my child,
PRO.19.27	you will turn your back on knowledge.
PRO.19.28	A corrupt witness makes a mockery of justice;
PRO.19.28	the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil.
PRO.19.29	Punishment is made for mockers,
PRO.19.29	and the backs of fools are made to be beaten.
PRO.20.1	Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls.

PRO.20.7	blessed are their children who follow them.
PRO.20.8	When a king sits in judgment, he weighs all the evidence,
PRO.20.8	distinguishing the bad from the good.

PRO.20.10	the 
PRO.20.11	Even children are known by the way they act,
PRO.20.11	whether their conduct is pure, and whether it is right.

PRO.20.12	both are gifts from the 
PRO.20.13	If you love sleep, you will end in poverty.
PRO.20.13	Keep your eyes open, and there will be plenty to eat!
PRO.20.14	The buyer haggles over the price, saying, “It’s worthless,”
PRO.20.14	then brags about getting a bargain!
PRO.20.15	Wise words are more valuable
PRO.20.15	than much gold and many rubies.
PRO.20.16	Get security from someone who guarantees a stranger’s debt.
PRO.20.16	Get a deposit if he does it for foreigners.
PRO.20.17	Stolen bread tastes sweet,
PRO.20.17	but it turns to gravel in the mouth.
PRO.20.18	Plans succeed through good counsel;
PRO.20.18	don’t go to war without wise advice.
PRO.20.19	A gossip goes around telling secrets,
PRO.20.19	so don’t hang around with chatterers.
PRO.20.20	If you insult your father or mother,
PRO.20.20	your light will be snuffed out in total darkness.
PRO.20.21	An inheritance obtained too early in life
PRO.20.21	is not a blessing in the end.
PRO.20.22	Don’t say, “I will get even for this wrong.”
PRO.20.22	Wait for the 
PRO.20.23	The 
PRO.20.23	he is not pleased by dishonest scales.
PRO.20.24	The 
PRO.20.24	so why try to understand everything along the way?
PRO.20.25	Don’t trap yourself by making a rash promise to God
PRO.20.25	and only later counting the cost.
PRO.20.26	A wise king scatters the wicked like wheat,
PRO.20.26	then runs his threshing wheel over them.
PRO.20.27	The 
PRO.20.27	exposing every hidden motive.
PRO.20.28	Unfailing love and faithfulness protect the king;
PRO.20.28	his throne is made secure through love.
PRO.20.29	The glory of the young is their strength;
PRO.20.29	the gray hair of experience is the splendor of the old.
PRO.20.30	Physical punishment cleanses away evil;
PRO.20.30	such discipline purifies the heart.
PRO.21.1	The king’s heart is like a stream of water directed by the 
PRO.21.1	he guides it wherever he pleases.
PRO.21.2	People may be right in their own eyes,
PRO.21.2	but the 
PRO.21.3	The

PRO.21.4	Haughty eyes, a proud heart,
PRO.21.4	and evil actions are all sin.
PRO.21.5	Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity,
PRO.21.5	but hasty shortcuts lead to poverty.
PRO.21.6	Wealth created by a lying tongue
PRO.21.6	is a vanishing mist and a deadly trap.
PRO.21.7	The violence of the wicked sweeps them away,
PRO.21.7	because they refuse to do what is just.
PRO.21.8	The guilty walk a crooked path;
PRO.21.8	the innocent travel a straight road.
PRO.21.9	It’s better to live alone in the corner of an attic
PRO.21.9	than with a quarrelsome wife in a lovely home.
PRO.21.10	Evil people desire evil;
PRO.21.10	their neighbors get no mercy from them.
PRO.21.11	If you punish a mocker, the simpleminded become wise;
PRO.21.11	if you instruct the wise, they will be all the wiser.
PRO.21.12	The Righteous One
PRO.21.12	he will bring disaster on them.
PRO.21.13	Those who shut their ears to the cries of the poor
PRO.21.13	will be ignored in their own time of need.
PRO.21.14	A secret gift calms anger;
PRO.21.14	a bribe under the table pacifies fury.

PRO.21.18	The wicked are punished in place of the godly,
PRO.21.18	and traitors in place of the honest.
PRO.21.19	It’s better to live alone in the desert
PRO.21.19	than with a quarrelsome, complaining wife.
PRO.21.20	The wise have wealth and luxury,
PRO.21.20	but fools spend whatever they get.
PRO.21.21	Whoever pursues righteousness and unfailing love
PRO.21.21	will find life, righteousness, and honor.
PRO.21.22	The wise conquer the city of the strong
PRO.21.22	and level the fortress in which they trust.
PRO.21.23	Watch your tongue and keep your mouth shut,
PRO.21.23	and you will stay out of trouble.
PRO.21.24	Mockers are proud and haughty;
PRO.21.24	they act with boundless arrogance.
PRO.21.25	Despite their desires, the lazy will come to ruin,
PRO.21.25	for their hands refuse to work.
PRO.21.26	Some people are always greedy for more,
PRO.21.26	but the godly love to give!
PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of an evil person is detestable,
PRO.21.27	especially when it is offered with wrong motives.
PRO.21.28	A false witness will be cut off,
PRO.21.28	but a credible witness will be allowed to speak.
PRO.21.29	The wicked bluff their way through,
PRO.21.29	but the virtuous think before they act.
PRO.21.30	No human wisdom or understanding or plan
PRO.21.30	can stand against the 
PRO.21.31	The horse is prepared for the day of battle,
PRO.21.31	but the victory belongs to the 
PRO.22.1	Choose a good reputation over great riches;
PRO.22.1	being held in high esteem is better than silver or gold.
PRO.22.2	The rich and poor have this in common:
PRO.22.2	The 
PRO.22.3	A prudent person foresees danger and takes precautions.
PRO.22.3	The simpleton goes blindly on and suffers the consequences.
PRO.22.4	True humility and fear of the

PRO.22.5	whoever values life will avoid it.
PRO.22.6	Direct your children onto the right path,
PRO.22.6	and when they are older, they will not leave it.
PRO.22.7	Just as the rich rule the poor,
PRO.22.7	so the borrower is servant to the lender.
PRO.22.8	Those who plant injustice will harvest disaster,
PRO.22.8	and their reign of terror will come to an end.
PRO.22.9	Blessed are those who are generous,
PRO.22.9	because they feed the poor.
PRO.22.10	Throw out the mocker, and fighting goes, too.
PRO.22.10	Quarrels and insults will disappear.
PRO.22.11	Whoever loves a pure heart and gracious speech
PRO.22.11	will have the king as a friend.
PRO.22.12	The 
PRO.22.12	but he ruins the plans of the treacherous.
PRO.22.13	The lazy person claims, “There’s a lion out there!
PRO.22.13	If I go outside, I might be killed!”
PRO.22.14	The mouth of an immoral woman is a dangerous trap;
PRO.22.14	those who make the 
PRO.22.15	A youngster’s heart is filled with foolishness,
PRO.22.15	but physical discipline will drive it far away.
PRO.22.16	A person who gets ahead by oppressing the poor
PRO.22.16	or by showering gifts on the rich will end in poverty.

PRO.22.29	They will serve kings
PRO.22.29	rather than working for ordinary people.
PRO.23.1	While dining with a ruler,
PRO.23.1	pay attention to what is put before you.
PRO.23.2	If you are a big eater,
PRO.23.2	put a knife to your throat;

PRO.23.3	for he might be trying to trick you.
PRO.23.4	Don’t wear yourself out trying to get rich.
PRO.23.4	Be wise enough to know when to quit.

PRO.23.22	and don’t despise your mother when she is old.
PRO.23.23	Get the truth and never sell it;
PRO.23.23	also get wisdom, discipline, and good judgment.
PRO.23.24	The father of godly children has cause for joy.
PRO.23.24	What a pleasure to have children who are wise.
PRO.23.25	So give your father and mother joy!
PRO.23.25	May she who gave you birth be happy.
PRO.23.26	O my son, give me your heart.
PRO.23.26	May your eyes take delight in following my ways.
PRO.23.27	A prostitute is a dangerous trap;
PRO.23.27	a promiscuous woman is as dangerous as falling into a narrow well.
PRO.23.28	She hides and waits like a robber,
PRO.23.28	eager to make more men unfaithful.
PRO.23.29	Who has anguish? Who has sorrow?
PRO.23.29	Who is always fighting? Who is always complaining?
PRO.23.29	Who has unnecessary bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?
PRO.23.30	It is the one who spends long hours in the taverns,
PRO.23.30	trying out new drinks.
PRO.23.31	Don’t gaze at the wine, seeing how red it is,
PRO.23.31	how it sparkles in the cup, how smoothly it goes down.
PRO.23.32	For in the end it bites like a poisonous snake;
PRO.23.32	it stings like a viper.
PRO.23.33	You will see hallucinations,
PRO.23.33	and you will say crazy things.
PRO.23.34	You will stagger like a sailor tossed at sea,
PRO.23.34	clinging to a swaying mast.
PRO.23.35	And you will say, “They hit me, but I didn’t feel it.
PRO.23.35	I didn’t even know it when they beat me up.
PRO.23.35	When will I wake up
PRO.23.35	so I can look for another drink?”
PRO.24.1	Don’t envy evil people
PRO.24.1	or desire their company.
PRO.24.2	For their hearts plot violence,
PRO.24.2	and their words always stir up trouble.
PRO.24.3	A house is built by wisdom
PRO.24.3	and becomes strong through good sense.
PRO.24.4	Through knowledge its rooms are filled
PRO.24.4	with all sorts of precious riches and valuables.
PRO.24.5	The wise are mightier than the strong,
PRO.24.5	and those with knowledge grow stronger and stronger.
PRO.24.6	So don’t go to war without wise guidance;
PRO.24.6	victory depends on having many advisers.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is too lofty for fools.
PRO.24.7	Among leaders at the city gate, they have nothing to say.
PRO.24.8	A person who plans evil
PRO.24.8	will get a reputation as a troublemaker.
PRO.24.9	The schemes of a fool are sinful;
PRO.24.9	everyone detests a mocker.
PRO.24.10	If you fail under pressure,
PRO.24.10	your strength is too small.
PRO.24.11	Rescue those who are unjustly sentenced to die;
PRO.24.11	save them as they stagger to their death.
PRO.24.12	Don’t excuse yourself by saying, “Look, we didn’t know.”
PRO.24.12	For God understands all hearts, and he sees you.
PRO.24.12	He who guards your soul knows you knew.
PRO.24.12	He will repay all people as their actions deserve.
PRO.24.13	My child,
PRO.24.13	and the honeycomb is sweet to the taste.
PRO.24.14	In the same way, wisdom is sweet to your soul.
PRO.24.14	If you find it, you will have a bright future,
PRO.24.14	and your hopes will not be cut short.
PRO.24.15	Don’t wait in ambush at the home of the godly,
PRO.24.15	and don’t raid the house where the godly live.
PRO.24.16	The godly may trip seven times, but they will get up again.
PRO.24.16	But one disaster is enough to overthrow the wicked.
PRO.24.17	Don’t rejoice when your enemies fall;
PRO.24.17	don’t be happy when they stumble.
PRO.24.18	For the 
PRO.24.18	and will turn his anger away from them.
PRO.24.19	Don’t fret because of evildoers;
PRO.24.19	don’t envy the wicked.
PRO.24.20	For evil people have no future;
PRO.24.20	the light of the wicked will be snuffed out.
PRO.24.21	My child, fear the 
PRO.24.21	Don’t associate with rebels,
PRO.24.22	for disaster will hit them suddenly.
PRO.24.22	Who knows what punishment will come
PRO.24.22	from the 
PRO.24.23	Here are some further sayings of the wise:
PRO.24.23	It is wrong to show favoritism when passing judgment.
PRO.24.24	A judge who says to the wicked, “You are innocent,”
PRO.24.24	will be cursed by many people and denounced by the nations.
PRO.24.25	But it will go well for those who convict the guilty;
PRO.24.25	rich blessings will be showered on them.
PRO.24.26	An honest answer
PRO.24.26	is like a kiss of friendship.
PRO.24.27	Do your planning and prepare your fields
PRO.24.27	before building your house.
PRO.24.28	Don’t testify against your neighbors without cause;
PRO.24.28	don’t lie about them.
PRO.24.29	And don’t say, “Now I can pay them back for what they’ve done to me!
PRO.24.29	I’ll get even with them!”
PRO.24.30	I walked by the field of a lazy person,
PRO.24.30	the vineyard of one with no common sense.
PRO.24.31	I saw that it was overgrown with nettles.
PRO.24.31	It was covered with weeds,
PRO.24.31	and its walls were broken down.
PRO.24.32	Then, as I looked and thought about it,
PRO.24.32	I learned this lesson:
PRO.24.33	A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,
PRO.24.33	a little folding of the hands to rest—
PRO.24.34	then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit;
PRO.24.34	scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.
PRO.25.1	These are more proverbs of Solomon, collected by the advisers of King Hezekiah of Judah.
PRO.25.2	It is God’s privilege to conceal things
PRO.25.2	and the king’s privilege to discover them.
PRO.25.3	No one can comprehend the height of heaven, the depth of the earth,
PRO.25.3	or all that goes on in the king’s mind!
PRO.25.4	Remove the impurities from silver,
PRO.25.4	and the sterling will be ready for the silversmith.
PRO.25.5	Remove the wicked from the king’s court,
PRO.25.5	and his reign will be made secure by justice.
PRO.25.6	Don’t demand an audience with the king
PRO.25.6	or push for a place among the great.
PRO.25.7	It’s better to wait for an invitation to the head table
PRO.25.7	than to be sent away in public disgrace.
PRO.25.7	Just because you’ve seen something,
PRO.25.8	don’t be in a hurry to go to court.
PRO.25.8	For what will you do in the end
PRO.25.8	if your neighbor deals you a shameful defeat?
PRO.25.9	When arguing with your neighbor,
PRO.25.9	don’t betray another person’s secret.
PRO.25.10	Others may accuse you of gossip,
PRO.25.10	and you will never regain your good reputation.
PRO.25.11	Timely advice is lovely,
PRO.25.11	like golden apples in a silver basket.
PRO.25.12	To one who listens, valid criticism
PRO.25.12	is like a gold earring or other gold jewelry.
PRO.25.13	Trustworthy messengers refresh like snow in summer.
PRO.25.13	They revive the spirit of their employer.
PRO.25.14	A person who promises a gift but doesn’t give it
PRO.25.14	is like clouds and wind that bring no rain.
PRO.25.15	Patience can persuade a prince,
PRO.25.15	and soft speech can break bones.
PRO.25.16	Do you like honey?
PRO.25.16	Don’t eat too much, or it will make you sick!
PRO.25.17	Don’t visit your neighbors too often,
PRO.25.17	or you will wear out your welcome.
PRO.25.18	Telling lies about others
PRO.25.18	is as harmful as hitting them with an ax,
PRO.25.18	wounding them with a sword,
PRO.25.18	or shooting them with a sharp arrow.
PRO.25.19	Putting confidence in an unreliable person in times of trouble
PRO.25.19	is like chewing with a broken tooth or walking on a lame foot.
PRO.25.20	Singing cheerful songs to a person with a heavy heart
PRO.25.20	is like taking someone’s coat in cold weather
PRO.25.20	or pouring vinegar in a wound.
PRO.25.21	If your enemies are hungry, give them food to eat.
PRO.25.21	If they are thirsty, give them water to drink.
PRO.25.22	You will heap burning coals of shame on their heads,
PRO.25.22	and the 
PRO.25.23	As surely as a north wind brings rain,
PRO.25.23	so a gossiping tongue causes anger!
PRO.25.24	It’s better to live alone in the corner of an attic
PRO.25.24	than with a quarrelsome wife in a lovely home.
PRO.25.25	Good news from far away
PRO.25.25	is like cold water to the thirsty.
PRO.25.26	If the godly give in to the wicked,
PRO.25.26	it’s like polluting a fountain or muddying a spring.
PRO.25.27	It’s not good to eat too much honey,
PRO.25.27	and it’s not good to seek honors for yourself.
PRO.25.28	A person without self-control
PRO.25.28	is like a city with broken-down walls.
PRO.26.1	Honor is no more associated with fools
PRO.26.1	than snow with summer or rain with harvest.
PRO.26.2	Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow,
PRO.26.2	an undeserved curse will not land on its intended victim.
PRO.26.3	Guide a horse with a whip, a donkey with a bridle,
PRO.26.3	and a fool with a rod to his back!
PRO.26.4	Don’t answer the foolish arguments of fools,
PRO.26.4	or you will become as foolish as they are.
PRO.26.5	Be sure to answer the foolish arguments of fools,
PRO.26.5	or they will become wise in their own estimation.
PRO.26.6	Trusting a fool to convey a message
PRO.26.6	is like cutting off one’s feet or drinking poison!
PRO.26.7	A proverb in the mouth of a fool
PRO.26.7	is as useless as a paralyzed leg.
PRO.26.8	Honoring a fool
PRO.26.8	is as foolish as tying a stone to a slingshot.
PRO.26.9	A proverb in the mouth of a fool
PRO.26.9	is like a thorny branch brandished by a drunk.
PRO.26.10	An employer who hires a fool or a bystander
PRO.26.10	is like an archer who shoots at random.
PRO.26.11	As a dog returns to its vomit,
PRO.26.11	so a fool repeats his foolishness.
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for fools
PRO.26.12	than for people who think they are wise.
PRO.26.13	The lazy person claims, “There’s a lion on the road!
PRO.26.13	Yes, I’m sure there’s a lion out there!”
PRO.26.14	As a door swings back and forth on its hinges,
PRO.26.14	so the lazy person turns over in bed.
PRO.26.15	Lazy people take food in their hand
PRO.26.15	but don’t even lift it to their mouth.
PRO.26.16	Lazy people consider themselves smarter
PRO.26.16	than seven wise counselors.
PRO.26.17	Interfering in someone else’s argument
PRO.26.17	is as foolish as yanking a dog’s ears.
PRO.26.18	Just as damaging
PRO.26.18	as a madman shooting a deadly weapon
PRO.26.19	is someone who lies to a friend
PRO.26.19	and then says, “I was only joking.”
PRO.26.20	Fire goes out without wood,
PRO.26.20	and quarrels disappear when gossip stops.
PRO.26.21	A quarrelsome person starts fights
PRO.26.21	as easily as hot embers light charcoal or fire lights wood.
PRO.26.22	Rumors are dainty morsels
PRO.26.22	that sink deep into one’s heart.
PRO.26.23	Smooth
PRO.26.23	just as a pretty glaze covers a clay pot.
PRO.26.24	People may cover their hatred with pleasant words,
PRO.26.24	but they’re deceiving you.
PRO.26.25	They pretend to be kind, but don’t believe them.
PRO.26.25	Their hearts are full of many evils.
PRO.26.26	While their hatred may be concealed by trickery,
PRO.26.26	their wrongdoing will be exposed in public.
PRO.26.27	If you set a trap for others,
PRO.26.27	you will get caught in it yourself.
PRO.26.27	If you roll a boulder down on others,
PRO.26.27	it will crush you instead.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hates its victims,
PRO.26.28	and flattering words cause ruin.
PRO.27.1	Don’t brag about tomorrow,
PRO.27.1	since you don’t know what the day will bring.
PRO.27.2	Let someone else praise you, not your own mouth—
PRO.27.2	a stranger, not your own lips.
PRO.27.3	A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,
PRO.27.3	but the resentment caused by a fool is even heavier.
PRO.27.4	Anger is cruel, and wrath is like a flood,
PRO.27.4	but jealousy is even more dangerous.
PRO.27.5	An open rebuke
PRO.27.5	is better than hidden love!
PRO.27.6	Wounds from a sincere friend
PRO.27.6	are better than many kisses from an enemy.
PRO.27.7	A person who is full refuses honey,
PRO.27.7	but even bitter food tastes sweet to the hungry.
PRO.27.8	A person who strays from home
PRO.27.8	is like a bird that strays from its nest.
PRO.27.9	The heartfelt counsel of a friend
PRO.27.9	is as sweet as perfume and incense.
PRO.27.10	Never abandon a friend—
PRO.27.10	either yours or your father’s.
PRO.27.10	When disaster strikes, you won’t have to ask your brother for assistance.
PRO.27.10	It’s better to go to a neighbor than to a brother who lives far away.
PRO.27.11	Be wise, my child,
PRO.27.11	Then I will be able to answer my critics.
PRO.27.12	A prudent person foresees danger and takes precautions.
PRO.27.12	The simpleton goes blindly on and suffers the consequences.
PRO.27.13	Get security from someone who guarantees a stranger’s debt.
PRO.27.13	Get a deposit if he does it for foreigners.
PRO.27.14	A loud and cheerful greeting early in the morning
PRO.27.14	will be taken as a curse!
PRO.27.15	A quarrelsome wife is as annoying
PRO.27.15	as constant dripping on a rainy day.
PRO.27.16	Stopping her complaints is like trying to stop the wind
PRO.27.16	or trying to hold something with greased hands.
PRO.27.17	As iron sharpens iron,
PRO.27.17	so a friend sharpens a friend.
PRO.27.18	As workers who tend a fig tree are allowed to eat the fruit,
PRO.27.18	so workers who protect their employer’s interests will be rewarded.
PRO.27.19	As a face is reflected in water,
PRO.27.19	so the heart reflects the real person.
PRO.27.20	Just as Death and Destruction
PRO.27.20	so human desire is never satisfied.
PRO.27.21	Fire tests the purity of silver and gold,
PRO.27.21	but a person is tested by being praised.
PRO.27.22	You cannot separate fools from their foolishness,
PRO.27.22	even though you grind them like grain with mortar and pestle.
PRO.27.23	Know the state of your flocks,
PRO.27.23	and put your heart into caring for your herds,
PRO.27.24	for riches don’t last forever,
PRO.27.24	and the crown might not be passed to the next generation.
PRO.27.25	After the hay is harvested and the new crop appears
PRO.27.25	and the mountain grasses are gathered in,
PRO.27.26	your sheep will provide wool for clothing,
PRO.27.26	and your goats will provide the price of a field.
PRO.27.27	And you will have enough goats’ milk for yourself,
PRO.27.27	your family, and your servant girls.
PRO.28.1	The wicked run away when no one is chasing them,
PRO.28.1	but the godly are as bold as lions.
PRO.28.2	When there is moral rot within a nation, its government topples easily.
PRO.28.2	But wise and knowledgeable leaders bring stability.
PRO.28.3	A poor person who oppresses the poor
PRO.28.3	is like a pounding rain that destroys the crops.
PRO.28.4	To reject the law is to praise the wicked;
PRO.28.4	to obey the law is to fight them.
PRO.28.5	Evil people don’t understand justice,
PRO.28.5	but those who follow the 
PRO.28.6	Better to be poor and honest
PRO.28.6	than to be dishonest and rich.
PRO.28.7	Young people who obey the law are wise;
PRO.28.7	those with wild friends bring shame to their parents.
PRO.28.8	Income from charging high interest rates
PRO.28.8	will end up in the pocket of someone who is kind to the poor.
PRO.28.9	God detests the prayers
PRO.28.9	of a person who ignores the law.
PRO.28.10	Those who lead good people along an evil path
PRO.28.10	will fall into their own trap,
PRO.28.10	but the honest will inherit good things.
PRO.28.11	Rich people may think they are wise,
PRO.28.11	but a poor person with discernment can see right through them.
PRO.28.12	When the godly succeed, everyone is glad.
PRO.28.12	When the wicked take charge, people go into hiding.
PRO.28.13	People who conceal their sins will not prosper,
PRO.28.13	but if they confess and turn from them, they will receive mercy.
PRO.28.14	Blessed are those who fear to do wrong,
PRO.28.14	but the stubborn are headed for serious trouble.
PRO.28.15	A wicked ruler is as dangerous to the poor
PRO.28.15	as a roaring lion or an attacking bear.
PRO.28.16	A ruler with no understanding will oppress his people,
PRO.28.16	but one who hates corruption will have a long life.
PRO.28.17	A murderer’s tormented conscience will drive him into the grave.
PRO.28.17	Don’t protect him!
PRO.28.18	The blameless will be rescued from harm,
PRO.28.18	but the crooked will be suddenly destroyed.
PRO.28.19	A hard worker has plenty of food,
PRO.28.19	but a person who chases fantasies ends up in poverty.
PRO.28.20	The trustworthy person will get a rich reward,
PRO.28.20	but a person who wants quick riches will get into trouble.
PRO.28.21	Showing partiality is never good,
PRO.28.21	yet some will do wrong for a mere piece of bread.
PRO.28.22	Greedy people try to get rich quick
PRO.28.22	but don’t realize they’re headed for poverty.
PRO.28.23	In the end, people appreciate honest criticism
PRO.28.23	far more than flattery.
PRO.28.24	Anyone who steals from his father and mother
PRO.28.24	and says, “What’s wrong with that?”
PRO.28.24	is no better than a murderer.
PRO.28.25	Greed causes fighting;
PRO.28.25	trusting the 
PRO.28.26	Those who trust their own insight are foolish,
PRO.28.26	but anyone who walks in wisdom is safe.
PRO.28.27	Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing,
PRO.28.27	but those who close their eyes to poverty will be cursed.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked take charge, people go into hiding.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked meet disaster, the godly flourish.
PRO.29.1	Whoever stubbornly refuses to accept criticism
PRO.29.1	will suddenly be destroyed beyond recovery.
PRO.29.2	When the godly are in authority, the people rejoice.
PRO.29.2	But when the wicked are in power, they groan.
PRO.29.3	The man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father,
PRO.29.3	but if he hangs around with prostitutes, his wealth is wasted.
PRO.29.4	A just king gives stability to his nation,
PRO.29.4	but one who demands bribes destroys it.
PRO.29.5	To flatter friends
PRO.29.5	is to lay a trap for their feet.
PRO.29.6	Evil people are trapped by sin,
PRO.29.6	but the righteous escape, shouting for joy.
PRO.29.7	The godly care about the rights of the poor;
PRO.29.7	the wicked don’t care at all.
PRO.29.8	Mockers can get a whole town agitated,
PRO.29.8	but the wise will calm anger.
PRO.29.9	If a wise person takes a fool to court,
PRO.29.9	there will be ranting and ridicule but no satisfaction.
PRO.29.10	The bloodthirsty hate blameless people,
PRO.29.10	but the upright seek to help them.
PRO.29.11	Fools vent their anger,
PRO.29.11	but the wise quietly hold it back.
PRO.29.12	If a ruler pays attention to liars,
PRO.29.12	all his advisers will be wicked.
PRO.29.13	The poor and the oppressor have this in common—
PRO.29.13	the 
PRO.29.14	If a king judges the poor fairly,
PRO.29.14	his throne will last forever.
PRO.29.15	To discipline a child produces wisdom,
PRO.29.15	but a mother is disgraced by an undisciplined child.
PRO.29.16	When the wicked are in authority, sin flourishes,
PRO.29.16	but the godly will live to see their downfall.
PRO.29.17	Discipline your children, and they will give you peace of mind
PRO.29.17	and will make your heart glad.
PRO.29.18	When people do not accept divine guidance, they run wild.
PRO.29.18	But whoever obeys the law is joyful.
PRO.29.19	Words alone will not discipline a servant;
PRO.29.19	the words may be understood, but they are not heeded.
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a fool
PRO.29.20	than for someone who speaks without thinking.
PRO.29.21	A servant pampered from childhood
PRO.29.21	will become a rebel.
PRO.29.22	An angry person starts fights;
PRO.29.22	a hot-tempered person commits all kinds of sin.
PRO.29.23	Pride ends in humiliation,
PRO.29.23	while humility brings honor.
PRO.29.24	If you assist a thief, you only hurt yourself.
PRO.29.24	You are sworn to tell the truth, but you dare not testify.
PRO.29.25	Fearing people is a dangerous trap,
PRO.29.25	but trusting the 
PRO.29.26	Many seek the ruler’s favor,
PRO.29.26	but justice comes from the 
PRO.29.27	The righteous despise the unjust;
PRO.29.27	the wicked despise the godly.
PRO.30.1	The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh contain this message.
PRO.30.1	I am weary, O God;
PRO.30.1	I am weary and worn out, O God.
PRO.30.2	I am too stupid to be human,
PRO.30.2	and I lack common sense.
PRO.30.3	I have not mastered human wisdom,
PRO.30.3	nor do I know the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	Who but God goes up to heaven and comes back down?
PRO.30.4	Who holds the wind in his fists?
PRO.30.4	Who wraps up the oceans in his cloak?
PRO.30.4	Who has created the whole wide world?
PRO.30.4	What is his name—and his son’s name?
PRO.30.4	Tell me if you know!
PRO.30.5	Every word of God proves true.
PRO.30.5	He is a shield to all who come to him for protection.
PRO.30.6	Do not add to his words,
PRO.30.6	or he may rebuke you and expose you as a liar.
PRO.30.7	O God, I beg two favors from you;
PRO.30.7	let me have them before I die.
PRO.30.8	First, help me never to tell a lie.
PRO.30.8	Second, give me neither poverty nor riches!
PRO.30.8	Give me just enough to satisfy my needs.
PRO.30.9	For if I grow rich, I may deny you and say, “Who is the 
PRO.30.9	And if I am too poor, I may steal and thus insult God’s holy name.
PRO.30.10	Never slander a worker to the employer,
PRO.30.10	or the person will curse you, and you will pay for it.
PRO.30.11	Some people curse their father
PRO.30.11	and do not thank their mother.
PRO.30.12	They are pure in their own eyes,
PRO.30.12	but they are filthy and unwashed.
PRO.30.13	They look proudly around,
PRO.30.13	casting disdainful glances.
PRO.30.14	They have teeth like swords
PRO.30.14	and fangs like knives.
PRO.30.14	They devour the poor from the earth
PRO.30.14	and the needy from among humanity.
PRO.30.15	The leech has two suckers
PRO.30.15	that cry out, “More, more!”
PRO.30.15	There are three things that are never satisfied—
PRO.30.15	no, four that never say, “Enough!”:
PRO.30.16	the grave,
PRO.30.16	the barren womb,
PRO.30.16	the thirsty desert,
PRO.30.16	the blazing fire.
PRO.30.17	The eye that mocks a father
PRO.30.17	and despises a mother’s instructions
PRO.30.17	will be plucked out by ravens of the valley
PRO.30.17	and eaten by vultures.
PRO.30.18	There are three things that amaze me—
PRO.30.18	no, four things that I don’t understand:
PRO.30.19	how an eagle glides through the sky,
PRO.30.19	how a snake slithers on a rock,
PRO.30.19	how a ship navigates the ocean,
PRO.30.19	how a man loves a woman.
PRO.30.20	An adulterous woman consumes a man,
PRO.30.20	then wipes her mouth and says, “What’s wrong with that?”
PRO.30.21	There are three things that make the earth tremble—
PRO.30.21	no, four it cannot endure:
PRO.30.22	a slave who becomes a king,
PRO.30.22	an overbearing fool who prospers,
PRO.30.23	a bitter woman who finally gets a husband,
PRO.30.23	a servant girl who supplants her mistress.
PRO.30.24	There are four things on earth that are small but unusually wise:
PRO.30.25	Ants—they aren’t strong,
PRO.30.25	but they store up food all summer.
PRO.30.26	Hyraxes
PRO.30.26	but they make their homes among the rocks.
PRO.30.27	Locusts—they have no king,
PRO.30.27	but they march in formation.
PRO.30.28	Lizards—they are easy to catch,
PRO.30.28	but they are found even in kings’ palaces.
PRO.30.29	There are three things that walk with stately stride—
PRO.30.29	no, four that strut about:
PRO.30.30	the lion, king of animals, who won’t turn aside for anything,
PRO.30.31	the strutting rooster,
PRO.30.31	the male goat,
PRO.30.31	a king as he leads his army.
PRO.30.32	If you have been a fool by being proud or plotting evil,
PRO.30.32	cover your mouth in shame.
PRO.30.33	As the beating of cream yields butter
PRO.30.33	and striking the nose causes bleeding,
PRO.30.33	so stirring up anger causes quarrels.
PRO.31.1	The sayings of King Lemuel contain this message,
PRO.31.2	O my son, O son of my womb,
PRO.31.2	O son of my vows,
PRO.31.3	do not waste your strength on women,
PRO.31.3	on those who ruin kings.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, O Lemuel, to guzzle wine.
PRO.31.4	Rulers should not crave alcohol.
PRO.31.5	For if they drink, they may forget the law
PRO.31.5	and not give justice to the oppressed.
PRO.31.6	Alcohol is for the dying,
PRO.31.6	and wine for those in bitter distress.
PRO.31.7	Let them drink to forget their poverty
PRO.31.7	and remember their troubles no more.
PRO.31.8	Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves;
PRO.31.8	ensure justice for those being crushed.
PRO.31.9	Yes, speak up for the poor and helpless,
PRO.31.9	and see that they get justice.
PRO.31.10	Who can find a virtuous and capable wife?
PRO.31.10	She is more precious than rubies.
PRO.31.11	Her husband can trust her,
PRO.31.11	and she will greatly enrich his life.
PRO.31.12	She brings him good, not harm,
PRO.31.12	all the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She finds wool and flax
PRO.31.13	and busily spins it.
PRO.31.14	She is like a merchant’s ship,
PRO.31.14	bringing her food from afar.
PRO.31.15	She gets up before dawn to prepare breakfast for her household
PRO.31.15	and plan the day’s work for her servant girls.
PRO.31.16	She goes to inspect a field and buys it;
PRO.31.16	with her earnings she plants a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She is energetic and strong,
PRO.31.17	a hard worker.
PRO.31.18	She makes sure her dealings are profitable;
PRO.31.18	her lamp burns late into the night.
PRO.31.19	Her hands are busy spinning thread,
PRO.31.19	her fingers twisting fiber.
PRO.31.20	She extends a helping hand to the poor
PRO.31.20	and opens her arms to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She has no fear of winter for her household,
PRO.31.21	for everyone has warm
PRO.31.22	She makes her own bedspreads.
PRO.31.22	She dresses in fine linen and purple gowns.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is well known at the city gates,
PRO.31.23	where he sits with the other civic leaders.
PRO.31.24	She makes belted linen garments
PRO.31.24	and sashes to sell to the merchants.
PRO.31.25	She is clothed with strength and dignity,
PRO.31.25	and she laughs without fear of the future.
PRO.31.26	When she speaks, her words are wise,
PRO.31.26	and she gives instructions with kindness.
PRO.31.27	She carefully watches everything in her household
PRO.31.27	and suffers nothing from laziness.
PRO.31.28	Her children stand and bless her.
PRO.31.28	Her husband praises her:
PRO.31.29	“There are many virtuous and capable women in the world,
PRO.31.29	but you surpass them all!”
PRO.31.30	Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last;
PRO.31.30	but a woman who fears the 
PRO.31.31	Reward her for all she has done.
PRO.31.31	Let her deeds publicly declare her praise.
ECC.1.1	These are the words of the Teacher,
ECC.1.2	“Everything is meaningless,” says the Teacher, “completely meaningless!”
ECC.1.3	What do people get for all their hard work under the sun? 
ECC.1.4	Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes. 
ECC.1.5	The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again. 
ECC.1.6	The wind blows south, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles. 
ECC.1.7	Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea. 
ECC.1.8	Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content.
ECC.1.9	History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new. 
ECC.1.10	Sometimes people say, “Here is something new!” But actually it is old; nothing is ever truly new. 
ECC.1.11	We don’t remember what happened in the past, and in future generations, no one will remember what we are doing now.
ECC.1.12	I, the Teacher, was king of Israel, and I lived in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	I devoted myself to search for understanding and to explore by wisdom everything being done under heaven. I soon discovered that God has dealt a tragic existence to the human race. 
ECC.1.14	I observed everything going on under the sun, and really, it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind.
ECC.1.15	What is wrong cannot be made right.
ECC.1.15	What is missing cannot be recovered.
ECC.1.16	I said to myself, “Look, I am wiser than any of the kings who ruled in Jerusalem before me. I have greater wisdom and knowledge than any of them.” 
ECC.1.17	So I set out to learn everything from wisdom to madness and folly. But I learned firsthand that pursuing all this is like chasing the wind.
ECC.1.18	The greater my wisdom, the greater my grief.
ECC.1.18	To increase knowledge only increases sorrow.
ECC.2.1	I said to myself, “Come on, let’s try pleasure. Let’s look for the ‘good things’ in life.” But I found that this, too, was meaningless. 
ECC.2.2	So I said, “Laughter is silly. What good does it do to seek pleasure?” 
ECC.2.3	After much thought, I decided to cheer myself with wine. And while still seeking wisdom, I clutched at foolishness. In this way, I tried to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world.
ECC.2.4	I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards. 
ECC.2.5	I made gardens and parks, filling them with all kinds of fruit trees. 
ECC.2.6	I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves. 
ECC.2.7	I bought slaves, both men and women, and others were born into my household. I also owned large herds and flocks, more than any of the kings who had lived in Jerusalem before me. 
ECC.2.8	I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces. I hired wonderful singers, both men and women, and had many beautiful concubines. I had everything a man could desire!
ECC.2.9	So I became greater than all who had lived in Jerusalem before me, and my wisdom never failed me. 
ECC.2.10	Anything I wanted, I would take. I denied myself no pleasure. I even found great pleasure in hard work, a reward for all my labors. 
ECC.2.11	But as I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish, it was all so meaningless—like chasing the wind. There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere.
ECC.2.12	So I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and madness (for who can do this better than I, the king?
ECC.2.13	I thought, “Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness. 
ECC.2.14	For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark.” Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate. 
ECC.2.15	Both will die. So I said to myself, “Since I will end up the same as the fool, what’s the value of all my wisdom? This is all so meaningless!” 
ECC.2.16	For the wise and the foolish both die. The wise will not be remembered any longer than the fool. In the days to come, both will be forgotten.
ECC.2.17	So I came to hate life because everything done here under the sun is so troubling. Everything is meaningless—like chasing the wind.
ECC.2.18	I came to hate all my hard work here on earth, for I must leave to others everything I have earned. 
ECC.2.19	And who can tell whether my successors will be wise or foolish? Yet they will control everything I have gained by my skill and hard work under the sun. How meaningless! 
ECC.2.20	So I gave up in despair, questioning the value of all my hard work in this world.
ECC.2.21	Some people work wisely with knowledge and skill, then must leave the fruit of their efforts to someone who hasn’t worked for it. This, too, is meaningless, a great tragedy. 
ECC.2.22	So what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety? 
ECC.2.23	Their days of labor are filled with pain and grief; even at night their minds cannot rest. It is all meaningless.
ECC.2.24	So I decided there is nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work. Then I realized that these pleasures are from the hand of God. 
ECC.2.25	For who can eat or enjoy anything apart from him?
ECC.2.26	God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to those who please him. But if a sinner becomes wealthy, God takes the wealth away and gives it to those who please him. This, too, is meaningless—like chasing the wind.
ECC.3.1	For everything there is a season,
ECC.3.1	a time for every activity under heaven.
ECC.3.2	A time to be born and a time to die.
ECC.3.2	A time to plant and a time to harvest.
ECC.3.3	A time to kill and a time to heal.
ECC.3.3	A time to tear down and a time to build up.
ECC.3.4	A time to cry and a time to laugh.
ECC.3.4	A time to grieve and a time to dance.
ECC.3.5	A time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones.
ECC.3.5	A time to embrace and a time to turn away.
ECC.3.6	A time to search and a time to quit searching.
ECC.3.6	A time to keep and a time to throw away.
ECC.3.7	A time to tear and a time to mend.
ECC.3.7	A time to be quiet and a time to speak.
ECC.3.8	A time to love and a time to hate.
ECC.3.8	A time for war and a time for peace.
ECC.3.9	What do people really get for all their hard work? 
ECC.3.10	I have seen the burden God has placed on us all. 
ECC.3.11	Yet God has made everything beautiful for its own time. He has planted eternity in the human heart, but even so, people cannot see the whole scope of God’s work from beginning to end. 
ECC.3.12	So I concluded there is nothing better than to be happy and enjoy ourselves as long as we can. 
ECC.3.13	And people should eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of their labor, for these are gifts from God.
ECC.3.14	And I know that whatever God does is final. Nothing can be added to it or taken from it. God’s purpose is that people should fear him. 
ECC.3.15	What is happening now has happened before, and what will happen in the future has happened before, because God makes the same things happen over and over again.
ECC.3.16	I also noticed that under the sun there is evil in the courtroom. Yes, even the courts of law are corrupt! 
ECC.3.17	I said to myself, “In due season God will judge everyone, both good and bad, for all their deeds.”
ECC.3.18	I also thought about the human condition—how God proves to people that they are like animals. 
ECC.3.19	For people and animals share the same fate—both breathe
ECC.3.20	Both go to the same place—they came from dust and they return to dust. 
ECC.3.21	For who can prove that the human spirit goes up and the spirit of animals goes down into the earth? 
ECC.3.22	So I saw that there is nothing better for people than to be happy in their work. That is our lot in life. And no one can bring us back to see what happens after we die.
ECC.4.1	Again, I observed all the oppression that takes place under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, with no one to comfort them. The oppressors have great power, and their victims are helpless. 
ECC.4.2	So I concluded that the dead are better off than the living. 
ECC.4.3	But most fortunate of all are those who are not yet born. For they have not seen all the evil that is done under the sun.
ECC.4.4	Then I observed that most people are motivated to success because they envy their neighbors. But this, too, is meaningless—like chasing the wind.
ECC.4.5	“Fools fold their idle hands,
ECC.4.5	leading them to ruin.”
ECC.4.6	And yet,
ECC.4.6	“Better to have one handful with quietness
ECC.4.6	than two handfuls with hard work
ECC.4.6	and chasing the wind.”
ECC.4.7	I observed yet another example of something meaningless under the sun. 
ECC.4.8	This is the case of a man who is all alone, without a child or a brother, yet who works hard to gain as much wealth as he can. But then he asks himself, “Who am I working for? Why am I giving up so much pleasure now?” It is all so meaningless and depressing.
ECC.4.9	Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. 
ECC.4.10	If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble. 
ECC.4.11	Likewise, two people lying close together can keep each other warm. But how can one be warm alone? 
ECC.4.12	A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.
ECC.4.13	It is better to be a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who refuses all advice. 
ECC.4.14	Such a youth could rise from poverty and succeed. He might even become king, though he has been in prison. 
ECC.4.15	But then everyone rushes to the side of yet another youth
ECC.4.16	Endless crowds stand around him,
ECC.5.1	As you enter the house of God, keep your ears open and your mouth shut. It is evil to make mindless offerings to God. 
ECC.5.2	Don’t make rash promises, and don’t be hasty in bringing matters before God. After all, God is in heaven, and you are here on earth. So let your words be few.
ECC.5.3	Too much activity gives you restless dreams; too many words make you a fool.
ECC.5.4	When you make a promise to God, don’t delay in following through, for God takes no pleasure in fools. Keep all the promises you make to him. 
ECC.5.5	It is better to say nothing than to make a promise and not keep it. 
ECC.5.6	Don’t let your mouth make you sin. And don’t defend yourself by telling the Temple messenger that the promise you made was a mistake. That would make God angry, and he might wipe out everything you have achieved.
ECC.5.7	Talk is cheap, like daydreams and other useless activities. Fear God instead.
ECC.5.8	Don’t be surprised if you see a poor person being oppressed by the powerful and if justice is being miscarried throughout the land. For every official is under orders from higher up, and matters of justice get lost in red tape and bureaucracy. 
ECC.5.9	Even the king milks the land for his own profit!
ECC.5.10	Those who love money will never have enough. How meaningless to think that wealth brings true happiness! 
ECC.5.11	The more you have, the more people come to help you spend it. So what good is wealth—except perhaps to watch it slip through your fingers!
ECC.5.12	People who work hard sleep well, whether they eat little or much. But the rich seldom get a good night’s sleep.
ECC.5.13	There is another serious problem I have seen under the sun. Hoarding riches harms the saver. 
ECC.5.14	Money is put into risky investments that turn sour, and everything is lost. In the end, there is nothing left to pass on to one’s children. 
ECC.5.15	We all come to the end of our lives as naked and empty-handed as on the day we were born. We can’t take our riches with us.
ECC.5.16	And this, too, is a very serious problem. People leave this world no better off than when they came. All their hard work is for nothing—like working for the wind. 
ECC.5.17	Throughout their lives, they live under a cloud—frustrated, discouraged, and angry.
ECC.5.18	Even so, I have noticed one thing, at least, that is good. It is good for people to eat, drink, and enjoy their work under the sun during the short life God has given them, and to accept their lot in life. 
ECC.5.19	And it is a good thing to receive wealth from God and the good health to enjoy it. To enjoy your work and accept your lot in life—this is indeed a gift from God. 
ECC.5.20	God keeps such people so busy enjoying life that they take no time to brood over the past.
ECC.6.1	There is another serious tragedy I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily on humanity. 
ECC.6.2	God gives some people great wealth and honor and everything they could ever want, but then he doesn’t give them the chance to enjoy these things. They die, and someone else, even a stranger, ends up enjoying their wealth! This is meaningless—a sickening tragedy.
ECC.6.3	A man might have a hundred children and live to be very old. But if he finds no satisfaction in life and doesn’t even get a decent burial, it would have been better for him to be born dead. 
ECC.6.4	His birth would have been meaningless, and he would have ended in darkness. He wouldn’t even have had a name, 
ECC.6.5	and he would never have seen the sun or known of its existence. Yet he would have had more peace than in growing up to be an unhappy man. 
ECC.6.6	He might live a thousand years twice over but still not find contentment. And since he must die like everyone else—well, what’s the use?
ECC.6.7	All people spend their lives scratching for food, but they never seem to have enough. 
ECC.6.8	So are wise people really better off than fools? Do poor people gain anything by being wise and knowing how to act in front of others?
ECC.6.9	Enjoy what you have rather than desiring what you don’t have. Just dreaming about nice things is meaningless—like chasing the wind.
ECC.6.10	Everything has already been decided. It was known long ago what each person would be. So there’s no use arguing with God about your destiny.
ECC.6.11	The more words you speak, the less they mean. So what good are they?
ECC.6.12	In the few days of our meaningless lives, who knows how our days can best be spent? Our lives are like a shadow. Who can tell what will happen on this earth after we are gone?
ECC.7.1	A good reputation is more valuable than costly perfume.
ECC.7.1	And the day you die is better than the day you are born.
ECC.7.2	Better to spend your time at funerals than at parties.
ECC.7.2	After all, everyone dies—
ECC.7.2	so the living should take this to heart.
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter,
ECC.7.3	for sadness has a refining influence on us.
ECC.7.4	A wise person thinks a lot about death,
ECC.7.4	while a fool thinks only about having a good time.
ECC.7.5	Better to be criticized by a wise person
ECC.7.5	than to be praised by a fool.
ECC.7.6	A fool’s laughter is quickly gone,
ECC.7.6	like thorns crackling in a fire.
ECC.7.6	This also is meaningless.
ECC.7.7	Extortion turns wise people into fools,
ECC.7.7	and bribes corrupt the heart.
ECC.7.8	Finishing is better than starting.
ECC.7.8	Patience is better than pride.
ECC.7.9	Control your temper,
ECC.7.9	for anger labels you a fool.
ECC.7.10	Don’t long for “the good old days.”
ECC.7.10	This is not wise.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom is even better when you have money.
ECC.7.11	Both are a benefit as you go through life.
ECC.7.12	Wisdom and money can get you almost anything,
ECC.7.12	but only wisdom can save your life.
ECC.7.13	Accept the way God does things,
ECC.7.13	for who can straighten what he has made crooked?
ECC.7.14	Enjoy prosperity while you can,
ECC.7.14	but when hard times strike, realize that both come from God.
ECC.7.14	Remember that nothing is certain in this life.
ECC.7.15	I have seen everything in this meaningless life, including the death of good young people and the long life of wicked people. 
ECC.7.16	So don’t be too good or too wise! Why destroy yourself? 
ECC.7.17	On the other hand, don’t be too wicked either. Don’t be a fool! Why die before your time? 
ECC.7.18	Pay attention to these instructions, for anyone who fears God will avoid both extremes.
ECC.7.19	One wise person is stronger than ten leading citizens of a town!
ECC.7.20	Not a single person on earth is always good and never sins.
ECC.7.21	Don’t eavesdrop on others—you may hear your servant curse you. 
ECC.7.22	For you know how often you yourself have cursed others.
ECC.7.23	I have always tried my best to let wisdom guide my thoughts and actions. I said to myself, “I am determined to be wise.” But it didn’t work. 
ECC.7.24	Wisdom is always distant and difficult to find. 
ECC.7.25	I searched everywhere, determined to find wisdom and to understand the reason for things. I was determined to prove to myself that wickedness is stupid and that foolishness is madness.
ECC.7.26	I discovered that a seductive woman
ECC.7.27	“This is my conclusion,” says the Teacher. “I discovered this after looking at the matter from every possible angle. 
ECC.7.28	Though I have searched repeatedly, I have not found what I was looking for. Only one out of a thousand men is virtuous, but not one woman! 
ECC.7.29	But I did find this: God created people to be virtuous, but they have each turned to follow their own downward path.”
ECC.8.1	How wonderful to be wise,
ECC.8.1	to analyze and interpret things.
ECC.8.1	Wisdom lights up a person’s face,
ECC.8.1	softening its harshness.
ECC.8.2	Obey the king since you vowed to God that you would. 
ECC.8.3	Don’t try to avoid doing your duty, and don’t stand with those who plot evil, for the king can do whatever he wants. 
ECC.8.4	His command is backed by great power. No one can resist or question it. 
ECC.8.5	Those who obey him will not be punished. Those who are wise will find a time and a way to do what is right, 
ECC.8.6	for there is a time and a way for everything, even when a person is in trouble.
ECC.8.7	Indeed, how can people avoid what they don’t know is going to happen? 
ECC.8.8	None of us can hold back our spirit from departing. None of us has the power to prevent the day of our death. There is no escaping that obligation, that dark battle. And in the face of death, wickedness will certainly not rescue the wicked.
ECC.8.9	I have thought deeply about all that goes on here under the sun, where people have the power to hurt each other. 
ECC.8.10	I have seen wicked people buried with honor. Yet they were the very ones who frequented the Temple and are now praised
ECC.8.11	When a crime is not punished quickly, people feel it is safe to do wrong. 
ECC.8.12	But even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time, I know that those who fear God will be better off. 
ECC.8.13	The wicked will not prosper, for they do not fear God. Their days will never grow long like the evening shadows.
ECC.8.14	And this is not all that is meaningless in our world. In this life, good people are often treated as though they were wicked, and wicked people are often treated as though they were good. This is so meaningless!
ECC.8.15	So I recommend having fun, because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat, drink, and enjoy life. That way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work God gives them under the sun.
ECC.8.16	In my search for wisdom and in my observation of people’s burdens here on earth, I discovered that there is ceaseless activity, day and night. 
ECC.8.17	I realized that no one can discover everything God is doing under the sun. Not even the wisest people discover everything, no matter what they claim.
ECC.9.1	This, too, I carefully explored: Even though the actions of godly and wise people are in God’s hands, no one knows whether God will show them favor. 
ECC.9.2	The same destiny ultimately awaits everyone, whether righteous or wicked, good or bad,
ECC.9.3	It seems so wrong that everyone under the sun suffers the same fate. Already twisted by evil, people choose their own mad course, for they have no hope. There is nothing ahead but death anyway. 
ECC.9.4	There is hope only for the living. As they say, “It’s better to be a live dog than a dead lion!”
ECC.9.5	The living at least know they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, nor are they remembered. 
ECC.9.6	Whatever they did in their lifetime—loving, hating, envying—is all long gone. They no longer play a part in anything here on earth. 
ECC.9.7	So go ahead. Eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a happy heart, for God approves of this! 
ECC.9.8	Wear fine clothes, with a splash of cologne!
ECC.9.9	Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil. 
ECC.9.10	Whatever you do, do well. For when you go to the grave,
ECC.9.11	I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn’t always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don’t always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time.
ECC.9.12	People can never predict when hard times might come. Like fish in a net or birds in a trap, people are caught by sudden tragedy.
ECC.9.13	Here is another bit of wisdom that has impressed me as I have watched the way our world works. 
ECC.9.14	There was a small town with only a few people, and a great king came with his army and besieged it. 
ECC.9.15	A poor, wise man knew how to save the town, and so it was rescued. But afterward no one thought to thank him. 
ECC.9.16	So even though wisdom is better than strength, those who are wise will be despised if they are poor. What they say will not be appreciated for long.
ECC.9.17	Better to hear the quiet words of a wise person
ECC.9.17	than the shouts of a foolish king.
ECC.9.18	Better to have wisdom than weapons of war,
ECC.9.18	but one sinner can destroy much that is good.
ECC.10.1	As dead flies cause even a bottle of perfume to stink,
ECC.10.1	so a little foolishness spoils great wisdom and honor.
ECC.10.2	A wise person chooses the right road;
ECC.10.2	a fool takes the wrong one.
ECC.10.3	You can identify fools
ECC.10.3	just by the way they walk down the street!
ECC.10.4	If your boss is angry at you, don’t quit!
ECC.10.4	A quiet spirit can overcome even great mistakes.
ECC.10.5	There is another evil I have seen under the sun. Kings and rulers make a grave mistake 
ECC.10.6	when they give great authority to foolish people and low positions to people of proven worth. 
ECC.10.7	I have even seen servants riding horseback like princes—and princes walking like servants!
ECC.10.8	When you dig a well,
ECC.10.8	you might fall in.
ECC.10.8	When you demolish an old wall,
ECC.10.8	you could be bitten by a snake.
ECC.10.9	When you work in a quarry,
ECC.10.9	stones might fall and crush you.
ECC.10.9	When you chop wood,
ECC.10.9	there is danger with each stroke of your ax.
ECC.10.10	Using a dull ax requires great strength,
ECC.10.10	so sharpen the blade.
ECC.10.10	That’s the value of wisdom;
ECC.10.10	it helps you succeed.
ECC.10.11	If a snake bites before you charm it,
ECC.10.11	what’s the use of being a snake charmer?
ECC.10.12	Wise words bring approval,
ECC.10.12	but fools are destroyed by their own words.
ECC.10.13	Fools base their thoughts on foolish assumptions,
ECC.10.13	so their conclusions will be wicked madness;
ECC.10.14	they chatter on and on.
ECC.10.14	No one really knows what is going to happen;
ECC.10.14	no one can predict the future.
ECC.10.15	Fools are so exhausted by a little work
ECC.10.15	that they can’t even find their way home.
ECC.10.16	What sorrow for the land ruled by a servant,
ECC.10.16	the land whose leaders feast in the morning.
ECC.10.17	Happy is the land whose king is a noble leader
ECC.10.17	and whose leaders feast at the proper time
ECC.10.17	to gain strength for their work, not to get drunk.
ECC.10.18	Laziness leads to a sagging roof;
ECC.10.18	idleness leads to a leaky house.
ECC.10.19	A party gives laughter,
ECC.10.19	wine gives happiness,
ECC.10.19	and money gives everything!
ECC.10.20	Never make light of the king, even in your thoughts.
ECC.10.20	And don’t make fun of the powerful, even in your own bedroom.
ECC.10.20	For a little bird might deliver your message
ECC.10.20	and tell them what you said.
ECC.11.1	Send your grain across the seas,
ECC.11.1	and in time, profits will flow back to you.
ECC.11.2	But divide your investments among many places,
ECC.11.2	for you do not know what risks might lie ahead.
ECC.11.3	When clouds are heavy, the rains come down.
ECC.11.3	Whether a tree falls north or south, it stays where it falls.
ECC.11.4	Farmers who wait for perfect weather never plant.
ECC.11.4	If they watch every cloud, they never harvest.
ECC.11.5	Just as you cannot understand the path of the wind or the mystery of a tiny baby growing in its mother’s womb,
ECC.11.6	Plant your seed in the morning and keep busy all afternoon, for you don’t know if profit will come from one activity or another—or maybe both.
ECC.11.7	Light is sweet; how pleasant to see a new day dawning.
ECC.11.8	When people live to be very old, let them rejoice in every day of life. But let them also remember there will be many dark days. Everything still to come is meaningless.
ECC.11.9	Young people,
ECC.11.10	So refuse to worry, and keep your body healthy. But remember that youth, with a whole life before you, is meaningless.
ECC.12.1	Don’t let the excitement of youth cause you to forget your Creator. Honor him in your youth before you grow old and say, “Life is not pleasant anymore.” 
ECC.12.2	Remember him before the light of the sun, moon, and stars is dim to your old eyes, and rain clouds continually darken your sky. 
ECC.12.3	Remember him before your legs—the guards of your house—start to tremble; and before your shoulders—the strong men—stoop. Remember him before your teeth—your few remaining servants—stop grinding; and before your eyes—the women looking through the windows—see dimly.
ECC.12.4	Remember him before the door to life’s opportunities is closed and the sound of work fades. Now you rise at the first chirping of the birds, but then all their sounds will grow faint.
ECC.12.5	Remember him before you become fearful of falling and worry about danger in the streets; before your hair turns white like an almond tree in bloom, and you drag along without energy like a dying grasshopper, and the caperberry no longer inspires sexual desire. Remember him before you near the grave, your everlasting home, when the mourners will weep at your funeral.
ECC.12.6	Yes, remember your Creator now while you are young, before the silver cord of life snaps and the golden bowl is broken. Don’t wait until the water jar is smashed at the spring and the pulley is broken at the well. 
ECC.12.7	For then the dust will return to the earth, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.
ECC.12.8	“Everything is meaningless,” says the Teacher, “completely meaningless.”
ECC.12.9	Keep this in mind: The Teacher was considered wise, and he taught the people everything he knew. He listened carefully to many proverbs, studying and classifying them. 
ECC.12.10	The Teacher sought to find just the right words to express truths clearly.
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise are like cattle prods—painful but helpful. Their collected sayings are like a nail-studded stick with which a shepherd
ECC.12.12	But, my child,
ECC.12.13	That’s the whole story. Here now is my final conclusion: Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone’s duty. 
ECC.12.14	God will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad.
SNG.1.1	This is Solomon’s song of songs, more wonderful than any other.
SNG.1.2	Kiss me and kiss me again,
SNG.1.2	for your love is sweeter than wine.
SNG.1.3	How pleasing is your fragrance;
SNG.1.3	your name is like the spreading fragrance of scented oils.
SNG.1.3	No wonder all the young women love you!
SNG.1.4	Take me with you; come, let’s run!
SNG.1.4	The king has brought me into his bedroom.
SNG.1.4	How happy we are for you, O king.
SNG.1.4	We praise your love even more than wine.
SNG.1.4	How right they are to adore you.
SNG.1.5	I am dark but beautiful,
SNG.1.5	O women of Jerusalem—
SNG.1.5	dark as the tents of Kedar,
SNG.1.5	dark as the curtains of Solomon’s tents.
SNG.1.6	Don’t stare at me because I am dark—
SNG.1.6	the sun has darkened my skin.
SNG.1.6	My brothers were angry with me;
SNG.1.6	they forced me to care for their vineyards,
SNG.1.6	so I couldn’t care for myself—my own vineyard.
SNG.1.7	Tell me, my love, where are you leading your flock today?
SNG.1.7	Where will you rest your sheep at noon?
SNG.1.7	For why should I wander like a prostitute
SNG.1.7	among your friends and their flocks?
SNG.1.8	If you don’t know, O most beautiful woman,
SNG.1.8	follow the trail of my flock,
SNG.1.8	and graze your young goats by the shepherds’ tents.
SNG.1.9	You are as exciting, my darling,
SNG.1.9	as a mare among Pharaoh’s stallions.
SNG.1.10	How lovely are your cheeks;
SNG.1.10	your earrings set them afire!
SNG.1.10	How lovely is your neck,
SNG.1.10	enhanced by a string of jewels.
SNG.1.11	We will make for you earrings of gold
SNG.1.11	and beads of silver.
SNG.1.12	The king is lying on his couch,
SNG.1.12	enchanted by the fragrance of my perfume.
SNG.1.13	My lover is like a sachet of myrrh
SNG.1.13	lying between my breasts.
SNG.1.14	He is like a bouquet of sweet henna blossoms
SNG.1.14	from the vineyards of En-gedi.
SNG.1.15	How beautiful you are, my darling,
SNG.1.15	how beautiful!
SNG.1.15	Your eyes are like doves.
SNG.1.16	You are so handsome, my love,
SNG.1.16	pleasing beyond words!
SNG.1.16	The soft grass is our bed;
SNG.1.17	fragrant cedar branches are the beams of our house,
SNG.1.17	and pleasant smelling firs are the rafters.
SNG.2.1	I am the spring crocus blooming on the Sharon Plain,
SNG.2.1	the lily of the valley.
SNG.2.2	Like a lily among thistles
SNG.2.2	is my darling among young women.
SNG.2.3	Like the finest apple tree in the orchard
SNG.2.3	is my lover among other young men.
SNG.2.3	I sit in his delightful shade
SNG.2.3	and taste his delicious fruit.
SNG.2.4	He escorts me to the banquet hall;
SNG.2.4	it’s obvious how much he loves me.
SNG.2.5	Strengthen me with raisin cakes,
SNG.2.5	refresh me with apples,
SNG.2.5	for I am weak with love.
SNG.2.6	His left arm is under my head,
SNG.2.6	and his right arm embraces me.
SNG.2.7	Promise me, O women of Jerusalem,
SNG.2.7	by the gazelles and wild deer,
SNG.2.7	not to awaken love until the time is right.
SNG.2.8	Ah, I hear my lover coming!
SNG.2.8	He is leaping over the mountains,
SNG.2.8	bounding over the hills.
SNG.2.9	My lover is like a swift gazelle
SNG.2.9	or a young stag.
SNG.2.9	Look, there he is behind the wall,
SNG.2.9	looking through the window,
SNG.2.9	peering into the room.
SNG.2.10	My lover said to me,
SNG.2.10	“Rise up, my darling!
SNG.2.10	Come away with me, my fair one!
SNG.2.11	Look, the winter is past,
SNG.2.11	and the rains are over and gone.
SNG.2.12	The flowers are springing up,
SNG.2.12	the season of singing birds
SNG.2.12	and the cooing of turtledoves fills the air.
SNG.2.13	The fig trees are forming young fruit,
SNG.2.13	and the fragrant grapevines are blossoming.
SNG.2.13	Rise up, my darling!
SNG.2.13	Come away with me, my fair one!”
SNG.2.14	My dove is hiding behind the rocks,
SNG.2.14	behind an outcrop on the cliff.
SNG.2.14	Let me see your face;
SNG.2.14	let me hear your voice.
SNG.2.14	For your voice is pleasant,
SNG.2.14	and your face is lovely.
SNG.2.15	Catch all the foxes,
SNG.2.15	those little foxes,
SNG.2.15	before they ruin the vineyard of love,
SNG.2.15	for the grapevines are blossoming!
SNG.2.16	My lover is mine, and I am his.
SNG.2.16	He browses among the lilies.
SNG.2.17	Before the dawn breezes blow
SNG.2.17	and the night shadows flee,
SNG.2.17	return to me, my love, like a gazelle
SNG.2.17	or a young stag on the rugged mountains.
SNG.3.1	One night as I lay in bed, I yearned for my lover.
SNG.3.1	I yearned for him, but he did not come.
SNG.3.2	So I said to myself, “I will get up and roam the city,
SNG.3.2	searching in all its streets and squares.
SNG.3.2	I will search for the one I love.”
SNG.3.2	So I searched everywhere but did not find him.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen stopped me as they made their rounds,
SNG.3.3	and I asked, “Have you seen the one I love?”
SNG.3.4	Then scarcely had I left them
SNG.3.4	when I found my love!
SNG.3.4	I caught and held him tightly,
SNG.3.4	then I brought him to my mother’s house,
SNG.3.4	into my mother’s bed, where I had been conceived.
SNG.3.5	Promise me, O women of Jerusalem,
SNG.3.5	by the gazelles and wild deer,
SNG.3.5	not to awaken love until the time is right.
SNG.3.6	Who is this sweeping in from the wilderness
SNG.3.6	like a cloud of smoke?
SNG.3.6	Who is it, fragrant with myrrh and frankincense
SNG.3.6	and every kind of spice?
SNG.3.7	Look, it is Solomon’s carriage,
SNG.3.7	surrounded by sixty heroic men,
SNG.3.7	the best of Israel’s soldiers.
SNG.3.8	They are all skilled swordsmen,
SNG.3.8	experienced warriors.
SNG.3.8	Each wears a sword on his thigh,
SNG.3.8	ready to defend the king against an attack in the night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon’s carriage is built
SNG.3.9	of wood imported from Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	Its posts are silver,
SNG.3.10	its canopy gold;
SNG.3.10	its cushions are purple.
SNG.3.10	It was decorated with love
SNG.3.10	by the young women of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Come out to see King Solomon,
SNG.3.11	young women of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	He wears the crown his mother gave him on his wedding day,
SNG.3.11	his most joyous day.
SNG.4.1	You are beautiful, my darling,
SNG.4.1	beautiful beyond words.
SNG.4.1	Your eyes are like doves
SNG.4.1	behind your veil.
SNG.4.1	Your hair falls in waves,
SNG.4.1	like a flock of goats winding down the slopes of Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are as white as sheep,
SNG.4.2	recently shorn and freshly washed.
SNG.4.2	Your smile is flawless,
SNG.4.2	each tooth matched with its twin.
SNG.4.3	Your lips are like scarlet ribbon;
SNG.4.3	your mouth is inviting.
SNG.4.3	Your cheeks are like rosy pomegranates
SNG.4.3	behind your veil.
SNG.4.4	Your neck is as beautiful as the tower of David,
SNG.4.4	jeweled with the shields of a thousand heroes.
SNG.4.5	Your breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.4.5	twin fawns of a gazelle grazing among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Before the dawn breezes blow
SNG.4.6	and the night shadows flee,
SNG.4.6	I will hurry to the mountain of myrrh
SNG.4.6	and to the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	You are altogether beautiful, my darling,
SNG.4.7	beautiful in every way.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
SNG.4.8	come with me from Lebanon.
SNG.4.8	Come down
SNG.4.8	from the peaks of Senir and Hermon,
SNG.4.8	where the lions have their dens
SNG.4.8	and leopards live among the hills.
SNG.4.9	You have captured my heart,
SNG.4.9	my treasure,
SNG.4.9	You hold it hostage with one glance of your eyes,
SNG.4.9	with a single jewel of your necklace.
SNG.4.10	Your love delights me,
SNG.4.10	my treasure, my bride.
SNG.4.10	Your love is better than wine,
SNG.4.10	your perfume more fragrant than spices.
SNG.4.11	Your lips are as sweet as nectar, my bride.
SNG.4.11	Honey and milk are under your tongue.
SNG.4.11	Your clothes are scented
SNG.4.11	like the cedars of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	You are my private garden, my treasure, my bride,
SNG.4.12	a secluded spring, a hidden fountain.
SNG.4.13	Your thighs shelter a paradise of pomegranates
SNG.4.13	with rare spices—
SNG.4.13	henna with nard,
SNG.4.14	nard and saffron,
SNG.4.14	fragrant calamus and cinnamon,
SNG.4.14	with all the trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes,
SNG.4.14	and every other lovely spice.
SNG.4.15	You are a garden fountain,
SNG.4.15	a well of fresh water
SNG.4.15	streaming down from Lebanon’s mountains. 
SNG.4.16	Awake, north wind!
SNG.4.16	Rise up, south wind!
SNG.4.16	Blow on my garden
SNG.4.16	and spread its fragrance all around.
SNG.4.16	Come into your garden, my love;
SNG.4.16	taste its finest fruits.
SNG.5.1	I have entered my garden, my treasure,
SNG.5.1	I gather myrrh with my spices
SNG.5.1	and eat honeycomb with my honey.
SNG.5.1	I drink wine with my milk.
SNG.5.1	Oh, lover and beloved, eat and drink!
SNG.5.1	Yes, drink deeply of your love!
SNG.5.2	I slept, but my heart was awake,
SNG.5.2	when I heard my lover knocking and calling:
SNG.5.2	“Open to me, my treasure, my darling,
SNG.5.2	my dove, my perfect one.
SNG.5.2	My head is drenched with dew,
SNG.5.2	my hair with the dampness of the night.”
SNG.5.3	But I responded,
SNG.5.3	“I have taken off my robe.
SNG.5.3	Should I get dressed again?
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet.
SNG.5.3	Should I get them soiled?”
SNG.5.4	My lover tried to unlatch the door,
SNG.5.4	and my heart thrilled within me.
SNG.5.5	I jumped up to open the door for my love,
SNG.5.5	and my hands dripped with perfume.
SNG.5.5	My fingers dripped with lovely myrrh
SNG.5.5	as I pulled back the bolt.
SNG.5.6	I opened to my lover,
SNG.5.6	but he was gone!
SNG.5.6	My heart sank.
SNG.5.6	I searched for him
SNG.5.6	but could not find him anywhere.
SNG.5.6	I called to him,
SNG.5.6	but there was no reply.
SNG.5.7	The night watchmen found me
SNG.5.7	as they made their rounds.
SNG.5.7	They beat and bruised me
SNG.5.7	and stripped off my veil,
SNG.5.7	those watchmen on the walls.
SNG.5.8	Make this promise, O women of Jerusalem—
SNG.5.8	If you find my lover,
SNG.5.8	tell him I am weak with love.
SNG.5.9	Why is your lover better than all others,
SNG.5.9	O woman of rare beauty?
SNG.5.9	What makes your lover so special
SNG.5.9	that we must promise this?
SNG.5.10	My lover is dark and dazzling,
SNG.5.10	better than ten thousand others!
SNG.5.11	His head is finest gold,
SNG.5.11	his wavy hair is black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes sparkle like doves
SNG.5.12	beside springs of water;
SNG.5.12	they are set like jewels
SNG.5.12	washed in milk.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are like gardens of spices
SNG.5.13	giving off fragrance.
SNG.5.13	His lips are like lilies,
SNG.5.13	perfumed with myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His arms are like rounded bars of gold,
SNG.5.14	set with beryl.
SNG.5.14	His body is like bright ivory,
SNG.5.14	glowing with lapis lazuli.
SNG.5.15	His legs are like marble pillars
SNG.5.15	set in sockets of finest gold.
SNG.5.15	His posture is stately,
SNG.5.15	like the noble cedars of Lebanon.
SNG.5.16	His mouth is sweetness itself;
SNG.5.16	he is desirable in every way.
SNG.5.16	Such, O women of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.16	is my lover, my friend.
SNG.6.1	Where has your lover gone,
SNG.6.1	O woman of rare beauty?
SNG.6.1	Which way did he turn
SNG.6.1	so we can help you find him?
SNG.6.2	My lover has gone down to his garden,
SNG.6.2	to his spice beds,
SNG.6.2	to browse in the gardens
SNG.6.2	and gather the lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am my lover’s, and my lover is mine.
SNG.6.3	He browses among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	You are beautiful, my darling,
SNG.6.4	like the lovely city of Tirzah.
SNG.6.4	Yes, as beautiful as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	as majestic as an army with billowing banners.
SNG.6.5	Turn your eyes away,
SNG.6.5	for they overpower me.
SNG.6.5	Your hair falls in waves,
SNG.6.5	like a flock of goats winding down the slopes of Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are as white as sheep
SNG.6.6	that are freshly washed.
SNG.6.6	Your smile is flawless,
SNG.6.6	each tooth matched with its twin.
SNG.6.7	Your cheeks are like rosy pomegranates
SNG.6.7	behind your veil.
SNG.6.8	Even among sixty queens
SNG.6.8	and eighty concubines
SNG.6.8	and countless young women,
SNG.6.9	I would still choose my dove, my perfect one—
SNG.6.9	the favorite of her mother,
SNG.6.9	dearly loved by the one who bore her.
SNG.6.9	The young women see her and praise her;
SNG.6.9	even queens and royal concubines sing her praises:
SNG.6.10	“Who is this, arising like the dawn,
SNG.6.10	as fair as the moon,
SNG.6.10	as bright as the sun,
SNG.6.10	as majestic as an army with billowing banners?”
SNG.6.11	I went down to the grove of walnut trees
SNG.6.11	and out to the valley to see the new spring growth,
SNG.6.11	to see whether the grapevines had budded
SNG.6.11	or the pomegranates were in bloom.
SNG.6.12	Before I realized it,
SNG.6.12	my strong desires had taken me to the chariot of a noble man.
SNG.6.13	Return, return to us, O maid of Shulam.
SNG.6.13	Come back, come back, that we may see you again.
SNG.6.13	Why do you stare at this young woman of Shulam,
SNG.6.13	as she moves so gracefully between two lines of dancers?
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are your sandaled feet,
SNG.7.1	O queenly maiden.
SNG.7.1	Your rounded thighs are like jewels,
SNG.7.1	the work of a skilled craftsman.
SNG.7.2	Your navel is perfectly formed
SNG.7.2	like a goblet filled with mixed wine.
SNG.7.2	Between your thighs lies a mound of wheat
SNG.7.2	bordered with lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.7.3	twin fawns of a gazelle.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is as beautiful as an ivory tower.
SNG.7.4	Your eyes are like the sparkling pools in Heshbon
SNG.7.4	by the gate of Bath-rabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is as fine as the tower of Lebanon
SNG.7.4	overlooking Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head is as majestic as Mount Carmel,
SNG.7.5	and the sheen of your hair radiates royalty.
SNG.7.5	The king is held captive by its tresses.
SNG.7.6	Oh, how beautiful you are!
SNG.7.6	How pleasing, my love, how full of delights!
SNG.7.7	You are slender like a palm tree,
SNG.7.7	and your breasts are like its clusters of fruit.
SNG.7.8	I said, “I will climb the palm tree
SNG.7.8	and take hold of its fruit.”
SNG.7.8	May your breasts be like grape clusters,
SNG.7.8	and the fragrance of your breath like apples.
SNG.7.9	May your kisses be as exciting as the best wine—
SNG.7.9	Yes, wine that goes down smoothly for my lover,
SNG.7.9	flowing gently over lips and teeth.
SNG.7.10	I am my lover’s,
SNG.7.10	and he claims me as his own.
SNG.7.11	Come, my love, let us go out to the fields
SNG.7.11	and spend the night among the wildflowers.
SNG.7.12	Let us get up early and go to the vineyards
SNG.7.12	to see if the grapevines have budded,
SNG.7.12	if the blossoms have opened,
SNG.7.12	and if the pomegranates have bloomed.
SNG.7.12	There I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	There the mandrakes give off their fragrance,
SNG.7.13	and the finest fruits are at our door,
SNG.7.13	new delights as well as old,
SNG.7.13	which I have saved for you, my lover.
SNG.8.1	Oh, I wish you were my brother,
SNG.8.1	who nursed at my mother’s breasts.
SNG.8.1	Then I could kiss you no matter who was watching,
SNG.8.1	and no one would criticize me.
SNG.8.2	I would bring you to my childhood home,
SNG.8.2	and there you would teach me.
SNG.8.2	I would give you spiced wine to drink,
SNG.8.2	my sweet pomegranate wine.
SNG.8.3	Your left arm would be under my head,
SNG.8.3	and your right arm would embrace me.
SNG.8.4	Promise me, O women of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	not to awaken love until the time is right.
SNG.8.5	Who is this sweeping in from the desert,
SNG.8.5	leaning on her lover?
SNG.8.5	I aroused you under the apple tree,
SNG.8.5	where your mother gave you birth,
SNG.8.5	where in great pain she delivered you.
SNG.8.6	Place me like a seal over your heart,
SNG.8.6	like a seal on your arm.
SNG.8.6	For love is as strong as death,
SNG.8.6	its jealousy
SNG.8.6	Love flashes like fire,
SNG.8.6	the brightest kind of flame.
SNG.8.7	Many waters cannot quench love,
SNG.8.7	nor can rivers drown it.
SNG.8.7	If a man tried to buy love
SNG.8.7	with all his wealth,
SNG.8.7	his offer would be utterly scorned.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister
SNG.8.8	too young to have breasts.
SNG.8.8	What will we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	if someone asks to marry her?
SNG.8.9	If she is a virgin, like a wall,
SNG.8.9	we will protect her with a silver tower.
SNG.8.9	But if she is promiscuous, like a swinging door,
SNG.8.9	we will block her door with a cedar bar.
SNG.8.10	I was a virgin, like a wall;
SNG.8.10	now my breasts are like towers.
SNG.8.10	When my lover looks at me,
SNG.8.10	he is delighted with what he sees.
SNG.8.11	Solomon has a vineyard at Baal-hamon,
SNG.8.11	which he leases out to tenant farmers.
SNG.8.11	Each of them pays a thousand pieces of silver
SNG.8.11	for harvesting its fruit.
SNG.8.12	But my vineyard is mine to give,
SNG.8.12	and Solomon need not pay a thousand pieces of silver.
SNG.8.12	But I will give two hundred pieces
SNG.8.12	to those who care for its vines.
SNG.8.13	O my darling, lingering in the gardens,
SNG.8.13	your companions are fortunate to hear your voice.
SNG.8.13	Let me hear it, too!
SNG.8.14	Come away, my love! Be like a gazelle
SNG.8.14	or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
ISA.1.1	These are the visions that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. He saw these visions during the years when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah.
ISA.1.2	Listen, O heavens! Pay attention, earth!
ISA.1.2	This is what the 
ISA.1.2	“The children I raised and cared for
ISA.1.2	have rebelled against me.
ISA.1.3	Even an ox knows its owner,
ISA.1.3	and a donkey recognizes its master’s care—
ISA.1.3	but Israel doesn’t know its master.
ISA.1.3	My people don’t recognize my care for them.”
ISA.1.4	Oh, what a sinful nation they are—
ISA.1.4	loaded down with a burden of guilt.
ISA.1.4	They are evil people,
ISA.1.4	corrupt children who have rejected the 
ISA.1.4	They have despised the Holy One of Israel
ISA.1.4	and turned their backs on him.
ISA.1.5	Why do you continue to invite punishment?
ISA.1.5	Must you rebel forever?
ISA.1.5	Your head is injured,
ISA.1.5	and your heart is sick.
ISA.1.6	You are battered from head to foot—
ISA.1.6	covered with bruises, welts, and infected wounds—
ISA.1.6	without any soothing ointments or bandages.
ISA.1.7	Your country lies in ruins,
ISA.1.7	and your towns are burned.
ISA.1.7	Foreigners plunder your fields before your eyes
ISA.1.7	and destroy everything they see.
ISA.1.8	Beautiful Jerusalem
ISA.1.8	like a watchman’s shelter in a vineyard,
ISA.1.8	like a lean-to in a cucumber field after the harvest,
ISA.1.8	like a helpless city under siege.
ISA.1.9	If the 
ISA.1.9	had not spared a few of us,
ISA.1.9	we would have been wiped out like Sodom,
ISA.1.9	destroyed like Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	Listen to the 
ISA.1.10	Listen to the law of our God, people of “Gomorrah.”
ISA.1.11	“What makes you think I want all your sacrifices?”
ISA.1.11	says the 
ISA.1.11	“I am sick of your burnt offerings of rams
ISA.1.11	and the fat of fattened cattle.
ISA.1.11	I get no pleasure from the blood
ISA.1.11	of bulls and lambs and goats.
ISA.1.12	When you come to worship me,
ISA.1.12	who asked you to parade through my courts with all your ceremony?
ISA.1.13	Stop bringing me your meaningless gifts;
ISA.1.13	the incense of your offerings disgusts me!
ISA.1.13	As for your celebrations of the new moon and the Sabbath
ISA.1.13	and your special days for fasting—
ISA.1.13	they are all sinful and false.
ISA.1.13	I want no more of your pious meetings.
ISA.1.14	I hate your new moon celebrations and your annual festivals.
ISA.1.14	They are a burden to me. I cannot stand them!
ISA.1.15	When you lift up your hands in prayer, I will not look.
ISA.1.15	Though you offer many prayers, I will not listen,
ISA.1.15	for your hands are covered with the blood of innocent victims.
ISA.1.16	Wash yourselves and be clean!
ISA.1.16	Get your sins out of my sight.
ISA.1.16	Give up your evil ways.
ISA.1.17	Learn to do good.
ISA.1.17	Seek justice.
ISA.1.17	Help the oppressed.
ISA.1.17	Defend the cause of orphans.
ISA.1.17	Fight for the rights of widows.
ISA.1.18	“Come now, let’s settle this,”
ISA.1.18	says the 
ISA.1.18	“Though your sins are like scarlet,
ISA.1.18	I will make them as white as snow.
ISA.1.18	Though they are red like crimson,
ISA.1.18	I will make them as white as wool.
ISA.1.19	If you will only obey me,
ISA.1.19	you will have plenty to eat.
ISA.1.20	But if you turn away and refuse to listen,
ISA.1.20	you will be devoured by the sword of your enemies.
ISA.1.20	I, the 
ISA.1.21	See how Jerusalem, once so faithful,
ISA.1.21	has become a prostitute.
ISA.1.21	Once the home of justice and righteousness,
ISA.1.21	she is now filled with murderers.
ISA.1.22	Once like pure silver,
ISA.1.22	you have become like worthless slag.
ISA.1.22	Once so pure,
ISA.1.22	you are now like watered-down wine.
ISA.1.23	Your leaders are rebels,
ISA.1.23	the companions of thieves.
ISA.1.23	All of them love bribes
ISA.1.23	and demand payoffs,
ISA.1.23	but they refuse to defend the cause of orphans
ISA.1.23	or fight for the rights of widows.
ISA.1.24	Therefore, the Lord, the 
ISA.1.24	the Mighty One of Israel, says,
ISA.1.24	“I will take revenge on my enemies
ISA.1.24	and pay back my foes!
ISA.1.25	I will raise my fist against you.
ISA.1.25	I will melt you down and skim off your slag.
ISA.1.25	I will remove all your impurities.
ISA.1.26	Then I will give you good judges again
ISA.1.26	and wise counselors like you used to have.
ISA.1.26	Then Jerusalem will again be called the Home of Justice
ISA.1.26	and the Faithful City.”
ISA.1.27	Zion will be restored by justice;
ISA.1.27	those who repent will be revived by righteousness.
ISA.1.28	But rebels and sinners will be completely destroyed,
ISA.1.28	and those who desert the 
ISA.1.29	You will be ashamed of your idol worship
ISA.1.29	in groves of sacred oaks.
ISA.1.29	You will blush because you worshiped
ISA.1.29	in gardens dedicated to idols.
ISA.1.30	You will be like a great tree with withered leaves,
ISA.1.30	like a garden without water.
ISA.1.31	The strongest among you will disappear like straw;
ISA.1.31	their evil deeds will be the spark that sets it on fire.
ISA.1.31	They and their evil works will burn up together,
ISA.1.31	and no one will be able to put out the fire.
ISA.2.1	This is a vision that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
ISA.2.2	In the last days, the mountain of the 
ISA.2.2	will be the highest of all—
ISA.2.2	the most important place on earth.
ISA.2.2	It will be raised above the other hills,
ISA.2.2	and people from all over the world will stream there to worship.
ISA.2.3	People from many nations will come and say,
ISA.2.3	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.3	to the house of Jacob’s God.
ISA.2.3	There he will teach us his ways,
ISA.2.3	and we will walk in his paths.”
ISA.2.3	For the 
ISA.2.3	his word will go out from Jerusalem.
ISA.2.4	The 
ISA.2.4	and will settle international disputes.
ISA.2.4	They will hammer their swords into plowshares
ISA.2.4	and their spears into pruning hooks.
ISA.2.4	Nation will no longer fight against nation,
ISA.2.4	nor train for war anymore.
ISA.2.5	Come, descendants of Jacob,
ISA.2.5	let us walk in the light of the 
ISA.2.6	For the 
ISA.2.6	the descendants of Jacob,
ISA.2.6	because they have filled their land with practices from the East
ISA.2.6	and with sorcerers, as the Philistines do.
ISA.2.6	They have made alliances with pagans.
ISA.2.7	Israel is full of silver and gold;
ISA.2.7	there is no end to its treasures.
ISA.2.7	Their land is full of warhorses;
ISA.2.7	there is no end to its chariots.
ISA.2.8	Their land is full of idols;
ISA.2.8	the people worship things they have made
ISA.2.8	with their own hands.
ISA.2.9	So now they will be humbled,
ISA.2.9	and all will be brought low—
ISA.2.9	do not forgive them.
ISA.2.10	Crawl into caves in the rocks.
ISA.2.10	Hide in the dust
ISA.2.10	from the terror of the 
ISA.2.10	and the glory of his majesty.
ISA.2.11	Human pride will be brought down,
ISA.2.11	and human arrogance will be humbled.
ISA.2.11	Only the 
ISA.2.11	on that day of judgment.
ISA.2.12	For the 
ISA.2.12	has a day of reckoning.
ISA.2.12	He will punish the proud and mighty
ISA.2.12	and bring down everything that is exalted.
ISA.2.13	He will cut down the tall cedars of Lebanon
ISA.2.13	and all the mighty oaks of Bashan.
ISA.2.14	He will level all the high mountains
ISA.2.14	and all the lofty hills.
ISA.2.15	He will break down every high tower
ISA.2.15	and every fortified wall.
ISA.2.16	He will destroy all the great trading ships
ISA.2.16	and every magnificent vessel.
ISA.2.17	Human pride will be humbled,
ISA.2.17	and human arrogance will be brought down.
ISA.2.17	Only the 
ISA.2.17	on that day of judgment.
ISA.2.18	Idols will completely disappear.
ISA.2.19	When the 
ISA.2.19	his enemies will crawl into holes in the ground.
ISA.2.19	They will hide in caves in the rocks
ISA.2.19	from the terror of the 
ISA.2.19	and the glory of his majesty.
ISA.2.20	On that day of judgment they will abandon the gold and silver idols
ISA.2.20	they made for themselves to worship.
ISA.2.20	They will leave their gods to the rodents and bats,
ISA.2.21	while they crawl away into caverns
ISA.2.21	and hide among the jagged rocks in the cliffs.
ISA.2.21	They will try to escape the terror of the 
ISA.2.21	and the glory of his majesty
ISA.2.21	as he rises to shake the earth.
ISA.2.22	Don’t put your trust in mere humans.
ISA.2.22	They are as frail as breath.
ISA.2.22	What good are they?
ISA.3.1	The Lord, the 
ISA.3.1	will take away from Jerusalem and Judah
ISA.3.1	everything they depend on:
ISA.3.1	every bit of bread
ISA.3.1	and every drop of water,
ISA.3.2	all their heroes and soldiers,
ISA.3.2	judges and prophets,
ISA.3.2	fortune-tellers and elders,
ISA.3.3	army officers and high officials,
ISA.3.3	advisers, skilled sorcerers, and astrologers.
ISA.3.4	I will make boys their leaders,
ISA.3.4	and toddlers their rulers.
ISA.3.5	People will oppress each other—
ISA.3.5	man against man,
ISA.3.5	neighbor against neighbor.
ISA.3.5	Young people will insult their elders,
ISA.3.5	and vulgar people will sneer at the honorable.
ISA.3.6	In those days a man will say to his brother,
ISA.3.6	“Since you have a coat, you be our leader!
ISA.3.6	Take charge of this heap of ruins!”
ISA.3.7	But he will reply,
ISA.3.7	“No! I can’t help.
ISA.3.7	I don’t have any extra food or clothes.
ISA.3.7	Don’t put me in charge!”
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem will stumble,
ISA.3.8	and Judah will fall,
ISA.3.8	because they speak out against the 
ISA.3.8	They provoke him to his face.
ISA.3.9	The very look on their faces gives them away.
ISA.3.9	They display their sin like the people of Sodom
ISA.3.9	and don’t even try to hide it.
ISA.3.9	They are doomed!
ISA.3.9	They have brought destruction upon themselves.
ISA.3.10	Tell the godly that all will be well for them.
ISA.3.10	They will enjoy the rich reward they have earned!
ISA.3.11	But the wicked are doomed,
ISA.3.11	for they will get exactly what they deserve.
ISA.3.12	Childish leaders oppress my people,
ISA.3.12	and women rule over them.
ISA.3.12	O my people, your leaders mislead you;
ISA.3.12	they send you down the wrong road.
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.13	and presents his case against his people.
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.14	on the elders and rulers of his people:
ISA.3.14	“You have ruined Israel, my vineyard.
ISA.3.14	Your houses are filled with things stolen from the poor.
ISA.3.15	How dare you crush my people,
ISA.3.15	grinding the faces of the poor into the dust?”
ISA.3.15	demands the Lord, the 
ISA.3.16	The 
ISA.3.16	craning her elegant neck,
ISA.3.16	flirting with her eyes,
ISA.3.16	walking with dainty steps,
ISA.3.16	tinkling her ankle bracelets.
ISA.3.17	So the Lord will send scabs on her head;
ISA.3.17	the 
ISA.3.18	On that day of judgment
ISA.3.18	the Lord will strip away everything that makes her beautiful:
ISA.3.18	ornaments, headbands, crescent necklaces,
ISA.3.19	earrings, bracelets, and veils;
ISA.3.20	scarves, ankle bracelets, sashes,
ISA.3.20	perfumes, and charms;
ISA.3.21	rings, jewels,
ISA.3.22	party clothes, gowns, capes, and purses;
ISA.3.23	mirrors, fine linen garments,
ISA.3.23	head ornaments, and shawls.
ISA.3.24	Instead of smelling of sweet perfume, she will stink.
ISA.3.24	She will wear a rope for a sash,
ISA.3.24	and her elegant hair will fall out.
ISA.3.24	She will wear rough burlap instead of rich robes.
ISA.3.24	Shame will replace her beauty.
ISA.3.25	The men of the city will be killed with the sword,
ISA.3.25	and her warriors will die in battle.
ISA.3.26	The gates of Zion will weep and mourn.
ISA.3.26	The city will be like a ravaged woman,
ISA.3.26	huddled on the ground.
ISA.4.1	In that day so few men will be left that seven women will fight for each man, saying, “Let us all marry you! We will provide our own food and clothing. Only let us take your name so we won’t be mocked as old maids.”
ISA.4.2	But in that day, the branch
ISA.4.2	will be beautiful and glorious;
ISA.4.2	the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory
ISA.4.2	of all who survive in Israel.
ISA.4.3	All who remain in Zion
ISA.4.3	will be a holy people—
ISA.4.3	those who survive the destruction of Jerusalem
ISA.4.3	and are recorded among the living.
ISA.4.4	The Lord will wash the filth from beautiful Zion
ISA.4.4	and cleanse Jerusalem of its bloodstains
ISA.4.4	with the hot breath of fiery judgment.
ISA.4.5	Then the 
ISA.4.5	and all who assemble there.
ISA.4.5	He will provide a canopy of cloud during the day
ISA.4.5	and smoke and flaming fire at night,
ISA.4.5	covering the glorious land.
ISA.4.6	It will be a shelter from daytime heat
ISA.4.6	and a hiding place from storms and rain.
ISA.5.1	Now I will sing for the one I love
ISA.5.1	a song about his vineyard:
ISA.5.1	My beloved had a vineyard
ISA.5.1	on a rich and fertile hill.
ISA.5.2	He plowed the land, cleared its stones,
ISA.5.2	and planted it with the best vines.
ISA.5.2	In the middle he built a watchtower
ISA.5.2	and carved a winepress in the nearby rocks.
ISA.5.2	Then he waited for a harvest of sweet grapes,
ISA.5.2	but the grapes that grew were bitter.
ISA.5.3	Now, you people of Jerusalem and Judah,
ISA.5.3	you judge between me and my vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What more could I have done for my vineyard
ISA.5.4	that I have not already done?
ISA.5.4	When I expected sweet grapes,
ISA.5.4	why did my vineyard give me bitter grapes?
ISA.5.5	Now let me tell you
ISA.5.5	what I will do to my vineyard:
ISA.5.5	I will tear down its hedges
ISA.5.5	and let it be destroyed.
ISA.5.5	I will break down its walls
ISA.5.5	and let the animals trample it.
ISA.5.6	I will make it a wild place
ISA.5.6	where the vines are not pruned and the ground is not hoed,
ISA.5.6	a place overgrown with briers and thorns.
ISA.5.6	I will command the clouds
ISA.5.6	to drop no rain on it.
ISA.5.7	The nation of Israel is the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.7	The people of Judah are his pleasant garden.
ISA.5.7	He expected a crop of justice,
ISA.5.7	but instead he found oppression.
ISA.5.7	He expected to find righteousness,
ISA.5.7	but instead he heard cries of violence.
ISA.5.8	What sorrow for you who buy up house after house and field after field,
ISA.5.8	until everyone is evicted and you live alone in the land.
ISA.5.9	But I have heard the 
ISA.5.9	swear a solemn oath:
ISA.5.9	“Many houses will stand deserted;
ISA.5.9	even beautiful mansions will be empty.
ISA.5.10	Ten acres
ISA.5.10	Ten baskets of seed will yield only one basket
ISA.5.11	What sorrow for those who get up early in the morning
ISA.5.11	looking for a drink of alcohol
ISA.5.11	and spend long evenings drinking wine
ISA.5.11	to make themselves flaming drunk.
ISA.5.12	They furnish wine and lovely music at their grand parties—
ISA.5.12	lyre and harp, tambourine and flute—
ISA.5.12	but they never think about the 
ISA.5.12	or notice what he is doing.
ISA.5.13	So my people will go into exile far away
ISA.5.13	because they do not know me.
ISA.5.13	Those who are great and honored will starve,
ISA.5.13	and the common people will die of thirst.
ISA.5.14	The grave
ISA.5.14	opening its mouth wide.
ISA.5.14	The great and the lowly
ISA.5.14	and all the drunken mob will be swallowed up.
ISA.5.15	Humanity will be destroyed, and people brought down;
ISA.5.15	even the arrogant will lower their eyes in humiliation.
ISA.5.16	But the 
ISA.5.16	The holiness of God will be displayed by his righteousness.
ISA.5.17	In that day lambs will find good pastures,
ISA.5.17	and fattened sheep and young goats
ISA.5.18	What sorrow for those who drag their sins behind them
ISA.5.18	with ropes made of lies,
ISA.5.18	who drag wickedness behind them like a cart!
ISA.5.19	They even mock God and say,
ISA.5.19	“Hurry up and do something!
ISA.5.19	We want to see what you can do.
ISA.5.19	Let the Holy One of Israel carry out his plan,
ISA.5.19	for we want to know what it is.”
ISA.5.20	What sorrow for those who say
ISA.5.20	that evil is good and good is evil,
ISA.5.20	that dark is light and light is dark,
ISA.5.20	that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.
ISA.5.21	What sorrow for those who are wise in their own eyes
ISA.5.21	and think themselves so clever.
ISA.5.22	What sorrow for those who are heroes at drinking wine
ISA.5.22	and boast about all the alcohol they can hold.
ISA.5.23	They take bribes to let the wicked go free,
ISA.5.23	and they punish the innocent.
ISA.5.24	Therefore, just as fire licks up stubble
ISA.5.24	and dry grass shrivels in the flame,
ISA.5.24	so their roots will rot
ISA.5.24	and their flowers wither.
ISA.5.24	For they have rejected the law of the 
ISA.5.24	they have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.5.25	That is why the 
ISA.5.25	and why he has raised his fist to crush them.
ISA.5.25	The mountains tremble,
ISA.5.25	and the corpses of his people litter the streets like garbage.
ISA.5.25	But even then the 
ISA.5.25	His fist is still poised to strike!
ISA.5.26	He will send a signal to distant nations far away
ISA.5.26	and whistle to those at the ends of the earth.
ISA.5.26	They will come racing toward Jerusalem.
ISA.5.27	They will not get tired or stumble.
ISA.5.27	They will not stop for rest or sleep.
ISA.5.27	Not a belt will be loose,
ISA.5.27	not a sandal strap broken.
ISA.5.28	Their arrows will be sharp
ISA.5.28	and their bows ready for battle.
ISA.5.28	Sparks will fly from their horses’ hooves,
ISA.5.28	and the wheels of their chariots will spin like a whirlwind.
ISA.5.29	They will roar like lions,
ISA.5.29	like the strongest of lions.
ISA.5.29	Growling, they will pounce on their victims and carry them off,
ISA.5.29	and no one will be there to rescue them.
ISA.5.30	They will roar over their victims on that day of destruction
ISA.5.30	like the roaring of the sea.
ISA.5.30	If someone looks across the land,
ISA.5.30	only darkness and distress will be seen;
ISA.5.30	even the light will be darkened by clouds.
ISA.6.1	It was in the year King Uzziah died
ISA.6.2	Attending him were mighty seraphim, each having six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. 
ISA.6.3	They were calling out to each other,
ISA.6.3	“Holy, holy, holy is the 
ISA.6.3	The whole earth is filled with his glory!”
ISA.6.4	Their voices shook the Temple to its foundations, and the entire building was filled with smoke.
ISA.6.5	Then I said, “It’s all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man. I have filthy lips, and I live among a people with filthy lips. Yet I have seen the King, the 
ISA.6.6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. 
ISA.6.7	He touched my lips with it and said, “See, this coal has touched your lips. Now your guilt is removed, and your sins are forgiven.”
ISA.6.8	Then I heard the Lord asking, “Whom should I send as a messenger to this people? Who will go for us?”
ISA.6.8	I said, “Here I am. Send me.”
ISA.6.9	And he said, “Yes, go, and say to this people, 
ISA.6.9	‘Listen carefully, but do not understand.
ISA.6.9	Watch closely, but learn nothing.’
ISA.6.10	Harden the hearts of these people.
ISA.6.10	Plug their ears and shut their eyes.
ISA.6.10	That way, they will not see with their eyes,
ISA.6.10	nor hear with their ears,
ISA.6.10	nor understand with their hearts
ISA.6.10	and turn to me for healing.”
ISA.6.11	Then I said, “Lord, how long will this go on?”
ISA.6.11	And he replied,
ISA.6.11	“Until their towns are empty,
ISA.6.11	their houses are deserted,
ISA.6.11	and the whole country is a wasteland;
ISA.6.12	until the 
ISA.6.12	and the entire land of Israel lies deserted.
ISA.6.13	If even a tenth—a remnant—survive,
ISA.6.13	it will be invaded again and burned.
ISA.6.13	But as a terebinth or oak tree leaves a stump when it is cut down,
ISA.6.13	so Israel’s stump will be a holy seed.”
ISA.7.1	When Ahaz, son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Syria
ISA.7.2	The news had come to the royal court of Judah: “Syria is allied with Israel
ISA.7.3	Then the 
ISA.7.4	Tell him to stop worrying. Tell him he doesn’t need to fear the fierce anger of those two burned-out embers, King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah. 
ISA.7.5	Yes, the kings of Syria and Israel are plotting against him, saying, 
ISA.7.6	‘We will attack Judah and capture it for ourselves. Then we will install the son of Tabeel as Judah’s king.’ 
ISA.7.7	But this is what the Sovereign 
ISA.7.7	“This invasion will never happen;
ISA.7.7	it will never take place;
ISA.7.8	for Syria is no stronger than its capital, Damascus,
ISA.7.8	and Damascus is no stronger than its king, Rezin.
ISA.7.8	As for Israel, within sixty-five years
ISA.7.8	it will be crushed and completely destroyed.
ISA.7.9	Israel is no stronger than its capital, Samaria,
ISA.7.9	and Samaria is no stronger than its king, Pekah son of Remaliah.
ISA.7.9	Unless your faith is firm,
ISA.7.9	I cannot make you stand firm.”
ISA.7.10	Later, the 
ISA.7.11	“Ask the 
ISA.7.12	But the king refused. “No,” he said, “I will not test the 
ISA.7.13	Then Isaiah said, “Listen well, you royal family of David! Isn’t it enough to exhaust human patience? Must you exhaust the patience of my God as well? 
ISA.7.14	All right then, the Lord himself will give you the sign. Look! The virgin
ISA.7.15	By the time this child is old enough to choose what is right and reject what is wrong, he will be eating yogurt
ISA.7.16	For before the child is that old, the lands of the two kings you fear so much will both be deserted.
ISA.7.17	“Then the 
ISA.7.18	In that day the 
ISA.7.19	They will come in vast hordes and settle in the fertile areas and also in the desolate valleys, caves, and thorny places. 
ISA.7.20	In that day the Lord will hire a “razor” from beyond the Euphrates River
ISA.7.21	In that day a farmer will be fortunate to have a cow and two sheep or goats left. 
ISA.7.22	Nevertheless, there will be enough milk for everyone because so few people will be left in the land. They will eat their fill of yogurt and honey. 
ISA.7.23	In that day the lush vineyards, now worth 1,000 pieces of silver,
ISA.7.24	The entire land will become a vast expanse of briers and thorns, a hunting ground overrun by wildlife. 
ISA.7.25	No one will go to the fertile hillsides where the gardens once grew, for briers and thorns will cover them. Cattle, sheep, and goats will graze there.
ISA.8.1	Then the 
ISA.8.2	I asked Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah, both known as honest men, to witness my doing this.
ISA.8.3	Then I slept with my wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. And the 
ISA.8.4	For before this child is old enough to say ‘Papa’ or ‘Mama,’ the king of Assyria will carry away both the abundance of Damascus and the riches of Samaria.”
ISA.8.5	Then the 
ISA.8.6	“My care for the people of Judah is like the gently flowing waters of Shiloah, but they have rejected it. They are rejoicing over what will happen to
ISA.8.7	Therefore, the Lord will overwhelm them with a mighty flood from the Euphrates River
ISA.8.8	and sweep into Judah until it is chin deep. It will spread its wings, submerging your land from one end to the other, O Immanuel.
ISA.8.9	“Huddle together, you nations, and be terrified.
ISA.8.9	Listen, all you distant lands.
ISA.8.9	Prepare for battle, but you will be crushed!
ISA.8.9	Yes, prepare for battle, but you will be crushed!
ISA.8.10	Call your councils of war, but they will be worthless.
ISA.8.10	Develop your strategies, but they will not succeed.
ISA.8.10	For God is with us!
ISA.8.11	The 
ISA.8.12	“Don’t call everything a conspiracy, like they do,
ISA.8.12	and don’t live in dread of what frightens them.
ISA.8.13	Make the 
ISA.8.13	He is the one you should fear.
ISA.8.13	He is the one who should make you tremble.
ISA.8.14	He will keep you safe.
ISA.8.14	But to Israel and Judah
ISA.8.14	he will be a stone that makes people stumble,
ISA.8.14	a rock that makes them fall.
ISA.8.14	And for the people of Jerusalem
ISA.8.14	he will be a trap and a snare.
ISA.8.15	Many will stumble and fall,
ISA.8.15	never to rise again.
ISA.8.15	They will be snared and captured.”
ISA.8.16	Preserve the teaching of God;
ISA.8.16	entrust his instructions to those who follow me.
ISA.8.17	I will wait for the 
ISA.8.17	who has turned away from the descendants of Jacob.
ISA.8.17	I will put my hope in him.
ISA.8.18	I and the children the 
ISA.8.19	Someone may say to you, “Let’s ask the mediums and those who consult the spirits of the dead. With their whisperings and mutterings, they will tell us what to do.” But shouldn’t people ask God for guidance? Should the living seek guidance from the dead?
ISA.8.20	Look to God’s instructions and teachings! People who contradict his word are completely in the dark. 
ISA.8.21	They will go from one place to another, weary and hungry. And because they are hungry, they will rage and curse their king and their God. They will look up to heaven 
ISA.8.22	and down at the earth, but wherever they look, there will be trouble and anguish and dark despair. They will be thrown out into the darkness.
ISA.9.1	Nevertheless, that time of darkness and despair will not go on forever. The land of Zebulun and Naphtali will be humbled, but there will be a time in the future when Galilee of the Gentiles, which lies along the road that runs between the Jordan and the sea, will be filled with glory.
ISA.9.2	The people who walk in darkness
ISA.9.2	will see a great light.
ISA.9.2	For those who live in a land of deep darkness,
ISA.9.2	a light will shine.
ISA.9.3	You will enlarge the nation of Israel,
ISA.9.3	and its people will rejoice.
ISA.9.3	They will rejoice before you
ISA.9.3	as people rejoice at the harvest
ISA.9.3	and like warriors dividing the plunder.
ISA.9.4	For you will break the yoke of their slavery
ISA.9.4	and lift the heavy burden from their shoulders.
ISA.9.4	You will break the oppressor’s rod,
ISA.9.4	just as you did when you destroyed the army of Midian.
ISA.9.5	The boots of the warrior
ISA.9.5	and the uniforms bloodstained by war
ISA.9.5	will all be burned.
ISA.9.5	They will be fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.6	For a child is born to us,
ISA.9.6	a son is given to us.
ISA.9.6	The government will rest on his shoulders.
ISA.9.6	And he will be called:
ISA.9.6	Wonderful Counselor,
ISA.9.6	Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
ISA.9.7	His government and its peace
ISA.9.7	will never end.
ISA.9.7	He will rule with fairness and justice from the throne of his ancestor David
ISA.9.7	for all eternity.
ISA.9.7	The passionate commitment of the 
ISA.9.7	will make this happen!
ISA.9.8	The Lord has spoken out against Jacob;
ISA.9.8	his judgment has fallen upon Israel.
ISA.9.9	And the people of Israel
ISA.9.9	who spoke with such pride and arrogance,
ISA.9.9	will soon know it.
ISA.9.10	They said, “We will replace the broken bricks of our ruins with finished stone,
ISA.9.10	and replant the felled sycamore-fig trees with cedars.”
ISA.9.11	But the 
ISA.9.11	and stir up all their foes.
ISA.9.12	The Syrians
ISA.9.12	will bare their fangs and devour Israel.
ISA.9.12	But even then the 
ISA.9.12	His fist is still poised to strike.
ISA.9.13	For after all this punishment, the people will still not repent.
ISA.9.13	They will not seek the 
ISA.9.14	Therefore, in a single day the 
ISA.9.14	the noble palm branch and the lowly reed.
ISA.9.15	The leaders of Israel are the head,
ISA.9.15	and the lying prophets are the tail.
ISA.9.16	For the leaders of the people have misled them.
ISA.9.16	They have led them down the path of destruction.
ISA.9.17	That is why the Lord takes no pleasure in the young men
ISA.9.17	and shows no mercy even to the widows and orphans.
ISA.9.17	For they are all wicked hypocrites,
ISA.9.17	and they all speak foolishness.
ISA.9.17	But even then the 
ISA.9.17	His fist is still poised to strike.
ISA.9.18	This wickedness is like a brushfire.
ISA.9.18	It burns not only briers and thorns
ISA.9.18	but also sets the forests ablaze.
ISA.9.18	Its burning sends up clouds of smoke.
ISA.9.19	The land will be blackened
ISA.9.19	by the fury of the 
ISA.9.19	The people will be fuel for the fire,
ISA.9.19	and no one will spare even his own brother.
ISA.9.20	They will attack their neighbor on the right
ISA.9.20	but will still be hungry.
ISA.9.20	They will devour their neighbor on the left
ISA.9.20	but will not be satisfied.
ISA.9.20	In the end they will even eat their own children.
ISA.9.21	Manasseh will feed on Ephraim,
ISA.9.21	Ephraim will feed on Manasseh,
ISA.9.21	and both will devour Judah.
ISA.9.21	But even then the 
ISA.9.21	His fist is still poised to strike.
ISA.10.1	What sorrow awaits the unjust judges
ISA.10.1	and those who issue unfair laws.
ISA.10.2	They deprive the poor of justice
ISA.10.2	and deny the rights of the needy among my people.
ISA.10.2	They prey on widows
ISA.10.2	and take advantage of orphans.
ISA.10.3	What will you do when I punish you,
ISA.10.3	when I send disaster upon you from a distant land?
ISA.10.3	To whom will you turn for help?
ISA.10.3	Where will your treasures be safe?
ISA.10.4	You will stumble along as prisoners
ISA.10.4	or lie among the dead.
ISA.10.4	But even then the 
ISA.10.4	His fist is still poised to strike.
ISA.10.5	“What sorrow awaits Assyria, the rod of my anger.
ISA.10.5	I use it as a club to express my anger.
ISA.10.6	I am sending Assyria against a godless nation,
ISA.10.6	against a people with whom I am angry.
ISA.10.6	Assyria will plunder them,
ISA.10.6	trampling them like dirt beneath its feet.
ISA.10.7	But the king of Assyria will not understand that he is my tool;
ISA.10.7	his mind does not work that way.
ISA.10.7	His plan is simply to destroy,
ISA.10.7	to cut down nation after nation.
ISA.10.8	He will say,
ISA.10.8	‘Each of my princes will soon be a king.
ISA.10.9	We destroyed Calno just as we did Carchemish.
ISA.10.9	Hamath fell before us as Arpad did.
ISA.10.9	And we destroyed Samaria just as we did Damascus.
ISA.10.10	Yes, we have finished off many a kingdom
ISA.10.10	whose gods were greater than those in Jerusalem and Samaria.
ISA.10.11	So we will defeat Jerusalem and her gods,
ISA.10.11	just as we destroyed Samaria with hers.’”
ISA.10.12	After the Lord has used the king of Assyria to accomplish his purposes on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he will turn against the king of Assyria and punish him—for he is proud and arrogant. 
ISA.10.13	He boasts, 
ISA.10.13	“By my own powerful arm I have done this.
ISA.10.13	With my own shrewd wisdom I planned it.
ISA.10.13	I have broken down the defenses of nations
ISA.10.13	and carried off their treasures.
ISA.10.13	I have knocked down their kings like a bull.
ISA.10.14	I have robbed their nests of riches
ISA.10.14	and gathered up kingdoms as a farmer gathers eggs.
ISA.10.14	No one can even flap a wing against me
ISA.10.14	or utter a peep of protest.”
ISA.10.15	But can the ax boast greater power than the person who uses it?
ISA.10.15	Is the saw greater than the person who saws?
ISA.10.15	Can a rod strike unless a hand moves it?
ISA.10.15	Can a wooden cane walk by itself?
ISA.10.16	Therefore, the Lord, the 
ISA.10.16	will send a plague among Assyria’s proud troops,
ISA.10.16	and a flaming fire will consume its glory.
ISA.10.17	The 
ISA.10.17	the Holy One will be a flame.
ISA.10.17	He will devour the thorns and briers with fire,
ISA.10.17	burning up the enemy in a single night.
ISA.10.18	The 
ISA.10.18	like a fire consumes a forest in a fruitful land;
ISA.10.18	it will waste away like sick people in a plague.
ISA.10.19	Of all that glorious forest, only a few trees will survive—
ISA.10.19	so few that a child could count them!
ISA.10.20	In that day the remnant left in Israel,
ISA.10.20	the survivors in the house of Jacob,
ISA.10.20	will no longer depend on allies
ISA.10.20	who seek to destroy them.
ISA.10.20	But they will faithfully trust the 
ISA.10.20	the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.10.21	A remnant will return;
ISA.10.21	yes, the remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God.
ISA.10.22	But though the people of Israel are as numerous
ISA.10.22	as the sand of the seashore,
ISA.10.22	only a remnant of them will return.
ISA.10.22	The 
ISA.10.23	Yes, the Lord, the 
ISA.10.23	has already decided to destroy the entire land.
ISA.10.24	So this is what the Lord, the 
ISA.10.25	In a little while my anger against you will end, and then my anger will rise up to destroy them.” 
ISA.10.26	The 
ISA.10.27	In that day the 
ISA.10.27	He will break the yoke of slavery
ISA.10.27	and lift it from their shoulders.
ISA.10.28	Look, the Assyrians are now at Aiath.
ISA.10.28	They are passing through Migron
ISA.10.28	and are storing their equipment at Micmash.
ISA.10.29	They are crossing the pass
ISA.10.29	and are camping at Geba.
ISA.10.29	Fear strikes the town of Ramah.
ISA.10.29	All the people of Gibeah, the hometown of Saul,
ISA.10.29	are running for their lives.
ISA.10.30	Scream in terror,
ISA.10.30	you people of Gallim!
ISA.10.30	Shout out a warning to Laishah.
ISA.10.30	Oh, poor Anathoth!
ISA.10.31	There go the people of Madmenah, all fleeing.
ISA.10.31	The citizens of Gebim are trying to hide.
ISA.10.32	The enemy stops at Nob for the rest of that day.
ISA.10.32	He shakes his fist at beautiful Mount Zion, the mountain of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	But look! The Lord, the 
ISA.10.33	will chop down the mighty tree of Assyria with great power!
ISA.10.33	He will cut down the proud.
ISA.10.33	That lofty tree will be brought down.
ISA.10.34	He will cut down the forest trees with an ax.
ISA.10.34	Lebanon will fall to the Mighty One.
ISA.11.1	Out of the stump of David’s family
ISA.11.1	yes, a new Branch bearing fruit from the old root.
ISA.11.2	And the Spirit of the 
ISA.11.2	the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
ISA.11.2	the Spirit of counsel and might,
ISA.11.2	the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the 
ISA.11.3	He will delight in obeying the 
ISA.11.3	He will not judge by appearance
ISA.11.3	nor make a decision based on hearsay.
ISA.11.4	He will give justice to the poor
ISA.11.4	and make fair decisions for the exploited.
ISA.11.4	The earth will shake at the force of his word,
ISA.11.4	and one breath from his mouth will destroy the wicked.
ISA.11.5	He will wear righteousness like a belt
ISA.11.5	and truth like an undergarment.
ISA.11.6	In that day the wolf and the lamb will live together;
ISA.11.6	the leopard will lie down with the baby goat.
ISA.11.6	The calf and the yearling will be safe with the lion,
ISA.11.6	and a little child will lead them all.
ISA.11.7	The cow will graze near the bear.
ISA.11.7	The cub and the calf will lie down together.
ISA.11.7	The lion will eat hay like a cow.
ISA.11.8	The baby will play safely near the hole of a cobra.
ISA.11.8	Yes, a little child will put its hand in a nest of deadly snakes without harm.
ISA.11.9	Nothing will hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain,
ISA.11.9	for as the waters fill the sea,
ISA.11.9	so the earth will be filled with people who know the 
ISA.11.10	In that day the heir to David’s throne
ISA.11.10	will be a banner of salvation to all the world.
ISA.11.10	The nations will rally to him,
ISA.11.10	and the land where he lives will be a glorious place.
ISA.11.11	In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time
ISA.11.11	to bring back the remnant of his people—
ISA.11.11	those who remain in Assyria and northern Egypt;
ISA.11.11	in southern Egypt, Ethiopia,
ISA.11.11	in Babylonia,
ISA.11.12	He will raise a flag among the nations
ISA.11.12	and assemble the exiles of Israel.
ISA.11.12	He will gather the scattered people of Judah
ISA.11.12	from the ends of the earth.
ISA.11.13	Then at last the jealousy between Israel
ISA.11.13	They will not be rivals anymore.
ISA.11.14	They will join forces to swoop down on Philistia to the west.
ISA.11.14	Together they will attack and plunder the nations to the east.
ISA.11.14	They will occupy the lands of Edom and Moab,
ISA.11.14	and Ammon will obey them.
ISA.11.15	The 
ISA.11.15	He will wave his hand over the Euphrates River,
ISA.11.15	sending a mighty wind to divide it into seven streams
ISA.11.15	so it can easily be crossed on foot.
ISA.11.16	He will make a highway for the remnant of his people,
ISA.11.16	the remnant coming from Assyria,
ISA.11.16	just as he did for Israel long ago
ISA.11.16	when they returned from Egypt.
ISA.12.1	In that day you will sing:
ISA.12.1	“I will praise you, O 
ISA.12.1	You were angry with me, but not any more.
ISA.12.1	Now you comfort me.
ISA.12.2	See, God has come to save me.
ISA.12.2	I will trust in him and not be afraid.
ISA.12.2	The 
ISA.12.2	he has given me victory.”
ISA.12.3	With joy you will drink deeply
ISA.12.3	from the fountain of salvation!
ISA.12.4	In that wonderful day you will sing:
ISA.12.4	“Thank the 
ISA.12.4	Tell the nations what he has done.
ISA.12.4	Let them know how mighty he is!
ISA.12.5	Sing to the 
ISA.12.5	Make known his praise around the world.
ISA.12.6	Let all the people of Jerusalem
ISA.12.6	For great is the Holy One of Israel who lives among you.”
ISA.13.1	Isaiah son of Amoz received this message concerning the destruction of Babylon:
ISA.13.2	“Raise a signal flag on a bare hilltop.
ISA.13.2	Call up an army against Babylon.
ISA.13.2	Wave your hand to encourage them
ISA.13.2	as they march into the palaces of the high and mighty.
ISA.13.3	I, the 
ISA.13.3	Yes, I have called mighty warriors to express my anger,
ISA.13.3	and they will rejoice when I am exalted.”
ISA.13.4	Hear the noise on the mountains!
ISA.13.4	Listen, as the vast armies march!
ISA.13.4	It is the noise and shouting of many nations.
ISA.13.4	The 
ISA.13.5	They come from distant countries,
ISA.13.5	from beyond the farthest horizons.
ISA.13.5	They are the 
ISA.13.5	With them he will destroy the whole land.
ISA.13.6	Scream in terror, for the day of the 
ISA.13.6	the time for the Almighty to destroy.
ISA.13.7	Every arm is paralyzed with fear.
ISA.13.7	Every heart melts,
ISA.13.8	and people are terrified.
ISA.13.8	Pangs of anguish grip them,
ISA.13.8	like those of a woman in labor.
ISA.13.8	They look helplessly at one another,
ISA.13.8	their faces aflame with fear.
ISA.13.9	For see, the day of the 
ISA.13.9	the terrible day of his fury and fierce anger.
ISA.13.9	The land will be made desolate,
ISA.13.9	and all the sinners destroyed with it.
ISA.13.10	The heavens will be black above them;
ISA.13.10	the stars will give no light.
ISA.13.10	The sun will be dark when it rises,
ISA.13.10	and the moon will provide no light.
ISA.13.11	“I, the 
ISA.13.11	and the wicked for their sin.
ISA.13.11	I will crush the arrogance of the proud
ISA.13.11	and humble the pride of the mighty.
ISA.13.12	I will make people scarcer than gold—
ISA.13.12	more rare than the fine gold of Ophir.
ISA.13.13	For I will shake the heavens.
ISA.13.13	The earth will move from its place
ISA.13.13	when the 
ISA.13.13	in the day of his fierce anger.”
ISA.13.14	Everyone in Babylon will run about like a hunted gazelle,
ISA.13.14	like sheep without a shepherd.
ISA.13.14	They will try to find their own people
ISA.13.14	and flee to their own land.
ISA.13.15	Anyone who is captured will be cut down—
ISA.13.15	run through with a sword.
ISA.13.16	Their little children will be dashed to death before their eyes.
ISA.13.16	Their homes will be sacked, and their wives will be raped.
ISA.13.17	“Look, I will stir up the Medes against Babylon.
ISA.13.17	They cannot be tempted by silver
ISA.13.17	or bribed with gold.
ISA.13.18	The attacking armies will shoot down the young men with arrows.
ISA.13.18	They will have no mercy on helpless babies
ISA.13.18	and will show no compassion for children.”
ISA.13.19	Babylon, the most glorious of kingdoms,
ISA.13.19	the flower of Chaldean pride,
ISA.13.19	will be devastated like Sodom and Gomorrah
ISA.13.19	when God destroyed them.
ISA.13.20	Babylon will never be inhabited again.
ISA.13.20	It will remain empty for generation after generation.
ISA.13.20	Nomads will refuse to camp there,
ISA.13.20	and shepherds will not bed down their sheep.
ISA.13.21	Desert animals will move into the ruined city,
ISA.13.21	and the houses will be haunted by howling creatures.
ISA.13.21	Owls will live among the ruins,
ISA.13.21	and wild goats will go there to dance.
ISA.13.22	Hyenas will howl in its fortresses,
ISA.13.22	and jackals will make dens in its luxurious palaces.
ISA.13.22	Babylon’s days are numbered;
ISA.13.22	its time of destruction will soon arrive.
ISA.14.1	But the 
ISA.14.2	The nations of the world will help the people of Israel to return, and those who come to live in the 
ISA.14.3	In that wonderful day when the 
ISA.14.4	you will taunt the king of Babylon. You will say,
ISA.14.4	“The mighty man has been destroyed.
ISA.14.4	Yes, your insolence
ISA.14.5	For the 
ISA.14.5	and broken your evil rule.
ISA.14.6	You struck the people with endless blows of rage
ISA.14.6	and held the nations in your angry grip
ISA.14.6	with unrelenting tyranny.
ISA.14.7	But finally the earth is at rest and quiet.
ISA.14.7	Now it can sing again!
ISA.14.8	Even the trees of the forest—
ISA.14.8	the cypress trees and the cedars of Lebanon—
ISA.14.8	sing out this joyous song:
ISA.14.8	‘Since you have been cut down,
ISA.14.8	no one will come now to cut us down!’
ISA.14.9	“In the place of the dead
ISA.14.9	over your arrival.
ISA.14.9	The spirits of world leaders and mighty kings long dead
ISA.14.9	stand up to see you.
ISA.14.10	With one voice they all cry out,
ISA.14.10	‘Now you are as weak as we are!
ISA.14.11	Your might and power were buried with you.
ISA.14.11	The sound of the harp in your palace has ceased.
ISA.14.11	Now maggots are your sheet,
ISA.14.11	and worms your blanket.’
ISA.14.12	“How you are fallen from heaven,
ISA.14.12	O shining star, son of the morning!
ISA.14.12	You have been thrown down to the earth,
ISA.14.12	you who destroyed the nations of the world.
ISA.14.13	For you said to yourself,
ISA.14.13	‘I will ascend to heaven and set my throne above God’s stars.
ISA.14.13	I will preside on the mountain of the gods
ISA.14.13	far away in the north.
ISA.14.14	I will climb to the highest heavens
ISA.14.14	and be like the Most High.’
ISA.14.15	Instead, you will be brought down to the place of the dead,
ISA.14.15	down to its lowest depths.
ISA.14.16	Everyone there will stare at you and ask,
ISA.14.16	‘Can this be the one who shook the earth
ISA.14.16	and made the kingdoms of the world tremble?
ISA.14.17	Is this the one who destroyed the world
ISA.14.17	and made it into a wasteland?
ISA.14.17	Is this the king who demolished the world’s greatest cities
ISA.14.17	and had no mercy on his prisoners?’
ISA.14.18	“The kings of the nations lie in stately glory,
ISA.14.18	each in his own tomb,
ISA.14.19	but you will be thrown out of your grave
ISA.14.19	like a worthless branch.
ISA.14.19	Like a corpse trampled underfoot,
ISA.14.19	you will be dumped into a mass grave
ISA.14.19	with those killed in battle.
ISA.14.19	You will descend to the pit.
ISA.14.20	You will not be given a proper burial,
ISA.14.20	for you have destroyed your nation
ISA.14.20	and slaughtered your people.
ISA.14.20	The descendants of such an evil person
ISA.14.20	will never again receive honor.
ISA.14.21	Kill this man’s children!
ISA.14.21	Let them die because of their father’s sins!
ISA.14.21	They must not rise and conquer the earth,
ISA.14.21	filling the world with their cities.”
ISA.14.22	This is what the 
ISA.14.22	“I, myself, have risen against Babylon!
ISA.14.22	I will destroy its children and its children’s children,”
ISA.14.22	says the 
ISA.14.23	“I will make Babylon a desolate place of owls,
ISA.14.23	filled with swamps and marshes.
ISA.14.23	I will sweep the land with the broom of destruction.
ISA.14.23	I, the 
ISA.14.24	The 
ISA.14.24	“It will all happen as I have planned.
ISA.14.24	It will be as I have decided.
ISA.14.25	I will break the Assyrians when they are in Israel;
ISA.14.25	I will trample them on my mountains.
ISA.14.25	My people will no longer be their slaves
ISA.14.25	nor bow down under their heavy loads.
ISA.14.26	I have a plan for the whole earth,
ISA.14.26	a hand of judgment upon all the nations.
ISA.14.27	The 
ISA.14.27	who can change his plans?
ISA.14.27	When his hand is raised,
ISA.14.27	who can stop him?”
ISA.14.28	This message came to me the year King Ahaz died:
ISA.14.29	Do not rejoice, you Philistines,
ISA.14.29	that the rod that struck you is broken—
ISA.14.29	that the king who attacked you is dead.
ISA.14.29	For from that snake a more poisonous snake will be born,
ISA.14.29	a fiery serpent to destroy you!
ISA.14.30	I will feed the poor in my pasture;
ISA.14.30	the needy will lie down in peace.
ISA.14.30	But as for you, I will wipe you out with famine
ISA.14.30	and destroy the few who remain.
ISA.14.31	Wail at the gates! Weep in the cities!
ISA.14.31	Melt with fear, you Philistines!
ISA.14.31	A powerful army comes like smoke from the north.
ISA.14.31	Each soldier rushes forward eager to fight.
ISA.14.32	What should we tell the Philistine messengers? Tell them, 
ISA.14.32	“The 
ISA.14.32	its walls will give refuge to his oppressed people.”
ISA.15.1	This message came to me concerning Moab:
ISA.15.1	In one night the town of Ar will be leveled,
ISA.15.1	and the city of Kir will be destroyed.
ISA.15.2	Your people will go to their temple in Dibon to mourn.
ISA.15.2	They will go to their sacred shrines to weep.
ISA.15.2	They will wail for the fate of Nebo and Medeba,
ISA.15.2	shaving their heads in sorrow and cutting off their beards.
ISA.15.3	They will wear burlap as they wander the streets.
ISA.15.3	From every home and public square will come the sound of wailing.
ISA.15.4	The people of Heshbon and Elealeh will cry out;
ISA.15.4	their voices will be heard as far away as Jahaz!
ISA.15.4	The bravest warriors of Moab will cry out in utter terror.
ISA.15.4	They will be helpless with fear.
ISA.15.5	My heart weeps for Moab.
ISA.15.5	Its people flee to Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah.
ISA.15.5	Weeping, they climb the road to Luhith.
ISA.15.5	Their cries of distress can be heard all along the road to Horonaim.
ISA.15.6	Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up!
ISA.15.6	The grassy banks are scorched.
ISA.15.6	The tender plants are gone;
ISA.15.6	nothing green remains.
ISA.15.7	The people grab their possessions
ISA.15.7	and carry them across the Ravine of Willows.
ISA.15.8	A cry of distress echoes through the land of Moab
ISA.15.8	from one end to the other—
ISA.15.8	from Eglaim to Beer-elim.
ISA.15.9	The stream near Dibon
ISA.15.9	but I am still not finished with Dibon!
ISA.15.9	Lions will hunt down the survivors—
ISA.15.9	both those who try to escape
ISA.15.9	and those who remain behind.
ISA.16.1	Send lambs from Sela as tribute
ISA.16.1	to the ruler of the land.
ISA.16.1	Send them through the desert
ISA.16.1	to the mountain of beautiful Zion.
ISA.16.2	The women of Moab are left like homeless birds
ISA.16.2	at the shallow crossings of the Arnon River.
ISA.16.3	“Help us,” they cry.
ISA.16.3	“Defend us against our enemies.
ISA.16.3	Protect us from their relentless attack.
ISA.16.3	Do not betray us now that we have escaped.
ISA.16.4	Let our refugees stay among you.
ISA.16.4	Hide them from our enemies until the terror is past.”
ISA.16.4	When oppression and destruction have ended
ISA.16.4	and enemy raiders have disappeared,
ISA.16.5	then God will establish one of David’s descendants as king.
ISA.16.5	He will rule with mercy and truth.
ISA.16.5	He will always do what is just
ISA.16.5	and be eager to do what is right.
ISA.16.6	We have heard about proud Moab—
ISA.16.6	about its pride and arrogance and rage.
ISA.16.6	But all that boasting has disappeared.
ISA.16.7	The entire land of Moab weeps.
ISA.16.7	Yes, everyone in Moab mourns
ISA.16.7	for the cakes of raisins from Kir-hareseth.
ISA.16.7	They are all gone now.
ISA.16.8	The farms of Heshbon are abandoned;
ISA.16.8	the vineyards at Sibmah are deserted.
ISA.16.8	The rulers of the nations have broken down Moab—
ISA.16.8	that beautiful grapevine.
ISA.16.8	Its tendrils spread north as far as the town of Jazer
ISA.16.8	and trailed eastward into the wilderness.
ISA.16.8	Its shoots reached so far west
ISA.16.8	that they crossed over the Dead Sea.
ISA.16.9	So now I weep for Jazer and the vineyards of Sibmah;
ISA.16.9	my tears will flow for Heshbon and Elealeh.
ISA.16.9	There are no more shouts of joy
ISA.16.9	over your summer fruits and harvest.
ISA.16.10	Gone now is the gladness,
ISA.16.10	gone the joy of harvest.
ISA.16.10	There will be no singing in the vineyards,
ISA.16.10	no more happy shouts,
ISA.16.10	no treading of grapes in the winepresses.
ISA.16.10	I have ended all their harvest joys.
ISA.16.11	My heart’s cry for Moab is like a lament on a harp.
ISA.16.11	I am filled with anguish for Kir-hareseth.
ISA.16.12	The people of Moab will worship at their pagan shrines,
ISA.16.12	but it will do them no good.
ISA.16.12	They will cry to the gods in their temples,
ISA.16.12	but no one will be able to save them.
ISA.16.13	The 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	This message came to me concerning Damascus: 
ISA.17.1	“Look, the city of Damascus will disappear!
ISA.17.1	It will become a heap of ruins.
ISA.17.2	The towns of Aroer will be deserted.
ISA.17.2	Flocks will graze in the streets and lie down undisturbed,
ISA.17.2	with no one to chase them away.
ISA.17.3	The fortified towns of Israel
ISA.17.3	and the royal power of Damascus will end.
ISA.17.3	All that remains of Syria
ISA.17.3	will share the fate of Israel’s departed glory,”
ISA.17.3	declares the 
ISA.17.4	“In that day Israel’s
ISA.17.4	its robust body will waste away.
ISA.17.5	The whole land will look like a grainfield
ISA.17.5	after the harvesters have gathered the grain.
ISA.17.5	It will be desolate,
ISA.17.5	like the fields in the valley of Rephaim after the harvest.
ISA.17.6	Only a few of its people will be left,
ISA.17.6	like stray olives left on a tree after the harvest.
ISA.17.6	Only two or three remain in the highest branches,
ISA.17.6	four or five scattered here and there on the limbs,”
ISA.17.6	declares the 
ISA.17.7	Then at last the people will look to their Creator
ISA.17.7	and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.17.8	They will no longer look to their idols for help
ISA.17.8	or worship what their own hands have made.
ISA.17.8	They will never again bow down to their Asherah poles
ISA.17.8	or worship at the pagan shrines they have built.
ISA.17.9	Their largest cities will be like a deserted forest,
ISA.17.9	like the land the Hivites and Amorites abandoned
ISA.17.9	when the Israelites came here so long ago.
ISA.17.9	It will be utterly desolate.
ISA.17.10	Why? Because you have turned from the God who can save you.
ISA.17.10	You have forgotten the Rock who can hide you.
ISA.17.10	So you may plant the finest grapevines
ISA.17.10	and import the most expensive seedlings.
ISA.17.11	They may sprout on the day you set them out;
ISA.17.11	yes, they may blossom on the very morning you plant them,
ISA.17.11	but you will never pick any grapes from them.
ISA.17.11	Your only harvest will be a load of grief and unrelieved pain.
ISA.17.12	Listen! The armies of many nations
ISA.17.12	roar like the roaring of the sea.
ISA.17.12	Hear the thunder of the mighty forces
ISA.17.12	as they rush forward like thundering waves.
ISA.17.13	But though they thunder like breakers on a beach,
ISA.17.13	God will silence them, and they will run away.
ISA.17.13	They will flee like chaff scattered by the wind,
ISA.17.13	like a tumbleweed whirling before a storm.
ISA.17.14	In the evening Israel waits in terror,
ISA.17.14	but by dawn its enemies are dead.
ISA.17.14	This is the just reward of those who plunder us,
ISA.17.14	a fitting end for those who destroy us.
ISA.18.1	Listen, Ethiopia
ISA.18.1	that lies at the headwaters of the Nile,
ISA.18.2	that sends ambassadors
ISA.18.2	in swift boats down the river.
ISA.18.2	Go, swift messengers!
ISA.18.2	Take a message to a tall, smooth-skinned people,
ISA.18.2	who are feared far and wide
ISA.18.2	for their conquests and destruction,
ISA.18.2	and whose land is divided by rivers.
ISA.18.3	All you people of the world,
ISA.18.3	everyone who lives on the earth—
ISA.18.3	when I raise my battle flag on the mountain, look!
ISA.18.3	When I blow the ram’s horn, listen!
ISA.18.4	For the 
ISA.18.4	“I will watch quietly from my dwelling place—
ISA.18.4	as quietly as the heat rises on a summer day,
ISA.18.4	or as the morning dew forms during the harvest.”
ISA.18.5	Even before you begin your attack,
ISA.18.5	while your plans are ripening like grapes,
ISA.18.5	the 
ISA.18.5	He will snip off and discard your spreading branches.
ISA.18.6	Your mighty army will be left dead in the fields
ISA.18.6	for the mountain vultures and wild animals.
ISA.18.6	The vultures will tear at the corpses all summer.
ISA.18.6	The wild animals will gnaw at the bones all winter.
ISA.18.7	At that time the 
ISA.18.7	from this land divided by rivers,
ISA.18.7	from this tall, smooth-skinned people,
ISA.18.7	who are feared far and wide for their conquests and destruction.
ISA.18.7	They will bring the gifts to Jerusalem,
ISA.18.7	where the 
ISA.19.1	This message came to me concerning Egypt:
ISA.19.1	Look! The 
ISA.19.1	riding on a swift cloud.
ISA.19.1	The idols of Egypt tremble.
ISA.19.1	The hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear.
ISA.19.2	“I will make Egyptian fight against Egyptian—
ISA.19.2	brother against brother,
ISA.19.2	neighbor against neighbor,
ISA.19.2	city against city,
ISA.19.2	province against province.
ISA.19.3	The Egyptians will lose heart,
ISA.19.3	and I will confuse their plans.
ISA.19.3	They will plead with their idols for wisdom
ISA.19.3	and call on spirits, mediums, and those who consult the spirits of the dead.
ISA.19.4	I will hand Egypt over
ISA.19.4	to a hard, cruel master.
ISA.19.4	A fierce king will rule them,”
ISA.19.4	says the Lord, the 
ISA.19.5	The waters of the Nile will fail to rise and flood the fields.
ISA.19.5	The riverbed will be parched and dry.
ISA.19.6	The canals of the Nile will dry up,
ISA.19.6	and the streams of Egypt will stink
ISA.19.6	with rotting reeds and rushes.
ISA.19.7	All the greenery along the riverbank
ISA.19.7	and all the crops along the river
ISA.19.7	will dry up and blow away.
ISA.19.8	The fishermen will lament for lack of work.
ISA.19.8	Those who cast hooks into the Nile will groan,
ISA.19.8	and those who use nets will lose heart.
ISA.19.9	There will be no flax for the harvesters,
ISA.19.9	no thread for the weavers.
ISA.19.10	They will be in despair,
ISA.19.10	and all the workers will be sick at heart.
ISA.19.11	What fools are the officials of Zoan!
ISA.19.11	Their best counsel to the king of Egypt is stupid and wrong.
ISA.19.11	Will they still boast to Pharaoh of their wisdom?
ISA.19.11	Will they dare brag about all their wise ancestors?
ISA.19.12	Where are your wise counselors, Pharaoh?
ISA.19.12	Let them tell you what God plans,
ISA.19.12	what the 
ISA.19.13	The officials of Zoan are fools,
ISA.19.13	and the officials of Memphis
ISA.19.13	The leaders of the people
ISA.19.13	have led Egypt astray.
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.14	so all their suggestions are wrong.
ISA.19.14	They cause Egypt to stagger
ISA.19.14	like a drunk in his vomit.
ISA.19.15	There is nothing Egypt can do.
ISA.19.15	All are helpless—
ISA.19.15	the head and the tail,
ISA.19.15	the noble palm branch and the lowly reed.
ISA.19.16	In that day the Egyptians will be as weak as women. They will cower in fear beneath the upraised fist of the 
ISA.19.17	Just to speak the name of Israel will terrorize them, for the 
ISA.19.18	In that day five of Egypt’s cities will follow the 
ISA.19.19	In that day there will be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	It will be a sign and a witness that the 
ISA.19.21	The 
ISA.19.22	The 
ISA.19.23	In that day Egypt and Assyria will be connected by a highway. The Egyptians and Assyrians will move freely between their lands, and they will both worship God. 
ISA.19.24	In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth. 
ISA.19.25	For the 
ISA.20.1	In the year when King Sargon of Assyria sent his commander in chief to capture the Philistine city of Ashdod,
ISA.20.2	the 
ISA.20.3	Then the 
ISA.20.4	For the king of Assyria will take away the Egyptians and Ethiopians
ISA.20.5	Then the Philistines will be thrown into panic, for they counted on the power of Ethiopia and boasted of their allies in Egypt! 
ISA.20.6	They will say, ‘If this can happen to Egypt, what chance do we have? We were counting on Egypt to protect us from the king of Assyria.’”
ISA.21.1	This message came to me concerning Babylon—the desert by the sea
ISA.21.1	Disaster is roaring down on you from the desert,
ISA.21.1	like a whirlwind sweeping in from the Negev.
ISA.21.2	I see a terrifying vision:
ISA.21.2	I see the betrayer betraying,
ISA.21.2	the destroyer destroying.
ISA.21.2	Go ahead, you Elamites and Medes,
ISA.21.2	attack and lay siege.
ISA.21.2	I will make an end
ISA.21.2	to all the groaning Babylon caused.
ISA.21.3	My stomach aches and burns with pain.
ISA.21.3	Sharp pangs of anguish are upon me,
ISA.21.3	like those of a woman in labor.
ISA.21.3	I grow faint when I hear what God is planning;
ISA.21.3	I am too afraid to look.
ISA.21.4	My mind reels and my heart races.
ISA.21.4	I longed for evening to come,
ISA.21.4	but now I am terrified of the dark.
ISA.21.5	Look! They are preparing a great feast.
ISA.21.5	They are spreading rugs for people to sit on.
ISA.21.5	Everyone is eating and drinking.
ISA.21.5	But quick! Grab your shields and prepare for battle.
ISA.21.5	You are being attacked!
ISA.21.6	Meanwhile, the Lord said to me,
ISA.21.6	“Put a watchman on the city wall.
ISA.21.6	Let him shout out what he sees.
ISA.21.7	He should look for chariots
ISA.21.7	drawn by pairs of horses,
ISA.21.7	and for riders on donkeys and camels.
ISA.21.7	Let the watchman be fully alert.”
ISA.21.8	Then the watchman
ISA.21.8	“Day after day I have stood on the watchtower, my lord.
ISA.21.8	Night after night I have remained at my post.
ISA.21.9	Now at last—look!
ISA.21.9	Here comes a man in a chariot
ISA.21.9	with a pair of horses!”
ISA.21.9	Then the watchman said,
ISA.21.9	“Babylon is fallen, fallen!
ISA.21.9	All the idols of Babylon
ISA.21.9	lie broken on the ground!”
ISA.21.10	O my people, threshed and winnowed,
ISA.21.10	I have told you everything the 
ISA.21.10	everything the God of Israel has told me.
ISA.21.11	This message came to me concerning Edom
ISA.21.11	Someone from Edom
ISA.21.11	“Watchman, how much longer until morning?
ISA.21.11	When will the night be over?”
ISA.21.12	The watchman replies,
ISA.21.12	“Morning is coming, but night will soon return.
ISA.21.12	If you wish to ask again, then come back and ask.”
ISA.21.13	This message came to me concerning Arabia:
ISA.21.13	O caravans from Dedan,
ISA.21.13	hide in the deserts of Arabia.
ISA.21.14	O people of Tema,
ISA.21.14	bring water to these thirsty people,
ISA.21.14	food to these weary refugees.
ISA.21.15	They have fled from the sword,
ISA.21.15	from the drawn sword,
ISA.21.15	from the bent bow
ISA.21.15	and the terrors of battle.
ISA.21.16	The Lord said to me, “Within a year, counting each day,
ISA.21.17	Only a few of its courageous archers will survive. I, the 
ISA.22.1	This message came to me concerning Jerusalem—the Valley of Vision
ISA.22.1	What is happening?
ISA.22.1	Why is everyone running to the rooftops?
ISA.22.2	The whole city is in a terrible uproar.
ISA.22.2	What do I see in this reveling city?
ISA.22.2	Bodies are lying everywhere,
ISA.22.2	killed not in battle but by famine and disease.
ISA.22.3	All your leaders have fled.
ISA.22.3	They surrendered without resistance.
ISA.22.3	The people tried to slip away,
ISA.22.3	but they were captured, too.
ISA.22.4	That’s why I said, “Leave me alone to weep;
ISA.22.4	do not try to comfort me.
ISA.22.4	Let me cry for my people
ISA.22.4	as I watch them being destroyed.”
ISA.22.5	Oh, what a day of crushing defeat!
ISA.22.5	What a day of confusion and terror
ISA.22.5	brought by the Lord, the 
ISA.22.5	upon the Valley of Vision!
ISA.22.5	The walls of Jerusalem have been broken,
ISA.22.5	and cries of death echo from the mountainsides.
ISA.22.6	Elamites are the archers,
ISA.22.6	with their chariots and charioteers.
ISA.22.6	The men of Kir hold up the shields.
ISA.22.7	Chariots fill your beautiful valleys,
ISA.22.7	and charioteers storm your gates.
ISA.22.8	Judah’s defenses have been stripped away.
ISA.22.8	You run to the armory
ISA.22.9	You inspect the breaks in the walls of Jerusalem.
ISA.22.9	You store up water in the lower pool.
ISA.22.10	You survey the houses and tear some down
ISA.22.10	for stone to strengthen the walls.
ISA.22.11	Between the city walls, you build a reservoir
ISA.22.11	for water from the old pool.
ISA.22.11	But you never ask for help from the One who did all this.
ISA.22.11	You never considered the One who planned this long ago.
ISA.22.12	At that time the Lord, the 
ISA.22.12	called you to weep and mourn.
ISA.22.12	He told you to shave your heads in sorrow for your sins
ISA.22.12	and to wear clothes of burlap to show your remorse.
ISA.22.13	But instead, you dance and play;
ISA.22.13	you slaughter cattle and kill sheep.
ISA.22.13	You feast on meat and drink wine.
ISA.22.13	You say, “Let’s feast and drink,
ISA.22.13	for tomorrow we die!”
ISA.22.14	The 
ISA.22.15	This is what the Lord, the 
ISA.22.16	“Who do you think you are,
ISA.22.16	and what are you doing here,
ISA.22.16	building a beautiful tomb for yourself—
ISA.22.16	a monument high up in the rock?
ISA.22.17	For the 
ISA.22.17	He is going to grab you,
ISA.22.18	crumple you into a ball,
ISA.22.18	and toss you away into a distant, barren land.
ISA.22.18	There you will die,
ISA.22.18	and your glorious chariots will be broken and useless.
ISA.22.18	You are a disgrace to your master!
ISA.22.19	“Yes, I will drive you out of office,” says the 
ISA.22.20	And then I will call my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah to replace you. 
ISA.22.21	I will dress him in your royal robes and will give him your title and your authority. And he will be a father to the people of Jerusalem and Judah. 
ISA.22.22	I will give him the key to the house of David—the highest position in the royal court. When he opens doors, no one will be able to close them; when he closes doors, no one will be able to open them. 
ISA.22.23	He will bring honor to his family name, for I will drive him firmly in place like a nail in the wall. 
ISA.22.24	They will give him great responsibility, and he will bring honor to even the lowliest members of his family.
ISA.22.25	But the 
ISA.23.1	This message came to me concerning Tyre:
ISA.23.1	Wail, you trading ships of Tarshish,
ISA.23.1	for the harbor and houses of Tyre are gone!
ISA.23.1	The rumors you heard in Cyprus
ISA.23.1	are all true.
ISA.23.2	Mourn in silence, you people of the coast
ISA.23.2	and you merchants of Sidon.
ISA.23.2	Your traders crossed the sea,
ISA.23.3	sailing over deep waters.
ISA.23.3	They brought you grain from Egypt
ISA.23.3	and harvests from along the Nile.
ISA.23.3	You were the marketplace of the world.
ISA.23.4	But now you are put to shame, city of Sidon,
ISA.23.4	for Tyre, the fortress of the sea, says,
ISA.23.4	“Now I am childless;
ISA.23.4	I have no sons or daughters.”
ISA.23.5	When Egypt hears the news about Tyre,
ISA.23.5	there will be great sorrow.
ISA.23.6	Send word now to Tarshish!
ISA.23.6	Wail, you people who live in distant lands!
ISA.23.7	Is this silent ruin all that is left of your once joyous city?
ISA.23.7	What a long history was yours!
ISA.23.7	Think of all the colonists you sent to distant places.
ISA.23.8	Who has brought this disaster on Tyre,
ISA.23.8	that great creator of kingdoms?
ISA.23.8	Her traders were all princes,
ISA.23.8	her merchants were nobles.
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.9	to destroy your pride
ISA.23.9	and bring low all earth’s nobility.
ISA.23.10	Come, people of Tarshish,
ISA.23.10	sweep over the land like the flooding Nile,
ISA.23.10	for Tyre is defenseless.
ISA.23.11	The 
ISA.23.11	and shook the kingdoms of the earth.
ISA.23.11	He has spoken out against Phoenicia,
ISA.23.11	ordering that her fortresses be destroyed.
ISA.23.12	He says, “Never again will you rejoice,
ISA.23.12	O daughter of Sidon, for you have been crushed.
ISA.23.12	Even if you flee to Cyprus,
ISA.23.12	you will find no rest.”
ISA.23.13	Look at the land of Babylonia
ISA.23.13	the people of that land are gone!
ISA.23.13	The Assyrians have handed Babylon over
ISA.23.13	to the wild animals of the desert.
ISA.23.13	They have built siege ramps against its walls,
ISA.23.13	torn down its palaces,
ISA.23.13	and turned it to a heap of rubble.
ISA.23.14	Wail, you ships of Tarshish,
ISA.23.14	for your harbor is destroyed!
ISA.23.15	For seventy years, the length of a king’s life, Tyre will be forgotten. But then the city will come back to life as in the song about the prostitute:
ISA.23.16	Take a harp and walk the streets,
ISA.23.16	you forgotten harlot.
ISA.23.16	Make sweet melody and sing your songs
ISA.23.16	so you will be remembered again.
ISA.23.17	Yes, after seventy years the 
ISA.23.18	But in the end her profits will be given to the 
ISA.24.1	Look! The 
ISA.24.1	and make it a vast wasteland.
ISA.24.1	He devastates the surface of the earth
ISA.24.1	and scatters the people.
ISA.24.2	Priests and laypeople,
ISA.24.2	servants and masters,
ISA.24.2	maids and mistresses,
ISA.24.2	buyers and sellers,
ISA.24.2	lenders and borrowers,
ISA.24.2	bankers and debtors—none will be spared.
ISA.24.3	The earth will be completely emptied and looted.
ISA.24.3	The 
ISA.24.4	The earth mourns and dries up,
ISA.24.4	and the land wastes away and withers.
ISA.24.4	Even the greatest people on earth waste away.
ISA.24.5	The earth suffers for the sins of its people,
ISA.24.5	for they have twisted God’s instructions,
ISA.24.5	violated his laws,
ISA.24.5	and broken his everlasting covenant.
ISA.24.6	Therefore, a curse consumes the earth.
ISA.24.6	Its people must pay the price for their sin.
ISA.24.6	They are destroyed by fire,
ISA.24.6	and only a few are left alive.
ISA.24.7	The grapevines waste away,
ISA.24.7	and there is no new wine.
ISA.24.7	All the merrymakers sigh and mourn.
ISA.24.8	The cheerful sound of tambourines is stilled;
ISA.24.8	the happy cries of celebration are heard no more.
ISA.24.8	The melodious chords of the harp are silent.
ISA.24.9	Gone are the joys of wine and song;
ISA.24.9	alcoholic drink turns bitter in the mouth.
ISA.24.10	The city writhes in chaos;
ISA.24.10	every home is locked to keep out intruders.
ISA.24.11	Mobs gather in the streets, crying out for wine.
ISA.24.11	Joy has turned to gloom.
ISA.24.11	Gladness has been banished from the land.
ISA.24.12	The city is left in ruins,
ISA.24.12	its gates battered down.
ISA.24.13	Throughout the earth the story is the same—
ISA.24.13	only a remnant is left,
ISA.24.13	like the stray olives left on the tree
ISA.24.13	or the few grapes left on the vine after harvest.
ISA.24.14	But all who are left shout and sing for joy.
ISA.24.14	Those in the west praise the 
ISA.24.15	In eastern lands, give glory to the 
ISA.24.15	In the lands beyond the sea, praise the name of the 
ISA.24.16	We hear songs of praise from the ends of the earth,
ISA.24.16	songs that give glory to the Righteous One!
ISA.24.16	But my heart is heavy with grief.
ISA.24.16	Weep for me, for I wither away.
ISA.24.16	Deceit still prevails,
ISA.24.16	and treachery is everywhere.
ISA.24.17	Terror and traps and snares will be your lot,
ISA.24.17	you people of the earth.
ISA.24.18	Those who flee in terror will fall into a trap,
ISA.24.18	and those who escape the trap will be caught in a snare.
ISA.24.18	Destruction falls like rain from the heavens;
ISA.24.18	the foundations of the earth shake.
ISA.24.19	The earth has broken up.
ISA.24.19	It has utterly collapsed;
ISA.24.19	it is violently shaken.
ISA.24.20	The earth staggers like a drunk.
ISA.24.20	It trembles like a tent in a storm.
ISA.24.20	It falls and will not rise again,
ISA.24.20	for the guilt of its rebellion is very heavy.
ISA.24.21	In that day the 
ISA.24.21	and the proud rulers of the nations on earth.
ISA.24.22	They will be rounded up and put in prison.
ISA.24.22	They will be shut up in prison
ISA.24.22	and will finally be punished.
ISA.24.23	Then the glory of the moon will wane,
ISA.24.23	and the brightness of the sun will fade,
ISA.24.23	for the 
ISA.24.23	He will rule in great glory in Jerusalem,
ISA.24.23	in the sight of all the leaders of his people.
ISA.25.1	O 
ISA.25.1	for you are my God.
ISA.25.1	You do such wonderful things!
ISA.25.1	You planned them long ago,
ISA.25.1	and now you have accomplished them.
ISA.25.2	You turn mighty cities into heaps of ruins.
ISA.25.2	Cities with strong walls are turned to rubble.
ISA.25.2	Beautiful palaces in distant lands disappear
ISA.25.2	and will never be rebuilt.
ISA.25.3	Therefore, strong nations will declare your glory;
ISA.25.3	ruthless nations will fear you.
ISA.25.4	But you are a tower of refuge to the poor, O 
ISA.25.4	a tower of refuge to the needy in distress.
ISA.25.4	You are a refuge from the storm
ISA.25.4	and a shelter from the heat.
ISA.25.4	For the oppressive acts of ruthless people
ISA.25.4	are like a storm beating against a wall,
ISA.25.5	or like the relentless heat of the desert.
ISA.25.5	But you silence the roar of foreign nations.
ISA.25.5	As the shade of a cloud cools relentless heat,
ISA.25.5	so the boastful songs of ruthless people are stilled.
ISA.25.6	In Jerusalem,
ISA.25.6	will spread a wonderful feast
ISA.25.6	for all the people of the world.
ISA.25.6	It will be a delicious banquet
ISA.25.6	with clear, well-aged wine and choice meat.
ISA.25.7	There he will remove the cloud of gloom,
ISA.25.7	the shadow of death that hangs over the earth.
ISA.25.8	He will swallow up death forever!
ISA.25.8	The Sovereign 
ISA.25.8	He will remove forever all insults and mockery
ISA.25.8	against his land and people.
ISA.25.8	The 
ISA.25.9	In that day the people will proclaim,
ISA.25.9	“This is our God!
ISA.25.9	We trusted in him, and he saved us!
ISA.25.9	This is the 
ISA.25.9	Let us rejoice in the salvation he brings!”
ISA.25.10	For the 
ISA.25.10	But Moab will be crushed.
ISA.25.10	It will be like straw trampled down and left to rot.
ISA.25.11	God will push down Moab’s people
ISA.25.11	as a swimmer pushes down water with his hands.
ISA.25.11	He will end their pride
ISA.25.11	and all their evil works.
ISA.25.12	The high walls of Moab will be demolished.
ISA.25.12	They will be brought down to the ground,
ISA.25.12	down into the dust.
ISA.26.1	In that day, everyone in the land of Judah will sing this song:
ISA.26.1	Our city is strong!
ISA.26.1	We are surrounded by the walls of God’s salvation.
ISA.26.2	Open the gates to all who are righteous;
ISA.26.2	allow the faithful to enter.
ISA.26.3	You will keep in perfect peace
ISA.26.3	all who trust in you,
ISA.26.3	all whose thoughts are fixed on you!
ISA.26.4	Trust in the 
ISA.26.4	for the 
ISA.26.5	He humbles the proud
ISA.26.5	and brings down the arrogant city.
ISA.26.5	He brings it down to the dust.
ISA.26.6	The poor and oppressed trample it underfoot,
ISA.26.6	and the needy walk all over it.
ISA.26.7	But for those who are righteous,
ISA.26.7	the way is not steep and rough.
ISA.26.7	You are a God who does what is right,
ISA.26.7	and you smooth out the path ahead of them.
ISA.26.8	, we show our trust in you by obeying your laws;
ISA.26.8	our heart’s desire is to glorify your name.
ISA.26.9	In the night I search for you;
ISA.26.9	in the morning
ISA.26.9	For only when you come to judge the earth
ISA.26.9	will people learn what is right.
ISA.26.10	Your kindness to the wicked
ISA.26.10	does not make them do good.
ISA.26.10	Although others do right, the wicked keep doing wrong
ISA.26.10	and take no notice of the 
ISA.26.11	O 
ISA.26.11	Show them your eagerness to defend your people.
ISA.26.11	Then they will be ashamed.
ISA.26.11	Let your fire consume your enemies.
ISA.26.12	, you will grant us peace;
ISA.26.12	all we have accomplished is really from you.
ISA.26.13	O 
ISA.26.13	but you alone are the one we worship.
ISA.26.14	Those we served before are dead and gone.
ISA.26.14	Their departed spirits will never return!
ISA.26.14	You attacked them and destroyed them,
ISA.26.14	and they are long forgotten.
ISA.26.15	O 
ISA.26.15	yes, you have made us great.
ISA.26.15	You have extended our borders,
ISA.26.15	and we give you the glory!
ISA.26.16	, in distress we searched for you.
ISA.26.16	We prayed beneath the burden of your discipline.
ISA.26.17	Just as a pregnant woman
ISA.26.17	writhes and cries out in pain as she gives birth,
ISA.26.17	so were we in your presence, 
ISA.26.18	We, too, writhe in agony,
ISA.26.18	but nothing comes of our suffering.
ISA.26.18	We have not given salvation to the earth,
ISA.26.18	nor brought life into the world.
ISA.26.19	But those who die in the 
ISA.26.19	their bodies will rise again!
ISA.26.19	Those who sleep in the earth
ISA.26.19	will rise up and sing for joy!
ISA.26.19	For your life-giving light will fall like dew
ISA.26.19	on your people in the place of the dead!
ISA.26.20	Go home, my people,
ISA.26.20	and lock your doors!
ISA.26.20	Hide yourselves for a little while
ISA.26.20	until the 
ISA.26.21	Look! The 
ISA.26.21	to punish the people of the earth for their sins.
ISA.26.21	The earth will no longer hide those who have been killed.
ISA.26.21	They will be brought out for all to see.
ISA.27.1	In that day the 
ISA.27.2	“In that day,
ISA.27.2	sing about the fruitful vineyard.
ISA.27.3	I, the 
ISA.27.3	watering it carefully.
ISA.27.3	Day and night I will watch so no one can harm it.
ISA.27.4	My anger will be gone.
ISA.27.4	If I find briers and thorns growing,
ISA.27.4	I will attack them;
ISA.27.4	I will burn them up—
ISA.27.5	unless they turn to me for help.
ISA.27.5	Let them make peace with me;
ISA.27.5	yes, let them make peace with me.”
ISA.27.6	The time is coming when Jacob’s descendants will take root.
ISA.27.6	Israel will bud and blossom
ISA.27.6	and fill the whole earth with fruit!
ISA.27.7	Has the 
ISA.27.7	as he struck her enemies?
ISA.27.7	Has he punished her
ISA.27.7	as he punished them?
ISA.27.8	No, but he exiled Israel to call her to account.
ISA.27.8	She was exiled from her land
ISA.27.8	as though blown away in a storm from the east.
ISA.27.9	The 
ISA.27.9	to take away all her sin.
ISA.27.9	As a result, all the pagan altars will be crushed to dust.
ISA.27.9	No Asherah pole or pagan shrine will be left standing.
ISA.27.10	The fortified towns will be silent and empty,
ISA.27.10	the houses abandoned, the streets overgrown with weeds.
ISA.27.10	Calves will graze there,
ISA.27.10	chewing on twigs and branches.
ISA.27.11	The people are like the dead branches of a tree,
ISA.27.11	broken off and used for kindling beneath the cooking pots.
ISA.27.11	Israel is a foolish and stupid nation,
ISA.27.11	for its people have turned away from God.
ISA.27.11	Therefore, the one who made them
ISA.27.11	will show them no pity or mercy.
ISA.27.12	Yet the time will come when the 
ISA.27.13	In that day the great trumpet will sound. Many who were dying in exile in Assyria and Egypt will return to Jerusalem to worship the 
ISA.28.1	What sorrow awaits the proud city of Samaria—
ISA.28.1	the glorious crown of the drunks of Israel.
ISA.28.1	It sits at the head of a fertile valley,
ISA.28.1	but its glorious beauty will fade like a flower.
ISA.28.1	It is the pride of a people
ISA.28.1	brought down by wine.
ISA.28.2	For the Lord will send a mighty army against it.
ISA.28.2	Like a mighty hailstorm and a torrential rain,
ISA.28.2	they will burst upon it like a surging flood
ISA.28.2	and smash it to the ground.
ISA.28.3	The proud city of Samaria—
ISA.28.3	the glorious crown of the drunks of Israel
ISA.28.3	will be trampled beneath its enemies’ feet.
ISA.28.4	It sits at the head of a fertile valley,
ISA.28.4	but its glorious beauty will fade like a flower.
ISA.28.4	Whoever sees it will snatch it up,
ISA.28.4	as an early fig is quickly picked and eaten.
ISA.28.5	Then at last the 
ISA.28.5	will himself be Israel’s glorious crown.
ISA.28.5	He will be the pride and joy
ISA.28.5	of the remnant of his people.
ISA.28.6	He will give a longing for justice
ISA.28.6	to their judges.
ISA.28.6	He will give great courage
ISA.28.6	to their warriors who stand at the gates.
ISA.28.7	Now, however, Israel is led by drunks
ISA.28.7	who reel with wine and stagger with alcohol.
ISA.28.7	The priests and prophets stagger with alcohol
ISA.28.7	and lose themselves in wine.
ISA.28.7	They reel when they see visions
ISA.28.7	and stagger as they render decisions.
ISA.28.8	Their tables are covered with vomit;
ISA.28.8	filth is everywhere.
ISA.28.9	“Who does the 
ISA.28.9	“Why does he speak to us like this?
ISA.28.9	Are we little children,
ISA.28.9	just recently weaned?
ISA.28.10	He tells us everything over and over—
ISA.28.10	one line at a time,
ISA.28.10	one line at a time,
ISA.28.10	a little here,
ISA.28.10	and a little there!”
ISA.28.11	So now God will have to speak to his people
ISA.28.11	through foreign oppressors who speak a strange language!
ISA.28.12	God has told his people,
ISA.28.12	“Here is a place of rest;
ISA.28.12	let the weary rest here.
ISA.28.12	This is a place of quiet rest.”
ISA.28.12	But they would not listen.
ISA.28.13	So the 
ISA.28.13	one line at a time,
ISA.28.13	one line at a time,
ISA.28.13	a little here,
ISA.28.13	and a little there,
ISA.28.13	so that they will stumble and fall.
ISA.28.13	They will be injured, trapped, and captured.
ISA.28.14	Therefore, listen to this message from the 
ISA.28.14	you scoffing rulers in Jerusalem.
ISA.28.15	You boast, “We have struck a bargain to cheat death
ISA.28.15	and have made a deal to dodge the grave.
ISA.28.15	The coming destruction can never touch us,
ISA.28.15	for we have built a strong refuge made of lies and deception.”
ISA.28.16	Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
ISA.28.16	“Look! I am placing a foundation stone in Jerusalem,
ISA.28.16	a firm and tested stone.
ISA.28.16	It is a precious cornerstone that is safe to build on.
ISA.28.16	Whoever believes need never be shaken.
ISA.28.17	I will test you with the measuring line of justice
ISA.28.17	and the plumb line of righteousness.
ISA.28.17	Since your refuge is made of lies,
ISA.28.17	a hailstorm will knock it down.
ISA.28.17	Since it is made of deception,
ISA.28.17	a flood will sweep it away.
ISA.28.18	I will cancel the bargain you made to cheat death,
ISA.28.18	and I will overturn your deal to dodge the grave.
ISA.28.18	When the terrible enemy sweeps through,
ISA.28.18	you will be trampled into the ground.
ISA.28.19	Again and again that flood will come,
ISA.28.19	morning after morning,
ISA.28.19	day and night,
ISA.28.19	until you are carried away.”
ISA.28.19	This message will bring terror to your people.
ISA.28.20	The bed you have made is too short to lie on.
ISA.28.20	The blankets are too narrow to cover you.
ISA.28.21	The 
ISA.28.21	and against the Amorites at Gibeon.
ISA.28.21	He will come to do a strange thing;
ISA.28.21	he will come to do an unusual deed:
ISA.28.22	For the Lord, the 
ISA.28.22	has plainly said that he is determined to crush the whole land.
ISA.28.22	So scoff no more,
ISA.28.22	or your punishment will be even greater.
ISA.28.23	Listen to me;
ISA.28.23	listen, and pay close attention.
ISA.28.24	Does a farmer always plow and never sow?
ISA.28.24	Is he forever cultivating the soil and never planting?
ISA.28.25	Does he not finally plant his seeds—
ISA.28.25	black cumin, cumin, wheat, barley, and emmer wheat—
ISA.28.25	each in its proper way,
ISA.28.25	and each in its proper place?
ISA.28.26	The farmer knows just what to do,
ISA.28.26	for God has given him understanding.
ISA.28.27	A heavy sledge is never used to thresh black cumin;
ISA.28.27	rather, it is beaten with a light stick.
ISA.28.27	A threshing wheel is never rolled on cumin;
ISA.28.27	instead, it is beaten lightly with a flail.
ISA.28.28	Grain for bread is easily crushed,
ISA.28.28	so he doesn’t keep on pounding it.
ISA.28.28	He threshes it under the wheels of a cart,
ISA.28.28	but he doesn’t pulverize it.
ISA.28.29	The 
ISA.28.29	and he gives the farmer great wisdom.
ISA.29.1	“What sorrow awaits Ariel,
ISA.29.1	Year after year you celebrate your feasts.
ISA.29.2	Yet I will bring disaster upon you,
ISA.29.2	and there will be much weeping and sorrow.
ISA.29.2	For Jerusalem will become what her name Ariel means—
ISA.29.2	an altar covered with blood.
ISA.29.3	I will be your enemy,
ISA.29.3	surrounding Jerusalem and attacking its walls.
ISA.29.3	I will build siege towers
ISA.29.3	and destroy it.
ISA.29.4	Then deep from the earth you will speak;
ISA.29.4	from low in the dust your words will come.
ISA.29.4	Your voice will whisper from the ground
ISA.29.4	like a ghost conjured up from the grave.
ISA.29.5	“But suddenly, your ruthless enemies will be crushed
ISA.29.5	like the finest of dust.
ISA.29.5	Your many attackers will be driven away
ISA.29.5	like chaff before the wind.
ISA.29.5	Suddenly, in an instant,
ISA.29.6	I, the 
ISA.29.6	with thunder and earthquake and great noise,
ISA.29.6	with whirlwind and storm and consuming fire.
ISA.29.7	All the nations fighting against Jerusalem
ISA.29.7	will vanish like a dream!
ISA.29.7	Those who are attacking her walls
ISA.29.7	will vanish like a vision in the night.
ISA.29.8	A hungry person dreams of eating
ISA.29.8	but wakes up still hungry.
ISA.29.8	A thirsty person dreams of drinking
ISA.29.8	but is still faint from thirst when morning comes.
ISA.29.8	So it will be with your enemies,
ISA.29.8	with those who attack Mount Zion.”
ISA.29.9	Are you amazed and incredulous?
ISA.29.9	Don’t you believe it?
ISA.29.9	Then go ahead and be blind.
ISA.29.9	You are stupid, but not from wine!
ISA.29.9	You stagger, but not from liquor!
ISA.29.10	For the 
ISA.29.10	He has closed the eyes of your prophets and visionaries.
ISA.29.11	All the future events in this vision are like a sealed book to them. When you give it to those who can read, they will say, “We can’t read it because it is sealed.” 
ISA.29.12	When you give it to those who cannot read, they will say, “We don’t know how to read.”
ISA.29.13	And so the Lord says,
ISA.29.13	“These people say they are mine.
ISA.29.13	They honor me with their lips,
ISA.29.13	but their hearts are far from me.
ISA.29.13	And their worship of me
ISA.29.13	is nothing but man-made rules learned by rote.
ISA.29.14	Because of this, I will once again astound these hypocrites
ISA.29.14	with amazing wonders.
ISA.29.14	The wisdom of the wise will pass away,
ISA.29.14	and the intelligence of the intelligent will disappear.”
ISA.29.15	What sorrow awaits those who try to hide their plans from the 
ISA.29.15	who do their evil deeds in the dark!
ISA.29.15	“The 
ISA.29.15	“He doesn’t know what’s going on!”
ISA.29.16	How foolish can you be?
ISA.29.16	He is the Potter, and he is certainly greater than you, the clay!
ISA.29.16	Should the created thing say of the one who made it,
ISA.29.16	“He didn’t make me”?
ISA.29.16	Does a jar ever say,
ISA.29.16	“The potter who made me is stupid”?
ISA.29.17	Soon—and it will not be very long—
ISA.29.17	the forests of Lebanon will become a fertile field,
ISA.29.17	and the fertile field will yield bountiful crops.
ISA.29.18	In that day the deaf will hear words read from a book,
ISA.29.18	and the blind will see through the gloom and darkness.
ISA.29.19	The humble will be filled with fresh joy from the 
ISA.29.19	The poor will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.29.20	The scoffer will be gone,
ISA.29.20	the arrogant will disappear,
ISA.29.20	and those who plot evil will be killed.
ISA.29.21	Those who convict the innocent
ISA.29.21	by their false testimony will disappear.
ISA.29.21	A similar fate awaits those who use trickery to pervert justice
ISA.29.21	and who tell lies to destroy the innocent.
ISA.29.22	That is why the 
ISA.29.22	“My people will no longer be ashamed
ISA.29.22	or turn pale with fear.
ISA.29.23	For when they see their many children
ISA.29.23	and all the blessings I have given them,
ISA.29.23	they will recognize the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob.
ISA.29.23	They will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
ISA.29.24	Then the wayward will gain understanding,
ISA.29.24	and complainers will accept instruction.
ISA.30.1	“What sorrow awaits my rebellious children,”
ISA.30.1	says the 
ISA.30.1	“You make plans that are contrary to mine.
ISA.30.1	You make alliances not directed by my Spirit,
ISA.30.1	thus piling up your sins.
ISA.30.2	For without consulting me,
ISA.30.2	you have gone down to Egypt for help.
ISA.30.2	You have put your trust in Pharaoh’s protection.
ISA.30.2	You have tried to hide in his shade.
ISA.30.3	But by trusting Pharaoh, you will be humiliated,
ISA.30.3	and by depending on him, you will be disgraced.
ISA.30.4	For though his power extends to Zoan
ISA.30.4	and his officials have arrived in Hanes,
ISA.30.5	all who trust in him will be ashamed.
ISA.30.5	He will not help you.
ISA.30.5	Instead, he will disgrace you.”
ISA.30.6	This message came to me concerning the animals in the Negev:
ISA.30.6	The caravan moves slowly
ISA.30.6	across the terrible desert to Egypt—
ISA.30.6	donkeys weighed down with riches
ISA.30.6	and camels loaded with treasure—
ISA.30.6	all to pay for Egypt’s protection.
ISA.30.6	They travel through the wilderness,
ISA.30.6	a place of lionesses and lions,
ISA.30.6	a place where vipers and poisonous snakes live.
ISA.30.6	All this, and Egypt will give you nothing in return.
ISA.30.7	Egypt’s promises are worthless!
ISA.30.7	Therefore, I call her Rahab—
ISA.30.7	the Harmless Dragon.
ISA.30.8	Now go and write down these words.
ISA.30.8	Write them in a book.
ISA.30.8	They will stand until the end of time
ISA.30.8	as a witness
ISA.30.9	that these people are stubborn rebels
ISA.30.9	who refuse to pay attention to the 
ISA.30.10	They tell the seers,
ISA.30.10	“Stop seeing visions!”
ISA.30.10	They tell the prophets,
ISA.30.10	“Don’t tell us what is right.
ISA.30.10	Tell us nice things.
ISA.30.10	Tell us lies.
ISA.30.11	Forget all this gloom.
ISA.30.11	Get off your narrow path.
ISA.30.11	Stop telling us about your
ISA.30.11	‘Holy One of Israel.’”
ISA.30.12	This is the reply of the Holy One of Israel:
ISA.30.12	“Because you despise what I tell you
ISA.30.12	and trust instead in oppression and lies,
ISA.30.13	calamity will come upon you suddenly—
ISA.30.13	like a bulging wall that bursts and falls.
ISA.30.13	In an instant it will collapse
ISA.30.13	and come crashing down.
ISA.30.14	You will be smashed like a piece of pottery—
ISA.30.14	shattered so completely that
ISA.30.14	there won’t be a piece big enough
ISA.30.14	to carry coals from a fireplace
ISA.30.14	or a little water from the well.”
ISA.30.15	This is what the Sovereign 
ISA.30.15	the Holy One of Israel, says:
ISA.30.15	“Only in returning to me
ISA.30.15	and resting in me will you be saved.
ISA.30.15	In quietness and confidence is your strength.
ISA.30.15	But you would have none of it.
ISA.30.16	You said, ‘No, we will get our help from Egypt.
ISA.30.16	They will give us swift horses for riding into battle.’
ISA.30.16	But the only swiftness you are going to see
ISA.30.16	is the swiftness of your enemies chasing you!
ISA.30.17	One of them will chase a thousand of you.
ISA.30.17	Five of them will make all of you flee.
ISA.30.17	You will be left like a lonely flagpole on a hill
ISA.30.17	or a tattered banner on a distant mountaintop.”
ISA.30.18	So the 
ISA.30.18	so he can show you his love and compassion.
ISA.30.18	For the 
ISA.30.18	Blessed are those who wait for his help.
ISA.30.19	O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem,
ISA.30.19	you will weep no more.
ISA.30.19	He will be gracious if you ask for help.
ISA.30.19	He will surely respond to the sound of your cries.
ISA.30.20	Though the Lord gave you adversity for food
ISA.30.20	and suffering for drink,
ISA.30.20	he will still be with you to teach you.
ISA.30.20	You will see your teacher with your own eyes.
ISA.30.21	Your own ears will hear him.
ISA.30.21	Right behind you a voice will say,
ISA.30.21	“This is the way you should go,”
ISA.30.21	whether to the right or to the left.
ISA.30.22	Then you will destroy all your silver idols
ISA.30.22	and your precious gold images.
ISA.30.22	You will throw them out like filthy rags,
ISA.30.22	saying to them, “Good riddance!”
ISA.30.23	Then the 
ISA.30.24	The oxen and donkeys that till the ground will eat good grain, its chaff blown away by the wind. 
ISA.30.25	In that day, when your enemies are slaughtered and the towers fall, there will be streams of water flowing down every mountain and hill. 
ISA.30.26	The moon will be as bright as the sun, and the sun will be seven times brighter—like the light of seven days in one! So it will be when the 
ISA.30.27	Look! The 
ISA.30.27	burning with anger,
ISA.30.27	surrounded by thick, rising smoke.
ISA.30.27	His lips are filled with fury;
ISA.30.27	his words consume like fire.
ISA.30.28	His hot breath pours out like a flood
ISA.30.28	up to the neck of his enemies.
ISA.30.28	He will sift out the proud nations for destruction.
ISA.30.28	He will bridle them and lead them away to ruin.
ISA.30.29	But the people of God will sing a song of joy,
ISA.30.29	like the songs at the holy festivals.
ISA.30.29	You will be filled with joy,
ISA.30.29	as when a flutist leads a group of pilgrims
ISA.30.29	to Jerusalem, the mountain of the 
ISA.30.29	to the Rock of Israel.
ISA.30.30	And the 
ISA.30.30	He will display the strength of his mighty arm.
ISA.30.30	It will descend with devouring flames,
ISA.30.30	with cloudbursts, thunderstorms, and huge hailstones.
ISA.30.31	At the 
ISA.30.31	He will strike them down with his royal scepter.
ISA.30.32	And as the 
ISA.30.32	his people will celebrate with tambourines and harps.
ISA.30.32	Lifting his mighty arm, he will fight the Assyrians.
ISA.30.33	Topheth—the place of burning—
ISA.30.33	has long been ready for the Assyrian king;
ISA.30.33	the pyre is piled high with wood.
ISA.30.33	The breath of the 
ISA.30.33	will set it ablaze.
ISA.31.1	What sorrow awaits those who look to Egypt for help,
ISA.31.1	trusting their horses, chariots, and charioteers
ISA.31.1	and depending on the strength of human armies
ISA.31.1	instead of looking to the 
ISA.31.1	the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.31.2	In his wisdom, the 
ISA.31.2	he will not change his mind.
ISA.31.2	He will rise against the wicked
ISA.31.2	and against their helpers.
ISA.31.3	For these Egyptians are mere humans, not God!
ISA.31.3	Their horses are puny flesh, not mighty spirits!
ISA.31.3	When the 
ISA.31.3	those who help will stumble,
ISA.31.3	and those being helped will fall.
ISA.31.3	They will all fall down and die together.
ISA.31.4	But this is what the 
ISA.31.4	“When a strong young lion
ISA.31.4	stands growling over a sheep it has killed,
ISA.31.4	it is not frightened by the shouts and noise
ISA.31.4	of a whole crowd of shepherds.
ISA.31.4	In the same way, the 
ISA.31.4	will come down and fight on Mount Zion.
ISA.31.5	The 
ISA.31.5	and protect it like a bird protecting its nest.
ISA.31.5	He will defend and save the city;
ISA.31.5	he will pass over it and rescue it.”
ISA.31.6	Though you are such wicked rebels, my people, come and return to the 
ISA.31.7	I know the glorious day will come when each of you will throw away the gold idols and silver images your sinful hands have made.
ISA.31.8	“The Assyrians will be destroyed,
ISA.31.8	but not by the swords of men.
ISA.31.8	The sword of God will strike them,
ISA.31.8	and they will panic and flee.
ISA.31.8	The strong young Assyrians
ISA.31.8	will be taken away as captives.
ISA.31.9	Even the strongest will quake with terror,
ISA.31.9	and princes will flee when they see your battle flags,”
ISA.31.9	says the 
ISA.31.9	whose flame blazes from Jerusalem.
ISA.32.1	Look, a righteous king is coming!
ISA.32.1	And honest princes will rule under him.
ISA.32.2	Each one will be like a shelter from the wind
ISA.32.2	and a refuge from the storm,
ISA.32.2	like streams of water in the desert
ISA.32.2	and the shadow of a great rock in a parched land.
ISA.32.3	Then everyone who has eyes will be able to see the truth,
ISA.32.3	and everyone who has ears will be able to hear it.
ISA.32.4	Even the hotheads will be full of sense and understanding.
ISA.32.4	Those who stammer will speak out plainly.
ISA.32.5	In that day ungodly fools will not be heroes.
ISA.32.5	Scoundrels will not be respected.
ISA.32.6	For fools speak foolishness
ISA.32.6	and make evil plans.
ISA.32.6	They practice ungodliness
ISA.32.6	and spread false teachings about the 
ISA.32.6	They deprive the hungry of food
ISA.32.6	and give no water to the thirsty.
ISA.32.7	The smooth tricks of scoundrels are evil.
ISA.32.7	They plot crooked schemes.
ISA.32.7	They lie to convict the poor,
ISA.32.7	even when the cause of the poor is just.
ISA.32.8	But generous people plan to do what is generous,
ISA.32.8	and they stand firm in their generosity.
ISA.32.9	Listen, you women who lie around in ease.
ISA.32.9	Listen to me, you who are so smug.
ISA.32.10	In a short time—just a little more than a year—
ISA.32.10	you careless ones will suddenly begin to care.
ISA.32.10	For your fruit crops will fail,
ISA.32.10	and the harvest will never take place.
ISA.32.11	Tremble, you women of ease;
ISA.32.11	throw off your complacency.
ISA.32.11	Strip off your pretty clothes,
ISA.32.11	and put on burlap to show your grief.
ISA.32.12	Beat your breasts in sorrow for your bountiful farms
ISA.32.12	and your fruitful grapevines.
ISA.32.13	For your land will be overgrown with thorns and briers.
ISA.32.13	Your joyful homes and happy towns will be gone.
ISA.32.14	The palace and the city will be deserted,
ISA.32.14	and busy towns will be empty.
ISA.32.14	Wild donkeys will frolic and flocks will graze
ISA.32.14	in the empty forts
ISA.32.15	until at last the Spirit is poured out
ISA.32.15	on us from heaven.
ISA.32.15	Then the wilderness will become a fertile field,
ISA.32.15	and the fertile field will yield bountiful crops.
ISA.32.16	Justice will rule in the wilderness
ISA.32.16	and righteousness in the fertile field.
ISA.32.17	And this righteousness will bring peace.
ISA.32.17	Yes, it will bring quietness and confidence forever.
ISA.32.18	My people will live in safety, quietly at home.
ISA.32.18	They will be at rest.
ISA.32.19	Even if the forest should be destroyed
ISA.32.19	and the city torn down,
ISA.32.20	the 
ISA.32.20	Wherever they plant seed, bountiful crops will spring up.
ISA.32.20	Their cattle and donkeys will graze freely.
ISA.33.1	What sorrow awaits you Assyrians, who have destroyed others
ISA.33.1	but have never been destroyed yourselves.
ISA.33.1	You betray others,
ISA.33.1	but you have never been betrayed.
ISA.33.1	When you are done destroying,
ISA.33.1	you will be destroyed.
ISA.33.1	When you are done betraying,
ISA.33.1	you will be betrayed.
ISA.33.2	But 
ISA.33.2	for we have waited for you.
ISA.33.2	Be our strong arm each day
ISA.33.2	and our salvation in times of trouble.
ISA.33.3	The enemy runs at the sound of your voice.
ISA.33.3	When you stand up, the nations flee!
ISA.33.4	Just as caterpillars and locusts strip the fields and vines,
ISA.33.4	so the fallen army of Assyria will be stripped!
ISA.33.5	Though the 
ISA.33.5	he will make Jerusalem
ISA.33.6	In that day he will be your sure foundation,
ISA.33.6	providing a rich store of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge.
ISA.33.6	The fear of the 
ISA.33.7	But now your brave warriors weep in public.
ISA.33.7	Your ambassadors of peace cry in bitter disappointment.
ISA.33.8	Your roads are deserted;
ISA.33.8	no one travels them anymore.
ISA.33.8	The Assyrians have broken their peace treaty
ISA.33.8	and care nothing for the promises they made before witnesses.
ISA.33.8	They have no respect for anyone.
ISA.33.9	The land of Israel wilts in mourning.
ISA.33.9	Lebanon withers with shame.
ISA.33.9	The plain of Sharon is now a wilderness.
ISA.33.9	Bashan and Carmel have been plundered.
ISA.33.10	But the 
ISA.33.10	Now I will show my power and might.
ISA.33.11	You Assyrians produce nothing but dry grass and stubble.
ISA.33.11	Your own breath will turn to fire and consume you.
ISA.33.12	Your people will be burned up completely,
ISA.33.12	like thornbushes cut down and tossed in a fire.
ISA.33.13	Listen to what I have done, you nations far away!
ISA.33.13	And you that are near, acknowledge my might!”
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Jerusalem shake with fear.
ISA.33.14	Terror seizes the godless.
ISA.33.14	“Who can live with this devouring fire?” they cry.
ISA.33.14	“Who can survive this all-consuming fire?”
ISA.33.15	Those who are honest and fair,
ISA.33.15	who refuse to profit by fraud,
ISA.33.15	who stay far away from bribes,
ISA.33.15	who refuse to listen to those who plot murder,
ISA.33.15	who shut their eyes to all enticement to do wrong—
ISA.33.16	these are the ones who will dwell on high.
ISA.33.16	The rocks of the mountains will be their fortress.
ISA.33.16	Food will be supplied to them,
ISA.33.16	and they will have water in abundance.
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see the king in all his splendor,
ISA.33.17	and you will see a land that stretches into the distance.
ISA.33.18	You will think back to this time of terror, asking,
ISA.33.18	“Where are the Assyrian officers
ISA.33.18	who counted our towers?
ISA.33.18	Where are the bookkeepers
ISA.33.18	who recorded the plunder taken from our fallen city?”
ISA.33.19	You will no longer see these fierce, violent people
ISA.33.19	with their strange, unknown language.
ISA.33.20	Instead, you will see Zion as a place of holy festivals.
ISA.33.20	You will see Jerusalem, a city quiet and secure.
ISA.33.20	It will be like a tent whose ropes are taut
ISA.33.20	and whose stakes are firmly fixed.
ISA.33.21	The 
ISA.33.21	He will be like a wide river of protection
ISA.33.21	that no enemy can cross,
ISA.33.21	that no enemy ship can sail upon.
ISA.33.22	For the 
ISA.33.22	our lawgiver, and our king.
ISA.33.22	He will care for us and save us.
ISA.33.23	The enemies’ sails hang loose
ISA.33.23	on broken masts with useless tackle.
ISA.33.23	Their treasure will be divided by the people of God.
ISA.33.23	Even the lame will take their share!
ISA.33.24	The people of Israel will no longer say,
ISA.33.24	“We are sick and helpless,”
ISA.33.24	for the 
ISA.34.1	Come here and listen, O nations of the earth.
ISA.34.1	Let the world and everything in it hear my words.
ISA.34.2	For the 
ISA.34.2	His fury is against all their armies.
ISA.34.2	He will completely destroy
ISA.34.2	dooming them to slaughter.
ISA.34.3	Their dead will be left unburied,
ISA.34.3	and the stench of rotting bodies will fill the land.
ISA.34.3	The mountains will flow with their blood.
ISA.34.4	The heavens above will melt away
ISA.34.4	and disappear like a rolled-up scroll.
ISA.34.4	The stars will fall from the sky
ISA.34.4	like withered leaves from a grapevine,
ISA.34.4	or shriveled figs from a fig tree.
ISA.34.5	And when my sword has finished its work in the heavens,
ISA.34.5	it will fall upon Edom,
ISA.34.5	the nation I have marked for destruction.
ISA.34.6	The sword of the 
ISA.34.6	and covered with fat—
ISA.34.6	with the blood of lambs and goats,
ISA.34.6	with the fat of rams prepared for sacrifice.
ISA.34.6	Yes, the 
ISA.34.6	He will make a mighty slaughter in Edom.
ISA.34.7	Even men as strong as wild oxen will die—
ISA.34.7	the young men alongside the veterans.
ISA.34.7	The land will be soaked with blood
ISA.34.7	and the soil enriched with fat.
ISA.34.8	For it is the day of the 
ISA.34.8	the year when Edom will be paid back for all it did to Israel.
ISA.34.9	The streams of Edom will be filled with burning pitch,
ISA.34.9	and the ground will be covered with fire.
ISA.34.10	This judgment on Edom will never end;
ISA.34.10	the smoke of its burning will rise forever.
ISA.34.10	The land will lie deserted from generation to generation.
ISA.34.10	No one will live there anymore.
ISA.34.11	It will be haunted by the desert owl and the screech owl,
ISA.34.11	the great owl and the raven.
ISA.34.11	For God will measure that land carefully;
ISA.34.11	he will measure it for chaos and destruction.
ISA.34.12	It will be called the Land of Nothing,
ISA.34.12	and all its nobles will soon be gone.
ISA.34.13	Thorns will overrun its palaces;
ISA.34.13	nettles and thistles will grow in its forts.
ISA.34.13	The ruins will become a haunt for jackals
ISA.34.13	and a home for owls.
ISA.34.14	Desert animals will mingle there with hyenas,
ISA.34.14	their howls filling the night.
ISA.34.14	Wild goats will bleat at one another among the ruins,
ISA.34.14	and night creatures
ISA.34.15	There the owl will make her nest and lay her eggs.
ISA.34.15	She will hatch her young and cover them with her wings.
ISA.34.15	And the buzzards will come,
ISA.34.15	each one with its mate.
ISA.34.16	Search the book of the 
ISA.34.16	and see what he will do.
ISA.34.16	Not one of these birds and animals will be missing,
ISA.34.16	and none will lack a mate,
ISA.34.16	for the 
ISA.34.16	His Spirit will make it all come true.
ISA.34.17	He has surveyed and divided the land
ISA.34.17	and deeded it over to those creatures.
ISA.34.17	They will possess it forever,
ISA.34.17	from generation to generation.
ISA.35.1	Even the wilderness and desert will be glad in those days.
ISA.35.1	The wasteland will rejoice and blossom with spring crocuses.
ISA.35.2	Yes, there will be an abundance of flowers
ISA.35.2	and singing and joy!
ISA.35.2	The deserts will become as green as the mountains of Lebanon,
ISA.35.2	as lovely as Mount Carmel or the plain of Sharon.
ISA.35.2	There the 
ISA.35.2	the splendor of our God.
ISA.35.3	With this news, strengthen those who have tired hands,
ISA.35.3	and encourage those who have weak knees.
ISA.35.4	Say to those with fearful hearts,
ISA.35.4	“Be strong, and do not fear,
ISA.35.4	for your God is coming to destroy your enemies.
ISA.35.4	He is coming to save you.”
ISA.35.5	And when he comes, he will open the eyes of the blind
ISA.35.5	and unplug the ears of the deaf.
ISA.35.6	The lame will leap like a deer,
ISA.35.6	and those who cannot speak will sing for joy!
ISA.35.6	Springs will gush forth in the wilderness,
ISA.35.6	and streams will water the wasteland.
ISA.35.7	The parched ground will become a pool,
ISA.35.7	and springs of water will satisfy the thirsty land.
ISA.35.7	Marsh grass and reeds and rushes will flourish
ISA.35.7	where desert jackals once lived.
ISA.35.8	And a great road will go through that once deserted land.
ISA.35.8	It will be named the Highway of Holiness.
ISA.35.8	Evil-minded people will never travel on it.
ISA.35.8	It will be only for those who walk in God’s ways;
ISA.35.8	fools will never walk there.
ISA.35.9	Lions will not lurk along its course,
ISA.35.9	nor any other ferocious beasts.
ISA.35.9	There will be no other dangers.
ISA.35.9	Only the redeemed will walk on it.
ISA.35.10	Those who have been ransomed by the 
ISA.35.10	They will enter Jerusalem
ISA.35.10	crowned with everlasting joy.
ISA.35.10	Sorrow and mourning will disappear,
ISA.35.10	and they will be filled with joy and gladness.
ISA.36.1	In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign,
ISA.36.2	Then the king of Assyria sent his chief of staff
ISA.36.3	These are the officials who went out to meet with them: Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian.
ISA.36.4	Then the Assyrian king’s chief of staff told them to give this message to Hezekiah:
ISA.36.4	“This is what the great king of Assyria says: What are you trusting in that makes you so confident? 
ISA.36.5	Do you think
ISA.36.6	On Egypt? If you lean on Egypt, it will be like a reed that splinters beneath your weight and pierces your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is completely unreliable!
ISA.36.7	“But perhaps you will say to me, ‘We are trusting in the 
ISA.36.8	“I’ll tell you what! Strike a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you 2,000 horses if you can find that many men to ride on them! 
ISA.36.9	With your tiny army, how can you think of challenging even the weakest contingent of my master’s troops, even with the help of Egypt’s chariots and charioteers? 
ISA.36.10	What’s more, do you think we have invaded your land without the 
ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Assyrian chief of staff, “Please speak to us in Aramaic, for we understand it well. Don’t speak in Hebrew,
ISA.36.12	But Sennacherib’s chief of staff replied, “Do you think my master sent this message only to you and your master? He wants all the people to hear it, for when we put this city under siege, they will suffer along with you. They will be so hungry and thirsty that they will eat their own dung and drink their own urine.”
ISA.36.13	Then the chief of staff stood and shouted in Hebrew to the people on the wall, “Listen to this message from the great king of Assyria! 
ISA.36.14	This is what the king says: Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you. He will never be able to rescue you. 
ISA.36.15	Don’t let him fool you into trusting in the 
ISA.36.16	“Don’t listen to Hezekiah! These are the terms the king of Assyria is offering: Make peace with me—open the gates and come out. Then each of you can continue eating from your own grapevine and fig tree and drinking from your own well. 
ISA.36.17	Then I will arrange to take you to another land like this one—a land of grain and new wine, bread and vineyards.
ISA.36.18	“Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, ‘The 
ISA.36.19	What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? And what about the gods of Sepharvaim? Did any god rescue Samaria from my power? 
ISA.36.20	What god of any nation has ever been able to save its people from my power? So what makes you think that the 
ISA.36.21	But the people were silent and did not utter a word because Hezekiah had commanded them, “Do not answer him.”
ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian, went back to Hezekiah. They tore their clothes in despair, and they went in to see the king and told him what the Assyrian chief of staff had said.
ISA.37.1	When King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes and put on burlap and went into the Temple of the 
ISA.37.2	And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the court secretary, and the leading priests, all dressed in burlap, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
ISA.37.3	They told him, “This is what King Hezekiah says: Today is a day of trouble, insults, and disgrace. It is like when a child is ready to be born, but the mother has no strength to deliver the baby. 
ISA.37.4	But perhaps the 
ISA.37.5	After King Hezekiah’s officials delivered the king’s message to Isaiah, 
ISA.37.6	the prophet replied, “Say to your master, ‘This is what the 
ISA.37.7	Listen! I myself will move against him,
ISA.37.8	Meanwhile, the Assyrian chief of staff left Jerusalem and went to consult the king of Assyria, who had left Lachish and was attacking Libnah.
ISA.37.9	Soon afterward King Sennacherib received word that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia
ISA.37.10	“This message is for King Hezekiah of Judah. Don’t let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you with promises that Jerusalem will not be captured by the king of Assyria. 
ISA.37.11	You know perfectly well what the kings of Assyria have done wherever they have gone. They have completely destroyed everyone who stood in their way! Why should you be any different? 
ISA.37.12	Have the gods of other nations rescued them—such nations as Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar? My predecessors destroyed them all! 
ISA.37.13	What happened to the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad? What happened to the kings of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?”
ISA.37.14	After Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he went up to the 
ISA.37.15	And Hezekiah prayed this prayer before the 
ISA.37.16	“O 
ISA.37.17	Bend down, O 
ISA.37.18	“It is true, 
ISA.37.19	And they have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire and burned them. But of course the Assyrians could destroy them! They were not gods at all—only idols of wood and stone shaped by human hands. 
ISA.37.20	Now, O 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “This is what the 
ISA.37.22	the 
ISA.37.22	“The virgin daughter of Zion
ISA.37.22	despises you and laughs at you.
ISA.37.22	The daughter of Jerusalem
ISA.37.22	shakes her head in derision as you flee.
ISA.37.23	“Whom have you been defying and ridiculing?
ISA.37.23	Against whom did you raise your voice?
ISA.37.23	At whom did you look with such haughty eyes?
ISA.37.23	It was the Holy One of Israel!
ISA.37.24	By your messengers you have defied the Lord.
ISA.37.24	You have said, ‘With my many chariots
ISA.37.24	I have conquered the highest mountains—
ISA.37.24	yes, the remotest peaks of Lebanon.
ISA.37.24	I have cut down its tallest cedars
ISA.37.24	and its finest cypress trees.
ISA.37.24	I have reached its farthest heights
ISA.37.24	and explored its deepest forests.
ISA.37.25	I have dug wells in many foreign lands
ISA.37.25	and refreshed myself with their water.
ISA.37.25	With the sole of my foot,
ISA.37.25	I stopped up all the rivers of Egypt!’
ISA.37.26	“But have you not heard?
ISA.37.26	I decided this long ago.
ISA.37.26	Long ago I planned it,
ISA.37.26	and now I am making it happen.
ISA.37.26	I planned for you to crush fortified cities
ISA.37.26	into heaps of rubble.
ISA.37.27	That is why their people have so little power
ISA.37.27	and are so frightened and confused.
ISA.37.27	They are as weak as grass,
ISA.37.27	as easily trampled as tender green shoots.
ISA.37.27	They are like grass sprouting on a housetop,
ISA.37.27	scorched
ISA.37.28	“But I know you well—
ISA.37.28	where you stay
ISA.37.28	and when you come and go.
ISA.37.28	I know the way you have raged against me.
ISA.37.29	And because of your raging against me
ISA.37.29	and your arrogance, which I have heard for myself,
ISA.37.29	I will put my hook in your nose
ISA.37.29	and my bit in your mouth.
ISA.37.29	I will make you return
ISA.37.29	by the same road on which you came.”
ISA.37.30	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Here is the proof that what I say is true:
ISA.37.30	“This year you will eat only what grows up by itself,
ISA.37.30	and next year you will eat what springs up from that.
ISA.37.30	But in the third year you will plant crops and harvest them;
ISA.37.30	you will tend vineyards and eat their fruit.
ISA.37.31	And you who are left in Judah,
ISA.37.31	who have escaped the ravages of the siege,
ISA.37.31	will put roots down in your own soil
ISA.37.31	and grow up and flourish.
ISA.37.32	For a remnant of my people will spread out from Jerusalem,
ISA.37.32	a group of survivors from Mount Zion.
ISA.37.32	The passionate commitment of the 
ISA.37.32	will make this happen!
ISA.37.33	“And this is what the 
ISA.37.33	“‘His armies will not enter Jerusalem.
ISA.37.33	They will not even shoot an arrow at it.
ISA.37.33	They will not march outside its gates with their shields
ISA.37.33	nor build banks of earth against its walls.
ISA.37.34	The king will return to his own country
ISA.37.34	by the same road on which he came.
ISA.37.34	He will not enter this city,’
ISA.37.34	says the 
ISA.37.35	‘For my own honor and for the sake of my servant David,
ISA.37.35	I will defend this city and protect it.’”
ISA.37.36	That night the angel of the 
ISA.37.37	Then King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and returned to his own land. He went home to his capital of Nineveh and stayed there.
ISA.37.38	One day while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with their swords. They then escaped to the land of Ararat, and another son, Esarhaddon, became the next king of Assyria.
ISA.38.1	About that time Hezekiah became deathly ill, and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to visit him. He gave the king this message: “This is what the 
ISA.38.2	When Hezekiah heard this, he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the 
ISA.38.3	“Remember, O 
ISA.38.4	Then this message came to Isaiah from the 
ISA.38.5	“Go back to Hezekiah and tell him, ‘This is what the 
ISA.38.6	and I will rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. Yes, I will defend this city.
ISA.38.7	“‘And this is the sign from the 
ISA.38.8	I will cause the sun’s shadow to move ten steps backward on the sundial
ISA.38.9	When King Hezekiah was well again, he wrote this poem:
ISA.38.10	I said, “In the prime of my life,
ISA.38.10	must I now enter the place of the dead?
ISA.38.10	Am I to be robbed of the rest of my years?”
ISA.38.11	I said, “Never again will I see the 
ISA.38.11	while still in the land of the living.
ISA.38.11	Never again will I see my friends
ISA.38.11	or be with those who live in this world.
ISA.38.12	My life has been blown away
ISA.38.12	like a shepherd’s tent in a storm.
ISA.38.12	It has been cut short,
ISA.38.12	as when a weaver cuts cloth from a loom.
ISA.38.12	Suddenly, my life was over.
ISA.38.13	I waited patiently all night,
ISA.38.13	but I was torn apart as though by lions.
ISA.38.13	Suddenly, my life was over.
ISA.38.14	Delirious, I chattered like a swallow or a crane,
ISA.38.14	and then I moaned like a mourning dove.
ISA.38.14	My eyes grew tired of looking to heaven for help.
ISA.38.14	I am in trouble, Lord. Help me!”
ISA.38.15	But what could I say?
ISA.38.15	For he himself sent this sickness.
ISA.38.15	Now I will walk humbly throughout my years
ISA.38.15	because of this anguish I have felt.
ISA.38.16	Lord, your discipline is good,
ISA.38.16	for it leads to life and health.
ISA.38.16	You restore my health
ISA.38.16	and allow me to live!
ISA.38.17	Yes, this anguish was good for me,
ISA.38.17	for you have rescued me from death
ISA.38.17	and forgiven all my sins.
ISA.38.18	For the dead
ISA.38.18	they cannot raise their voices in praise.
ISA.38.18	Those who go down to the grave
ISA.38.18	can no longer hope in your faithfulness.
ISA.38.19	Only the living can praise you as I do today.
ISA.38.19	Each generation tells of your faithfulness to the next.
ISA.38.20	Think of it—the 
ISA.38.20	I will sing his praises with instruments
ISA.38.20	every day of my life
ISA.38.20	in the Temple of the 
ISA.38.21	Isaiah had said to Hezekiah’s servants, “Make an ointment from figs and spread it over the boil, and Hezekiah will recover.”
ISA.38.22	And Hezekiah had asked, “What sign will prove that I will go to the Temple of the 
ISA.39.1	Soon after this, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent Hezekiah his best wishes and a gift. He had heard that Hezekiah had been very sick and that he had recovered. 
ISA.39.2	Hezekiah was delighted with the Babylonian envoys and showed them everything in his treasure-houses—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the aromatic oils. He also took them to see his armory and showed them everything in his royal treasuries! There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
ISA.39.3	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did those men want? Where were they from?”
ISA.39.3	Hezekiah replied, “They came from the distant land of Babylon.”
ISA.39.4	“What did they see in your palace?” asked Isaiah.
ISA.39.4	“They saw everything,” Hezekiah replied. “I showed them everything I own—all my royal treasuries.”
ISA.39.5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to this message from the 
ISA.39.6	‘The time is coming when everything in your palace—all the treasures stored up by your ancestors until now—will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says the 
ISA.39.7	‘Some of your very own sons will be taken away into exile. They will become eunuchs who will serve in the palace of Babylon’s king.’”
ISA.39.8	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “This message you have given me from the 
ISA.40.1	“Comfort, comfort my people,”
ISA.40.1	says your God.
ISA.40.2	“Speak tenderly to Jerusalem.
ISA.40.2	Tell her that her sad days are gone
ISA.40.2	and her sins are pardoned.
ISA.40.2	Yes, the 
ISA.40.2	for all her sins.”
ISA.40.3	Listen! It’s the voice of someone shouting,
ISA.40.3	“Clear the way through the wilderness
ISA.40.3	for the 
ISA.40.3	Make a straight highway through the wasteland
ISA.40.3	for our God!
ISA.40.4	Fill in the valleys,
ISA.40.4	and level the mountains and hills.
ISA.40.4	Straighten the curves,
ISA.40.4	and smooth out the rough places.
ISA.40.5	Then the glory of the 
ISA.40.5	and all people will see it together.
ISA.40.5	The 
ISA.40.6	A voice said, “Shout!”
ISA.40.6	I asked, “What should I shout?”
ISA.40.6	“Shout that people are like the grass.
ISA.40.6	Their beauty fades as quickly
ISA.40.6	as the flowers in a field.
ISA.40.7	The grass withers and the flowers fade
ISA.40.7	beneath the breath of the 
ISA.40.7	And so it is with people.
ISA.40.8	The grass withers and the flowers fade,
ISA.40.8	but the word of our God stands forever.”
ISA.40.9	O Zion, messenger of good news,
ISA.40.9	shout from the mountaintops!
ISA.40.9	Shout it louder, O Jerusalem.
ISA.40.9	Shout, and do not be afraid.
ISA.40.9	Tell the towns of Judah,
ISA.40.9	“Your God is coming!”
ISA.40.10	Yes, the Sovereign 
ISA.40.10	He will rule with a powerful arm.
ISA.40.10	See, he brings his reward with him as he comes.
ISA.40.11	He will feed his flock like a shepherd.
ISA.40.11	He will carry the lambs in his arms,
ISA.40.11	holding them close to his heart.
ISA.40.11	He will gently lead the mother sheep with their young.
ISA.40.12	Who else has held the oceans in his hand?
ISA.40.12	Who has measured off the heavens with his fingers?
ISA.40.12	Who else knows the weight of the earth
ISA.40.12	or has weighed the mountains and hills on a scale?
ISA.40.13	Who is able to advise the Spirit of the 
ISA.40.13	Who knows enough to give him advice or teach him?
ISA.40.14	Has the 
ISA.40.14	Does he need instruction about what is good?
ISA.40.14	Did someone teach him what is right
ISA.40.14	or show him the path of justice?
ISA.40.15	No, for all the nations of the world
ISA.40.15	are but a drop in the bucket.
ISA.40.15	They are nothing more
ISA.40.15	than dust on the scales.
ISA.40.15	He picks up the whole earth
ISA.40.15	as though it were a grain of sand.
ISA.40.16	All the wood in Lebanon’s forests
ISA.40.16	and all Lebanon’s animals would not be enough
ISA.40.16	to make a burnt offering worthy of our God.
ISA.40.17	The nations of the world are worth nothing to him.
ISA.40.17	In his eyes they count for less than nothing—
ISA.40.17	mere emptiness and froth.
ISA.40.18	To whom can you compare God?
ISA.40.18	What image can you find to resemble him?
ISA.40.19	Can he be compared to an idol formed in a mold,
ISA.40.19	overlaid with gold, and decorated with silver chains?
ISA.40.20	Or if people are too poor for that,
ISA.40.20	they might at least choose wood that won’t decay
ISA.40.20	and a skilled craftsman
ISA.40.20	to carve an image that won’t fall down!
ISA.40.21	Haven’t you heard? Don’t you understand?
ISA.40.21	Are you deaf to the words of God—
ISA.40.21	the words he gave before the world began?
ISA.40.21	Are you so ignorant?
ISA.40.22	God sits above the circle of the earth.
ISA.40.22	The people below seem like grasshoppers to him!
ISA.40.22	He spreads out the heavens like a curtain
ISA.40.22	and makes his tent from them.
ISA.40.23	He judges the great people of the world
ISA.40.23	and brings them all to nothing.
ISA.40.24	They hardly get started, barely taking root,
ISA.40.24	when he blows on them and they wither.
ISA.40.24	The wind carries them off like chaff.
ISA.40.25	“To whom will you compare me?
ISA.40.25	Who is my equal?” asks the Holy One.
ISA.40.26	Look up into the heavens.
ISA.40.26	Who created all the stars?
ISA.40.26	He brings them out like an army, one after another,
ISA.40.26	calling each by its name.
ISA.40.26	Because of his great power and incomparable strength,
ISA.40.26	not a single one is missing.
ISA.40.27	O Jacob, how can you say the 
ISA.40.27	O Israel, how can you say God ignores your rights?
ISA.40.28	Have you never heard?
ISA.40.28	Have you never understood?
ISA.40.28	The 
ISA.40.28	the Creator of all the earth.
ISA.40.28	He never grows weak or weary.
ISA.40.28	No one can measure the depths of his understanding.
ISA.40.29	He gives power to the weak
ISA.40.29	and strength to the powerless.
ISA.40.30	Even youths will become weak and tired,
ISA.40.30	and young men will fall in exhaustion.
ISA.40.31	But those who trust in the 
ISA.40.31	They will soar high on wings like eagles.
ISA.40.31	They will run and not grow weary.
ISA.40.31	They will walk and not faint.
ISA.41.1	“Listen in silence before me, you lands beyond the sea.
ISA.41.1	Bring your strongest arguments.
ISA.41.1	Come now and speak.
ISA.41.1	The court is ready for your case.
ISA.41.2	“Who has stirred up this king from the east,
ISA.41.2	rightly calling him to God’s service?
ISA.41.2	Who gives this man victory over many nations
ISA.41.2	and permits him to trample their kings underfoot?
ISA.41.2	With his sword, he reduces armies to dust.
ISA.41.2	With his bow, he scatters them like chaff before the wind.
ISA.41.3	He chases them away and goes on safely,
ISA.41.3	though he is walking over unfamiliar ground.
ISA.41.4	Who has done such mighty deeds,
ISA.41.4	summoning each new generation from the beginning of time?
ISA.41.4	It is I, the 
ISA.41.4	I alone am he.”
ISA.41.5	The lands beyond the sea watch in fear.
ISA.41.5	Remote lands tremble and mobilize for war.
ISA.41.6	The idol makers encourage one another,
ISA.41.6	saying to each other, “Be strong!”
ISA.41.7	The carver encourages the goldsmith,
ISA.41.7	and the molder helps at the anvil.
ISA.41.7	“Good,” they say. “It’s coming along fine.”
ISA.41.7	Carefully they join the parts together,
ISA.41.7	then fasten the thing in place so it won’t fall over.
ISA.41.8	“But as for you, Israel my servant,
ISA.41.8	Jacob my chosen one,
ISA.41.8	descended from Abraham my friend,
ISA.41.9	I have called you back from the ends of the earth,
ISA.41.9	saying, ‘You are my servant.’
ISA.41.9	For I have chosen you
ISA.41.9	and will not throw you away.
ISA.41.10	Don’t be afraid, for I am with you.
ISA.41.10	Don’t be discouraged, for I am your God.
ISA.41.10	I will strengthen you and help you.
ISA.41.10	I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.
ISA.41.11	“See, all your angry enemies lie there,
ISA.41.11	confused and humiliated.
ISA.41.11	Anyone who opposes you will die
ISA.41.11	and come to nothing.
ISA.41.12	You will look in vain
ISA.41.12	for those who tried to conquer you.
ISA.41.12	Those who attack you
ISA.41.12	will come to nothing.
ISA.41.13	For I hold you by your right hand—
ISA.41.13	I, the 
ISA.41.13	And I say to you,
ISA.41.13	‘Don’t be afraid. I am here to help you.
ISA.41.14	Though you are a lowly worm, O Jacob,
ISA.41.14	don’t be afraid, people of Israel, for I will help you.
ISA.41.14	I am the 
ISA.41.14	I am the Holy One of Israel.’
ISA.41.15	You will be a new threshing instrument
ISA.41.15	with many sharp teeth.
ISA.41.15	You will tear your enemies apart,
ISA.41.15	making chaff of mountains.
ISA.41.16	You will toss them into the air,
ISA.41.16	and the wind will blow them all away;
ISA.41.16	a whirlwind will scatter them.
ISA.41.16	Then you will rejoice in the 
ISA.41.16	You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.41.17	“When the poor and needy search for water and there is none,
ISA.41.17	and their tongues are parched from thirst,
ISA.41.17	then I, the 
ISA.41.17	I, the God of Israel, will never abandon them.
ISA.41.18	I will open up rivers for them on the high plateaus.
ISA.41.18	I will give them fountains of water in the valleys.
ISA.41.18	I will fill the desert with pools of water.
ISA.41.18	Rivers fed by springs will flow across the parched ground.
ISA.41.19	I will plant trees in the barren desert—
ISA.41.19	cedar, acacia, myrtle, olive, cypress, fir, and pine.
ISA.41.20	I am doing this so all who see this miracle
ISA.41.20	will understand what it means—
ISA.41.20	that it is the 
ISA.41.20	the Holy One of Israel who created it.
ISA.41.21	“Present the case for your idols,”
ISA.41.21	says the 
ISA.41.21	“Let them show what they can do,”
ISA.41.21	says the King of Israel.
ISA.41.22	“Let them try to tell us what happened long ago
ISA.41.22	so that we may consider the evidence.
ISA.41.22	Or let them tell us what the future holds,
ISA.41.22	so we can know what’s going to happen.
ISA.41.23	Yes, tell us what will occur in the days ahead.
ISA.41.23	Then we will know you are gods.
ISA.41.23	In fact, do anything—good or bad!
ISA.41.23	Do something that will amaze and frighten us.
ISA.41.24	But no! You are less than nothing and can do nothing at all.
ISA.41.24	Those who choose you pollute themselves.
ISA.41.25	“But I have stirred up a leader who will approach from the north.
ISA.41.25	From the east he will call on my name.
ISA.41.25	I will give him victory over kings and princes.
ISA.41.25	He will trample them as a potter treads on clay.
ISA.41.26	“Who told you from the beginning
ISA.41.26	that this would happen?
ISA.41.26	Who predicted this,
ISA.41.26	making you admit that he was right?
ISA.41.26	No one said a word!
ISA.41.27	I was the first to tell Zion,
ISA.41.27	‘Look! Help is on the way!’
ISA.41.27	I will send Jerusalem a messenger with good news.
ISA.41.28	Not one of your idols told you this.
ISA.41.28	Not one gave any answer when I asked.
ISA.41.29	See, they are all foolish, worthless things.
ISA.41.29	All your idols are as empty as the wind.
ISA.42.1	“Look at my servant, whom I strengthen.
ISA.42.1	He is my chosen one, who pleases me.
ISA.42.1	I have put my Spirit upon him.
ISA.42.1	He will bring justice to the nations.
ISA.42.2	He will not shout
ISA.42.2	or raise his voice in public.
ISA.42.3	He will not crush the weakest reed
ISA.42.3	or put out a flickering candle.
ISA.42.3	He will bring justice to all who have been wronged.
ISA.42.4	He will not falter or lose heart
ISA.42.4	until justice prevails throughout the earth.
ISA.42.4	Even distant lands beyond the sea will wait for his instruction.
ISA.42.5	God, the 
ISA.42.5	He created the earth and everything in it.
ISA.42.5	He gives breath to everyone,
ISA.42.5	life to everyone who walks the earth.
ISA.42.5	And it is he who says,
ISA.42.6	“I, the 
ISA.42.6	I will take you by the hand and guard you,
ISA.42.6	and I will give you to my people, Israel,
ISA.42.6	as a symbol of my covenant with them.
ISA.42.6	And you will be a light to guide the nations.
ISA.42.7	You will open the eyes of the blind.
ISA.42.7	You will free the captives from prison,
ISA.42.7	releasing those who sit in dark dungeons.
ISA.42.8	“I am the 
ISA.42.8	I will not give my glory to anyone else,
ISA.42.8	nor share my praise with carved idols.
ISA.42.9	Everything I prophesied has come true,
ISA.42.9	and now I will prophesy again.
ISA.42.9	I will tell you the future before it happens.”
ISA.42.10	Sing a new song to the 
ISA.42.10	Sing his praises from the ends of the earth!
ISA.42.10	Sing, all you who sail the seas,
ISA.42.10	all you who live in distant coastlands.
ISA.42.11	Join in the chorus, you desert towns;
ISA.42.11	let the villages of Kedar rejoice!
ISA.42.11	Let the people of Sela sing for joy;
ISA.42.11	shout praises from the mountaintops!
ISA.42.12	Let the whole world glorify the 
ISA.42.12	let it sing his praise.
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.13	he will come out like a warrior, full of fury.
ISA.42.13	He will shout his battle cry
ISA.42.13	and crush all his enemies.
ISA.42.14	He will say, “I have long been silent;
ISA.42.14	yes, I have restrained myself.
ISA.42.14	But now, like a woman in labor,
ISA.42.14	I will cry and groan and pant.
ISA.42.15	I will level the mountains and hills
ISA.42.15	and blight all their greenery.
ISA.42.15	I will turn the rivers into dry land
ISA.42.15	and will dry up all the pools.
ISA.42.16	I will lead blind Israel down a new path,
ISA.42.16	guiding them along an unfamiliar way.
ISA.42.16	I will brighten the darkness before them
ISA.42.16	and smooth out the road ahead of them.
ISA.42.16	Yes, I will indeed do these things;
ISA.42.16	I will not forsake them.
ISA.42.17	But those who trust in idols,
ISA.42.17	who say, ‘You are our gods,’
ISA.42.17	will be turned away in shame.
ISA.42.18	“Listen, you who are deaf!
ISA.42.18	Look and see, you blind!
ISA.42.19	Who is as blind as my own people, my servant?
ISA.42.19	Who is as deaf as my messenger?
ISA.42.19	Who is as blind as my chosen people,
ISA.42.19	the servant of the 
ISA.42.20	You see and recognize what is right
ISA.42.20	but refuse to act on it.
ISA.42.20	You hear with your ears,
ISA.42.20	but you don’t really listen.”
ISA.42.21	Because he is righteous,
ISA.42.21	the 
ISA.42.22	But his own people have been robbed and plundered,
ISA.42.22	enslaved, imprisoned, and trapped.
ISA.42.22	They are fair game for anyone
ISA.42.22	and have no one to protect them,
ISA.42.22	no one to take them back home.
ISA.42.23	Who will hear these lessons from the past
ISA.42.23	and see the ruin that awaits you in the future?
ISA.42.24	Who allowed Israel to be robbed and hurt?
ISA.42.24	It was the 
ISA.42.24	for the people would not walk in his path,
ISA.42.24	nor would they obey his law.
ISA.42.25	Therefore, he poured out his fury on them
ISA.42.25	and destroyed them in battle.
ISA.42.25	They were enveloped in flames,
ISA.42.25	but they still refused to understand.
ISA.42.25	They were consumed by fire,
ISA.42.25	but they did not learn their lesson.
ISA.43.1	But now, O Jacob, listen to the 
ISA.43.1	O Israel, the one who formed you says,
ISA.43.1	“Do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you.
ISA.43.1	I have called you by name; you are mine.
ISA.43.2	When you go through deep waters,
ISA.43.2	I will be with you.
ISA.43.2	When you go through rivers of difficulty,
ISA.43.2	you will not drown.
ISA.43.2	When you walk through the fire of oppression,
ISA.43.2	you will not be burned up;
ISA.43.2	the flames will not consume you.
ISA.43.3	For I am the 
ISA.43.3	the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
ISA.43.3	I gave Egypt as a ransom for your freedom;
ISA.43.3	I gave Ethiopia
ISA.43.4	Others were given in exchange for you.
ISA.43.4	I traded their lives for yours
ISA.43.4	because you are precious to me.
ISA.43.4	You are honored, and I love you.
ISA.43.5	“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.
ISA.43.5	I will gather you and your children from east and west.
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north and south,
ISA.43.6	‘Bring my sons and daughters back to Israel
ISA.43.6	from the distant corners of the earth.
ISA.43.7	Bring all who claim me as their God,
ISA.43.7	for I have made them for my glory.
ISA.43.7	It was I who created them.’”
ISA.43.8	Bring out the people who have eyes but are blind,
ISA.43.8	who have ears but are deaf.
ISA.43.9	Gather the nations together!
ISA.43.9	Assemble the peoples of the world!
ISA.43.9	Which of their idols has ever foretold such things?
ISA.43.9	Which can predict what will happen tomorrow?
ISA.43.9	Where are the witnesses of such predictions?
ISA.43.9	Who can verify that they spoke the truth?
ISA.43.10	“But you are my witnesses, O Israel!” says the 
ISA.43.10	“You are my servant.
ISA.43.10	You have been chosen to know me, believe in me,
ISA.43.10	and understand that I alone am God.
ISA.43.10	There is no other God—
ISA.43.10	there never has been, and there never will be.
ISA.43.11	I, yes I, am the 
ISA.43.11	and there is no other Savior.
ISA.43.12	First I predicted your rescue,
ISA.43.12	then I saved you and proclaimed it to the world.
ISA.43.12	No foreign god has ever done this.
ISA.43.12	You are witnesses that I am the only God,”
ISA.43.12	says the 
ISA.43.13	“From eternity to eternity I am God.
ISA.43.13	No one can snatch anyone out of my hand.
ISA.43.13	No one can undo what I have done.”
ISA.43.14	This is what the 
ISA.43.14	“For your sakes I will send an army against Babylon,
ISA.43.14	forcing the Babylonians
ISA.43.15	I am the 
ISA.43.15	Israel’s Creator and King.
ISA.43.16	I am the 
ISA.43.16	making a dry path through the sea.
ISA.43.17	I called forth the mighty army of Egypt
ISA.43.17	with all its chariots and horses.
ISA.43.17	I drew them beneath the waves, and they drowned,
ISA.43.17	their lives snuffed out like a smoldering candlewick.
ISA.43.18	“But forget all that—
ISA.43.18	it is nothing compared to what I am going to do.
ISA.43.19	For I am about to do something new.
ISA.43.19	See, I have already begun! Do you not see it?
ISA.43.19	I will make a pathway through the wilderness.
ISA.43.19	I will create rivers in the dry wasteland.
ISA.43.20	The wild animals in the fields will thank me,
ISA.43.20	the jackals and owls, too,
ISA.43.20	for giving them water in the desert.
ISA.43.20	Yes, I will make rivers in the dry wasteland
ISA.43.20	so my chosen people can be refreshed.
ISA.43.21	I have made Israel for myself,
ISA.43.21	and they will someday honor me before the whole world.
ISA.43.22	“But, dear family of Jacob, you refuse to ask for my help.
ISA.43.22	You have grown tired of me, O Israel!
ISA.43.23	You have not brought me sheep or goats for burnt offerings.
ISA.43.23	You have not honored me with sacrifices,
ISA.43.23	though I have not burdened and wearied you
ISA.43.23	with requests for grain offerings and frankincense.
ISA.43.24	You have not brought me fragrant calamus
ISA.43.24	or pleased me with the fat from sacrifices.
ISA.43.24	Instead, you have burdened me with your sins
ISA.43.24	and wearied me with your faults.
ISA.43.25	“I—yes, I alone—will blot out your sins for my own sake
ISA.43.25	and will never think of them again.
ISA.43.26	Let us review the situation together,
ISA.43.26	and you can present your case to prove your innocence.
ISA.43.27	From the very beginning, your first ancestor sinned against me;
ISA.43.27	all your leaders broke my laws.
ISA.43.28	That is why I have disgraced your priests;
ISA.43.28	I have decreed complete destruction
ISA.43.28	and shame for Israel.
ISA.44.1	“But now, listen to me, Jacob my servant,
ISA.44.1	Israel my chosen one.
ISA.44.2	The 
ISA.44.2	Do not be afraid, O Jacob, my servant,
ISA.44.2	O dear Israel,
ISA.44.3	For I will pour out water to quench your thirst
ISA.44.3	and to irrigate your parched fields.
ISA.44.3	And I will pour out my Spirit on your descendants,
ISA.44.3	and my blessing on your children.
ISA.44.4	They will thrive like watered grass,
ISA.44.4	like willows on a riverbank.
ISA.44.5	Some will proudly claim, ‘I belong to the 
ISA.44.5	Others will say, ‘I am a descendant of Jacob.’
ISA.44.5	Some will write the 
ISA.44.5	and will take the name of Israel as their own.”
ISA.44.6	This is what the 
ISA.44.6	“I am the First and the Last;
ISA.44.6	there is no other God.
ISA.44.7	Who is like me?
ISA.44.7	Let him step forward and prove to you his power.
ISA.44.7	Let him do as I have done since ancient times
ISA.44.7	when I established a people and explained its future.
ISA.44.8	Do not tremble; do not be afraid.
ISA.44.8	Did I not proclaim my purposes for you long ago?
ISA.44.8	You are my witnesses—is there any other God?
ISA.44.8	No! There is no other Rock—not one!”
ISA.44.9	How foolish are those who manufacture idols.
ISA.44.9	These prized objects are really worthless.
ISA.44.9	The people who worship idols don’t know this,
ISA.44.9	so they are all put to shame.
ISA.44.10	Who but a fool would make his own god—
ISA.44.10	an idol that cannot help him one bit?
ISA.44.11	All who worship idols will be disgraced
ISA.44.11	along with all these craftsmen—mere humans—
ISA.44.11	who claim they can make a god.
ISA.44.11	They may all stand together,
ISA.44.11	but they will stand in terror and shame.
ISA.44.12	The blacksmith stands at his forge to make a sharp tool,
ISA.44.12	pounding and shaping it with all his might.
ISA.44.12	His work makes him hungry and weak.
ISA.44.12	It makes him thirsty and faint.
ISA.44.13	Then the wood-carver measures a block of wood
ISA.44.13	and draws a pattern on it.
ISA.44.13	He works with chisel and plane
ISA.44.13	and carves it into a human figure.
ISA.44.13	He gives it human beauty
ISA.44.13	and puts it in a little shrine.
ISA.44.14	He cuts down cedars;
ISA.44.14	he selects the cypress and the oak;
ISA.44.14	he plants the pine in the forest
ISA.44.14	to be nourished by the rain.
ISA.44.15	Then he uses part of the wood to make a fire.
ISA.44.15	With it he warms himself and bakes his bread.
ISA.44.15	Then—yes, it’s true—he takes the rest of it
ISA.44.15	and makes himself a god to worship!
ISA.44.15	He makes an idol
ISA.44.15	and bows down in front of it!
ISA.44.16	He burns part of the tree to roast his meat
ISA.44.16	and to keep himself warm.
ISA.44.16	He says, “Ah, that fire feels good.”
ISA.44.17	Then he takes what’s left
ISA.44.17	and makes his god: a carved idol!
ISA.44.17	He falls down in front of it,
ISA.44.17	worshiping and praying to it.
ISA.44.17	“Rescue me!” he says.
ISA.44.17	“You are my god!”
ISA.44.18	Such stupidity and ignorance!
ISA.44.18	Their eyes are closed, and they cannot see.
ISA.44.18	Their minds are shut, and they cannot think.
ISA.44.19	The person who made the idol never stops to reflect,
ISA.44.19	“Why, it’s just a block of wood!
ISA.44.19	I burned half of it for heat
ISA.44.19	and used it to bake my bread and roast my meat.
ISA.44.19	How can the rest of it be a god?
ISA.44.19	Should I bow down to worship a piece of wood?”
ISA.44.20	The poor, deluded fool feeds on ashes.
ISA.44.20	He trusts something that can’t help him at all.
ISA.44.20	Yet he cannot bring himself to ask,
ISA.44.20	“Is this idol that I’m holding in my hand a lie?”
ISA.44.21	“Pay attention, O Jacob,
ISA.44.21	for you are my servant, O Israel.
ISA.44.21	I, the 
ISA.44.21	and I will not forget you.
ISA.44.22	I have swept away your sins like a cloud.
ISA.44.22	I have scattered your offenses like the morning mist.
ISA.44.22	Oh, return to me,
ISA.44.22	for I have paid the price to set you free.”
ISA.44.23	Sing, O heavens, for the 
ISA.44.23	Shout for joy, O depths of the earth!
ISA.44.23	Break into song,
ISA.44.23	O mountains and forests and every tree!
ISA.44.23	For the 
ISA.44.23	and is glorified in Israel.
ISA.44.24	This is what the 
ISA.44.24	your Redeemer and Creator:
ISA.44.24	“I am the 
ISA.44.24	I alone stretched out the heavens.
ISA.44.24	Who was with me
ISA.44.24	when I made the earth?
ISA.44.25	I expose the false prophets as liars
ISA.44.25	and make fools of fortune-tellers.
ISA.44.25	I cause the wise to give bad advice,
ISA.44.25	thus proving them to be fools.
ISA.44.26	But I carry out the predictions of my prophets!
ISA.44.26	By them I say to Jerusalem, ‘People will live here again,’
ISA.44.26	and to the towns of Judah, ‘You will be rebuilt;
ISA.44.26	I will restore all your ruins!’
ISA.44.27	When I speak to the rivers and say, ‘Dry up!’
ISA.44.27	they will be dry.
ISA.44.28	When I say of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd,’
ISA.44.28	he will certainly do as I say.
ISA.44.28	He will command, ‘Rebuild Jerusalem’;
ISA.44.28	he will say, ‘Restore the Temple.’”
ISA.45.1	This is what the 
ISA.45.1	whose right hand he will empower.
ISA.45.1	Before him, mighty kings will be paralyzed with fear.
ISA.45.1	Their fortress gates will be opened,
ISA.45.1	never to shut again.
ISA.45.2	This is what the 
ISA.45.2	“I will go before you, Cyrus,
ISA.45.2	and level the mountains.
ISA.45.2	I will smash down gates of bronze
ISA.45.2	and cut through bars of iron.
ISA.45.3	And I will give you treasures hidden in the darkness—
ISA.45.3	secret riches.
ISA.45.3	I will do this so you may know that I am the 
ISA.45.3	the God of Israel, the one who calls you by name.
ISA.45.4	“And why have I called you for this work?
ISA.45.4	Why did I call you by name when you did not know me?
ISA.45.4	It is for the sake of Jacob my servant,
ISA.45.4	Israel my chosen one.
ISA.45.5	I am the 
ISA.45.5	there is no other God.
ISA.45.5	I have equipped you for battle,
ISA.45.5	though you don’t even know me,
ISA.45.6	so all the world from east to west
ISA.45.6	will know there is no other God.
ISA.45.6	I am the 
ISA.45.7	I create the light and make the darkness.
ISA.45.7	I send good times and bad times.
ISA.45.7	I, the 
ISA.45.8	“Open up, O heavens,
ISA.45.8	and pour out your righteousness.
ISA.45.8	Let the earth open wide
ISA.45.8	so salvation and righteousness can sprout up together.
ISA.45.8	I, the 
ISA.45.9	“What sorrow awaits those who argue with their Creator.
ISA.45.9	Does a clay pot argue with its maker?
ISA.45.9	Does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it, saying,
ISA.45.9	‘Stop, you’re doing it wrong!’
ISA.45.9	Does the pot exclaim,
ISA.45.9	‘How clumsy can you be?’
ISA.45.10	How terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father,
ISA.45.10	‘Why was I born?’
ISA.45.10	or if it said to its mother,
ISA.45.10	‘Why did you make me this way?’”
ISA.45.11	This is what the 
ISA.45.11	the Holy One of Israel and your Creator:
ISA.45.11	“Do you question what I do for my children?
ISA.45.11	Do you give me orders about the work of my hands?
ISA.45.12	I am the one who made the earth
ISA.45.12	and created people to live on it.
ISA.45.12	With my hands I stretched out the heavens.
ISA.45.12	All the stars are at my command.
ISA.45.13	I will raise up Cyrus to fulfill my righteous purpose,
ISA.45.13	and I will guide his actions.
ISA.45.13	He will restore my city and free my captive people—
ISA.45.13	without seeking a reward!
ISA.45.13	I, the 
ISA.45.14	This is what the 
ISA.45.14	“You will rule the Egyptians,
ISA.45.14	the Ethiopians,
ISA.45.14	They will come to you with all their merchandise,
ISA.45.14	and it will all be yours.
ISA.45.14	They will follow you as prisoners in chains.
ISA.45.14	They will fall to their knees in front of you and say,
ISA.45.14	‘God is with you, and he is the only God.
ISA.45.14	There is no other.’”
ISA.45.15	Truly, O God of Israel, our Savior,
ISA.45.15	you work in mysterious ways.
ISA.45.16	All craftsmen who make idols will be humiliated.
ISA.45.16	They will all be disgraced together.
ISA.45.17	But the 
ISA.45.17	with eternal salvation.
ISA.45.17	Throughout everlasting ages,
ISA.45.17	they will never again be humiliated and disgraced.
ISA.45.18	For the 
ISA.45.18	and he created the heavens and earth
ISA.45.18	and put everything in place.
ISA.45.18	He made the world to be lived in,
ISA.45.18	not to be a place of empty chaos.
ISA.45.18	“I am the 
ISA.45.18	“and there is no other.
ISA.45.19	I publicly proclaim bold promises.
ISA.45.19	I do not whisper obscurities in some dark corner.
ISA.45.19	I would not have told the people of Israel
ISA.45.19	if I could not be found.
ISA.45.19	I, the 
ISA.45.19	and declare only what is right.
ISA.45.20	“Gather together and come,
ISA.45.20	you fugitives from surrounding nations.
ISA.45.20	What fools they are who carry around their wooden idols
ISA.45.20	and pray to gods that cannot save!
ISA.45.21	Consult together, argue your case.
ISA.45.21	Get together and decide what to say.
ISA.45.21	Who made these things known so long ago?
ISA.45.21	What idol ever told you they would happen?
ISA.45.21	Was it not I, the 
ISA.45.21	For there is no other God but me,
ISA.45.21	a righteous God and Savior.
ISA.45.21	There is none but me.
ISA.45.22	Let all the world look to me for salvation!
ISA.45.22	For I am God; there is no other.
ISA.45.23	I have sworn by my own name;
ISA.45.23	I have spoken the truth,
ISA.45.23	and I will never go back on my word:
ISA.45.23	Every knee will bend to me,
ISA.45.23	and every tongue will declare allegiance to me.
ISA.45.24	The people will declare,
ISA.45.24	“The 
ISA.45.24	And all who were angry with him
ISA.45.24	will come to him and be ashamed.
ISA.45.25	In the 
ISA.45.25	and in him they will boast.
ISA.46.1	Bel and Nebo, the gods of Babylon,
ISA.46.1	bow as they are lowered to the ground.
ISA.46.1	They are being hauled away on ox carts.
ISA.46.1	The poor beasts stagger under the weight.
ISA.46.2	Both the idols and their owners are bowed down.
ISA.46.2	The gods cannot protect the people,
ISA.46.2	and the people cannot protect the gods.
ISA.46.2	They go off into captivity together.
ISA.46.3	“Listen to me, descendants of Jacob,
ISA.46.3	all you who remain in Israel.
ISA.46.3	I have cared for you since you were born.
ISA.46.3	Yes, I carried you before you were born.
ISA.46.4	I will be your God throughout your lifetime—
ISA.46.4	until your hair is white with age.
ISA.46.4	I made you, and I will care for you.
ISA.46.4	I will carry you along and save you.
ISA.46.5	“To whom will you compare me?
ISA.46.5	Who is my equal?
ISA.46.6	Some people pour out their silver and gold
ISA.46.6	and hire a craftsman to make a god from it.
ISA.46.6	Then they bow down and worship it!
ISA.46.7	They carry it around on their shoulders,
ISA.46.7	and when they set it down, it stays there.
ISA.46.7	It can’t even move!
ISA.46.7	And when someone prays to it, there is no answer.
ISA.46.7	It can’t rescue anyone from trouble.
ISA.46.8	“Do not forget this! Keep it in mind!
ISA.46.8	Remember this, you guilty ones.
ISA.46.9	Remember the things I have done in the past.
ISA.46.9	For I alone am God!
ISA.46.9	I am God, and there is none like me.
ISA.46.10	Only I can tell you the future
ISA.46.10	before it even happens.
ISA.46.10	Everything I plan will come to pass,
ISA.46.10	for I do whatever I wish.
ISA.46.11	I will call a swift bird of prey from the east—
ISA.46.11	a leader from a distant land to come and do my bidding.
ISA.46.11	I have said what I would do,
ISA.46.11	and I will do it.
ISA.46.12	“Listen to me, you stubborn people
ISA.46.12	who are so far from doing right.
ISA.46.13	For I am ready to set things right,
ISA.46.13	not in the distant future, but right now!
ISA.46.13	I am ready to save Jerusalem
ISA.46.13	and show my glory to Israel.
ISA.47.1	“Come down, virgin daughter of Babylon, and sit in the dust.
ISA.47.1	For your days of sitting on a throne have ended.
ISA.47.1	O daughter of Babylonia,
ISA.47.1	the lovely princess, tender and delicate.
ISA.47.2	Take heavy millstones and grind flour.
ISA.47.2	Remove your veil, and strip off your robe.
ISA.47.2	Expose yourself to public view.
ISA.47.3	You will be naked and burdened with shame.
ISA.47.3	I will take vengeance against you without pity.”
ISA.47.4	Our Redeemer, whose name is the 
ISA.47.4	is the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.47.5	“O beautiful Babylon, sit now in darkness and silence.
ISA.47.5	Never again will you be known as the queen of kingdoms.
ISA.47.6	For I was angry with my chosen people
ISA.47.6	and punished them by letting them fall into your hands.
ISA.47.6	But you, Babylon, showed them no mercy.
ISA.47.6	You oppressed even the elderly.
ISA.47.7	You said, ‘I will reign forever as queen of the world!’
ISA.47.7	You did not reflect on your actions
ISA.47.7	or think about their consequences.
ISA.47.8	“Listen to this, you pleasure-loving kingdom,
ISA.47.8	living at ease and feeling secure.
ISA.47.8	You say, ‘I am the only one, and there is no other.
ISA.47.8	I will never be a widow or lose my children.’
ISA.47.9	Well, both these things will come upon you in a moment:
ISA.47.9	widowhood and the loss of your children.
ISA.47.9	Yes, these calamities will come upon you,
ISA.47.9	despite all your witchcraft and magic.
ISA.47.10	“You felt secure in your wickedness.
ISA.47.10	‘No one sees me,’ you said.
ISA.47.10	But your ‘wisdom’ and ‘knowledge’ have led you astray,
ISA.47.10	and you said, ‘I am the only one, and there is no other.’
ISA.47.11	So disaster will overtake you,
ISA.47.11	and you won’t be able to charm it away.
ISA.47.11	Calamity will fall upon you,
ISA.47.11	and you won’t be able to buy your way out.
ISA.47.11	A catastrophe will strike you suddenly,
ISA.47.11	one for which you are not prepared.
ISA.47.12	“Now use your magical charms!
ISA.47.12	Use the spells you have worked at all these years!
ISA.47.12	Maybe they will do you some good.
ISA.47.12	Maybe they can make someone afraid of you.
ISA.47.13	All the advice you receive has made you tired.
ISA.47.13	Where are all your astrologers,
ISA.47.13	those stargazers who make predictions each month?
ISA.47.13	Let them stand up and save you from what the future holds.
ISA.47.14	But they are like straw burning in a fire;
ISA.47.14	they cannot save themselves from the flame.
ISA.47.14	You will get no help from them at all;
ISA.47.14	their hearth is no place to sit for warmth.
ISA.47.15	And all your friends,
ISA.47.15	those with whom you’ve done business since childhood,
ISA.47.15	will go their own ways,
ISA.47.15	turning a deaf ear to your cries.
ISA.48.1	“Listen to me, O family of Jacob,
ISA.48.1	you who are called by the name of Israel
ISA.48.1	and born into the family of Judah.
ISA.48.1	Listen, you who take oaths in the name of the 
ISA.48.1	and call on the God of Israel.
ISA.48.1	You don’t keep your promises,
ISA.48.2	even though you call yourself the holy city
ISA.48.2	and talk about depending on the God of Israel,
ISA.48.2	whose name is the 
ISA.48.3	Long ago I told you what was going to happen.
ISA.48.3	Then suddenly I took action,
ISA.48.3	and all my predictions came true.
ISA.48.4	For I know how stubborn and obstinate you are.
ISA.48.4	Your necks are as unbending as iron.
ISA.48.4	Your heads are as hard as bronze.
ISA.48.5	That is why I told you what would happen;
ISA.48.5	I told you beforehand what I was going to do.
ISA.48.5	Then you could never say, ‘My idols did it.
ISA.48.5	My wooden image and metal god commanded it to happen!’
ISA.48.6	You have heard my predictions and seen them fulfilled,
ISA.48.6	but you refuse to admit it.
ISA.48.6	Now I will tell you new things,
ISA.48.6	secrets you have not yet heard.
ISA.48.7	They are brand new, not things from the past.
ISA.48.7	So you cannot say, ‘We knew that all the time!’
ISA.48.8	“Yes, I will tell you of things that are entirely new,
ISA.48.8	things you never heard of before.
ISA.48.8	For I know so well what traitors you are.
ISA.48.8	You have been rebels from birth.
ISA.48.9	Yet for my own sake and for the honor of my name,
ISA.48.9	I will hold back my anger and not wipe you out.
ISA.48.10	I have refined you, but not as silver is refined.
ISA.48.10	Rather, I have refined you in the furnace of suffering.
ISA.48.11	I will rescue you for my sake—
ISA.48.11	yes, for my own sake!
ISA.48.11	I will not let my reputation be tarnished,
ISA.48.11	and I will not share my glory with idols!
ISA.48.12	“Listen to me, O family of Jacob,
ISA.48.12	Israel my chosen one!
ISA.48.12	I alone am God,
ISA.48.12	the First and the Last.
ISA.48.13	It was my hand that laid the foundations of the earth,
ISA.48.13	my right hand that spread out the heavens above.
ISA.48.13	When I call out the stars,
ISA.48.13	they all appear in order.”
ISA.48.14	Have any of your idols ever told you this?
ISA.48.14	Come, all of you, and listen:
ISA.48.14	The 
ISA.48.14	He will use him to put an end to the empire of Babylon
ISA.48.14	and to destroy the Babylonian
ISA.48.15	“I have said it: I am calling Cyrus!
ISA.48.15	I will send him on this errand and will help him succeed.
ISA.48.16	Come closer, and listen to this.
ISA.48.16	From the beginning I have told you plainly what would happen.”
ISA.48.16	And now the Sovereign 
ISA.48.16	have sent me with this message.
ISA.48.17	This is what the 
ISA.48.17	your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
ISA.48.17	“I am the 
ISA.48.17	who teaches you what is good for you
ISA.48.17	and leads you along the paths you should follow.
ISA.48.18	Oh, that you had listened to my commands!
ISA.48.18	Then you would have had peace flowing like a gentle river
ISA.48.18	and righteousness rolling over you like waves in the sea.
ISA.48.19	Your descendants would have been like the sands along the seashore—
ISA.48.19	too many to count!
ISA.48.19	There would have been no need for your destruction,
ISA.48.19	or for cutting off your family name.”
ISA.48.20	Yet even now, be free from your captivity!
ISA.48.20	Leave Babylon and the Babylonians.
ISA.48.20	Sing out this message!
ISA.48.20	Shout it to the ends of the earth!
ISA.48.20	The 
ISA.48.20	the people of Israel.
ISA.48.21	They were not thirsty
ISA.48.21	when he led them through the desert.
ISA.48.21	He divided the rock,
ISA.48.21	and water gushed out for them to drink.
ISA.48.22	“But there is no peace for the wicked,”
ISA.48.22	says the 
ISA.49.1	Listen to me, all you in distant lands!
ISA.49.1	Pay attention, you who are far away!
ISA.49.1	The 
ISA.49.1	from within the womb he called me by name.
ISA.49.2	He made my words of judgment as sharp as a sword.
ISA.49.2	He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand.
ISA.49.2	I am like a sharp arrow in his quiver.
ISA.49.3	He said to me, “You are my servant, Israel,
ISA.49.3	and you will bring me glory.”
ISA.49.4	I replied, “But my work seems so useless!
ISA.49.4	I have spent my strength for nothing and to no purpose.
ISA.49.4	Yet I leave it all in the 
ISA.49.4	I will trust God for my reward.”
ISA.49.5	And now the 
ISA.49.5	the one who formed me in my mother’s womb to be his servant,
ISA.49.5	who commissioned me to bring Israel back to him.
ISA.49.5	The 
ISA.49.5	and my God has given me strength.
ISA.49.6	He says, “You will do more than restore the people of Israel to me.
ISA.49.6	I will make you a light to the Gentiles,
ISA.49.6	and you will bring my salvation to the ends of the earth.”
ISA.49.7	The 
ISA.49.7	and Holy One of Israel,
ISA.49.7	says to the one who is despised and rejected by the nations,
ISA.49.7	to the one who is the servant of rulers:
ISA.49.7	“Kings will stand at attention when you pass by.
ISA.49.7	Princes will also bow low
ISA.49.7	because of the 
ISA.49.7	the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”
ISA.49.8	This is what the 
ISA.49.8	“At just the right time, I will respond to you.
ISA.49.8	On the day of salvation I will help you.
ISA.49.8	I will protect you and give you to the people
ISA.49.8	as my covenant with them.
ISA.49.8	Through you I will reestablish the land of Israel
ISA.49.8	and assign it to its own people again.
ISA.49.9	I will say to the prisoners, ‘Come out in freedom,’
ISA.49.9	and to those in darkness, ‘Come into the light.’
ISA.49.9	They will be my sheep, grazing in green pastures
ISA.49.9	and on hills that were previously bare.
ISA.49.10	They will neither hunger nor thirst.
ISA.49.10	The searing sun will not reach them anymore.
ISA.49.10	For the 
ISA.49.10	he will lead them beside cool waters.
ISA.49.11	And I will make my mountains into level paths for them.
ISA.49.11	The highways will be raised above the valleys.
ISA.49.12	See, my people will return from far away,
ISA.49.12	from lands to the north and west,
ISA.49.12	and from as far south as Egypt.
ISA.49.13	Sing for joy, O heavens!
ISA.49.13	Rejoice, O earth!
ISA.49.13	Burst into song, O mountains!
ISA.49.13	For the 
ISA.49.13	and will have compassion on them in their suffering.
ISA.49.14	Yet Jerusalem
ISA.49.14	the Lord has forgotten us.”
ISA.49.15	“Never! Can a mother forget her nursing child?
ISA.49.15	Can she feel no love for the child she has borne?
ISA.49.15	But even if that were possible,
ISA.49.15	I would not forget you!
ISA.49.16	See, I have written your name on the palms of my hands.
ISA.49.16	Always in my mind is a picture of Jerusalem’s walls in ruins.
ISA.49.17	Soon your descendants will come back,
ISA.49.17	and all who are trying to destroy you will go away.
ISA.49.18	Look around you and see,
ISA.49.18	for all your children will come back to you.
ISA.49.18	As surely as I live,” says the 
ISA.49.18	“they will be like jewels or bridal ornaments for you to display.
ISA.49.19	“Even the most desolate parts of your abandoned land
ISA.49.19	will soon be crowded with your people.
ISA.49.19	Your enemies who enslaved you
ISA.49.19	will be far away.
ISA.49.20	The generations born in exile will return and say,
ISA.49.20	‘We need more room! It’s crowded here!’
ISA.49.21	Then you will think to yourself,
ISA.49.21	‘Who has given me all these descendants?
ISA.49.21	For most of my children were killed,
ISA.49.21	and the rest were carried away into exile.
ISA.49.21	I was left here all alone.
ISA.49.21	Where did all these people come from?
ISA.49.21	Who bore these children?
ISA.49.21	Who raised them for me?’”
ISA.49.22	This is what the Sovereign 
ISA.49.22	“See, I will give a signal to the godless nations.
ISA.49.22	They will carry your little sons back to you in their arms;
ISA.49.22	they will bring your daughters on their shoulders.
ISA.49.23	Kings and queens will serve you
ISA.49.23	and care for all your needs.
ISA.49.23	They will bow to the earth before you
ISA.49.23	and lick the dust from your feet.
ISA.49.23	Then you will know that I am the 
ISA.49.23	Those who trust in me will never be put to shame.”
ISA.49.24	Who can snatch the plunder of war from the hands of a warrior?
ISA.49.24	Who can demand that a tyrant
ISA.49.25	But the 
ISA.49.25	“The captives of warriors will be released,
ISA.49.25	and the plunder of tyrants will be retrieved.
ISA.49.25	For I will fight those who fight you,
ISA.49.25	and I will save your children.
ISA.49.26	I will feed your enemies with their own flesh.
ISA.49.26	They will be drunk with rivers of their own blood.
ISA.49.26	All the world will know that I, the 
ISA.49.26	am your Savior and your Redeemer,
ISA.49.26	the Mighty One of Israel.
ISA.50.1	This is what the 
ISA.50.1	“Was your mother sent away because I divorced her?
ISA.50.1	Did I sell you as slaves to my creditors?
ISA.50.1	No, you were sold because of your sins.
ISA.50.1	And your mother, too, was taken because of your sins.
ISA.50.2	Why was no one there when I came?
ISA.50.2	Why didn’t anyone answer when I called?
ISA.50.2	Is it because I have no power to rescue?
ISA.50.2	No, that is not the reason!
ISA.50.2	For I can speak to the sea and make it dry up!
ISA.50.2	I can turn rivers into deserts covered with dying fish.
ISA.50.3	I dress the skies in darkness,
ISA.50.3	covering them with clothes of mourning.”
ISA.50.4	The Sovereign 
ISA.50.4	so that I know how to comfort the weary.
ISA.50.4	Morning by morning he wakens me
ISA.50.4	and opens my understanding to his will.
ISA.50.5	The Sovereign 
ISA.50.5	and I have listened.
ISA.50.5	I have not rebelled or turned away.
ISA.50.6	I offered my back to those who beat me
ISA.50.6	and my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard.
ISA.50.6	I did not hide my face
ISA.50.6	from mockery and spitting.
ISA.50.7	Because the Sovereign 
ISA.50.7	I will not be disgraced.
ISA.50.7	Therefore, I have set my face like a stone,
ISA.50.7	determined to do his will.
ISA.50.7	And I know that I will not be put to shame.
ISA.50.8	He who gives me justice is near.
ISA.50.8	Who will dare to bring charges against me now?
ISA.50.8	Where are my accusers?
ISA.50.8	Let them appear!
ISA.50.9	See, the Sovereign 
ISA.50.9	Who will declare me guilty?
ISA.50.9	All my enemies will be destroyed
ISA.50.9	like old clothes that have been eaten by moths!
ISA.50.10	Who among you fears the 
ISA.50.10	and obeys his servant?
ISA.50.10	If you are walking in darkness,
ISA.50.10	without a ray of light,
ISA.50.10	trust in the 
ISA.50.10	and rely on your God.
ISA.50.11	But watch out, you who live in your own light
ISA.50.11	and warm yourselves by your own fires.
ISA.50.11	This is the reward you will receive from me:
ISA.50.11	You will soon fall down in great torment.
ISA.51.1	“Listen to me, all who hope for deliverance—
ISA.51.1	all who seek the 
ISA.51.1	Consider the rock from which you were cut,
ISA.51.1	the quarry from which you were mined.
ISA.51.2	Yes, think about Abraham, your ancestor,
ISA.51.2	and Sarah, who gave birth to your nation.
ISA.51.2	Abraham was only one man when I called him.
ISA.51.2	But when I blessed him, he became a great nation.”
ISA.51.3	The 
ISA.51.3	and have pity on her ruins.
ISA.51.3	Her desert will blossom like Eden,
ISA.51.3	her barren wilderness like the garden of the 
ISA.51.3	Joy and gladness will be found there.
ISA.51.3	Songs of thanksgiving will fill the air.
ISA.51.4	“Listen to me, my people.
ISA.51.4	Hear me, Israel,
ISA.51.4	for my law will be proclaimed,
ISA.51.4	and my justice will become a light to the nations.
ISA.51.5	My mercy and justice are coming soon.
ISA.51.5	My salvation is on the way.
ISA.51.5	My strong arm will bring justice to the nations.
ISA.51.5	All distant lands will look to me
ISA.51.5	and wait in hope for my powerful arm.
ISA.51.6	Look up to the skies above,
ISA.51.6	and gaze down on the earth below.
ISA.51.6	For the skies will disappear like smoke,
ISA.51.6	and the earth will wear out like a piece of clothing.
ISA.51.6	The people of the earth will die like flies,
ISA.51.6	but my salvation lasts forever.
ISA.51.6	My righteous rule will never end!
ISA.51.7	“Listen to me, you who know right from wrong,
ISA.51.7	you who cherish my law in your hearts.
ISA.51.7	Do not be afraid of people’s scorn,
ISA.51.7	nor fear their insults.
ISA.51.8	For the moth will devour them as it devours clothing.
ISA.51.8	The worm will eat at them as it eats wool.
ISA.51.8	But my righteousness will last forever.
ISA.51.8	My salvation will continue from generation to generation.”
ISA.51.9	Wake up, wake up, O 
ISA.51.9	Flex your mighty right arm!
ISA.51.9	Rouse yourself as in the days of old
ISA.51.9	when you slew Egypt, the dragon of the Nile.
ISA.51.10	Are you not the same today,
ISA.51.10	the one who dried up the sea,
ISA.51.10	making a path of escape through the depths
ISA.51.10	so that your people could cross over?
ISA.51.11	Those who have been ransomed by the 
ISA.51.11	They will enter Jerusalem
ISA.51.11	crowned with everlasting joy.
ISA.51.11	Sorrow and mourning will disappear,
ISA.51.11	and they will be filled with joy and gladness.
ISA.51.12	“I, yes I, am the one who comforts you.
ISA.51.12	So why are you afraid of mere humans,
ISA.51.12	who wither like the grass and disappear?
ISA.51.13	Yet you have forgotten the 
ISA.51.13	the one who stretched out the sky like a canopy
ISA.51.13	and laid the foundations of the earth.
ISA.51.13	Will you remain in constant dread of human oppressors?
ISA.51.13	Will you continue to fear the anger of your enemies?
ISA.51.13	Where is their fury and anger now?
ISA.51.13	It is gone!
ISA.51.14	Soon all you captives will be released!
ISA.51.14	Imprisonment, starvation, and death will not be your fate!
ISA.51.15	For I am the 
ISA.51.15	who stirs up the sea, causing its waves to roar.
ISA.51.15	My name is the 
ISA.51.16	And I have put my words in your mouth
ISA.51.16	and hidden you safely in my hand.
ISA.51.16	I stretched out
ISA.51.16	and laid the foundations of the earth.
ISA.51.16	I am the one who says to Israel,
ISA.51.16	‘You are my people!’”
ISA.51.17	Wake up, wake up, O Jerusalem!
ISA.51.17	You have drunk the cup of the 
ISA.51.17	You have drunk the cup of terror,
ISA.51.17	tipping out its last drops.
ISA.51.18	Not one of your children is left alive
ISA.51.18	to take your hand and guide you.
ISA.51.19	These two calamities have fallen on you:
ISA.51.19	desolation and destruction, famine and war.
ISA.51.19	And who is left to sympathize with you?
ISA.51.19	Who is left to comfort you?
ISA.51.20	For your children have fainted and lie in the streets,
ISA.51.20	helpless as antelopes caught in a net.
ISA.51.20	The 
ISA.51.20	God has rebuked them.
ISA.51.21	But now listen to this, you afflicted ones
ISA.51.21	who sit in a drunken stupor,
ISA.51.21	though not from drinking wine.
ISA.51.22	This is what the Sovereign 
ISA.51.22	your God and Defender, says:
ISA.51.22	“See, I have taken the terrible cup from your hands.
ISA.51.22	You will drink no more of my fury.
ISA.51.23	Instead, I will hand that cup to your tormentors,
ISA.51.23	those who said, ‘We will trample you into the dust
ISA.51.23	and walk on your backs.’”
ISA.52.1	Wake up, wake up, O Zion!
ISA.52.1	Clothe yourself with strength.
ISA.52.1	Put on your beautiful clothes, O holy city of Jerusalem,
ISA.52.1	for unclean and godless people will enter your gates no longer.
ISA.52.2	Rise from the dust, O Jerusalem.
ISA.52.2	Sit in a place of honor.
ISA.52.2	Remove the chains of slavery from your neck,
ISA.52.2	O captive daughter of Zion.
ISA.52.3	For this is what the 
ISA.52.3	“When I sold you into exile,
ISA.52.3	I received no payment.
ISA.52.3	Now I can redeem you
ISA.52.3	without having to pay for you.”
ISA.52.4	This is what the Sovereign 
ISA.52.5	What is this?” asks the 
ISA.52.6	But I will reveal my name to my people, and they will come to know its power. Then at last they will recognize that I am the one who speaks to them.”
ISA.52.7	How beautiful on the mountains
ISA.52.7	are the feet of the messenger who brings good news,
ISA.52.7	the good news of peace and salvation,
ISA.52.7	the news that the God of Israel
ISA.52.8	The watchmen shout and sing with joy,
ISA.52.8	for before their very eyes
ISA.52.8	they see the 
ISA.52.9	Let the ruins of Jerusalem break into joyful song,
ISA.52.9	for the 
ISA.52.9	He has redeemed Jerusalem.
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.10	before the eyes of all the nations.
ISA.52.10	All the ends of the earth will see
ISA.52.10	the victory of our God.
ISA.52.11	Get out! Get out and leave your captivity,
ISA.52.11	where everything you touch is unclean.
ISA.52.11	Get out of there and purify yourselves,
ISA.52.11	you who carry home the sacred objects of the 
ISA.52.12	You will not leave in a hurry,
ISA.52.12	running for your lives.
ISA.52.12	For the 
ISA.52.12	yes, the God of Israel will protect you from behind.
ISA.52.13	See, my servant will prosper;
ISA.52.13	he will be highly exalted.
ISA.52.14	But many were amazed when they saw him.
ISA.52.14	His face was so disfigured he seemed hardly human,
ISA.52.14	and from his appearance, one would scarcely know he was a man.
ISA.52.15	And he will startle
ISA.52.15	Kings will stand speechless in his presence.
ISA.52.15	For they will see what they had not been told;
ISA.52.15	they will understand what they had not heard about.
ISA.53.1	Who has believed our message?
ISA.53.1	To whom has the 
ISA.53.2	My servant grew up in the 
ISA.53.2	like a root in dry ground.
ISA.53.2	There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance,
ISA.53.2	nothing to attract us to him.
ISA.53.3	He was despised and rejected—
ISA.53.3	a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief.
ISA.53.3	We turned our backs on him and looked the other way.
ISA.53.3	He was despised, and we did not care.
ISA.53.4	Yet it was our weaknesses he carried;
ISA.53.4	it was our sorrows
ISA.53.4	And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God,
ISA.53.4	a punishment for his own sins!
ISA.53.5	But he was pierced for our rebellion,
ISA.53.5	crushed for our sins.
ISA.53.5	He was beaten so we could be whole.
ISA.53.5	He was whipped so we could be healed.
ISA.53.6	All of us, like sheep, have strayed away.
ISA.53.6	We have left God’s paths to follow our own.
ISA.53.6	Yet the 
ISA.53.6	the sins of us all.
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed and treated harshly,
ISA.53.7	yet he never said a word.
ISA.53.7	He was led like a lamb to the slaughter.
ISA.53.7	And as a sheep is silent before the shearers,
ISA.53.7	he did not open his mouth.
ISA.53.8	Unjustly condemned,
ISA.53.8	he was led away.
ISA.53.8	No one cared that he died without descendants,
ISA.53.8	that his life was cut short in midstream.
ISA.53.8	But he was struck down
ISA.53.8	for the rebellion of my people.
ISA.53.9	He had done no wrong
ISA.53.9	and had never deceived anyone.
ISA.53.9	But he was buried like a criminal;
ISA.53.9	he was put in a rich man’s grave.
ISA.53.10	But it was the 
ISA.53.10	and cause him grief.
ISA.53.10	Yet when his life is made an offering for sin,
ISA.53.10	he will have many descendants.
ISA.53.10	He will enjoy a long life,
ISA.53.10	and the 
ISA.53.11	When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish,
ISA.53.11	he will be satisfied.
ISA.53.11	And because of his experience,
ISA.53.11	my righteous servant will make it possible
ISA.53.11	for many to be counted righteous,
ISA.53.11	for he will bear all their sins.
ISA.53.12	I will give him the honors of a victorious soldier,
ISA.53.12	because he exposed himself to death.
ISA.53.12	He was counted among the rebels.
ISA.53.12	He bore the sins of many and interceded for rebels.
ISA.54.1	“Sing, O childless woman,
ISA.54.1	you who have never given birth!
ISA.54.1	Break into loud and joyful song, O Jerusalem,
ISA.54.1	you who have never been in labor.
ISA.54.1	For the desolate woman now has more children
ISA.54.1	than the woman who lives with her husband,”
ISA.54.1	says the 
ISA.54.2	“Enlarge your house; build an addition.
ISA.54.2	Spread out your home, and spare no expense!
ISA.54.3	For you will soon be bursting at the seams.
ISA.54.3	Your descendants will occupy other nations
ISA.54.3	and resettle the ruined cities.
ISA.54.4	“Fear not; you will no longer live in shame.
ISA.54.4	Don’t be afraid; there is no more disgrace for you.
ISA.54.4	You will no longer remember the shame of your youth
ISA.54.4	and the sorrows of widowhood.
ISA.54.5	For your Creator will be your husband;
ISA.54.5	the 
ISA.54.5	He is your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.54.5	the God of all the earth.
ISA.54.6	For the 
ISA.54.6	as though you were a young wife abandoned by her husband,”
ISA.54.6	says your God.
ISA.54.7	“For a brief moment I abandoned you,
ISA.54.7	but with great compassion I will take you back.
ISA.54.8	In a burst of anger I turned my face away for a little while.
ISA.54.8	But with everlasting love I will have compassion on you,”
ISA.54.8	says the 
ISA.54.9	“Just as I swore in the time of Noah
ISA.54.9	that I would never again let a flood cover the earth,
ISA.54.9	so now I swear
ISA.54.9	that I will never again be angry and punish you.
ISA.54.10	For the mountains may move
ISA.54.10	and the hills disappear,
ISA.54.10	but even then my faithful love for you will remain.
ISA.54.10	My covenant of blessing will never be broken,”
ISA.54.10	says the 
ISA.54.11	“O storm-battered city,
ISA.54.11	troubled and desolate!
ISA.54.11	I will rebuild you with precious jewels
ISA.54.11	and make your foundations from lapis lazuli.
ISA.54.12	I will make your towers of sparkling rubies,
ISA.54.12	your gates of shining gems,
ISA.54.12	and your walls of precious stones.
ISA.54.13	I will teach all your children,
ISA.54.13	and they will enjoy great peace.
ISA.54.14	You will be secure under a government that is just and fair.
ISA.54.14	Your enemies will stay far away.
ISA.54.14	You will live in peace,
ISA.54.14	and terror will not come near.
ISA.54.15	If any nation comes to fight you,
ISA.54.15	it is not because I sent them.
ISA.54.15	Whoever attacks you will go down in defeat.
ISA.54.16	“I have created the blacksmith
ISA.54.16	who fans the coals beneath the forge
ISA.54.16	and makes the weapons of destruction.
ISA.54.16	And I have created the armies that destroy.
ISA.54.17	But in that coming day
ISA.54.17	no weapon turned against you will succeed.
ISA.54.17	You will silence every voice
ISA.54.17	raised up to accuse you.
ISA.54.17	These benefits are enjoyed by the servants of the 
ISA.54.17	their vindication will come from me.
ISA.54.17	I, the 
ISA.55.1	“Is anyone thirsty?
ISA.55.1	Come and drink—
ISA.55.1	even if you have no money!
ISA.55.1	Come, take your choice of wine or milk—
ISA.55.1	it’s all free!
ISA.55.2	Why spend your money on food that does not give you strength?
ISA.55.2	Why pay for food that does you no good?
ISA.55.2	Listen to me, and you will eat what is good.
ISA.55.2	You will enjoy the finest food.
ISA.55.3	“Come to me with your ears wide open.
ISA.55.3	Listen, and you will find life.
ISA.55.3	I will make an everlasting covenant with you.
ISA.55.3	I will give you all the unfailing love I promised to David.
ISA.55.4	See how I used him to display my power among the peoples.
ISA.55.4	I made him a leader among the nations.
ISA.55.5	You also will command nations you do not know,
ISA.55.5	and peoples unknown to you will come running to obey,
ISA.55.5	because I, the 
ISA.55.5	the Holy One of Israel, have made you glorious.”
ISA.55.6	Seek the 
ISA.55.6	Call on him now while he is near.
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked change their ways
ISA.55.7	and banish the very thought of doing wrong.
ISA.55.7	Let them turn to the 
ISA.55.7	Yes, turn to our God, for he will forgive generously.
ISA.55.8	“My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts,” says the 
ISA.55.8	“And my ways are far beyond anything you could imagine.
ISA.55.9	For just as the heavens are higher than the earth,
ISA.55.9	so my ways are higher than your ways
ISA.55.9	and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.
ISA.55.10	“The rain and snow come down from the heavens
ISA.55.10	and stay on the ground to water the earth.
ISA.55.10	They cause the grain to grow,
ISA.55.10	producing seed for the farmer
ISA.55.10	and bread for the hungry.
ISA.55.11	It is the same with my word.
ISA.55.11	I send it out, and it always produces fruit.
ISA.55.11	It will accomplish all I want it to,
ISA.55.11	and it will prosper everywhere I send it.
ISA.55.12	You will live in joy and peace.
ISA.55.12	The mountains and hills will burst into song,
ISA.55.12	and the trees of the field will clap their hands!
ISA.55.13	Where once there were thorns, cypress trees will grow.
ISA.55.13	Where nettles grew, myrtles will sprout up.
ISA.55.13	These events will bring great honor to the 
ISA.55.13	they will be an everlasting sign of his power and love.”
ISA.56.1	This is what the 
ISA.56.1	“Be just and fair to all.
ISA.56.1	Do what is right and good,
ISA.56.1	for I am coming soon to rescue you
ISA.56.1	and to display my righteousness among you.
ISA.56.2	Blessed are all those
ISA.56.2	who are careful to do this.
ISA.56.2	Blessed are those who honor my Sabbath days of rest
ISA.56.2	and keep themselves from doing wrong.
ISA.56.3	“Don’t let foreigners who commit themselves to the 
ISA.56.3	‘The 
ISA.56.3	And don’t let the eunuchs say,
ISA.56.3	‘I’m a dried-up tree with no children and no future.’
ISA.56.4	For this is what the 
ISA.56.4	I will bless those eunuchs
ISA.56.4	who keep my Sabbath days holy
ISA.56.4	and who choose to do what pleases me
ISA.56.4	and commit their lives to me.
ISA.56.5	I will give them—within the walls of my house—
ISA.56.5	a memorial and a name
ISA.56.5	far greater than sons and daughters could give.
ISA.56.5	For the name I give them is an everlasting one.
ISA.56.5	It will never disappear!
ISA.56.6	“I will also bless the foreigners who commit themselves to the 
ISA.56.6	who serve him and love his name,
ISA.56.6	who worship him and do not desecrate the Sabbath day of rest,
ISA.56.6	and who hold fast to my covenant.
ISA.56.7	I will bring them to my holy mountain of Jerusalem
ISA.56.7	and will fill them with joy in my house of prayer.
ISA.56.7	I will accept their burnt offerings and sacrifices,
ISA.56.7	because my Temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations.
ISA.56.8	For the Sovereign 
ISA.56.8	who brings back the outcasts of Israel, says:
ISA.56.8	I will bring others, too,
ISA.56.8	besides my people Israel.”
ISA.56.9	Come, wild animals of the field!
ISA.56.9	Come, wild animals of the forest!
ISA.56.9	Come and devour my people!
ISA.56.10	For the leaders of my people—
ISA.56.10	the 
ISA.56.10	are blind and ignorant.
ISA.56.10	They are like silent watchdogs
ISA.56.10	that give no warning when danger comes.
ISA.56.10	They love to lie around, sleeping and dreaming.
ISA.56.11	Like greedy dogs, they are never satisfied.
ISA.56.11	They are ignorant shepherds,
ISA.56.11	all following their own path
ISA.56.11	and intent on personal gain.
ISA.56.12	“Come,” they say, “let’s get some wine and have a party.
ISA.56.12	Let’s all get drunk.
ISA.56.12	Then tomorrow we’ll do it again
ISA.56.12	and have an even bigger party!”
ISA.57.1	Good people pass away;
ISA.57.1	the godly often die before their time.
ISA.57.1	But no one seems to care or wonder why.
ISA.57.1	No one seems to understand
ISA.57.1	that God is protecting them from the evil to come.
ISA.57.2	For those who follow godly paths
ISA.57.2	will rest in peace when they die.
ISA.57.3	“But you—come here, you witches’ children,
ISA.57.3	you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!
ISA.57.4	Whom do you mock,
ISA.57.4	making faces and sticking out your tongues?
ISA.57.4	You children of sinners and liars!
ISA.57.5	You worship your idols with great passion
ISA.57.5	beneath the oaks and under every green tree.
ISA.57.5	You sacrifice your children down in the valleys,
ISA.57.5	among the jagged rocks in the cliffs.
ISA.57.6	Your gods are the smooth stones in the valleys.
ISA.57.6	You worship them with liquid offerings and grain offerings.
ISA.57.6	They, not I, are your inheritance.
ISA.57.6	Do you think all this makes me happy?
ISA.57.7	You have committed adultery on every high mountain.
ISA.57.7	There you have worshiped idols
ISA.57.7	and have been unfaithful to me.
ISA.57.8	You have put pagan symbols
ISA.57.8	on your doorposts and behind your doors.
ISA.57.8	You have left me
ISA.57.8	and climbed into bed with these detestable gods.
ISA.57.8	You have committed yourselves to them.
ISA.57.8	You love to look at their naked bodies.
ISA.57.9	You have gone to Molech
ISA.57.9	with olive oil and many perfumes,
ISA.57.9	sending your agents far and wide,
ISA.57.9	even to the world of the dead.
ISA.57.10	You grew weary in your search,
ISA.57.10	but you never gave up.
ISA.57.10	Desire gave you renewed strength,
ISA.57.10	and you did not grow weary.
ISA.57.11	“Are you afraid of these idols?
ISA.57.11	Do they terrify you?
ISA.57.11	Is that why you have lied to me
ISA.57.11	and forgotten me and my words?
ISA.57.11	Is it because of my long silence
ISA.57.11	that you no longer fear me?
ISA.57.12	Now I will expose your so-called good deeds.
ISA.57.12	None of them will help you.
ISA.57.13	Let’s see if your idols can save you
ISA.57.13	when you cry to them for help.
ISA.57.13	Why, a puff of wind can knock them down!
ISA.57.13	If you just breathe on them, they fall over!
ISA.57.13	But whoever trusts in me will inherit the land
ISA.57.13	and possess my holy mountain.”
ISA.57.14	God says, “Rebuild the road!
ISA.57.14	Clear away the rocks and stones
ISA.57.14	so my people can return from captivity.”
ISA.57.15	The high and lofty one who lives in eternity,
ISA.57.15	the Holy One, says this:
ISA.57.15	“I live in the high and holy place
ISA.57.15	with those whose spirits are contrite and humble.
ISA.57.15	I restore the crushed spirit of the humble
ISA.57.15	and revive the courage of those with repentant hearts.
ISA.57.16	For I will not fight against you forever;
ISA.57.16	I will not always be angry.
ISA.57.16	If I were, all people would pass away—
ISA.57.16	all the souls I have made.
ISA.57.17	I was angry,
ISA.57.17	so I punished these greedy people.
ISA.57.17	I withdrew from them,
ISA.57.17	but they kept going on their own stubborn way.
ISA.57.18	I have seen what they do,
ISA.57.18	but I will heal them anyway!
ISA.57.18	I will lead them.
ISA.57.18	I will comfort those who mourn,
ISA.57.19	bringing words of praise to their lips.
ISA.57.19	May they have abundant peace, both near and far,”
ISA.57.19	says the 
ISA.57.20	“But those who still reject me are like the restless sea,
ISA.57.20	which is never still
ISA.57.20	but continually churns up mud and dirt.
ISA.57.21	There is no peace for the wicked,”
ISA.57.21	says my God.
ISA.58.1	“Shout with the voice of a trumpet blast.
ISA.58.1	Shout aloud! Don’t be timid.
ISA.58.1	Tell my people Israel
ISA.58.2	Yet they act so pious!
ISA.58.2	They come to the Temple every day
ISA.58.2	and seem delighted to learn all about me.
ISA.58.2	They act like a righteous nation
ISA.58.2	that would never abandon the laws of its God.
ISA.58.2	They ask me to take action on their behalf,
ISA.58.2	pretending they want to be near me.
ISA.58.3	‘We have fasted before you!’ they say.
ISA.58.3	‘Why aren’t you impressed?
ISA.58.3	We have been very hard on ourselves,
ISA.58.3	and you don’t even notice it!’
ISA.58.3	“I will tell you why!” I respond.
ISA.58.3	“It’s because you are fasting to please yourselves.
ISA.58.3	Even while you fast,
ISA.58.3	you keep oppressing your workers.
ISA.58.4	What good is fasting
ISA.58.4	when you keep on fighting and quarreling?
ISA.58.4	This kind of fasting
ISA.58.4	will never get you anywhere with me.
ISA.58.5	You humble yourselves
ISA.58.5	by going through the motions of penance,
ISA.58.5	bowing your heads
ISA.58.5	like reeds bending in the wind.
ISA.58.5	You dress in burlap
ISA.58.5	and cover yourselves with ashes.
ISA.58.5	Is this what you call fasting?
ISA.58.5	Do you really think this will please the 
ISA.58.6	“No, this is the kind of fasting I want:
ISA.58.6	Free those who are wrongly imprisoned;
ISA.58.6	lighten the burden of those who work for you.
ISA.58.6	Let the oppressed go free,
ISA.58.6	and remove the chains that bind people.
ISA.58.7	Share your food with the hungry,
ISA.58.7	and give shelter to the homeless.
ISA.58.7	Give clothes to those who need them,
ISA.58.7	and do not hide from relatives who need your help.
ISA.58.8	“Then your salvation will come like the dawn,
ISA.58.8	and your wounds will quickly heal.
ISA.58.8	Your godliness will lead you forward,
ISA.58.8	and the glory of the 
ISA.58.9	Then when you call, the 
ISA.58.9	‘Yes, I am here,’ he will quickly reply.
ISA.58.9	“Remove the heavy yoke of oppression.
ISA.58.9	Stop pointing your finger and spreading vicious rumors!
ISA.58.10	Feed the hungry,
ISA.58.10	and help those in trouble.
ISA.58.10	Then your light will shine out from the darkness,
ISA.58.10	and the darkness around you will be as bright as noon.
ISA.58.11	The 
ISA.58.11	giving you water when you are dry
ISA.58.11	and restoring your strength.
ISA.58.11	You will be like a well-watered garden,
ISA.58.11	like an ever-flowing spring.
ISA.58.12	Some of you will rebuild the deserted ruins of your cities.
ISA.58.12	Then you will be known as a rebuilder of walls
ISA.58.12	and a restorer of homes.
ISA.58.13	“Keep the Sabbath day holy.
ISA.58.13	Don’t pursue your own interests on that day,
ISA.58.13	but enjoy the Sabbath
ISA.58.13	and speak of it with delight as the 
ISA.58.13	Honor the Sabbath in everything you do on that day,
ISA.58.13	and don’t follow your own desires or talk idly.
ISA.58.14	Then the 
ISA.58.14	I will give you great honor
ISA.58.14	and satisfy you with the inheritance I promised to your ancestor Jacob.
ISA.58.14	I, the 
ISA.59.1	Listen! The 
ISA.59.1	nor is his ear too deaf to hear you call.
ISA.59.2	It’s your sins that have cut you off from God.
ISA.59.2	Because of your sins, he has turned away
ISA.59.2	and will not listen anymore.
ISA.59.3	Your hands are the hands of murderers,
ISA.59.3	and your fingers are filthy with sin.
ISA.59.3	Your lips are full of lies,
ISA.59.3	and your mouth spews corruption.
ISA.59.4	No one cares about being fair and honest.
ISA.59.4	The people’s lawsuits are based on lies.
ISA.59.4	They conceive evil deeds
ISA.59.4	and then give birth to sin.
ISA.59.5	They hatch deadly snakes
ISA.59.5	and weave spiders’ webs.
ISA.59.5	Whoever eats their eggs will die;
ISA.59.5	whoever cracks them will hatch a viper.
ISA.59.6	Their webs can’t be made into clothing,
ISA.59.6	and nothing they do is productive.
ISA.59.6	All their activity is filled with sin,
ISA.59.6	and violence is their trademark.
ISA.59.7	Their feet run to do evil,
ISA.59.7	and they rush to commit murder.
ISA.59.7	They think only about sinning.
ISA.59.7	Misery and destruction always follow them.
ISA.59.8	They don’t know where to find peace
ISA.59.8	or what it means to be just and good.
ISA.59.8	They have mapped out crooked roads,
ISA.59.8	and no one who follows them knows a moment’s peace.
ISA.59.9	So there is no justice among us,
ISA.59.9	and we know nothing about right living.
ISA.59.9	We look for light but find only darkness.
ISA.59.9	We look for bright skies but walk in gloom.
ISA.59.10	We grope like the blind along a wall,
ISA.59.10	feeling our way like people without eyes.
ISA.59.10	Even at brightest noontime,
ISA.59.10	we stumble as though it were dark.
ISA.59.10	Among the living,
ISA.59.10	we are like the dead.
ISA.59.11	We growl like hungry bears;
ISA.59.11	we moan like mournful doves.
ISA.59.11	We look for justice, but it never comes.
ISA.59.11	We look for rescue, but it is far away from us.
ISA.59.12	For our sins are piled up before God
ISA.59.12	and testify against us.
ISA.59.12	Yes, we know what sinners we are.
ISA.59.13	We know we have rebelled and have denied the 
ISA.59.13	We have turned our backs on our God.
ISA.59.13	We know how unfair and oppressive we have been,
ISA.59.13	carefully planning our deceitful lies.
ISA.59.14	Our courts oppose the righteous,
ISA.59.14	and justice is nowhere to be found.
ISA.59.14	Truth stumbles in the streets,
ISA.59.14	and honesty has been outlawed.
ISA.59.15	Yes, truth is gone,
ISA.59.15	and anyone who renounces evil is attacked.
ISA.59.15	The 
ISA.59.15	to find there was no justice.
ISA.59.16	He was amazed to see that no one intervened
ISA.59.16	to help the oppressed.
ISA.59.16	So he himself stepped in to save them with his strong arm,
ISA.59.16	and his justice sustained him.
ISA.59.17	He put on righteousness as his body armor
ISA.59.17	and placed the helmet of salvation on his head.
ISA.59.17	He clothed himself with a robe of vengeance
ISA.59.17	and wrapped himself in a cloak of divine passion.
ISA.59.18	He will repay his enemies for their evil deeds.
ISA.59.18	His fury will fall on his foes.
ISA.59.18	He will pay them back even to the ends of the earth.
ISA.59.19	In the west, people will respect the name of the 
ISA.59.19	in the east, they will glorify him.
ISA.59.19	For he will come like a raging flood tide
ISA.59.19	driven by the breath of the 
ISA.59.20	“The Redeemer will come to Jerusalem
ISA.59.20	to buy back those in Israel
ISA.59.20	who have turned from their sins,”
ISA.59.20	says the 
ISA.59.21	“And this is my covenant with them,” says the 
ISA.60.1	“Arise, Jerusalem! Let your light shine for all to see.
ISA.60.1	For the glory of the 
ISA.60.2	Darkness as black as night covers all the nations of the earth,
ISA.60.2	but the glory of the 
ISA.60.3	All nations will come to your light;
ISA.60.3	mighty kings will come to see your radiance.
ISA.60.4	“Look and see, for everyone is coming home!
ISA.60.4	Your sons are coming from distant lands;
ISA.60.4	your little daughters will be carried home.
ISA.60.5	Your eyes will shine,
ISA.60.5	and your heart will thrill with joy,
ISA.60.5	for merchants from around the world will come to you.
ISA.60.5	They will bring you the wealth of many lands.
ISA.60.6	Vast caravans of camels will converge on you,
ISA.60.6	the camels of Midian and Ephah.
ISA.60.6	The people of Sheba will bring gold and frankincense
ISA.60.6	and will come worshiping the 
ISA.60.7	The flocks of Kedar will be given to you,
ISA.60.7	and the rams of Nebaioth will be brought for my altars.
ISA.60.7	I will accept their offerings,
ISA.60.7	and I will make my Temple glorious.
ISA.60.8	“And what do I see flying like clouds to Israel,
ISA.60.8	like doves to their nests?
ISA.60.9	They are ships from the ends of the earth,
ISA.60.9	from lands that trust in me,
ISA.60.9	led by the great ships of Tarshish.
ISA.60.9	They are bringing the people of Israel home from far away,
ISA.60.9	carrying their silver and gold.
ISA.60.9	They will honor the 
ISA.60.9	the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.60.9	for he has filled you with splendor.
ISA.60.10	“Foreigners will come to rebuild your towns,
ISA.60.10	and their kings will serve you.
ISA.60.10	For though I have destroyed you in my anger,
ISA.60.10	I will now have mercy on you through my grace.
ISA.60.11	Your gates will stay open day and night
ISA.60.11	to receive the wealth of many lands.
ISA.60.11	The kings of the world will be led as captives
ISA.60.11	in a victory procession.
ISA.60.12	For the nations that refuse to serve you
ISA.60.12	will be destroyed.
ISA.60.13	“The glory of Lebanon will be yours—
ISA.60.13	the forests of cypress, fir, and pine—
ISA.60.13	to beautify my sanctuary.
ISA.60.13	My Temple will be glorious!
ISA.60.14	The descendants of your tormentors
ISA.60.14	will come and bow before you.
ISA.60.14	Those who despised you
ISA.60.14	will kiss your feet.
ISA.60.14	They will call you the City of the 
ISA.60.14	and Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.60.15	“Though you were once despised and hated,
ISA.60.15	with no one traveling through you,
ISA.60.15	I will make you beautiful forever,
ISA.60.15	a joy to all generations.
ISA.60.16	Powerful kings and mighty nations
ISA.60.16	will satisfy your every need,
ISA.60.16	as though you were a child
ISA.60.16	nursing at the breast of a queen.
ISA.60.16	You will know at last that I, the 
ISA.60.16	am your Savior and your Redeemer,
ISA.60.16	the Mighty One of Israel.
ISA.60.17	I will exchange your bronze for gold,
ISA.60.17	your iron for silver,
ISA.60.17	your wood for bronze,
ISA.60.17	and your stones for iron.
ISA.60.17	I will make peace your leader
ISA.60.17	and righteousness your ruler.
ISA.60.18	Violence will disappear from your land;
ISA.60.18	the desolation and destruction of war will end.
ISA.60.18	Salvation will surround you like city walls,
ISA.60.18	and praise will be on the lips of all who enter there.
ISA.60.19	“No longer will you need the sun to shine by day,
ISA.60.19	nor the moon to give its light by night,
ISA.60.19	for the 
ISA.60.19	and your God will be your glory.
ISA.60.20	Your sun will never set;
ISA.60.20	your moon will not go down.
ISA.60.20	For the 
ISA.60.20	Your days of mourning will come to an end.
ISA.60.21	All your people will be righteous.
ISA.60.21	They will possess their land forever,
ISA.60.21	for I will plant them there with my own hands
ISA.60.21	in order to bring myself glory.
ISA.60.22	The smallest family will become a thousand people,
ISA.60.22	and the tiniest group will become a mighty nation.
ISA.60.22	At the right time, I, the 
ISA.61.1	The Spirit of the Sovereign 
ISA.61.1	for the 
ISA.61.1	to bring good news to the poor.
ISA.61.1	He has sent me to comfort the brokenhearted
ISA.61.1	and to proclaim that captives will be released
ISA.61.1	and prisoners will be freed.
ISA.61.2	He has sent me to tell those who mourn
ISA.61.2	that the time of the 
ISA.61.2	and with it, the day of God’s anger against their enemies.
ISA.61.3	To all who mourn in Israel,
ISA.61.3	he will give a crown of beauty for ashes,
ISA.61.3	a joyous blessing instead of mourning,
ISA.61.3	festive praise instead of despair.
ISA.61.3	In their righteousness, they will be like great oaks
ISA.61.3	that the 
ISA.61.4	They will rebuild the ancient ruins,
ISA.61.4	repairing cities destroyed long ago.
ISA.61.4	They will revive them,
ISA.61.4	though they have been deserted for many generations.
ISA.61.5	Foreigners will be your servants.
ISA.61.5	They will feed your flocks
ISA.61.5	and plow your fields
ISA.61.5	and tend your vineyards.
ISA.61.6	You will be called priests of the 
ISA.61.6	ministers of our God.
ISA.61.6	You will feed on the treasures of the nations
ISA.61.6	and boast in their riches.
ISA.61.7	Instead of shame and dishonor,
ISA.61.7	you will enjoy a double share of honor.
ISA.61.7	You will possess a double portion of prosperity in your land,
ISA.61.7	and everlasting joy will be yours.
ISA.61.8	“For I, the 
ISA.61.8	I hate robbery and wrongdoing.
ISA.61.8	I will faithfully reward my people for their suffering
ISA.61.8	and make an everlasting covenant with them.

ISA.61.10	and draped me in a robe of righteousness.
ISA.61.10	I am like a bridegroom dressed for his wedding
ISA.61.10	or a bride with her jewels.
ISA.61.11	The Sovereign 
ISA.61.11	Everyone will praise him!
ISA.61.11	His righteousness will be like a garden in early spring,
ISA.61.11	with plants springing up everywhere.
ISA.62.1	Because I love Zion,
ISA.62.1	I will not keep still.
ISA.62.1	Because my heart yearns for Jerusalem,

ISA.62.1	I will not stop praying for her
ISA.62.1	until her righteousness shines like the dawn,
ISA.62.1	and her salvation blazes like a burning torch.

ISA.62.3	a splendid crown in the hand of God.
ISA.62.4	Never again will you be called “The Forsaken City”
ISA.62.4	or “The Desolate Land.”
ISA.62.4	Your new name will be “The City of God’s Delight”
ISA.62.4	and “The Bride of God,”
ISA.62.4	for the 
ISA.62.4	and will claim you as his bride.
ISA.62.5	Your children will commit themselves to you, O Jerusalem,
ISA.62.5	just as a young man commits himself to his bride.
ISA.62.5	Then God will rejoice over you
ISA.62.5	as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride.
ISA.62.6	O Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen on your walls;
ISA.62.6	they will pray day and night, continually.
ISA.62.6	Take no rest, all you who pray to the 
ISA.62.7	Give the 
ISA.62.7	until he makes Jerusalem the pride of the earth.
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.8	“I will never again hand you over to your enemies.
ISA.62.8	Never again will foreign warriors come
ISA.62.8	and take away your grain and new wine.
ISA.62.9	You raised the grain, and you will eat it,
ISA.62.9	praising the 
ISA.62.9	Within the courtyards of the Temple,
ISA.62.9	you yourselves will drink the wine you have pressed.”
ISA.62.10	Go out through the gates!
ISA.62.10	Prepare the highway for my people to return!
ISA.62.10	Smooth out the road; pull out the boulders;
ISA.62.10	raise a flag for all the nations to see.
ISA.62.11	The 
ISA.62.11	“Tell the people of Israel,
ISA.62.11	‘Look, your Savior is coming.
ISA.62.11	See, he brings his reward with him as he comes.’”
ISA.62.12	They will be called “The Holy People”
ISA.62.12	and “The People Redeemed by the 
ISA.62.12	And Jerusalem will be known as “The Desirable Place”
ISA.62.12	and “The City No Longer Forsaken.”
ISA.63.1	Who is this who comes from Edom,
ISA.63.1	from the city of Bozrah,
ISA.63.1	with his clothing stained red?
ISA.63.1	Who is this in royal robes,
ISA.63.1	marching in his great strength?
ISA.63.1	“It is I, the 
ISA.63.1	It is I, the 
ISA.63.2	Why are your clothes so red,
ISA.63.2	as if you have been treading out grapes?
ISA.63.3	“I have been treading the winepress alone;
ISA.63.3	no one was there to help me.
ISA.63.3	In my anger I have trampled my enemies
ISA.63.3	as if they were grapes.
ISA.63.3	In my fury I have trampled my foes.
ISA.63.3	Their blood has stained my clothes.
ISA.63.4	For the time has come for me to avenge my people,
ISA.63.4	to ransom them from their oppressors.
ISA.63.5	I was amazed to see that no one intervened
ISA.63.5	to help the oppressed.
ISA.63.5	So I myself stepped in to save them with my strong arm,
ISA.63.5	and my wrath sustained me.
ISA.63.6	I crushed the nations in my anger
ISA.63.6	and made them stagger and fall to the ground,
ISA.63.6	spilling their blood upon the earth.”
ISA.63.7	I will tell of the 
ISA.63.7	I will praise the 
ISA.63.7	I will rejoice in his great goodness to Israel,
ISA.63.7	which he has granted according to his mercy and love.
ISA.63.8	He said, “They are my very own people.
ISA.63.8	Surely they will not betray me again.”
ISA.63.8	And he became their Savior.
ISA.63.9	In all their suffering he also suffered,
ISA.63.9	and he personally
ISA.63.9	In his love and mercy he redeemed them.
ISA.63.9	He lifted them up and carried them
ISA.63.9	through all the years.
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled against him
ISA.63.10	and grieved his Holy Spirit.
ISA.63.10	So he became their enemy
ISA.63.10	and fought against them.
ISA.63.11	Then they remembered those days of old
ISA.63.11	when Moses led his people out of Egypt.
ISA.63.11	They cried out, “Where is the one who brought Israel through the sea,
ISA.63.11	with Moses as their shepherd?
ISA.63.11	Where is the one who sent his Holy Spirit
ISA.63.11	to be among his people?
ISA.63.12	Where is the one whose power was displayed
ISA.63.12	when Moses lifted up his hand—
ISA.63.12	the one who divided the sea before them,
ISA.63.12	making himself famous forever?
ISA.63.13	Where is the one who led them through the bottom of the sea?
ISA.63.13	They were like fine stallions
ISA.63.13	racing through the desert, never stumbling.
ISA.63.14	As with cattle going down into a peaceful valley,
ISA.63.14	the Spirit of the 
ISA.63.14	You led your people, 
ISA.63.14	and gained a magnificent reputation.”
ISA.63.15	, look down from heaven;
ISA.63.15	look from your holy, glorious home, and see us.
ISA.63.15	Where is the passion and the might
ISA.63.15	you used to show on our behalf?
ISA.63.15	Where are your mercy and compassion now?
ISA.63.16	Surely you are still our Father!
ISA.63.16	Even if Abraham and Jacob
ISA.63.16	, you would still be our Father.
ISA.63.16	You are our Redeemer from ages past.
ISA.63.17	, why have you allowed us to turn from your path?
ISA.63.17	Why have you given us stubborn hearts so we no longer fear you?
ISA.63.17	Return and help us, for we are your servants,
ISA.63.17	the tribes that are your special possession.
ISA.63.18	How briefly your holy people possessed your holy place,
ISA.63.18	and now our enemies have destroyed it.
ISA.63.19	Sometimes it seems as though we never belonged to you,
ISA.63.19	as though we had never been known as your people.
ISA.64.1	Oh, that you would burst from the heavens and come down!
ISA.64.1	How the mountains would quake in your presence!
ISA.64.2	As fire causes wood to burn
ISA.64.2	and water to boil,
ISA.64.2	your coming would make the nations tremble.
ISA.64.2	Then your enemies would learn the reason for your fame!
ISA.64.3	When you came down long ago,
ISA.64.3	you did awesome deeds beyond our highest expectations.
ISA.64.3	And oh, how the mountains quaked!
ISA.64.4	For since the world began,
ISA.64.4	no ear has heard
ISA.64.4	and no eye has seen a God like you,
ISA.64.4	who works for those who wait for him!
ISA.64.5	You welcome those who gladly do good,
ISA.64.5	who follow godly ways.
ISA.64.5	But you have been very angry with us,
ISA.64.5	for we are not godly.
ISA.64.5	We are constant sinners;
ISA.64.5	how can people like us be saved?
ISA.64.6	We are all infected and impure with sin.
ISA.64.6	When we display our righteous deeds,
ISA.64.6	they are nothing but filthy rags.
ISA.64.6	Like autumn leaves, we wither and fall,
ISA.64.6	and our sins sweep us away like the wind.
ISA.64.7	Yet no one calls on your name
ISA.64.7	or pleads with you for mercy.
ISA.64.7	Therefore, you have turned away from us
ISA.64.7	and turned us over
ISA.64.8	And yet, O 
ISA.64.8	We are the clay, and you are the potter.
ISA.64.8	We all are formed by your hand.
ISA.64.9	Don’t be so angry with us, 
ISA.64.9	Please don’t remember our sins forever.
ISA.64.9	Look at us, we pray,
ISA.64.9	and see that we are all your people.
ISA.64.10	Your holy cities are destroyed.
ISA.64.10	Zion is a wilderness;
ISA.64.10	yes, Jerusalem is a desolate ruin.
ISA.64.11	The holy and beautiful Temple
ISA.64.11	where our ancestors praised you
ISA.64.11	has been burned down,
ISA.64.11	and all the things of beauty are destroyed.
ISA.64.12	After all this, 
ISA.64.12	Will you continue to be silent and punish us?
ISA.65.1	The 
ISA.65.1	“I was ready to respond, but no one asked for help.
ISA.65.1	I was ready to be found, but no one was looking for me.
ISA.65.1	I said, ‘Here I am, here I am!’
ISA.65.1	to a nation that did not call on my name.
ISA.65.2	All day long I opened my arms to a rebellious people.
ISA.65.2	But they follow their own evil paths
ISA.65.2	and their own crooked schemes.
ISA.65.3	All day long they insult me to my face
ISA.65.3	by worshiping idols in their sacred gardens.
ISA.65.3	They burn incense on pagan altars.
ISA.65.4	At night they go out among the graves,
ISA.65.4	worshiping the dead.
ISA.65.4	They eat the flesh of pigs
ISA.65.4	and make stews with other forbidden foods.
ISA.65.5	Yet they say to each other,
ISA.65.5	‘Don’t come too close or you will defile me!
ISA.65.5	I am holier than you!’
ISA.65.5	These people are a stench in my nostrils,
ISA.65.5	an acrid smell that never goes away.
ISA.65.6	“Look, my decree is written out
ISA.65.6	I will not stand silent;
ISA.65.6	I will repay them in full!
ISA.65.6	Yes, I will repay them—
ISA.65.7	both for their own sins
ISA.65.7	and for those of their ancestors,”
ISA.65.7	says the 
ISA.65.7	“For they also burned incense on the mountains
ISA.65.7	and insulted me on the hills.
ISA.65.7	I will pay them back in full!
ISA.65.8	“But I will not destroy them all,”
ISA.65.8	says the 
ISA.65.8	“For just as good grapes are found among a cluster of bad ones
ISA.65.8	(and someone will say, ‘Don’t throw them all away—
ISA.65.8	some of those grapes are good!’),
ISA.65.8	so I will not destroy all Israel.
ISA.65.8	For I still have true servants there.
ISA.65.9	I will preserve a remnant of the people of Israel
ISA.65.9	and of Judah to possess my land.
ISA.65.9	Those I choose will inherit it,
ISA.65.9	and my servants will live there.
ISA.65.10	The plain of Sharon will again be filled with flocks
ISA.65.10	for my people who have searched for me,
ISA.65.10	and the valley of Achor will be a place to pasture herds.
ISA.65.11	“But because the rest of you have forsaken the 
ISA.65.11	and have forgotten his Temple,
ISA.65.11	and because you have prepared feasts to honor the god of Fate
ISA.65.11	and have offered mixed wine to the god of Destiny,
ISA.65.12	now I will ‘destine’ you for the sword.
ISA.65.12	All of you will bow down before the executioner.
ISA.65.12	For when I called, you did not answer.
ISA.65.12	When I spoke, you did not listen.
ISA.65.12	You deliberately sinned—before my very eyes—
ISA.65.12	and chose to do what you know I despise.”
ISA.65.13	Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
ISA.65.13	“My servants will eat,
ISA.65.13	but you will starve.
ISA.65.13	My servants will drink,
ISA.65.13	but you will be thirsty.
ISA.65.13	My servants will rejoice,
ISA.65.13	but you will be sad and ashamed.
ISA.65.14	My servants will sing for joy,
ISA.65.14	but you will cry in sorrow and despair.
ISA.65.15	Your name will be a curse word among my people,
ISA.65.15	for the Sovereign 
ISA.65.15	and will call his true servants by another name.
ISA.65.16	All who invoke a blessing or take an oath
ISA.65.16	will do so by the God of truth.
ISA.65.16	For I will put aside my anger
ISA.65.16	and forget the evil of earlier days.
ISA.65.17	“Look! I am creating new heavens and a new earth,
ISA.65.17	and no one will even think about the old ones anymore.
ISA.65.18	Be glad; rejoice forever in my creation!
ISA.65.18	And look! I will create Jerusalem as a place of happiness.
ISA.65.18	Her people will be a source of joy.
ISA.65.19	I will rejoice over Jerusalem
ISA.65.19	and delight in my people.
ISA.65.19	And the sound of weeping and crying
ISA.65.19	will be heard in it no more.
ISA.65.20	“No longer will babies die when only a few days old.
ISA.65.20	No longer will adults die before they have lived a full life.
ISA.65.20	No longer will people be considered old at one hundred!
ISA.65.20	Only the cursed will die that young!
ISA.65.21	In those days people will live in the houses they build
ISA.65.21	and eat the fruit of their own vineyards.
ISA.65.22	Unlike the past, invaders will not take their houses
ISA.65.22	and confiscate their vineyards.
ISA.65.22	For my people will live as long as trees,
ISA.65.22	and my chosen ones will have time to enjoy their hard-won gains.
ISA.65.23	They will not work in vain,
ISA.65.23	and their children will not be doomed to misfortune.
ISA.65.23	For they are people blessed by the 
ISA.65.23	and their children, too, will be blessed.
ISA.65.24	I will answer them before they even call to me.
ISA.65.24	While they are still talking about their needs,
ISA.65.24	I will go ahead and answer their prayers!
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb will feed together.
ISA.65.25	The lion will eat hay like a cow.
ISA.65.25	But the snakes will eat dust.
ISA.65.25	In those days no one will be hurt or destroyed on my holy mountain.
ISA.65.25	I, the 
ISA.66.1	This is what the 
ISA.66.1	“Heaven is my throne,
ISA.66.1	and the earth is my footstool.
ISA.66.1	Could you build me a temple as good as that?
ISA.66.1	Could you build me such a resting place?
ISA.66.2	My hands have made both heaven and earth;
ISA.66.2	they and everything in them are mine.
ISA.66.2	I, the 
ISA.66.2	“I will bless those who have humble and contrite hearts,
ISA.66.2	who tremble at my word.
ISA.66.3	But those who choose their own ways—
ISA.66.3	delighting in their detestable sins—
ISA.66.3	will not have their offerings accepted.
ISA.66.3	When such people sacrifice a bull,
ISA.66.3	it is no more acceptable than a human sacrifice.
ISA.66.3	When they sacrifice a lamb,
ISA.66.3	it’s as though they had sacrificed a dog!
ISA.66.3	When they bring an offering of grain,
ISA.66.3	they might as well offer the blood of a pig.
ISA.66.3	When they burn frankincense,
ISA.66.3	it’s as if they had blessed an idol.
ISA.66.4	I will send them great trouble—
ISA.66.4	all the things they feared.
ISA.66.4	For when I called, they did not answer.
ISA.66.4	When I spoke, they did not listen.
ISA.66.4	They deliberately sinned before my very eyes
ISA.66.4	and chose to do what they know I despise.”
ISA.66.5	Hear this message from the 
ISA.66.5	all you who tremble at his words:
ISA.66.5	“Your own people hate you
ISA.66.5	and throw you out for being loyal to my name.
ISA.66.5	‘Let the 
ISA.66.5	‘Be joyful in him!’
ISA.66.5	But they will be put to shame.
ISA.66.6	What is all the commotion in the city?
ISA.66.6	What is that terrible noise from the Temple?
ISA.66.6	It is the voice of the 
ISA.66.6	taking vengeance against his enemies.
ISA.66.7	“Before the birth pains even begin,
ISA.66.7	Jerusalem gives birth to a son.
ISA.66.8	Who has ever seen anything as strange as this?
ISA.66.8	Who ever heard of such a thing?
ISA.66.8	Has a nation ever been born in a single day?
ISA.66.8	Has a country ever come forth in a mere moment?
ISA.66.8	But by the time Jerusalem’s
ISA.66.8	her children will be born.
ISA.66.9	Would I ever bring this nation to the point of birth
ISA.66.9	and then not deliver it?” asks the 
ISA.66.9	“No! I would never keep this nation from being born,”
ISA.66.9	says your God.
ISA.66.10	“Rejoice with Jerusalem!
ISA.66.10	Be glad with her, all you who love her
ISA.66.10	and all you who mourn for her.
ISA.66.11	Drink deeply of her glory
ISA.66.11	even as an infant drinks at its mother’s comforting breasts.”
ISA.66.12	This is what the 
ISA.66.12	“I will give Jerusalem a river of peace and prosperity.
ISA.66.12	The wealth of the nations will flow to her.
ISA.66.12	Her children will be nursed at her breasts,
ISA.66.12	carried in her arms, and held on her lap.
ISA.66.13	I will comfort you there in Jerusalem
ISA.66.13	as a mother comforts her child.”
ISA.66.14	When you see these things, your heart will rejoice.
ISA.66.14	You will flourish like the grass!
ISA.66.14	Everyone will see the 
ISA.66.14	and his anger against his enemies.
ISA.66.15	See, the 
ISA.66.15	and his swift chariots roar like a whirlwind.
ISA.66.15	He will bring punishment with the fury of his anger
ISA.66.15	and the flaming fire of his hot rebuke.
ISA.66.16	The 
ISA.66.16	and by his sword.
ISA.66.16	He will judge the earth,
ISA.66.16	and many will be killed by him.
ISA.66.17	“Those who ‘consecrate’ and ‘purify’ themselves in a sacred garden with its idol in the center—feasting on pork and rats and other detestable meats—will come to a terrible end,” says the 
ISA.66.18	“I can see what they are doing, and I know what they are thinking. So I will gather all nations and peoples together, and they will see my glory. 
ISA.66.19	I will perform a sign among them. And I will send those who survive to be messengers to the nations—to Tarshish, to the Libyans
ISA.66.20	They will bring the remnant of your people back from every nation. They will bring them to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the 
ISA.66.21	“And I will appoint some of them to be my priests and Levites. I, the 
ISA.66.22	“As surely as my new heavens and earth will remain,
ISA.66.22	so will you always be my people,
ISA.66.22	with a name that will never disappear,”
ISA.66.22	says the 
ISA.66.23	“All humanity will come to worship me
ISA.66.23	from week to week
ISA.66.23	and from month to month.
ISA.66.24	And as they go out, they will see
ISA.66.24	the dead bodies of those who have rebelled against me.
ISA.66.24	For the worms that devour them will never die,
ISA.66.24	and the fire that burns them will never go out.
ISA.66.24	All who pass by
ISA.66.24	will view them with utter horror.”
JER.1.1	These are the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests from the town of Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. 
JER.1.2	The 
JER.1.3	The 
JER.1.4	The 
JER.1.5	“I knew you before I formed you in your mother’s womb.
JER.1.5	Before you were born I set you apart
JER.1.5	and appointed you as my prophet to the nations.”
JER.1.6	“O Sovereign 
JER.1.7	The 
JER.1.8	And don’t be afraid of the people, for I will be with you and will protect you. I, the 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.9	“Look, I have put my words in your mouth!
JER.1.10	Today I appoint you to stand up
JER.1.10	against nations and kingdoms.
JER.1.10	Some you must uproot and tear down,
JER.1.10	destroy and overthrow.
JER.1.10	Others you must build up
JER.1.10	and plant.”
JER.1.11	Then the 
JER.1.11	And I replied, “I see a branch from an almond tree.”
JER.1.12	And the 
JER.1.13	Then the 
JER.1.13	And I replied, “I see a pot of boiling water, spilling from the north.”
JER.1.14	“Yes,” the 
JER.1.15	Listen! I am calling the armies of the kingdoms of the north to come to Jerusalem. I, the 
JER.1.15	“They will set their thrones
JER.1.15	at the gates of the city.
JER.1.15	They will attack its walls
JER.1.15	and all the other towns of Judah.
JER.1.16	I will pronounce judgment
JER.1.16	on my people for all their evil—
JER.1.16	for deserting me and burning incense to other gods.
JER.1.16	Yes, they worship idols made with their own hands!
JER.1.17	“Get up and prepare for action.
JER.1.17	Go out and tell them everything I tell you to say.
JER.1.17	Do not be afraid of them,
JER.1.17	or I will make you look foolish in front of them.
JER.1.18	For see, today I have made you strong
JER.1.18	like a fortified city that cannot be captured,
JER.1.18	like an iron pillar or a bronze wall.
JER.1.18	You will stand against the whole land—
JER.1.18	the kings, officials, priests, and people of Judah.
JER.1.19	They will fight you, but they will fail.
JER.1.19	For I am with you, and I will take care of you.
JER.1.19	I, the 
JER.2.1	The 
JER.2.2	“Go and shout this message to Jerusalem. This is what the 
JER.2.2	“I remember how eager you were to please me
JER.2.2	as a young bride long ago,
JER.2.2	how you loved me and followed me
JER.2.2	even through the barren wilderness.
JER.2.3	In those days Israel was holy to the 
JER.2.3	the first of his children.
JER.2.3	All who harmed his people were declared guilty,
JER.2.3	and disaster fell on them.
JER.2.3	I, the 
JER.2.4	Listen to the word of the 
JER.2.5	This is what the 
JER.2.5	“What did your ancestors find wrong with me
JER.2.5	that led them to stray so far from me?
JER.2.5	They worshiped worthless idols,
JER.2.5	only to become worthless themselves.
JER.2.6	They did not ask, ‘Where is the 
JER.2.6	who brought us safely out of Egypt
JER.2.6	and led us through the barren wilderness—
JER.2.6	a land of deserts and pits,
JER.2.6	a land of drought and death,
JER.2.6	where no one lives or even travels?’
JER.2.7	“And when I brought you into a fruitful land
JER.2.7	to enjoy its bounty and goodness,
JER.2.7	you defiled my land and
JER.2.7	corrupted the possession I had promised you.
JER.2.8	The priests did not ask,
JER.2.8	‘Where is the 
JER.2.8	Those who taught my word ignored me,
JER.2.8	the rulers turned against me,
JER.2.8	and the prophets spoke in the name of Baal,
JER.2.8	wasting their time on worthless idols.
JER.2.9	Therefore, I will bring my case against you,”
JER.2.9	says the 
JER.2.9	“I will even bring charges against your children’s children
JER.2.9	in the years to come.
JER.2.10	“Go west and look in the land of Cyprus
JER.2.10	go east and search through the land of Kedar.
JER.2.10	Has anyone ever heard of anything
JER.2.10	as strange as this?
JER.2.11	Has any nation ever traded its gods for new ones,
JER.2.11	even though they are not gods at all?
JER.2.11	Yet my people have exchanged their glorious God
JER.2.11	for worthless idols!
JER.2.12	The heavens are shocked at such a thing
JER.2.12	and shrink back in horror and dismay,”
JER.2.12	says the 
JER.2.13	“For my people have done two evil things:
JER.2.13	They have abandoned me—
JER.2.13	the fountain of living water.
JER.2.13	And they have dug for themselves cracked cisterns
JER.2.13	that can hold no water at all!
JER.2.14	“Why has Israel become a slave?
JER.2.14	Why has he been carried away as plunder?
JER.2.15	Strong lions have roared against him,
JER.2.15	and the land has been destroyed.
JER.2.15	The towns are now in ruins,
JER.2.15	and no one lives in them anymore.
JER.2.16	Egyptians, marching from their cities of Memphis
JER.2.16	have destroyed Israel’s glory and power.

JER.2.18	“What have you gained by your alliances with Egypt
JER.2.18	and your covenants with Assyria?
JER.2.18	What good to you are the streams of the Nile
JER.2.18	or the waters of the Euphrates River?
JER.2.19	Your wickedness will bring its own punishment.
JER.2.19	Your turning from me will shame you.
JER.2.19	You will see what an evil, bitter thing it is
JER.2.19	to abandon the 
JER.2.19	I, the Lord, the 
JER.2.20	“Long ago I broke the yoke that oppressed you
JER.2.20	and tore away the chains of your slavery,
JER.2.20	but still you said,
JER.2.20	‘I will not serve you.’
JER.2.20	On every hill and under every green tree,
JER.2.20	you have prostituted yourselves by bowing down to idols.
JER.2.21	But I was the one who planted you,
JER.2.21	choosing a vine of the purest stock—the very best.
JER.2.21	How did you grow into this corrupt wild vine?
JER.2.22	No amount of soap or lye can make you clean.
JER.2.22	I still see the stain of your guilt.
JER.2.22	I, the Sovereign 
JER.2.23	“You say, ‘That’s not true!
JER.2.23	I haven’t worshiped the images of Baal!’
JER.2.23	But how can you say that?
JER.2.23	Go and look in any valley in the land!
JER.2.23	Face the awful sins you have done.
JER.2.23	You are like a restless female camel
JER.2.23	desperately searching for a mate.
JER.2.24	You are like a wild donkey,
JER.2.24	sniffing the wind at mating time.
JER.2.24	Who can restrain her lust?
JER.2.24	Those who desire her don’t need to search,
JER.2.24	for she goes running to them!
JER.2.25	When will you stop running?
JER.2.25	When will you stop panting after other gods?
JER.2.25	But you say, ‘Save your breath.
JER.2.25	I’m in love with these foreign gods,
JER.2.25	and I can’t stop loving them now!’
JER.2.26	“Israel is like a thief
JER.2.26	who feels shame only when he gets caught.
JER.2.26	They, their kings, officials, priests, and prophets—
JER.2.26	all are alike in this.
JER.2.27	To an image carved from a piece of wood they say,
JER.2.27	‘You are my father.’
JER.2.27	To an idol chiseled from a block of stone they say,
JER.2.27	‘You are my mother.’
JER.2.27	They turn their backs on me,
JER.2.27	but in times of trouble they cry out to me,
JER.2.27	‘Come and save us!’
JER.2.28	But why not call on these gods you have made?
JER.2.28	When trouble comes, let them save you if they can!
JER.2.28	For you have as many gods
JER.2.28	as there are towns in Judah.
JER.2.29	Why do you accuse me of doing wrong?
JER.2.29	You are the ones who have rebelled,”
JER.2.29	says the 
JER.2.30	“I have punished your children,
JER.2.30	but they did not respond to my discipline.
JER.2.30	You yourselves have killed your prophets
JER.2.30	as a lion kills its prey.
JER.2.31	“O my people, listen to the words of the 
JER.2.31	Have I been like a desert to Israel?
JER.2.31	Have I been to them a land of darkness?
JER.2.31	Why then do my people say, ‘At last we are free from God!
JER.2.31	We don’t need him anymore!’
JER.2.32	Does a young woman forget her jewelry,
JER.2.32	or a bride her wedding dress?
JER.2.32	Yet for years on end
JER.2.32	my people have forgotten me.
JER.2.33	“How you plot and scheme to win your lovers.
JER.2.33	Even an experienced prostitute could learn from you!
JER.2.34	Your clothing is stained with the blood of the innocent and the poor,
JER.2.34	though you didn’t catch them breaking into your houses!
JER.2.35	And yet you say,
JER.2.35	‘I have done nothing wrong.
JER.2.35	Surely God isn’t angry with me!’
JER.2.35	But now I will punish you severely
JER.2.35	because you claim you have not sinned.
JER.2.36	First here, then there—
JER.2.36	you flit from one ally to another asking for help.
JER.2.36	But your new friends in Egypt will let you down,
JER.2.36	just as Assyria did before.
JER.2.37	In despair, you will be led into exile
JER.2.37	with your hands on your heads,
JER.2.37	for the 
JER.2.37	They will not help you at all.
JER.3.1	“If a man divorces a woman
JER.3.1	and she goes and marries someone else,
JER.3.1	he will not take her back again,
JER.3.1	for that would surely corrupt the land.
JER.3.1	But you have prostituted yourself with many lovers,
JER.3.1	so why are you trying to come back to me?”
JER.3.1	says the 
JER.3.2	“Look at the shrines on every hilltop.
JER.3.2	Is there any place you have not been defiled
JER.3.2	by your adultery with other gods?
JER.3.2	You sit like a prostitute beside the road waiting for a customer.
JER.3.2	You sit alone like a nomad in the desert.
JER.3.2	You have polluted the land with your prostitution
JER.3.2	and your wickedness.
JER.3.3	That’s why even the spring rains have failed.
JER.3.3	For you are a brazen prostitute and completely shameless.
JER.3.4	Yet you say to me,
JER.3.4	‘Father, you have been my guide since my youth.
JER.3.5	Surely you won’t be angry forever!
JER.3.5	Surely you can forget about it!’
JER.3.5	So you talk,
JER.3.5	but you keep on doing all the evil you can.”
JER.3.6	During the reign of King Josiah, the 
JER.3.7	I thought, ‘After she has done all this, she will return to me.’ But she did not return, and her faithless sister Judah saw this. 
JER.3.8	She saw
JER.3.9	Israel treated it all so lightly—she thought nothing of committing adultery by worshiping idols made of wood and stone. So now the land has been polluted. 
JER.3.10	But despite all this, her faithless sister Judah has never sincerely returned to me. She has only pretended to be sorry. I, the 
JER.3.11	Then the 
JER.3.12	Therefore, go and give this message to Israel.
JER.3.12	“O Israel, my faithless people,
JER.3.12	come home to me again,
JER.3.12	for I am merciful.
JER.3.12	I will not be angry with you forever.
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge your guilt.
JER.3.13	Admit that you rebelled against the 
JER.3.13	and committed adultery against him
JER.3.13	by worshiping idols under every green tree.
JER.3.13	Confess that you refused to listen to my voice.
JER.3.13	I, the 
JER.3.14	“Return home, you wayward children,”
JER.3.14	says the 
JER.3.14	“for I am your master.
JER.3.14	I will bring you back to the land of Israel
JER.3.14	one from this town and two from that family—
JER.3.14	from wherever you are scattered.
JER.3.15	And I will give you shepherds after my own heart,
JER.3.15	who will guide you with knowledge and understanding.
JER.3.16	“And when your land is once more filled with people,” says the 
JER.3.17	In that day Jerusalem will be known as ‘The Throne of the 
JER.3.18	In those days the people of Judah and Israel will return together from exile in the north. They will return to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance forever.
JER.3.19	“I thought to myself,
JER.3.19	‘I would love to treat you as my own children!’
JER.3.19	I wanted nothing more than to give you this beautiful land—
JER.3.19	the finest possession in the world.
JER.3.19	I looked forward to your calling me ‘Father,’
JER.3.19	and I wanted you never to turn from me.
JER.3.20	But you have been unfaithful to me, you people of Israel!
JER.3.20	You have been like a faithless wife who leaves her husband.
JER.3.20	I, the 
JER.3.21	Voices are heard high on the windswept mountains,
JER.3.21	the weeping and pleading of Israel’s people.
JER.3.21	For they have chosen crooked paths
JER.3.21	and have forgotten the 
JER.3.22	“My wayward children,” says the 
JER.3.22	“come back to me, and I will heal your wayward hearts.”
JER.3.22	“Yes, we’re coming,” the people reply,
JER.3.22	“for you are the 
JER.3.23	Our worship of idols on the hills
JER.3.23	and our religious orgies on the mountains
JER.3.23	are a delusion.
JER.3.23	Only in the 
JER.3.23	will Israel ever find salvation.
JER.3.24	From childhood we have watched
JER.3.24	as everything our ancestors worked for—
JER.3.24	their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters—
JER.3.24	was squandered on a delusion.
JER.3.25	Let us now lie down in shame
JER.3.25	and cover ourselves with dishonor,
JER.3.25	for we and our ancestors have sinned
JER.3.25	against the 
JER.3.25	From our childhood to this day
JER.3.25	we have never obeyed him.”
JER.4.1	“O Israel,” says the 
JER.4.1	“if you wanted to return to me, you could.
JER.4.1	You could throw away your detestable idols
JER.4.1	and stray away no more.
JER.4.2	Then when you swear by my name, saying,
JER.4.2	‘As surely as the 
JER.4.2	you could do so
JER.4.2	with truth, justice, and righteousness.
JER.4.2	Then you would be a blessing to the nations of the world,
JER.4.2	and all people would come and praise my name.”
JER.4.3	This is what the 
JER.4.3	“Plow up the hard ground of your hearts!
JER.4.3	Do not waste your good seed among thorns.
JER.4.4	O people of Judah and Jerusalem,
JER.4.4	surrender your pride and power.
JER.4.4	Change your hearts before the 
JER.4.4	or my anger will burn like an unquenchable fire
JER.4.4	because of all your sins.
JER.4.5	“Shout to Judah, and broadcast to Jerusalem!
JER.4.5	Tell them to sound the alarm throughout the land:
JER.4.5	‘Run for your lives!
JER.4.5	Flee to the fortified cities!’
JER.4.6	Raise a signal flag as a warning for Jerusalem
JER.4.6	‘Flee now! Do not delay!’
JER.4.6	For I am bringing terrible destruction upon you
JER.4.6	from the north.”
JER.4.7	A lion stalks from its den,
JER.4.7	a destroyer of nations.
JER.4.7	It has left its lair and is headed your way.
JER.4.7	It’s going to devastate your land!
JER.4.7	Your towns will lie in ruins,
JER.4.7	with no one living in them anymore.
JER.4.8	So put on clothes of mourning
JER.4.8	and weep with broken hearts,
JER.4.8	for the fierce anger of the 
JER.4.8	is still upon us.
JER.4.9	“In that day,” says the 
JER.4.9	“the king and the officials will tremble in fear.
JER.4.9	The priests will be struck with horror,
JER.4.9	and the prophets will be appalled.”
JER.4.10	Then I said, “O Sovereign 
JER.4.10	the people have been deceived by what you said,
JER.4.10	for you promised peace for Jerusalem.
JER.4.10	But the sword is held at their throats!”
JER.4.11	The time is coming when the 
JER.4.11	to the people of Jerusalem,
JER.4.11	“My dear people, a burning wind is blowing in from the desert,
JER.4.11	and it’s not a gentle breeze useful for winnowing grain.
JER.4.12	It is a roaring blast sent by me!
JER.4.12	Now I will pronounce your destruction!”
JER.4.13	Our enemy rushes down on us like storm clouds!
JER.4.13	His chariots are like whirlwinds.
JER.4.13	His horses are swifter than eagles.
JER.4.13	How terrible it will be, for we are doomed!
JER.4.14	O Jerusalem, cleanse your heart
JER.4.14	that you may be saved.
JER.4.14	How long will you harbor
JER.4.14	your evil thoughts?
JER.4.15	Your destruction has been announced
JER.4.15	from Dan and the hill country of Ephraim.
JER.4.16	“Warn the surrounding nations
JER.4.16	and announce this to Jerusalem:
JER.4.16	The enemy is coming from a distant land,
JER.4.16	raising a battle cry against the towns of Judah.
JER.4.17	They surround Jerusalem like watchmen around a field,
JER.4.17	for my people have rebelled against me,”
JER.4.17	says the 
JER.4.18	“Your own actions have brought this upon you.
JER.4.18	This punishment is bitter, piercing you to the heart!”
JER.4.19	My heart, my heart—I writhe in pain!
JER.4.19	My heart pounds within me! I cannot be still.
JER.4.19	For I have heard the blast of enemy trumpets
JER.4.19	and the roar of their battle cries.
JER.4.20	Waves of destruction roll over the land,
JER.4.20	until it lies in complete desolation.
JER.4.20	Suddenly my tents are destroyed;
JER.4.20	in a moment my shelters are crushed.
JER.4.21	How long must I see the battle flags
JER.4.21	and hear the trumpets of war?
JER.4.22	“My people are foolish
JER.4.22	and do not know me,” says the 
JER.4.22	“They are stupid children
JER.4.22	who have no understanding.
JER.4.22	They are clever enough at doing wrong,
JER.4.22	but they have no idea how to do right!”
JER.4.23	I looked at the earth, and it was empty and formless.
JER.4.23	I looked at the heavens, and there was no light.
JER.4.24	I looked at the mountains and hills,
JER.4.24	and they trembled and shook.
JER.4.25	I looked, and all the people were gone.
JER.4.25	All the birds of the sky had flown away.
JER.4.26	I looked, and the fertile fields had become a wilderness.
JER.4.26	The towns lay in ruins,
JER.4.26	crushed by the 
JER.4.27	This is what the 
JER.4.27	“The whole land will be ruined,
JER.4.27	but I will not destroy it completely.
JER.4.28	The earth will mourn
JER.4.28	and the heavens will be draped in black
JER.4.28	because of my decree against my people.
JER.4.28	I have made up my mind and will not change it.”
JER.4.29	At the noise of charioteers and archers,
JER.4.29	the people flee in terror.
JER.4.29	They hide in the bushes
JER.4.29	and run for the mountains.
JER.4.29	All the towns have been abandoned—
JER.4.29	not a person remains!
JER.4.30	What are you doing,
JER.4.30	you who have been plundered?
JER.4.30	Why do you dress up in beautiful clothing
JER.4.30	and put on gold jewelry?
JER.4.30	Why do you brighten your eyes with mascara?
JER.4.30	Your primping will do you no good!
JER.4.30	The allies who were your lovers
JER.4.30	despise you and seek to kill you.
JER.4.31	I hear a cry, like that of a woman in labor,
JER.4.31	the groans of a woman giving birth to her first child.
JER.4.31	It is beautiful Jerusalem
JER.4.31	gasping for breath and crying out,
JER.4.31	“Help! I’m being murdered!”
JER.5.1	“Run up and down every street in Jerusalem,” says the 
JER.5.1	“Look high and low; search throughout the city!
JER.5.1	If you can find even one just and honest person,
JER.5.1	I will not destroy the city.
JER.5.2	But even when they are under oath,
JER.5.2	saying, ‘As surely as the 
JER.5.2	they are still telling lies!”
JER.5.3	, you are searching for honesty.
JER.5.3	You struck your people,
JER.5.3	but they paid no attention.
JER.5.3	You crushed them,
JER.5.3	but they refused to be corrected.
JER.5.3	They are determined, with faces set like stone;
JER.5.3	they have refused to repent.
JER.5.4	Then I said, “But what can we expect from the poor?
JER.5.4	They are ignorant.
JER.5.4	They don’t know the ways of the 
JER.5.4	They don’t understand God’s laws.
JER.5.5	So I will go and speak to their leaders.
JER.5.5	Surely they know the ways of the 
JER.5.5	and understand God’s laws.”
JER.5.5	But the leaders, too, as one man,
JER.5.5	had thrown off God’s yoke
JER.5.5	and broken his chains.
JER.5.6	So now a lion from the forest will attack them;
JER.5.6	a wolf from the desert will pounce on them.
JER.5.6	A leopard will lurk near their towns,
JER.5.6	tearing apart any who dare to venture out.
JER.5.6	For their rebellion is great,
JER.5.6	and their sins are many.
JER.5.7	“How can I pardon you?
JER.5.7	For even your children have turned from me.
JER.5.7	They have sworn by gods that are not gods at all!
JER.5.7	I fed my people until they were full.
JER.5.7	But they thanked me by committing adultery
JER.5.7	and lining up at the brothels.
JER.5.8	They are well-fed, lusty stallions,
JER.5.8	each neighing for his neighbor’s wife.
JER.5.9	Should I not punish them for this?” says the 
JER.5.9	“Should I not avenge myself against such a nation?
JER.5.10	“Go down the rows of the vineyards and destroy the grapevines,
JER.5.10	leaving a scattered few alive.
JER.5.10	Strip the branches from the vines,
JER.5.10	for these people do not belong to the 
JER.5.11	The people of Israel and Judah
JER.5.11	are full of treachery against me,”
JER.5.11	says the 
JER.5.12	“They have lied about the 
JER.5.12	and said, ‘He won’t bother us!
JER.5.12	No disasters will come upon us.
JER.5.12	There will be no war or famine.
JER.5.13	God’s prophets are all windbags
JER.5.13	who don’t really speak for him.
JER.5.13	Let their predictions of disaster fall on themselves!’”
JER.5.14	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.5.14	“Because the people are talking like this,
JER.5.14	my messages will flame out of your mouth
JER.5.14	and burn the people like kindling wood.
JER.5.15	O Israel, I will bring a distant nation against you,”
JER.5.15	says the 
JER.5.15	“It is a mighty nation,
JER.5.15	an ancient nation,
JER.5.15	a people whose language you do not know,
JER.5.15	whose speech you cannot understand.
JER.5.16	Their weapons are deadly;
JER.5.16	their warriors are mighty.
JER.5.17	They will devour the food of your harvest;
JER.5.17	they will devour your sons and daughters.
JER.5.17	They will devour your flocks and herds;
JER.5.17	they will devour your grapes and figs.
JER.5.17	And they will destroy your fortified towns,
JER.5.17	which you think are so safe.
JER.5.18	“Yet even in those days I will not blot you out completely,” says the 
JER.5.19	“And when your people ask, ‘Why did the 
JER.5.20	“Make this announcement to Israel,
JER.5.20	and say this to Judah:
JER.5.21	Listen, you foolish and senseless people,
JER.5.21	with eyes that do not see
JER.5.21	and ears that do not hear.
JER.5.22	Have you no respect for me?
JER.5.22	Why don’t you tremble in my presence?
JER.5.22	I, the 
JER.5.22	as an everlasting boundary that the waters cannot cross.
JER.5.22	The waves may toss and roar,
JER.5.22	but they can never pass the boundaries I set.
JER.5.23	But my people have stubborn and rebellious hearts.
JER.5.23	They have turned away and abandoned me.
JER.5.24	They do not say from the heart,
JER.5.24	‘Let us live in awe of the 
JER.5.24	for he gives us rain each spring and fall,
JER.5.24	assuring us of a harvest when the time is right.’
JER.5.25	Your wickedness has deprived you of these wonderful blessings.
JER.5.25	Your sin has robbed you of all these good things.
JER.5.26	“Among my people are wicked men
JER.5.26	who lie in wait for victims like a hunter hiding in a blind.
JER.5.26	They continually set traps
JER.5.26	to catch people.
JER.5.27	Like a cage filled with birds,
JER.5.27	their homes are filled with evil plots.
JER.5.27	And now they are great and rich.
JER.5.28	They are fat and sleek,
JER.5.28	and there is no limit to their wicked deeds.
JER.5.28	They refuse to provide justice to orphans
JER.5.28	and deny the rights of the poor.
JER.5.29	Should I not punish them for this?” says the 
JER.5.29	“Should I not avenge myself against such a nation?
JER.5.30	A horrible and shocking thing
JER.5.30	has happened in this land—
JER.5.31	the prophets give false prophecies,
JER.5.31	and the priests rule with an iron hand.
JER.5.31	Worse yet, my people like it that way!
JER.5.31	But what will you do when the end comes?
JER.6.1	“Run for your lives, you people of Benjamin!
JER.6.1	Get out of Jerusalem!
JER.6.1	Sound the alarm in Tekoa!
JER.6.1	Send up a signal at Beth-hakkerem!
JER.6.1	A powerful army is coming from the north,
JER.6.1	coming with disaster and destruction.
JER.6.2	O Jerusalem,
JER.6.2	but I will destroy you!
JER.6.3	Enemies will surround you, like shepherds camped around the city.
JER.6.3	Each chooses a place for his troops to devour.
JER.6.4	They shout, ‘Prepare for battle!
JER.6.4	Attack at noon!’
JER.6.4	‘No, it’s too late; the day is fading,
JER.6.4	and the evening shadows are falling.’
JER.6.5	‘Well then, let’s attack at night
JER.6.5	and destroy her palaces!’”
JER.6.6	This is what the 
JER.6.6	“Cut down the trees for battering rams.
JER.6.6	Build siege ramps against the walls of Jerusalem.
JER.6.6	This is the city to be punished,
JER.6.6	for she is wicked through and through.
JER.6.7	She spouts evil like a fountain.
JER.6.7	Her streets echo with the sounds of violence and destruction.
JER.6.7	I always see her sickness and sores.
JER.6.8	Listen to this warning, Jerusalem,
JER.6.8	or I will turn from you in disgust.
JER.6.8	Listen, or I will turn you into a heap of ruins,
JER.6.8	a land where no one lives.”
JER.6.9	This is what the 
JER.6.9	“Even the few who remain in Israel
JER.6.9	will be picked over again,
JER.6.9	as when a harvester checks each vine a second time
JER.6.9	to pick the grapes that were missed.”
JER.6.10	To whom can I give warning?
JER.6.10	Who will listen when I speak?
JER.6.10	Their ears are closed,
JER.6.10	and they cannot hear.
JER.6.10	They scorn the word of the 
JER.6.10	They don’t want to listen at all.
JER.6.11	So now I am filled with the 
JER.6.11	Yes, I am tired of holding it in!
JER.6.11	“I will pour out my fury on children playing in the streets
JER.6.11	and on gatherings of young men,
JER.6.11	on husbands and wives
JER.6.11	and on those who are old and gray.
JER.6.12	Their homes will be turned over to their enemies,
JER.6.12	as will their fields and their wives.
JER.6.12	For I will raise my powerful fist
JER.6.12	against the people of this land,”
JER.6.12	says the 
JER.6.13	“From the least to the greatest,
JER.6.13	their lives are ruled by greed.
JER.6.13	From prophets to priests,
JER.6.13	they are all frauds.
JER.6.14	They offer superficial treatments
JER.6.14	for my people’s mortal wound.
JER.6.14	They give assurances of peace
JER.6.14	when there is no peace.
JER.6.15	Are they ashamed of their disgusting actions?
JER.6.15	Not at all—they don’t even know how to blush!
JER.6.15	Therefore, they will lie among the slaughtered.
JER.6.15	They will be brought down when I punish them,”
JER.6.15	says the 
JER.6.16	This is what the 
JER.6.16	“Stop at the crossroads and look around.
JER.6.16	Ask for the old, godly way, and walk in it.
JER.6.16	Travel its path, and you will find rest for your souls.
JER.6.16	But you reply, ‘No, that’s not the road we want!’
JER.6.17	I posted watchmen over you who said,
JER.6.17	‘Listen for the sound of the alarm.’
JER.6.17	But you replied,
JER.6.17	‘No! We won’t pay attention!’
JER.6.18	“Therefore, listen to this, all you nations.
JER.6.18	Take note of my people’s situation.
JER.6.19	Listen, all the earth!
JER.6.19	I will bring disaster on my people.
JER.6.19	It is the fruit of their own schemes,
JER.6.19	because they refuse to listen to me.
JER.6.19	They have rejected my word.
JER.6.20	There’s no use offering me sweet frankincense from Sheba.
JER.6.20	Keep your fragrant calamus imported from distant lands!
JER.6.20	I will not accept your burnt offerings.
JER.6.20	Your sacrifices have no pleasing aroma for me.”
JER.6.21	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.6.21	“I will put obstacles in my people’s path.
JER.6.21	Fathers and sons will both fall over them.
JER.6.21	Neighbors and friends will die together.”
JER.6.22	This is what the 
JER.6.22	“Look! A great army coming from the north!
JER.6.22	A great nation is rising against you from far-off lands.
JER.6.23	They are armed with bows and spears.
JER.6.23	They are cruel and show no mercy.
JER.6.23	They sound like a roaring sea
JER.6.23	as they ride forward on horses.
JER.6.23	They are coming in battle formation,
JER.6.23	planning to destroy you, beautiful Jerusalem.
JER.6.24	We have heard reports about the enemy,
JER.6.24	and we wring our hands in fright.
JER.6.24	Pangs of anguish have gripped us,
JER.6.24	like those of a woman in labor.
JER.6.25	Don’t go out to the fields!
JER.6.25	Don’t travel on the roads!
JER.6.25	The enemy’s sword is everywhere
JER.6.25	and terrorizes us at every turn!
JER.6.26	Oh, my people, dress yourselves in burlap
JER.6.26	and sit among the ashes.
JER.6.26	Mourn and weep bitterly, as for the loss of an only son.
JER.6.26	For suddenly the destroying armies will be upon you!
JER.6.27	“Jeremiah, I have made you a tester of metals,
JER.6.27	that you may determine the quality of my people.
JER.6.28	They are the worst kind of rebel,
JER.6.28	full of slander.
JER.6.28	They are as hard as bronze and iron,
JER.6.28	and they lead others into corruption.
JER.6.29	The bellows fiercely fan the flames
JER.6.29	to burn out the corruption.
JER.6.29	But it does not purify them,
JER.6.29	for the wickedness remains.
JER.6.30	I will label them ‘Rejected Silver,’
JER.6.30	for I, the 
JER.7.1	The 
JER.7.2	“Go to the entrance of the 
JER.7.3	This is what the 
JER.7.3	“‘Even now, if you quit your evil ways, I will let you stay in your own land. 
JER.7.4	But don’t be fooled by those who promise you safety simply because the 
JER.7.5	But I will be merciful only if you stop your evil thoughts and deeds and start treating each other with justice; 
JER.7.6	only if you stop exploiting foreigners, orphans, and widows; only if you stop your murdering; and only if you stop harming yourselves by worshiping idols. 
JER.7.7	Then I will let you stay in this land that I gave to your ancestors to keep forever.
JER.7.8	“‘Don’t be fooled into thinking that you will never suffer because the Temple is here. It’s a lie! 
JER.7.9	Do you really think you can steal, murder, commit adultery, lie, and burn incense to Baal and all those other new gods of yours, 
JER.7.10	and then come here and stand before me in my Temple and chant, “We are safe!”—only to go right back to all those evils again? 
JER.7.11	Don’t you yourselves admit that this Temple, which bears my name, has become a den of thieves? Surely I see all the evil going on there. I, the 
JER.7.12	“‘Go now to the place at Shiloh where I once put the Tabernacle that bore my name. See what I did there because of all the wickedness of my people, the Israelites. 
JER.7.13	While you were doing these wicked things, says the 
JER.7.14	So just as I destroyed Shiloh, I will now destroy this Temple that bears my name, this Temple that you trust in for help, this place that I gave to you and your ancestors. 
JER.7.15	And I will send you out of my sight into exile, just as I did your relatives, the people of Israel.
JER.7.16	“Pray no more for these people, Jeremiah. Do not weep or pray for them, and don’t beg me to help them, for I will not listen to you. 
JER.7.17	Don’t you see what they are doing throughout the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	No wonder I am so angry! Watch how the children gather wood and the fathers build sacrificial fires. See how the women knead dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. And they pour out liquid offerings to their other idol gods! 
JER.7.19	Am I the one they are hurting?” asks the 
JER.7.20	So this is what the Sovereign 
JER.7.21	This is what the 
JER.7.22	When I led your ancestors out of Egypt, it was not burnt offerings and sacrifices I wanted from them. 
JER.7.23	This is what I told them: ‘Obey me, and I will be your God, and you will be my people. Do everything as I say, and all will be well!’
JER.7.24	“But my people would not listen to me. They kept doing whatever they wanted, following the stubborn desires of their evil hearts. They went backward instead of forward. 
JER.7.25	From the day your ancestors left Egypt until now, I have continued to send my servants, the prophets—day in and day out. 
JER.7.26	But my people have not listened to me or even tried to hear. They have been stubborn and sinful—even worse than their ancestors.
JER.7.27	“Tell them all this, but do not expect them to listen. Shout out your warnings, but do not expect them to respond. 
JER.7.28	Say to them, ‘This is the nation whose people will not obey the 
JER.7.29	Shave your head in mourning, and weep alone on the mountains. For the 
JER.7.30	“The people of Judah have sinned before my very eyes,” says the 
JER.7.31	They have built pagan shrines at Topheth, the garbage dump in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and there they burn their sons and daughters in the fire. I have never commanded such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing! 
JER.7.32	So beware, for the time is coming,” says the 
JER.7.33	The bodies of my people will be food for the vultures and wild animals, and no one will be left to scare them away. 
JER.7.34	I will put an end to the happy singing and laughter in the streets of Jerusalem. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard in the towns of Judah. The land will lie in complete desolation.
JER.8.1	“In that day,” says the 
JER.8.2	They will spread out their bones on the ground before the sun, moon, and stars—the gods my people have loved, served, and worshiped. Their bones will not be gathered up again or buried but will be scattered on the ground like manure. 
JER.8.3	And the people of this evil nation who survive will wish to die rather than live where I will send them. I, the 
JER.8.4	“Jeremiah, say to the people, ‘This is what the 
JER.8.4	“‘When people fall down, don’t they get up again?
JER.8.4	When they discover they’re on the wrong road, don’t they turn back?
JER.8.5	Then why do these people stay on their self-destructive path?
JER.8.5	Why do the people of Jerusalem refuse to turn back?
JER.8.5	They cling tightly to their lies
JER.8.5	and will not turn around.
JER.8.6	I listen to their conversations
JER.8.6	and don’t hear a word of truth.
JER.8.6	Is anyone sorry for doing wrong?
JER.8.6	Does anyone say, “What a terrible thing I have done”?
JER.8.6	No! All are running down the path of sin
JER.8.6	as swiftly as a horse galloping into battle!
JER.8.7	Even the stork that flies across the sky
JER.8.7	knows the time of her migration,
JER.8.7	as do the turtledove, the swallow, and the crane.
JER.8.7	They all return at the proper time each year.
JER.8.7	But not my people!
JER.8.7	They do not know the 
JER.8.8	“‘How can you say, “We are wise because we have the word of the 
JER.8.8	when your teachers have twisted it by writing lies?
JER.8.9	These wise teachers will fall
JER.8.9	into the trap of their own foolishness,
JER.8.9	for they have rejected the word of the 
JER.8.9	Are they so wise after all?
JER.8.10	I will give their wives to others
JER.8.10	and their farms to strangers.
JER.8.10	From the least to the greatest,
JER.8.10	their lives are ruled by greed.
JER.8.10	Yes, even my prophets and priests are like that.
JER.8.10	They are all frauds.
JER.8.11	They offer superficial treatments
JER.8.11	for my people’s mortal wound.
JER.8.11	They give assurances of peace
JER.8.11	when there is no peace.
JER.8.12	Are they ashamed of these disgusting actions?
JER.8.12	Not at all—they don’t even know how to blush!
JER.8.12	Therefore, they will lie among the slaughtered.
JER.8.12	They will be brought down when I punish them,
JER.8.12	says the 
JER.8.13	I will surely consume them.
JER.8.13	There will be no more harvests of figs and grapes.
JER.8.13	Their fruit trees will all die.
JER.8.13	Whatever I gave them will soon be gone.
JER.8.13	I, the 
JER.8.14	“Then the people will say,
JER.8.14	‘Why should we wait here to die?
JER.8.14	Come, let’s go to the fortified towns and die there.
JER.8.14	For the 
JER.8.14	and has given us a cup of poison to drink
JER.8.14	because we sinned against the 
JER.8.15	We hoped for peace, but no peace came.
JER.8.15	We hoped for a time of healing, but found only terror.’
JER.8.16	“The snorting of the enemies’ warhorses can be heard
JER.8.16	all the way from the land of Dan in the north!
JER.8.16	The neighing of their stallions makes the whole land tremble.
JER.8.16	They are coming to devour the land and everything in it—
JER.8.16	cities and people alike.
JER.8.17	I will send these enemy troops among you
JER.8.17	like poisonous snakes you cannot charm.
JER.8.17	They will bite you, and you will die.
JER.8.17	I, the 
JER.8.18	My grief is beyond healing;
JER.8.18	my heart is broken.
JER.8.19	Listen to the weeping of my people;
JER.8.19	it can be heard all across the land.
JER.8.19	“Has the 
JER.8.19	“Is her King no longer there?”
JER.8.19	“Oh, why have they provoked my anger with their carved idols
JER.8.19	and their worthless foreign gods?” says the 
JER.8.20	“The harvest is finished,
JER.8.20	and the summer is gone,” the people cry,
JER.8.20	“yet we are not saved!”
JER.8.21	I hurt with the hurt of my people.
JER.8.21	I mourn and am overcome with grief.
JER.8.22	Is there no medicine in Gilead?
JER.8.22	Is there no physician there?
JER.8.22	Why is there no healing
JER.8.22	for the wounds of my people?
JER.9.1	If only my head were a pool of water
JER.9.1	and my eyes a fountain of tears,
JER.9.1	I would weep day and night
JER.9.1	for all my people who have been slaughtered.
JER.9.2	Oh, that I could go away and forget my people
JER.9.2	and live in a travelers’ shack in the desert.
JER.9.2	For they are all adulterers—
JER.9.2	a pack of treacherous liars.
JER.9.3	“My people bend their tongues like bows
JER.9.3	to shoot out lies.
JER.9.3	They refuse to stand up for the truth.
JER.9.3	They only go from bad to worse.
JER.9.3	They do not know me,”
JER.9.3	says the 
JER.9.4	“Beware of your neighbor!
JER.9.4	Don’t even trust your brother!
JER.9.4	For brother takes advantage of brother,
JER.9.4	and friend slanders friend.
JER.9.5	They all fool and defraud each other;
JER.9.5	no one tells the truth.
JER.9.5	With practiced tongues they tell lies;
JER.9.5	they wear themselves out with all their sinning.
JER.9.6	They pile lie upon lie
JER.9.6	and utterly refuse to acknowledge me,”
JER.9.6	says the 
JER.9.7	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.9.7	“See, I will melt them down in a crucible
JER.9.7	and test them like metal.
JER.9.7	What else can I do with my people?
JER.9.8	For their tongues shoot lies like poisoned arrows.
JER.9.8	They speak friendly words to their neighbors
JER.9.8	while scheming in their heart to kill them.
JER.9.9	Should I not punish them for this?” says the 
JER.9.9	“Should I not avenge myself against such a nation?”
JER.9.10	I will weep for the mountains
JER.9.10	and wail for the wilderness pastures.
JER.9.10	For they are desolate and empty of life;
JER.9.10	the lowing of cattle is heard no more;
JER.9.10	the birds and wild animals have all fled.
JER.9.11	“I will make Jerusalem into a heap of ruins,” says the 
JER.9.11	“It will be a place haunted by jackals.
JER.9.11	The towns of Judah will be ghost towns,
JER.9.11	with no one living in them.”
JER.9.12	Who is wise enough to understand all this? Who has been instructed by the 
JER.9.13	The 
JER.9.14	Instead, they have stubbornly followed their own desires and worshiped the images of Baal, as their ancestors taught them. 
JER.9.15	So now, this is what the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them around the world, in places they and their ancestors never heard of, and even there I will chase them with the sword until I have destroyed them completely.”
JER.9.17	This is what the 
JER.9.17	“Consider all this, and call for the mourners.
JER.9.17	Send for the women who mourn at funerals.
JER.9.18	Quick! Begin your weeping!
JER.9.18	Let the tears flow from your eyes.
JER.9.19	Hear the people of Jerusalem
JER.9.19	‘We are ruined! We are completely humiliated!
JER.9.19	We must leave our land,
JER.9.19	because our homes have been torn down.’”
JER.9.20	Listen, you women, to the words of the 
JER.9.20	open your ears to what he has to say.
JER.9.20	Teach your daughters to wail;
JER.9.20	teach one another how to lament.
JER.9.21	For death has crept in through our windows
JER.9.21	and has entered our mansions.
JER.9.21	It has killed off the flower of our youth:
JER.9.21	Children no longer play in the streets,
JER.9.21	and young men no longer gather in the squares.
JER.9.22	This is what the 
JER.9.22	“Bodies will be scattered across the fields like clumps of manure,
JER.9.22	like bundles of grain after the harvest.
JER.9.22	No one will be left to bury them.”
JER.9.23	This is what the 
JER.9.23	“Don’t let the wise boast in their wisdom,
JER.9.23	or the powerful boast in their power,
JER.9.23	or the rich boast in their riches.
JER.9.24	But those who wish to boast
JER.9.24	should boast in this alone:
JER.9.24	that they truly know me and understand that I am the 
JER.9.24	who demonstrates unfailing love
JER.9.24	and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth,
JER.9.24	and that I delight in these things.
JER.9.24	I, the 
JER.9.25	“A time is coming,” says the 
JER.9.26	the Egyptians, Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites, the people who live in the desert in remote places,
JER.10.1	Hear the word that the 
JER.10.2	This is what the 
JER.10.2	“Do not act like the other nations,
JER.10.2	who try to read their future in the stars.
JER.10.2	Do not be afraid of their predictions,
JER.10.2	even though other nations are terrified by them.
JER.10.3	Their ways are futile and foolish.
JER.10.3	They cut down a tree, and a craftsman carves an idol.
JER.10.4	They decorate it with gold and silver
JER.10.4	and then fasten it securely with hammer and nails
JER.10.4	so it won’t fall over.
JER.10.5	Their gods are like
JER.10.5	helpless scarecrows in a cucumber field!
JER.10.5	They cannot speak,
JER.10.5	and they need to be carried because they cannot walk.
JER.10.5	Do not be afraid of such gods,
JER.10.5	for they can neither harm you nor do you any good.”
JER.10.6	, there is no one like you!
JER.10.6	For you are great, and your name is full of power.
JER.10.7	Who would not fear you, O King of nations?
JER.10.7	That title belongs to you alone!
JER.10.7	Among all the wise people of the earth
JER.10.7	and in all the kingdoms of the world,
JER.10.7	there is no one like you.
JER.10.8	People who worship idols are stupid and foolish.
JER.10.8	The things they worship are made of wood!
JER.10.9	They bring beaten sheets of silver from Tarshish
JER.10.9	and gold from Uphaz,
JER.10.9	and they give these materials to skillful craftsmen
JER.10.9	who make their idols.
JER.10.9	Then they dress these gods in royal blue and purple robes
JER.10.9	made by expert tailors.
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.10	He is the living God and the everlasting King!
JER.10.10	The whole earth trembles at his anger.
JER.10.10	The nations cannot stand up to his wrath.
JER.10.11	Say this to those who worship other gods: “Your so-called gods, who did not make the heavens and earth, will vanish from the earth and from under the heavens.”
JER.10.12	But the 
JER.10.12	and he preserves it by his wisdom.
JER.10.12	With his own understanding
JER.10.12	he stretched out the heavens.
JER.10.13	When he speaks in the thunder,
JER.10.13	the heavens roar with rain.
JER.10.13	He causes the clouds to rise over the earth.
JER.10.13	He sends the lightning with the rain
JER.10.13	and releases the wind from his storehouses.
JER.10.14	The whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge!
JER.10.14	The craftsmen are disgraced by the idols they make,
JER.10.14	for their carefully shaped works are a fraud.
JER.10.14	These idols have no breath or power.
JER.10.15	Idols are worthless; they are ridiculous lies!
JER.10.15	On the day of reckoning they will all be destroyed.
JER.10.16	But the God of Israel
JER.10.16	He is the Creator of everything that exists,
JER.10.16	including Israel, his own special possession.
JER.10.16	The 
JER.10.17	Pack your bags and prepare to leave;
JER.10.17	the siege is about to begin.
JER.10.18	For this is what the 
JER.10.18	“Suddenly, I will fling out
JER.10.18	all you who live in this land.
JER.10.18	I will pour great troubles upon you,
JER.10.18	and at last you will feel my anger.”
JER.10.19	My wound is severe,
JER.10.19	and my grief is great.
JER.10.19	My sickness is incurable,
JER.10.19	but I must bear it.
JER.10.20	My home is gone,
JER.10.20	and no one is left to help me rebuild it.
JER.10.20	My children have been taken away,
JER.10.20	and I will never see them again.
JER.10.21	The shepherds of my people have lost their senses.
JER.10.21	They no longer seek wisdom from the 
JER.10.21	Therefore, they fail completely,
JER.10.21	and their flocks are scattered.
JER.10.22	Listen! Hear the terrifying roar of great armies
JER.10.22	as they roll down from the north.
JER.10.22	The towns of Judah will be destroyed
JER.10.22	and become a haunt for jackals.
JER.10.23	I know, 
JER.10.23	We are not able to plan our own course.
JER.10.24	So correct me, 
JER.10.24	Do not correct me in anger, for I would die.
JER.10.25	Pour out your wrath on the nations that refuse to acknowledge you—
JER.10.25	on the peoples that do not call upon your name.
JER.10.25	For they have devoured your people Israel
JER.10.25	they have devoured and consumed them,
JER.10.25	making the land a desolate wilderness.
JER.11.1	The 
JER.11.2	“Remind the people of Judah and Jerusalem about the terms of my covenant with them. 
JER.11.3	Say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.11.4	For I said to your ancestors when I brought them out of the iron-smelting furnace of Egypt, “If you obey me and do whatever I command you, then you will be my people, and I will be your God.” 
JER.11.5	I said this so I could keep my promise to your ancestors to give you a land flowing with milk and honey—the land you live in today.’”
JER.11.5	Then I replied, “Amen, 
JER.11.6	Then the 
JER.11.7	For I solemnly warned your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, “Obey me!” I have repeated this warning over and over to this day, 
JER.11.8	but your ancestors did not listen or even pay attention. Instead, they stubbornly followed their own evil desires. And because they refused to obey, I brought upon them all the curses described in this covenant.’”
JER.11.9	Again the 
JER.11.10	They have returned to the sins of their ancestors. They have refused to listen to me and are worshiping other gods. Israel and Judah have both broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. 
JER.11.11	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.11.12	Then the people of Judah and Jerusalem will pray to their idols and burn incense before them. But the idols will not save them when disaster strikes! 
JER.11.13	Look now, people of Judah; you have as many gods as you have towns. You have as many altars of shame—altars for burning incense to your god Baal—as there are streets in Jerusalem.
JER.11.14	“Pray no more for these people, Jeremiah. Do not weep or pray for them, for I will not listen to them when they cry out to me in distress.
JER.11.15	“What right do my beloved people have to come to my Temple,
JER.11.15	when they have done so many immoral things?
JER.11.15	Can their vows and sacrifices prevent their destruction?
JER.11.15	They actually rejoice in doing evil!
JER.11.16	I, the 
JER.11.16	beautiful to see and full of good fruit.
JER.11.16	But now I have sent the fury of their enemies
JER.11.16	to burn them with fire,
JER.11.16	leaving them charred and broken.
JER.11.17	“I, the 
JER.11.18	Then the 
JER.11.19	I was like a lamb being led to the slaughter. I had no idea that they were planning to kill me! “Let’s destroy this man and all his words,” they said. “Let’s cut him down, so his name will be forgotten forever.”
JER.11.20	O 
JER.11.20	you make righteous judgments,
JER.11.20	and you examine the deepest thoughts and secrets.
JER.11.20	Let me see your vengeance against them,
JER.11.20	for I have committed my cause to you.
JER.11.21	This is what the 
JER.11.22	So this is what the 
JER.11.23	Not one of these plotters from Anathoth will survive, for I will bring disaster upon them when their time of punishment comes.”
JER.12.1	, you always give me justice
JER.12.1	when I bring a case before you.
JER.12.1	So let me bring you this complaint:
JER.12.1	Why are the wicked so prosperous?
JER.12.1	Why are evil people so happy?
JER.12.2	You have planted them,
JER.12.2	and they have taken root and prospered.
JER.12.2	Your name is on their lips,
JER.12.2	but you are far from their hearts.
JER.12.3	But as for me, 
JER.12.3	You see me and test my thoughts.
JER.12.3	Drag these people away like sheep to be butchered!
JER.12.3	Set them aside to be slaughtered!
JER.12.4	How long must this land mourn?
JER.12.4	Even the grass in the fields has withered.
JER.12.4	The wild animals and birds have disappeared
JER.12.4	because of the evil in the land.
JER.12.4	For the people have said,
JER.12.4	“The 
JER.12.5	“If racing against mere men makes you tired,
JER.12.5	how will you race against horses?
JER.12.5	If you stumble and fall on open ground,
JER.12.5	what will you do in the thickets near the Jordan?
JER.12.6	Even your brothers, members of your own family,
JER.12.6	have turned against you.
JER.12.6	They plot and raise complaints against you.
JER.12.6	Do not trust them,
JER.12.6	no matter how pleasantly they speak.
JER.12.7	“I have abandoned my people, my special possession.
JER.12.7	I have surrendered my dearest ones to their enemies.
JER.12.8	My chosen people have roared at me like a lion of the forest,
JER.12.8	so I have treated them with contempt.
JER.12.9	My chosen people act like speckled vultures,
JER.12.9	but they themselves are surrounded by vultures.
JER.12.9	Bring on the wild animals to pick their corpses clean!
JER.12.10	“Many rulers have ravaged my vineyard,
JER.12.10	trampling down the vines
JER.12.10	and turning all its beauty into a barren wilderness.
JER.12.11	They have made it an empty wasteland;
JER.12.11	I hear its mournful cry.
JER.12.11	The whole land is desolate,
JER.12.11	and no one even cares.
JER.12.12	On all the bare hilltops,
JER.12.12	destroying armies can be seen.
JER.12.12	The sword of the 
JER.12.12	from one end of the nation to the other.
JER.12.12	No one will escape!
JER.12.13	My people have planted wheat
JER.12.13	but are harvesting thorns.
JER.12.13	They have worn themselves out,
JER.12.13	but it has done them no good.
JER.12.13	They will harvest a crop of shame
JER.12.13	because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.12.14	Now this is what the 
JER.12.15	But afterward I will return and have compassion on all of them. I will bring them home to their own lands again, each nation to its own possession. 
JER.12.16	And if these nations truly learn the ways of my people, and if they learn to swear by my name, saying, ‘As surely as the 
JER.12.17	But any nation who refuses to obey me will be uprooted and destroyed. I, the 
JER.13.1	This is what the 
JER.13.2	So I bought the loincloth as the 
JER.13.3	Then the 
JER.13.4	“Take the linen loincloth you are wearing, and go to the Euphrates River.
JER.13.5	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the 
JER.13.6	A long time afterward the 
JER.13.7	So I went to the Euphrates and dug it out of the hole where I had hidden it. But now it was rotting and falling apart. The loincloth was good for nothing.
JER.13.8	Then I received this message from the 
JER.13.9	“This is what the 
JER.13.10	These wicked people refuse to listen to me. They stubbornly follow their own desires and worship other gods. Therefore, they will become like this loincloth—good for nothing! 
JER.13.11	As a loincloth clings to a man’s waist, so I created Judah and Israel to cling to me, says the 
JER.13.12	“So tell them, ‘This is what the 
JER.13.13	“Then tell them, ‘No, this is what the 
JER.13.14	I will smash them against each other, even parents against children, says the 
JER.13.15	Listen and pay attention!
JER.13.15	Do not be arrogant, for the 
JER.13.16	Give glory to the 
JER.13.16	before it is too late.
JER.13.16	Acknowledge him before he brings darkness upon you,
JER.13.16	causing you to stumble and fall on the darkening mountains.
JER.13.16	For then, when you look for light,
JER.13.16	you will find only terrible darkness and gloom.
JER.13.17	And if you still refuse to listen,
JER.13.17	I will weep alone because of your pride.
JER.13.17	My eyes will overflow with tears,
JER.13.17	because the 
JER.13.18	Say to the king and his mother,
JER.13.18	“Come down from your thrones
JER.13.18	and sit in the dust,
JER.13.18	for your glorious crowns
JER.13.18	will soon be snatched from your heads.”
JER.13.19	The towns of the Negev will close their gates,
JER.13.19	and no one will be able to open them.
JER.13.19	The people of Judah will be taken away as captives.
JER.13.19	All will be carried into exile.
JER.13.20	Open up your eyes and see
JER.13.20	the armies marching down from the north!
JER.13.20	Where is your flock—
JER.13.20	your beautiful flock—
JER.13.20	that he gave you to care for?
JER.13.21	What will you say when the 
JER.13.21	and appoints them as your rulers?
JER.13.21	Pangs of anguish will grip you,
JER.13.21	like those of a woman in labor!
JER.13.22	You may ask yourself,
JER.13.22	“Why is all this happening to me?”
JER.13.22	It is because of your many sins!
JER.13.22	That is why you have been stripped
JER.13.22	and raped by invading armies.
JER.13.23	Can an Ethiopian
JER.13.23	Can a leopard take away its spots?
JER.13.23	Neither can you start doing good,
JER.13.23	for you have always done evil.
JER.13.24	“I will scatter you like chaff
JER.13.24	that is blown away by the desert winds.
JER.13.25	This is your allotment,
JER.13.25	the portion I have assigned to you,”
JER.13.25	says the 
JER.13.25	“for you have forgotten me,
JER.13.25	putting your trust in false gods.
JER.13.26	I myself will strip you
JER.13.26	and expose you to shame.
JER.13.27	I have seen your adultery and lust,
JER.13.27	and your disgusting idol worship out in the fields and on the hills.
JER.13.27	What sorrow awaits you, Jerusalem!
JER.13.27	How long before you are pure?”
JER.14.1	This message came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.14.2	“Judah wilts;
JER.14.2	commerce at the city gates grinds to a halt.
JER.14.2	All the people sit on the ground in mourning,
JER.14.2	and a great cry rises from Jerusalem.
JER.14.3	The nobles send servants to get water,
JER.14.3	but all the wells are dry.
JER.14.3	The servants return with empty pitchers,
JER.14.3	confused and desperate,
JER.14.3	covering their heads in grief.
JER.14.4	The ground is parched
JER.14.4	and cracked for lack of rain.
JER.14.4	The farmers are deeply troubled;
JER.14.4	they, too, cover their heads.
JER.14.5	Even the doe abandons her newborn fawn
JER.14.5	because there is no grass in the field.
JER.14.6	The wild donkeys stand on the bare hills
JER.14.6	panting like thirsty jackals.
JER.14.6	They strain their eyes looking for grass,
JER.14.6	but there is none to be found.”
JER.14.7	The people say, “Our wickedness has caught up with us, 
JER.14.7	but help us for the sake of your own reputation.
JER.14.7	We have turned away from you
JER.14.7	and sinned against you again and again.
JER.14.8	O Hope of Israel, our Savior in times of trouble,
JER.14.8	why are you like a stranger to us?
JER.14.8	Why are you like a traveler passing through the land,
JER.14.8	stopping only for the night?
JER.14.9	Are you also confused?
JER.14.9	Is our champion helpless to save us?
JER.14.9	You are right here among us, 
JER.14.9	We are known as your people.
JER.14.9	Please don’t abandon us now!”
JER.14.10	So this is what the 
JER.14.10	“You love to wander far from me
JER.14.10	and do not restrain yourselves.
JER.14.10	Therefore, I will no longer accept you as my people.
JER.14.10	Now I will remember all your wickedness
JER.14.10	and will punish you for your sins.”
JER.14.11	Then the 
JER.14.12	When they fast, I will pay no attention. When they present their burnt offerings and grain offerings to me, I will not accept them. Instead, I will devour them with war, famine, and disease.”
JER.14.13	Then I said, “O Sovereign 
JER.14.14	Then the 
JER.14.15	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.14.16	As for the people to whom they prophesy—their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and war. There will be no one left to bury them. Husbands, wives, sons, and daughters—all will be gone. For I will pour out their own wickedness on them. 
JER.14.17	Now, Jeremiah, say this to them:
JER.14.17	“Night and day my eyes overflow with tears.
JER.14.17	I cannot stop weeping,
JER.14.17	for my virgin daughter—my precious people—
JER.14.17	has been struck down
JER.14.17	and lies mortally wounded.
JER.14.18	If I go out into the fields,
JER.14.18	I see the bodies of people slaughtered by the enemy.
JER.14.18	If I walk the city streets,
JER.14.18	I see people who have died of starvation.
JER.14.18	The prophets and priests continue with their work,
JER.14.18	but they don’t know what they’re doing.”
JER.14.19	, have you completely rejected Judah?
JER.14.19	Do you really hate Jerusalem?
JER.14.19	Why have you wounded us past all hope of healing?
JER.14.19	We hoped for peace, but no peace came.
JER.14.19	We hoped for a time of healing, but found only terror.
JER.14.20	, we confess our wickedness
JER.14.20	and that of our ancestors, too.
JER.14.20	We all have sinned against you.
JER.14.21	For the sake of your reputation, 
JER.14.21	Do not disgrace your own glorious throne.
JER.14.21	Please remember us,
JER.14.21	and do not break your covenant with us.
JER.14.22	Can any of the worthless foreign gods send us rain?
JER.14.22	Does it fall from the sky by itself?
JER.14.22	No, you are the one, O 
JER.14.22	Only you can do such things.
JER.14.22	So we will wait for you to help us.
JER.15.1	Then the 
JER.15.2	And if they say to you, ‘But where can we go?’ tell them, ‘This is what the 
JER.15.2	“‘Those who are destined for death, to death;
JER.15.2	those who are destined for war, to war;
JER.15.2	those who are destined for famine, to famine;
JER.15.2	those who are destined for captivity, to captivity.’
JER.15.3	“I will send four kinds of destroyers against them,” says the 
JER.15.4	Because of the wicked things Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem, I will make my people an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
JER.15.5	“Who will feel sorry for you, Jerusalem?
JER.15.5	Who will weep for you?
JER.15.5	Who will even bother to ask how you are?
JER.15.6	You have abandoned me
JER.15.6	and turned your back on me,”
JER.15.6	says the 
JER.15.6	“Therefore, I will raise my fist to destroy you.
JER.15.6	I am tired of always giving you another chance.
JER.15.7	I will winnow you like grain at the gates of your cities
JER.15.7	and take away the children you hold dear.
JER.15.7	I will destroy my own people,
JER.15.7	because they refuse to change their evil ways.
JER.15.8	There will be more widows
JER.15.8	than the grains of sand on the seashore.
JER.15.8	At noontime I will bring a destroyer
JER.15.8	against the mothers of young men.
JER.15.8	I will cause anguish and terror
JER.15.8	to come upon them suddenly.
JER.15.9	The mother of seven grows faint and gasps for breath;
JER.15.9	her sun has gone down while it is still day.
JER.15.9	She sits childless now,
JER.15.9	disgraced and humiliated.
JER.15.9	And I will hand over those who are left
JER.15.9	to be killed by the enemy.
JER.15.9	I, the 
JER.15.10	Then I said,
JER.15.10	“What sorrow is mine, my mother.
JER.15.10	Oh, that I had died at birth!
JER.15.10	I am hated everywhere I go.
JER.15.10	I am neither a lender who threatens to foreclose
JER.15.10	nor a borrower who refuses to pay—
JER.15.10	yet they all curse me.”
JER.15.11	The 
JER.15.11	“I will take care of you, Jeremiah.
JER.15.11	Your enemies will ask you to plead on their behalf
JER.15.11	in times of trouble and distress.
JER.15.12	Can a man break a bar of iron from the north,
JER.15.12	or a bar of bronze?
JER.15.13	At no cost to them,
JER.15.13	I will hand over your wealth and treasures
JER.15.13	as plunder to your enemies,
JER.15.13	for sin runs rampant in your land.
JER.15.14	I will tell your enemies to take you
JER.15.14	as captives to a foreign land.
JER.15.14	For my anger blazes like a fire
JER.15.14	that will burn forever.
JER.15.15	Then I said,
JER.15.15	“
JER.15.15	Please step in and help me. Punish my persecutors!
JER.15.15	Please give me time; don’t let me die young.
JER.15.15	It’s for your sake that I am suffering.
JER.15.16	When I discovered your words, I devoured them.
JER.15.16	They are my joy and my heart’s delight,
JER.15.16	for I bear your name,
JER.15.16	O 
JER.15.17	I never joined the people in their merry feasts.
JER.15.17	I sat alone because your hand was on me.
JER.15.17	I was filled with indignation at their sins.
JER.15.18	Why then does my suffering continue?
JER.15.18	Why is my wound so incurable?
JER.15.18	Your help seems as uncertain as a seasonal brook,
JER.15.18	like a spring that has gone dry.”
JER.15.19	This is how the 
JER.15.19	“If you return to me, I will restore you
JER.15.19	so you can continue to serve me.
JER.15.19	If you speak good words rather than worthless ones,
JER.15.19	you will be my spokesman.
JER.15.19	You must influence them;
JER.15.19	do not let them influence you!
JER.15.20	They will fight against you like an attacking army,
JER.15.20	but I will make you as secure as a fortified wall of bronze.
JER.15.20	They will not conquer you,
JER.15.20	for I am with you to protect and rescue you.
JER.15.20	I, the 
JER.15.21	Yes, I will certainly keep you safe from these wicked men.
JER.15.21	I will rescue you from their cruel hands.”
JER.16.1	The 
JER.16.2	“Do not get married or have children in this place. 
JER.16.3	For this is what the 
JER.16.4	They will die from terrible diseases. No one will mourn for them or bury them, and they will lie scattered on the ground like manure. They will die from war and famine, and their bodies will be food for the vultures and wild animals.”
JER.16.5	This is what the 
JER.16.6	Both the great and the lowly will die in this land. No one will bury them or mourn for them. Their friends will not cut themselves in sorrow or shave their heads in sadness. 
JER.16.7	No one will offer a meal to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even at the death of a mother or father. No one will send a cup of wine to console them.
JER.16.8	“And do not go to their feasts and parties. Do not eat and drink with them at all. 
JER.16.9	For this is what the 
JER.16.10	“When you tell the people all these things, they will ask, ‘Why has the 
JER.16.11	“Then you will give them the 
JER.16.12	And you are even worse than your ancestors! You stubbornly follow your own evil desires and refuse to listen to me. 
JER.16.13	So I will throw you out of this land and send you into a foreign land where you and your ancestors have never been. There you can worship idols day and night—and I will grant you no favors!’
JER.16.14	“But the time is coming,” says the 
JER.16.15	Instead, they will say, ‘As surely as the 
JER.16.16	“But now I am sending for many fishermen who will catch them,” says the 
JER.16.17	I am watching them closely, and I see every sin. They cannot hope to hide from me. 
JER.16.18	I will double their punishment for all their sins, because they have defiled my land with lifeless images of their detestable gods and have filled my territory with their evil deeds.”
JER.16.19	, you are my strength and fortress,
JER.16.19	my refuge in the day of trouble!
JER.16.19	Nations from around the world
JER.16.19	will come to you and say,
JER.16.19	“Our ancestors left us a foolish heritage,
JER.16.19	for they worshiped worthless idols.
JER.16.20	Can people make their own gods?
JER.16.20	These are not real gods at all!”
JER.16.21	The 
JER.16.21	“Now I will show them my power;
JER.16.21	now I will show them my might.
JER.16.21	At last they will know and understand
JER.16.21	that I am the 
JER.17.1	“The sin of Judah
JER.17.1	is inscribed with an iron chisel—
JER.17.1	engraved with a diamond point on their stony hearts
JER.17.1	and on the corners of their altars.
JER.17.2	Even their children go to worship
JER.17.2	at their pagan altars and Asherah poles,
JER.17.2	beneath every green tree
JER.17.2	and on every high hill.
JER.17.3	So I will hand over my holy mountain—
JER.17.3	along with all your wealth and treasures
JER.17.3	and your pagan shrines—
JER.17.3	as plunder to your enemies,
JER.17.3	for sin runs rampant in your land.
JER.17.4	The wonderful possession I have reserved for you
JER.17.4	will slip from your hands.
JER.17.4	I will tell your enemies to take you
JER.17.4	as captives to a foreign land.
JER.17.4	For my anger blazes like a fire
JER.17.4	that will burn forever.”
JER.17.5	This is what the 
JER.17.5	“Cursed are those who put their trust in mere humans,
JER.17.5	who rely on human strength
JER.17.5	and turn their hearts away from the 
JER.17.6	They are like stunted shrubs in the desert,
JER.17.6	with no hope for the future.
JER.17.6	They will live in the barren wilderness,
JER.17.6	in an uninhabited salty land.
JER.17.7	“But blessed are those who trust in the 
JER.17.7	and have made the 
JER.17.8	They are like trees planted along a riverbank,
JER.17.8	with roots that reach deep into the water.
JER.17.8	Such trees are not bothered by the heat
JER.17.8	or worried by long months of drought.
JER.17.8	Their leaves stay green,
JER.17.8	and they never stop producing fruit.
JER.17.9	“The human heart is the most deceitful of all things,
JER.17.9	and desperately wicked.
JER.17.9	Who really knows how bad it is?
JER.17.10	But I, the 
JER.17.10	and examine secret motives.
JER.17.10	I give all people their due rewards,
JER.17.10	according to what their actions deserve.”
JER.17.11	Like a partridge that hatches eggs she has not laid,
JER.17.11	so are those who get their wealth by unjust means.
JER.17.11	At midlife they will lose their riches;
JER.17.11	in the end, they will become poor old fools.
JER.17.12	But we worship at your throne—
JER.17.12	eternal, high, and glorious!
JER.17.13	O 
JER.17.13	all who turn away from you will be disgraced.
JER.17.13	They will be buried in the dust of the earth,
JER.17.13	for they have abandoned the 
JER.17.14	O 
JER.17.14	if you save me, I will be truly saved.
JER.17.14	My praises are for you alone!
JER.17.15	People scoff at me and say,
JER.17.15	“What is this ‘message from the 
JER.17.15	Why don’t your predictions come true?”
JER.17.16	, I have not abandoned my job
JER.17.16	as a shepherd for your people.
JER.17.16	I have not urged you to send disaster.
JER.17.16	You have heard everything I’ve said.
JER.17.17	, don’t terrorize me!
JER.17.17	You alone are my hope in the day of disaster.
JER.17.18	Bring shame and dismay on all who persecute me,
JER.17.18	but don’t let me experience shame and dismay.
JER.17.18	Bring a day of terror on them.
JER.17.18	Yes, bring double destruction upon them!
JER.17.19	This is what the 
JER.17.20	Say to all the people, ‘Listen to this message from the 
JER.17.21	This is what the 
JER.17.22	Do not do your work on the Sabbath, but make it a holy day. I gave this command to your ancestors, 
JER.17.23	but they did not listen or obey. They stubbornly refused to pay attention or accept my discipline.
JER.17.24	“‘But if you obey me, says the 
JER.17.25	then kings and their officials will go in and out of these gates forever. There will always be a descendant of David sitting on the throne here in Jerusalem. Kings and their officials will always ride in and out among the people of Judah in chariots and on horses, and this city will remain forever. 
JER.17.26	And from all around Jerusalem, from the towns of Judah and Benjamin, from the western foothills
JER.17.27	“‘But if you do not listen to me and refuse to keep the Sabbath holy, and if on the Sabbath day you bring loads of merchandise through the gates of Jerusalem just as on other days, then I will set fire to these gates. The fire will spread to the palaces, and no one will be able to put out the roaring flames.’”
JER.18.1	The 
JER.18.2	“Go down to the potter’s shop, and I will speak to you there.” 
JER.18.3	So I did as he told me and found the potter working at his wheel. 
JER.18.4	But the jar he was making did not turn out as he had hoped, so he crushed it into a lump of clay again and started over.
JER.18.5	Then the 
JER.18.6	“O Israel, can I not do to you as this potter has done to his clay? As the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand. 
JER.18.7	If I announce that a certain nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed, 
JER.18.8	but then that nation renounces its evil ways, I will not destroy it as I had planned. 
JER.18.9	And if I announce that I will plant and build up a certain nation or kingdom, 
JER.18.10	but then that nation turns to evil and refuses to obey me, I will not bless it as I said I would.
JER.18.11	“Therefore, Jeremiah, go and warn all Judah and Jerusalem. Say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.18.12	But the people replied, “Don’t waste your breath. We will continue to live as we want to, stubbornly following our own evil desires.”
JER.18.13	So this is what the 
JER.18.13	“Has anyone ever heard of such a thing,
JER.18.13	even among the pagan nations?
JER.18.13	My virgin daughter Israel
JER.18.13	has done something terrible!
JER.18.14	Does the snow ever disappear from the mountaintops of Lebanon?
JER.18.14	Do the cold streams flowing from those distant mountains ever run dry?
JER.18.15	But my people are not so reliable, for they have deserted me;
JER.18.15	they burn incense to worthless idols.
JER.18.15	They have stumbled off the ancient highways
JER.18.15	and walk in muddy paths.
JER.18.16	Therefore, their land will become desolate,
JER.18.16	a monument to their stupidity.
JER.18.16	All who pass by will be astonished
JER.18.16	and will shake their heads in amazement.
JER.18.17	I will scatter my people before their enemies
JER.18.17	as the east wind scatters dust.
JER.18.17	And in all their trouble I will turn my back on them
JER.18.17	and refuse to notice their distress.”
JER.18.18	Then the people said, “Come on, let’s plot a way to stop Jeremiah. We have plenty of priests and wise men and prophets. We don’t need him to teach the word and give us advice and prophecies. Let’s spread rumors about him and ignore what he says.”
JER.18.19	, hear me and help me!
JER.18.19	Listen to what my enemies are saying.
JER.18.20	Should they repay evil for good?
JER.18.20	They have dug a pit to kill me,
JER.18.20	though I pleaded for them
JER.18.20	and tried to protect them from your anger.
JER.18.21	So let their children starve!
JER.18.21	Let them die by the sword!
JER.18.21	Let their wives become childless widows.
JER.18.21	Let their old men die in a plague,
JER.18.21	and let their young men be killed in battle!
JER.18.22	Let screaming be heard from their homes
JER.18.22	as warriors come suddenly upon them.
JER.18.22	For they have dug a pit for me
JER.18.22	and have hidden traps along my path.
JER.18.23	, you know all about their murderous plots against me.
JER.18.23	Don’t forgive their crimes and blot out their sins.
JER.18.23	Let them die before you.
JER.18.23	Deal with them in your anger.
JER.19.1	This is what the 
JER.19.2	Go out through the Gate of Broken Pots to the garbage dump in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and give them this message. 
JER.19.3	Say to them, ‘Listen to this message from the 
JER.19.4	“‘For Israel has forsaken me and turned this valley into a place of wickedness. The people burn incense to foreign gods—idols never before acknowledged by this generation, by their ancestors, or by the kings of Judah. And they have filled this place with the blood of innocent children. 
JER.19.5	They have built pagan shrines to Baal, and there they burn their sons as sacrifices to Baal. I have never commanded such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing! 
JER.19.6	So beware, for the time is coming, says the 
JER.19.7	“‘For I will upset the careful plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will allow the people to be slaughtered by invading armies, and I will leave their dead bodies as food for the vultures and wild animals. 
JER.19.8	I will reduce Jerusalem to ruins, making it a monument to their stupidity. All who pass by will be astonished and will gasp at the destruction they see there. 
JER.19.9	I will see to it that your enemies lay siege to the city until all the food is gone. Then those trapped inside will eat their own sons and daughters and friends. They will be driven to utter despair.’
JER.19.10	“As these men watch you, Jeremiah, smash the jar you brought. 
JER.19.11	Then say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.19.12	This is what I will do to this place and its people, says the 
JER.19.13	Yes, all the houses in Jerusalem, including the palace of Judah’s kings, will become like Topheth—all the houses where you burned incense on the rooftops to your star gods, and where liquid offerings were poured out to your idols.’”
JER.19.14	Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth, the garbage dump where he had delivered this message, and he stopped in front of the Temple of the 
JER.19.15	“This is what the 
JER.20.1	Now Pashhur son of Immer, the priest in charge of the Temple of the 
JER.20.2	So he arrested Jeremiah the prophet and had him whipped and put in stocks at the Benjamin Gate of the 
JER.20.3	The next day, when Pashhur finally released him, Jeremiah said, “Pashhur, the 
JER.20.4	For this is what the 
JER.20.5	And I will let your enemies plunder Jerusalem. All the famed treasures of the city—the precious jewels and gold and silver of your kings—will be carried off to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	As for you, Pashhur, you and all your household will go as captives to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you prophesied that everything would be all right.’”
JER.20.7	O 
JER.20.7	and I allowed myself to be misled.
JER.20.7	You are stronger than I am,
JER.20.7	and you overpowered me.
JER.20.7	Now I am mocked every day;
JER.20.7	everyone laughs at me.
JER.20.8	When I speak, the words burst out.
JER.20.8	“Violence and destruction!” I shout.
JER.20.8	So these messages from the 
JER.20.8	have made me a household joke.
JER.20.9	But if I say I’ll never mention the 
JER.20.9	or speak in his name,
JER.20.9	his word burns in my heart like a fire.
JER.20.9	It’s like a fire in my bones!
JER.20.9	I am worn out trying to hold it in!
JER.20.9	I can’t do it!
JER.20.10	I have heard the many rumors about me.
JER.20.10	They call me “The Man Who Lives in Terror.”
JER.20.10	They threaten, “If you say anything, we will report it.”
JER.20.10	Even my old friends are watching me,
JER.20.10	waiting for a fatal slip.
JER.20.10	“He will trap himself,” they say,
JER.20.10	“and then we will get our revenge on him.”
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.11	Before him my persecutors will stumble.
JER.20.11	They cannot defeat me.
JER.20.11	They will fail and be thoroughly humiliated.
JER.20.11	Their dishonor will never be forgotten.
JER.20.12	O 
JER.20.12	you test those who are righteous,
JER.20.12	and you examine the deepest thoughts and secrets.
JER.20.12	Let me see your vengeance against them,
JER.20.12	for I have committed my cause to you.
JER.20.13	Sing to the 
JER.20.13	Praise the 
JER.20.13	For though I was poor and needy,
JER.20.13	he rescued me from my oppressors.
JER.20.14	Yet I curse the day I was born!
JER.20.14	May no one celebrate the day of my birth.
JER.20.15	I curse the messenger who told my father,
JER.20.15	“Good news—you have a son!”
JER.20.16	Let him be destroyed like the cities of old
JER.20.16	that the 
JER.20.16	Terrify him all day long with battle shouts,
JER.20.17	because he did not kill me at birth.
JER.20.17	Oh, that I had died in my mother’s womb,
JER.20.17	that her body had been my grave!
JER.20.18	Why was I ever born?
JER.20.18	My entire life has been filled
JER.20.18	with trouble, sorrow, and shame.
JER.21.1	The 
JER.21.2	“Please speak to the 
JER.21.3	Jeremiah replied, “Go back to King Zedekiah and tell him, 
JER.21.4	‘This is what the 
JER.21.5	I myself will fight against you with a strong hand and a powerful arm, for I am very angry. You have made me furious! 
JER.21.6	I will send a terrible plague upon this city, and both people and animals will die. 
JER.21.7	And after all that, says the 
JER.21.8	“Tell all the people, ‘This is what the 
JER.21.9	Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die from war, famine, or disease, but those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians will live. Their reward will be life! 
JER.21.10	For I have decided to bring disaster and not good upon this city, says the 
JER.21.11	“Say to the royal family of Judah, ‘Listen to this message from the 
JER.21.12	This is what the 
JER.21.12	“‘Give justice each morning to the people you judge!
JER.21.12	Help those who have been robbed;
JER.21.12	rescue them from their oppressors.
JER.21.12	Otherwise, my anger will burn like an unquenchable fire
JER.21.12	because of all your sins.
JER.21.13	I will personally fight against the people in Jerusalem,
JER.21.13	that mighty fortress—
JER.21.13	the people who boast, “No one can touch us here.
JER.21.13	No one can break in here.”
JER.21.14	And I myself will punish you for your sinfulness,
JER.21.14	says the 
JER.21.14	I will light a fire in your forests
JER.21.14	that will burn up everything around you.’”
JER.22.1	This is what the 
JER.22.2	‘Listen to this message from the 
JER.22.3	This is what the 
JER.22.4	If you obey me, there will always be a descendant of David sitting on the throne here in Jerusalem. The king will ride through the palace gates in chariots and on horses, with his parade of attendants and subjects. 
JER.22.5	But if you refuse to pay attention to this warning, I swear by my own name, says the 
JER.22.6	Now this is what the 
JER.22.6	“I love you as much as fruitful Gilead
JER.22.6	and the green forests of Lebanon.
JER.22.6	But I will turn you into a desert,
JER.22.6	with no one living within your walls.
JER.22.7	I will call for wreckers,
JER.22.7	who will bring out their tools to dismantle you.
JER.22.7	They will tear out all your fine cedar beams
JER.22.7	and throw them on the fire.
JER.22.8	“People from many nations will pass by the ruins of this city and say to one another, ‘Why did the 
JER.22.9	And the answer will be, ‘Because they violated their covenant with the 
JER.22.10	Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss.
JER.22.10	Instead, weep for the captive king being led away!
JER.22.10	For he will never return to see his native land again.
JER.22.11	For this is what the 
JER.22.12	He will die in a distant land and will never again see his own country.”
JER.22.13	And the 
JER.22.13	who builds his palace with forced labor.
JER.22.13	He builds injustice into its walls,
JER.22.13	for he makes his neighbors work for nothing.
JER.22.13	He does not pay them for their labor.
JER.22.14	He says, ‘I will build a magnificent palace
JER.22.14	with huge rooms and many windows.
JER.22.14	I will panel it throughout with fragrant cedar
JER.22.14	and paint it a lovely red.’
JER.22.15	But a beautiful cedar palace does not make a great king!
JER.22.15	Your father, Josiah, also had plenty to eat and drink.
JER.22.15	But he was just and right in all his dealings.
JER.22.15	That is why God blessed him.
JER.22.16	He gave justice and help to the poor and needy,
JER.22.16	and everything went well for him.
JER.22.16	Isn’t that what it means to know me?”
JER.22.16	says the 
JER.22.17	“But you! You have eyes only for greed and dishonesty!
JER.22.17	You murder the innocent,
JER.22.17	oppress the poor, and reign ruthlessly.”
JER.22.18	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.22.18	“The people will not mourn for him, crying to one another,
JER.22.18	‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!’
JER.22.18	His subjects will not mourn for him, crying,
JER.22.18	‘Alas, our master is dead! Alas, his splendor is gone!’
JER.22.19	He will be buried like a dead donkey—
JER.22.19	dragged out of Jerusalem and dumped outside the gates!
JER.22.20	Weep for your allies in Lebanon.
JER.22.20	Shout for them in Bashan.
JER.22.20	Search for them in the regions east of the river.
JER.22.20	See, they are all destroyed.
JER.22.20	Not one is left to help you.
JER.22.21	I warned you when you were prosperous,
JER.22.21	but you replied, ‘Don’t bother me.’
JER.22.21	You have been that way since childhood—
JER.22.21	you simply will not obey me!
JER.22.22	And now the wind will blow away your allies.
JER.22.22	All your friends will be taken away as captives.
JER.22.22	Surely then you will see your wickedness and be ashamed.
JER.22.23	It may be nice to live in a beautiful palace
JER.22.23	paneled with wood from the cedars of Lebanon,
JER.22.23	but soon you will groan with pangs of anguish—
JER.22.23	anguish like that of a woman in labor.
JER.22.24	“As surely as I live,” says the 
JER.22.25	I will hand you over to those who seek to kill you, those you so desperately fear—to King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.22.26	I will expel you and your mother from this land, and you will die in a foreign country, not in your native land. 
JER.22.27	You will never again return to the land you yearn for.
JER.22.28	“Why is this man Jehoiachin like a discarded, broken jar?
JER.22.28	Why are he and his children to be exiled to a foreign land?
JER.22.29	O earth, earth, earth!
JER.22.29	Listen to this message from the 
JER.22.30	This is what the 
JER.22.30	‘Let the record show that this man Jehoiachin was childless.
JER.22.30	He is a failure,
JER.22.30	for none of his children will succeed him on the throne of David
JER.22.30	to rule over Judah.’
JER.23.1	“What sorrow awaits the leaders of my people—the shepherds of my sheep—for they have destroyed and scattered the very ones they were expected to care for,” says the 
JER.23.2	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.23.3	But I will gather together the remnant of my flock from the countries where I have driven them. I will bring them back to their own sheepfold, and they will be fruitful and increase in number. 
JER.23.4	Then I will appoint responsible shepherds who will care for them, and they will never be afraid again. Not a single one will be lost or missing. I, the 
JER.23.5	“For the time is coming,”
JER.23.5	says the 
JER.23.5	“when I will raise up a righteous descendant
JER.23.5	from King David’s line.
JER.23.5	He will be a King who rules with wisdom.
JER.23.5	He will do what is just and right throughout the land.
JER.23.6	And this will be his name:
JER.23.6	‘The 
JER.23.6	In that day Judah will be saved,
JER.23.6	and Israel will live in safety.
JER.23.7	“In that day,” says the 
JER.23.8	Instead, they will say, ‘As surely as the 
JER.23.9	My heart is broken because of the false prophets,
JER.23.9	and my bones tremble.
JER.23.9	I stagger like a drunkard,
JER.23.9	like someone overcome by wine,
JER.23.9	because of the holy words
JER.23.9	the 
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adultery,
JER.23.10	and it lies under a curse.
JER.23.10	The land itself is in mourning—
JER.23.10	its wilderness pastures are dried up.
JER.23.10	For they all do evil
JER.23.10	and abuse what power they have.
JER.23.11	“Even the priests and prophets
JER.23.11	are ungodly, wicked men.
JER.23.11	I have seen their despicable acts
JER.23.11	right here in my own Temple,”
JER.23.11	says the 
JER.23.12	“Therefore, the paths they take
JER.23.12	will become slippery.
JER.23.12	They will be chased through the dark,
JER.23.12	and there they will fall.
JER.23.12	For I will bring disaster upon them
JER.23.12	at the time fixed for their punishment.
JER.23.12	I, the 
JER.23.13	“I saw that the prophets of Samaria were terribly evil,
JER.23.13	for they prophesied in the name of Baal
JER.23.13	and led my people of Israel into sin.
JER.23.14	But now I see that the prophets of Jerusalem are even worse!
JER.23.14	They commit adultery and love dishonesty.
JER.23.14	They encourage those who are doing evil
JER.23.14	so that no one turns away from their sins.
JER.23.14	These prophets are as wicked
JER.23.14	as the people of Sodom and Gomorrah once were.”
JER.23.15	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.23.15	“I will feed them with bitterness
JER.23.15	and give them poison to drink.
JER.23.15	For it is because of Jerusalem’s prophets
JER.23.15	that wickedness has filled this land.”
JER.23.16	This is what the 
JER.23.16	“Do not listen to these prophets when they prophesy to you,
JER.23.16	filling you with futile hopes.
JER.23.16	They are making up everything they say.
JER.23.16	They do not speak for the 
JER.23.17	They keep saying to those who despise my word,
JER.23.17	‘Don’t worry! The 
JER.23.17	And to those who stubbornly follow their own desires,
JER.23.17	they say, ‘No harm will come your way!’
JER.23.18	“Have any of these prophets been in the 
JER.23.18	to hear what he is really saying?
JER.23.18	Has even one of them cared enough to listen?
JER.23.19	Look! The 
JER.23.19	a whirlwind that swirls down on the heads of the wicked.
JER.23.20	The anger of the 
JER.23.20	until it has finished all he has planned.
JER.23.20	In the days to come
JER.23.20	you will understand all this very clearly.
JER.23.21	“I have not sent these prophets,
JER.23.21	yet they run around claiming to speak for me.
JER.23.21	I have given them no message,
JER.23.21	yet they go on prophesying.
JER.23.22	If they had stood before me and listened to me,
JER.23.22	they would have spoken my words,
JER.23.22	and they would have turned my people
JER.23.22	from their evil ways and deeds.
JER.23.23	Am I a God who is only close at hand?” says the 
JER.23.23	“No, I am far away at the same time.
JER.23.24	Can anyone hide from me in a secret place?
JER.23.24	Am I not everywhere in all the heavens and earth?”
JER.23.24	says the 
JER.23.25	“I have heard these prophets say, ‘Listen to the dream I had from God last night.’ And then they proceed to tell lies in my name. 
JER.23.26	How long will this go on? If they are prophets, they are prophets of deceit, inventing everything they say. 
JER.23.27	By telling these false dreams, they are trying to get my people to forget me, just as their ancestors did by worshiping the idols of Baal.
JER.23.28	“Let these false prophets tell their dreams,
JER.23.28	but let my true messengers faithfully proclaim my every word.
JER.23.28	There is a difference between straw and grain!
JER.23.29	Does not my word burn like fire?”
JER.23.29	says the 
JER.23.29	“Is it not like a mighty hammer
JER.23.29	that smashes a rock to pieces?
JER.23.30	“Therefore,” says the 
JER.23.31	I am against these smooth-tongued prophets who say, ‘This prophecy is from the 
JER.23.32	I am against these false prophets. Their imaginary dreams are flagrant lies that lead my people into sin. I did not send or appoint them, and they have no message at all for my people. I, the 
JER.23.33	“Suppose one of the people or one of the prophets or priests asks you, ‘What prophecy has the 
JER.23.34	“If any prophet, priest, or anyone else says, ‘I have a prophecy from the 
JER.23.35	You should keep asking each other, ‘What is the 
JER.23.36	But stop using this phrase, ‘prophecy from the 
JER.23.37	“This is what you should say to the prophets: ‘What is the 
JER.23.38	But suppose they respond, ‘This is a prophecy from the 
JER.23.39	I will forget you completely.
JER.23.40	And I will make you an object of ridicule, and your name will be infamous throughout the ages.’”
JER.24.1	After King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.24.2	One basket was filled with fresh, ripe figs, while the other was filled with bad figs that were too rotten to eat.
JER.24.3	Then the 
JER.24.3	I replied, “Figs, some very good and some very bad, too rotten to eat.”
JER.24.4	Then the 
JER.24.5	“This is what the 
JER.24.6	I will watch over and care for them, and I will bring them back here again. I will build them up and not tear them down. I will plant them and not uproot them. 
JER.24.7	I will give them hearts that recognize me as the 
JER.24.8	“But the bad figs,” the 
JER.24.9	I will make them an object of horror and a symbol of evil to every nation on earth. They will be disgraced and mocked, taunted and cursed, wherever I scatter them. 
JER.24.10	And I will send war, famine, and disease until they have vanished from the land of Israel, which I gave to them and their ancestors.”
JER.25.1	This message for all the people of Judah came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.25.2	Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people in Judah and Jerusalem, 
JER.25.3	“For the past twenty-three years—from the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon,
JER.25.4	“Again and again the 
JER.25.5	Each time the message was this: ‘Turn from the evil road you are traveling and from the evil things you are doing. Only then will I let you live in this land that the 
JER.25.6	Do not provoke my anger by worshiping idols you made with your own hands. Then I will not harm you.’
JER.25.7	“But you would not listen to me,” says the 
JER.25.8	And now the 
JER.25.9	I will gather together all the armies of the north under King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whom I have appointed as my deputy. I will bring them all against this land and its people and against the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy
JER.25.10	I will take away your happy singing and laughter. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard. Your millstones will fall silent, and the lights in your homes will go out. 
JER.25.11	This entire land will become a desolate wasteland. Israel and her neighboring lands will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
JER.25.12	“Then, after the seventy years of captivity are over, I will punish the king of Babylon and his people for their sins,” says the 
JER.25.13	I will bring upon them all the terrors I have promised in this book—all the penalties announced by Jeremiah against the nations. 
JER.25.14	Many nations and great kings will enslave the Babylonians, just as they enslaved my people. I will punish them in proportion to the suffering they cause my people.”
JER.25.15	This is what the 
JER.25.16	When they drink from it, they will stagger, crazed by the warfare I will send against them.”
JER.25.17	So I took the cup of anger from the 
JER.25.18	I went to Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah, and their kings and officials drank from the cup. From that day until this, they have been a desolate ruin, an object of horror, contempt, and cursing. 
JER.25.19	I gave the cup to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials, and all his people, 
JER.25.20	along with all the foreigners living in that land. I also gave it to all the kings of the land of Uz and the kings of the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and what remains of Ashdod. 
JER.25.21	Then I gave the cup to the nations of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, 
JER.25.22	and the kings of Tyre and Sidon, and the kings of the regions across the sea. 
JER.25.23	I gave it to Dedan, Tema, and Buz, and to the people who live in distant places.
JER.25.24	I gave it to the kings of Arabia, the kings of the nomadic tribes of the desert, 
JER.25.25	and to the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media. 
JER.25.26	And I gave it to the kings of the northern countries, far and near, one after the other—all the kingdoms of the world. And finally, the king of Babylon
JER.25.27	Then the 
JER.25.28	And if they refuse to accept the cup, tell them, ‘The 
JER.25.29	I have begun to punish Jerusalem, the city that bears my name. Now should I let you go unpunished? No, you will not escape disaster. I will call for war against all the nations of the earth. I, the 
JER.25.30	“Now prophesy all these things, and say to them,
JER.25.30	“‘The 
JER.25.30	from his holy dwelling in heaven.
JER.25.30	He will shout like those who tread grapes;
JER.25.30	he will shout against everyone on earth.
JER.25.31	His cry of judgment will reach the ends of the earth,
JER.25.31	for the 
JER.25.31	He will judge all the people of the earth,
JER.25.31	slaughtering the wicked with the sword.
JER.25.31	I, the 
JER.25.32	This is what the 
JER.25.32	“Look! Disaster will fall upon nation after nation!
JER.25.32	A great whirlwind of fury is rising
JER.25.32	from the most distant corners of the earth!”
JER.25.33	In that day those the 
JER.25.34	Weep and moan, you evil shepherds!
JER.25.34	Roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock!
JER.25.34	The time of your slaughter has arrived;
JER.25.34	you will fall and shatter like a fragile vase.
JER.25.35	You will find no place to hide;
JER.25.35	there will be no way to escape.
JER.25.36	Listen to the frantic cries of the shepherds.
JER.25.36	The leaders of the flock are wailing in despair,
JER.25.36	for the 
JER.25.37	Peaceful meadows will be turned into a wasteland
JER.25.37	by the 
JER.25.38	He has left his den like a strong lion seeking its prey,
JER.25.38	and their land will be made desolate
JER.25.38	by the sword
JER.25.38	and the 
JER.26.1	This message came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.26.2	“This is what the 
JER.26.3	Perhaps they will listen and turn from their evil ways. Then I will change my mind about the disaster I am ready to pour out on them because of their sins.
JER.26.4	“Say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.26.5	and if you will not listen to my servants, the prophets—for I sent them again and again to warn you, but you would not listen to them—
JER.26.6	then I will destroy this Temple as I destroyed Shiloh, the place where the Tabernacle was located. And I will make Jerusalem an object of cursing in every nation on earth.’”
JER.26.7	The priests, the prophets, and all the people listened to Jeremiah as he spoke in front of the 
JER.26.8	But when Jeremiah had finished his message, saying everything the 
JER.26.9	“What right do you have to prophesy in the 
JER.26.10	When the officials of Judah heard what was happening, they rushed over from the palace and sat down at the New Gate of the Temple to hold court. 
JER.26.11	The priests and prophets presented their accusations to the officials and the people. “This man should die!” they said. “You have heard with your own ears what a traitor he is, for he has prophesied against this city.”
JER.26.12	Then Jeremiah spoke to the officials and the people in his own defense. “The 
JER.26.13	But if you stop your sinning and begin to obey the 
JER.26.14	As for me, I am in your hands—do with me as you think best. 
JER.26.15	But if you kill me, rest assured that you will be killing an innocent man! The responsibility for such a deed will lie on you, on this city, and on every person living in it. For it is absolutely true that the 
JER.26.16	Then the officials and the people said to the priests and prophets, “This man does not deserve the death sentence, for he has spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.26.17	Then some of the wise old men stood and spoke to all the people assembled there. 
JER.26.18	They said, “Remember when Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He told the people of Judah,
JER.26.18	‘This is what the 
JER.26.18	Mount Zion will be plowed like an open field;
JER.26.18	Jerusalem will be reduced to ruins!
JER.26.18	A thicket will grow on the heights
JER.26.18	where the Temple now stands.’
JER.26.19	But did King Hezekiah and the people kill him for saying this? No, they turned from their sins and worshiped the 
JER.26.20	At this time Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim was also prophesying for the 
JER.26.21	When King Jehoiakim and the army officers and officials heard what he was saying, the king sent someone to kill him. But Uriah heard about the plan and escaped in fear to Egypt. 
JER.26.22	Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Acbor to Egypt along with several other men to capture Uriah. 
JER.26.23	They took him prisoner and brought him back to King Jehoiakim. The king then killed Uriah with a sword and had him buried in an unmarked grave.
JER.26.24	Nevertheless, Ahikam son of Shaphan stood up for Jeremiah and persuaded the court not to turn him over to the mob to be killed.
JER.27.1	This message came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.27.2	This is what the 
JER.27.3	Then send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through their ambassadors who have come to see King Zedekiah in Jerusalem. 
JER.27.4	Give them this message for their masters: ‘This is what the 
JER.27.5	With my great strength and powerful arm I made the earth and all its people and every animal. I can give these things of mine to anyone I choose. 
JER.27.6	Now I will give your countries to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who is my servant. I have put everything, even the wild animals, under his control. 
JER.27.7	All the nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until his time is up. Then many nations and great kings will conquer and rule over Babylon. 
JER.27.8	So you must submit to Babylon’s king and serve him; put your neck under Babylon’s yoke! I will punish any nation that refuses to be his slave, says the 
JER.27.9	“‘Do not listen to your false prophets, fortune-tellers, interpreters of dreams, mediums, and sorcerers who say, “The king of Babylon will not conquer you.” 
JER.27.10	They are all liars, and their lies will lead to your being driven out of your land. I will drive you out and send you far away to die. 
JER.27.11	But the people of any nation that submits to the king of Babylon will be allowed to stay in their own country to farm the land as usual. I, the 
JER.27.12	Then I repeated this same message to King Zedekiah of Judah. “If you want to live, submit to the yoke of the king of Babylon and his people. 
JER.27.13	Why do you insist on dying—you and your people? Why should you choose war, famine, and disease, which the 
JER.27.14	Do not listen to the false prophets who keep telling you, ‘The king of Babylon will not conquer you.’ They are liars. 
JER.27.15	This is what the 
JER.27.16	Then I spoke to the priests and the people and said, “This is what the 
JER.27.17	Do not listen to them. Surrender to the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this whole city be destroyed? 
JER.27.18	If they really are prophets and speak the 
JER.27.19	“For the 
JER.27.20	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon left them here when he exiled Jehoiachin
JER.27.21	Yes, this is what the 
JER.27.22	‘They will all be carried away to Babylon and will stay there until I send for them,’ says the 
JER.28.1	One day in late summer
JER.28.2	“This is what the 
JER.28.3	Within two years I will bring back all the Temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar carried off to Babylon. 
JER.28.4	And I will bring back Jehoiachin
JER.28.5	Jeremiah responded to Hananiah as they stood in front of all the priests and people at the Temple. 
JER.28.6	He said, “Amen! May your prophecies come true! I hope the 
JER.28.7	But listen now to the solemn words I speak to you in the presence of all these people. 
JER.28.8	The ancient prophets who preceded you and me spoke against many nations, always warning of war, disaster, and disease. 
JER.28.9	So a prophet who predicts peace must show he is right. Only when his predictions come true can we know that he is really from the 
JER.28.10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off Jeremiah’s neck and broke it in pieces. 
JER.28.11	And Hananiah said again to the crowd that had gathered, “This is what the 
JER.28.12	Soon after this confrontation with Hananiah, the 
JER.28.13	“Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the 
JER.28.14	The 
JER.28.15	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The 
JER.28.16	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.28.17	Two months later
JER.29.1	Jeremiah wrote a letter from Jerusalem to the elders, priests, prophets, and all the people who had been exiled to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. 
JER.29.2	This was after King Jehoiachin,
JER.29.3	He sent the letter with Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah when they went to Babylon as King Zedekiah’s ambassadors to Nebuchadnezzar. This is what Jeremiah’s letter said:
JER.29.4	This is what the 
JER.29.5	“Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce. 
JER.29.6	Marry and have children. Then find spouses for them so that you may have many grandchildren. Multiply! Do not dwindle away! 
JER.29.7	And work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into exile. Pray to the 
JER.29.8	This is what the 
JER.29.9	because they are telling you lies in my name. I have not sent them,” says the 
JER.29.10	This is what the 
JER.29.11	For I know the plans I have for you,” says the 
JER.29.12	In those days when you pray, I will listen. 
JER.29.13	If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me. 
JER.29.14	I will be found by you,” says the 
JER.29.15	You claim that the 
JER.29.16	But this is what the 
JER.29.17	This is what the 
JER.29.18	Yes, I will pursue them with war, famine, and disease, and I will scatter them around the world. In every nation where I send them, I will make them an object of damnation, horror, contempt, and mockery. 
JER.29.19	For they refuse to listen to me, though I have spoken to them repeatedly through the prophets I sent. And you who are in exile have not listened either,” says the 
JER.29.20	Therefore, listen to this message from the 
JER.29.21	This is what the 
JER.29.22	Their terrible fate will become proverbial, so that the Judean exiles will curse someone by saying, ‘May the 
JER.29.23	For these men have done terrible things among my people. They have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives and have lied in my name, saying things I did not command. I am a witness to this. I, the 
JER.29.24	The 
JER.29.25	“This is what the 
JER.29.26	“The 
JER.29.27	So why have you done nothing to stop Jeremiah from Anathoth, who pretends to be a prophet among you? 
JER.29.28	Jeremiah sent a letter here to Babylon, predicting that our captivity will be a long one. He said, ‘Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce.’”
JER.29.29	But when Zephaniah the priest received Shemaiah’s letter, he took it to Jeremiah and read it to him. 
JER.29.30	Then the 
JER.29.31	“Send an open letter to all the exiles in Babylon. Tell them, ‘This is what the 
JER.29.32	I will punish him and his family. None of his descendants will see the good things I will do for my people, for he has incited you to rebel against me. I, the 
JER.30.1	The 
JER.30.2	“This is what the 
JER.30.3	For the time is coming when I will restore the fortunes of my people of Israel and Judah. I will bring them home to this land that I gave to their ancestors, and they will possess it again. I, the 
JER.30.4	This is the message the 
JER.30.5	This is what the 
JER.30.5	“I hear cries of fear;
JER.30.5	there is terror and no peace.
JER.30.6	Now let me ask you a question:
JER.30.6	Do men give birth to babies?
JER.30.6	Then why do they stand there, ashen-faced,
JER.30.6	hands pressed against their sides
JER.30.6	like a woman in labor?
JER.30.7	In all history there has never been such a time of terror.
JER.30.7	It will be a time of trouble for my people Israel.
JER.30.7	Yet in the end they will be saved!
JER.30.8	For in that day,”
JER.30.8	says the 
JER.30.8	“I will break the yoke from their necks
JER.30.8	and snap their chains.
JER.30.8	Foreigners will no longer be their masters.
JER.30.9	For my people will serve the 
JER.30.9	and their king descended from David—
JER.30.9	the king I will raise up for them.
JER.30.10	“So do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant;
JER.30.10	do not be dismayed, Israel,”
JER.30.10	says the 
JER.30.10	“For I will bring you home again from distant lands,
JER.30.10	and your children will return from their exile.
JER.30.10	Israel will return to a life of peace and quiet,
JER.30.10	and no one will terrorize them.
JER.30.11	For I am with you and will save you,”
JER.30.11	says the 
JER.30.11	“I will completely destroy the nations where I have scattered you,
JER.30.11	but I will not completely destroy you.
JER.30.11	I will discipline you, but with justice;
JER.30.11	I cannot let you go unpunished.”
JER.30.12	This is what the 
JER.30.12	“Your injury is incurable—
JER.30.12	a terrible wound.
JER.30.13	There is no one to help you
JER.30.13	or to bind up your injury.
JER.30.13	No medicine can heal you.
JER.30.14	All your lovers—your allies—have left you
JER.30.14	and do not care about you anymore.
JER.30.14	I have wounded you cruelly,
JER.30.14	as though I were your enemy.
JER.30.14	For your sins are many,
JER.30.14	and your guilt is great.
JER.30.15	Why do you protest your punishment—
JER.30.15	this wound that has no cure?
JER.30.15	I have had to punish you
JER.30.15	because your sins are many
JER.30.15	and your guilt is great.
JER.30.16	“But all who devour you will be devoured,
JER.30.16	and all your enemies will be sent into exile.
JER.30.16	All who plunder you will be plundered,
JER.30.16	and all who attack you will be attacked.
JER.30.17	I will give you back your health
JER.30.17	and heal your wounds,” says the 
JER.30.17	“For you are called an outcast—
JER.30.17	‘Jerusalem
JER.30.18	This is what the 
JER.30.18	“When I bring Israel home again from captivity
JER.30.18	and restore their fortunes,
JER.30.18	Jerusalem will be rebuilt on its ruins,
JER.30.18	and the palace reconstructed as before.
JER.30.19	There will be joy and songs of thanksgiving,
JER.30.19	and I will multiply my people, not diminish them;
JER.30.19	I will honor them, not despise them.
JER.30.20	Their children will prosper as they did long ago.
JER.30.20	I will establish them as a nation before me,
JER.30.20	and I will punish anyone who hurts them.
JER.30.21	They will have their own ruler again,
JER.30.21	and he will come from their own people.
JER.30.21	I will invite him to approach me,” says the 
JER.30.21	“for who would dare to come unless invited?
JER.30.22	You will be my people,
JER.30.22	and I will be your God.”
JER.30.23	Look! The 
JER.30.23	a driving wind that swirls down on the heads of the wicked.
JER.30.24	The fierce anger of the 
JER.30.24	until it has finished all he has planned.
JER.30.24	In the days to come
JER.30.24	you will understand all this.
JER.31.1	“In that day,” says the 
JER.31.2	This is what the 
JER.31.2	“Those who survive the coming destruction
JER.31.2	will find blessings even in the barren land,
JER.31.2	for I will give rest to the people of Israel.”
JER.31.3	Long ago the 
JER.31.3	“I have loved you, my people, with an everlasting love.
JER.31.3	With unfailing love I have drawn you to myself.
JER.31.4	I will rebuild you, my virgin Israel.
JER.31.4	You will again be happy
JER.31.4	and dance merrily with your tambourines.
JER.31.5	Again you will plant your vineyards on the mountains of Samaria
JER.31.5	and eat from your own gardens there.
JER.31.6	The day will come when watchmen will shout
JER.31.6	from the hill country of Ephraim,
JER.31.6	‘Come, let us go up to Jerusalem
JER.31.6	to worship the 
JER.31.7	Now this is what the 
JER.31.7	“Sing with joy for Israel.
JER.31.7	Shout for the greatest of nations!
JER.31.7	Shout out with praise and joy:
JER.31.7	‘Save your people, O 
JER.31.7	the remnant of Israel!’
JER.31.8	For I will bring them from the north
JER.31.8	and from the distant corners of the earth.
JER.31.8	I will not forget the blind and lame,
JER.31.8	the expectant mothers and women in labor.
JER.31.8	A great company will return!
JER.31.9	Tears of joy will stream down their faces,
JER.31.9	and I will lead them home with great care.
JER.31.9	They will walk beside quiet streams
JER.31.9	and on smooth paths where they will not stumble.
JER.31.9	For I am Israel’s father,
JER.31.9	and Ephraim is my oldest child.
JER.31.10	“Listen to this message from the 
JER.31.10	you nations of the world;
JER.31.10	proclaim it in distant coastlands:
JER.31.10	The 
JER.31.10	will gather them and watch over them
JER.31.10	as a shepherd does his flock.
JER.31.11	For the 
JER.31.11	from those too strong for them.
JER.31.12	They will come home and sing songs of joy on the heights of Jerusalem.
JER.31.12	They will be radiant because of the 
JER.31.12	the abundant crops of grain, new wine, and olive oil,
JER.31.12	and the healthy flocks and herds.
JER.31.12	Their life will be like a watered garden,
JER.31.12	and all their sorrows will be gone.
JER.31.13	The young women will dance for joy,
JER.31.13	and the men—old and young—will join in the celebration.
JER.31.13	I will turn their mourning into joy.
JER.31.13	I will comfort them and exchange their sorrow for rejoicing.
JER.31.14	The priests will enjoy abundance,
JER.31.14	and my people will feast on my good gifts.
JER.31.14	I, the 
JER.31.15	This is what the 
JER.31.15	“A cry is heard in Ramah—
JER.31.15	deep anguish and bitter weeping.
JER.31.15	Rachel weeps for her children,
JER.31.15	refusing to be comforted—
JER.31.15	for her children are gone.”
JER.31.16	But now this is what the 
JER.31.16	“Do not weep any longer,
JER.31.16	for I will reward you,” says the 
JER.31.16	“Your children will come back to you
JER.31.16	from the distant land of the enemy.
JER.31.17	There is hope for your future,” says the 
JER.31.17	“Your children will come again to their own land.
JER.31.18	I have heard Israel
JER.31.18	‘You disciplined me severely,
JER.31.18	like a calf that needs training for the yoke.
JER.31.18	Turn me again to you and restore me,
JER.31.18	for you alone are the 
JER.31.19	I turned away from God,
JER.31.19	but then I was sorry.
JER.31.19	I kicked myself for my stupidity!
JER.31.19	I was thoroughly ashamed of all I did in my younger days.’
JER.31.20	“Is not Israel still my son,
JER.31.20	my darling child?” says the 
JER.31.20	“I often have to punish him,
JER.31.20	but I still love him.
JER.31.20	That’s why I long for him
JER.31.20	and surely will have mercy on him.
JER.31.21	Set up road signs;
JER.31.21	put up guideposts.
JER.31.21	Mark well the path
JER.31.21	by which you came.
JER.31.21	Come back again, my virgin Israel;
JER.31.21	return to your towns here.
JER.31.22	How long will you wander,
JER.31.22	my wayward daughter?
JER.31.22	For the 
JER.31.22	Israel will embrace her God.
JER.31.23	This is what the 
JER.31.24	Townspeople and farmers and shepherds alike will live together in peace and happiness. 
JER.31.25	For I have given rest to the weary and joy to the sorrowing.”
JER.31.26	At this, I woke up and looked around. My sleep had been very sweet.
JER.31.27	“The day is coming,” says the 
JER.31.28	In the past I deliberately uprooted and tore down this nation. I overthrew it, destroyed it, and brought disaster upon it. But in the future I will just as deliberately plant it and build it up. I, the 
JER.31.29	“The people will no longer quote this proverb:
JER.31.29	‘The parents have eaten sour grapes,
JER.31.29	but their children’s mouths pucker at the taste.’
JER.31.30	All people will die for their own sins—those who eat the sour grapes will be the ones whose mouths will pucker.
JER.31.31	“The day is coming,” says the 
JER.31.32	This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and brought them out of the land of Egypt. They broke that covenant, though I loved them as a husband loves his wife,” says the 
JER.31.33	“But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel after those days,” says the 
JER.31.34	And they will not need to teach their neighbors, nor will they need to teach their relatives, saying, ‘You should know the 
JER.31.35	It is the 
JER.31.35	and the moon and stars to light the night,
JER.31.35	and who stirs the sea into roaring waves.
JER.31.35	His name is the 
JER.31.35	and this is what he says:
JER.31.36	“I am as likely to reject my people Israel
JER.31.36	as I am to abolish the laws of nature!”
JER.31.37	This is what the 
JER.31.37	“Just as the heavens cannot be measured
JER.31.37	and the foundations of the earth cannot be explored,
JER.31.37	so I will not consider casting them away
JER.31.37	for the evil they have done.
JER.31.37	I, the 
JER.31.38	“The day is coming,” says the 
JER.31.39	A measuring line will be stretched out over the hill of Gareb and across to Goah. 
JER.31.40	And the entire area—including the graveyard and ash dump in the valley, and all the fields out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the Horse Gate—will be holy to the 
JER.32.1	The following message came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.32.2	Jerusalem was then under siege from the Babylonian army, and Jeremiah was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace. 
JER.32.3	King Zedekiah had put him there, asking why he kept giving this prophecy: “This is what the 
JER.32.4	King Zedekiah will be captured by the Babylonians
JER.32.5	He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and I will deal with him there,’ says the 
JER.32.6	At that time the 
JER.32.7	“Your cousin Hanamel son of Shallum will come and say to you, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth. By law you have the right to buy it before it is offered to anyone else.’”
JER.32.8	Then, just as the 
JER.32.9	So I bought the field at Anathoth, paying Hanamel seventeen pieces
JER.32.10	I signed and sealed the deed of purchase before witnesses, weighed out the silver, and paid him. 
JER.32.11	Then I took the sealed deed and an unsealed copy of the deed, which contained the terms and conditions of the purchase, 
JER.32.12	and I handed them to Baruch son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah. I did all this in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, the witnesses who had signed the deed, and all the men of Judah who were there in the courtyard of the guardhouse.
JER.32.13	Then I said to Baruch as they all listened, 
JER.32.14	“This is what the 
JER.32.15	For this is what the 
JER.32.16	Then after I had given the papers to Baruch, I prayed to the 
JER.32.17	“O Sovereign 
JER.32.18	You show unfailing love to thousands, but you also bring the consequences of one generation’s sin upon the next. You are the great and powerful God, the 
JER.32.19	You have all wisdom and do great and mighty miracles. You see the conduct of all people, and you give them what they deserve. 
JER.32.20	You performed miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt—things still remembered to this day! And you have continued to do great miracles in Israel and all around the world. You have made your name famous to this day.
JER.32.21	“You brought Israel out of Egypt with mighty signs and wonders, with a strong hand and powerful arm, and with overwhelming terror. 
JER.32.22	You gave the people of Israel this land that you had promised their ancestors long before—a land flowing with milk and honey. 
JER.32.23	Our ancestors came and conquered it and lived in it, but they refused to obey you or follow your word. They have not done anything you commanded. That is why you have sent this terrible disaster upon them.
JER.32.24	“See how the siege ramps have been built against the city walls! Through war, famine, and disease, the city will be handed over to the Babylonians, who will conquer it. Everything has happened just as you said. 
JER.32.25	And yet, O Sovereign 
JER.32.26	Then this message came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.32.27	“I am the 
JER.32.28	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.32.29	The Babylonians outside the walls will come in and set fire to the city. They will burn down all these houses where the people provoked my anger by burning incense to Baal on the rooftops and by pouring out liquid offerings to other gods. 
JER.32.30	Israel and Judah have done nothing but wrong since their earliest days. They have infuriated me with all their evil deeds,” says the 
JER.32.31	“From the time this city was built until now, it has done nothing but anger me, so I am determined to get rid of it.
JER.32.32	“The sins of Israel and Judah—the sins of the people of Jerusalem, the kings, the officials, the priests, and the prophets—have stirred up my anger. 
JER.32.33	My people have turned their backs on me and have refused to return. Even though I diligently taught them, they would not receive instruction or obey. 
JER.32.34	They have set up their abominable idols right in my own Temple, defiling it. 
JER.32.35	They have built pagan shrines to Baal in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and there they sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech. I have never commanded such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing. What an incredible evil, causing Judah to sin so greatly!
JER.32.36	“Now I want to say something more about this city. You have been saying, ‘It will fall to the king of Babylon through war, famine, and disease.’ But this is what the 
JER.32.37	I will certainly bring my people back again from all the countries where I will scatter them in my fury. I will bring them back to this very city and let them live in peace and safety. 
JER.32.38	They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
JER.32.39	And I will give them one heart and one purpose: to worship me forever, for their own good and for the good of all their descendants. 
JER.32.40	And I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good for them. I will put a desire in their hearts to worship me, and they will never leave me. 
JER.32.41	I will find joy doing good for them and will faithfully and wholeheartedly replant them in this land.
JER.32.42	“This is what the 
JER.32.43	Fields will again be bought and sold in this land about which you now say, ‘It has been ravaged by the Babylonians, a desolate land where people and animals have all disappeared.’ 
JER.32.44	Yes, fields will once again be bought and sold—deeds signed and sealed and witnessed—in the land of Benjamin and here in Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the hill country, in the foothills of Judah
JER.33.1	While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the 
JER.33.2	“This is what the 
JER.33.3	Ask me and I will tell you remarkable secrets you do not know about things to come. 
JER.33.4	For this is what the 
JER.33.5	You expect to fight the Babylonians,
JER.33.6	“Nevertheless, the time will come when I will heal Jerusalem’s wounds and give it prosperity and true peace. 
JER.33.7	I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild their towns. 
JER.33.8	I will cleanse them of their sins against me and forgive all their sins of rebellion. 
JER.33.9	Then this city will bring me joy, glory, and honor before all the nations of the earth! The people of the world will see all the good I do for my people, and they will tremble with awe at the peace and prosperity I provide for them.
JER.33.10	“This is what the 
JER.33.11	the sounds of joy and laughter. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will be heard again, along with the joyous songs of people bringing thanksgiving offerings to the 
JER.33.11	‘Give thanks to the 
JER.33.11	for the 
JER.33.11	His faithful love endures forever!’
JER.33.11	For I will restore the prosperity of this land to what it was in the past, says the 
JER.33.12	“This is what the 
JER.33.13	Once again shepherds will count their flocks in the towns of the hill country, the foothills of Judah,
JER.33.14	“The day will come, says the 
JER.33.15	“In those days and at that time
JER.33.15	I will raise up a righteous descendant
JER.33.15	He will do what is just and right throughout the land.
JER.33.16	In that day Judah will be saved,
JER.33.16	and Jerusalem will live in safety.
JER.33.16	And this will be its name:
JER.33.16	‘The 
JER.33.17	For this is what the 
JER.33.18	And there will always be Levitical priests to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings and sacrifices to me.”
JER.33.19	Then this message came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.33.20	“This is what the 
JER.33.21	only then will my covenant with my servant David be broken. Only then will he no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne. The same is true for my covenant with the Levitical priests who minister before me. 
JER.33.22	And as the stars of the sky cannot be counted and the sand on the seashore cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of my servant David and the Levites who minister before me.”
JER.33.23	The 
JER.33.24	“Have you noticed what people are saying?—‘The 
JER.33.25	But this is what the 
JER.33.26	I will never abandon the descendants of Jacob or David, my servant, or change the plan that David’s descendants will rule the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Instead, I will restore them to their land and have mercy on them.”

JER.34.2	“Go to King Zedekiah of Judah, and tell him, ‘This is what the 
JER.34.3	You will not escape his grasp but will be captured and taken to meet the king of Babylon face to face. Then you will be exiled to Babylon.
JER.34.4	“‘But listen to this promise from the 
JER.34.5	but will die peacefully. People will burn incense in your memory, just as they did for your ancestors, the kings who preceded you. They will mourn for you, crying, “Alas, our master is dead!” This I have decreed, says the 
JER.34.6	So Jeremiah the prophet delivered the message to King Zedekiah of Judah. 
JER.34.7	At this time the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah—the only fortified cities of Judah not yet captured.
JER.34.8	This message came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.9	He had ordered all the people to free their Hebrew slaves—both men and women. No one was to keep a fellow Judean in bondage. 
JER.34.10	The officials and all the people had obeyed the king’s command, 
JER.34.11	but later they changed their minds. They took back the men and women they had freed, forcing them to be slaves again.
JER.34.12	So the 
JER.34.13	“This is what the 
JER.34.14	I told them that every Hebrew slave must be freed after serving six years. But your ancestors paid no attention to me. 
JER.34.15	Recently you repented and did what was right, following my command. You freed your slaves and made a solemn covenant with me in the Temple that bears my name. 
JER.34.16	But now you have shrugged off your oath and defiled my name by taking back the men and women you had freed, forcing them to be slaves once again.
JER.34.17	“Therefore, this is what the 
JER.34.18	Because you have broken the terms of our covenant, I will cut you apart just as you cut apart the calf when you walked between its halves to solemnize your vows. 
JER.34.19	Yes, I will cut you apart, whether you are officials of Judah or Jerusalem, court officials, priests, or common people—for you have broken your oath. 
JER.34.20	I will give you to your enemies, and they will kill you. Your bodies will be food for the vultures and wild animals.
JER.34.21	“I will hand over King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials to the army of the king of Babylon. And although they have left Jerusalem for a while, 
JER.34.22	I will call the Babylonian armies back again. They will fight against this city and will capture it and burn it down. I will see to it that all the towns of Judah are destroyed, with no one living there.”
JER.35.1	This is the message the 
JER.35.2	“Go to the settlement where the families of the Recabites live, and invite them to the 
JER.35.3	So I went to see Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah and grandson of Habazziniah and all his brothers and sons—representing all the Recabite families. 
JER.35.4	I took them to the Temple, and we went into the room assigned to the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God. This room was located next to the one used by the Temple officials, directly above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, the Temple gatekeeper.
JER.35.5	I set cups and jugs of wine before them and invited them to have a drink, 
JER.35.6	but they refused. “No,” they said, “we don’t drink wine, because our ancestor Jehonadab
JER.35.7	And do not build houses or plant crops or vineyards, but always live in tents. If you follow these commands, you will live long, good lives in the land.’ 
JER.35.8	So we have obeyed him in all these things. We have never had a drink of wine to this day, nor have our wives, our sons, or our daughters. 
JER.35.9	We haven’t built houses or owned vineyards or farms or planted crops. 
JER.35.10	We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed all the commands of Jehonadab, our ancestor. 
JER.35.11	But when King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.35.12	Then the 
JER.35.13	“This is what the 
JER.35.14	The Recabites do not drink wine to this day because their ancestor Jehonadab told them not to. But I have spoken to you again and again, and you refuse to obey me. 
JER.35.15	Time after time I sent you prophets, who told you, “Turn from your wicked ways, and start doing things right. Stop worshiping other gods so that you might live in peace here in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you would not listen to me or obey me. 
JER.35.16	The descendants of Jehonadab son of Recab have obeyed their ancestor completely, but you have refused to listen to me.’
JER.35.17	“Therefore, this is what the 
JER.35.18	Then Jeremiah turned to the Recabites and said, “This is what the 
JER.35.19	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.36.1	During the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king in Judah,
JER.36.2	“Get a scroll, and write down all my messages against Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Begin with the first message back in the days of Josiah, and write down every message, right up to the present time. 
JER.36.3	Perhaps the people of Judah will repent when they hear again all the terrible things I have planned for them. Then I will be able to forgive their sins and wrongdoings.”
JER.36.4	So Jeremiah sent for Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated all the prophecies that the 
JER.36.5	Then Jeremiah said to Baruch, “I am a prisoner here and unable to go to the Temple. 
JER.36.6	So you go to the Temple on the next day of fasting, and read the messages from the 
JER.36.7	Perhaps even yet they will turn from their evil ways and ask the 
JER.36.8	Baruch did as Jeremiah told him and read these messages from the 
JER.36.9	He did this on a day of sacred fasting held in late autumn,
JER.36.10	Baruch read Jeremiah’s words on the scroll to all the people. He stood in front of the Temple room of Gemariah, son of Shaphan the secretary. This room was just off the upper courtyard of the Temple, near the New Gate entrance.
JER.36.11	When Micaiah son of Gemariah and grandson of Shaphan heard the messages from the 
JER.36.12	he went down to the secretary’s room in the palace where the administrative officials were meeting. Elishama the secretary was there, along with Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. 
JER.36.13	When Micaiah told them about the messages Baruch was reading to the people, 
JER.36.14	the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, grandson of Shelemiah and great-grandson of Cushi, to ask Baruch to come and read the messages to them, too. So Baruch took the scroll and went to them. 
JER.36.15	“Sit down and read the scroll to us,” the officials said, and Baruch did as they requested.
JER.36.16	When they heard all the messages, they looked at one another in alarm. “We must tell the king what we have heard,” they said to Baruch. 
JER.36.17	“But first, tell us how you got these messages. Did they come directly from Jeremiah?”
JER.36.18	So Baruch explained, “Jeremiah dictated them, and I wrote them down in ink, word for word, on this scroll.”
JER.36.19	“You and Jeremiah should both hide,” the officials told Baruch. “Don’t tell anyone where you are!” 
JER.36.20	Then the officials left the scroll for safekeeping in the room of Elishama the secretary and went to tell the king what had happened.
JER.36.21	The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. Jehudi brought it from Elishama’s room and read it to the king as all his officials stood by. 
JER.36.22	It was late autumn, and the king was in a winterized part of the palace, sitting in front of a fire to keep warm. 
JER.36.23	Each time Jehudi finished reading three or four columns, the king took a knife and cut off that section of the scroll. He then threw it into the fire, section by section, until the whole scroll was burned up. 
JER.36.24	Neither the king nor his attendants showed any signs of fear or repentance at what they heard. 
JER.36.25	Even when Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll, he wouldn’t listen.
JER.36.26	Then the king commanded his son Jerahmeel, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah. But the 
JER.36.27	After the king had burned the scroll on which Baruch had written Jeremiah’s words, the 
JER.36.28	“Get another scroll, and write everything again just as you did on the scroll King Jehoiakim burned. 
JER.36.29	Then say to the king, ‘This is what the 
JER.36.30	Now this is what the 
JER.36.31	I will punish him and his family and his attendants for their sins. I will pour out on them and on all the people of Jerusalem and Judah all the disasters I promised, for they would not listen to my warnings.’”
JER.36.32	So Jeremiah took another scroll and dictated again to his secretary, Baruch. He wrote everything that had been on the scroll King Jehoiakim had burned in the fire. Only this time he added much more!
JER.37.1	Zedekiah son of Josiah succeeded Jehoiachin
JER.37.2	But neither King Zedekiah nor his attendants nor the people who were left in the land listened to what the 
JER.37.3	Nevertheless, King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest, son of Maaseiah, to ask Jeremiah, “Please pray to the 
JER.37.4	Jeremiah had not yet been imprisoned, so he could come and go among the people as he pleased.
JER.37.5	At this time the army of Pharaoh Hophra
JER.37.6	Then the 
JER.37.7	“This is what the 
JER.37.8	Then the Babylonians
JER.37.9	“This is what the 
JER.37.10	Even if you were to destroy the entire Babylonian army, leaving only a handful of wounded survivors, they would still stagger from their tents and burn this city to the ground!”
JER.37.11	When the Babylonian army left Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s approaching army, 
JER.37.12	Jeremiah started to leave the city on his way to the territory of Benjamin, to claim his share of the property among his relatives there.
JER.37.13	But as he was walking through the Benjamin Gate, a sentry arrested him and said, “You are defecting to the Babylonians!” The sentry making the arrest was Irijah son of Shelemiah, grandson of Hananiah.
JER.37.14	“That’s not true!” Jeremiah protested. “I had no intention of doing any such thing.” But Irijah wouldn’t listen, and he took Jeremiah before the officials. 
JER.37.15	They were furious with Jeremiah and had him flogged and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary. Jonathan’s house had been converted into a prison. 
JER.37.16	Jeremiah was put into a dungeon cell, where he remained for many days.
JER.37.17	Later King Zedekiah secretly requested that Jeremiah come to the palace, where the king asked him, “Do you have any messages from the 
JER.37.17	“Yes, I do!” said Jeremiah. “You will be defeated by the king of Babylon.”
JER.37.18	Then Jeremiah asked the king, “What crime have I committed? What have I done against you, your attendants, or the people that I should be imprisoned like this? 
JER.37.19	Where are your prophets now who told you the king of Babylon would not attack you or this land? 
JER.37.20	Listen, my lord the king, I beg you. Don’t send me back to the dungeon in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for I will die there.”
JER.37.21	So King Zedekiah commanded that Jeremiah not be returned to the dungeon. Instead, he was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace. The king also commanded that Jeremiah be given a loaf of fresh bread every day as long as there was any left in the city. So Jeremiah was put in the palace prison.
JER.38.1	Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal
JER.38.2	“This is what the 
JER.38.3	The 
JER.38.4	So these officials went to the king and said, “Sir, this man must die! That kind of talk will undermine the morale of the few fighting men we have left, as well as that of all the people. This man is a traitor!”
JER.38.5	King Zedekiah agreed. “All right,” he said. “Do as you like. I can’t stop you.”
JER.38.6	So the officials took Jeremiah from his cell and lowered him by ropes into an empty cistern in the prison yard. It belonged to Malkijah, a member of the royal family. There was no water in the cistern, but there was a thick layer of mud at the bottom, and Jeremiah sank down into it.
JER.38.7	But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian,
JER.38.8	so Ebed-melech rushed from the palace to speak with him. 
JER.38.9	“My lord the king,” he said, “these men have done a very evil thing in putting Jeremiah the prophet into the cistern. He will soon die of hunger, for almost all the bread in the city is gone.”
JER.38.10	So the king told Ebed-melech, “Take thirty of my men with you, and pull Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies.”
JER.38.11	So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to a room in the palace beneath the treasury, where he found some old rags and discarded clothing. He carried these to the cistern and lowered them to Jeremiah on a rope. 
JER.38.12	Ebed-melech called down to Jeremiah, “Put these rags under your armpits to protect you from the ropes.” Then when Jeremiah was ready, 
JER.38.13	they pulled him out. So Jeremiah was returned to the courtyard of the guard—the palace prison—where he remained.
JER.38.14	One day King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and had him brought to the third entrance of the 
JER.38.15	Jeremiah said, “If I tell you the truth, you will kill me. And if I give you advice, you won’t listen to me anyway.”
JER.38.16	So King Zedekiah secretly promised him, “As surely as the 
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the 
JER.38.18	But if you refuse to surrender, you will not escape! This city will be handed over to the Babylonians, and they will burn it to the ground.’”
JER.38.19	“But I am afraid to surrender,” the king said, “for the Babylonians may hand me over to the Judeans who have defected to them. And who knows what they will do to me!”
JER.38.20	Jeremiah replied, “You won’t be handed over to them if you choose to obey the 
JER.38.21	But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the 
JER.38.22	All the women left in your palace will be brought out and given to the officers of the Babylonian army. Then the women will taunt you, saying,
JER.38.22	‘What fine friends you have!
JER.38.22	They have betrayed and misled you.
JER.38.22	When your feet sank in the mud,
JER.38.22	they left you to your fate!’
JER.38.23	All your wives and children will be led out to the Babylonians, and you will not escape. You will be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned down.”
JER.38.24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Don’t tell anyone you told me this, or you will die! 
JER.38.25	My officials may hear that I spoke to you, and they may say, ‘Tell us what you and the king were talking about. If you don’t tell us, we will kill you.’ 
JER.38.26	If this happens, just tell them you begged me not to send you back to Jonathan’s dungeon, for fear you would die there.”
JER.38.27	Sure enough, it wasn’t long before the king’s officials came to Jeremiah and asked him why the king had called for him. But Jeremiah followed the king’s instructions, and they left without finding out the truth. No one had overheard the conversation between Jeremiah and the king. 
JER.38.28	And Jeremiah remained a prisoner in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
JER.39.1	In January
JER.39.2	Two and a half years later, on July 18
JER.39.3	All the officers of the Babylonian army came in and sat in triumph at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer of Samgar, and Nebo-sarsekim,
JER.39.4	When King Zedekiah of Judah and all the soldiers saw that the Babylonians had broken into the city, they fled. They waited for nightfall and then slipped through the gate between the two walls behind the king’s garden and headed toward the Jordan Valley.
JER.39.5	But the Babylonian
JER.39.6	The king of Babylon made Zedekiah watch as he slaughtered his sons at Riblah. The king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. 
JER.39.7	Then he gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in bronze chains to lead him away to Babylon.
JER.39.8	Meanwhile, the Babylonians burned Jerusalem, including the royal palace and the houses of the people, and they tore down the walls of the city. 
JER.39.9	Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took as exiles to Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city, those who had defected to him, and everyone else who remained. 
JER.39.10	But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind in the land of Judah, and he assigned them to care for the vineyards and fields.
JER.39.11	King Nebuchadnezzar had told Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, to find Jeremiah. 
JER.39.12	“See that he isn’t hurt,” he said. “Look after him well, and give him anything he wants.” 
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard; Nebushazban, a chief officer; Nergal-sharezer, the king’s adviser; and the other officers of Babylon’s king 
JER.39.14	sent messengers to bring Jeremiah out of the prison. They put him under the care of Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, who took him back to his home. So Jeremiah stayed in Judah among his own people.
JER.39.15	The 
JER.39.16	“Say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian,
JER.39.17	but I will rescue you from those you fear so much. 
JER.39.18	Because you trusted me, I will give you your life as a reward. I will rescue you and keep you safe. I, the 
JER.40.1	The 
JER.40.2	The captain of the guard called for Jeremiah and said, “The 
JER.40.3	just as he said he would. For these people have sinned against the 
JER.40.4	But I am going to take off your chains and let you go. If you want to come with me to Babylon, you are welcome. I will see that you are well cared for. But if you don’t want to come, you may stay here. The whole land is before you—go wherever you like. 
JER.40.5	If you decide to stay, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. He has been appointed governor of Judah by the king of Babylon. Stay there with the people he rules. But it’s up to you; go wherever you like.”
JER.40.5	Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, gave Jeremiah some food and money and let him go. 
JER.40.6	So Jeremiah returned to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and he lived in Judah with the few who were still left in the land.
JER.40.7	The leaders of the Judean military groups in the countryside heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the poor people who were left behind in Judah—the men, women, and children who hadn’t been exiled to Babylon. 
JER.40.8	So they went to see Gedaliah at Mizpah. These included: Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah son of the Maacathite, and all their men.
JER.40.9	Gedaliah vowed to them that the Babylonians
JER.40.10	“As for me, I will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to meet with us. Settle in the towns you have taken, and live off the land. Harvest the grapes and summer fruits and olives, and store them away.”
JER.40.11	When the Judeans in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and the other nearby countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a few people in Judah and that Gedaliah was the governor, 
JER.40.12	they began to return to Judah from the places to which they had fled. They stopped at Mizpah to meet with Gedaliah and then went into the Judean countryside to gather a great harvest of grapes and other crops.
JER.40.13	Soon after this, Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. 
JER.40.14	They said to him, “Did you know that Baalis, king of Ammon, has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to assassinate you?” But Gedaliah refused to believe them.
JER.40.15	Later Johanan had a private conference with Gedaliah and volunteered to kill Ishmael secretly. “Why should we let him come and murder you?” Johanan asked. “What will happen then to the Judeans who have returned? Why should the few of us who are still left be scattered and lost?”
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah said to Johanan, “I forbid you to do any such thing, for you are lying about Ishmael.”
JER.41.1	But in midautumn of that year,
JER.41.2	Ishmael and his ten men suddenly jumped up, drew their swords, and killed Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor. 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also killed all the Judeans and the Babylonian
JER.41.4	The next day, before anyone had heard about Gedaliah’s murder, 
JER.41.5	eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria to worship at the Temple of the 
JER.41.6	Ishmael left Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he reached them, he said, “Oh, come and see what has happened to Gedaliah!”
JER.41.7	But as soon as they were all inside the town, Ishmael and his men killed all but ten of them and threw their bodies into a cistern. 
JER.41.8	The other ten had talked Ishmael into letting them go by promising to bring him their stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey that they had hidden away. 
JER.41.9	The cistern where Ishmael dumped the bodies of the men he murdered was the large one
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael made captives of the king’s daughters and the other people who had been left under Gedaliah’s care in Mizpah by Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard. Taking them with him, he started back toward the land of Ammon.
JER.41.11	But when Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders heard about Ishmael’s crimes, 
JER.41.12	they took all their men and set out to stop him. They caught up with him at the large pool near Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	The people Ishmael had captured shouted for joy when they saw Johanan and the other military leaders. 
JER.41.14	And all the captives from Mizpah escaped and began to help Johanan. 
JER.41.15	Meanwhile, Ishmael and eight of his men escaped from Johanan into the land of Ammon.
JER.41.16	Then Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders took all the people they had rescued in Gibeon—the soldiers, women, children, and court officials
JER.41.17	They took them all to the village of Geruth-kimham near Bethlehem, where they prepared to leave for Egypt. 
JER.41.18	They were afraid of what the Babylonians
JER.42.1	Then all the military leaders, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah
JER.42.2	Jeremiah the prophet. They said, “Please pray to the 
JER.42.3	Pray that the 
JER.42.4	“All right,” Jeremiah replied. “I will pray to the 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the 
JER.42.6	Whether we like it or not, we will obey the 
JER.42.7	Ten days later the 
JER.42.8	So he called for Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders, and for all the people, from the least to the greatest. 
JER.42.9	He said to them, “You sent me to the 
JER.42.10	‘Stay here in this land. If you do, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you. For I am sorry about all the punishment I have had to bring upon you. 
JER.42.11	Do not fear the king of Babylon anymore,’ says the 
JER.42.12	I will be merciful to you by making him kind, so he will let you stay here in your land.’
JER.42.13	“But if you refuse to obey the 
JER.42.14	instead, we will go to Egypt where we will be free from war, the call to arms, and hunger,’ 
JER.42.15	then hear the 
JER.42.16	the very war and famine you fear will catch up to you, and you will die there. 
JER.42.17	That is the fate awaiting every one of you who insists on going to live in Egypt. Yes, you will die from war, famine, and disease. None of you will escape the disaster I will bring upon you there.’
JER.42.18	“This is what the 
JER.42.19	“Listen, you remnant of Judah. The 
JER.42.20	For you were not being honest when you sent me to pray to the 
JER.42.21	And today I have told you exactly what he said, but you will not obey the 
JER.42.22	So you can be sure that you will die from war, famine, and disease in Egypt, where you insist on going.”
JER.43.1	When Jeremiah had finished giving this message from the 
JER.43.2	Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other proud men said to Jeremiah, “You lie! The 
JER.43.3	Baruch son of Neriah has convinced you to say this, because he wants us to stay here and be killed by the Babylonians
JER.43.4	So Johanan and the other military leaders and all the people refused to obey the 
JER.43.5	Johanan and the other leaders took with them all the people who had returned from the nearby countries to which they had fled. 
JER.43.6	In the crowd were men, women, and children, the king’s daughters, and all those whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had left with Gedaliah. The prophet Jeremiah and Baruch were also included. 
JER.43.7	The people refused to obey the voice of the 
JER.43.8	Then at Tahpanhes, the 
JER.43.9	“While the people of Judah are watching, take some large rocks and bury them under the pavement stones at the entrance of Pharaoh’s palace here in Tahpanhes. 
JER.43.10	Then say to the people of Judah, ‘This is what the 
JER.43.11	And when he comes, he will destroy the land of Egypt. He will bring death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and war to those destined for war. 
JER.43.12	He will set fire to the temples of Egypt’s gods; he will burn the temples and carry the idols away as plunder. He will pick clean the land of Egypt as a shepherd picks fleas from his cloak. And he himself will leave unharmed. 
JER.43.13	He will break down the sacred pillars standing in the temple of the sun
JER.44.1	This is the message Jeremiah received concerning the Judeans living in northern Egypt in the cities of Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis,
JER.44.2	“This is what the 
JER.44.3	They provoked my anger with all their wickedness. They burned incense and worshiped other gods—gods that neither they nor you nor any of your ancestors had ever even known.
JER.44.4	“Again and again I sent my servants, the prophets, to plead with them, ‘Don’t do these horrible things that I hate so much.’ 
JER.44.5	But my people would not listen or turn back from their wicked ways. They kept on burning incense to these gods. 
JER.44.6	And so my fury boiled over and fell like fire on the towns of Judah and into the streets of Jerusalem, and they are still a desolate ruin today.
JER.44.7	“And now the 
JER.44.8	Why provoke my anger by burning incense to the idols you have made here in Egypt? You will only destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and mockery for all the nations of the earth. 
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten the sins of your ancestors, the sins of the kings and queens of Judah, and the sins you and your wives committed in Judah and Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	To this very hour you have shown no remorse or reverence. No one has chosen to follow my word and the decrees I gave to you and your ancestors before you.
JER.44.11	“Therefore, this is what the 
JER.44.12	I will take this remnant of Judah—those who were determined to come here and live in Egypt—and I will consume them. They will fall here in Egypt, killed by war and famine. All will die, from the least to the greatest. They will be an object of damnation, horror, cursing, and mockery. 
JER.44.13	I will punish them in Egypt just as I punished them in Jerusalem, by war, famine, and disease. 
JER.44.14	Of that remnant who fled to Egypt, hoping someday to return to Judah, there will be no survivors. Even though they long to return home, only a handful will do so.”
JER.44.15	Then all the women present and all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to idols—a great crowd of all the Judeans living in northern Egypt and southern Egypt
JER.44.16	“We will not listen to your messages from the 
JER.44.17	We will do whatever we want. We will burn incense and pour out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven just as much as we like—just as we, and our ancestors, and our kings and officials have always done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For in those days we had plenty to eat, and we were well off and had no troubles! 
JER.44.18	But ever since we quit burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and stopped worshiping her with liquid offerings, we have been in great trouble and have been dying from war and famine.”
JER.44.19	“Besides,” the women added, “do you suppose that we were burning incense and pouring out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven, and making cakes marked with her image, without our husbands knowing it and helping us? Of course not!”
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said to all of them, men and women alike, who had given him that answer, 
JER.44.21	“Do you think the 
JER.44.22	It was because the 
JER.44.23	All these terrible things happened to you because you have burned incense to idols and sinned against the 
JER.44.24	Then Jeremiah said to them all, including the women, “Listen to this message from the 
JER.44.25	This is what the 
JER.44.26	“But listen to this message from the 
JER.44.27	For I will watch over you to bring you disaster and not good. Everyone from Judah who is now living in Egypt will suffer war and famine until all of you are dead. 
JER.44.28	Only a small number will escape death and return to Judah from Egypt. Then all those who came to Egypt will find out whose words are true—mine or theirs!
JER.44.29	“‘And this is the proof I give you,’ says the 
JER.44.30	This is what the 
JER.45.1	The prophet Jeremiah gave a message to Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah,
JER.45.2	“This is what the 
JER.45.3	You have said, ‘I am overwhelmed with trouble! Haven’t I had enough pain already? And now the 
JER.45.4	“Baruch, this is what the 
JER.45.5	Are you seeking great things for yourself? Don’t do it! I will bring great disaster upon all these people; but I will give you your life as a reward wherever you go. I, the 
JER.46.1	The following messages were given to Jeremiah the prophet from the 
JER.46.2	This message concerning Egypt was given in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, the king of Judah, on the occasion of the battle of Carchemish
JER.46.3	“Prepare your shields,
JER.46.3	and advance into battle!
JER.46.4	Harness the horses,
JER.46.4	and mount the stallions.
JER.46.4	Take your positions.
JER.46.4	Put on your helmets.
JER.46.4	Sharpen your spears,
JER.46.4	and prepare your armor.
JER.46.5	But what do I see?
JER.46.5	The Egyptian army flees in terror.
JER.46.5	The bravest of its fighting men run
JER.46.5	without a backward glance.
JER.46.5	They are terrorized at every turn,”
JER.46.5	says the 
JER.46.6	“The swiftest runners cannot flee;
JER.46.6	the mightiest warriors cannot escape.
JER.46.6	By the Euphrates River to the north,
JER.46.6	they stumble and fall.
JER.46.7	“Who is this, rising like the Nile at floodtime,
JER.46.7	overflowing all the land?
JER.46.8	It is the Egyptian army,
JER.46.8	overflowing all the land,
JER.46.8	boasting that it will cover the earth like a flood,
JER.46.8	destroying cities and their people.
JER.46.9	Charge, you horses and chariots;
JER.46.9	attack, you mighty warriors of Egypt!
JER.46.9	Come, all you allies from Ethiopia, Libya, and Lydia
JER.46.9	who are skilled with the shield and bow!
JER.46.10	For this is the day of the Lord, the 
JER.46.10	a day of vengeance on his enemies.
JER.46.10	The sword will devour until it is satisfied,
JER.46.10	yes, until it is drunk with your blood!
JER.46.10	The Lord, the 
JER.46.10	in the north country beside the Euphrates River.
JER.46.11	“Go up to Gilead to get medicine,
JER.46.11	O virgin daughter of Egypt!
JER.46.11	But your many treatments
JER.46.11	will bring you no healing.
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of your shame.
JER.46.12	The earth is filled with your cries of despair.
JER.46.12	Your mightiest warriors will run into each other
JER.46.12	and fall down together.”
JER.46.13	Then the 
JER.46.14	“Shout it out in Egypt!
JER.46.14	Publish it in the cities of Migdol, Memphis,
JER.46.14	Mobilize for battle,
JER.46.14	for the sword will devour everyone around you.
JER.46.15	Why have your warriors fallen?
JER.46.15	They cannot stand, for the 
JER.46.16	They stumble and fall over each other
JER.46.16	and say among themselves,
JER.46.16	‘Come, let’s go back to our people,
JER.46.16	to the land of our birth.
JER.46.16	Let’s get away from the sword of the enemy!’
JER.46.17	There they will say,
JER.46.17	‘Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is a loudmouth
JER.46.17	who missed his opportunity!’
JER.46.18	“As surely as I live,” says the King,
JER.46.18	whose name is the 
JER.46.18	“one is coming against Egypt
JER.46.18	who is as tall as Mount Tabor,
JER.46.18	or as Mount Carmel by the sea!
JER.46.19	Pack up! Get ready to leave for exile,
JER.46.19	you citizens of Egypt!
JER.46.19	The city of Memphis will be destroyed,
JER.46.19	without a single inhabitant.
JER.46.20	Egypt is as sleek as a beautiful heifer,
JER.46.20	but a horsefly from the north is on its way!
JER.46.21	Egypt’s mercenaries have become like fattened calves.
JER.46.21	They, too, will turn and run,
JER.46.21	for it is a day of great disaster for Egypt,
JER.46.21	a time of great punishment.
JER.46.22	Egypt flees, silent as a serpent gliding away.
JER.46.22	The invading army marches in;
JER.46.22	they come against her with axes like woodsmen.
JER.46.23	They will cut down her people like trees,” says the 
JER.46.23	“for they are more numerous than locusts.
JER.46.24	Egypt will be humiliated;
JER.46.24	she will be handed over to people from the north.”
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	I will hand them over to those who want them killed—to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his army. But afterward the land will recover from the ravages of war. I, the 
JER.46.27	“But do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant;
JER.46.27	do not be dismayed, Israel.
JER.46.27	For I will bring you home again from distant lands,
JER.46.27	and your children will return from their exile.
JER.46.27	Israel
JER.46.27	and no one will terrorize them.
JER.46.28	Do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant,
JER.46.28	for I am with you,” says the 
JER.46.28	“I will completely destroy the nations to which I have exiled you,
JER.46.28	but I will not completely destroy you.
JER.46.28	I will discipline you, but with justice;
JER.46.28	I cannot let you go unpunished.”
JER.47.1	This is the 
JER.47.2	This is what the 
JER.47.2	“A flood is coming from the north
JER.47.2	to overflow the land.
JER.47.2	It will destroy the land and everything in it—
JER.47.2	cities and people alike.
JER.47.2	People will scream in terror,
JER.47.2	and everyone in the land will wail.
JER.47.3	Hear the clatter of stallions’ hooves
JER.47.3	and the rumble of wheels as the chariots rush by.
JER.47.3	Terrified fathers run madly,
JER.47.3	without a backward glance at their helpless children.
JER.47.4	“The time has come for the Philistines to be destroyed,
JER.47.4	along with their allies from Tyre and Sidon.
JER.47.4	Yes, the 
JER.47.4	those colonists from the island of Crete.
JER.47.5	Gaza will be humiliated, its head shaved bald;
JER.47.5	Ashkelon will lie silent.
JER.47.5	You remnant from the Mediterranean coast,
JER.47.5	how long will you cut yourselves in mourning?
JER.47.6	“Now, O sword of the 
JER.47.6	when will you be at rest again?
JER.47.6	Go back into your sheath;
JER.47.6	rest and be still.
JER.47.7	“But how can it be still
JER.47.7	when the 
JER.47.7	For the city of Ashkelon
JER.47.7	and the people living along the sea
JER.47.7	must be destroyed.”
JER.48.1	This message was given concerning Moab. This is what the 
JER.48.1	“What sorrow awaits the city of Nebo;
JER.48.1	it will soon lie in ruins.
JER.48.1	The city of Kiriathaim will be humiliated and captured;
JER.48.1	the fortress will be humiliated and broken down.
JER.48.2	No one will ever brag about Moab again,
JER.48.2	for in Heshbon there is a plot to destroy her.
JER.48.2	‘Come,’ they say, ‘we will cut her off from being a nation.’
JER.48.2	The town of Madmen,
JER.48.2	the sword will follow you there.
JER.48.3	Listen to the cries from Horonaim,
JER.48.3	cries of devastation and great destruction.
JER.48.4	All Moab is destroyed.
JER.48.4	Her little ones will cry out.
JER.48.5	Her refugees weep bitterly,
JER.48.5	climbing the slope to Luhith.
JER.48.5	They cry out in terror,
JER.48.5	descending the slope to Horonaim.
JER.48.6	Flee for your lives!
JER.48.6	Hide
JER.48.7	Because you have trusted in your wealth and skill,
JER.48.7	you will be taken captive.
JER.48.7	Your god Chemosh, with his priests and officials,
JER.48.7	will be hauled off to distant lands!
JER.48.8	“All the towns will be destroyed,
JER.48.8	and no one will escape—
JER.48.8	either on the plateaus or in the valleys,
JER.48.8	for the 
JER.48.9	Oh, that Moab had wings
JER.48.9	so she could fly away,
JER.48.9	for her towns will be left empty,
JER.48.9	with no one living in them.
JER.48.10	Cursed are those who refuse to do the 
JER.48.10	who hold back their swords from shedding blood!
JER.48.11	“From his earliest history, Moab has lived in peace,
JER.48.11	never going into exile.
JER.48.11	He is like wine that has been allowed to settle.
JER.48.11	He has not been poured from flask to flask,
JER.48.11	and he is now fragrant and smooth.
JER.48.12	But the time is coming soon,” says the 
JER.48.12	“when I will send men to pour him from his jar.
JER.48.12	They will pour him out,
JER.48.12	then shatter the jar!
JER.48.13	At last Moab will be ashamed of his idol Chemosh,
JER.48.13	as the people of Israel were ashamed of their gold calf at Bethel.
JER.48.14	“You used to boast, ‘We are heroes,
JER.48.14	mighty men of war.’
JER.48.15	But now Moab and his towns will be destroyed.
JER.48.15	His most promising youth are doomed to slaughter,”
JER.48.15	says the King, whose name is the 
JER.48.16	“Destruction is coming fast for Moab;
JER.48.16	calamity threatens ominously.
JER.48.17	You friends of Moab,
JER.48.17	weep for him and cry!
JER.48.17	See how the strong scepter is broken,
JER.48.17	how the beautiful staff is shattered!
JER.48.18	“Come down from your glory
JER.48.18	and sit in the dust, you people of Dibon,
JER.48.18	for those who destroy Moab will shatter Dibon, too.
JER.48.18	They will tear down all your towers.
JER.48.19	You people of Aroer,
JER.48.19	stand beside the road and watch.
JER.48.19	Shout to those who flee from Moab,
JER.48.19	‘What has happened there?’
JER.48.20	“And the reply comes back,
JER.48.20	‘Moab lies in ruins, disgraced;
JER.48.20	weep and wail!
JER.48.20	Tell it by the banks of the Arnon River:
JER.48.20	Moab has been destroyed!’
JER.48.21	Judgment has been poured out on the towns of the plateau—
JER.48.21	on Holon and Jahaz
JER.48.22	on Dibon and Nebo and Beth-diblathaim,
JER.48.23	on Kiriathaim and Beth-gamul and Beth-meon,
JER.48.24	on Kerioth and Bozrah—
JER.48.24	all the towns of Moab, far and near.
JER.48.25	“The strength of Moab has ended.
JER.48.25	His arm has been broken,” says the 
JER.48.26	“Let him stagger and fall like a drunkard,
JER.48.26	for he has rebelled against the 
JER.48.26	Moab will wallow in his own vomit,
JER.48.26	ridiculed by all.
JER.48.27	Did you not ridicule the people of Israel?
JER.48.27	Were they caught in the company of thieves
JER.48.27	that you should despise them as you do?
JER.48.28	“You people of Moab,
JER.48.28	flee from your towns and live in the caves.
JER.48.28	Hide like doves that nest
JER.48.28	in the clefts of the rocks.
JER.48.29	We have all heard of the pride of Moab,
JER.48.29	for his pride is very great.
JER.48.29	We know of his lofty pride,
JER.48.29	his arrogance, and his haughty heart.
JER.48.30	I know about his insolence,”
JER.48.30	says the 
JER.48.30	“but his boasts are empty—
JER.48.30	as empty as his deeds.
JER.48.31	So now I wail for Moab;
JER.48.31	yes, I will mourn for Moab.
JER.48.31	My heart is broken for the men of Kir-hareseth.
JER.48.32	“You people of Sibmah, rich in vineyards,
JER.48.32	I will weep for you even more than I did for Jazer.
JER.48.32	Your spreading vines once reached as far as the Dead Sea,
JER.48.32	but the destroyer has stripped you bare!
JER.48.32	He has harvested your grapes and summer fruits.
JER.48.33	Joy and gladness are gone from fruitful Moab.
JER.48.33	The presses yield no wine.
JER.48.33	No one treads the grapes with shouts of joy.
JER.48.33	There is shouting, yes, but not of joy.
JER.48.34	“Instead, their awful cries of terror can be heard from Heshbon clear across to Elealeh and Jahaz; from Zoar all the way to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah. Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up now.
JER.48.35	“I will put an end to Moab,” says the 
JER.48.36	My heart moans like a flute for Moab and Kir-hareseth, for all their wealth has disappeared. 
JER.48.37	The people shave their heads and beards in mourning. They slash their hands and put on clothes made of burlap. 
JER.48.38	There is crying and sorrow in every Moabite home and on every street. For I have smashed Moab like an old, unwanted jar. 
JER.48.39	How it is shattered! Hear the wailing! See the shame of Moab! It has become an object of ridicule, an example of ruin to all its neighbors.”
JER.48.40	This is what the 
JER.48.40	“Look! The enemy swoops down like an eagle,
JER.48.40	spreading his wings over Moab.
JER.48.41	Its cities will fall,
JER.48.41	and its strongholds will be seized.
JER.48.41	Even the mightiest warriors will be in anguish
JER.48.41	like a woman in labor.
JER.48.42	Moab will no longer be a nation,
JER.48.42	for it has boasted against the 
JER.48.43	“Terror and traps and snares will be your lot,
JER.48.43	O Moab,” says the 
JER.48.44	“Those who flee in terror will fall into a trap,
JER.48.44	and those who escape the trap will step into a snare.
JER.48.44	I will see to it that you do not get away,
JER.48.44	for the time of your judgment has come,”
JER.48.44	says the 
JER.48.45	“The people flee as far as Heshbon
JER.48.45	but are unable to go on.
JER.48.45	For a fire comes from Heshbon,
JER.48.45	King Sihon’s ancient home,
JER.48.45	to devour the entire land
JER.48.45	with all its rebellious people.
JER.48.46	“What sorrow awaits you, O people of Moab!
JER.48.46	The people of the god Chemosh are destroyed!
JER.48.46	Your sons and your daughters
JER.48.46	have been taken away as captives.
JER.48.47	But I will restore the fortunes of Moab
JER.48.47	in days to come.
JER.48.47	I, the 
JER.48.47	This is the end of Jeremiah’s prophecy concerning Moab.
JER.49.1	This message was given concerning the Ammonites. This is what the 
JER.49.1	“Are there no descendants of Israel
JER.49.1	to inherit the land of Gad?
JER.49.1	Why are you, who worship Molech,
JER.49.1	living in its towns?
JER.49.2	In the days to come,” says the 
JER.49.2	“I will sound the battle cry against your city of Rabbah.
JER.49.2	It will become a desolate heap of ruins,
JER.49.2	and the neighboring towns will be burned.
JER.49.2	Then Israel will take back the land
JER.49.2	you took from her,” says the 
JER.49.3	“Cry out, O Heshbon,
JER.49.3	for the town of Ai is destroyed.
JER.49.3	Weep, O people of Rabbah!
JER.49.3	Put on your clothes of mourning.
JER.49.3	Weep and wail, hiding in the hedges,
JER.49.3	for your god Molech, with his priests and officials,
JER.49.3	will be hauled off to distant lands.
JER.49.4	You are proud of your fertile valleys,
JER.49.4	but they will soon be ruined.
JER.49.4	You trusted in your wealth,
JER.49.4	you rebellious daughter,
JER.49.4	and thought no one could ever harm you.
JER.49.5	But look! I will bring terror upon you,”
JER.49.5	says the Lord, the 
JER.49.5	“Your neighbors will chase you from your land,
JER.49.5	and no one will help your exiles as they flee.
JER.49.6	But I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites
JER.49.6	in days to come.
JER.49.6	I, the 
JER.49.7	This message was given concerning Edom. This is what the 
JER.49.7	“Is there no wisdom in Teman?
JER.49.7	Is no one left to give wise counsel?
JER.49.8	Turn and flee!
JER.49.8	Hide in deep caves, you people of Dedan!
JER.49.8	For when I bring disaster on Edom,
JER.49.8	I will punish you, too!
JER.49.9	Those who harvest grapes
JER.49.9	always leave a few for the poor.
JER.49.9	If thieves came at night,
JER.49.9	they would not take everything.
JER.49.10	But I will strip bare the land of Edom,
JER.49.10	and there will be no place left to hide.
JER.49.10	Its children, its brothers, and its neighbors
JER.49.10	will all be destroyed,
JER.49.10	and Edom itself will be no more.
JER.49.11	But I will protect the orphans who remain among you.
JER.49.11	Your widows, too, can depend on me for help.”
JER.49.12	And this is what the 
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by my own name,” says the 
JER.49.14	I have heard a message from the 
JER.49.14	that an ambassador was sent to the nations to say,
JER.49.14	“Form a coalition against Edom,
JER.49.14	and prepare for battle!”
JER.49.15	The 
JER.49.15	“I will cut you down to size among the nations.
JER.49.15	You will be despised by all.
JER.49.16	You have been deceived
JER.49.16	by the fear you inspire in others
JER.49.16	and by your own pride.
JER.49.16	You live in a rock fortress
JER.49.16	and control the mountain heights.
JER.49.16	But even if you make your nest among the peaks with the eagles,
JER.49.16	I will bring you crashing down,”
JER.49.16	says the 
JER.49.17	“Edom will be an object of horror.
JER.49.17	All who pass by will be appalled
JER.49.17	and will gasp at the destruction they see there.
JER.49.18	It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
JER.49.18	and their neighboring towns,” says the 
JER.49.18	“No one will live there;
JER.49.18	no one will inhabit it.
JER.49.19	I will come like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan,
JER.49.19	leaping on the sheep in the pasture.
JER.49.19	I will chase Edom from its land,
JER.49.19	and I will appoint the leader of my choice.
JER.49.19	For who is like me, and who can challenge me?
JER.49.19	What ruler can oppose my will?”
JER.49.20	Listen to the 
JER.49.20	and the people of Teman.
JER.49.20	Even the little children will be dragged off like sheep,
JER.49.20	and their homes will be destroyed.
JER.49.21	The earth will shake with the noise of Edom’s fall,
JER.49.21	and its cry of despair will be heard all the way to the Red Sea.
JER.49.22	Look! The enemy swoops down like an eagle,
JER.49.22	spreading his wings over Bozrah.
JER.49.22	Even the mightiest warriors will be in anguish
JER.49.22	like a woman in labor.
JER.49.23	This message was given concerning Damascus. This is what the 
JER.49.23	“The towns of Hamath and Arpad are struck with fear,
JER.49.23	for they have heard the news of their destruction.
JER.49.23	Their hearts are troubled
JER.49.23	like a wild sea in a raging storm.
JER.49.24	Damascus has become feeble,
JER.49.24	and all her people turn to flee.
JER.49.24	Fear, anguish, and pain have gripped her
JER.49.24	as they grip a woman in labor.
JER.49.25	That famous city, a city of joy,
JER.49.25	will be forsaken!
JER.49.26	Her young men will fall in the streets and die.
JER.49.26	Her soldiers will all be killed,”
JER.49.26	says the 
JER.49.27	“And I will set fire to the walls of Damascus
JER.49.27	that will burn up the palaces of Ben-hadad.”
JER.49.28	This message was given concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which were attacked by King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.49.28	“Advance against Kedar!
JER.49.28	Destroy the warriors from the East!
JER.49.29	Their flocks and tents will be captured,
JER.49.29	and their household goods and camels will be taken away.
JER.49.29	Everywhere shouts of panic will be heard:
JER.49.29	‘We are terrorized at every turn!’
JER.49.30	Run for your lives,” says the 
JER.49.30	“Hide yourselves in deep caves, you people of Hazor,
JER.49.30	for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has plotted against you
JER.49.30	and is preparing to destroy you.
JER.49.31	“Go up and attack that complacent nation,”
JER.49.31	says the 
JER.49.31	“Its people live alone in the desert
JER.49.31	without walls or gates.
JER.49.32	Their camels and other livestock will all be yours.
JER.49.32	I will scatter to the winds these people
JER.49.32	who live in remote places.
JER.49.32	I will bring calamity upon them
JER.49.32	from every direction,” says the 
JER.49.33	“Hazor will be inhabited by jackals,
JER.49.33	and it will be desolate forever.
JER.49.33	No one will live there;
JER.49.33	no one will inhabit it.”
JER.49.34	This message concerning Elam came to the prophet Jeremiah from the 
JER.49.35	This is what the 
JER.49.35	“I will destroy the archers of Elam—
JER.49.35	the best of their forces.
JER.49.36	I will bring enemies from all directions,
JER.49.36	and I will scatter the people of Elam to the four winds.
JER.49.36	They will be exiled to countries around the world.
JER.49.37	I myself will go with Elam’s enemies to shatter it.
JER.49.37	In my fierce anger, I will bring great disaster
JER.49.37	upon the people of Elam,” says the 
JER.49.37	“Their enemies will chase them with the sword
JER.49.37	until I have destroyed them completely.
JER.49.38	I will set my throne in Elam,” says the 
JER.49.38	“and I will destroy its king and officials.
JER.49.39	But I will restore the fortunes of Elam
JER.49.39	in days to come.
JER.49.39	I, the 
JER.50.1	The 
JER.50.2	This is what the 
JER.50.2	“Tell the whole world,
JER.50.2	and keep nothing back.
JER.50.2	Raise a signal flag
JER.50.2	to tell everyone that Babylon will fall!
JER.50.2	Her images and idols
JER.50.2	Her gods Bel and Marduk will be utterly disgraced.
JER.50.3	For a nation will attack her from the north
JER.50.3	and bring such destruction that no one will live there again.
JER.50.3	Everything will be gone;
JER.50.3	both people and animals will flee.
JER.50.4	“In those coming days,”
JER.50.4	says the 
JER.50.4	“the people of Israel will return home
JER.50.4	together with the people of Judah.
JER.50.4	They will come weeping
JER.50.4	and seeking the 
JER.50.5	They will ask the way to Jerusalem
JER.50.5	and will start back home again.
JER.50.5	They will bind themselves to the 
JER.50.5	with an eternal covenant that will never be forgotten.
JER.50.6	“My people have been lost sheep.
JER.50.6	Their shepherds have led them astray
JER.50.6	and turned them loose in the mountains.
JER.50.6	They have lost their way
JER.50.6	and can’t remember how to get back to the sheepfold.
JER.50.7	All who found them devoured them.
JER.50.7	Their enemies said,
JER.50.7	‘We did nothing wrong in attacking them,
JER.50.7	for they sinned against the 
JER.50.7	their true place of rest,
JER.50.7	and the hope of their ancestors.’
JER.50.8	“But now, flee from Babylon!
JER.50.8	Leave the land of the Babylonians.
JER.50.8	Like male goats at the head of the flock,
JER.50.8	lead my people home again.
JER.50.9	For I am raising up an army
JER.50.9	of great nations from the north.
JER.50.9	They will join forces to attack Babylon,
JER.50.9	and she will be captured.
JER.50.9	The enemies’ arrows will go straight to the mark;
JER.50.9	they will not miss!
JER.50.10	Babylonia
JER.50.10	until the attackers are glutted with loot.
JER.50.10	I, the 
JER.50.11	“You rejoice and are glad,
JER.50.11	you who plundered my chosen people.
JER.50.11	You frisk about like a calf in a meadow
JER.50.11	and neigh like a stallion.
JER.50.12	But your homeland
JER.50.12	with shame and disgrace.
JER.50.12	You will become the least of nations—
JER.50.12	a wilderness, a dry and desolate land.
JER.50.13	Because of the 
JER.50.13	Babylon will become a deserted wasteland.
JER.50.13	All who pass by will be horrified
JER.50.13	and will gasp at the destruction they see there.
JER.50.14	“Yes, prepare to attack Babylon,
JER.50.14	all you surrounding nations.
JER.50.14	Let your archers shoot at her; spare no arrows.
JER.50.14	For she has sinned against the 
JER.50.15	Shout war cries against her from every side.
JER.50.15	Look! She surrenders!
JER.50.15	Her walls have fallen.
JER.50.15	It is the 
JER.50.15	so take vengeance on her.
JER.50.15	Do to her as she has done to others!
JER.50.16	Take from Babylon all those who plant crops;
JER.50.16	send all the harvesters away.
JER.50.16	Because of the sword of the enemy,
JER.50.16	everyone will run away and rush back to their own lands.
JER.50.17	“The Israelites are like sheep
JER.50.17	that have been scattered by lions.
JER.50.17	First the king of Assyria ate them up.
JER.50.17	Then King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.50.18	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.50.18	the God of Israel, says:
JER.50.18	“Now I will punish the king of Babylon and his land,
JER.50.18	just as I punished the king of Assyria.
JER.50.19	And I will bring Israel home again to its own land,
JER.50.19	to feed in the fields of Carmel and Bashan,
JER.50.19	and to be satisfied once more
JER.50.19	in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead.
JER.50.20	In those days,” says the 
JER.50.20	“no sin will be found in Israel or in Judah,
JER.50.20	for I will forgive the remnant I preserve.
JER.50.21	“Go up, my warriors, against the land of Merathaim
JER.50.21	and against the people of Pekod.
JER.50.21	Pursue, kill, and completely destroy
JER.50.21	as I have commanded you,” says the 
JER.50.22	“Let the battle cry be heard in the land,
JER.50.22	a shout of great destruction.
JER.50.23	Babylon, the mightiest hammer in all the earth,
JER.50.23	lies broken and shattered.
JER.50.23	Babylon is desolate among the nations!
JER.50.24	Listen, Babylon, for I have set a trap for you.
JER.50.24	You are caught, for you have fought against the 
JER.50.25	The 
JER.50.25	and brought out weapons to vent his fury.
JER.50.25	The terror that falls upon the Babylonians
JER.50.25	will be the work of the Sovereign 
JER.50.26	Yes, come against her from distant lands.
JER.50.26	Break open her granaries.
JER.50.26	Crush her walls and houses into heaps of rubble.
JER.50.26	Destroy her completely, and leave nothing!
JER.50.27	Destroy even her young bulls—
JER.50.27	it will be terrible for them, too!
JER.50.27	Slaughter them all!
JER.50.27	For Babylon’s day of reckoning has come.
JER.50.28	Listen to the people who have escaped from Babylon,
JER.50.28	as they tell in Jerusalem
JER.50.28	how the 
JER.50.28	against those who destroyed his Temple.
JER.50.29	“Send out a call for archers to come to Babylon.
JER.50.29	Surround the city so none can escape.
JER.50.29	Do to her as she has done to others,
JER.50.29	for she has defied the 
JER.50.30	Her young men will fall in the streets and die.
JER.50.30	Her soldiers will all be killed,”
JER.50.30	says the 
JER.50.31	“See, I am your enemy, you arrogant people,”
JER.50.31	says the Lord, the 
JER.50.31	“Your day of reckoning has arrived—
JER.50.31	the day when I will punish you.
JER.50.32	O land of arrogance, you will stumble and fall,
JER.50.32	and no one will raise you up.
JER.50.32	For I will light a fire in the cities of Babylon
JER.50.32	that will burn up everything around them.”
JER.50.33	This is what the 
JER.50.33	“The people of Israel and Judah have been wronged.
JER.50.33	Their captors hold them and refuse to let them go.
JER.50.34	But the one who redeems them is strong.
JER.50.34	His name is the 
JER.50.34	He will defend them
JER.50.34	and give them rest again in Israel.
JER.50.34	But for the people of Babylon
JER.50.34	there will be no rest!
JER.50.35	“The sword of destruction will strike the Babylonians,”
JER.50.35	says the 
JER.50.35	“It will strike the people of Babylon—
JER.50.35	her officials and wise men, too.
JER.50.36	The sword will strike her wise counselors,
JER.50.36	and they will become fools.
JER.50.36	The sword will strike her mightiest warriors,
JER.50.36	and panic will seize them.
JER.50.37	The sword will strike her horses and chariots
JER.50.37	and her allies from other lands,
JER.50.37	and they will all become like women.
JER.50.37	The sword will strike her treasures,
JER.50.37	and they all will be plundered.
JER.50.38	A drought
JER.50.38	causing it to dry up.
JER.50.38	And why? Because the whole land is filled with idols,
JER.50.38	and the people are madly in love with them.
JER.50.39	“Soon Babylon will be inhabited by desert animals and hyenas.
JER.50.39	It will be a home for owls.
JER.50.39	Never again will people live there;
JER.50.39	it will lie desolate forever.
JER.50.40	I will destroy it as I
JER.50.40	and their neighboring towns,” says the 
JER.50.40	“No one will live there;
JER.50.40	no one will inhabit it.
JER.50.41	“Look! A great army is coming from the north.
JER.50.41	A great nation and many kings
JER.50.41	are rising against you from far-off lands.
JER.50.42	They are armed with bows and spears.
JER.50.42	They are cruel and show no mercy.
JER.50.42	As they ride forward on horses,
JER.50.42	they sound like a roaring sea.
JER.50.42	They are coming in battle formation,
JER.50.42	planning to destroy you, Babylon.
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon has heard reports about the enemy,
JER.50.43	and he is weak with fright.
JER.50.43	Pangs of anguish have gripped him,
JER.50.43	like those of a woman in labor.
JER.50.44	“I will come like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan,
JER.50.44	leaping on the sheep in the pasture.
JER.50.44	I will chase Babylon from its land,
JER.50.44	and I will appoint the leader of my choice.
JER.50.44	For who is like me, and who can challenge me?
JER.50.44	What ruler can oppose my will?”
JER.50.45	Listen to the 
JER.50.45	and the land of the Babylonians.
JER.50.45	Even the little children will be dragged off like sheep,
JER.50.45	and their homes will be destroyed.
JER.50.46	The earth will shake with the shout, “Babylon has been taken!”
JER.50.46	and its cry of despair will be heard around the world.
JER.51.1	This is what the 
JER.51.1	“I will stir up a destroyer against Babylon
JER.51.1	and the people of Babylonia.
JER.51.2	Foreigners will come and winnow her,
JER.51.2	blowing her away as chaff.
JER.51.2	They will come from every side
JER.51.2	to rise against her in her day of trouble.
JER.51.3	Don’t let the archers put on their armor
JER.51.3	or draw their bows.
JER.51.3	Don’t spare even her best soldiers!
JER.51.3	Let her army be completely destroyed.
JER.51.4	They will fall dead in the land of the Babylonians,
JER.51.4	slashed to death in her streets.
JER.51.5	For the 
JER.51.5	has not abandoned Israel and Judah.
JER.51.5	He is still their God,
JER.51.5	even though their land was filled with sin
JER.51.5	against the Holy One of Israel.”
JER.51.6	Flee from Babylon! Save yourselves!
JER.51.6	Don’t get trapped in her punishment!
JER.51.6	It is the 
JER.51.6	he will repay her in full.
JER.51.7	Babylon has been a gold cup in the 
JER.51.7	a cup that made the whole earth drunk.
JER.51.7	The nations drank Babylon’s wine,
JER.51.7	and it drove them all mad.
JER.51.8	But suddenly Babylon, too, has fallen.
JER.51.8	Weep for her.
JER.51.8	Give her medicine.
JER.51.8	Perhaps she can yet be healed.
JER.51.9	We would have helped her if we could,
JER.51.9	but nothing can save her now.
JER.51.9	Let her go; abandon her.
JER.51.9	Return now to your own land.
JER.51.9	For her punishment reaches to the heavens;
JER.51.9	it is so great it cannot be measured.
JER.51.10	The 
JER.51.10	Come, let us announce in Jerusalem
JER.51.10	everything the

JER.51.11	Lift up the shields!
JER.51.11	For the 
JER.51.11	to march against Babylon and destroy her.
JER.51.11	This is his vengeance against those
JER.51.11	who desecrated his Temple.
JER.51.12	Raise the battle flag against Babylon!
JER.51.12	Reinforce the guard and station the watchmen.
JER.51.12	Prepare an ambush,
JER.51.12	for the 
JER.51.13	You are a city by a great river,

JER.51.15	The 
JER.51.15	and he preserves it by his wisdom.
JER.51.15	With his own understanding
JER.51.15	he stretched out the heavens.
JER.51.16	When he speaks in the thunder,
JER.51.16	the heavens roar with rain.
JER.51.16	He causes the clouds to rise over the earth.
JER.51.16	He sends the lightning with the rain
JER.51.16	and releases the wind from his storehouses.
JER.51.17	The whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge!
JER.51.17	The craftsmen are disgraced by the idols they make,
JER.51.17	for their carefully shaped works are a fraud.
JER.51.17	These idols have no breath or power.
JER.51.18	Idols are worthless; they are ridiculous lies!
JER.51.18	On the day of reckoning they will all be destroyed.
JER.51.19	But the God of Israel
JER.51.19	He is the Creator of everything that exists,
JER.51.19	including his people, his own special possession.
JER.51.19	The 
JER.51.20	“You

JER.51.21	destroying the horse and rider,

JER.51.22	With you I will shatter men and women,
JER.51.22	old people and children,
JER.51.22	young men and young women.
JER.51.23	With you I will shatter shepherds and flocks,
JER.51.23	farmers and oxen,

JER.51.24	to my people in Jerusalem,” says the 
JER.51.25	“Look, O mighty mountain, destroyer of the earth!
JER.51.25	I am your enemy,” says the 
JER.51.25	“I will raise my fist against you,
JER.51.25	to knock you down from the heights.
JER.51.25	When I am finished,
JER.51.25	you will be nothing but a heap of burnt rubble.
JER.51.26	You will be desolate forever.
JER.51.26	Even your stones will never again be used for building.
JER.51.26	You will be completely wiped out,”
JER.51.26	says the 
JER.51.27	Raise a signal flag to the nations.
JER.51.27	Sound the battle cry!
JER.51.27	Mobilize them all against Babylon.
JER.51.27	Prepare them to fight against her!
JER.51.27	Bring out the armies of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.
JER.51.27	Appoint a commander,
JER.51.27	and bring a multitude of horses like swarming locusts!
JER.51.28	Bring against her the armies of the nations—
JER.51.28	led by the kings of the Medes
JER.51.28	and all their captains and officers.
JER.51.29	The earth trembles and writhes in pain,
JER.51.29	for everything the 
JER.51.29	Babylon will be left desolate without a single inhabitant.
JER.51.30	Her mightiest warriors no longer fight.
JER.51.30	They stay in their barracks, their courage gone.
JER.51.30	They have become like women.
JER.51.30	The invaders have burned the houses
JER.51.30	and broken down the city gates.
JER.51.31	The news is passed from one runner to the next
JER.51.31	as the messengers hurry to tell the king
JER.51.31	that his city has been captured.
JER.51.32	All the escape routes are blocked.
JER.51.32	The marshes have been set aflame,
JER.51.32	and the army is in a panic.
JER.51.33	This is what the 
JER.51.33	the God of Israel, says:
JER.51.33	“Babylon is like wheat on a threshing floor,
JER.51.33	about to be trampled.
JER.51.33	In just a little while
JER.51.33	her harvest will begin.”
JER.51.34	“King Nebuchadnezzar
JER.51.34	and drained us of strength.
JER.51.34	He has swallowed us like a great monster
JER.51.34	and filled his belly with our riches.
JER.51.34	He has thrown us out of our own country.
JER.51.35	Make Babylon suffer as she made us suffer,”
JER.51.35	say the people of Zion.
JER.51.35	“Make the people of Babylonia pay for spilling our blood,”
JER.51.35	says Jerusalem.
JER.51.36	This is what the 
JER.51.36	“I will be your lawyer to plead your case,
JER.51.36	and I will avenge you.
JER.51.36	I will dry up her river,
JER.51.36	as well as her springs,
JER.51.37	and Babylon will become a heap of ruins,
JER.51.37	haunted by jackals.
JER.51.37	She will be an object of horror and contempt,
JER.51.37	a place where no one lives.
JER.51.38	Her people will roar together like strong lions.
JER.51.38	They will growl like lion cubs.
JER.51.39	And while they lie inflamed with all their wine,
JER.51.39	I will prepare a different kind of feast for them.
JER.51.39	I will make them drink until they fall asleep,
JER.51.39	and they will never wake up again,”
JER.51.39	says the 
JER.51.40	“I will bring them down
JER.51.40	like lambs to the slaughter,
JER.51.40	like rams and goats to be sacrificed.
JER.51.41	“How Babylon
JER.51.41	great Babylon, praised throughout the earth!
JER.51.41	Now she has become an object of horror
JER.51.41	among the nations.
JER.51.42	The sea has risen over Babylon;
JER.51.42	she is covered by its crashing waves.
JER.51.43	Her cities now lie in ruins;
JER.51.43	she is a dry wasteland
JER.51.43	where no one lives or even passes by.
JER.51.44	And I will punish Bel, the god of Babylon,
JER.51.44	and make him vomit up all he has eaten.
JER.51.44	The nations will no longer come and worship him.
JER.51.44	The wall of Babylon has fallen!
JER.51.45	“Come out, my people, flee from Babylon.
JER.51.45	Save yourselves! Run from the 
JER.51.46	But do not panic; don’t be afraid
JER.51.46	when you hear the first rumor of approaching forces.
JER.51.46	For rumors will keep coming year by year.
JER.51.46	Violence will erupt in the land
JER.51.46	as the leaders fight against each other.
JER.51.47	For the time is surely coming
JER.51.47	when I will punish this great city and all her idols.
JER.51.47	Her whole land will be disgraced,
JER.51.47	and her dead will lie in the streets.
JER.51.48	Then the heavens and earth will rejoice,
JER.51.48	for out of the north will come destroying armies
JER.51.48	against Babylon,” says the 
JER.51.49	“Just as Babylon killed the people of Israel
JER.51.49	and others throughout the world,
JER.51.49	so must her people be killed.
JER.51.50	Get out, all you who have escaped the sword!
JER.51.50	Do not stand and watch—flee while you can!
JER.51.50	Remember the 
JER.51.50	and think about your home in Jerusalem.”
JER.51.51	“We are ashamed,” the people say.
JER.51.51	“We are insulted and disgraced
JER.51.51	because the 
JER.51.51	has been defiled by foreigners.”
JER.51.52	“Yes,” says the 
JER.51.52	when I will destroy Babylon’s idols.
JER.51.52	The groans of her wounded people
JER.51.52	will be heard throughout the land.
JER.51.53	Though Babylon reaches as high as the heavens
JER.51.53	and makes her fortifications incredibly strong,
JER.51.53	I will still send enemies to plunder her.
JER.51.53	I, the 
JER.51.54	“Listen! Hear the cry of Babylon,
JER.51.54	the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians.
JER.51.55	For the 
JER.51.55	He will silence her loud voice.
JER.51.55	Waves of enemies pound against her;
JER.51.55	the noise of battle rings through the city.
JER.51.56	Destroying armies come against Babylon.
JER.51.56	Her mighty men are captured,
JER.51.56	and their weapons break in their hands.
JER.51.56	For the 
JER.51.56	he always repays in full.
JER.51.57	I will make her officials and wise men drunk,
JER.51.57	along with her captains, officers, and warriors.
JER.51.57	They will fall asleep
JER.51.57	and never wake up again!”
JER.51.57	says the King, whose name is
JER.51.57	the 
JER.51.58	This is what the 
JER.51.58	“The thick walls of Babylon will be leveled to the ground,
JER.51.58	and her massive gates will be burned.
JER.51.58	The builders from many lands have worked in vain,
JER.51.58	for their work will be destroyed by fire!”
JER.51.59	The prophet Jeremiah gave this message to Seraiah son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah, a staff officer, when Seraiah went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah. This was during the fourth year of Zedekiah’s reign.
JER.51.60	Jeremiah had recorded on a scroll all the terrible disasters that would soon come upon Babylon—all the words written here. 
JER.51.61	He said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, read aloud everything on this scroll. 
JER.51.62	Then say, ‘
JER.51.63	When you have finished reading the scroll, tie it to a stone and throw it into the Euphrates River. 
JER.51.64	Then say, ‘In this same way Babylon and her people will sink, never again to rise, because of the disasters I will bring upon her.’”
JER.51.64	This is the end of Jeremiah’s messages.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 
JER.52.2	But Zedekiah did what was evil in the 
JER.52.3	These things happened because of the 
JER.52.3	Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
JER.52.4	So on January 15,
JER.52.5	Jerusalem was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah’s reign.
JER.52.6	By July 18 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah’s reign,
JER.52.7	Then a section of the city wall was broken down, and all the soldiers fled. Since the city was surrounded by the Babylonians,
JER.52.8	But the Babylonian troops chased King Zedekiah and overtook him on the plains of Jericho, for his men had all deserted him and scattered. 
JER.52.9	They captured the king and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath. There the king of Babylon pronounced judgment upon Zedekiah. 
JER.52.10	The king of Babylon made Zedekiah watch as he slaughtered his sons. He also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah. 
JER.52.11	Then he gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in bronze chains, and the king of Babylon led him away to Babylon. Zedekiah remained there in prison until the day of his death.
JER.52.12	On August 17 of that year,
JER.52.13	He burned down the Temple of the 
JER.52.14	Then he supervised the entire Babylonian
JER.52.15	Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took as exiles some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, the defectors who had declared their allegiance to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen. 
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind to care for the vineyards and fields.
JER.52.17	The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars in front of the 
JER.52.18	They also took all the ash buckets, shovels, lamp snuffers, basins, dishes, and all the other bronze articles used for making sacrifices at the Temple. 
JER.52.19	The captain of the guard also took the small bowls, incense burners, basins, pots, lampstands, ladles, bowls used for liquid offerings, and all the other articles made of pure gold or silver.
JER.52.20	The weight of the bronze from the two pillars, the Sea with the twelve bronze oxen beneath it, and the water carts was too great to be measured. These things had been made for the 
JER.52.21	Each of the pillars was 27 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference.
JER.52.22	The bronze capital on top of each pillar was 7
JER.52.23	There were 96 pomegranates on the sides, and a total of 100 pomegranates on the network around the top.
JER.52.24	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took with him as prisoners Seraiah the high priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three chief gatekeepers. 
JER.52.25	And from among the people still hiding in the city, he took an officer who had been in charge of the Judean army; seven of the king’s personal advisers; the army commander’s chief secretary, who was in charge of recruitment; and sixty other citizens. 
JER.52.26	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them all to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
JER.52.27	And there at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon had them all put to death. So the people of Judah were sent into exile from their land.

JER.52.32	He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a higher place than all the other exiled kings in Babylon. 
JER.52.33	He supplied Jehoiachin with new clothes to replace his prison garb and allowed him to dine in the king’s presence for the rest of his life. 
JER.52.34	So the Babylonian king gave him a regular food allowance as long as he lived. This continued until the day of his death.
LAM.1.1	Jerusalem, once so full of people,
LAM.1.1	is now deserted.
LAM.1.1	She who was once great among the nations
LAM.1.1	now sits alone like a widow.
LAM.1.1	Once the queen of all the earth,
LAM.1.1	she is now a slave.
LAM.1.2	She sobs through the night;
LAM.1.2	tears stream down her cheeks.
LAM.1.2	Among all her lovers,
LAM.1.2	there is no one left to comfort her.
LAM.1.2	All her friends have betrayed her
LAM.1.2	and become her enemies.
LAM.1.3	Judah has been led away into captivity,
LAM.1.3	oppressed with cruel slavery.
LAM.1.3	She lives among foreign nations
LAM.1.3	and has no place of rest.
LAM.1.3	Her enemies have chased her down,
LAM.1.3	and she has nowhere to turn.
LAM.1.4	The roads to Jerusalem

LAM.1.4	The city gates are silent,
LAM.1.4	her priests groan,
LAM.1.4	her young women are crying—
LAM.1.4	how bitter is her fate!
LAM.1.5	Her oppressors have become her masters,
LAM.1.5	and her enemies prosper,
LAM.1.5	for the 
LAM.1.5	for her many sins.
LAM.1.5	Her children have been captured
LAM.1.5	and taken away to distant lands.
LAM.1.6	All the majesty of beautiful Jerusalem
LAM.1.6	has been stripped away.
LAM.1.6	Her princes are like starving deer
LAM.1.6	searching for pasture.
LAM.1.6	They are too weak to run
LAM.1.6	from the pursuing enemy.
LAM.1.7	In the midst of her sadness and wandering,
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembers her ancient splendor.
LAM.1.7	But now she has fallen to her enemy,
LAM.1.7	and there is no one to help her.
LAM.1.7	Her enemy struck her down
LAM.1.7	and laughed as she fell.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem has sinned greatly,
LAM.1.8	so she has been tossed away like a filthy rag.
LAM.1.8	All who once honored her now despise her,
LAM.1.8	for they have seen her stripped naked and humiliated.
LAM.1.8	All she can do is groan
LAM.1.8	and hide her face.
LAM.1.9	She defiled herself with immorality
LAM.1.9	and gave no thought to her future.
LAM.1.9	Now she lies in the gutter
LAM.1.9	with no one to lift her out.

LAM.1.9	“The enemy has triumphed.”
LAM.1.10	The enemy has plundered her completely,
LAM.1.10	taking every precious thing she owns.
LAM.1.10	She has seen foreigners violate her sacred Temple,
LAM.1.10	the place the 
LAM.1.11	Her people groan as they search for bread.
LAM.1.11	They have sold their treasures for food to stay alive.

LAM.1.13	He has placed a trap in my path and turned me back.
LAM.1.13	He has left me devastated,
LAM.1.13	racked with sickness all day long.
LAM.1.14	“He wove my sins into ropes
LAM.1.14	to hitch me to a yoke of captivity.
LAM.1.14	The Lord sapped my strength and turned me over to my enemies;
LAM.1.14	I am helpless in their hands.
LAM.1.15	“The Lord has treated my mighty men
LAM.1.15	with contempt.
LAM.1.15	At his command a great army has come
LAM.1.15	to crush my young warriors.
LAM.1.15	The Lord has trampled his beloved city
LAM.1.15	like grapes are trampled in a winepress.

LAM.1.16	tears flow down my cheeks.
LAM.1.16	No one is here to comfort me;
LAM.1.16	any who might encourage me are far away.
LAM.1.16	My children have no future,

LAM.1.17	Jerusalem reaches out for help,
LAM.1.17	but no one comforts her.
LAM.1.17	Regarding his people Israel,

LAM.1.19	“I begged my allies for help,

LAM.1.19	My priests and leaders
LAM.1.19	starved to death in the city,

LAM.1.19	to save their lives.

LAM.1.20	My heart is broken
LAM.1.20	and my soul despairs,
LAM.1.20	for I have rebelled against you.
LAM.1.20	In the streets the sword kills,

LAM.1.22	My groans are many,
LAM.1.22	and I am sick at heart.”
LAM.2.1	The Lord in his anger
LAM.2.1	has cast a dark shadow over beautiful Jerusalem.
LAM.2.1	The fairest of Israel’s cities lies in the dust,
LAM.2.1	thrown down from the heights of heaven.
LAM.2.1	In his day of great anger,
LAM.2.1	the Lord has shown no mercy even to his Temple.
LAM.2.2	Without mercy the Lord has destroyed
LAM.2.2	every home in Israel.
LAM.2.2	In his anger he has broken down
LAM.2.2	the fortress walls of beautiful Jerusalem.
LAM.2.2	He has brought them to the ground,
LAM.2.2	dishonoring the kingdom and its rulers.
LAM.2.3	All the strength of Israel
LAM.2.3	vanishes beneath his fierce anger.
LAM.2.3	The Lord has withdrawn his protection
LAM.2.3	as the enemy attacks.
LAM.2.3	He consumes the whole land of Israel
LAM.2.3	like a raging fire.
LAM.2.4	He bends his bow against his people,
LAM.2.4	as though he were their enemy.
LAM.2.4	His strength is used against them
LAM.2.4	to kill their finest youth.
LAM.2.4	His fury is poured out like fire
LAM.2.4	on beautiful Jerusalem.
LAM.2.5	Yes, the Lord has vanquished Israel
LAM.2.5	like an enemy.
LAM.2.5	He has destroyed her palaces
LAM.2.5	and demolished her fortresses.
LAM.2.5	He has brought unending sorrow and tears
LAM.2.5	upon beautiful Jerusalem.
LAM.2.6	He has broken down his Temple
LAM.2.6	as though it were merely a garden shelter.
LAM.2.6	The 
LAM.2.6	of the holy festivals and Sabbath days.
LAM.2.6	Kings and priests fall together
LAM.2.6	before his fierce anger.
LAM.2.7	The Lord has rejected his own altar;
LAM.2.7	he despises his own sanctuary.
LAM.2.7	He has given Jerusalem’s palaces
LAM.2.7	to her enemies.
LAM.2.7	They shout in the 
LAM.2.7	as though it were a day of celebration.
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.8	to destroy the walls of beautiful Jerusalem.
LAM.2.8	He made careful plans for their destruction,
LAM.2.8	then did what he had planned.
LAM.2.8	Therefore, the ramparts and walls
LAM.2.8	have fallen down before him.
LAM.2.9	Jerusalem’s gates have sunk into the ground.
LAM.2.9	He has smashed their locks and bars.
LAM.2.9	Her kings and princes have been exiled to distant lands;
LAM.2.9	her law has ceased to exist.
LAM.2.9	Her prophets receive
LAM.2.9	no more visions from the 
LAM.2.10	The leaders of beautiful Jerusalem
LAM.2.10	sit on the ground in silence.
LAM.2.10	They are clothed in burlap
LAM.2.10	and throw dust on their heads.
LAM.2.10	The young women of Jerusalem
LAM.2.10	hang their heads in shame.
LAM.2.11	I have cried until the tears no longer come;
LAM.2.11	my heart is broken.
LAM.2.11	My spirit is poured out in agony
LAM.2.11	as I see the desperate plight of my people.
LAM.2.11	Little children and tiny babies
LAM.2.11	are fainting and dying in the streets.
LAM.2.12	They cry out to their mothers,
LAM.2.12	“We need food and drink!”
LAM.2.12	Their lives ebb away in the streets
LAM.2.12	like the life of a warrior wounded in battle.
LAM.2.12	They gasp for life
LAM.2.12	as they collapse in their mothers’ arms.
LAM.2.13	What can I say about you?
LAM.2.13	Who has ever seen such sorrow?
LAM.2.13	O daughter of Jerusalem,
LAM.2.13	to what can I compare your anguish?
LAM.2.13	O virgin daughter of Zion,
LAM.2.13	how can I comfort you?
LAM.2.13	For your wound is as deep as the sea.
LAM.2.13	Who can heal you?
LAM.2.14	Your prophets have said
LAM.2.14	so many foolish things, false to the core.
LAM.2.14	They did not save you from exile
LAM.2.14	by pointing out your sins.
LAM.2.14	Instead, they painted false pictures,
LAM.2.14	filling you with false hope.
LAM.2.15	All who pass by jeer at you.
LAM.2.15	They scoff and insult beautiful Jerusalem,
LAM.2.15	“Is this the city called ‘Most Beautiful in All the World’
LAM.2.15	and ‘Joy of All the Earth’?”
LAM.2.16	All your enemies mock you.
LAM.2.16	They scoff and snarl and say,
LAM.2.16	“We have destroyed her at last!
LAM.2.16	We have long waited for this day,
LAM.2.16	and it is finally here!”
LAM.2.17	But it is the 
LAM.2.17	He has fulfilled the promises of disaster
LAM.2.17	he made long ago.
LAM.2.17	He has destroyed Jerusalem without mercy.
LAM.2.17	He has caused her enemies to gloat over her
LAM.2.17	and has given them power over her.
LAM.2.18	Cry aloud
LAM.2.18	O walls of beautiful Jerusalem!
LAM.2.18	Let your tears flow like a river
LAM.2.18	day and night.
LAM.2.18	Give yourselves no rest;
LAM.2.18	give your eyes no relief.
LAM.2.19	Rise during the night and cry out.
LAM.2.19	Pour out your hearts like water to the Lord.
LAM.2.19	Lift up your hands to him in prayer,
LAM.2.19	pleading for your children,
LAM.2.19	for in every street
LAM.2.19	they are faint with hunger.
LAM.2.20	“O 
LAM.2.20	Should you treat your own people this way?
LAM.2.20	Should mothers eat their own children,
LAM.2.20	those they once bounced on their knees?
LAM.2.20	Should priests and prophets be killed
LAM.2.20	within the Lord’s Temple?
LAM.2.21	“See them lying in the streets—
LAM.2.21	young and old,
LAM.2.21	boys and girls,
LAM.2.21	killed by the swords of the enemy.
LAM.2.21	You have killed them in your anger,
LAM.2.21	slaughtering them without mercy.
LAM.2.22	“You have invited terrors from all around,
LAM.2.22	as though you were calling them to a day of feasting.
LAM.2.22	In the day of the 
LAM.2.22	no one has escaped or survived.
LAM.2.22	The enemy has killed all the children
LAM.2.22	whom I carried and raised.”
LAM.3.1	I am the one who has seen the afflictions
LAM.3.1	that come from the rod of the 
LAM.3.2	He has led me into darkness,
LAM.3.2	shutting out all light.
LAM.3.3	He has turned his hand against me
LAM.3.3	again and again, all day long.
LAM.3.4	He has made my skin and flesh grow old.
LAM.3.4	He has broken my bones.
LAM.3.5	He has besieged and surrounded me
LAM.3.5	with anguish and distress.
LAM.3.6	He has buried me in a dark place,
LAM.3.6	like those long dead.
LAM.3.7	He has walled me in, and I cannot escape.
LAM.3.7	He has bound me in heavy chains.
LAM.3.8	And though I cry and shout,
LAM.3.8	he has shut out my prayers.
LAM.3.9	He has blocked my way with a high stone wall;
LAM.3.9	he has made my road crooked.
LAM.3.10	He has hidden like a bear or a lion,
LAM.3.10	waiting to attack me.
LAM.3.11	He has dragged me off the path and torn me in pieces,
LAM.3.11	leaving me helpless and devastated.
LAM.3.12	He has drawn his bow
LAM.3.12	and made me the target for his arrows.
LAM.3.13	He shot his arrows
LAM.3.13	deep into my heart.
LAM.3.14	My own people laugh at me.
LAM.3.14	All day long they sing their mocking songs.
LAM.3.15	He has filled me with bitterness
LAM.3.15	and given me a bitter cup of sorrow to drink.
LAM.3.16	He has made me chew on gravel.
LAM.3.16	He has rolled me in the dust.
LAM.3.17	Peace has been stripped away,
LAM.3.17	and I have forgotten what prosperity is.
LAM.3.18	I cry out, “My splendor is gone!
LAM.3.18	Everything I had hoped for from the 
LAM.3.19	The thought of my suffering and homelessness
LAM.3.19	is bitter beyond words.
LAM.3.20	I will never forget this awful time,
LAM.3.20	as I grieve over my loss.
LAM.3.21	Yet I still dare to hope
LAM.3.21	when I remember this:
LAM.3.22	The faithful love of the 
LAM.3.22	His mercies never cease.
LAM.3.23	Great is his faithfulness;
LAM.3.23	his mercies begin afresh each morning.
LAM.3.24	I say to myself, “The 
LAM.3.24	therefore, I will hope in him!”
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.25	to those who search for him.
LAM.3.26	So it is good to wait quietly
LAM.3.26	for salvation from the 
LAM.3.27	And it is good for people to submit at an early age
LAM.3.27	to the yoke of his discipline:
LAM.3.28	Let them sit alone in silence
LAM.3.28	beneath the 
LAM.3.29	Let them lie face down in the dust,
LAM.3.29	for there may be hope at last.
LAM.3.30	Let them turn the other cheek to those who strike them
LAM.3.30	and accept the insults of their enemies.
LAM.3.31	For no one is abandoned
LAM.3.31	by the Lord forever.
LAM.3.32	Though he brings grief, he also shows compassion
LAM.3.32	because of the greatness of his unfailing love.
LAM.3.33	For he does not enjoy hurting people
LAM.3.33	or causing them sorrow.
LAM.3.34	If people crush underfoot
LAM.3.34	all the prisoners of the land,
LAM.3.35	if they deprive others of their rights
LAM.3.35	in defiance of the Most High,
LAM.3.36	if they twist justice in the courts—
LAM.3.36	doesn’t the Lord see all these things?
LAM.3.37	Who can command things to happen
LAM.3.37	without the Lord’s permission?
LAM.3.38	Does not the Most High
LAM.3.38	send both calamity and good?
LAM.3.39	Then why should we, mere humans, complain
LAM.3.39	when we are punished for our sins?
LAM.3.40	Instead, let us test and examine our ways.
LAM.3.40	Let us turn back to the 
LAM.3.41	Let us lift our hearts and hands
LAM.3.41	to God in heaven and say,
LAM.3.42	“We have sinned and rebelled,
LAM.3.42	and you have not forgiven us.
LAM.3.43	“You have engulfed us with your anger, chased us down,
LAM.3.43	and slaughtered us without mercy.
LAM.3.44	You have hidden yourself in a cloud
LAM.3.44	so our prayers cannot reach you.
LAM.3.45	You have discarded us as refuse and garbage
LAM.3.45	among the nations.
LAM.3.46	“All our enemies
LAM.3.46	have spoken out against us.
LAM.3.47	We are filled with fear,
LAM.3.47	for we are trapped, devastated, and ruined.”
LAM.3.48	Tears stream from my eyes
LAM.3.48	because of the destruction of my people!
LAM.3.49	My tears flow endlessly;
LAM.3.49	they will not stop
LAM.3.50	until the 
LAM.3.50	from heaven and sees.
LAM.3.51	My heart is breaking
LAM.3.51	over the fate of all the women of Jerusalem.
LAM.3.52	My enemies, whom I have never harmed,
LAM.3.52	hunted me down like a bird.
LAM.3.53	They threw me into a pit
LAM.3.53	and dropped stones on me.
LAM.3.54	The water rose over my head,
LAM.3.54	and I cried out, “This is the end!”
LAM.3.55	But I called on your name, 
LAM.3.55	from deep within the pit.
LAM.3.56	You heard me when I cried, “Listen to my pleading!
LAM.3.56	Hear my cry for help!”
LAM.3.57	Yes, you came when I called;
LAM.3.57	you told me, “Do not fear.”
LAM.3.58	Lord, you have come to my defense;
LAM.3.58	you have redeemed my life.
LAM.3.59	You have seen the wrong they have done to me, 
LAM.3.59	Be my judge, and prove me right.
LAM.3.60	You have seen the vengeful plots
LAM.3.60	my enemies have laid against me.
LAM.3.61	, you have heard the vile names they call me.
LAM.3.61	You know all about the plans they have made.
LAM.3.62	My enemies whisper and mutter
LAM.3.62	as they plot against me all day long.
LAM.3.63	Look at them! Whether they sit or stand,
LAM.3.63	I am the object of their mocking songs.
LAM.3.64	Pay them back, 
LAM.3.64	for all the evil they have done.
LAM.3.65	Give them hard and stubborn hearts,
LAM.3.65	and then let your curse fall on them!
LAM.3.66	Chase them down in your anger,
LAM.3.66	destroying them beneath the 
LAM.4.1	How the gold has lost its luster!
LAM.4.1	Even the finest gold has become dull.
LAM.4.1	The sacred gemstones
LAM.4.1	lie scattered in the streets!
LAM.4.2	See how the precious children of Jerusalem,
LAM.4.2	worth their weight in fine gold,
LAM.4.2	are now treated like pots of clay
LAM.4.2	made by a common potter.
LAM.4.3	Even the jackals feed their young,
LAM.4.3	but not my people Israel.
LAM.4.3	They ignore their children’s cries,
LAM.4.3	like ostriches in the desert.
LAM.4.4	The parched tongues of their little ones
LAM.4.4	stick to the roofs of their mouths in thirst.
LAM.4.4	The children cry for bread,
LAM.4.4	but no one has any to give them.
LAM.4.5	The people who once ate the richest foods
LAM.4.5	now beg in the streets for anything they can get.
LAM.4.5	Those who once wore the finest clothes
LAM.4.5	now search the garbage dumps for food.
LAM.4.6	The guilt
LAM.4.6	is greater than that of Sodom,
LAM.4.6	where utter disaster struck in a moment
LAM.4.6	and no hand offered help.
LAM.4.7	Our princes once glowed with health—
LAM.4.7	brighter than snow, whiter than milk.
LAM.4.7	Their faces were as ruddy as rubies,
LAM.4.7	their appearance like fine jewels.
LAM.4.8	But now their faces are blacker than soot.
LAM.4.8	No one recognizes them in the streets.
LAM.4.8	Their skin sticks to their bones;
LAM.4.8	it is as dry and hard as wood.
LAM.4.9	Those killed by the sword are better off
LAM.4.9	than those who die of hunger.
LAM.4.9	Starving, they waste away
LAM.4.9	for lack of food from the fields.
LAM.4.10	Tenderhearted women
LAM.4.10	have cooked their own children.
LAM.4.10	They have eaten them
LAM.4.10	to survive the siege.
LAM.4.11	But now the anger of the 
LAM.4.11	His fierce anger has been poured out.
LAM.4.11	He started a fire in Jerusalem
LAM.4.11	that burned the city to its foundations.
LAM.4.12	Not a king in all the earth—
LAM.4.12	no one in all the world—
LAM.4.12	would have believed that an enemy
LAM.4.12	could march through the gates of Jerusalem.
LAM.4.13	Yet it happened because of the sins of her prophets
LAM.4.13	and the sins of her priests,
LAM.4.13	who defiled the city
LAM.4.13	by shedding innocent blood.
LAM.4.14	They wandered blindly
LAM.4.14	through the streets,
LAM.4.14	so defiled by blood
LAM.4.14	that no one dared touch them.
LAM.4.15	“Get away!” the people shouted at them.
LAM.4.15	“You’re defiled! Don’t touch us!”
LAM.4.15	So they fled to distant lands
LAM.4.15	and wandered among foreign nations,
LAM.4.15	but none would let them stay.
LAM.4.16	The 
LAM.4.16	and he no longer helps them.
LAM.4.16	People show no respect for the priests
LAM.4.16	and no longer honor the leaders.
LAM.4.17	We looked in vain for our allies
LAM.4.17	to come and save us,
LAM.4.17	but we were looking to nations
LAM.4.17	that could not help us.
LAM.4.18	We couldn’t go into the streets
LAM.4.18	without danger to our lives.
LAM.4.18	Our end was near; our days were numbered.
LAM.4.18	We were doomed!
LAM.4.19	Our enemies were swifter than eagles in flight.
LAM.4.19	If we fled to the mountains, they found us.
LAM.4.19	If we hid in the wilderness,
LAM.4.19	they were waiting for us there.
LAM.4.20	Our king—the 
LAM.4.20	was caught in their snares.
LAM.4.20	We had thought that his shadow
LAM.4.20	would protect us against any nation on earth!
LAM.4.21	Are you rejoicing in the land of Uz,
LAM.4.21	O people of Edom?
LAM.4.21	But you, too, must drink from the cup of the 
LAM.4.21	You, too, will be stripped naked in your drunkenness.
LAM.4.22	O beautiful Jerusalem,
LAM.4.22	you will soon return from exile.
LAM.4.22	But Edom, your punishment is just beginning;
LAM.4.22	soon your many sins will be exposed.
LAM.5.1	, remember what has happened to us.
LAM.5.1	See how we have been disgraced!
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,

LAM.5.3	We are orphaned and fatherless.
LAM.5.3	Our mothers are widowed.
LAM.5.4	We have to pay for water to drink,
LAM.5.4	and even firewood is expensive.
LAM.5.5	Those who pursue us are at our heels;
LAM.5.5	we are exhausted but are given no rest.
LAM.5.6	We submitted to Egypt and Assyria
LAM.5.6	to get enough food to survive.
LAM.5.7	Our ancestors sinned, but they have died—
LAM.5.7	and we are suffering the punishment they deserved!
LAM.5.8	Slaves have now become our masters;

EZK.1.1	On July 31
EZK.1.2	This happened during the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity. 
EZK.1.3	(The 
EZK.1.4	As I looked, I saw a great storm coming from the north, driving before it a huge cloud that flashed with lightning and shone with brilliant light. There was fire inside the cloud, and in the middle of the fire glowed something like gleaming amber.
EZK.1.5	From the center of the cloud came four living beings that looked human, 
EZK.1.6	except that each had four faces and four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight, and their feet had hooves like those of a calf and shone like burnished bronze. 
EZK.1.8	Under each of their four wings I could see human hands. So each of the four beings had four faces and four wings. 
EZK.1.9	The wings of each living being touched the wings of the beings beside it. Each one moved straight forward in any direction without turning around.
EZK.1.10	Each had a human face in the front, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle at the back. 
EZK.1.11	Each had two pairs of outstretched wings—one pair stretched out to touch the wings of the living beings on either side of it, and the other pair covered its body. 
EZK.1.12	They went in whatever direction the spirit chose, and they moved straight forward in any direction without turning around.
EZK.1.13	The living beings looked like bright coals of fire or brilliant torches, and lightning seemed to flash back and forth among them. 
EZK.1.14	And the living beings darted to and fro like flashes of lightning.
EZK.1.15	As I looked at these beings, I saw four wheels touching the ground beside them, one wheel belonging to each. 
EZK.1.16	The wheels sparkled as if made of beryl. All four wheels looked alike and were made the same; each wheel had a second wheel turning crosswise within it. 
EZK.1.17	The beings could move in any of the four directions they faced, without turning as they moved. 
EZK.1.18	The rims of the four wheels were tall and frightening, and they were covered with eyes all around.
EZK.1.19	When the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. When they flew upward, the wheels went up, too. 
EZK.1.20	The spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. So wherever the spirit went, the wheels and the living beings also went. 
EZK.1.21	When the beings moved, the wheels moved. When the beings stopped, the wheels stopped. When the beings flew upward, the wheels rose up, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.
EZK.1.22	Spread out above them was a surface like the sky, glittering like crystal. 
EZK.1.23	Beneath this surface the wings of each living being stretched out to touch the others’ wings, and each had two wings covering its body. 
EZK.1.24	As they flew, their wings sounded to me like waves crashing against the shore or like the voice of the Almighty
EZK.1.25	As they stood with wings lowered, a voice spoke from beyond the crystal surface above them.
EZK.1.26	Above this surface was something that looked like a throne made of blue lapis lazuli. And on this throne high above was a figure whose appearance resembled a man. 
EZK.1.27	From what appeared to be his waist up, he looked like gleaming amber, flickering like a fire. And from his waist down, he looked like a burning flame, shining with splendor. 
EZK.1.28	All around him was a glowing halo, like a rainbow shining in the clouds on a rainy day. This is what the glory of the 
EZK.2.1	“Stand up, son of man,” said the voice. “I want to speak with you.” 
EZK.2.2	The Spirit came into me as he spoke, and he set me on my feet. I listened carefully to his words. 
EZK.2.3	“Son of man,” he said, “I am sending you to the nation of Israel, a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me. They and their ancestors have been rebelling against me to this very day. 
EZK.2.4	They are a stubborn and hard-hearted people. But I am sending you to say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.2.5	And whether they listen or refuse to listen—for remember, they are rebels—at least they will know they have had a prophet among them.
EZK.2.6	“Son of man, do not fear them or their words. Don’t be afraid even though their threats surround you like nettles and briers and stinging scorpions. Do not be dismayed by their dark scowls, even though they are rebels. 
EZK.2.7	You must give them my messages whether they listen or not. But they won’t listen, for they are completely rebellious! 
EZK.2.8	Son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not join them in their rebellion. Open your mouth, and eat what I give you.”
EZK.2.9	Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me. It held a scroll, 
EZK.2.10	which he unrolled. And I saw that both sides were covered with funeral songs, words of sorrow, and pronouncements of doom.
EZK.3.1	The voice said to me, “Son of man, eat what I am giving you—eat this scroll! Then go and give its message to the people of Israel.” 
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll. 
EZK.3.3	“Fill your stomach with this,” he said. And when I ate it, it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.
EZK.3.4	Then he said, “Son of man, go to the people of Israel and give them my messages. 
EZK.3.5	I am not sending you to a foreign people whose language you cannot understand. 
EZK.3.6	No, I am not sending you to people with strange and difficult speech. If I did, they would listen! 
EZK.3.7	But the people of Israel won’t listen to you any more than they listen to me! For the whole lot of them are hard-hearted and stubborn. 
EZK.3.8	But look, I have made you as obstinate and hard-hearted as they are. 
EZK.3.9	I have made your forehead as hard as the hardest rock! So don’t be afraid of them or fear their angry looks, even though they are rebels.”
EZK.3.10	Then he added, “Son of man, let all my words sink deep into your own heart first. Listen to them carefully for yourself. 
EZK.3.11	Then go to your people in exile and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.3.12	Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me. (May the glory of the 
EZK.3.13	It was the sound of the wings of the living beings as they brushed against each other and the rumbling of their wheels beneath them.
EZK.3.14	The Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I went in bitterness and turmoil, but the 
EZK.3.15	Then I came to the colony of Judean exiles in Tel-abib, beside the Kebar River. I was overwhelmed and sat among them for seven days.
EZK.3.16	After seven days the 
EZK.3.17	“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for Israel. Whenever you receive a message from me, warn people immediately. 
EZK.3.18	If I warn the wicked, saying, ‘You are under the penalty of death,’ but you fail to deliver the warning, they will die in their sins. And I will hold you responsible for their deaths. 
EZK.3.19	If you warn them and they refuse to repent and keep on sinning, they will die in their sins. But you will have saved yourself because you obeyed me.
EZK.3.20	“If righteous people turn away from their righteous behavior and ignore the obstacles I put in their way, they will die. And if you do not warn them, they will die in their sins. None of their righteous acts will be remembered, and I will hold you responsible for their deaths. 
EZK.3.21	But if you warn righteous people not to sin and they listen to you and do not sin, they will live, and you will have saved yourself, too.”
EZK.3.22	Then the 
EZK.3.23	So I got up and went, and there I saw the glory of the 
EZK.3.24	Then the Spirit came into me and set me on my feet. He spoke to me and said, “Go to your house and shut yourself in. 
EZK.3.25	There, son of man, you will be tied with ropes so you cannot go out among the people. 
EZK.3.26	And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be speechless and unable to rebuke them, for they are rebels. 
EZK.3.27	But when I give you a message, I will loosen your tongue and let you speak. Then you will say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.4.1	“And now, son of man, take a large clay brick and set it down in front of you. Then draw a map of the city of Jerusalem on it. 
EZK.4.2	Show the city under siege. Build a wall around it so no one can escape. Set up the enemy camp, and surround the city with siege ramps and battering rams. 
EZK.4.3	Then take an iron griddle and place it between you and the city. Turn toward the city and demonstrate how harsh the siege will be against Jerusalem. This will be a warning to the people of Israel.
EZK.4.4	“Now lie on your left side and place the sins of Israel on yourself. You are to bear their sins for the number of days you lie there on your side. 
EZK.4.5	I am requiring you to bear Israel’s sins for 390 days—one day for each year of their sin. 
EZK.4.6	After that, turn over and lie on your right side for 40 days—one day for each year of Judah’s sin.
EZK.4.7	“Meanwhile, keep staring at the siege of Jerusalem. Lie there with your arm bared and prophesy her destruction. 
EZK.4.8	I will tie you up with ropes so you won’t be able to turn from side to side until the days of your siege have been completed.
EZK.4.9	“Now go and get some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and emmer wheat, and mix them together in a storage jar. Use them to make bread for yourself during the 390 days you will be lying on your side. 
EZK.4.10	Ration this out to yourself, eight ounces
EZK.4.11	Then measure out a jar
EZK.4.12	Prepare and eat this food as you would barley cakes. While all the people are watching, bake it over a fire using dried human dung as fuel and then eat the bread.” 
EZK.4.13	Then the 
EZK.4.14	Then I said, “O Sovereign 
EZK.4.15	“All right,” the 
EZK.4.16	Then he told me, “Son of man, I will make food very scarce in Jerusalem. It will be weighed out with great care and eaten fearfully. The water will be rationed out drop by drop, and the people will drink it with dismay. 
EZK.4.17	Lacking food and water, people will look at one another in terror, and they will waste away under their punishment.
EZK.5.1	“Son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a razor to shave your head and beard. Use a scale to weigh the hair into three equal parts. 
EZK.5.2	Place a third of it at the center of your map of Jerusalem. After acting out the siege, burn it there. Scatter another third across your map and chop it with a sword. Scatter the last third to the wind, for I will scatter my people with the sword. 
EZK.5.3	Keep just a bit of the hair and tie it up in your robe. 
EZK.5.4	Then take some of these hairs out and throw them into the fire, burning them up. A fire will then spread from this remnant and destroy all of Israel.
EZK.5.5	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.5.6	but she has rebelled against my regulations and decrees and has been even more wicked than the surrounding nations. She has refused to obey the regulations and decrees I gave her to follow.
EZK.5.7	“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.5.8	Therefore, I myself, the Sovereign 
EZK.5.9	Because of your detestable idols, I will punish you like I have never punished anyone before or ever will again. 
EZK.5.10	Parents will eat their own children, and children will eat their parents. I will punish you and scatter to the winds the few who survive.
EZK.5.11	“As surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.5.12	A third of your people will die in the city from disease and famine. A third of them will be slaughtered by the enemy outside the city walls. And I will scatter a third to the winds, chasing them with my sword. 
EZK.5.13	Then at last my anger will be spent, and I will be satisfied. And when my fury against them has subsided, all Israel will know that I, the 
EZK.5.14	“So I will turn you into a ruin, a mockery in the eyes of the surrounding nations and to all who pass by. 
EZK.5.15	You will become an object of mockery and taunting and horror. You will be a warning to all the nations around you. They will see what happens when the 
EZK.5.16	“I will shower you with the deadly arrows of famine to destroy you. The famine will become more and more severe until every crumb of food is gone. 
EZK.5.17	And along with the famine, wild animals will attack you and rob you of your children. Disease and war will stalk your land, and I will bring the sword of the enemy against you. I, the 
EZK.6.1	Again a message came to me from the 
EZK.6.2	“Son of man, turn and face the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them. 
EZK.6.3	Proclaim this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.6.4	All your altars will be demolished, and your places of worship will be destroyed. I will kill your people in front of your idols.
EZK.6.5	I will lay your corpses in front of your idols and scatter your bones around your altars. 
EZK.6.6	Wherever you live there will be desolation, and I will destroy your pagan shrines. Your altars will be demolished, your idols will be smashed, your places of worship will be torn down, and all the religious objects you have made will be destroyed. 
EZK.6.7	The place will be littered with corpses, and you will know that I alone am the 
EZK.6.8	“But I will let a few of my people escape destruction, and they will be scattered among the nations of the world. 
EZK.6.9	Then when they are exiled among the nations, they will remember me. They will recognize how hurt I am by their unfaithful hearts and lustful eyes that long for their idols. Then at last they will hate themselves for all their detestable sins. 
EZK.6.10	They will know that I alone am the 
EZK.6.11	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.6.12	Disease will strike down those who are far away in exile. War will destroy those who are nearby. And anyone who survives will be killed by famine. So at last I will spend my fury on them. 
EZK.6.13	They will know that I am the 
EZK.6.14	I will crush them and make their cities desolate from the wilderness in the south to Riblah
EZK.7.1	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.7.2	“Son of man, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.7.2	“The end is here!
EZK.7.2	Wherever you look—
EZK.7.2	east, west, north, or south—
EZK.7.2	your land is finished.
EZK.7.3	No hope remains,
EZK.7.3	for I will unleash my anger against you.
EZK.7.3	I will call you to account
EZK.7.3	for all your detestable sins.
EZK.7.4	I will turn my eyes away and show no pity.
EZK.7.4	I will repay you for all your detestable sins.
EZK.7.4	Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.7.5	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.7.5	Disaster after disaster
EZK.7.5	is coming your way!
EZK.7.6	The end has come.
EZK.7.6	It has finally arrived.
EZK.7.6	Your final doom is waiting!
EZK.7.7	O people of Israel, the day of your destruction is dawning.
EZK.7.7	The time has come; the day of trouble is near.
EZK.7.7	Shouts of anguish will be heard on the mountains,
EZK.7.7	not shouts of joy.
EZK.7.8	Soon I will pour out my fury on you
EZK.7.8	and unleash my anger against you.
EZK.7.8	I will call you to account
EZK.7.8	for all your detestable sins.
EZK.7.9	I will turn my eyes away and show no pity.
EZK.7.9	I will repay you for all your detestable sins.
EZK.7.9	Then you will know that it is I, the 
EZK.7.9	who is striking the blow.
EZK.7.10	“The day of judgment is here;
EZK.7.10	your destruction awaits!
EZK.7.10	The people’s wickedness and pride
EZK.7.10	have blossomed to full flower.
EZK.7.11	Their violence has grown into a rod
EZK.7.11	that will beat them for their wickedness.
EZK.7.11	None of these proud and wicked people will survive.
EZK.7.11	All their wealth and prestige will be swept away.
EZK.7.12	Yes, the time has come;
EZK.7.12	the day is here!
EZK.7.12	Buyers should not rejoice over bargains,
EZK.7.12	nor sellers grieve over losses,
EZK.7.12	for all of them will fall
EZK.7.12	under my terrible anger.
EZK.7.13	Even if the merchants survive,
EZK.7.13	they will never return to their business.
EZK.7.13	For what God has said applies to everyone—
EZK.7.13	it will not be changed!
EZK.7.13	Not one person whose life is twisted by sin
EZK.7.13	will ever recover.
EZK.7.14	“The trumpet calls Israel’s army to mobilize,
EZK.7.14	but no one listens,
EZK.7.14	for my fury is against them all.
EZK.7.15	There is war outside the city
EZK.7.15	and disease and famine within.
EZK.7.15	Those outside the city walls
EZK.7.15	will be killed by enemy swords.
EZK.7.15	Those inside the city
EZK.7.15	will die of famine and disease.
EZK.7.16	The survivors who escape to the mountains
EZK.7.16	will moan like doves, weeping for their sins.
EZK.7.17	Their hands will hang limp,
EZK.7.17	their knees will be weak as water.
EZK.7.18	They will dress themselves in burlap;
EZK.7.18	horror and shame will cover them.
EZK.7.18	They will shave their heads
EZK.7.18	in sorrow and remorse.
EZK.7.19	“They will throw their money in the streets,
EZK.7.19	tossing it out like worthless trash.
EZK.7.19	Their silver and gold won’t save them
EZK.7.19	on that day of the 
EZK.7.19	It will neither satisfy nor feed them,
EZK.7.19	for their greed can only trip them up.
EZK.7.20	They were proud of their beautiful jewelry
EZK.7.20	and used it to make detestable idols and vile images.
EZK.7.20	Therefore, I will make all their wealth
EZK.7.20	disgusting to them.
EZK.7.21	I will give it as plunder to foreigners,
EZK.7.21	to the most wicked of nations,
EZK.7.21	and they will defile it.
EZK.7.22	I will turn my eyes from them
EZK.7.22	as these robbers invade and defile my treasured land.
EZK.7.23	“Prepare chains for my people,
EZK.7.23	for the land is bloodied by terrible crimes.
EZK.7.23	Jerusalem is filled with violence.
EZK.7.24	I will bring the most ruthless of nations
EZK.7.24	to occupy their homes.
EZK.7.24	I will break down their proud fortresses
EZK.7.24	and defile their sanctuaries.
EZK.7.25	Terror and trembling will overcome my people.
EZK.7.25	They will look for peace but not find it.
EZK.7.26	Calamity will follow calamity;
EZK.7.26	rumor will follow rumor.
EZK.7.26	They will look in vain
EZK.7.26	for a vision from the prophets.
EZK.7.26	They will receive no teaching from the priests
EZK.7.26	and no counsel from the leaders.
EZK.7.27	The king and the prince will stand helpless,
EZK.7.27	weeping in despair,
EZK.7.27	and the people’s hands
EZK.7.27	will tremble with fear.
EZK.7.27	I will bring on them
EZK.7.27	the evil they have done to others,
EZK.7.27	and they will receive the punishment
EZK.7.27	they so richly deserve.
EZK.7.27	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.8.1	Then on September 17,
EZK.8.2	I saw a figure that appeared to be a man.
EZK.8.3	He reached out what seemed to be a hand and took me by the hair. Then the Spirit lifted me up into the sky and transported me to Jerusalem in a vision from God. I was taken to the north gate of the inner courtyard of the Temple, where there is a large idol that has made the 
EZK.8.4	Suddenly, the glory of the God of Israel was there, just as I had seen it before in the valley.
EZK.8.5	Then the 
EZK.8.6	“Son of man,” he said, “do you see what they are doing? Do you see the detestable sins the people of Israel are committing to drive me from my Temple? But come, and you will see even more detestable sins than these!” 
EZK.8.7	Then he brought me to the door of the Temple courtyard, where I could see a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	He said to me, “Now, son of man, dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and found a hidden doorway.
EZK.8.9	“Go in,” he said, “and see the wicked and detestable sins they are committing in there!” 
EZK.8.10	So I went in and saw the walls covered with engravings of all kinds of crawling animals and detestable creatures. I also saw the various idols
EZK.8.11	Seventy leaders of Israel were standing there with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan in the center. Each of them held an incense burner, from which a cloud of incense rose above their heads.
EZK.8.12	Then the 
EZK.8.13	Then the 
EZK.8.14	He brought me to the north gate of the 
EZK.8.15	“Have you seen this?” he asked. “But I will show you even more detestable sins than these!”
EZK.8.16	Then he brought me into the inner courtyard of the 
EZK.8.17	“Have you seen this, son of man?” he asked. “Is it nothing to the people of Judah that they commit these detestable sins, leading the whole nation into violence, thumbing their noses at me, and provoking my anger? 
EZK.8.18	Therefore, I will respond in fury. I will neither pity nor spare them. And though they cry for mercy, I will not listen.”
EZK.9.1	Then the 
EZK.9.2	Six men soon appeared from the upper gate that faces north, each carrying a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man dressed in linen, who carried a writer’s case at his side. They all went into the Temple courtyard and stood beside the bronze altar.
EZK.9.3	Then the glory of the God of Israel rose up from between the cherubim, where it had rested, and moved to the entrance of the Temple. And the 
EZK.9.4	He said to him, “Walk through the streets of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of all who weep and sigh because of the detestable sins being committed in their city.”
EZK.9.5	Then I heard the 
EZK.9.6	Kill them all—old and young, girls and women and little children. But do not touch anyone with the mark. Begin right here at the Temple.” So they began by killing the seventy leaders.
EZK.9.7	“Defile the Temple!” the 
EZK.9.8	While they were out killing, I was all alone. I fell face down on the ground and cried out, “O Sovereign 
EZK.9.9	Then he said to me, “The sins of the people of Israel and Judah are very, very great. The entire land is full of murder; the city is filled with injustice. They are saying, ‘The 
EZK.9.10	So I will not spare them or have any pity on them. I will fully repay them for all they have done.”
EZK.9.11	Then the man in linen clothing, who carried the writer’s case, reported back and said, “I have done as you commanded.”
EZK.10.1	In my vision I saw what appeared to be a throne of blue lapis lazuli above the crystal surface over the heads of the cherubim. 
EZK.10.2	Then the 
EZK.10.3	The cherubim were standing at the south end of the Temple when the man went in, and the cloud of glory filled the inner courtyard. 
EZK.10.4	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.5	The moving wings of the cherubim sounded like the voice of God Almighty
EZK.10.6	The 
EZK.10.7	Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand and took some live coals from the fire burning among them. He put the coals into the hands of the man in linen clothing, and the man took them and went out. 
EZK.10.8	(All the cherubim had what looked like human hands under their wings.)
EZK.10.9	I looked, and each of the four cherubim had a wheel beside him, and the wheels sparkled like beryl. 
EZK.10.10	All four wheels looked alike and were made the same; each wheel had a second wheel turning crosswise within it. 
EZK.10.11	The cherubim could move in any of the four directions they faced, without turning as they moved. They went straight in the direction they faced, never turning aside. 
EZK.10.12	Both the cherubim and the wheels were covered with eyes. The cherubim had eyes all over their bodies, including their hands, their backs, and their wings. 
EZK.10.13	I heard someone refer to the wheels as “the whirling wheels.” 
EZK.10.14	Each of the four cherubim had four faces: the first was the face of an ox,
EZK.10.15	Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the same living beings I had seen beside the Kebar River. 
EZK.10.16	When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved with them. When they lifted their wings to fly, the wheels stayed beside them. 
EZK.10.17	When the cherubim stopped, the wheels stopped. When they flew upward, the wheels rose up, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.
EZK.10.18	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.19	And as I watched, the cherubim flew with their wheels to the east gate of the 
EZK.10.20	These were the same living beings I had seen beneath the God of Israel when I was by the Kebar River. I knew they were cherubim, 
EZK.10.21	for each had four faces and four wings and what looked like human hands under their wings. 
EZK.10.22	And their faces were just like the faces of the beings I had seen at the Kebar, and they traveled straight ahead, just as the others had.
EZK.11.1	Then the Spirit lifted me and brought me to the east gateway of the 
EZK.11.2	The Spirit said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who are planning evil and giving wicked counsel in this city. 
EZK.11.3	They say to the people, ‘Is it not a good time to build houses? This city is like an iron pot. We are safe inside it like meat in a pot.
EZK.11.4	Therefore, son of man, prophesy against them loudly and clearly.”
EZK.11.5	Then the Spirit of the 
EZK.11.6	You have murdered many in this city and filled its streets with the dead.
EZK.11.7	“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.11.8	I will bring on you the sword of war you so greatly fear, says the Sovereign 
EZK.11.9	I will drive you out of Jerusalem and hand you over to foreigners, who will carry out my judgments against you. 
EZK.11.10	You will be slaughtered all the way to the borders of Israel. I will execute judgment on you, and you will know that I am the 
EZK.11.11	No, this city will not be an iron pot for you, and you will not be like meat safe inside it. I will judge you even to the borders of Israel, 
EZK.11.12	and you will know that I am the 
EZK.11.13	While I was still prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah suddenly died. Then I fell face down on the ground and cried out, “O Sovereign 
EZK.11.14	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.11.15	“Son of man, the people still left in Jerusalem are talking about you and your relatives and all the people of Israel who are in exile. They are saying, ‘Those people are far away from the 
EZK.11.16	“Therefore, tell the exiles, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.11.17	I, the Sovereign 
EZK.11.18	“When the people return to their homeland, they will remove every trace of their vile images and detestable idols. 
EZK.11.19	And I will give them singleness of heart and put a new spirit within them. I will take away their stony, stubborn heart and give them a tender, responsive heart,
EZK.11.20	so they will obey my decrees and regulations. Then they will truly be my people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	But as for those who long for vile images and detestable idols, I will repay them fully for their sins. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.11.22	Then the cherubim lifted their wings and rose into the air with their wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them. 
EZK.11.23	Then the glory of the 
EZK.11.24	Afterward the Spirit of God carried me back again to Babylonia,
EZK.11.25	And I told the exiles everything the 
EZK.12.1	Again a message came to me from the 
EZK.12.2	“Son of man, you live among rebels who have eyes but refuse to see. They have ears but refuse to hear. For they are a rebellious people.
EZK.12.3	“So now, son of man, pretend you are being sent into exile. Pack the few items an exile could carry, and leave your home to go somewhere else. Do this right in front of the people so they can see you. For perhaps they will pay attention to this, even though they are such rebels. 
EZK.12.4	Bring your baggage outside during the day so they can watch you. Then in the evening, as they are watching, leave your house as captives do when they begin a long march to distant lands. 
EZK.12.5	Dig a hole through the wall while they are watching and go out through it. 
EZK.12.6	As they watch, lift your pack to your shoulders and walk away into the night. Cover your face so you cannot see the land you are leaving. For I have made you a sign for the people of Israel.”
EZK.12.7	So I did as I was told. In broad daylight I brought my pack outside, filled with the things I might carry into exile. Then in the evening while the people looked on, I dug through the wall with my hands and went out into the night with my pack on my shoulder.
EZK.12.8	The next morning this message came to me from the 
EZK.12.9	“Son of man, these rebels, the people of Israel, have asked you what all this means. 
EZK.12.10	Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.12.11	Explain that your actions are a sign to show what will soon happen to them, for they will be driven into exile as captives.
EZK.12.12	“Even Zedekiah will leave Jerusalem at night through a hole in the wall, taking only what he can carry with him. He will cover his face, and his eyes will not see the land he is leaving. 
EZK.12.13	Then I will throw my net over him and capture him in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Babylonians,
EZK.12.14	I will scatter his servants and warriors to the four winds and send the sword after them. 
EZK.12.15	And when I scatter them among the nations, they will know that I am the 
EZK.12.16	But I will spare a few of them from death by war, famine, or disease, so they can confess all their detestable sins to their captors. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.12.17	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.12.18	“Son of man, tremble as you eat your food. Shake with fear as you drink your water. 
EZK.12.19	Tell the people, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.12.20	The cities will be destroyed and the farmland made desolate. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.12.21	Again a message came to me from the 
EZK.12.22	“Son of man, you’ve heard that proverb they quote in Israel: ‘Time passes, and prophecies come to nothing.’ 
EZK.12.23	Tell the people, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.12.24	“There will be no more false visions and flattering predictions in Israel. 
EZK.12.25	For I am the 
EZK.12.26	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.12.27	“Son of man, the people of Israel are saying, ‘He’s talking about the distant future. His visions won’t come true for a long, long time.’ 
EZK.12.28	Therefore, tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.13.1	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.13.2	“Son of man, prophesy against the false prophets of Israel who are inventing their own prophecies. Say to them, ‘Listen to the word of the 
EZK.13.3	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.13.4	“O people of Israel, these prophets of yours are like jackals digging in the ruins. 
EZK.13.5	They have done nothing to repair the breaks in the walls around the nation. They have not helped it to stand firm in battle on the day of the 
EZK.13.6	Instead, they have told lies and made false predictions. They say, ‘This message is from the 
EZK.13.7	Can your visions be anything but false if you claim, ‘This message is from the 
EZK.13.8	“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.13.9	I will raise my fist against all the prophets who see false visions and make lying predictions, and they will be banished from the community of Israel. I will blot their names from Israel’s record books, and they will never again set foot in their own land. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign 
EZK.13.10	“This will happen because these evil prophets deceive my people by saying, ‘All is peaceful’ when there is no peace at all! It’s as if the people have built a flimsy wall, and these prophets are trying to reinforce it by covering it with whitewash! 
EZK.13.11	Tell these whitewashers that their wall will soon fall down. A heavy rainstorm will undermine it; great hailstones and mighty winds will knock it down. 
EZK.13.12	And when the wall falls, the people will cry out, ‘What happened to your whitewash?’
EZK.13.13	“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.13.14	I will break down your wall right to its foundation, and when it falls, it will crush you. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.13.15	At last my anger against the wall and those who covered it with whitewash will be satisfied. Then I will say to you: ‘The wall and those who whitewashed it are both gone. 
EZK.13.16	They were lying prophets who claimed peace would come to Jerusalem when there was no peace. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.13.17	“Now, son of man, speak out against the women who prophesy from their own imaginations. 
EZK.13.18	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.13.19	You bring shame on me among my people for a few handfuls of barley or a piece of bread. By lying to my people who love to listen to lies, you kill those who should not die, and you promise life to those who should not live.
EZK.13.20	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.13.21	I will tear off the magic veils and save my people from your grasp. They will no longer be your victims. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.13.22	You have discouraged the righteous with your lies, but I didn’t want them to be sad. And you have encouraged the wicked by promising them life, even though they continue in their sins. 
EZK.13.23	Because of all this, you will no longer talk of seeing visions that you never saw, nor will you make predictions. For I will rescue my people from your grasp. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.14.1	Then some of the leaders of Israel visited me, and while they were sitting with me, 
EZK.14.2	this message came to me from the 
EZK.14.3	“Son of man, these leaders have set up idols
EZK.14.4	Tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.14.5	I will do this to capture the minds and hearts of all my people who have turned from me to worship their detestable idols.’
EZK.14.6	“Therefore, tell the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.14.7	I, the 
EZK.14.8	I will turn against such people and make a terrible example of them, eliminating them from among my people. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.14.9	“‘And if a prophet is deceived into giving a message, it is because I, the 
EZK.14.10	False prophets and those who seek their guidance will all be punished for their sins. 
EZK.14.11	In this way, the people of Israel will learn not to stray from me, polluting themselves with sin. They will be my people, and I will be their God. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.14.12	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.14.13	“Son of man, suppose the people of a country were to sin against me, and I lifted my fist to crush them, cutting off their food supply and sending a famine to destroy both people and animals. 
EZK.14.14	Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were there, their righteousness would save no one but themselves, says the Sovereign 
EZK.14.15	“Or suppose I were to send wild animals to invade the country, kill the people, and make the land too desolate and dangerous to pass through. 
EZK.14.16	As surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.14.17	“Or suppose I were to bring war against the land, and I sent enemy armies to destroy both people and animals. 
EZK.14.18	As surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.14.19	“Or suppose I were to pour out my fury by sending an epidemic into the land, and the disease killed people and animals alike. 
EZK.14.20	As surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.14.21	“Now this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.14.22	Yet there will be survivors, and they will come here to join you as exiles in Babylon. You will see with your own eyes how wicked they are, and then you will feel better about what I have done to Jerusalem. 
EZK.14.23	When you meet them and see their behavior, you will understand that these things are not being done to Israel without cause. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.15.1	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.15.2	“Son of man, how does a grapevine compare to a tree? Is a vine’s wood as useful as the wood of a tree? 
EZK.15.3	Can its wood be used for making things, like pegs to hang up pots and pans? 
EZK.15.4	No, it can only be used for fuel, and even as fuel, it burns too quickly. 
EZK.15.5	Vines are useless both before and after being put into the fire!
EZK.15.6	“And this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.15.7	And I will see to it that if they escape from one fire, they will fall into another. When I turn against them, you will know that I am the 
EZK.15.8	And I will make the land desolate because my people have been unfaithful to me. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.16.1	Then another message came to me from the 
EZK.16.2	“Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable sins. 
EZK.16.3	Give her this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.16.4	On the day you were born, no one cared about you. Your umbilical cord was not cut, and you were never washed, rubbed with salt, and wrapped in cloth. 
EZK.16.5	No one had the slightest interest in you; no one pitied you or cared for you. On the day you were born, you were unwanted, dumped in a field and left to die.
EZK.16.6	“But I came by and saw you there, helplessly kicking about in your own blood. As you lay there, I said, ‘Live!’ 
EZK.16.7	And I helped you to thrive like a plant in the field. You grew up and became a beautiful jewel. Your breasts became full, and your body hair grew, but you were still naked. 
EZK.16.8	And when I passed by again, I saw that you were old enough for love. So I wrapped my cloak around you to cover your nakedness and declared my marriage vows. I made a covenant with you, says the Sovereign 
EZK.16.9	“Then I bathed you and washed off your blood, and I rubbed fragrant oils into your skin. 
EZK.16.10	I gave you expensive clothing of fine linen and silk, beautifully embroidered, and sandals made of fine goatskin leather. 
EZK.16.11	I gave you lovely jewelry, bracelets, beautiful necklaces, 
EZK.16.12	a ring for your nose, earrings for your ears, and a lovely crown for your head. 
EZK.16.13	And so you were adorned with gold and silver. Your clothes were made of fine linen and costly fabric and were beautifully embroidered. You ate the finest foods—choice flour, honey, and olive oil—and became more beautiful than ever. You looked like a queen, and so you were! 
EZK.16.14	Your fame soon spread throughout the world because of your beauty. I dressed you in my splendor and perfected your beauty, says the Sovereign 
EZK.16.15	“But you thought your fame and beauty were your own. So you gave yourself as a prostitute to every man who came along. Your beauty was theirs for the asking. 
EZK.16.16	You used the lovely things I gave you to make shrines for idols, where you played the prostitute. Unbelievable! How could such a thing ever happen? 
EZK.16.17	You took the very jewels and gold and silver ornaments I had given you and made statues of men and worshiped them. This is adultery against me! 
EZK.16.18	You used the beautifully embroidered clothes I gave you to dress your idols. Then you used my special oil and my incense to worship them. 
EZK.16.19	Imagine it! You set before them as a sacrifice the choice flour, olive oil, and honey I had given you, says the Sovereign 
EZK.16.20	“Then you took your sons and daughters—the children you had borne to me—and sacrificed them to your gods. Was your prostitution not enough? 
EZK.16.21	Must you also slaughter my children by sacrificing them to idols? 
EZK.16.22	In all your years of adultery and detestable sin, you have not once remembered the days long ago when you lay naked in a field, kicking about in your own blood.
EZK.16.23	“What sorrow awaits you, says the Sovereign 
EZK.16.24	you built a pagan shrine and put altars to idols in every town square. 
EZK.16.25	On every street corner you defiled your beauty, offering your body to every passerby in an endless stream of prostitution. 
EZK.16.26	Then you added lustful Egypt to your lovers, provoking my anger with your increasing promiscuity. 
EZK.16.27	That is why I struck you with my fist and reduced your boundaries. I handed you over to your enemies, the Philistines, and even they were shocked by your lewd conduct. 
EZK.16.28	You have prostituted yourself with the Assyrians, too. It seems you can never find enough new lovers! And after your prostitution there, you still were not satisfied. 
EZK.16.29	You added to your lovers by embracing Babylonia,
EZK.16.30	“What a sick heart you have, says the Sovereign 
EZK.16.31	You build your pagan shrines on every street corner and your altars to idols in every square. In fact, you have been worse than a prostitute, so eager for sin that you have not even demanded payment. 
EZK.16.32	Yes, you are an adulterous wife who takes in strangers instead of her own husband. 
EZK.16.33	Prostitutes charge for their services—but not you! You give gifts to your lovers, bribing them to come and have sex with you. 
EZK.16.34	So you are the opposite of other prostitutes. You pay your lovers instead of their paying you!
EZK.16.35	“Therefore, you prostitute, listen to this message from the 
EZK.16.36	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.16.37	this is what I am going to do. I will gather together all your allies—the lovers with whom you have sinned, both those you loved and those you hated—and I will strip you naked in front of them so they can stare at you. 
EZK.16.38	I will punish you for your murder and adultery. I will cover you with blood in my jealous fury. 
EZK.16.39	Then I will give you to these many nations who are your lovers, and they will destroy you. They will knock down your pagan shrines and the altars to your idols. They will strip you and take your beautiful jewels, leaving you stark naked. 
EZK.16.40	They will band together in a mob to stone you and cut you up with swords. 
EZK.16.41	They will burn your homes and punish you in front of many women. I will stop your prostitution and end your payments to your many lovers.
EZK.16.42	“Then at last my fury against you will be spent, and my jealous anger will subside. I will be calm and will not be angry with you anymore. 
EZK.16.43	But first, because you have not remembered your youth but have angered me by doing all these evil things, I will fully repay you for all of your sins, says the Sovereign 
EZK.16.44	Everyone who makes up proverbs will say of you, ‘Like mother, like daughter.’ 
EZK.16.45	For your mother loathed her husband and her children, and so do you. And you are exactly like your sisters, for they despised their husbands and their children. Truly your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
EZK.16.46	“Your older sister was Samaria, who lived with her daughters in the north. Your younger sister was Sodom, who lived with her daughters in the south. 
EZK.16.47	But you have not merely sinned as they did. You quickly surpassed them in corruption. 
EZK.16.48	As surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.16.49	Sodom’s sins were pride, gluttony, and laziness, while the poor and needy suffered outside her door. 
EZK.16.50	She was proud and committed detestable sins, so I wiped her out, as you have seen.
EZK.16.51	“Even Samaria did not commit half your sins. You have done far more detestable things than your sisters ever did. They seem righteous compared to you. 
EZK.16.52	Shame on you! Your sins are so terrible that you make your sisters seem righteous, even virtuous.
EZK.16.53	“But someday I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and Samaria, and I will restore you, too. 
EZK.16.54	Then you will be truly ashamed of everything you have done, for your sins make them feel good in comparison. 
EZK.16.55	Yes, your sisters, Sodom and Samaria, and all their people will be restored, and at that time you also will be restored. 
EZK.16.56	In your proud days you held Sodom in contempt. 
EZK.16.57	But now your greater wickedness has been exposed to all the world, and you are the one who is scorned—by Edom
EZK.16.58	This is your punishment for all your lewdness and detestable sins, says the 
EZK.16.59	“Now this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.16.60	Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you when you were young, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. 
EZK.16.61	Then you will remember with shame all the evil you have done. I will make your sisters, Samaria and Sodom, to be your daughters, even though they are not part of our covenant. 
EZK.16.62	And I will reaffirm my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the 
EZK.16.63	You will remember your sins and cover your mouth in silent shame when I forgive you of all that you have done. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.17.1	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.17.2	“Son of man, give this riddle, and tell this story to the people of Israel. 
EZK.17.3	Give them this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.17.3	“A great eagle with broad wings and long feathers,
EZK.17.3	covered with many-colored plumage,
EZK.17.3	came to Lebanon.
EZK.17.3	He seized the top of a cedar tree
EZK.17.4	and plucked off its highest branch.
EZK.17.4	He carried it away to a city filled with merchants.
EZK.17.4	He planted it in a city of traders.
EZK.17.5	He also took a seedling from the land
EZK.17.5	and planted it in fertile soil.
EZK.17.5	He placed it beside a broad river,
EZK.17.5	where it could grow like a willow tree.
EZK.17.6	It took root there and
EZK.17.6	grew into a low, spreading vine.
EZK.17.6	Its branches turned up toward the eagle,
EZK.17.6	and its roots grew down into the ground.
EZK.17.6	It produced strong branches
EZK.17.6	and put out shoots.
EZK.17.7	But then another great eagle came
EZK.17.7	with broad wings and full plumage.
EZK.17.7	So the vine now sent its roots and branches
EZK.17.7	toward him for water,
EZK.17.8	even though it was already planted in good soil
EZK.17.8	and had plenty of water
EZK.17.8	so it could grow into a splendid vine
EZK.17.8	and produce rich leaves and luscious fruit.
EZK.17.9	“So now the Sovereign 
EZK.17.9	Will this vine grow and prosper?
EZK.17.9	No! I will pull it up, roots and all!
EZK.17.9	I will cut off its fruit
EZK.17.9	and let its leaves wither and die.
EZK.17.9	I will pull it up easily
EZK.17.9	without a strong arm or a large army.
EZK.17.10	But when the vine is transplanted,
EZK.17.10	will it thrive?
EZK.17.10	No, it will wither away
EZK.17.10	when the east wind blows against it.
EZK.17.10	It will die in the same good soil
EZK.17.10	where it had grown so well.”
EZK.17.11	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.17.12	“Say to these rebels of Israel: Don’t you understand the meaning of this riddle of the eagles? The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took away her king and princes, and brought them to Babylon. 
EZK.17.13	He made a treaty with a member of the royal family and forced him to take an oath of loyalty. He also exiled Israel’s most influential leaders, 
EZK.17.14	so Israel would not become strong again and revolt. Only by keeping her treaty with Babylon could Israel survive.
EZK.17.15	“Nevertheless, this man of Israel’s royal family rebelled against Babylon, sending ambassadors to Egypt to request a great army and many horses. Can Israel break her sworn treaties like that and get away with it? 
EZK.17.16	No! For as surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.17.17	Pharaoh and all his mighty army will fail to help Israel when the king of Babylon lays siege to Jerusalem again and destroys many lives. 
EZK.17.18	For the king of Israel disregarded his treaty and broke it after swearing to obey; therefore, he will not escape.
EZK.17.19	“So this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.17.20	I will throw my net over him and capture him in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon and put him on trial for this treason against me. 
EZK.17.21	And all his best warriors
EZK.17.22	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.17.23	It will become a majestic cedar, sending forth its branches and producing seed. Birds of every sort will nest in it, finding shelter in the shade of its branches. 
EZK.17.24	And all the trees will know that it is I, the 
EZK.18.1	Then another message came to me from the 
EZK.18.2	“Why do you quote this proverb concerning the land of Israel: ‘The parents have eaten sour grapes, but their children’s mouths pucker at the taste’? 
EZK.18.3	As surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.18.4	For all people are mine to judge—both parents and children alike. And this is my rule: The person who sins is the one who will die.
EZK.18.5	“Suppose a certain man is righteous and does what is just and right. 
EZK.18.6	He does not feast in the mountains before Israel’s idols
EZK.18.7	He is a merciful creditor, not keeping the items given as security by poor debtors. He does not rob the poor but instead gives food to the hungry and provides clothes for the needy. 
EZK.18.8	He grants loans without interest, stays away from injustice, is honest and fair when judging others, 
EZK.18.9	and faithfully obeys my decrees and regulations. Anyone who does these things is just and will surely live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.18.10	“But suppose that man has a son who grows up to be a robber or murderer and refuses to do what is right. 
EZK.18.11	And that son does all the evil things his father would never do—he worships idols on the mountains, commits adultery, 
EZK.18.12	oppresses the poor and helpless, steals from debtors by refusing to let them redeem their security, worships idols, commits detestable sins, 
EZK.18.13	and lends money at excessive interest. Should such a sinful person live? No! He must die and must take full blame.
EZK.18.14	“But suppose that sinful son, in turn, has a son who sees his father’s wickedness and decides against that kind of life. 
EZK.18.15	This son refuses to worship idols on the mountains and does not commit adultery. 
EZK.18.16	He does not exploit the poor, but instead is fair to debtors and does not rob them. He gives food to the hungry and provides clothes for the needy. 
EZK.18.17	He helps the poor,
EZK.18.18	But the father will die for his many sins—for being cruel, robbing people, and doing what was clearly wrong among his people.
EZK.18.19	“‘What?’ you ask. ‘Doesn’t the child pay for the parent’s sins?’ No! For if the child does what is just and right and keeps my decrees, that child will surely live. 
EZK.18.20	The person who sins is the one who will die. The child will not be punished for the parent’s sins, and the parent will not be punished for the child’s sins. Righteous people will be rewarded for their own righteous behavior, and wicked people will be punished for their own wickedness. 
EZK.18.21	But if wicked people turn away from all their sins and begin to obey my decrees and do what is just and right, they will surely live and not die. 
EZK.18.22	All their past sins will be forgotten, and they will live because of the righteous things they have done.
EZK.18.23	“Do you think that I like to see wicked people die? says the Sovereign 
EZK.18.24	However, if righteous people turn from their righteous behavior and start doing sinful things and act like other sinners, should they be allowed to live? No, of course not! All their righteous acts will be forgotten, and they will die for their sins.
EZK.18.25	“Yet you say, ‘The Lord isn’t doing what’s right!’ Listen to me, O people of Israel. Am I the one not doing what’s right, or is it you? 
EZK.18.26	When righteous people turn from their righteous behavior and start doing sinful things, they will die for it. Yes, they will die because of their sinful deeds. 
EZK.18.27	And if wicked people turn from their wickedness, obey the law, and do what is just and right, they will save their lives. 
EZK.18.28	They will live because they thought it over and decided to turn from their sins. Such people will not die. 
EZK.18.29	And yet the people of Israel keep saying, ‘The Lord isn’t doing what’s right!’ O people of Israel, it is you who are not doing what’s right, not I.
EZK.18.30	“Therefore, I will judge each of you, O people of Israel, according to your actions, says the Sovereign 
EZK.18.31	Put all your rebellion behind you, and find yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O people of Israel? 
EZK.18.32	I don’t want you to die, says the Sovereign 
EZK.19.1	“Sing this funeral song for the princes of Israel:
EZK.19.2	“What is your mother?
EZK.19.2	A lioness among lions!
EZK.19.2	She lay down among the young lions
EZK.19.2	and reared her cubs.
EZK.19.3	She raised one of her cubs
EZK.19.3	to become a strong young lion.
EZK.19.3	He learned to hunt and devour prey,
EZK.19.3	and he became a man-eater.
EZK.19.4	Then the nations heard about him,
EZK.19.4	and he was trapped in their pit.
EZK.19.4	They led him away with hooks
EZK.19.4	to the land of Egypt.
EZK.19.5	“When the lioness saw
EZK.19.5	that her hopes for him were gone,
EZK.19.5	she took another of her cubs
EZK.19.5	and taught him to be a strong young lion.
EZK.19.6	He prowled among the other lions
EZK.19.6	and stood out among them in his strength.
EZK.19.6	He learned to hunt and devour prey,
EZK.19.6	and he, too, became a man-eater.
EZK.19.7	He demolished fortresses
EZK.19.7	and destroyed their towns and cities.
EZK.19.7	Their farms were desolated,
EZK.19.7	and their crops were destroyed.
EZK.19.7	The land and its people trembled in fear
EZK.19.7	when they heard him roar.
EZK.19.8	Then the armies of the nations attacked him,
EZK.19.8	surrounding him from every direction.
EZK.19.8	They threw a net over him
EZK.19.8	and captured him in their pit.
EZK.19.9	With hooks, they dragged him into a cage
EZK.19.9	and brought him before the king of Babylon.
EZK.19.9	They held him in captivity,
EZK.19.9	so his voice could never again be heard
EZK.19.9	on the mountains of Israel.
EZK.19.10	“Your mother was like a vine
EZK.19.10	planted by the water’s edge.
EZK.19.10	It had lush, green foliage
EZK.19.10	because of the abundant water.
EZK.19.11	Its branches became strong—
EZK.19.11	strong enough to be a ruler’s scepter.
EZK.19.11	It grew very tall,
EZK.19.11	towering above all others.
EZK.19.11	It stood out because of its height
EZK.19.11	and its many lush branches.
EZK.19.12	But the vine was uprooted in fury
EZK.19.12	and thrown down to the ground.
EZK.19.12	The desert wind dried up its fruit
EZK.19.12	and tore off its strong branches,
EZK.19.12	so that it withered
EZK.19.12	and was destroyed by fire.
EZK.19.13	Now the vine is transplanted to the wilderness,
EZK.19.13	where the ground is hard and dry.
EZK.19.14	A fire has burst out from its branches
EZK.19.14	and devoured its fruit.
EZK.19.14	Its remaining limbs are not
EZK.19.14	strong enough to be a ruler’s scepter.
EZK.19.14	“This is a funeral song, and it will be used in a funeral.”
EZK.20.1	On August 14,
EZK.20.2	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.20.3	“Son of man, tell the leaders of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.20.4	“Son of man, bring charges against them and condemn them. Make them realize how detestable the sins of their ancestors really were. 
EZK.20.5	Give them this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.20.6	I took a solemn oath that day that I would bring them out of Egypt to a land I had discovered and explored for them—a good land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the best of all lands anywhere. 
EZK.20.7	Then I said to them, ‘Each of you, get rid of the vile images you are so obsessed with. Do not defile yourselves with the idols
EZK.20.8	“But they rebelled against me and would not listen. They did not get rid of the vile images they were obsessed with, or forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I threatened to pour out my fury on them to satisfy my anger while they were still in Egypt. 
EZK.20.9	But I didn’t do it, for I acted to protect the honor of my name. I would not allow shame to be brought on my name among the surrounding nations who saw me reveal myself by bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. 
EZK.20.10	So I brought them out of Egypt and led them into the wilderness. 
EZK.20.11	There I gave them my decrees and regulations so they could find life by keeping them. 
EZK.20.12	And I gave them my Sabbath days of rest as a sign between them and me. It was to remind them that I am the 
EZK.20.13	“But the people of Israel rebelled against me, and they refused to obey my decrees there in the wilderness. They wouldn’t obey my regulations even though obedience would have given them life. They also violated my Sabbath days. So I threatened to pour out my fury on them, and I made plans to utterly consume them in the wilderness. 
EZK.20.14	But again I held back in order to protect the honor of my name before the nations who had seen my power in bringing Israel out of Egypt. 
EZK.20.15	But I took a solemn oath against them in the wilderness. I swore I would not bring them into the land I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful place on earth. 
EZK.20.16	For they had rejected my regulations, refused to follow my decrees, and violated my Sabbath days. Their hearts were given to their idols. 
EZK.20.17	Nevertheless, I took pity on them and held back from destroying them in the wilderness.
EZK.20.18	“Then I warned their children not to follow in their parents’ footsteps, defiling themselves with their idols. 
EZK.20.19	‘I am the 
EZK.20.20	and keep my Sabbath days holy, for they are a sign to remind you that I am the 
EZK.20.21	“But their children, too, rebelled against me. They refused to keep my decrees and follow my regulations, even though obedience would have given them life. And they also violated my Sabbath days. So again I threatened to pour out my fury on them in the wilderness. 
EZK.20.22	Nevertheless, I withdrew my judgment against them to protect the honor of my name before the nations that had seen my power in bringing them out of Egypt. 
EZK.20.23	But I took a solemn oath against them in the wilderness. I swore I would scatter them among all the nations 
EZK.20.24	because they did not obey my regulations. They scorned my decrees by violating my Sabbath days and longing for the idols of their ancestors. 
EZK.20.25	I gave them over to worthless decrees and regulations that would not lead to life. 
EZK.20.26	I let them pollute themselves
EZK.20.27	“Therefore, son of man, give the people of Israel this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.20.28	for when I brought them into the land I had promised them, they offered sacrifices on every high hill and under every green tree they saw! They roused my fury as they offered up sacrifices to their gods. They brought their perfumes and incense and poured out their liquid offerings to them. 
EZK.20.29	I said to them, ‘What is this high place where you are going?’ (This kind of pagan shrine has been called Bamah—‘high place’—ever since.)
EZK.20.30	“Therefore, give the people of Israel this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.20.31	For when you offer gifts to them and give your little children to be burned as sacrifices,
EZK.20.32	“You say, ‘We want to be like the nations all around us, who serve idols of wood and stone.’ But what you have in mind will never happen. 
EZK.20.33	As surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.20.34	And in anger I will reach out with my strong hand and powerful arm, and I will bring you back
EZK.20.35	I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations, and there I will judge you face to face. 
EZK.20.36	I will judge you there just as I did your ancestors in the wilderness after bringing them out of Egypt, says the Sovereign 
EZK.20.37	I will examine you carefully and hold you to the terms of the covenant. 
EZK.20.38	I will purge you of all those who rebel and revolt against me. I will bring them out of the countries where they are in exile, but they will never enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.20.39	“As for you, O people of Israel, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.20.40	For on my holy mountain, the great mountain of Israel, says the Sovereign 
EZK.20.41	When I bring you home from exile, you will be like a pleasing sacrifice to me. And I will display my holiness through you as all the nations watch. 
EZK.20.42	Then when I have brought you home to the land I promised with a solemn oath to give to your ancestors, you will know that I am the 
EZK.20.43	You will look back on all the ways you defiled yourselves and will hate yourselves because of the evil you have done. 
EZK.20.44	You will know that I am the 
EZK.20.45	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.20.46	“Son of man, turn and face the south
EZK.20.47	Tell the southern wilderness, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.20.48	And everyone in the world will see that I, the

EZK.21.2	“Son of man, turn and face Jerusalem and prophesy against Israel and her sanctuaries. 
EZK.21.3	Tell her, ‘This is what the 
EZK.21.4	Yes, I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked! I will draw my sword against everyone in the land from south to north. 
EZK.21.5	Everyone in the world will know that I am the 
EZK.21.6	“Son of man, groan before the people! Groan before them with bitter anguish and a broken heart. 
EZK.21.7	When they ask why you are groaning, tell them, ‘I groan because of the terrifying news I have heard. When it comes true, the boldest heart will melt with fear; all strength will disappear. Every spirit will faint; strong knees will become as weak as water. And the Sovereign 
EZK.21.8	Then the 
EZK.21.9	“Son of man, give the people this message from the Lord:
EZK.21.9	“A sword, a sword
EZK.21.9	is being sharpened and polished.
EZK.21.10	It is sharpened for terrible slaughter
EZK.21.10	and polished to flash like lightning!
EZK.21.10	Now will you laugh?
EZK.21.10	Those far stronger than you have fallen beneath its power!
EZK.21.11	Yes, the sword is now being sharpened and polished;
EZK.21.11	it is being prepared for the executioner.
EZK.21.12	“Son of man, cry out and wail;
EZK.21.12	pound your thighs in anguish,
EZK.21.12	for that sword will slaughter my people and their leaders—
EZK.21.12	everyone will die!
EZK.21.13	It will put them all to the test.
EZK.21.13	What chance do they have?
EZK.21.13	says the Sovereign 
EZK.21.14	“Son of man, prophesy to them
EZK.21.14	and clap your hands.
EZK.21.14	Then take the sword and brandish it twice,
EZK.21.14	even three times,
EZK.21.14	to symbolize the great massacre,
EZK.21.14	the great massacre facing them on every side.
EZK.21.15	Let their hearts melt with terror,
EZK.21.15	for the sword glitters at every gate.
EZK.21.15	It flashes like lightning
EZK.21.15	and is polished for slaughter!
EZK.21.16	O sword, slash to the right,
EZK.21.16	then slash to the left,
EZK.21.16	wherever you will,
EZK.21.16	wherever you want.
EZK.21.17	I, too, will clap my hands,
EZK.21.17	and I will satisfy my fury.
EZK.21.17	I, the 
EZK.21.18	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.21.19	“Son of man, make a map and trace two routes on it for the sword of Babylon’s king to follow. Put a signpost on the road that comes out of Babylon where the road forks into two—
EZK.21.20	one road going to Ammon and its capital, Rabbah, and the other to Judah and fortified Jerusalem. 
EZK.21.21	The king of Babylon now stands at the fork, uncertain whether to attack Jerusalem or Rabbah. He calls his magicians to look for omens. They cast lots by shaking arrows from the quiver. They inspect the livers of animal sacrifices. 
EZK.21.22	The omen in his right hand says, ‘Jerusalem!’ With battering rams his soldiers will go against the gates, shouting for the kill. They will put up siege towers and build ramps against the walls. 
EZK.21.23	The people of Jerusalem will think it is a false omen, because of their treaty with the Babylonians. But the king of Babylon will remind the people of their rebellion. Then he will attack and capture them.
EZK.21.24	“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.21.25	“O you corrupt and wicked prince of Israel, your final day of reckoning is here! 
EZK.21.26	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.21.26	“Take off your jeweled crown,
EZK.21.26	for the old order changes.
EZK.21.26	Now the lowly will be exalted,
EZK.21.26	and the mighty will be brought down.
EZK.21.27	Destruction! Destruction!
EZK.21.27	I will surely destroy the kingdom.
EZK.21.27	And it will not be restored until the one appears
EZK.21.27	who has the right to judge it.
EZK.21.27	Then I will hand it over to him.
EZK.21.28	“And now, son of man, prophesy concerning the Ammonites and their mockery. Give them this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.21.28	“A sword, a sword
EZK.21.28	is drawn for your slaughter.
EZK.21.28	It is polished to destroy,
EZK.21.28	flashing like lightning!
EZK.21.29	Your prophets have given false visions,
EZK.21.29	and your fortune-tellers have told lies.
EZK.21.29	The sword will fall on the necks of the wicked
EZK.21.29	for whom the day of final reckoning has come.
EZK.21.30	“Now return the sword to its sheath,
EZK.21.30	for in your own country,
EZK.21.30	the land of your birth,
EZK.21.30	I will pass judgment upon you.
EZK.21.31	I will pour out my fury on you
EZK.21.31	and blow on you with the fire of my anger.
EZK.21.31	I will hand you over to cruel men
EZK.21.31	who are skilled in destruction.
EZK.21.32	You will be fuel for the fire,
EZK.21.32	and your blood will be spilled in your own land.
EZK.21.32	You will be utterly wiped out,
EZK.21.32	your memory lost to history,
EZK.21.32	for I, the 
EZK.22.1	Now this message came to me from the 
EZK.22.2	“Son of man, are you ready to judge Jerusalem? Are you ready to judge this city of murderers? Publicly denounce her detestable sins, 
EZK.22.3	and give her this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.22.4	you are guilty because of the blood you have shed. You are defiled because of the idols you have made. Your day of destruction has come! You have reached the end of your years. I will make you an object of mockery throughout the world. 
EZK.22.5	O infamous city, filled with confusion, you will be mocked by people far and near.
EZK.22.6	“Every leader in Israel who lives within your walls is bent on murder. 
EZK.22.7	Fathers and mothers are treated with contempt. Foreigners are forced to pay for protection. Orphans and widows are wronged and oppressed among you. 
EZK.22.8	You despise my holy things and violate my Sabbath days of rest. 
EZK.22.9	People accuse others falsely and send them to their death. You are filled with idol worshipers and people who do obscene things. 
EZK.22.10	Men sleep with their fathers’ wives and force themselves on women who are menstruating. 
EZK.22.11	Within your walls live men who commit adultery with their neighbors’ wives, who defile their daughters-in-law, or who rape their own sisters. 
EZK.22.12	There are hired murderers, loan racketeers, and extortioners everywhere. They never even think of me and my commands, says the Sovereign 
EZK.22.13	“But now I clap my hands in indignation over your dishonest gain and bloodshed. 
EZK.22.14	How strong and courageous will you be in my day of reckoning? I, the 
EZK.22.15	I will scatter you among the nations and purge you of your wickedness. 
EZK.22.16	And when I have been dishonored among the nations because of you,
EZK.22.17	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.22.18	“Son of man, the people of Israel are the worthless slag that remains after silver is smelted. They are the dross that is left over—a useless mixture of copper, tin, iron, and lead. 
EZK.22.19	So tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.22.20	Just as silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin are melted down in a furnace, I will melt you down in the heat of my fury. 
EZK.22.21	I will gather you together and blow the fire of my anger upon you, 
EZK.22.22	and you will melt like silver in fierce heat. Then you will know that I, the 
EZK.22.23	Again a message came to me from the 
EZK.22.24	“Son of man, give the people of Israel this message: In the day of my indignation, you will be like a polluted land, a land without rain. 
EZK.22.25	Your princes
EZK.22.26	Your priests have violated my instructions and defiled my holy things. They make no distinction between what is holy and what is not. And they do not teach my people the difference between what is ceremonially clean and unclean. They disregard my Sabbath days so that I am dishonored among them. 
EZK.22.27	Your leaders are like wolves who tear apart their victims. They actually destroy people’s lives for money! 
EZK.22.28	And your prophets cover up for them by announcing false visions and making lying predictions. They say, ‘My message is from the Sovereign 
EZK.22.29	Even common people oppress the poor, rob the needy, and deprive foreigners of justice.
EZK.22.30	“I looked for someone who might rebuild the wall of righteousness that guards the land. I searched for someone to stand in the gap in the wall so I wouldn’t have to destroy the land, but I found no one. 
EZK.22.31	So now I will pour out my fury on them, consuming them with the fire of my anger. I will heap on their heads the full penalty for all their sins. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.23.1	This message came to me from the 
EZK.23.2	“Son of man, once there were two sisters who were daughters of the same mother. 
EZK.23.3	They became prostitutes in Egypt. Even as young girls, they allowed men to fondle their breasts. 
EZK.23.4	The older girl was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. I married them, and they bore me sons and daughters. I am speaking of Samaria and Jerusalem, for Oholah is Samaria and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
EZK.23.5	“Then Oholah lusted after other lovers instead of me, and she gave her love to the Assyrian officers. 
EZK.23.6	They were all attractive young men, captains and commanders dressed in handsome blue, charioteers driving their horses. 
EZK.23.7	And so she prostituted herself with the most desirable men of Assyria, worshiping their idols
EZK.23.8	For when she left Egypt, she did not leave her spirit of prostitution behind. She was still as lewd as in her youth, when the Egyptians slept with her, fondled her breasts, and used her as a prostitute.
EZK.23.9	“And so I handed her over to her Assyrian lovers, whom she desired so much. 
EZK.23.10	They stripped her, took away her children as their slaves, and then killed her. After she received her punishment, her reputation was known to every woman in the land.
EZK.23.11	“Yet even though Oholibah saw what had happened to Oholah, her sister, she followed right in her footsteps. And she was even more depraved, abandoning herself to her lust and prostitution. 
EZK.23.12	She fawned over all the Assyrian officers—those captains and commanders in handsome uniforms, those charioteers driving their horses—all of them attractive young men. 
EZK.23.13	I saw the way she was going, defiling herself just like her older sister.
EZK.23.14	“Then she carried her prostitution even further. She fell in love with pictures that were painted on a wall—pictures of Babylonian
EZK.23.15	Handsome belts encircled their waists, and flowing turbans crowned their heads. They were dressed like chariot officers from the land of Babylonia.
EZK.23.16	When she saw these paintings, she longed to give herself to them, so she sent messengers to Babylonia to invite them to come to her. 
EZK.23.17	So they came and committed adultery with her, defiling her in the bed of love. After being defiled, however, she rejected them in disgust.
EZK.23.18	“In the same way, I became disgusted with Oholibah and rejected her, just as I had rejected her sister, because she flaunted herself before them and gave herself to satisfy their lusts. 
EZK.23.19	Yet she turned to even greater prostitution, remembering her youth when she was a prostitute in Egypt. 
EZK.23.20	She lusted after lovers with genitals as large as a donkey’s and emissions like those of a horse. 
EZK.23.21	And so, Oholibah, you relived your former days as a young girl in Egypt, when you first allowed your breasts to be fondled.
EZK.23.22	“Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.23	For the Babylonians will come with all the Chaldeans from Pekod and Shoa and Koa. And all the Assyrians will come with them—handsome young captains, commanders, chariot officers, and other high-ranking officers, all riding their horses. 
EZK.23.24	They will all come against you from the north
EZK.23.25	I will turn my jealous anger against you, and they will deal harshly with you. They will cut off your nose and ears, and any survivors will then be slaughtered by the sword. Your children will be taken away as captives, and everything that is left will be burned. 
EZK.23.26	They will strip you of your beautiful clothes and jewels. 
EZK.23.27	In this way, I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you brought from Egypt. You will never again cast longing eyes on those things or fondly remember your time in Egypt.
EZK.23.28	“For this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.29	They will treat you with hatred and rob you of all you own, leaving you stark naked. The shame of your prostitution will be exposed to all the world. 
EZK.23.30	You brought all this on yourself by prostituting yourself to other nations, defiling yourself with all their idols. 
EZK.23.31	Because you have followed in your sister’s footsteps, I will force you to drink the same cup of terror she drank.
EZK.23.32	“Yes, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.32	“You will drink from your sister’s cup of terror,
EZK.23.32	a cup that is large and deep.
EZK.23.32	It is filled to the brim
EZK.23.32	with scorn and derision.
EZK.23.33	Drunkenness and anguish will fill you,
EZK.23.33	for your cup is filled to the brim with distress and desolation,
EZK.23.33	the same cup your sister Samaria drank.
EZK.23.34	You will drain that cup of terror
EZK.23.34	to the very bottom.
EZK.23.34	Then you will smash it to pieces
EZK.23.34	and beat your breast in anguish.
EZK.23.34	I, the Sovereign 
EZK.23.35	“And because you have forgotten me and turned your back on me, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.37	They have committed both adultery and murder—adultery by worshiping idols and murder by burning as sacrifices the children they bore to me. 
EZK.23.38	Furthermore, they have defiled my Temple and violated my Sabbath day! 
EZK.23.39	On the very day that they sacrificed their children to their idols, they boldly came into my Temple to worship! They came in and defiled my house.
EZK.23.40	“You sisters sent messengers to distant lands to get men. Then when they arrived, you bathed yourselves, painted your eyelids, and put on your finest jewels for them. 
EZK.23.41	You sat with them on a beautifully embroidered couch and put my incense and my special oil on a table that was spread before you. 
EZK.23.42	From your room came the sound of many men carousing. They were lustful men and drunkards
EZK.23.43	Then I said, ‘If they really want to have sex with old worn-out prostitutes like these, let them!’ 
EZK.23.44	And that is what they did. They had sex with Oholah and Oholibah, these shameless prostitutes. 
EZK.23.45	But righteous people will judge these sister cities for what they really are—adulterers and murderers.
EZK.23.46	“Now this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.23.47	For their enemies will stone them and kill them with swords. They will butcher their sons and daughters and burn their homes. 
EZK.23.48	In this way, I will put an end to lewdness and idolatry in the land, and my judgment will be a warning to all women not to follow your wicked example. 
EZK.23.49	You will be fully repaid for all your prostitution—your worship of idols. Yes, you will suffer the full penalty. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign 
EZK.24.1	On January 15,
EZK.24.2	“Son of man, write down today’s date, because on this very day the king of Babylon is beginning his attack against Jerusalem. 
EZK.24.3	Then give these rebels an illustration with this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.24.3	“Put a pot on the fire,
EZK.24.3	and pour in some water.
EZK.24.4	Fill it with choice pieces of meat—
EZK.24.4	the rump and the shoulder
EZK.24.4	and all the most tender cuts.
EZK.24.5	Use only the best sheep from the flock,
EZK.24.5	and heap fuel on the fire beneath the pot.
EZK.24.5	Bring the pot to a boil,
EZK.24.5	and cook the bones along with the meat.
EZK.24.6	“Now this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.24.6	What sorrow awaits Jerusalem,
EZK.24.6	the city of murderers!
EZK.24.6	She is a cooking pot
EZK.24.6	whose corruption can’t be cleaned out.
EZK.24.6	Take the meat out in random order,
EZK.24.6	for no piece is better than another.
EZK.24.7	For the blood of her murders
EZK.24.7	is splashed on the rocks.
EZK.24.7	It isn’t even spilled on the ground,
EZK.24.7	where the dust could cover it!
EZK.24.8	So I will splash her blood on a rock
EZK.24.8	for all to see,
EZK.24.8	an expression of my anger
EZK.24.8	and vengeance against her.
EZK.24.9	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.24.9	What sorrow awaits Jerusalem,
EZK.24.9	the city of murderers!
EZK.24.9	I myself will pile up the fuel beneath her.
EZK.24.10	Yes, heap on the wood!
EZK.24.10	Let the fire roar to make the pot boil.
EZK.24.10	Cook the meat with many spices,
EZK.24.10	and afterward burn the bones.
EZK.24.11	Now set the empty pot on the coals.
EZK.24.11	Heat it red hot!
EZK.24.11	Burn away the filth and corruption.
EZK.24.12	But it’s hopeless;
EZK.24.12	the corruption can’t be cleaned out.
EZK.24.12	So throw it into the fire.
EZK.24.13	Your impurity is your lewdness
EZK.24.13	and the corruption of your idolatry.
EZK.24.13	I tried to cleanse you,
EZK.24.13	but you refused.
EZK.24.13	So now you will remain in your filth
EZK.24.13	until my fury against you has been satisfied.
EZK.24.14	“I, the 
EZK.24.15	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.24.16	“Son of man, with one blow I will take away your dearest treasure. Yet you must not show any sorrow at her death. Do not weep; let there be no tears. 
EZK.24.17	Groan silently, but let there be no wailing at her grave. Do not uncover your head or take off your sandals. Do not perform the usual rituals of mourning or accept any food brought to you by consoling friends.”
EZK.24.18	So I proclaimed this to the people the next morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did everything I had been told to do. 
EZK.24.19	Then the people asked, “What does all this mean? What are you trying to tell us?”
EZK.24.20	So I said to them, “A message came to me from the 
EZK.24.21	and I was told to give this message to the people of Israel. This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.24.22	Then you will do as Ezekiel has done. You will not mourn in public or console yourselves by eating the food brought by friends. 
EZK.24.23	Your heads will remain covered, and your sandals will not be taken off. You will not mourn or weep, but you will waste away because of your sins. You will groan among yourselves for all the evil you have done. 
EZK.24.24	Ezekiel is an example for you; you will do just as he has done. And when that time comes, you will know that I am the Sovereign 
EZK.24.25	Then the 
EZK.24.26	And on that day a survivor from Jerusalem will come to you in Babylon and tell you what has happened. 
EZK.24.27	And when he arrives, your voice will suddenly return so you can talk to him, and you will be a symbol for these people. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.25.1	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.25.2	“Son of man, turn and face the land of Ammon and prophesy against its people. 
EZK.25.3	Give the Ammonites this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.25.4	I will allow nomads from the eastern deserts to overrun your country. They will set up their camps among you and pitch their tents on your land. They will harvest all your fruit and drink the milk from your livestock. 
EZK.25.5	And I will turn the city of Rabbah into a pasture for camels, and all the land of the Ammonites into a resting place for sheep and goats. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.25.6	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.25.7	I will raise my fist of judgment against you. I will give you as plunder to many nations. I will cut you off from being a nation and destroy you completely. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.25.8	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.25.9	I will open up their eastern flank and wipe out their glorious frontier towns—Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim. 
EZK.25.10	And I will hand Moab over to nomads from the eastern deserts, just as I handed over Ammon. Yes, the Ammonites will no longer be counted among the nations. 
EZK.25.11	In the same way, I will bring my judgment down on the Moabites. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.25.12	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.25.13	Therefore, says the Sovereign 
EZK.25.14	I will accomplish this by the hand of my people of Israel. They will carry out my vengeance with anger, and Edom will know that this vengeance is from me. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.25.15	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.25.16	Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.25.17	I will execute terrible vengeance against them to punish them for what they have done. And when I have inflicted my revenge, they will know that I am the 
EZK.26.1	On February 3, during the twelfth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity,
EZK.26.2	“Son of man, Tyre has rejoiced over the fall of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Ha! She who was the gateway to the rich trade routes to the east has been broken, and I am the heir! Because she has been made desolate, I will become wealthy!’
EZK.26.3	“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.26.4	They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down its towers. I will scrape away its soil and make it a bare rock! 
EZK.26.5	It will be just a rock in the sea, a place for fishermen to spread their nets, for I have spoken, says the Sovereign 
EZK.26.6	and its mainland villages will be destroyed by the sword. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.26.7	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.26.8	First he will destroy your mainland villages. Then he will attack you by building a siege wall, constructing a ramp, and raising a roof of shields against you. 
EZK.26.9	He will pound your walls with battering rams and demolish your towers with sledgehammers. 
EZK.26.10	The hooves of his horses will choke the city with dust, and the noise of the charioteers and chariot wheels will shake your walls as they storm through your broken gates. 
EZK.26.11	His horsemen will trample through every street in the city. They will butcher your people, and your strong pillars will topple.
EZK.26.12	“They will plunder all your riches and merchandise and break down your walls. They will destroy your lovely homes and dump your stones and timbers and even your dust into the sea. 
EZK.26.13	I will stop the music of your songs. No more will the sound of harps be heard among your people. 
EZK.26.14	I will make your island a bare rock, a place for fishermen to spread their nets. You will never be rebuilt, for I, the 
EZK.26.15	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.26.16	All the seaport rulers will step down from their thrones and take off their royal robes and beautiful clothing. They will sit on the ground trembling with horror at your destruction. 
EZK.26.17	Then they will wail for you, singing this funeral song: 
EZK.26.17	“O famous island city,
EZK.26.17	once ruler of the sea,
EZK.26.17	how you have been destroyed!
EZK.26.17	Your people, with their naval power,
EZK.26.17	once spread fear around the world.
EZK.26.18	Now the coastlands tremble at your fall.
EZK.26.18	The islands are dismayed as you disappear.
EZK.26.19	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.26.20	I will send you to the pit to join those who descended there long ago. Your city will lie in ruins, buried beneath the earth, like those in the pit who have entered the world of the dead. You will have no place of respect here in the land of the living. 
EZK.26.21	I will bring you to a terrible end, and you will exist no more. You will be looked for, but you will never again be found. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.27.1	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.27.2	“Son of man, sing a funeral song for Tyre, 
EZK.27.3	that mighty gateway to the sea, the trading center of the world. Give Tyre this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.27.3	“You boasted, O Tyre,
EZK.27.3	‘My beauty is perfect!’
EZK.27.4	You extended your boundaries into the sea.
EZK.27.4	Your builders made your beauty perfect.
EZK.27.5	You were like a great ship
EZK.27.5	built of the finest cypress from Senir.
EZK.27.5	They took a cedar from Lebanon
EZK.27.5	to make a mast for you.
EZK.27.6	They carved your oars
EZK.27.6	from the oaks of Bashan.
EZK.27.6	Your deck of pine from the coasts of Cyprus
EZK.27.6	was inlaid with ivory.
EZK.27.7	Your sails were made of Egypt’s finest linen,
EZK.27.7	and they flew as a banner above you.
EZK.27.7	You stood beneath blue and purple awnings
EZK.27.7	made bright with dyes from the coasts of Elishah.
EZK.27.8	Your oarsmen came from Sidon and Arvad;
EZK.27.8	your helmsmen were skilled men from Tyre itself.
EZK.27.9	Wise old craftsmen from Gebal did the caulking.
EZK.27.9	Ships from every land came with goods to barter for your trade.
EZK.27.10	“Men from distant Persia, Lydia, and Libya
EZK.27.11	Men from Arvad and Helech stood on your walls. Your towers were manned by men from Gammad. Their shields hung on your walls, completing your beauty.
EZK.27.12	“Tarshish sent merchants to buy your wares in exchange for silver, iron, tin, and lead. 
EZK.27.13	Merchants from Greece,
EZK.27.14	“From Beth-togarmah came riding horses, chariot horses, and mules, all in exchange for your goods. 
EZK.27.15	Merchants came to you from Dedan.
EZK.27.16	“Syria
EZK.27.17	Judah and Israel traded for your wares, offering wheat from Minnith, figs,
EZK.27.18	“Damascus sent merchants to buy your rich variety of goods, bringing wine from Helbon and white wool from Zahar. 
EZK.27.19	Greeks from Uzal
EZK.27.20	“Dedan sent merchants to trade their expensive saddle blankets with you. 
EZK.27.21	The Arabians and the princes of Kedar sent merchants to trade lambs and rams and male goats in exchange for your goods. 
EZK.27.22	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah came with all kinds of spices, jewels, and gold in exchange for your wares.
EZK.27.23	“Haran, Canneh, Eden, Sheba, Asshur, and Kilmad came with their merchandise, too. 
EZK.27.24	They brought choice fabrics to trade—blue cloth, embroidery, and multicolored carpets rolled up and bound with cords. 
EZK.27.25	The ships of Tarshish were your ocean caravans. Your island warehouse was filled to the brim!
EZK.27.26	“But look! Your oarsmen
EZK.27.26	have taken you into stormy seas!
EZK.27.26	A mighty eastern gale
EZK.27.26	has wrecked you in the heart of the sea!
EZK.27.27	Everything is lost—
EZK.27.27	your riches and wares,
EZK.27.27	your sailors and pilots,
EZK.27.27	your ship builders, merchants, and warriors.
EZK.27.27	On the day of your ruin,
EZK.27.27	everyone on board sinks into the depths of the sea.
EZK.27.28	Your cities by the sea tremble
EZK.27.28	as your pilots cry out in terror.
EZK.27.29	All the oarsmen abandon their ships;
EZK.27.29	the sailors and pilots stand on the shore.
EZK.27.30	They cry aloud over you
EZK.27.30	and weep bitterly.
EZK.27.30	They throw dust on their heads
EZK.27.30	and roll in ashes.
EZK.27.31	They shave their heads in grief for you
EZK.27.31	and dress themselves in burlap.
EZK.27.31	They weep for you with bitter anguish
EZK.27.31	and deep mourning.
EZK.27.32	As they wail and mourn over you,
EZK.27.32	they sing this sad funeral song:
EZK.27.32	‘Was there ever such a city as Tyre,
EZK.27.32	now silent at the bottom of the sea?
EZK.27.33	The merchandise you traded
EZK.27.33	satisfied the desires of many nations.
EZK.27.33	Kings at the ends of the earth
EZK.27.33	were enriched by your trade.
EZK.27.34	Now you are a wrecked ship,
EZK.27.34	broken at the bottom of the sea.
EZK.27.34	All your merchandise and crew
EZK.27.34	have gone down with you.
EZK.27.35	All who live along the coastlands
EZK.27.35	are appalled at your terrible fate.
EZK.27.35	Their kings are filled with horror
EZK.27.35	and look on with twisted faces.
EZK.27.36	The merchants among the nations
EZK.27.36	shake their heads at the sight of you,
EZK.27.36	for you have come to a horrible end
EZK.27.36	and will exist no more.’”
EZK.28.1	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.28.2	“Son of man, give the prince of Tyre this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.28.2	“In your great pride you claim, ‘I am a god!
EZK.28.2	I sit on a divine throne in the heart of the sea.’
EZK.28.2	But you are only a man and not a god,
EZK.28.2	though you boast that you are a god.
EZK.28.3	You regard yourself as wiser than Daniel
EZK.28.3	and think no secret is hidden from you.
EZK.28.4	With your wisdom and understanding you have amassed great wealth—
EZK.28.4	gold and silver for your treasuries.
EZK.28.5	Yes, your wisdom has made you very rich,
EZK.28.5	and your riches have made you very proud.
EZK.28.6	“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.28.6	Because you think you are as wise as a god,
EZK.28.7	I will now bring against you a foreign army,
EZK.28.7	the terror of the nations.
EZK.28.7	They will draw their swords against your marvelous wisdom
EZK.28.7	and defile your splendor!
EZK.28.8	They will bring you down to the pit,
EZK.28.8	and you will die in the heart of the sea,
EZK.28.8	pierced with many wounds.
EZK.28.9	Will you then boast, ‘I am a god!’
EZK.28.9	to those who kill you?
EZK.28.9	To them you will be no god
EZK.28.9	but merely a man!
EZK.28.10	You will die like an outcast
EZK.28.10	at the hands of foreigners.
EZK.28.10	I, the Sovereign 
EZK.28.11	Then this further message came to me from the 
EZK.28.12	“Son of man, sing this funeral song for the king of Tyre. Give him this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.28.12	“You were the model of perfection,
EZK.28.12	full of wisdom and exquisite in beauty.
EZK.28.13	You were in Eden,
EZK.28.13	the garden of God.
EZK.28.13	Your clothing was adorned with every precious stone
EZK.28.13	red carnelian, pale-green peridot, white moonstone,
EZK.28.13	blue-green beryl, onyx, green jasper,
EZK.28.13	blue lapis lazuli, turquoise, and emerald—
EZK.28.13	all beautifully crafted for you
EZK.28.13	and set in the finest gold.
EZK.28.13	They were given to you
EZK.28.13	on the day you were created.
EZK.28.14	I ordained and anointed you
EZK.28.14	as the mighty angelic guardian.
EZK.28.14	You had access to the holy mountain of God
EZK.28.14	and walked among the stones of fire.
EZK.28.15	“You were blameless in all you did
EZK.28.15	from the day you were created
EZK.28.15	until the day evil was found in you.
EZK.28.16	Your rich commerce led you to violence,
EZK.28.16	and you sinned.
EZK.28.16	So I banished you in disgrace
EZK.28.16	from the mountain of God.
EZK.28.16	I expelled you, O mighty guardian,
EZK.28.16	from your place among the stones of fire.
EZK.28.17	Your heart was filled with pride
EZK.28.17	because of all your beauty.
EZK.28.17	Your wisdom was corrupted
EZK.28.17	by your love of splendor.
EZK.28.17	So I threw you to the ground
EZK.28.17	and exposed you to the curious gaze of kings.
EZK.28.18	You defiled your sanctuaries
EZK.28.18	with your many sins and your dishonest trade.
EZK.28.18	So I brought fire out from within you,
EZK.28.18	and it consumed you.
EZK.28.18	I reduced you to ashes on the ground
EZK.28.18	in the sight of all who were watching.
EZK.28.19	All who knew you are appalled at your fate.
EZK.28.19	You have come to a terrible end,
EZK.28.19	and you will exist no more.”
EZK.28.20	Then another message came to me from the 
EZK.28.21	“Son of man, turn and face the city of Sidon and prophesy against it. 
EZK.28.22	Give the people of Sidon this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.28.22	“I am your enemy, O Sidon,
EZK.28.22	and I will reveal my glory by what I do to you.

EZK.28.22	everyone watching will know
EZK.28.22	that I am the 
EZK.28.23	I will send a plague against you,
EZK.28.23	and blood will be spilled in your streets.
EZK.28.23	The attack will come from every direction,
EZK.28.23	and your people will lie slaughtered within your walls.
EZK.28.23	Then everyone will know
EZK.28.23	that I am the 
EZK.28.24	No longer will Israel’s scornful neighbors
EZK.28.24	prick and tear at her like briers and thorns.

EZK.29.1	On January 7,
EZK.29.2	“Son of man, turn and face Egypt and prophesy against Pharaoh the king and all the people of Egypt. 
EZK.29.3	Give them this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.29.3	“I am your enemy, O Pharaoh, king of Egypt—
EZK.29.3	you great monster, lurking in the streams of the Nile.
EZK.29.3	For you have said, ‘The Nile River is mine;
EZK.29.3	I made it for myself.’
EZK.29.4	I will put hooks in your jaws
EZK.29.4	and drag you out on the land
EZK.29.4	with fish sticking to your scales.
EZK.29.5	I will leave you and all your fish
EZK.29.5	stranded in the wilderness to die.
EZK.29.5	You will lie unburied on the open ground,
EZK.29.5	for I have given you as food to the wild animals and birds.
EZK.29.6	All the people of Egypt will know that I am the 
EZK.29.6	for to Israel you were just a staff made of reeds.
EZK.29.7	When Israel leaned on you,
EZK.29.7	you splintered and broke
EZK.29.7	and stabbed her in the armpit.
EZK.29.7	When she put her weight on you,
EZK.29.7	you collapsed, and her legs gave way.
EZK.29.8	“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.29.9	The land of Egypt will become a desolate wasteland, and the Egyptians will know that I am the 
EZK.29.9	“Because you said, ‘The Nile River is mine; I made it,’ 
EZK.29.10	I am now the enemy of both you and your river. I will make the land of Egypt a totally desolate wasteland, from Migdol to Aswan, as far south as the border of Ethiopia.
EZK.29.11	For forty years not a soul will pass that way, neither people nor animals. It will be completely uninhabited. 
EZK.29.12	I will make Egypt desolate, and it will be surrounded by other desolate nations. Its cities will be empty and desolate for forty years, surrounded by other ruined cities. I will scatter the Egyptians to distant lands.
EZK.29.13	“But this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.29.14	I will restore the prosperity of Egypt and bring its people back to the land of Pathros in southern Egypt from which they came. But Egypt will remain an unimportant, minor kingdom. 
EZK.29.15	It will be the lowliest of all the nations, never again great enough to rise above its neighbors.
EZK.29.16	“Then Israel will no longer be tempted to trust in Egypt for help. Egypt’s shattered condition will remind Israel of how sinful she was to trust Egypt in earlier days. Then Israel will know that I am the Sovereign

EZK.30.11	will be sent to demolish the land.
EZK.30.11	They will make war against Egypt
EZK.30.11	until slaughtered Egyptians cover the ground.
EZK.30.12	I will dry up the Nile River
EZK.30.12	and sell the land to wicked men.
EZK.30.12	I will destroy the land of Egypt and everything in it

EZK.30.18	A dark cloud will cover Tahpanhes,

EZK.30.21	“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. His arm has not been put in a cast so that it may heal. Neither has it been bound up with a splint to make it strong enough to hold a sword. 
EZK.30.22	Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.30.23	I will scatter the Egyptians to many lands throughout the world. 
EZK.30.24	I will strengthen the arms of Babylon’s king and put my sword in his hand. But I will break the arms of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he will lie there mortally wounded, groaning in pain. 
EZK.30.25	I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, while the arms of Pharaoh fall useless to his sides. And when I put my sword in the hand of Babylon’s king and he brings it against the land of Egypt, Egypt will know that I am the 
EZK.30.26	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, dispersing them throughout the earth. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.31.1	On June 21,
EZK.31.2	“Son of man, give this message to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and all his hordes:
EZK.31.2	“To whom would you compare your greatness?
EZK.31.3	You are like mighty Assyria,
EZK.31.3	which was once like a cedar of Lebanon,
EZK.31.3	with beautiful branches that cast deep forest shade
EZK.31.3	and with its top high among the clouds.
EZK.31.4	Deep springs watered it
EZK.31.4	and helped it to grow tall and luxuriant.
EZK.31.4	The water flowed around it like a river,
EZK.31.4	streaming to all the trees nearby.
EZK.31.5	This great tree towered high,
EZK.31.5	higher than all the other trees around it.
EZK.31.5	It prospered and grew long thick branches
EZK.31.5	because of all the water at its roots.
EZK.31.6	The birds nested in its branches,
EZK.31.6	and in its shade all the wild animals gave birth.
EZK.31.6	All the great nations of the world
EZK.31.6	lived in its shadow.
EZK.31.7	It was strong and beautiful,
EZK.31.7	with wide-spreading branches,
EZK.31.7	for its roots went deep
EZK.31.7	into abundant water.
EZK.31.8	No other cedar in the garden of God
EZK.31.8	could rival it.
EZK.31.8	No cypress had branches to equal it;
EZK.31.8	no plane tree had boughs to compare.
EZK.31.8	No tree in the garden of God
EZK.31.8	came close to it in beauty.
EZK.31.9	Because I made this tree so beautiful,
EZK.31.9	and gave it such magnificent foliage,
EZK.31.9	it was the envy of all the other trees of Eden,
EZK.31.9	the garden of God.
EZK.31.10	“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.31.11	I will hand it over to a mighty nation that will destroy it as its wickedness deserves. I have already discarded it. 
EZK.31.12	A foreign army—the terror of the nations—has cut it down and left it fallen on the ground. Its branches are scattered across the mountains and valleys and ravines of the land. All those who lived in its shadow have gone away and left it lying there.
EZK.31.13	“The birds roost on its fallen trunk,
EZK.31.13	and the wild animals lie among its branches.
EZK.31.14	Let the tree of no other nation
EZK.31.14	proudly exult in its own prosperity,
EZK.31.14	though it be higher than the clouds
EZK.31.14	and it be watered from the depths.
EZK.31.14	For all are doomed to die,
EZK.31.14	to go down to the depths of the earth.
EZK.31.14	They will land in the pit
EZK.31.14	along with everyone else on earth.
EZK.31.15	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.31.16	I made the nations shake with fear at the sound of its fall, for I sent it down to the grave with all the others who descend to the pit. And all the other proud trees of Eden, the most beautiful and the best of Lebanon, the ones whose roots went deep into the water, took comfort to find it there with them in the depths of the earth. 
EZK.31.17	Its allies, too, were all destroyed and had passed away. They had gone down to the grave—all those nations that had lived in its shade.
EZK.31.18	“O Egypt, to which of the trees of Eden will you compare your strength and glory? You, too, will be brought down to the depths with all these other nations. You will lie there among the outcasts
EZK.32.1	On March 3,
EZK.32.2	“Son of man, mourn for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and give him this message:
EZK.32.2	“You think of yourself as a strong young lion among the nations,
EZK.32.2	but you are really just a sea monster,
EZK.32.2	heaving around in your own rivers,
EZK.32.2	stirring up mud with your feet.
EZK.32.3	Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.32.3	I will send many people
EZK.32.3	to catch you in my net
EZK.32.3	and haul you out of the water.
EZK.32.4	I will leave you stranded on the land to die.
EZK.32.4	All the birds of the heavens will land on you,
EZK.32.4	and the wild animals of the whole earth
EZK.32.4	will gorge themselves on you.
EZK.32.5	I will scatter your flesh on the hills
EZK.32.5	and fill the valleys with your bones.
EZK.32.6	I will drench the earth with your gushing blood
EZK.32.6	all the way to the mountains,
EZK.32.6	filling the ravines to the brim.
EZK.32.7	When I blot you out,
EZK.32.7	I will veil the heavens and darken the stars.
EZK.32.7	I will cover the sun with a cloud,
EZK.32.7	and the moon will not give you its light.
EZK.32.8	I will darken the bright stars overhead
EZK.32.8	and cover your land in darkness.
EZK.32.8	I, the Sovereign 
EZK.32.9	“I will disturb many hearts when I bring news of your downfall to distant nations you have never seen. 
EZK.32.10	Yes, I will shock many lands, and their kings will be terrified at your fate. They will shudder in fear for their lives as I brandish my sword before them on the day of your fall. 
EZK.32.11	For this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.32.11	“The sword of the king of Babylon
EZK.32.11	will come against you.
EZK.32.12	I will destroy your hordes with the swords of mighty warriors—
EZK.32.12	the terror of the nations.
EZK.32.12	They will shatter the pride of Egypt,
EZK.32.12	and all its hordes will be destroyed.
EZK.32.13	I will destroy all your flocks and herds
EZK.32.13	that graze beside the streams.
EZK.32.13	Never again will people or animals
EZK.32.13	muddy those waters with their feet.
EZK.32.14	Then I will let the waters of Egypt become calm again,
EZK.32.14	and they will flow as smoothly as olive oil,
EZK.32.14	says the Sovereign 
EZK.32.15	And when I destroy Egypt
EZK.32.15	and strip you of everything you own
EZK.32.15	and strike down all your people,
EZK.32.15	then you will know that I am the 
EZK.32.16	Yes, this is the funeral song
EZK.32.16	they will sing for Egypt.
EZK.32.16	Let all the nations mourn.
EZK.32.16	Let them mourn for Egypt and its hordes.
EZK.32.16	I, the Sovereign 
EZK.32.17	On March 17,
EZK.32.18	“Son of man, weep for the hordes of Egypt and for the other mighty nations.
EZK.32.19	Say to them,
EZK.32.19	‘O Egypt, are you lovelier than the other nations?
EZK.32.19	No! So go down to the pit and lie there among the outcasts.
EZK.32.20	The Egyptians will fall with the many who have died by the sword, for the sword is drawn against them. Egypt and its hordes will be dragged away to their judgment. 
EZK.32.21	Down in the grave
EZK.32.22	“Assyria lies there surrounded by the graves of its army, those who were slaughtered by the sword. 
EZK.32.23	Their graves are in the depths of the pit, and they are surrounded by their allies. They struck terror in the hearts of people everywhere, but now they have been slaughtered by the sword.
EZK.32.24	“Elam lies there surrounded by the graves of all its hordes, those who were slaughtered by the sword. They struck terror in the hearts of people everywhere, but now they have descended as outcasts to the world below. Now they lie in the pit and share the shame of those who have gone before them. 
EZK.32.25	They have a resting place among the slaughtered, surrounded by the graves of all their hordes. Yes, they terrorized the nations while they lived, but now they lie in shame with others in the pit, all of them outcasts, slaughtered by the sword.
EZK.32.26	“Meshech and Tubal are there, surrounded by the graves of all their hordes. They once struck terror in the hearts of people everywhere. But now they are outcasts, all slaughtered by the sword. 
EZK.32.27	They are not buried in honor like their fallen heroes, who went down to the grave
EZK.32.28	“You too, Egypt, will lie crushed and broken among the outcasts, all slaughtered by the sword.
EZK.32.29	“Edom is there with its kings and princes. Mighty as they were, they also lie among those slaughtered by the sword, with the outcasts who have gone down to the pit.
EZK.32.30	“All the princes of the north and the Sidonians are there with others who have died. Once a terror, they have been put to shame. They lie there as outcasts with others who were slaughtered by the sword. They share the shame of all who have descended to the pit.
EZK.32.31	“When Pharaoh and his entire army arrive, he will take comfort that he is not alone in having his hordes killed, says the Sovereign 
EZK.32.32	Although I have caused his terror to fall upon all the living, Pharaoh and his hordes will lie there among the outcasts who were slaughtered by the sword. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.33.1	Once again a message came to me from the 
EZK.33.2	“Son of man, give your people this message: ‘When I bring an army against a country, the people of that land choose one of their own to be a watchman. 
EZK.33.3	When the watchman sees the enemy coming, he sounds the alarm to warn the people. 
EZK.33.4	Then if those who hear the alarm refuse to take action, it is their own fault if they die. 
EZK.33.5	They heard the alarm but ignored it, so the responsibility is theirs. If they had listened to the warning, they could have saved their lives. 
EZK.33.6	But if the watchman sees the enemy coming and doesn’t sound the alarm to warn the people, he is responsible for their captivity. They will die in their sins, but I will hold the watchman responsible for their deaths.’
EZK.33.7	“Now, son of man, I am making you a watchman for the people of Israel. Therefore, listen to what I say and warn them for me. 
EZK.33.8	If I announce that some wicked people are sure to die and you fail to tell them to change their ways, then they will die in their sins, and I will hold you responsible for their deaths. 
EZK.33.9	But if you warn them to repent and they don’t repent, they will die in their sins, but you will have saved yourself.
EZK.33.10	“Son of man, give the people of Israel this message: You are saying, ‘Our sins are heavy upon us; we are wasting away! How can we survive?’ 
EZK.33.11	As surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.33.12	“Son of man, give your people this message: The righteous behavior of righteous people will not save them if they turn to sin, nor will the wicked behavior of wicked people destroy them if they repent and turn from their sins. 
EZK.33.13	When I tell righteous people that they will live, but then they sin, expecting their past righteousness to save them, then none of their righteous acts will be remembered. I will destroy them for their sins. 
EZK.33.14	And suppose I tell some wicked people that they will surely die, but then they turn from their sins and do what is just and right. 
EZK.33.15	For instance, they might give back a debtor’s security, return what they have stolen, and obey my life-giving laws, no longer doing what is evil. If they do this, then they will surely live and not die. 
EZK.33.16	None of their past sins will be brought up again, for they have done what is just and right, and they will surely live.
EZK.33.17	“Your people are saying, ‘The Lord isn’t doing what’s right,’ but it is they who are not doing what’s right. 
EZK.33.18	For again I say, when righteous people turn away from their righteous behavior and turn to evil, they will die. 
EZK.33.19	But if wicked people turn from their wickedness and do what is just and right, they will live. 
EZK.33.20	O people of Israel, you are saying, ‘The Lord isn’t doing what’s right.’ But I judge each of you according to your deeds.”
EZK.33.21	On January 8,
EZK.33.22	The previous evening the 
EZK.33.23	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.33.24	“Son of man, the scattered remnants of Israel living among the ruined cities keep saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he gained possession of the entire land. We are many; surely the land has been given to us as a possession.’ 
EZK.33.25	So tell these people, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.33.26	Murderers! Idolaters! Adulterers! Should the land belong to you?’
EZK.33.27	“Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.33.28	I will completely destroy the land and demolish her pride. Her arrogant power will come to an end. The mountains of Israel will be so desolate that no one will even travel through them. 
EZK.33.29	When I have completely destroyed the land because of their detestable sins, then they will know that I am the 
EZK.33.30	“Son of man, your people talk about you in their houses and whisper about you at the doors. They say to each other, ‘Come on, let’s go hear the prophet tell us what the 
EZK.33.31	So my people come pretending to be sincere and sit before you. They listen to your words, but they have no intention of doing what you say. Their mouths are full of lustful words, and their hearts seek only after money. 
EZK.33.32	You are very entertaining to them, like someone who sings love songs with a beautiful voice or plays fine music on an instrument. They hear what you say, but they don’t act on it! 
EZK.33.33	But when all these terrible things happen to them—as they certainly will—then they will know a prophet has been among them.”
EZK.34.1	Then this message came to me from the 
EZK.34.2	“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds, the leaders of Israel. Give them this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.34.3	You drink the milk, wear the wool, and butcher the best animals, but you let your flocks starve. 
EZK.34.4	You have not taken care of the weak. You have not tended the sick or bound up the injured. You have not gone looking for those who have wandered away and are lost. Instead, you have ruled them with harshness and cruelty. 
EZK.34.5	So my sheep have been scattered without a shepherd, and they are easy prey for any wild animal. 
EZK.34.6	They have wandered through all the mountains and all the hills, across the face of the earth, yet no one has gone to search for them.
EZK.34.7	“Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.8	As surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.34.9	Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.10	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.34.11	“For this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.34.12	I will be like a shepherd looking for his scattered flock. I will find my sheep and rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on that dark and cloudy day. 
EZK.34.13	I will bring them back home to their own land of Israel from among the peoples and nations. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel and by the rivers and in all the places where people live. 
EZK.34.14	Yes, I will give them good pastureland on the high hills of Israel. There they will lie down in pleasant places and feed in the lush pastures of the hills. 
EZK.34.15	I myself will tend my sheep and give them a place to lie down in peace, says the Sovereign 
EZK.34.16	I will search for my lost ones who strayed away, and I will bring them safely home again. I will bandage the injured and strengthen the weak. But I will destroy those who are fat and powerful. I will feed them, yes—feed them justice!
EZK.34.17	“And as for you, my flock, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.34.18	Isn’t it enough for you to keep the best of the pastures for yourselves? Must you also trample down the rest? Isn’t it enough for you to drink clear water for yourselves? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? 
EZK.34.19	Why must my flock eat what you have trampled down and drink water you have fouled?
EZK.34.20	“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.34.21	For you fat sheep pushed and butted and crowded my sick and hungry flock until you scattered them to distant lands. 
EZK.34.22	So I will rescue my flock, and they will no longer be abused. I will judge between one animal of the flock and another. 
EZK.34.23	And I will set over them one shepherd, my servant David. He will feed them and be a shepherd to them. 
EZK.34.24	And I, the 
EZK.34.25	“I will make a covenant of peace with my people and drive away the dangerous animals from the land. Then they will be able to camp safely in the wildest places and sleep in the woods without fear. 
EZK.34.26	I will bless my people and their homes around my holy hill. And in the proper season I will send the showers they need. There will be showers of blessing. 
EZK.34.27	The orchards and fields of my people will yield bumper crops, and everyone will live in safety. When I have broken their chains of slavery and rescued them from those who enslaved them, then they will know that I am the 
EZK.34.28	They will no longer be prey for other nations, and wild animals will no longer devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will frighten them.
EZK.34.29	“And I will make their land famous for its crops, so my people will never again suffer from famines or the insults of foreign nations. 
EZK.34.30	In this way, they will know that I, the 
EZK.34.31	You are my flock, the sheep of my pasture. You are my people, and I am your God. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.35.1	Again a message came to me from the 
EZK.35.2	“Son of man, turn and face Mount Seir, and prophesy against its people. 
EZK.35.3	Give them this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.35.3	“I am your enemy, O Mount Seir,
EZK.35.3	and I will raise my fist against you
EZK.35.3	to destroy you completely.
EZK.35.4	I will demolish your cities
EZK.35.4	and make you desolate.
EZK.35.4	Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.35.5	“Your eternal hatred for the people of Israel led you to butcher them when they were helpless, when I had already punished them for all their sins. 
EZK.35.6	As surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.35.7	I will make Mount Seir utterly desolate, killing off all who try to escape and any who return. 
EZK.35.8	I will fill your mountains with the dead. Your hills, your valleys, and your ravines will be filled with people slaughtered by the sword. 
EZK.35.9	I will make you desolate forever. Your cities will never be rebuilt. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.35.10	“For you said, ‘The lands of Israel and Judah will be ours. We will take possession of them. What do we care that the 
EZK.35.11	Therefore, as surely as I live, says the Sovereign 
EZK.35.12	Then you will know that I, the 
EZK.35.13	In saying that, you boasted proudly against me, and I have heard it all!
EZK.35.14	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.35.15	You rejoiced at the desolation of Israel’s territory. Now I will rejoice at yours! You will be wiped out, you people of Mount Seir and all who live in Edom! Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.36.1	“Son of man, prophesy to Israel’s mountains. Give them this message: O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the 
EZK.36.2	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.3	Therefore, son of man, give the mountains of Israel this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.36.4	Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign 
EZK.36.5	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.6	“Therefore, prophesy to the hills and mountains, the ravines and valleys of Israel. This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.7	Therefore, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.8	“But the mountains of Israel will produce heavy crops of fruit for my people—for they will be coming home again soon! 
EZK.36.9	See, I care about you, and I will pay attention to you. Your ground will be plowed and your crops planted. 
EZK.36.10	I will greatly increase the population of Israel, and the ruined cities will be rebuilt and filled with people. 
EZK.36.11	I will increase not only the people, but also your animals. O mountains of Israel, I will bring people to live on you once again. I will make you even more prosperous than you were before. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.36.12	I will cause my people to walk on you once again, and you will be their territory. You will never again rob them of their children.
EZK.36.13	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.14	But you will never again devour your people or rob them of their children, says the Sovereign 
EZK.36.15	I will not let you hear those other nations insult you, and you will no longer be mocked by them. You will not be a land that causes its nation to fall, says the Sovereign 
EZK.36.16	Then this further message came to me from the 
EZK.36.17	“Son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own land, they defiled it by the evil way they lived. To me their conduct was as unclean as a woman’s menstrual cloth. 
EZK.36.18	They polluted the land with murder and the worship of idols,
EZK.36.19	I scattered them to many lands to punish them for the evil way they had lived. 
EZK.36.20	But when they were scattered among the nations, they brought shame on my holy name. For the nations said, ‘These are the people of the 
EZK.36.21	Then I was concerned for my holy name, on which my people brought shame among the nations.
EZK.36.22	“Therefore, give the people of Israel this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.36.23	I will show how holy my great name is—the name on which you brought shame among the nations. And when I reveal my holiness through you before their very eyes, says the Sovereign 
EZK.36.24	For I will gather you up from all the nations and bring you home again to your land.
EZK.36.25	“Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship idols. 
EZK.36.26	And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart.
EZK.36.27	And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.
EZK.36.28	“And you will live in Israel, the land I gave your ancestors long ago. You will be my people, and I will be your God. 
EZK.36.29	I will cleanse you of your filthy behavior. I will give you good crops of grain, and I will send no more famines on the land. 
EZK.36.30	I will give you great harvests from your fruit trees and fields, and never again will the surrounding nations be able to scoff at your land for its famines. 
EZK.36.31	Then you will remember your past sins and despise yourselves for all the detestable things you did. 
EZK.36.32	But remember, says the Sovereign 
EZK.36.33	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.34	The fields that used to lie empty and desolate in plain view of everyone will again be farmed. 
EZK.36.35	And when I bring you back, people will say, ‘This former wasteland is now like the Garden of Eden! The abandoned and ruined cities now have strong walls and are filled with people!’ 
EZK.36.36	Then the surrounding nations that survive will know that I, the 
EZK.36.37	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.36.38	They will be as numerous as the sacred flocks that fill Jerusalem’s streets at the time of her festivals. The ruined cities will be crowded with people once more, and everyone will know that I am the 
EZK.37.1	The 
EZK.37.2	He led me all around among the bones that covered the valley floor. They were scattered everywhere across the ground and were completely dried out. 
EZK.37.3	Then he asked me, “Son of man, can these bones become living people again?”
EZK.37.3	“O Sovereign 
EZK.37.4	Then he said to me, “Speak a prophetic message to these bones and say, ‘Dry bones, listen to the word of the 
EZK.37.5	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.37.6	I will put flesh and muscles on you and cover you with skin. I will put breath into you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.37.7	So I spoke this message, just as he told me. Suddenly as I spoke, there was a rattling noise all across the valley. The bones of each body came together and attached themselves as complete skeletons. 
EZK.37.8	Then as I watched, muscles and flesh formed over the bones. Then skin formed to cover their bodies, but they still had no breath in them.
EZK.37.9	Then he said to me, “Speak a prophetic message to the winds, son of man. Speak a prophetic message and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.37.10	So I spoke the message as he commanded me, and breath came into their bodies. They all came to life and stood up on their feet—a great army.
EZK.37.11	Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones represent the people of Israel. They are saying, ‘We have become old, dry bones—all hope is gone. Our nation is finished.’ 
EZK.37.12	Therefore, prophesy to them and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.37.13	When this happens, O my people, you will know that I am the 
EZK.37.14	I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live again and return home to your own land. Then you will know that I, the 
EZK.37.15	Again a message came to me from the 
EZK.37.16	“Son of man, take a piece of wood and carve on it these words: ‘This represents Judah and its allied tribes.’ Then take another piece and carve these words on it: ‘This represents Ephraim and the northern tribes of Israel.’
EZK.37.17	Now hold them together in your hand as if they were one piece of wood. 
EZK.37.18	When your people ask you what your actions mean, 
EZK.37.19	say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.37.20	“Then hold out the pieces of wood you have inscribed, so the people can see them. 
EZK.37.21	And give them this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.37.22	I will unify them into one nation on the mountains of Israel. One king will rule them all; no longer will they be divided into two nations or into two kingdoms. 
EZK.37.23	They will never again pollute themselves with their idols
EZK.37.24	“My servant David will be their king, and they will have only one shepherd. They will obey my regulations and be careful to keep my decrees. 
EZK.37.25	They will live in the land I gave my servant Jacob, the land where their ancestors lived. They and their children and their grandchildren after them will live there forever, generation after generation. And my servant David will be their prince forever. 
EZK.37.26	And I will make a covenant of peace with them, an everlasting covenant. I will give them their land and increase their numbers,
EZK.37.27	I will make my home among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
EZK.37.28	And when my Temple is among them forever, the nations will know that I am the 
EZK.38.1	This is another message that came to me from the 
EZK.38.2	“Son of man, turn and face Gog of the land of Magog, the prince who rules over the nations of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him. 
EZK.38.3	Give him this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.38.4	I will turn you around and put hooks in your jaws to lead you out with your whole army—your horses and charioteers in full armor and a great horde armed with shields and swords. 
EZK.38.5	Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya
EZK.38.6	Gomer and all its armies will also join you, along with the armies of Beth-togarmah from the distant north, and many others.
EZK.38.7	“Get ready; be prepared! Keep all the armies around you mobilized, and take command of them. 
EZK.38.8	A long time from now you will be called into action. In the distant future you will swoop down on the land of Israel, which will be enjoying peace after recovering from war and after its people have returned from many lands to the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.38.9	You and all your allies—a vast and awesome army—will roll down on them like a storm and cover the land like a cloud.
EZK.38.10	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.38.11	You will say, ‘Israel is an unprotected land filled with unwalled villages! I will march against her and destroy these people who live in such confidence! 
EZK.38.12	I will go to those formerly desolate cities that are now filled with people who have returned from exile in many nations. I will capture vast amounts of plunder, for the people are rich with livestock and other possessions now. They think the whole world revolves around them!’ 
EZK.38.13	But Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish will ask, ‘Do you really think the armies you have gathered can rob them of silver and gold? Do you think you can drive away their livestock and seize their goods and carry off plunder?’
EZK.38.14	“Therefore, son of man, prophesy against Gog. Give him this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.38.15	You will come from your homeland in the distant north with your vast cavalry and your mighty army, 
EZK.38.16	and you will attack my people Israel, covering their land like a cloud. At that time in the distant future, I will bring you against my land as everyone watches, and my holiness will be displayed by what happens to you, Gog. Then all the nations will know that I am the 
EZK.38.17	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.38.18	But this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.38.19	In my jealousy and blazing anger, I promise a mighty shaking in the land of Israel on that day. 
EZK.38.20	All living things—the fish in the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, the small animals that scurry along the ground, and all the people on earth—will quake in terror at my presence. Mountains will be thrown down; cliffs will crumble; walls will fall to the earth. 
EZK.38.21	I will summon the sword against you on all the hills of Israel, says the Sovereign 
EZK.38.22	I will punish you and your armies with disease and bloodshed; I will send torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and burning sulfur! 
EZK.38.23	In this way, I will show my greatness and holiness, and I will make myself known to all the nations of the world. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.39.1	“Son of man, prophesy against Gog. Give him this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.39.2	I will turn you around and drive you toward the mountains of Israel, bringing you from the distant north. 
EZK.39.3	I will knock the bow from your left hand and the arrows from your right hand, and I will leave you helpless. 
EZK.39.4	You and your army and your allies will all die on the mountains. I will feed you to the vultures and wild animals. 
EZK.39.5	You will fall in the open fields, for I have spoken, says the Sovereign 
EZK.39.6	And I will rain down fire on Magog and on all your allies who live safely on the coasts. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.39.7	“In this way, I will make known my holy name among my people of Israel. I will not let anyone bring shame on it. And the nations, too, will know that I am the 
EZK.39.8	That day of judgment will come, says the Sovereign 
EZK.39.9	“Then the people in the towns of Israel will go out and pick up your small and large shields, bows and arrows, javelins and spears, and they will use them for fuel. There will be enough to last them seven years! 
EZK.39.10	They won’t need to cut wood from the fields or forests, for these weapons will give them all the fuel they need. They will plunder those who planned to plunder them, and they will rob those who planned to rob them, says the Sovereign 
EZK.39.11	“And I will make a vast graveyard for Gog and his hordes in the Valley of the Travelers, east of the Dead Sea.
EZK.39.12	It will take seven months for the people of Israel to bury the bodies and cleanse the land. 
EZK.39.13	Everyone in Israel will help, for it will be a glorious victory for Israel when I demonstrate my glory on that day, says the Sovereign 
EZK.39.14	“After seven months, teams of men will be appointed to search the land for skeletons to bury, so the land will be made clean again. 
EZK.39.15	Whenever bones are found, a marker will be set up so the burial crews will take them to be buried in the Valley of Gog’s Hordes. 
EZK.39.16	(There will be a town there named Hamonah, which means ‘horde.’) And so the land will finally be cleansed.
EZK.39.17	“And now, son of man, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.39.18	Eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of princes as though they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls—all fattened animals from Bashan! 
EZK.39.19	Gorge yourselves with flesh until you are glutted; drink blood until you are drunk. This is the sacrificial feast I have prepared for you. 
EZK.39.20	Feast at my banquet table—feast on horses and charioteers, on mighty men and all kinds of valiant warriors, says the Sovereign 
EZK.39.21	“In this way, I will demonstrate my glory to the nations. Everyone will see the punishment I have inflicted on them and the power of my fist when I strike. 
EZK.39.22	And from that time on the people of Israel will know that I am the 
EZK.39.23	The nations will then know why Israel was sent away to exile—it was punishment for sin, for they were unfaithful to their God. Therefore, I turned away from them and let their enemies destroy them. 
EZK.39.24	I turned my face away and punished them because of their defilement and their sins.
EZK.39.25	“So now, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.39.26	They will accept responsibility for
EZK.39.27	When I bring them home from the lands of their enemies, I will display my holiness among them for all the nations to see. 
EZK.39.28	Then my people will know that I am the 
EZK.39.29	And I will never again turn my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit upon the people of Israel. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.40.1	On April 28,
EZK.40.2	In a vision from God he took me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain. From there I could see toward the south what appeared to be a city. 
EZK.40.3	As he brought me nearer, I saw a man whose face shone like bronze standing beside a gateway entrance. He was holding in his hand a linen measuring cord and a measuring rod.
EZK.40.4	He said to me, “Son of man, watch and listen. Pay close attention to everything I show you. You have been brought here so I can show you many things. Then you will return to the people of Israel and tell them everything you have seen.”
EZK.40.5	I could see a wall completely surrounding the Temple area. The man took a measuring rod that was 10
EZK.40.6	Then he went over to the eastern gateway. He climbed the steps and measured the threshold of the gateway; it was 10
EZK.40.7	There were guard alcoves on each side built into the gateway passage. Each of these alcoves was 10
EZK.40.8	He also measured the entry room of the gateway.
EZK.40.9	It was 14 feet
EZK.40.10	There were three guard alcoves on each side of the gateway passage. Each had the same measurements, and the dividing walls separating them were also identical. 
EZK.40.11	The man measured the gateway entrance, which was 17
EZK.40.12	In front of each of the guard alcoves was a 21-inch
EZK.40.13	Then he measured the entire width of the gateway, measuring the distance between the back walls of facing guard alcoves; this distance was 43
EZK.40.14	He measured the dividing walls all along the inside of the gateway up to the entry room of the gateway; this distance was 105 feet.
EZK.40.15	The full length of the gateway passage was 87
EZK.40.16	There were recessed windows that narrowed inward through the walls of the guard alcoves and their dividing walls. There were also windows in the entry room. The surfaces of the dividing walls were decorated with carved palm trees.
EZK.40.17	Then the man brought me through the gateway into the outer courtyard of the Temple. A stone pavement ran along the walls of the courtyard, and thirty rooms were built against the walls, opening onto the pavement. 
EZK.40.18	This pavement flanked the gates and extended out from the walls into the courtyard the same distance as the gateway entrance. This was the lower pavement. 
EZK.40.19	Then the man measured across the Temple’s outer courtyard between the outer and inner gateways; the distance was 175 feet.
EZK.40.20	The man measured the gateway on the north just like the one on the east. 
EZK.40.21	Here, too, there were three guard alcoves on each side, with dividing walls and an entry room. All the measurements matched those of the east gateway. The gateway passage was 87
EZK.40.22	The windows, the entry room, and the palm tree decorations were identical to those in the east gateway. There were seven steps leading up to the gateway entrance, and the entry room was at the inner end of the gateway passage. 
EZK.40.23	Here on the north side, just as on the east, there was another gateway leading to the Temple’s inner courtyard directly opposite this outer gateway. The distance between the two gateways was 175 feet.
EZK.40.24	Then the man took me around to the south gateway and measured its various parts, and they were exactly the same as in the others. 
EZK.40.25	It had windows along the walls as the others did, and there was an entry room where the gateway passage opened into the outer courtyard. And like the others, the gateway passage was 87
EZK.40.26	This gateway also had a stairway of seven steps leading up to it, and an entry room at the inner end, and palm tree decorations along the dividing walls. 
EZK.40.27	And here again, directly opposite the outer gateway, was another gateway that led into the inner courtyard. The distance between the two gateways was 175 feet.
EZK.40.28	Then the man took me to the south gateway leading into the inner courtyard. He measured it, and it had the same measurements as the other gateways. 
EZK.40.29	Its guard alcoves, dividing walls, and entry room were the same size as those in the others. It also had windows along its walls and in the entry room. And like the others, the gateway passage was 87
EZK.40.30	(The entry rooms of the gateways leading into the inner courtyard were 14 feet
EZK.40.31	The entry room to the south gateway faced into the outer courtyard. It had palm tree decorations on its columns, and there were eight steps leading to its entrance.
EZK.40.32	Then he took me to the east gateway leading to the inner courtyard. He measured it, and it had the same measurements as the other gateways. 
EZK.40.33	Its guard alcoves, dividing walls, and entry room were the same size as those of the others, and there were windows along the walls and in the entry room. The gateway passage measured 87
EZK.40.34	Its entry room faced into the outer courtyard. It had palm tree decorations on its columns, and there were eight steps leading to its entrance.
EZK.40.35	Then he took me around to the north gateway leading to the inner courtyard. He measured it, and it had the same measurements as the other gateways. 
EZK.40.36	The guard alcoves, dividing walls, and entry room of this gateway had the same measurements as in the others and the same window arrangements. The gateway passage measured 87
EZK.40.37	Its entry room
EZK.40.38	A door led from the entry room of one of the inner gateways into a side room, where the meat for sacrifices was washed. 
EZK.40.39	On each side of this entry room were two tables, where the sacrificial animals were slaughtered for the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings. 
EZK.40.40	Outside the entry room, on each side of the stairs going up to the north entrance, were two more tables. 
EZK.40.41	So there were eight tables in all—four inside and four outside—where the sacrifices were cut up and prepared. 
EZK.40.42	There were also four tables of finished stone for preparation of the burnt offerings, each 31
EZK.40.43	There were hooks, each 3 inches
EZK.40.44	Inside the inner courtyard were two rooms,
EZK.40.45	And the man said to me, “The room beside the north inner gate is for the priests who supervise the Temple maintenance. 
EZK.40.46	The room beside the south inner gate is for the priests in charge of the altar—the descendants of Zadok—for they alone of all the Levites may approach the 
EZK.40.47	Then the man measured the inner courtyard, and it was a square, 175 feet wide and 175 feet across. The altar stood in the courtyard in front of the Temple. 
EZK.40.48	Then he brought me to the entry room of the Temple. He measured the walls on either side of the opening to the entry room, and they were 8
EZK.40.49	The entry room was 35 feet
EZK.41.1	After that, the man brought me into the sanctuary of the Temple. He measured the walls on either side of its doorway,
EZK.41.2	The doorway was 17
EZK.41.3	Then he went beyond the sanctuary into the inner room. He measured the walls on either side of its entrance, and they were 3
EZK.41.4	The inner room of the sanctuary was 35 feet
EZK.41.5	Then he measured the wall of the Temple, and it was 10
EZK.41.6	These side rooms were built in three levels, one above the other, with thirty rooms on each level. The supports for these side rooms rested on exterior ledges on the Temple wall; they did not extend into the wall. 
EZK.41.7	Each level was wider than the one below it, corresponding to the narrowing of the Temple wall as it rose higher. A stairway led up from the bottom level through the middle level to the top level.
EZK.41.8	I saw that the Temple was built on a terrace, which provided a foundation for the side rooms. This terrace was 10
EZK.41.9	The outer wall of the Temple’s side rooms was 8
EZK.41.10	and the row of rooms along the outer wall of the inner courtyard. This open area was 35 feet wide, and it went all the way around the Temple. 
EZK.41.11	Two doors opened from the side rooms into the terrace yard, which was 8
EZK.41.12	A large building stood on the west, facing the Temple courtyard. It was 122
EZK.41.13	Then the man measured the Temple, and it was 175 feet
EZK.41.14	The inner courtyard to the east of the Temple was also 175 feet wide. 
EZK.41.15	The building to the west, including its two walls, was also 175 feet wide.
EZK.41.15	The sanctuary, the inner room, and the entry room of the Temple 
EZK.41.16	were all paneled with wood, as were the frames of the recessed windows. The inner walls of the Temple were paneled with wood above and below the windows. 
EZK.41.17	The space above the door leading into the inner room, and its walls inside and out, were also paneled. 
EZK.41.18	All the walls were decorated with carvings of cherubim, each with two faces, and there was a carving of a palm tree between each of the cherubim. 
EZK.41.19	One face—that of a man—looked toward the palm tree on one side. The other face—that of a young lion—looked toward the palm tree on the other side. The figures were carved all along the inside of the Temple, 
EZK.41.20	from the floor to the top of the walls, including the outer wall of the sanctuary.
EZK.41.21	There were square columns at the entrance to the sanctuary, and the ones at the entrance of the Most Holy Place were similar. 
EZK.41.22	There was an altar made of wood, 5
EZK.41.23	Both the sanctuary and the Most Holy Place had double doorways, 
EZK.41.24	each with two swinging doors. 
EZK.41.25	The doors leading into the sanctuary were decorated with carved cherubim and palm trees, just as on the walls. And there was a wooden roof at the front of the entry room to the Temple. 
EZK.41.26	On both sides of the entry room were recessed windows decorated with carved palm trees. The side rooms along the outside wall also had roofs.
EZK.42.1	Then the man led me out of the Temple courtyard by way of the north gateway. We entered the outer courtyard and came to a group of rooms against the north wall of the inner courtyard. 
EZK.42.2	This structure, whose entrance opened toward the north, was 175 feet
EZK.42.3	One block of rooms overlooked the 35-foot
EZK.42.4	Between the two blocks of rooms ran a walkway 17
EZK.42.5	Each of the two upper levels of rooms was narrower than the one beneath it because the upper levels had to allow space for walkways in front of them. 
EZK.42.6	Since there were three levels and they did not have supporting columns as in the courtyards, each of the upper levels was set back from the level beneath it. 
EZK.42.7	There was an outer wall that separated the rooms from the outer courtyard; it was 87
EZK.42.8	This wall added length to the outer block of rooms, which extended for only 87
EZK.42.9	There was an eastern entrance from the outer courtyard to these rooms.
EZK.42.10	On the south
EZK.42.11	There was a walkway between the two blocks of rooms just like the complex on the north side of the Temple. This complex of rooms was the same length and width as the other one, and it had the same entrances and doors. The dimensions of each were identical. 
EZK.42.12	So there was an entrance in the wall facing the doors of the inner block of rooms, and another on the east at the end of the interior walkway.
EZK.42.13	Then the man told me, “These rooms that overlook the Temple from the north and south are holy. Here the priests who offer sacrifices to the 
EZK.42.14	When the priests leave the sanctuary, they must not go directly to the outer courtyard. They must first take off the clothes they wore while ministering, because these clothes are holy. They must put on other clothes before entering the parts of the building complex open to the public.”
EZK.42.15	When the man had finished measuring the inside of the Temple area, he led me out through the east gateway to measure the entire perimeter. 
EZK.42.16	He measured the east side with his measuring rod, and it was 875 feet long.
EZK.42.17	Then he measured the north side, and it was also 875 feet. 
EZK.42.18	The south side was also 875 feet, 
EZK.42.19	and the west side was also 875 feet. 
EZK.42.20	So the area was 875 feet on each side with a wall all around it to separate what was holy from what was common.
EZK.43.1	After this, the man brought me back around to the east gateway. 
EZK.43.2	Suddenly, the glory of the God of Israel appeared from the east. The sound of his coming was like the roar of rushing waters, and the whole landscape shone with his glory. 
EZK.43.3	This vision was just like the others I had seen, first by the Kebar River and then when he came
EZK.43.4	And the glory of the 
EZK.43.5	Then the Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner courtyard, and the glory of the 
EZK.43.6	And I heard someone speaking to me from within the Temple, while the man who had been measuring stood beside me. 
EZK.43.7	The 
EZK.43.8	They put their idol altars right next to mine with only a wall between them and me. They defiled my holy name by such detestable sin, so I consumed them in my anger. 
EZK.43.9	Now let them stop worshiping other gods and honoring the relics of their kings, and I will live among them forever.
EZK.43.10	“Son of man, describe to the people of Israel the Temple I have shown you, so they will be ashamed of all their sins. Let them study its plan, 
EZK.43.11	and they will be ashamed
EZK.43.12	And this is the basic law of the Temple: absolute holiness! The entire top of the mountain where the Temple is built is holy. Yes, this is the basic law of the Temple.
EZK.43.13	“These are the measurements of the altar
EZK.43.14	From the gutter the altar rises 3
EZK.43.15	The top of the altar, the hearth, rises another 7 feet higher, with a horn rising up from each of the four corners. 
EZK.43.16	The top of the altar is square, measuring 21 feet by 21 feet.
EZK.43.17	The upper ledge also forms a square, measuring 24
EZK.43.18	Then he said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.43.19	At that time, the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who minister before me, are to be given a young bull for a sin offering, says the Sovereign 
EZK.43.20	You will take some of its blood and smear it on the four horns of the altar, the four corners of the upper ledge, and the curb that runs around that ledge. This will cleanse and make atonement for the altar. 
EZK.43.21	Then take the young bull for the sin offering and burn it at the appointed place outside the Temple area.
EZK.43.22	“On the second day, sacrifice as a sin offering a young male goat that has no physical defects. Then cleanse and make atonement for the altar again, just as you did with the young bull. 
EZK.43.23	When you have finished the cleansing ceremony, offer another young bull that has no defects and a perfect ram from the flock. 
EZK.43.24	You are to present them to the 
EZK.43.25	“Every day for seven days a male goat, a young bull, and a ram from the flock will be sacrificed as a sin offering. None of these animals may have physical defects of any kind. 
EZK.43.26	Do this each day for seven days to cleanse and make atonement for the altar, thus setting it apart for holy use. 
EZK.43.27	On the eighth day, and on each day afterward, the priests will sacrifice on the altar the burnt offerings and peace offerings of the people. Then I will accept you. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.44.1	Then the man brought me back to the east gateway in the outer wall of the Temple area, but it was closed. 
EZK.44.2	And the 
EZK.44.3	Only the prince himself may sit inside this gateway to feast in the 
EZK.44.4	Then the man brought me through the north gateway to the front of the Temple. I looked and saw that the glory of the 
EZK.44.5	And the 
EZK.44.6	And give these rebels, the people of Israel, this message from the Sovereign 
EZK.44.7	You have brought uncircumcised foreigners into my sanctuary—people who have no heart for God. In this way, you defiled my Temple even as you offered me my food, the fat and blood of sacrifices. In addition to all your other detestable sins, you have broken my covenant. 
EZK.44.8	Instead of safeguarding my sacred rituals, you have hired foreigners to take charge of my sanctuary.
EZK.44.9	“So this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.44.10	And the men of the tribe of Levi who abandoned me when Israel strayed away from me to worship idols
EZK.44.11	They may still be Temple guards and gatekeepers, and they may slaughter the animals brought for burnt offerings and be present to help the people. 
EZK.44.12	But they encouraged my people to worship idols, causing Israel to fall into deep sin. So I have taken a solemn oath that they must bear the consequences for their sins, says the Sovereign 
EZK.44.13	They may not approach me to minister as priests. They may not touch any of my holy things or the holy offerings, for they must bear the shame of all the detestable sins they have committed. 
EZK.44.14	They are to serve as the Temple caretakers, taking charge of the maintenance work and performing general duties.
EZK.44.15	“However, the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok continued to minister faithfully in the Temple when Israel abandoned me for idols. These men will serve as my ministers. They will stand in my presence and offer the fat and blood of the sacrifices, says the Sovereign 
EZK.44.16	They alone will enter my sanctuary and approach my table to serve me. They will fulfill all my requirements.
EZK.44.17	“When they enter the gateway to the inner courtyard, they must wear only linen clothing. They must wear no wool while on duty in the inner courtyard or in the Temple itself. 
EZK.44.18	They must wear linen turbans and linen undergarments. They must not wear anything that would cause them to perspire. 
EZK.44.19	When they return to the outer courtyard where the people are, they must take off the clothes they wear while ministering to me. They must leave them in the sacred rooms and put on other clothes so they do not endanger anyone by transmitting holiness to them through this clothing.
EZK.44.20	“They must neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow too long. Instead, they must trim it regularly. 
EZK.44.21	The priests must not drink wine before entering the inner courtyard. 
EZK.44.22	They may choose their wives only from among the virgins of Israel or the widows of the priests. They may not marry other widows or divorced women. 
EZK.44.23	They will teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is common, what is ceremonially clean and unclean.
EZK.44.24	“They will serve as judges to resolve any disagreements among my people. Their decisions must be based on my regulations. And the priests themselves must obey my instructions and decrees at all the sacred festivals, and see to it that the Sabbaths are set apart as holy days.
EZK.44.25	“A priest must not defile himself by being in the presence of a dead person unless it is his father, mother, child, brother, or unmarried sister. In such cases it is permitted. 
EZK.44.26	Even then, he can return to his Temple duties only after being ceremonially cleansed and then waiting for seven days. 
EZK.44.27	The first day he returns to work and enters the inner courtyard and the sanctuary, he must offer a sin offering for himself, says the Sovereign 
EZK.44.28	“The priests will not have any property or possession of land, for I alone am their special possession. 
EZK.44.29	Their food will come from the gifts and sacrifices brought to the Temple by the people—the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings. Whatever anyone sets apart
EZK.44.30	The first of the ripe fruits and all the gifts brought to the 
EZK.44.31	The priests may not eat meat from any bird or animal that dies a natural death or that dies after being attacked by another animal.
EZK.45.1	“When you divide the land among the tribes of Israel, you must set aside a section for the 
EZK.45.2	A section of this land, measuring 875 feet by 875 feet,
EZK.45.3	Within the larger sacred area, measure out a portion of land 8
EZK.45.4	This area will be holy, set aside for the priests who minister to the 
EZK.45.5	The strip of sacred land next to it, also 8
EZK.45.6	“Adjacent to the larger sacred area will be a section of land 8
EZK.45.7	“Two special sections of land will be set apart for the prince. One section will share a border with the east side of the sacred lands and city, and the second section will share a border on the west side. Then the far eastern and western borders of the prince’s lands will line up with the eastern and western boundaries of the tribal areas. 
EZK.45.8	These sections of land will be the prince’s allotment. Then my princes will no longer oppress and rob my people; they will assign the rest of the land to the people, giving an allotment to each tribe.
EZK.45.9	“For this is what the Sovereign 
EZK.45.10	Use only honest weights and scales and honest measures, both dry and liquid.
EZK.45.11	The homer
EZK.45.12	The standard unit for weight will be the silver shekel.
EZK.45.13	“You must give this tax to the prince: one bushel of wheat or barley for every 60
EZK.45.14	one percent of your olive oil,
EZK.45.15	and one sheep or goat for every 200 in your flocks in Israel. These will be the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings that will make atonement for the people who bring them, says the Sovereign 
EZK.45.16	All the people of Israel must join in bringing these offerings to the prince. 
EZK.45.17	The prince will be required to provide offerings that are given at the religious festivals, the new moon celebrations, the Sabbath days, and all other similar occasions. He will provide the sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, liquid offerings, and peace offerings to purify the people of Israel, making them right with the 
EZK.45.18	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.45.19	The priest will take blood from this sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the Temple, the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar, and the gateposts at the entrance to the inner courtyard. 
EZK.45.20	Do this also on the seventh day of the new year for anyone who has sinned through error or ignorance. In this way, you will purify
EZK.45.21	“On the fourteenth day of the first month,
EZK.45.22	On the day of Passover the prince will provide a young bull as a sin offering for himself and the people of Israel. 
EZK.45.23	On each of the seven days of the feast he will prepare a burnt offering to the 
EZK.45.24	The prince will provide a basket of flour as a grain offering and a gallon of olive oil
EZK.45.25	“During the seven days of the Festival of Shelters, which occurs every year in early autumn,
EZK.46.1	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.46.2	The prince will enter the entry room of the gateway from the outside. Then he will stand by the gatepost while the priest offers his burnt offering and peace offering. He will bow down in worship inside the gateway passage and then go back out the way he came. The gateway will not be closed until evening. 
EZK.46.3	The common people will bow down and worship the 
EZK.46.4	“Each Sabbath day the prince will present to the 
EZK.46.5	He will present a grain offering of a basket of choice flour to go with the ram and whatever amount of flour he chooses to go with each lamb, and he is to offer one gallon of olive oil
EZK.46.6	At the new moon celebrations, he will bring one young bull, six lambs, and one ram, all with no defects. 
EZK.46.7	With the young bull he must bring a basket of choice flour for a grain offering. With the ram he must bring another basket of flour. And with each lamb he is to bring whatever amount of flour he chooses to give. With each basket of flour he must offer one gallon of olive oil.
EZK.46.8	“The prince must enter the gateway through the entry room, and he must leave the same way. 
EZK.46.9	But when the people come in through the north gateway to worship the 
EZK.46.10	The prince will enter and leave with the people on these occasions.
EZK.46.11	“So at the special feasts and sacred festivals, the grain offering will be a basket of choice flour with each young bull, another basket of flour with each ram, and as much flour as the worshiper chooses to give with each lamb. Give one gallon of olive oil with each basket of flour. 
EZK.46.12	When the prince offers a voluntary burnt offering or peace offering to the

EZK.46.14	With the lamb, a grain offering must also be given to the 
EZK.46.15	The lamb, the grain offering, and the olive oil must be given as a daily sacrifice every morning without fail.
EZK.46.16	“This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.46.17	But if the prince gives a gift of land from his inheritance to one of his servants, the servant may keep it only until the Year of Jubilee, which comes every fiftieth year.
EZK.46.18	And the prince may never take anyone’s property by force. If he gives property to his sons, it must be from his own land, for I do not want any of my people unjustly evicted from their property.”
EZK.46.19	In my vision, the man brought me through the entrance beside the gateway and led me to the sacred rooms assigned to the priests, which faced toward the north. He showed me a place at the extreme west end of these rooms. 
EZK.46.20	He explained, “This is where the priests will cook the meat from the guilt offerings and sin offerings and bake the flour from the grain offerings into bread. They will do it here to avoid carrying the sacrifices through the outer courtyard and endangering the people by transmitting holiness to them.”
EZK.46.21	Then he brought me back to the outer courtyard and led me to each of its four corners. In each corner I saw an enclosure. 
EZK.46.22	Each of these enclosures was 70 feet long and 52
EZK.46.23	Along the inside of these walls was a ledge of stone with fireplaces under the ledge all the way around. 
EZK.46.24	The man said to me, “These are the kitchens to be used by the Temple assistants to boil the sacrifices offered by the people.”
EZK.47.1	In my vision, the man brought me back to the entrance of the Temple. There I saw a stream flowing east from beneath the door of the Temple and passing to the right of the altar on its south side. 
EZK.47.2	The man brought me outside the wall through the north gateway and led me around to the eastern entrance. There I could see the water flowing out through the south side of the east gateway.
EZK.47.3	Measuring as he went, he took me along the stream for 1,750 feet
EZK.47.4	He measured off another 1,750 feet and led me across again. This time the water was up to my knees. After another 1,750 feet, it was up to my waist. 
EZK.47.5	Then he measured another 1,750 feet, and the river was too deep to walk across. It was deep enough to swim in, but too deep to walk through.
EZK.47.6	He asked me, “Have you been watching, son of man?” Then he led me back along the riverbank. 
EZK.47.7	When I returned, I was surprised by the sight of many trees growing on both sides of the river. 
EZK.47.8	Then he said to me, “This river flows east through the desert into the valley of the Dead Sea.
EZK.47.9	There will be swarms of living things wherever the water of this river flows.
EZK.47.10	Fishermen will stand along the shores of the Dead Sea. All the way from En-gedi to En-eglaim, the shores will be covered with nets drying in the sun. Fish of every kind will fill the Dead Sea, just as they fill the Mediterranean.
EZK.47.11	But the marshes and swamps will not be purified; they will still be salty. 
EZK.47.12	Fruit trees of all kinds will grow along both sides of the river. The leaves of these trees will never turn brown and fall, and there will always be fruit on their branches. There will be a new crop every month, for they are watered by the river flowing from the Temple. The fruit will be for food and the leaves for healing.”
EZK.47.13	This is what the Sovereign 
EZK.47.14	Otherwise each tribe will receive an equal share. I took a solemn oath and swore that I would give this land to your ancestors, and it will now come to you as your possession.
EZK.47.15	“These are the boundaries of the land: The northern border will run from the Mediterranean toward Hethlon, then on through Lebo-hamath to Zedad; 
EZK.47.16	then it will run to Berothah and Sibraim,
EZK.47.17	So the northern border will run from the Mediterranean to Hazar-enan, on the border between Hamath to the north and Damascus to the south.
EZK.47.18	“The eastern border starts at a point between Hauran and Damascus and runs south along the Jordan River between Israel and Gilead, past the Dead Sea
EZK.47.19	“The southern border will go west from Tamar to the waters of Meribah at Kadesh
EZK.47.20	“On the west side, the Mediterranean itself will be your border from the southern border to the point where the northern border begins, opposite Lebo-hamath.
EZK.47.21	“Divide the land within these boundaries among the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	Distribute the land as an allotment for yourselves and for the foreigners who have joined you and are raising their families among you. They will be like native-born Israelites to you and will receive an allotment among the tribes. 
EZK.47.23	These foreigners are to be given land within the territory of the tribe with whom they now live. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.48.1	“Here is the list of the tribes of Israel and the territory each is to receive. The territory of Dan is in the extreme north. Its boundary line follows the Hethlon road to Lebo-hamath and then runs on to Hazar-enan on the border of Damascus, with Hamath to the north. Dan’s territory extends all the way across the land of Israel from east to west.
EZK.48.2	“Asher’s territory lies south of Dan’s and also extends from east to west. 
EZK.48.3	Naphtali’s land lies south of Asher’s, also extending from east to west. 
EZK.48.4	Then comes Manasseh south of Naphtali, and its territory also extends from east to west. 
EZK.48.5	South of Manasseh is Ephraim, 
EZK.48.6	and then Reuben, 
EZK.48.7	and then Judah, all of whose boundaries extend from east to west.
EZK.48.8	“South of Judah is the land set aside for a special purpose. It will be 8
EZK.48.9	“The area set aside for the 
EZK.48.10	For the priests there will be a strip of land measuring 8
EZK.48.11	This area is set aside for the ordained priests, the descendants of Zadok who served me faithfully and did not go astray with the people of Israel and the rest of the Levites. 
EZK.48.12	It will be their special portion when the land is distributed, the most sacred land of all. Next to the priests’ territory will lie the land where the other Levites will live.
EZK.48.13	“The land allotted to the Levites will be the same size and shape as that belonging to the priests—8
EZK.48.14	None of this special land may ever be sold or traded or used by others, for it belongs to the 
EZK.48.15	“An additional strip of land 8
EZK.48.16	The city will measure 1
EZK.48.17	Open lands will surround the city for 150 yards
EZK.48.18	Outside the city there will be a farming area that stretches 3
EZK.48.19	Those who come from the various tribes to work in the city may farm it. 
EZK.48.20	This entire area—including the sacred lands and the city—is a square that measures 8
EZK.48.21	“The areas that remain, to the east and to the west of the sacred lands and the city, will belong to the prince. Each of these areas will be 8
EZK.48.22	So the prince’s land will include everything between the territories allotted to Judah and Benjamin, except for the areas set aside for the sacred lands and the city.
EZK.48.23	“These are the territories allotted to the rest of the tribes. Benjamin’s territory lies just south of the prince’s lands, and it extends across the entire land of Israel from east to west. 
EZK.48.24	South of Benjamin’s territory lies that of Simeon, also extending across the land from east to west. 
EZK.48.25	Next is the territory of Issachar with the same eastern and western boundaries.
EZK.48.26	“Then comes the territory of Zebulun, which also extends across the land from east to west. 
EZK.48.27	The territory of Gad is just south of Zebulun with the same borders to the east and west. 
EZK.48.28	The southern border of Gad runs from Tamar to the waters of Meribah at Kadesh
EZK.48.29	“These are the allotments that will be set aside for each tribe’s exclusive possession. I, the Sovereign 
EZK.48.30	“These will be the exits to the city: On the north wall, which is 1
EZK.48.31	there will be three gates, each one named after a tribe of Israel. The first will be named for Reuben, the second for Judah, and the third for Levi. 
EZK.48.32	On the east wall, also 1
EZK.48.33	The south wall, also 1
EZK.48.34	And on the west wall, also 1
EZK.48.35	“The distance around the entire city will be 6 miles.
DAN.1.1	During the third year of King Jehoiakim’s reign in Judah,
DAN.1.2	The Lord gave him victory over King Jehoiakim of Judah and permitted him to take some of the sacred objects from the Temple of God. So Nebuchadnezzar took them back to the land of Babylonia
DAN.1.3	Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief of staff, to bring to the palace some of the young men of Judah’s royal family and other noble families, who had been brought to Babylon as captives. 
DAN.1.4	“Select only strong, healthy, and good-looking young men,” he said. “Make sure they are well versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge and good judgment, and are suited to serve in the royal palace. Train these young men in the language and literature of Babylon.
DAN.1.5	The king assigned them a daily ration of food and wine from his own kitchens. They were to be trained for three years, and then they would enter the royal service.
DAN.1.6	Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were four of the young men chosen, all from the tribe of Judah. 
DAN.1.7	The chief of staff renamed them with these Babylonian names:
DAN.1.7	Daniel was called Belteshazzar.
DAN.1.7	Hananiah was called Shadrach.
DAN.1.7	Mishael was called Meshach.
DAN.1.7	Azariah was called Abednego.
DAN.1.8	But Daniel was determined not to defile himself by eating the food and wine given to them by the king. He asked the chief of staff for permission not to eat these unacceptable foods. 
DAN.1.9	Now God had given the chief of staff both respect and affection for Daniel. 
DAN.1.10	But he responded, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has ordered that you eat this food and wine. If you become pale and thin compared to the other youths your age, I am afraid the king will have me beheaded.”
DAN.1.11	Daniel spoke with the attendant who had been appointed by the chief of staff to look after Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
DAN.1.12	“Please test us for ten days on a diet of vegetables and water,” Daniel said. 
DAN.1.13	“At the end of the ten days, see how we look compared to the other young men who are eating the king’s food. Then make your decision in light of what you see.” 
DAN.1.14	The attendant agreed to Daniel’s suggestion and tested them for ten days.
DAN.1.15	At the end of the ten days, Daniel and his three friends looked healthier and better nourished than the young men who had been eating the food assigned by the king. 
DAN.1.16	So after that, the attendant fed them only vegetables instead of the food and wine provided for the others.
DAN.1.17	God gave these four young men an unusual aptitude for understanding every aspect of literature and wisdom. And God gave Daniel the special ability to interpret the meanings of visions and dreams.
DAN.1.18	When the training period ordered by the king was completed, the chief of staff brought all the young men to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	The king talked with them, and no one impressed him as much as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they entered the royal service. 
DAN.1.20	Whenever the king consulted them in any matter requiring wisdom and balanced judgment, he found them ten times more capable than any of the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom.
DAN.1.21	Daniel remained in the royal service until the first year of the reign of King Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	One night during the second year of his reign,
DAN.2.2	He called in his magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers,
DAN.2.3	he said, “I have had a dream that deeply troubles me, and I must know what it means.”
DAN.2.4	Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic,
DAN.2.5	But the king said to the astrologers, “I am serious about this. If you don’t tell me what my dream was and what it means, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be turned into heaps of rubble! 
DAN.2.6	But if you tell me what I dreamed and what the dream means, I will give you many wonderful gifts and honors. Just tell me the dream and what it means!”
DAN.2.7	They said again, “Please, Your Majesty. Tell us the dream, and we will tell you what it means.”
DAN.2.8	The king replied, “I know what you are doing! You’re stalling for time because you know I am serious when I say, 
DAN.2.9	‘If you don’t tell me the dream, you are doomed.’ So you have conspired to tell me lies, hoping I will change my mind. But tell me the dream, and then I’ll know that you can tell me what it means.”
DAN.2.10	The astrologers replied to the king, “No one on earth can tell the king his dream! And no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer! 
DAN.2.11	The king’s demand is impossible. No one except the gods can tell you your dream, and they do not live here among people.”
DAN.2.12	The king was furious when he heard this, and he ordered that all the wise men of Babylon be executed. 
DAN.2.13	And because of the king’s decree, men were sent to find and kill Daniel and his friends.
DAN.2.14	When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, came to kill them, Daniel handled the situation with wisdom and discretion. 
DAN.2.15	He asked Arioch, “Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?” So Arioch told him all that had happened. 
DAN.2.16	Daniel went at once to see the king and requested more time to tell the king what the dream meant.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah what had happened. 
DAN.2.18	He urged them to ask the God of heaven to show them his mercy by telling them the secret, so they would not be executed along with the other wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.19	That night the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven. 
DAN.2.20	He said, 
DAN.2.20	“Praise the name of God forever and ever,
DAN.2.20	for he has all wisdom and power.
DAN.2.21	He controls the course of world events;
DAN.2.21	he removes kings and sets up other kings.
DAN.2.21	He gives wisdom to the wise
DAN.2.21	and knowledge to the scholars.
DAN.2.22	He reveals deep and mysterious things
DAN.2.22	and knows what lies hidden in darkness,
DAN.2.22	though he is surrounded by light.
DAN.2.23	I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors,
DAN.2.23	for you have given me wisdom and strength.
DAN.2.23	You have told me what we asked of you
DAN.2.23	and revealed to us what the king demanded.”
DAN.2.24	Then Daniel went in to see Arioch, whom the king had ordered to execute the wise men of Babylon. Daniel said to him, “Don’t kill the wise men. Take me to the king, and I will tell him the meaning of his dream.”
DAN.2.25	Arioch quickly took Daniel to the king and said, “I have found one of the captives from Judah who will tell the king the meaning of his dream!”
DAN.2.26	The king said to Daniel (also known as Belteshazzar), “Is this true? Can you tell me what my dream was and what it means?”
DAN.2.27	Daniel replied, “There are no wise men, enchanters, magicians, or fortune-tellers who can reveal the king’s secret. 
DAN.2.28	But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you your dream and the visions you saw as you lay on your bed.
DAN.2.29	“While Your Majesty was sleeping, you dreamed about coming events. He who reveals secrets has shown you what is going to happen. 
DAN.2.30	And it is not because I am wiser than anyone else that I know the secret of your dream, but because God wants you to understand what was in your heart.
DAN.2.31	“In your vision, Your Majesty, you saw standing before you a huge, shining statue of a man. It was a frightening sight. 
DAN.2.32	The head of the statue was made of fine gold. Its chest and arms were silver, its belly and thighs were bronze, 
DAN.2.33	its legs were iron, and its feet were a combination of iron and baked clay. 
DAN.2.34	As you watched, a rock was cut from a mountain,
DAN.2.35	The whole statue was crushed into small pieces of iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold. Then the wind blew them away without a trace, like chaff on a threshing floor. But the rock that knocked the statue down became a great mountain that covered the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	“That was the dream. Now we will tell the king what it means. 
DAN.2.37	Your Majesty, you are the greatest of kings. The God of heaven has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor. 
DAN.2.38	He has made you the ruler over all the inhabited world and has put even the wild animals and birds under your control. You are the head of gold.
DAN.2.39	“But after your kingdom comes to an end, another kingdom, inferior to yours, will rise to take your place. After that kingdom has fallen, yet a third kingdom, represented by bronze, will rise to rule the world. 
DAN.2.40	Following that kingdom, there will be a fourth one, as strong as iron. That kingdom will smash and crush all previous empires, just as iron smashes and crushes everything it strikes. 
DAN.2.41	The feet and toes you saw were a combination of iron and baked clay, showing that this kingdom will be divided. Like iron mixed with clay, it will have some of the strength of iron. 
DAN.2.42	But while some parts of it will be as strong as iron, other parts will be as weak as clay. 
DAN.2.43	This mixture of iron and clay also shows that these kingdoms will try to strengthen themselves by forming alliances with each other through intermarriage. But they will not hold together, just as iron and clay do not mix.
DAN.2.44	“During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed or conquered. It will crush all these kingdoms into nothingness, and it will stand forever. 
DAN.2.45	That is the meaning of the rock cut from the mountain, though not by human hands, that crushed to pieces the statue of iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. The great God was showing the king what will happen in the future. The dream is true, and its meaning is certain.”
DAN.2.46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar threw himself down before Daniel and worshiped him, and he commanded his people to offer sacrifices and burn sweet incense before him. 
DAN.2.47	The king said to Daniel, “Truly, your God is the greatest of gods, the Lord over kings, a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this secret.”
DAN.2.48	Then the king appointed Daniel to a high position and gave him many valuable gifts. He made Daniel ruler over the whole province of Babylon, as well as chief over all his wise men. 
DAN.2.49	At Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be in charge of all the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained in the king’s court.
DAN.3.1	King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue ninety feet tall and nine feet wide
DAN.3.2	Then he sent messages to the high officers, officials, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the provincial officials to come to the dedication of the statue he had set up. 
DAN.3.3	So all these officials
DAN.3.4	Then a herald shouted out, “People of all races and nations and languages, listen to the king’s command! 
DAN.3.5	When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and other musical instruments,
DAN.3.6	Anyone who refuses to obey will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”
DAN.3.7	So at the sound of the musical instruments,
DAN.3.8	But some of the astrologers
DAN.3.9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “Long live the king! 
DAN.3.10	You issued a decree requiring all the people to bow down and worship the gold statue when they hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and other musical instruments. 
DAN.3.11	That decree also states that those who refuse to obey must be thrown into a blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.12	But there are some Jews—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—whom you have put in charge of the province of Babylon. They pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They refuse to serve your gods and do not worship the gold statue you have set up.”
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar flew into a rage and ordered that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought before him. When they were brought in, 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you refuse to serve my gods or to worship the gold statue I have set up? 
DAN.3.15	I will give you one more chance to bow down and worship the statue I have made when you hear the sound of the musical instruments.
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you. 
DAN.3.17	If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty. 
DAN.3.18	But even if he doesn’t, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.”
DAN.3.19	Nebuchadnezzar was so furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face became distorted with rage. He commanded that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual. 
DAN.3.20	Then he ordered some of the strongest men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.21	So they tied them up and threw them into the furnace, fully dressed in their pants, turbans, robes, and other garments. 
DAN.3.22	And because the king, in his anger, had demanded such a hot fire in the furnace, the flames killed the soldiers as they threw the three men in. 
DAN.3.23	So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, securely tied, fell into the roaring flames.
DAN.3.24	But suddenly, Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and exclaimed to his advisers, “Didn’t we tie up three men and throw them into the furnace?”
DAN.3.24	“Yes, Your Majesty, we certainly did,” they replied.
DAN.3.25	“Look!” Nebuchadnezzar shouted. “I see four men, unbound, walking around in the fire unharmed! And the fourth looks like a god
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could to the door of the flaming furnace and shouted: “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!”
DAN.3.26	So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stepped out of the fire. 
DAN.3.27	Then the high officers, officials, governors, and advisers crowded around them and saw that the fire had not touched them. Not a hair on their heads was singed, and their clothing was not scorched. They didn’t even smell of smoke!
DAN.3.28	Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel to rescue his servants who trusted in him. They defied the king’s command and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. 
DAN.3.29	Therefore, I make this decree: If any people, whatever their race or nation or language, speak a word against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they will be torn limb from limb, and their houses will be turned into heaps of rubble. There is no other god who can rescue like this!”
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to even higher positions in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	King Nebuchadnezzar sent this message to the people of every race and nation and language throughout the world:
DAN.4.1	“Peace and prosperity to you!
DAN.4.2	“I want you all to know about the miraculous signs and wonders the Most High God has performed for me.
DAN.4.3	How great are his signs,
DAN.4.3	how powerful his wonders!
DAN.4.3	His kingdom will last forever,
DAN.4.3	his rule through all generations.
DAN.4.4	“I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living in my palace in comfort and prosperity. 
DAN.4.5	But one night I had a dream that frightened me; I saw visions that terrified me as I lay in my bed. 
DAN.4.6	So I issued an order calling in all the wise men of Babylon, so they could tell me what my dream meant. 
DAN.4.7	When all the magicians, enchanters, astrologers,
DAN.4.8	At last Daniel came in before me, and I told him the dream. (He was named Belteshazzar after my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)
DAN.4.9	“I said to him, ‘Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is too great for you to solve. Now tell me what my dream means.
DAN.4.10	“‘While I was lying in my bed, this is what I dreamed. I saw a large tree in the middle of the earth. 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew very tall and strong, reaching high into the heavens for all the world to see. 
DAN.4.12	It had fresh green leaves, and it was loaded with fruit for all to eat. Wild animals lived in its shade, and birds nested in its branches. All the world was fed from this tree.
DAN.4.13	“‘Then as I lay there dreaming, I saw a messenger,
DAN.4.14	The messenger shouted,
DAN.4.14	“Cut down the tree and lop off its branches!
DAN.4.14	Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit!
DAN.4.14	Chase the wild animals from its shade
DAN.4.14	and the birds from its branches.
DAN.4.15	But leave the stump and the roots in the ground,
DAN.4.15	bound with a band of iron and bronze
DAN.4.15	and surrounded by tender grass.
DAN.4.15	Now let him be drenched with the dew of heaven,
DAN.4.15	and let him live with the wild animals among the plants of the field.
DAN.4.16	For seven periods of time,
DAN.4.16	let him have the mind of a wild animal
DAN.4.16	instead of the mind of a human.
DAN.4.17	For this has been decreed by the messengers
DAN.4.17	it is commanded by the holy ones,
DAN.4.17	so that everyone may know
DAN.4.17	that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of the world.
DAN.4.17	He gives them to anyone he chooses—
DAN.4.17	even to the lowliest of people.”
DAN.4.18	“‘Belteshazzar, that was the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now tell me what it means, for none of the wise men of my kingdom can do so. But you can tell me because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.’
DAN.4.19	“Upon hearing this, Daniel (also known as Belteshazzar) was overcome for a time, frightened by the meaning of the dream. Then the king said to him, ‘Belteshazzar, don’t be alarmed by the dream and what it means.’
DAN.4.19	“Belteshazzar replied, ‘I wish the events foreshadowed in this dream would happen to your enemies, my lord, and not to you! 
DAN.4.20	The tree you saw was growing very tall and strong, reaching high into the heavens for all the world to see. 
DAN.4.21	It had fresh green leaves and was loaded with fruit for all to eat. Wild animals lived in its shade, and birds nested in its branches. 
DAN.4.22	That tree, Your Majesty, is you. For you have grown strong and great; your greatness reaches up to heaven, and your rule to the ends of the earth.
DAN.4.23	“‘Then you saw a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, “Cut down the tree and destroy it. But leave the stump and the roots in the ground, bound with a band of iron and bronze and surrounded by tender grass. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven. Let him live with the animals of the field for seven periods of time.”
DAN.4.24	“‘This is what the dream means, Your Majesty, and what the Most High has declared will happen to my lord the king. 
DAN.4.25	You will be driven from human society, and you will live in the fields with the wild animals. You will eat grass like a cow, and you will be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven periods of time will pass while you live this way, until you learn that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of the world and gives them to anyone he chooses. 
DAN.4.26	But the stump and roots of the tree were left in the ground. This means that you will receive your kingdom back again when you have learned that heaven rules.
DAN.4.27	“‘King Nebuchadnezzar, please accept my advice. Stop sinning and do what is right. Break from your wicked past and be merciful to the poor. Perhaps then you will continue to prosper.’
DAN.4.28	“But all these things did happen to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.4.29	Twelve months later he was taking a walk on the flat roof of the royal palace in Babylon. 
DAN.4.30	As he looked out across the city, he said, ‘Look at this great city of Babylon! By my own mighty power, I have built this beautiful city as my royal residence to display my majestic splendor.’
DAN.4.31	“While these words were still in his mouth, a voice called down from heaven, ‘O King Nebuchadnezzar, this message is for you! You are no longer ruler of this kingdom. 
DAN.4.32	You will be driven from human society. You will live in the fields with the wild animals, and you will eat grass like a cow. Seven periods of time will pass while you live this way, until you learn that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of the world and gives them to anyone he chooses.’
DAN.4.33	“That same hour the judgment was fulfilled, and Nebuchadnezzar was driven from human society. He ate grass like a cow, and he was drenched with the dew of heaven. He lived this way until his hair was as long as eagles’ feathers and his nails were like birds’ claws.
DAN.4.34	“After this time had passed, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven. My sanity returned, and I praised and worshiped the Most High and honored the one who lives forever.
DAN.4.34	His rule is everlasting,
DAN.4.34	and his kingdom is eternal.
DAN.4.35	All the people of the earth
DAN.4.35	are nothing compared to him.
DAN.4.35	He does as he pleases
DAN.4.35	among the angels of heaven
DAN.4.35	and among the people of the earth.
DAN.4.35	No one can stop him or say to him,
DAN.4.35	‘What do you mean by doing these things?’
DAN.4.36	“When my sanity returned to me, so did my honor and glory and kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored as head of my kingdom, with even greater honor than before.
DAN.4.37	“Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and glorify and honor the King of heaven. All his acts are just and true, and he is able to humble the proud.”
DAN.5.1	Many years later King Belshazzar gave a great feast for 1,000 of his nobles, and he drank wine with them. 
DAN.5.2	While Belshazzar was drinking the wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver cups that his predecessor,
DAN.5.3	So they brought these gold cups taken from the Temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives, and his concubines drank from them. 
DAN.5.4	While they drank from them they praised their idols made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
DAN.5.5	Suddenly, they saw the fingers of a human hand writing on the plaster wall of the king’s palace, near the lampstand. The king himself saw the hand as it wrote, 
DAN.5.6	and his face turned pale with fright. His knees knocked together in fear and his legs gave way beneath him.
DAN.5.7	The king shouted for the enchanters, astrologers,
DAN.5.8	But when all the king’s wise men had come in, none of them could read the writing or tell him what it meant. 
DAN.5.9	So the king grew even more alarmed, and his face turned pale. His nobles, too, were shaken.
DAN.5.10	But when the queen mother heard what was happening, she hurried to the banquet hall. She said to Belshazzar, “Long live the king! Don’t be so pale and frightened. 
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom who has within him the spirit of the holy gods. During Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, this man was found to have insight, understanding, and wisdom like that of the gods. Your predecessor, the king—your predecessor King Nebuchadnezzar—made him chief over all the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and fortune-tellers of Babylon. 
DAN.5.12	This man Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, has exceptional ability and is filled with divine knowledge and understanding. He can interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.”
DAN.5.13	So Daniel was brought in before the king. The king asked him, “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles brought from Judah by my predecessor, King Nebuchadnezzar? 
DAN.5.14	I have heard that you have the spirit of the gods within you and that you are filled with insight, understanding, and wisdom. 
DAN.5.15	My wise men and enchanters have tried to read the words on the wall and tell me their meaning, but they cannot do it. 
DAN.5.16	I am told that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems. If you can read these words and tell me their meaning, you will be clothed in purple robes of royal honor, and you will have a gold chain placed around your neck. You will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”
DAN.5.17	Daniel answered the king, “Keep your gifts or give them to someone else, but I will tell you what the writing means. 
DAN.5.18	Your Majesty, the Most High God gave sovereignty, majesty, glory, and honor to your predecessor, Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.5.19	He made him so great that people of all races and nations and languages trembled before him in fear. He killed those he wanted to kill and spared those he wanted to spare. He honored those he wanted to honor and disgraced those he wanted to disgrace. 
DAN.5.20	But when his heart and mind were puffed up with arrogance, he was brought down from his royal throne and stripped of his glory. 
DAN.5.21	He was driven from human society. He was given the mind of a wild animal, and he lived among the wild donkeys. He ate grass like a cow, and he was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he learned that the Most High God rules over the kingdoms of the world and appoints anyone he desires to rule over them.
DAN.5.22	“You are his successor,
DAN.5.23	For you have proudly defied the Lord of heaven and have had these cups from his Temple brought before you. You and your nobles and your wives and concubines have been drinking wine from them while praising gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone—gods that neither see nor hear nor know anything at all. But you have not honored the God who gives you the breath of life and controls your destiny! 
DAN.5.24	So God has sent this hand to write this message.
DAN.5.25	“This is the message that was written: 
DAN.5.26	This is what these words mean:
DAN.5.26	 means ‘numbered’—God has numbered the days of your reign and has brought it to an end.
DAN.5.27	 means ‘weighed’—you have been weighed on the balances and have not measured up.
DAN.5.28	 means ‘divided’—your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”
DAN.5.29	Then at Belshazzar’s command, Daniel was dressed in purple robes, a gold chain was hung around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.30	That very night Belshazzar, the Babylonian
DAN.5.31	And Darius the Mede took over the kingdom at the age of sixty-two.
DAN.6.1	Darius the Mede decided to divide the kingdom into 120 provinces, and he appointed a high officer to rule over each province. 
DAN.6.2	The king also chose Daniel and two others as administrators to supervise the high officers and protect the king’s interests. 
DAN.6.3	Daniel soon proved himself more capable than all the other administrators and high officers. Because of Daniel’s great ability, the king made plans to place him over the entire empire.
DAN.6.4	Then the other administrators and high officers began searching for some fault in the way Daniel was handling government affairs, but they couldn’t find anything to criticize or condemn. He was faithful, always responsible, and completely trustworthy. 
DAN.6.5	So they concluded, “Our only chance of finding grounds for accusing Daniel will be in connection with the rules of his religion.”
DAN.6.6	So the administrators and high officers went to the king and said, “Long live King Darius! 
DAN.6.7	We are all in agreement—we administrators, officials, high officers, advisers, and governors—that the king should make a law that will be strictly enforced. Give orders that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human—except to you, Your Majesty—will be thrown into the den of lions. 
DAN.6.8	And now, Your Majesty, issue and sign this law so it cannot be changed, an official law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked.” 
DAN.6.9	So King Darius signed the law.
DAN.6.10	But when Daniel learned that the law had been signed, he went home and knelt down as usual in his upstairs room, with its windows open toward Jerusalem. He prayed three times a day, just as he had always done, giving thanks to his God. 
DAN.6.11	Then the officials went together to Daniel’s house and found him praying and asking for God’s help. 
DAN.6.12	So they went straight to the king and reminded him about his law. “Did you not sign a law that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human—except to you, Your Majesty—will be thrown into the den of lions?”
DAN.6.12	“Yes,” the king replied, “that decision stands; it is an official law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked.”
DAN.6.13	Then they told the king, “That man Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, is ignoring you and your law. He still prays to his God three times a day.”
DAN.6.14	Hearing this, the king was deeply troubled, and he tried to think of a way to save Daniel. He spent the rest of the day looking for a way to get Daniel out of this predicament.
DAN.6.15	In the evening the men went together to the king and said, “Your Majesty, you know that according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, no law that the king signs can be changed.”
DAN.6.16	So at last the king gave orders for Daniel to be arrested and thrown into the den of lions. The king said to him, “May your God, whom you serve so faithfully, rescue you.”
DAN.6.17	A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed the stone with his own royal seal and the seals of his nobles, so that no one could rescue Daniel. 
DAN.6.18	Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night fasting. He refused his usual entertainment and couldn’t sleep at all that night.
DAN.6.19	Very early the next morning, the king got up and hurried out to the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.20	When he got there, he called out in anguish, “Daniel, servant of the living God! Was your God, whom you serve so faithfully, able to rescue you from the lions?”
DAN.6.21	Daniel answered, “Long live the king! 
DAN.6.22	My God sent his angel to shut the lions’ mouths so that they would not hurt me, for I have been found innocent in his sight. And I have not wronged you, Your Majesty.”
DAN.6.23	The king was overjoyed and ordered that Daniel be lifted from the den. Not a scratch was found on him, for he had trusted in his God.
DAN.6.24	Then the king gave orders to arrest the men who had maliciously accused Daniel. He had them thrown into the lions’ den, along with their wives and children. The lions leaped on them and tore them apart before they even hit the floor of the den.
DAN.6.25	Then King Darius sent this message to the people of every race and nation and language throughout the world:
DAN.6.25	“Peace and prosperity to you!
DAN.6.26	“I decree that everyone throughout my kingdom should tremble with fear before the God of Daniel.
DAN.6.26	For he is the living God,
DAN.6.26	and he will endure forever.
DAN.6.26	His kingdom will never be destroyed,
DAN.6.26	and his rule will never end.
DAN.6.27	He rescues and saves his people;
DAN.6.27	he performs miraculous signs and wonders
DAN.6.27	in the heavens and on earth.
DAN.6.27	He has rescued Daniel
DAN.6.27	from the power of the lions.”
DAN.6.28	So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
DAN.7.1	Earlier, during the first year of King Belshazzar’s reign in Babylon,
DAN.7.2	In my vision that night, I, Daniel, saw a great storm churning the surface of a great sea, with strong winds blowing from every direction. 
DAN.7.3	Then four huge beasts came up out of the water, each different from the others.
DAN.7.4	The first beast was like a lion with eagles’ wings. As I watched, its wings were pulled off, and it was left standing with its two hind feet on the ground, like a human being. And it was given a human mind.
DAN.7.5	Then I saw a second beast, and it looked like a bear. It was rearing up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And I heard a voice saying to it, “Get up! Devour the flesh of many people!”
DAN.7.6	Then the third of these strange beasts appeared, and it looked like a leopard. It had four bird’s wings on its back, and it had four heads. Great authority was given to this beast.
DAN.7.7	Then in my vision that night, I saw a fourth beast—terrifying, dreadful, and very strong. It devoured and crushed its victims with huge iron teeth and trampled their remains beneath its feet. It was different from any of the other beasts, and it had ten horns.
DAN.7.8	As I was looking at the horns, suddenly another small horn appeared among them. Three of the first horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it. This little horn had eyes like human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly.
DAN.7.9	I watched as thrones were put in place
DAN.7.9	and the Ancient One
DAN.7.9	His clothing was as white as snow,
DAN.7.9	his hair like purest wool.
DAN.7.9	He sat on a fiery throne
DAN.7.9	with wheels of blazing fire,
DAN.7.10	and a river of fire was pouring out,
DAN.7.10	flowing from his presence.
DAN.7.10	Millions of angels ministered to him;
DAN.7.10	many millions stood to attend him.
DAN.7.10	Then the court began its session,
DAN.7.10	and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	I continued to watch because I could hear the little horn’s boastful speech. I kept watching until the fourth beast was killed and its body was destroyed by fire. 
DAN.7.12	The other three beasts had their authority taken from them, but they were allowed to live a while longer.
DAN.7.13	As my vision continued that night, I saw someone like a son of man
DAN.7.14	He was given authority, honor, and sovereignty over all the nations of the world, so that people of every race and nation and language would obey him. His rule is eternal—it will never end. His kingdom will never be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	I, Daniel, was troubled by all I had seen, and my visions terrified me. 
DAN.7.16	So I approached one of those standing beside the throne and asked him what it all meant. He explained it to me like this: 
DAN.7.17	“These four huge beasts represent four kingdoms that will arise from the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But in the end, the holy people of the Most High will be given the kingdom, and they will rule forever and ever.”
DAN.7.19	Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, the one so different from the others and so terrifying. It had devoured and crushed its victims with iron teeth and bronze claws, trampling their remains beneath its feet. 
DAN.7.20	I also asked about the ten horns on the fourth beast’s head and the little horn that came up afterward and destroyed three of the other horns. This horn had seemed greater than the others, and it had human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly. 
DAN.7.21	As I watched, this horn was waging war against God’s holy people and was defeating them, 
DAN.7.22	until the Ancient One—the Most High—came and judged in favor of his holy people. Then the time arrived for the holy people to take over the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	Then he said to me, “This fourth beast is the fourth world power that will rule the earth. It will be different from all the others. It will devour the whole world, trampling and crushing everything in its path. 
DAN.7.24	Its ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another king will arise, different from the other ten, who will subdue three of them. 
DAN.7.25	He will defy the Most High and oppress the holy people of the Most High. He will try to change their sacred festivals and laws, and they will be placed under his control for a time, times, and half a time.
DAN.7.26	“But then the court will pass judgment, and all his power will be taken away and completely destroyed. 
DAN.7.27	Then the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will last forever, and all rulers will serve and obey him.”
DAN.7.28	That was the end of the vision. I, Daniel, was terrified by my thoughts and my face was pale with fear, but I kept these things to myself.
DAN.8.1	During the third year of King Belshazzar’s reign, I, Daniel, saw another vision, following the one that had already appeared to me. 
DAN.8.2	In this vision I was at the fortress of Susa, in the province of Elam, standing beside the Ulai River.
DAN.8.3	As I looked up, I saw a ram with two long horns standing beside the river.
DAN.8.4	The ram butted everything out of his way to the west, to the north, and to the south, and no one could stand against him or help his victims. He did as he pleased and became very great.
DAN.8.5	While I was watching, suddenly a male goat appeared from the west, crossing the land so swiftly that he didn’t even touch the ground. This goat, which had one very large horn between its eyes, 
DAN.8.6	headed toward the two-horned ram that I had seen standing beside the river, rushing at him in a rage. 
DAN.8.7	The goat charged furiously at the ram and struck him, breaking off both his horns. Now the ram was helpless, and the goat knocked him down and trampled him. No one could rescue the ram from the goat’s power.
DAN.8.8	The goat became very powerful. But at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off. In the large horn’s place grew four prominent horns pointing in the four directions of the earth. 
DAN.8.9	Then from one of the prominent horns came a small horn whose power grew very great. It extended toward the south and the east and toward the glorious land of Israel. 
DAN.8.10	Its power reached to the heavens, where it attacked the heavenly army, throwing some of the heavenly beings and some of the stars to the ground and trampling them. 
DAN.8.11	It even challenged the Commander of heaven’s army by canceling the daily sacrifices offered to him and by destroying his Temple. 
DAN.8.12	The army of heaven was restrained from responding to this rebellion. So the daily sacrifice was halted, and truth was overthrown. The horn succeeded in everything it did.
DAN.8.13	Then I heard two holy ones talking to each other. One of them asked, “How long will the events of this vision last? How long will the rebellion that causes desecration stop the daily sacrifices? How long will the Temple and heaven’s army be trampled on?”
DAN.8.14	The other replied, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the Temple will be made right again.”
DAN.8.15	As I, Daniel, was trying to understand the meaning of this vision, someone who looked like a man stood in front of me. 
DAN.8.16	And I heard a human voice calling out from the Ulai River, “Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of his vision.”
DAN.8.17	As Gabriel approached the place where I was standing, I became so terrified that I fell with my face to the ground. “Son of man,” he said, “you must understand that the events you have seen in your vision relate to the time of the end.”
DAN.8.18	While he was speaking, I fainted and lay there with my face to the ground. But Gabriel roused me with a touch and helped me to my feet.
DAN.8.19	Then he said, “I am here to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath. What you have seen pertains to the very end of time. 
DAN.8.20	The two-horned ram represents the kings of Media and Persia. 
DAN.8.21	The shaggy male goat represents the king of Greece,
DAN.8.22	The four prominent horns that replaced the one large horn show that the Greek Empire will break into four kingdoms, but none as great as the first.
DAN.8.23	“At the end of their rule, when their sin is at its height, a fierce king, a master of intrigue, will rise to power. 
DAN.8.24	He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause a shocking amount of destruction and succeed in everything he does. He will destroy powerful leaders and devastate the holy people. 
DAN.8.25	He will be a master of deception and will become arrogant; he will destroy many without warning. He will even take on the Prince of princes in battle, but he will be broken, though not by human power.
DAN.8.26	“This vision about the 2,300 evenings and mornings
DAN.8.27	Then I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for several days. Afterward I got up and performed my duties for the king, but I was greatly troubled by the vision and could not understand it.
DAN.9.1	It was the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede, the son of Ahasuerus, who became king of the Babylonians.
DAN.9.2	During the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, learned from reading the word of the 
DAN.9.3	So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and fasting. I also wore rough burlap and sprinkled myself with ashes.
DAN.9.4	I prayed to the 
DAN.9.4	“O Lord, you are a great and awesome God! You always fulfill your covenant and keep your promises of unfailing love to those who love you and obey your commands. 
DAN.9.5	But we have sinned and done wrong. We have rebelled against you and scorned your commands and regulations. 
DAN.9.6	We have refused to listen to your servants the prophets, who spoke on your authority to our kings and princes and ancestors and to all the people of the land.
DAN.9.7	“Lord, you are in the right; but as you see, our faces are covered with shame. This is true of all of us, including the people of Judah and Jerusalem and all Israel, scattered near and far, wherever you have driven us because of our disloyalty to you. 
DAN.9.8	O 
DAN.9.9	But the Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him. 
DAN.9.10	We have not obeyed the 
DAN.9.11	All Israel has disobeyed your instruction and turned away, refusing to listen to your voice.
DAN.9.11	“So now the solemn curses and judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured down on us because of our sin. 
DAN.9.12	You have kept your word and done to us and our rulers exactly as you warned. Never has there been such a disaster as happened in Jerusalem. 
DAN.9.13	Every curse written against us in the Law of Moses has come true. Yet we have refused to seek mercy from the 
DAN.9.14	Therefore, the 
DAN.9.15	“O Lord our God, you brought lasting honor to your name by rescuing your people from Egypt in a great display of power. But we have sinned and are full of wickedness. 
DAN.9.16	In view of all your faithful mercies, Lord, please turn your furious anger away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. All the neighboring nations mock Jerusalem and your people because of our sins and the sins of our ancestors.
DAN.9.17	“O our God, hear your servant’s prayer! Listen as I plead. For your own sake, Lord, smile again on your desolate sanctuary.
DAN.9.18	“O my God, lean down and listen to me. Open your eyes and see our despair. See how your city—the city that bears your name—lies in ruins. We make this plea, not because we deserve help, but because of your mercy.
DAN.9.19	“O Lord, hear. O Lord, forgive. O Lord, listen and act! For your own sake, do not delay, O my God, for your people and your city bear your name.”
DAN.9.20	I went on praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people, pleading with the 
DAN.9.21	As I was praying, Gabriel, whom I had seen in the earlier vision, came swiftly to me at the time of the evening sacrifice. 
DAN.9.22	He explained to me, “Daniel, I have come here to give you insight and understanding. 
DAN.9.23	The moment you began praying, a command was given. And now I am here to tell you what it was, for you are very precious to God. Listen carefully so that you can understand the meaning of your vision.
DAN.9.24	“A period of seventy sets of seven
DAN.9.25	Now listen and understand! Seven sets of seven plus sixty-two sets of seven
DAN.9.26	“After this period of sixty-two sets of seven,
DAN.9.27	The ruler will make a treaty with the people for a period of one set of seven,
DAN.10.1	In the third year of the reign of King Cyrus of Persia,
DAN.10.2	When this vision came to me, I, Daniel, had been in mourning for three whole weeks. 
DAN.10.3	All that time I had eaten no rich food. No meat or wine crossed my lips, and I used no fragrant lotions until those three weeks had passed.
DAN.10.4	On April 23,
DAN.10.5	I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen clothing, with a belt of pure gold around his waist. 
DAN.10.6	His body looked like a precious gem. His face flashed like lightning, and his eyes flamed like torches. His arms and feet shone like polished bronze, and his voice roared like a vast multitude of people.
DAN.10.7	Only I, Daniel, saw this vision. The men with me saw nothing, but they were suddenly terrified and ran away to hide. 
DAN.10.8	So I was left there all alone to see this amazing vision. My strength left me, my face grew deathly pale, and I felt very weak. 
DAN.10.9	Then I heard the man speak, and when I heard the sound of his voice, I fainted and lay there with my face to the ground.
DAN.10.10	Just then a hand touched me and lifted me, still trembling, to my hands and knees. 
DAN.10.11	And the man said to me, “Daniel, you are very precious to God, so listen carefully to what I have to say to you. Stand up, for I have been sent to you.” When he said this to me, I stood up, still trembling.
DAN.10.12	Then he said, “Don’t be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day you began to pray for understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your request has been heard in heaven. I have come in answer to your prayer. 
DAN.10.13	But for twenty-one days the spirit prince
DAN.10.14	Now I am here to explain what will happen to your people in the future, for this vision concerns a time yet to come.”
DAN.10.15	While he was speaking to me, I looked down at the ground, unable to say a word. 
DAN.10.16	Then the one who looked like a man
DAN.10.17	How can someone like me, your servant, talk to you, my lord? My strength is gone, and I can hardly breathe.”
DAN.10.18	Then the one who looked like a man touched me again, and I felt my strength returning. 
DAN.10.19	“Don’t be afraid,” he said, “for you are very precious to God. Peace! Be encouraged! Be strong!”
DAN.10.19	As he spoke these words to me, I suddenly felt stronger and said to him, “Please speak to me, my lord, for you have strengthened me.”
DAN.10.20	He replied, “Do you know why I have come? Soon I must return to fight against the spirit prince of the kingdom of Persia, and after that the spirit prince of the kingdom of Greece
DAN.10.21	Meanwhile, I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. (No one helps me against these spirit princes except Michael, your spirit prince.
DAN.10.22	I have been standing beside Michael
DAN.11.2	“Now then, I will reveal the truth to you. Three more Persian kings will reign, to be succeeded by a fourth, far richer than the others. He will use his wealth to stir up everyone to fight against the kingdom of Greece.
DAN.11.3	“Then a mighty king will rise to power who will rule with great authority and accomplish everything he sets out to do. 
DAN.11.4	But at the height of his power, his kingdom will be broken apart and divided into four parts. It will not be ruled by the king’s descendants, nor will the kingdom hold the authority it once had. For his empire will be uprooted and given to others.
DAN.11.5	“The king of the south will increase in power, but one of his own officials will become more powerful than he and will rule his kingdom with great strength.
DAN.11.6	“Some years later an alliance will be formed between the king of the north and the king of the south. The daughter of the king of the south will be given in marriage to the king of the north to secure the alliance, but she will lose her influence over him, and so will her father. She will be abandoned along with her supporters. 
DAN.11.7	But when one of her relatives
DAN.11.8	When he returns to Egypt, he will carry back their idols with him, along with priceless articles of gold and silver. For some years afterward he will leave the king of the north alone.
DAN.11.9	“Later the king of the north will invade the realm of the king of the south but will soon return to his own land. 
DAN.11.10	However, the sons of the king of the north will assemble a mighty army that will advance like a flood and carry the battle as far as the enemy’s fortress.
DAN.11.11	“Then, in a rage, the king of the south will rally against the vast forces assembled by the king of the north and will defeat them. 
DAN.11.12	After the enemy army is swept away, the king of the south will be filled with pride and will execute many thousands of his enemies. But his success will be short lived.
DAN.11.13	“A few years later the king of the north will return with a fully equipped army far greater than before. 
DAN.11.14	At that time there will be a general uprising against the king of the south. Violent men among your own people will join them in fulfillment of this vision, but they will not succeed. 
DAN.11.15	Then the king of the north will come and lay siege to a fortified city and capture it. The best troops of the south will not be able to stand in the face of the onslaught.
DAN.11.16	“The king of the north will march onward unopposed; none will be able to stop him. He will pause in the glorious land of Israel,
DAN.11.17	He will make plans to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will form an alliance with the king of the south. He will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom from within, but his plan will fail.
DAN.11.18	“After this, he will turn his attention to the coastland and conquer many cities. But a commander from another land will put an end to his insolence and cause him to retreat in shame. 
DAN.11.19	He will take refuge in his own fortresses but will stumble and fall and be seen no more.
DAN.11.20	“His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. But after a very brief reign, he will die, though not from anger or in battle.
DAN.11.21	“The next to come to power will be a despicable man who is not in line for royal succession. He will slip in when least expected and take over the kingdom by flattery and intrigue. 
DAN.11.22	Before him great armies will be swept away, including a covenant prince. 
DAN.11.23	With deceitful promises, he will make various alliances. He will become strong despite having only a handful of followers. 
DAN.11.24	Without warning he will enter the richest areas of the land. Then he will distribute among his followers the plunder and wealth of the rich—something his predecessors had never done. He will plot the overthrow of strongholds, but this will last for only a short while.
DAN.11.25	“Then he will stir up his courage and raise a great army against the king of the south. The king of the south will go to battle with a mighty army, but to no avail, for there will be plots against him. 
DAN.11.26	His own household will cause his downfall. His army will be swept away, and many will be killed. 
DAN.11.27	Seeking nothing but each other’s harm, these kings will plot against each other at the conference table, attempting to deceive each other. But it will make no difference, for the end will come at the appointed time.
DAN.11.28	“The king of the north will then return home with great riches. On the way he will set himself against the people of the holy covenant, doing much damage before continuing his journey.
DAN.11.29	“Then at the appointed time he will once again invade the south, but this time the result will be different. 
DAN.11.30	For warships from western coastlands
DAN.11.31	“His army will take over the Temple fortress, pollute the sanctuary, put a stop to the daily sacrifices, and set up the sacrilegious object that causes desecration.
DAN.11.32	He will flatter and win over those who have violated the covenant. But the people who know their God will be strong and will resist him.
DAN.11.33	“Wise leaders will give instruction to many, but these teachers will die by fire and sword, or they will be jailed and robbed. 
DAN.11.34	During these persecutions, little help will arrive, and many who join them will not be sincere. 
DAN.11.35	And some of the wise will fall victim to persecution. In this way, they will be refined and cleansed and made pure until the time of the end, for the appointed time is still to come.
DAN.11.36	“The king will do as he pleases, exalting himself and claiming to be greater than every god, even blaspheming the God of gods. He will succeed, but only until the time of wrath is completed. For what has been determined will surely take place. 
DAN.11.37	He will have no respect for the gods of his ancestors, or for the god loved by women, or for any other god, for he will boast that he is greater than them all. 
DAN.11.38	Instead of these, he will worship the god of fortresses—a god his ancestors never knew—and lavish on him gold, silver, precious stones, and expensive gifts. 
DAN.11.39	Claiming this foreign god’s help, he will attack the strongest fortresses. He will honor those who submit to him, appointing them to positions of authority and dividing the land among them as their reward.
DAN.11.40	“Then at the time of the end, the king of the south will attack the king of the north. The king of the north will storm out with chariots, charioteers, and a vast navy. He will invade various lands and sweep through them like a flood. 
DAN.11.41	He will enter the glorious land of Israel,
DAN.11.42	He will conquer many countries, and even Egypt will not escape. 
DAN.11.43	He will gain control over the gold, silver, and treasures of Egypt, and the Libyans and Ethiopians
DAN.11.44	“But then news from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in great anger to destroy and obliterate many. 
DAN.11.45	He will stop between the glorious holy mountain and the sea and will pitch his royal tents. But while he is there, his time will suddenly run out, and no one will help him.
DAN.12.1	“At that time Michael, the archangel
DAN.12.2	Many of those whose bodies lie dead and buried will rise up, some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting disgrace. 
DAN.12.3	Those who are wise will shine as bright as the sky, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever. 
DAN.12.4	But you, Daniel, keep this prophecy a secret; seal up the book until the time of the end, when many will rush here and there, and knowledge will increase.”
DAN.12.5	Then I, Daniel, looked and saw two others standing on opposite banks of the river. 
DAN.12.6	One of them asked the man dressed in linen, who was now standing above the river, “How long will it be until these shocking events are over?”
DAN.12.7	The man dressed in linen, who was standing above the river, raised both his hands toward heaven and took a solemn oath by the One who lives forever, saying, “It will go on for a time, times, and half a time. When the shattering of the holy people has finally come to an end, all these things will have happened.”
DAN.12.8	I heard what he said, but I did not understand what he meant. So I asked, “How will all this finally end, my lord?”
DAN.12.9	But he said, “Go now, Daniel, for what I have said is kept secret and sealed until the time of the end. 
DAN.12.10	Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined by these trials. But the wicked will continue in their wickedness, and none of them will understand. Only those who are wise will know what it means.
DAN.12.11	“From the time the daily sacrifice is stopped and the sacrilegious object that causes desecration
DAN.12.12	And blessed are those who wait and remain until the end of the 1,335 days!
DAN.12.13	“As for you, go your way until the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days, you will rise again to receive the inheritance set aside for you.”
HOS.1.1	The 
HOS.1.2	When the 
HOS.1.3	So Hosea married Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she became pregnant and gave Hosea a son. 
HOS.1.4	And the 
HOS.1.5	I will break its military power in the Jezreel Valley.”
HOS.1.6	Soon Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter. And the 
HOS.1.7	But I will show love to the people of Judah. I will free them from their enemies—not with weapons and armies or horses and charioteers, but by my power as the 
HOS.1.8	After Gomer had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she again became pregnant and gave birth to a second son. 
HOS.1.9	And the 
HOS.1.10	“Yet the time will come when Israel’s people will be like the sands of the seashore—too many to count! Then, at the place where they were told, ‘You are not my people,’ it will be said, ‘You are children of the living God.’ 
HOS.1.11	Then the people of Judah and Israel will unite together. They will choose one leader for themselves, and they will return from exile together. What a day that will be—the day of Jezreel
HOS.1.12	“In that day you will call your brothers Ammi—‘My people.’ And you will call your sisters Ruhamah—‘The ones I love.’
HOS.2.2	“But now bring charges against Israel—your mother—
HOS.2.2	for she is no longer my wife,
HOS.2.2	and I am no longer her husband.
HOS.2.2	Tell her to remove the prostitute’s makeup from her face
HOS.2.2	and the clothing that exposes her breasts.
HOS.2.3	Otherwise, I will strip her as naked
HOS.2.3	as she was on the day she was born.
HOS.2.3	I will leave her to die of thirst,
HOS.2.3	as in a dry and barren wilderness.
HOS.2.4	And I will not love her children,
HOS.2.4	for they were conceived in prostitution.
HOS.2.5	Their mother is a shameless prostitute
HOS.2.5	and became pregnant in a shameful way.
HOS.2.5	She said, ‘I’ll run after other lovers
HOS.2.5	and sell myself to them for food and water,
HOS.2.5	for clothing of wool and linen,
HOS.2.5	and for olive oil and drinks.’
HOS.2.6	“For this reason I will fence her in with thornbushes.
HOS.2.6	I will block her path with a wall
HOS.2.6	to make her lose her way.
HOS.2.7	When she runs after her lovers,
HOS.2.7	she won’t be able to catch them.
HOS.2.7	She will search for them
HOS.2.7	but not find them.
HOS.2.7	Then she will think,
HOS.2.7	‘I might as well return to my husband,
HOS.2.7	for I was better off with him than I am now.’
HOS.2.8	She doesn’t realize it was I who gave her everything she has—
HOS.2.8	the grain, the new wine, the olive oil;
HOS.2.8	I even gave her silver and gold.
HOS.2.8	But she gave all my gifts to Baal.
HOS.2.9	“But now I will take back the ripened grain and new wine
HOS.2.9	I generously provided each harvest season.
HOS.2.9	I will take away the wool and linen clothing
HOS.2.9	I gave her to cover her nakedness.
HOS.2.10	I will strip her naked in public,
HOS.2.10	while all her lovers look on.
HOS.2.10	No one will be able
HOS.2.10	to rescue her from my hands.
HOS.2.11	I will put an end to her annual festivals,
HOS.2.11	her new moon celebrations, and her Sabbath days—
HOS.2.11	all her appointed festivals.
HOS.2.12	I will destroy her grapevines and fig trees,
HOS.2.12	things she claims her lovers gave her.
HOS.2.12	I will let them grow into tangled thickets,
HOS.2.12	where only wild animals will eat the fruit.
HOS.2.13	I will punish her for all those times
HOS.2.13	when she burned incense to her images of Baal,
HOS.2.13	when she put on her earrings and jewels
HOS.2.13	and went out to look for her lovers
HOS.2.13	but forgot all about me,”
HOS.2.13	says the 
HOS.2.14	“But then I will win her back once again.
HOS.2.14	I will lead her into the desert
HOS.2.14	and speak tenderly to her there.
HOS.2.15	I will return her vineyards to her
HOS.2.15	and transform the Valley of Trouble
HOS.2.15	She will give herself to me there,
HOS.2.15	as she did long ago when she was young,
HOS.2.15	when I freed her from her captivity in Egypt.
HOS.2.16	When that day comes,” says the 
HOS.2.16	“you will call me ‘my husband’
HOS.2.16	instead of ‘my master.’
HOS.2.17	O Israel, I will wipe the many names of Baal from your lips,
HOS.2.17	and you will never mention them again.
HOS.2.18	On that day I will make a covenant
HOS.2.18	with all the wild animals and the birds of the sky
HOS.2.18	and the animals that scurry along the ground
HOS.2.18	so they will not harm you.
HOS.2.18	I will remove all weapons of war from the land,
HOS.2.18	all swords and bows,
HOS.2.18	so you can live unafraid
HOS.2.18	in peace and safety.
HOS.2.19	I will make you my wife forever,
HOS.2.19	showing you righteousness and justice,
HOS.2.19	unfailing love and compassion.
HOS.2.20	I will be faithful to you and make you mine,
HOS.2.20	and you will finally know me as the 
HOS.2.21	“In that day, I will answer,”
HOS.2.21	says the 
HOS.2.21	“I will answer the sky as it pleads for clouds.
HOS.2.21	And the sky will answer the earth with rain.
HOS.2.22	Then the earth will answer the thirsty cries
HOS.2.22	of the grain, the grapevines, and the olive trees.
HOS.2.22	And they in turn will answer,
HOS.2.22	‘Jezreel’—‘God plants!’
HOS.2.23	At that time I will plant a crop of Israelites
HOS.2.23	and raise them for myself.
HOS.2.23	I will show love
HOS.2.23	to those I called ‘Not loved.’
HOS.2.23	And to those I called ‘Not my people,’
HOS.2.23	I will say, ‘Now you are my people.’
HOS.2.23	And they will reply, ‘You are our God!’”
HOS.3.1	Then the 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her back for fifteen pieces of silver
HOS.3.3	Then I said to her, “You must live in my house for many days and stop your prostitution. During this time, you will not have sexual relations with anyone, not even with me.
HOS.3.4	This shows that Israel will go a long time without a king or prince, and without sacrifices, sacred pillars, priests,
HOS.3.5	But afterward the people will return and devote themselves to the 
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of the 
HOS.4.1	The 
HOS.4.1	“There is no faithfulness, no kindness,
HOS.4.1	no knowledge of God in your land.
HOS.4.2	You make vows and break them;
HOS.4.2	you kill and steal and commit adultery.
HOS.4.2	There is violence everywhere—
HOS.4.2	one murder after another.
HOS.4.3	That is why your land is in mourning,
HOS.4.3	and everyone is wasting away.
HOS.4.3	Even the wild animals, the birds of the sky,
HOS.4.3	and the fish of the sea are disappearing.
HOS.4.4	“Don’t point your finger at someone else
HOS.4.4	and try to pass the blame!
HOS.4.4	My complaint, you priests,
HOS.4.4	is with you.
HOS.4.5	So you will stumble in broad daylight,
HOS.4.5	and your false prophets will fall with you in the night.
HOS.4.5	And I will destroy Israel, your mother.
HOS.4.6	My people are being destroyed
HOS.4.6	because they don’t know me.
HOS.4.6	Since you priests refuse to know me,
HOS.4.6	I refuse to recognize you as my priests.
HOS.4.6	Since you have forgotten the laws of your God,
HOS.4.6	I will forget to bless your children.
HOS.4.7	The more priests there are,
HOS.4.7	the more they sin against me.
HOS.4.7	They have exchanged the glory of God
HOS.4.7	for the shame of idols.
HOS.4.8	“When the people bring their sin offerings, the priests get fed.
HOS.4.8	So the priests are glad when the people sin!
HOS.4.9	‘And what the priests do, the people also do.’
HOS.4.9	So now I will punish both priests and people
HOS.4.9	for their wicked deeds.
HOS.4.10	They will eat and still be hungry.
HOS.4.10	They will play the prostitute and gain nothing from it,
HOS.4.10	for they have deserted the 
HOS.4.11	to worship other gods.
HOS.4.11	“Wine has robbed my people
HOS.4.11	of their understanding.
HOS.4.12	They ask a piece of wood for advice!
HOS.4.12	They think a stick can tell them the future!
HOS.4.12	Longing after idols
HOS.4.12	has made them foolish.
HOS.4.12	They have played the prostitute,
HOS.4.12	serving other gods and deserting their God.
HOS.4.13	They offer sacrifices to idols on the mountaintops.
HOS.4.13	They go up into the hills to burn incense
HOS.4.13	in the pleasant shade of oaks, poplars, and terebinth trees.
HOS.4.13	“That is why your daughters turn to prostitution,
HOS.4.13	and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
HOS.4.14	But why should I punish them
HOS.4.14	for their prostitution and adultery?
HOS.4.14	For your men are doing the same thing,
HOS.4.14	sinning with whores and shrine prostitutes.
HOS.4.14	O foolish people! You refuse to understand,
HOS.4.14	so you will be destroyed.
HOS.4.15	“Though you, Israel, are a prostitute,
HOS.4.15	may Judah not be guilty of such things.
HOS.4.15	Do not join the false worship at Gilgal or Beth-aven,
HOS.4.15	and do not take oaths there in the 
HOS.4.16	Israel is stubborn,
HOS.4.16	like a stubborn heifer.
HOS.4.16	So should the 
HOS.4.16	like a lamb in a lush pasture?
HOS.4.17	Leave Israel
HOS.4.17	because she is married to idolatry.
HOS.4.18	When the rulers of Israel finish their drinking,
HOS.4.18	off they go to find some prostitutes.
HOS.4.18	They love shame more than honor.
HOS.4.19	So a mighty wind will sweep them away.
HOS.4.19	Their sacrifices to idols will bring them shame.
HOS.5.1	“Hear this, you priests.
HOS.5.1	Pay attention, you leaders of Israel.
HOS.5.1	Listen, you members of the royal family.
HOS.5.1	Judgment has been handed down against you.
HOS.5.1	For you have led the people into a snare
HOS.5.1	by worshiping the idols at Mizpah and Tabor.
HOS.5.2	You have dug a deep pit to trap them at Acacia Grove.
HOS.5.2	But I will settle with you for what you have done.
HOS.5.3	I know what you are like, O Ephraim.
HOS.5.3	You cannot hide yourself from me, O Israel.
HOS.5.3	You have left me as a prostitute leaves her husband;
HOS.5.3	you are utterly defiled.
HOS.5.4	Your deeds won’t let you return to your God.
HOS.5.4	You are a prostitute through and through,
HOS.5.4	and you do not know the 
HOS.5.5	“The arrogance of Israel testifies against her;
HOS.5.5	Israel and Ephraim will stumble under their load of guilt.
HOS.5.5	Judah, too, will fall with them.
HOS.5.6	When they come with their flocks and herds
HOS.5.6	to offer sacrifices to the 
HOS.5.6	they will not find him,
HOS.5.6	because he has withdrawn from them.
HOS.5.7	They have betrayed the honor of the 
HOS.5.7	bearing children that are not his.
HOS.5.7	Now their false religion will devour them
HOS.5.7	along with their wealth.
HOS.5.8	“Sound the alarm in Gibeah!
HOS.5.8	Blow the trumpet in Ramah!
HOS.5.8	Raise the battle cry in Beth-aven
HOS.5.8	Lead on into battle, O warriors of Benjamin!
HOS.5.9	One thing is certain, Israel
HOS.5.9	On your day of punishment,
HOS.5.9	you will become a heap of rubble.
HOS.5.10	“The leaders of Judah have become like thieves.
HOS.5.10	So I will pour my anger on them like a waterfall.
HOS.5.11	The people of Israel will be crushed and broken by my judgment
HOS.5.11	because they are determined to worship idols.
HOS.5.12	I will destroy Israel as a moth consumes wool.
HOS.5.12	I will make Judah as weak as rotten wood.
HOS.5.13	“When Israel and Judah saw how sick they were,
HOS.5.13	Israel turned to Assyria—
HOS.5.13	to the great king there—
HOS.5.13	but he could neither help nor cure them.
HOS.5.14	I will be like a lion to Israel,
HOS.5.14	like a strong young lion to Judah.
HOS.5.14	I will tear them to pieces!
HOS.5.14	I will carry them off,
HOS.5.14	and no one will be left to rescue them.
HOS.5.15	Then I will return to my place
HOS.5.15	until they admit their guilt and turn to me.
HOS.5.15	For as soon as trouble comes,
HOS.5.15	they will earnestly search for me.”
HOS.6.1	“Come, let us return to the 
HOS.6.1	He has torn us to pieces;
HOS.6.1	now he will heal us.
HOS.6.1	He has injured us;
HOS.6.1	now he will bandage our wounds.
HOS.6.2	In just a short time he will restore us,
HOS.6.2	so that we may live in his presence.
HOS.6.3	Oh, that we might know the 
HOS.6.3	Let us press on to know him.
HOS.6.3	He will respond to us as surely as the arrival of dawn
HOS.6.3	or the coming of rains in early spring.”
HOS.6.4	“O Israel
HOS.6.4	what should I do with you?” asks the 
HOS.6.4	“For your love vanishes like the morning mist
HOS.6.4	and disappears like dew in the sunlight.
HOS.6.5	I sent my prophets to cut you to pieces—
HOS.6.5	to slaughter you with my words,
HOS.6.5	with judgments as inescapable as light.
HOS.6.6	I want you to show love,
HOS.6.6	not offer sacrifices.
HOS.6.6	I want you to know me
HOS.6.6	more than I want burnt offerings.
HOS.6.7	But like Adam,
HOS.6.7	and betrayed my trust.
HOS.6.8	“Gilead is a city of sinners,
HOS.6.8	tracked with footprints of blood.
HOS.6.9	Priests form bands of robbers,
HOS.6.9	waiting in ambush for their victims.
HOS.6.9	They murder travelers along the road to Shechem
HOS.6.9	and practice every kind of sin.
HOS.6.10	Yes, I have seen something horrible in Ephraim and Israel:
HOS.6.10	My people are defiled by prostituting themselves with other gods!
HOS.6.11	“O Judah, a harvest of punishment is also waiting for you,
HOS.6.11	though I wanted to restore the fortunes of my people.
HOS.7.1	“I want to heal Israel, but its
HOS.7.1	Samaria is filled with liars.
HOS.7.1	Thieves are on the inside
HOS.7.1	and bandits on the outside!
HOS.7.2	Its people don’t realize
HOS.7.2	that I am watching them.
HOS.7.2	Their sinful deeds are all around them,
HOS.7.2	and I see them all.
HOS.7.3	“The people entertain the king with their wickedness,
HOS.7.3	and the princes laugh at their lies.
HOS.7.4	They are all adulterers,
HOS.7.4	always aflame with lust.
HOS.7.4	They are like an oven that is kept hot
HOS.7.4	while the baker is kneading the dough.
HOS.7.5	On royal holidays, the princes get drunk with wine,
HOS.7.5	carousing with those who mock them.
HOS.7.6	Their hearts are like an oven
HOS.7.6	blazing with intrigue.
HOS.7.6	Their plot smolders
HOS.7.6	and in the morning it breaks out like a raging fire.
HOS.7.7	Burning like an oven,
HOS.7.7	they consume their leaders.
HOS.7.7	They kill their kings one after another,
HOS.7.7	and no one cries to me for help.
HOS.7.8	“The people of Israel mingle with godless foreigners,
HOS.7.8	making themselves as worthless as a half-baked cake!
HOS.7.9	Worshiping foreign gods has sapped their strength,
HOS.7.9	but they don’t even know it.
HOS.7.9	Their hair is gray,
HOS.7.9	but they don’t realize they’re old and weak.
HOS.7.10	Their arrogance testifies against them,
HOS.7.10	yet they don’t return to the 
HOS.7.10	or even try to find him.
HOS.7.11	“The people of Israel have become like silly, witless doves,
HOS.7.11	first calling to Egypt, then flying to Assyria for help.
HOS.7.12	But as they fly about,
HOS.7.12	I will throw my net over them
HOS.7.12	and bring them down like a bird from the sky.
HOS.7.12	I will punish them for all the evil they do.
HOS.7.13	“What sorrow awaits those who have deserted me!
HOS.7.13	Let them die, for they have rebelled against me.
HOS.7.13	I wanted to redeem them,
HOS.7.13	but they have told lies about me.
HOS.7.14	They do not cry out to me with sincere hearts.
HOS.7.14	Instead, they sit on their couches and wail.
HOS.7.14	They cut themselves,
HOS.7.14	and they turn away from me.
HOS.7.15	I trained them and made them strong,
HOS.7.15	yet now they plot evil against me.
HOS.7.16	They look everywhere except to the Most High.
HOS.7.16	They are as useless as a crooked bow.
HOS.7.16	Their leaders will be killed by their enemies
HOS.7.16	because of their insolence toward me.
HOS.7.16	Then the people of Egypt
HOS.7.16	will laugh at them.
HOS.8.1	“Sound the alarm!
HOS.8.1	The enemy descends like an eagle on the people of the 
HOS.8.1	for they have broken my covenant
HOS.8.1	and revolted against my law.
HOS.8.2	Now Israel pleads with me,
HOS.8.2	‘Help us, for you are our God!’
HOS.8.3	But it is too late.
HOS.8.3	The people of Israel have rejected what is good,
HOS.8.3	and now their enemies will chase after them.
HOS.8.4	The people have appointed kings without my consent,
HOS.8.4	and princes without my approval.
HOS.8.4	By making idols for themselves from their silver and gold,
HOS.8.4	they have brought about their own destruction.
HOS.8.5	“O Samaria, I reject this calf—
HOS.8.5	this idol you have made.
HOS.8.5	My fury burns against you.
HOS.8.5	How long will you be incapable of innocence?
HOS.8.6	This calf you worship, O Israel,
HOS.8.6	was crafted by your own hands!
HOS.8.6	It is not God!
HOS.8.6	Therefore, it must be smashed to bits.
HOS.8.7	“They have planted the wind
HOS.8.7	and will harvest the whirlwind.
HOS.8.7	The stalks of grain wither
HOS.8.7	and produce nothing to eat.
HOS.8.7	And even if there is any grain,
HOS.8.7	foreigners will eat it.
HOS.8.8	The people of Israel have been swallowed up;
HOS.8.8	they lie among the nations like an old discarded pot.
HOS.8.9	Like a wild donkey looking for a mate,
HOS.8.9	they have gone up to Assyria.
HOS.8.9	The people of Israel
HOS.8.9	sold themselves to many lovers.
HOS.8.10	But though they have sold themselves to many allies,
HOS.8.10	I will now gather them together for judgment.
HOS.8.10	Then they will writhe
HOS.8.10	under the burden of the great king.
HOS.8.11	“Israel has built many altars to take away sin,
HOS.8.11	but these very altars became places for sinning!
HOS.8.12	Even though I gave them all my laws,
HOS.8.12	they act as if those laws don’t apply to them.
HOS.8.13	The people love to offer sacrifices to me,
HOS.8.13	feasting on the meat,
HOS.8.13	but I do not accept their sacrifices.
HOS.8.13	I will hold my people accountable for their sins,
HOS.8.13	and I will punish them.
HOS.8.13	They will return to Egypt.
HOS.8.14	Israel has forgotten its Maker and built great palaces,
HOS.8.14	and Judah has fortified its cities.
HOS.8.14	Therefore, I will send down fire on their cities
HOS.8.14	and will burn up their fortresses.”
HOS.9.1	O people of Israel,
HOS.9.1	do not rejoice as other nations do.
HOS.9.1	For you have been unfaithful to your God,
HOS.9.1	hiring yourselves out like prostitutes,
HOS.9.1	worshiping other gods on every threshing floor.
HOS.9.2	So now your harvests will be too small to feed you.
HOS.9.2	There will be no grapes for making new wine.
HOS.9.3	You may no longer stay here in the 
HOS.9.3	Instead, you will return to Egypt,
HOS.9.3	and in Assyria you will eat food
HOS.9.3	that is ceremonially unclean.
HOS.9.4	There you will make no offerings of wine to the 
HOS.9.4	None of your sacrifices there will please him.
HOS.9.4	They will be unclean, like food touched by a person in mourning.
HOS.9.4	All who present such sacrifices will be defiled.
HOS.9.4	They may eat this food themselves,
HOS.9.4	but they may not offer it to the 
HOS.9.5	What then will you do on festival days?
HOS.9.5	How will you observe the 
HOS.9.6	Even if you escape destruction from Assyria,
HOS.9.6	Egypt will conquer you, and Memphis
HOS.9.6	Nettles will take over your treasures of silver;
HOS.9.6	thistles will invade your ruined homes.
HOS.9.7	The time of Israel’s punishment has come;
HOS.9.7	the day of payment is here.
HOS.9.7	Soon Israel will know this all too well.
HOS.9.7	Because of your great sin and hostility,
HOS.9.7	you say, “The prophets are crazy
HOS.9.7	and the inspired men are fools!”
HOS.9.8	The prophet is a watchman over Israel
HOS.9.8	yet traps are laid for him wherever he goes.
HOS.9.8	He faces hostility even in the house of God.
HOS.9.9	The things my people do are as depraved
HOS.9.9	as what they did in Gibeah long ago.
HOS.9.9	God will not forget.
HOS.9.9	He will surely punish them for their sins.
HOS.9.10	The 
HOS.9.10	it was like finding fresh grapes in the desert.
HOS.9.10	When I saw your ancestors,
HOS.9.10	it was like seeing the first ripe figs of the season.
HOS.9.10	But then they deserted me for Baal-peor,
HOS.9.10	giving themselves to that shameful idol.
HOS.9.10	Soon they became vile,
HOS.9.10	as vile as the god they worshiped.
HOS.9.11	The glory of Israel will fly away like a bird,
HOS.9.11	for your children will not be born
HOS.9.11	or grow in the womb
HOS.9.11	or even be conceived.
HOS.9.12	Even if you do have children who grow up,
HOS.9.12	I will take them from you.
HOS.9.12	It will be a terrible day when I turn away
HOS.9.12	and leave you alone.
HOS.9.13	I have watched Israel become as beautiful as Tyre.
HOS.9.13	But now Israel will bring out her children for slaughter.”
HOS.9.14	O 
HOS.9.14	I will ask for wombs that don’t give birth
HOS.9.14	and breasts that give no milk.
HOS.9.15	The 
HOS.9.15	there I began to hate them.
HOS.9.15	I will drive them from my land
HOS.9.15	because of their evil actions.
HOS.9.15	I will love them no more
HOS.9.15	because all their leaders are rebels.
HOS.9.16	The people of Israel are struck down.
HOS.9.16	Their roots are dried up,
HOS.9.16	and they will bear no more fruit.
HOS.9.16	And if they give birth,
HOS.9.16	I will slaughter their beloved children.”
HOS.9.17	My God will reject the people of Israel
HOS.9.17	because they will not listen or obey.
HOS.9.17	They will be wanderers,
HOS.9.17	homeless among the nations.
HOS.10.1	How prosperous Israel is—
HOS.10.1	a luxuriant vine loaded with fruit.
HOS.10.1	But the richer the people get,
HOS.10.1	the more pagan altars they build.
HOS.10.1	The more bountiful their harvests,
HOS.10.1	the more beautiful their sacred pillars.
HOS.10.2	The hearts of the people are fickle;
HOS.10.2	they are guilty and must be punished.
HOS.10.2	The 
HOS.10.2	and smash their sacred pillars.
HOS.10.3	Then they will say, “We have no king
HOS.10.3	because we didn’t fear the 
HOS.10.3	But even if we had a king,
HOS.10.3	what could he do for us anyway?”
HOS.10.4	They spout empty words
HOS.10.4	and make covenants they don’t intend to keep.
HOS.10.4	So injustice springs up among them
HOS.10.4	like poisonous weeds in a farmer’s field.
HOS.10.5	The people of Samaria tremble in fear
HOS.10.5	for their calf idol at Beth-aven,
HOS.10.5	and they mourn for it.
HOS.10.5	Though its priests rejoice over it,
HOS.10.5	its glory will be stripped away.
HOS.10.6	This idol will be carted away to Assyria,
HOS.10.6	a gift to the great king there.
HOS.10.6	Ephraim will be ridiculed and Israel will be shamed,
HOS.10.6	because its people have trusted in this idol.
HOS.10.7	Samaria and its king will be cut off;
HOS.10.7	they will float away like driftwood on an ocean wave.
HOS.10.8	And the pagan shrines of Aven,
HOS.10.8	Thorns and thistles will grow up around their altars.
HOS.10.8	They will beg the mountains, “Bury us!”
HOS.10.8	and plead with the hills, “Fall on us!”
HOS.10.9	The 
HOS.10.9	there has been only sin and more sin!
HOS.10.9	You have made no progress whatsoever.
HOS.10.9	Was it not right that the wicked men of Gibeah were attacked?
HOS.10.10	Now whenever it fits my plan,
HOS.10.10	I will attack you, too.
HOS.10.10	I will call out the armies of the nations
HOS.10.10	to punish you for your multiplied sins.
HOS.10.11	“Israel
HOS.10.11	an easy job she loves.
HOS.10.11	But I will put a heavy yoke on her tender neck.
HOS.10.11	I will force Judah to pull the plow
HOS.10.11	and Israel
HOS.10.12	I said, ‘Plant the good seeds of righteousness,
HOS.10.12	and you will harvest a crop of love.
HOS.10.12	Plow up the hard ground of your hearts,
HOS.10.12	for now is the time to seek the 
HOS.10.12	that he may come
HOS.10.12	and shower righteousness upon you.’
HOS.10.13	“But you have cultivated wickedness
HOS.10.13	and harvested a thriving crop of sins.
HOS.10.13	You have eaten the fruit of lies—
HOS.10.13	trusting in your military might,
HOS.10.13	believing that great armies
HOS.10.13	could make your nation safe.
HOS.10.14	Now the terrors of war
HOS.10.14	will rise among your people.
HOS.10.14	All your fortifications will fall,
HOS.10.14	just as when Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel.
HOS.10.14	Even mothers and children
HOS.10.14	were dashed to death there.
HOS.10.15	You will share that fate, Bethel,
HOS.10.15	because of your great wickedness.
HOS.10.15	When the day of judgment dawns,
HOS.10.15	the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.
HOS.11.1	“When Israel was a child, I loved him,
HOS.11.1	and I called my son out of Egypt.
HOS.11.2	But the more I called to him,
HOS.11.2	the farther he moved from me,
HOS.11.2	offering sacrifices to the images of Baal
HOS.11.2	and burning incense to idols.
HOS.11.3	I myself taught Israel
HOS.11.3	leading him along by the hand.
HOS.11.3	But he doesn’t know or even care
HOS.11.3	that it was I who took care of him.
HOS.11.4	I led Israel along
HOS.11.4	with my ropes of kindness and love.
HOS.11.4	I lifted the yoke from his neck,
HOS.11.4	and I myself stooped to feed him.
HOS.11.5	“But since my people refuse to return to me,
HOS.11.5	they will return to Egypt
HOS.11.5	and will be forced to serve Assyria.
HOS.11.6	War will swirl through their cities;
HOS.11.6	their enemies will crash through their gates.
HOS.11.6	They will destroy them,
HOS.11.6	trapping them in their own evil plans.
HOS.11.7	For my people are determined to desert me.
HOS.11.7	They call me the Most High,
HOS.11.7	but they don’t truly honor me.
HOS.11.8	“Oh, how can I give you up, Israel?
HOS.11.8	How can I let you go?
HOS.11.8	How can I destroy you like Admah
HOS.11.8	or demolish you like Zeboiim?
HOS.11.8	My heart is torn within me,
HOS.11.8	and my compassion overflows.
HOS.11.9	No, I will not unleash my fierce anger.
HOS.11.9	I will not completely destroy Israel,
HOS.11.9	for I am God and not a mere mortal.
HOS.11.9	I am the Holy One living among you,
HOS.11.9	and I will not come to destroy.
HOS.11.10	For someday the people will follow me.
HOS.11.10	I, the 
HOS.11.10	And when I roar,
HOS.11.10	my people will return trembling from the west.
HOS.11.11	Like a flock of birds, they will come from Egypt.
HOS.11.11	Trembling like doves, they will return from Assyria.
HOS.11.11	And I will bring them home again,”
HOS.11.11	says the 
HOS.11.12	Israel surrounds me with lies and deceit,
HOS.11.12	but Judah still obeys God
HOS.11.12	and is faithful to the Holy One.
HOS.12.1	The people of Israel
HOS.12.1	they chase after the east wind all day long.
HOS.12.1	They pile up lies and violence;
HOS.12.1	they are making an alliance with Assyria
HOS.12.1	while sending olive oil to buy support from Egypt.
HOS.12.2	Now the 
HOS.12.2	He is about to punish Jacob
HOS.12.2	and pay him back for all he has done.
HOS.12.3	Even in the womb,
HOS.12.3	Jacob struggled with his brother;
HOS.12.3	when he became a man,
HOS.12.3	he even fought with God.
HOS.12.4	Yes, he wrestled with the angel and won.
HOS.12.4	He wept and pleaded for a blessing from him.
HOS.12.4	There at Bethel he met God face to face,
HOS.12.4	and God spoke to him
HOS.12.5	the 
HOS.12.5	the 
HOS.12.6	So now, come back to your God.
HOS.12.6	Act with love and justice,
HOS.12.6	and always depend on him.
HOS.12.7	But no, the people are like crafty merchants
HOS.12.7	selling from dishonest scales—
HOS.12.7	they love to cheat.
HOS.12.8	Israel boasts, “I am rich!
HOS.12.8	I’ve made a fortune all by myself!
HOS.12.8	No one has caught me cheating!
HOS.12.8	My record is spotless!”
HOS.12.9	“But I am the 
HOS.12.9	who rescued you from slavery in Egypt.
HOS.12.9	And I will make you live in tents again,
HOS.12.9	as you do each year at the Festival of Shelters.
HOS.12.10	I sent my prophets to warn you
HOS.12.10	with many visions and parables.”
HOS.12.11	But the people of Gilead are worthless
HOS.12.11	because of their idol worship.
HOS.12.11	And in Gilgal, too, they sacrifice bulls;
HOS.12.11	their altars are lined up like the heaps of stone
HOS.12.11	along the edges of a plowed field.
HOS.12.12	Jacob fled to the land of Aram,
HOS.12.12	and there he
HOS.12.13	Then by a prophet
HOS.12.13	the 
HOS.12.13	and by that prophet
HOS.12.13	they were protected.
HOS.12.14	But the people of Israel
HOS.12.14	have bitterly provoked the 
HOS.12.14	so their Lord will now sentence them to death
HOS.12.14	in payment for their sins.
HOS.13.1	When the tribe of Ephraim spoke,
HOS.13.1	the people shook with fear,
HOS.13.1	for that tribe was important in Israel.
HOS.13.1	But the people of Ephraim sinned by worshiping Baal
HOS.13.1	and thus sealed their destruction.
HOS.13.2	Now they continue to sin by making silver idols,
HOS.13.2	images shaped skillfully with human hands.
HOS.13.2	“Sacrifice to these,” they cry,
HOS.13.2	“and kiss the calf idols!”
HOS.13.3	Therefore, they will disappear like the morning mist,
HOS.13.3	like dew in the morning sun,
HOS.13.3	like chaff blown by the wind,
HOS.13.3	like smoke from a chimney.
HOS.13.4	“I have been the 
HOS.13.4	ever since I brought you out of Egypt.
HOS.13.4	You must acknowledge no God but me,
HOS.13.4	for there is no other savior.
HOS.13.5	I took care of you in the wilderness,
HOS.13.5	in that dry and thirsty land.
HOS.13.6	But when you had eaten and were satisfied,
HOS.13.6	you became proud and forgot me.
HOS.13.7	So now I will attack you like a lion,
HOS.13.7	like a leopard that lurks along the road.
HOS.13.8	Like a bear whose cubs have been taken away,
HOS.13.8	I will tear out your heart.
HOS.13.8	I will devour you like a hungry lioness
HOS.13.8	and mangle you like a wild animal.
HOS.13.9	“You are about to be destroyed, O Israel—
HOS.13.9	yes, by me, your only helper.
HOS.13.10	Now where is
HOS.13.10	Let him save you!
HOS.13.10	Where are all the leaders of the land,
HOS.13.10	the king and the officials you demanded of me?
HOS.13.11	In my anger I gave you kings,
HOS.13.11	and in my fury I took them away.
HOS.13.12	“Ephraim’s guilt has been collected,
HOS.13.12	and his sin has been stored up for punishment.
HOS.13.13	Pain has come to the people
HOS.13.13	like the pain of childbirth,
HOS.13.13	but they are like a child
HOS.13.13	who resists being born.
HOS.13.13	The moment of birth has arrived,
HOS.13.13	but they stay in the womb!
HOS.13.14	“Should I ransom them from the grave
HOS.13.14	Should I redeem them from death?
HOS.13.14	O death, bring on your terrors!
HOS.13.14	O grave, bring on your plagues!
HOS.13.14	For I will not take pity on them.
HOS.13.15	Ephraim was the most fruitful of all his brothers,
HOS.13.15	but the east wind—a blast from the 
HOS.13.15	will arise in the desert.
HOS.13.15	All their flowing springs will run dry,
HOS.13.15	and all their wells will disappear.
HOS.13.15	Every precious thing they own
HOS.13.15	will be plundered and carried away.
HOS.13.16	The people of Samaria
HOS.13.16	must bear the consequences of their guilt
HOS.13.16	because they rebelled against their God.
HOS.13.16	They will be killed by an invading army,
HOS.13.16	their little ones dashed to death against the ground,
HOS.13.16	their pregnant women ripped open by swords.”
HOS.14.1	Return, O Israel, to the 
HOS.14.1	for your sins have brought you down.
HOS.14.2	Bring your confessions, and return to the 
HOS.14.2	Say to him,
HOS.14.2	“Forgive all our sins and graciously receive us,
HOS.14.2	so that we may offer you our praises.
HOS.14.3	Assyria cannot save us,
HOS.14.3	nor can our warhorses.
HOS.14.3	Never again will we say to the idols we have made,
HOS.14.3	‘You are our gods.’
HOS.14.3	No, in you alone
HOS.14.3	do the orphans find mercy.”
HOS.14.4	The 
HOS.14.4	“Then I will heal you of your faithlessness;
HOS.14.4	my love will know no bounds,
HOS.14.4	for my anger will be gone forever.
HOS.14.5	I will be to Israel
HOS.14.5	like a refreshing dew from heaven.
HOS.14.5	Israel will blossom like the lily;
HOS.14.5	it will send roots deep into the soil
HOS.14.5	like the cedars in Lebanon.
HOS.14.6	Its branches will spread out like beautiful olive trees,
HOS.14.6	as fragrant as the cedars of Lebanon.
HOS.14.7	My people will again live under my shade.
HOS.14.7	They will flourish like grain and blossom like grapevines.
HOS.14.7	They will be as fragrant as the wines of Lebanon.
HOS.14.8	“O Israel,
HOS.14.8	I am the one who answers your prayers and cares for you.
HOS.14.8	I am like a tree that is always green;
HOS.14.8	all your fruit comes from me.”
HOS.14.9	Let those who are wise understand these things.
HOS.14.9	Let those with discernment listen carefully.
HOS.14.9	The paths of the 
HOS.14.9	and righteous people live by walking in them.
HOS.14.9	But in those paths sinners stumble and fall.
JOL.1.1	The 
JOL.1.2	Hear this, you leaders of the people.
JOL.1.2	Listen, all who live in the land.
JOL.1.2	In all your history,
JOL.1.2	has anything like this happened before?
JOL.1.3	Tell your children about it in the years to come,
JOL.1.3	and let your children tell their children.
JOL.1.3	Pass the story down from generation to generation.
JOL.1.4	After the cutting locusts finished eating the crops,
JOL.1.4	the swarming locusts took what was left!
JOL.1.4	After them came the hopping locusts,
JOL.1.4	and then the stripping locusts,
JOL.1.5	Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!
JOL.1.5	Wail, all you wine-drinkers!
JOL.1.5	All the grapes are ruined,
JOL.1.5	and all your sweet wine is gone.
JOL.1.6	A vast army of locusts
JOL.1.6	a terrible army too numerous to count.
JOL.1.6	Its teeth are like lions’ teeth,
JOL.1.6	its fangs like those of a lioness.
JOL.1.7	It has destroyed my grapevines
JOL.1.7	and ruined my fig trees,
JOL.1.7	stripping their bark and destroying it,
JOL.1.7	leaving the branches white and bare.
JOL.1.8	Weep like a bride dressed in black,
JOL.1.8	mourning the death of her husband.
JOL.1.9	For there is no grain or wine
JOL.1.9	to offer at the Temple of the 
JOL.1.9	So the priests are in mourning.
JOL.1.9	The ministers of the 
JOL.1.10	The fields are ruined,
JOL.1.10	the land is stripped bare.
JOL.1.10	The grain is destroyed,
JOL.1.10	the grapes have shriveled,
JOL.1.10	and the olive oil is gone.
JOL.1.11	Despair, all you farmers!
JOL.1.11	Wail, all you vine growers!
JOL.1.11	Weep, because the wheat and barley—
JOL.1.11	all the crops of the field—are ruined.
JOL.1.12	The grapevines have dried up,
JOL.1.12	and the fig trees have withered.
JOL.1.12	The pomegranate trees, palm trees, and apple trees—
JOL.1.12	all the fruit trees—have dried up.
JOL.1.12	And the people’s joy has dried up with them.
JOL.1.13	Dress yourselves in burlap and weep, you priests!
JOL.1.13	Wail, you who serve before the altar!
JOL.1.13	Come, spend the night in burlap,
JOL.1.13	you ministers of my God.
JOL.1.13	For there is no grain or wine
JOL.1.13	to offer at the Temple of your God.
JOL.1.14	Announce a time of fasting;
JOL.1.14	call the people together for a solemn meeting.
JOL.1.14	Bring the leaders
JOL.1.14	and all the people of the land
JOL.1.14	into the Temple of the 
JOL.1.14	and cry out to him there.
JOL.1.15	The day of the 
JOL.1.15	the day when destruction comes from the Almighty.
JOL.1.15	How terrible that day will be!
JOL.1.16	Our food disappears before our very eyes.
JOL.1.16	No joyful celebrations are held in the house of our God.
JOL.1.17	The seeds die in the parched ground,
JOL.1.17	and the grain crops fail.
JOL.1.17	The barns stand empty,
JOL.1.17	and granaries are abandoned.
JOL.1.18	How the animals moan with hunger!
JOL.1.18	The herds of cattle wander about confused,
JOL.1.18	because they have no pasture.
JOL.1.18	The flocks of sheep and goats bleat in misery.
JOL.1.19	, help us!
JOL.1.19	The fire has consumed the wilderness pastures,
JOL.1.19	and flames have burned up all the trees.
JOL.1.20	Even the wild animals cry out to you
JOL.1.20	because the streams have dried up,
JOL.1.20	and fire has consumed the wilderness pastures.
JOL.2.1	Sound the trumpet in Jerusalem
JOL.2.1	Raise the alarm on my holy mountain!
JOL.2.1	Let everyone tremble in fear
JOL.2.1	because the day of the 
JOL.2.2	It is a day of darkness and gloom,
JOL.2.2	a day of thick clouds and deep blackness.
JOL.2.2	Suddenly, like dawn spreading across the mountains,
JOL.2.2	a great and mighty army appears.
JOL.2.2	Nothing like it has been seen before
JOL.2.2	or will ever be seen again.
JOL.2.3	Fire burns in front of them,
JOL.2.3	and flames follow after them.
JOL.2.3	Ahead of them the land lies
JOL.2.3	as beautiful as the Garden of Eden.
JOL.2.3	Behind them is nothing but desolation;
JOL.2.3	not one thing escapes.
JOL.2.4	They look like horses;
JOL.2.4	they charge forward like warhorses.
JOL.2.5	Look at them as they leap along the mountaintops.
JOL.2.5	Listen to the noise they make—like the rumbling of chariots,
JOL.2.5	like the roar of fire sweeping across a field of stubble,
JOL.2.5	or like a mighty army moving into battle.
JOL.2.6	Fear grips all the people;
JOL.2.6	every face grows pale with terror.
JOL.2.7	The attackers march like warriors
JOL.2.7	and scale city walls like soldiers.
JOL.2.7	Straight forward they march,
JOL.2.7	never breaking rank.
JOL.2.8	They never jostle each other;
JOL.2.8	each moves in exactly the right position.
JOL.2.8	They break through defenses
JOL.2.8	without missing a step.
JOL.2.9	They swarm over the city
JOL.2.9	and run along its walls.
JOL.2.9	They enter all the houses,
JOL.2.9	climbing like thieves through the windows.
JOL.2.10	The earth quakes as they advance,
JOL.2.10	and the heavens tremble.
JOL.2.10	The sun and moon grow dark,
JOL.2.10	and the stars no longer shine.
JOL.2.11	The 
JOL.2.11	He leads them with a shout.
JOL.2.11	This is his mighty army,
JOL.2.11	and they follow his orders.
JOL.2.11	The day of the 
JOL.2.11	Who can possibly survive?
JOL.2.12	That is why the 
JOL.2.12	“Turn to me now, while there is time.
JOL.2.12	Give me your hearts.
JOL.2.12	Come with fasting, weeping, and mourning.
JOL.2.13	Don’t tear your clothing in your grief,
JOL.2.13	but tear your hearts instead.”
JOL.2.13	Return to the 
JOL.2.13	for he is merciful and compassionate,
JOL.2.13	slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love.
JOL.2.13	He is eager to relent and not punish.
JOL.2.14	Who knows? Perhaps he will give you a reprieve,
JOL.2.14	sending you a blessing instead of this curse.
JOL.2.14	Perhaps you will be able to offer grain and wine
JOL.2.14	to the 
JOL.2.15	Blow the ram’s horn in Jerusalem!
JOL.2.15	Announce a time of fasting;
JOL.2.15	call the people together
JOL.2.15	for a solemn meeting.
JOL.2.16	Gather all the people—
JOL.2.16	the elders, the children, and even the babies.
JOL.2.16	Call the bridegroom from his quarters
JOL.2.16	and the bride from her private room.
JOL.2.17	Let the priests, who minister in the 
JOL.2.17	stand and weep between the entry room to the Temple and the altar.
JOL.2.17	Let them pray, “Spare your people, 
JOL.2.17	Don’t let your special possession become an object of mockery.
JOL.2.17	Don’t let them become a joke for unbelieving foreigners who say,
JOL.2.17	‘Has the God of Israel left them?’”
JOL.2.18	Then the 
JOL.2.18	and jealously guard the honor of his land.
JOL.2.19	The 
JOL.2.19	“Look! I am sending you grain and new wine and olive oil,
JOL.2.19	enough to satisfy your needs.
JOL.2.19	You will no longer be an object of mockery
JOL.2.19	among the surrounding nations.
JOL.2.20	I will drive away these armies from the north.
JOL.2.20	I will send them into the parched wastelands.
JOL.2.20	Those in the front will be driven into the Dead Sea,
JOL.2.20	and those at the rear into the Mediterranean.
JOL.2.20	The stench of their rotting bodies will rise over the land.”
JOL.2.20	Surely the 
JOL.2.21	Don’t be afraid, O land.
JOL.2.21	Be glad now and rejoice,
JOL.2.21	for the 
JOL.2.22	Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field,
JOL.2.22	for the wilderness pastures will soon be green.
JOL.2.22	The trees will again be filled with fruit;
JOL.2.22	fig trees and grapevines will be loaded down once more.
JOL.2.23	Rejoice, you people of Jerusalem!
JOL.2.23	Rejoice in the 
JOL.2.23	For the rain he sends demonstrates his faithfulness.
JOL.2.23	Once more the autumn rains will come,
JOL.2.23	as well as the rains of spring.
JOL.2.24	The threshing floors will again be piled high with grain,
JOL.2.24	and the presses will overflow with new wine and olive oil.
JOL.2.25	The 
JOL.2.25	to the swarming locusts, the hopping locusts,
JOL.2.25	the stripping locusts, and the cutting locusts.
JOL.2.25	It was I who sent this great destroying army against you.
JOL.2.26	Once again you will have all the food you want,
JOL.2.26	and you will praise the 
JOL.2.26	who does these miracles for you.
JOL.2.26	Never again will my people be disgraced.
JOL.2.27	Then you will know that I am among my people Israel,
JOL.2.27	that I am the 
JOL.2.27	Never again will my people be disgraced.
JOL.2.28	“Then, after doing all those things,
JOL.2.28	I will pour out my Spirit upon all people.
JOL.2.28	Your sons and daughters will prophesy.
JOL.2.28	Your old men will dream dreams,
JOL.2.28	and your young men will see visions.
JOL.2.29	In those days I will pour out my Spirit
JOL.2.29	even on servants—men and women alike.
JOL.2.30	And I will cause wonders in the heavens and on the earth—
JOL.2.30	blood and fire and columns of smoke.
JOL.2.31	The sun will become dark,
JOL.2.31	and the moon will turn blood red
JOL.2.31	before that great and terrible
JOL.2.32	But everyone who calls on the name of the 
JOL.2.32	will be saved,
JOL.2.32	for some on Mount Zion in Jerusalem will escape,
JOL.2.32	just as the 
JOL.2.32	These will be among the survivors
JOL.2.32	whom the 
JOL.3.1	“At the time of those events,” says the 
JOL.3.1	“when I restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem,
JOL.3.2	I will gather the armies of the world
JOL.3.2	into the valley of Jehoshaphat.
JOL.3.2	There I will judge them
JOL.3.2	for harming my people, my special possession,
JOL.3.2	for scattering my people among the nations,
JOL.3.2	and for dividing up my land.
JOL.3.3	They threw dice
JOL.3.3	would be their slaves.
JOL.3.3	They traded boys to obtain prostitutes
JOL.3.3	and sold girls for enough wine to get drunk.
JOL.3.4	“What do you have against me, Tyre and Sidon and you cities of Philistia? Are you trying to take revenge on me? If you are, then watch out! I will strike swiftly and pay you back for everything you have done. 
JOL.3.5	You have taken my silver and gold and all my precious treasures, and have carried them off to your pagan temples. 
JOL.3.6	You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks,
JOL.3.7	“But I will bring them back from all the places to which you sold them, and I will pay you back for everything you have done. 
JOL.3.8	I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the people of Arabia,
JOL.3.9	Say to the nations far and wide:
JOL.3.9	“Get ready for war!
JOL.3.9	Call out your best warriors.
JOL.3.9	Let all your fighting men advance for the attack.
JOL.3.10	Hammer your plowshares into swords
JOL.3.10	and your pruning hooks into spears.
JOL.3.10	Train even your weaklings to be warriors.
JOL.3.11	Come quickly, all you nations everywhere.
JOL.3.11	Gather together in the valley.”
JOL.3.11	And now, O 
JOL.3.12	“Let the nations be called to arms.
JOL.3.12	Let them march to the valley of Jehoshaphat.
JOL.3.12	There I, the 
JOL.3.12	to pronounce judgment on them all.
JOL.3.13	Swing the sickle,
JOL.3.13	for the harvest is ripe.
JOL.3.13	Come, tread the grapes,
JOL.3.13	for the winepress is full.
JOL.3.13	The storage vats are overflowing
JOL.3.13	with the wickedness of these people.”
JOL.3.14	Thousands upon thousands are waiting in the valley of decision.
JOL.3.14	There the day of the 
JOL.3.15	The sun and moon will grow dark,
JOL.3.15	and the stars will no longer shine.
JOL.3.16	The 
JOL.3.16	and thunder from Jerusalem,
JOL.3.16	and the heavens and the earth will shake.
JOL.3.16	But the 
JOL.3.16	a strong fortress for the people of Israel.
JOL.3.17	“Then you will know that I, the 
JOL.3.17	live in Zion, my holy mountain.
JOL.3.17	Jerusalem will be holy forever,
JOL.3.17	and foreign armies will never conquer her again.
JOL.3.18	In that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
JOL.3.18	and the hills will flow with milk.
JOL.3.18	Water will fill the streambeds of Judah,
JOL.3.18	and a fountain will burst forth from the 
JOL.3.18	watering the arid valley of acacias.
JOL.3.19	But Egypt will become a wasteland
JOL.3.19	and Edom will become a wilderness,
JOL.3.19	because they attacked the people of Judah
JOL.3.19	and killed innocent people in their land.
JOL.3.20	“But Judah will be filled with people forever,
JOL.3.20	and Jerusalem will endure through all generations.
JOL.3.21	I will pardon my people’s crimes,
JOL.3.21	which I have not yet pardoned;
JOL.3.21	and I, the 
JOL.3.21	in Jerusalem
AMO.1.1	This message was given to Amos, a shepherd from the town of Tekoa in Judah. He received this message in visions two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam II, the son of Jehoash,
AMO.1.2	This is what he saw and heard:
AMO.1.2	“The 
AMO.1.2	and thunder from Jerusalem!
AMO.1.2	The lush pastures of the shepherds will dry up;
AMO.1.2	the grass on Mount Carmel will wither and die.”
AMO.1.3	This is what the 
AMO.1.3	“The people of Damascus have sinned again and again,
AMO.1.3	and I will not let them go unpunished!
AMO.1.3	They beat down my people in Gilead
AMO.1.3	as grain is threshed with iron sledges.
AMO.1.4	So I will send down fire on King Hazael’s palace,
AMO.1.4	and the fortresses of King Ben-hadad will be destroyed.
AMO.1.5	I will break down the gates of Damascus
AMO.1.5	and slaughter the people in the valley of Aven.
AMO.1.5	I will destroy the ruler in Beth-eden,
AMO.1.5	and the people of Aram will go as captives to Kir,”
AMO.1.5	says the 
AMO.1.6	This is what the 
AMO.1.6	“The people of Gaza have sinned again and again,
AMO.1.6	and I will not let them go unpunished!
AMO.1.6	They sent whole villages into exile,
AMO.1.6	selling them as slaves to Edom.
AMO.1.7	So I will send down fire on the walls of Gaza,
AMO.1.7	and all its fortresses will be destroyed.
AMO.1.8	I will slaughter the people of Ashdod
AMO.1.8	and destroy the king of Ashkelon.
AMO.1.8	Then I will turn to attack Ekron,
AMO.1.8	and the few Philistines still left will be killed,”
AMO.1.8	says the Sovereign 
AMO.1.9	This is what the 
AMO.1.9	“The people of Tyre have sinned again and again,
AMO.1.9	and I will not let them go unpunished!
AMO.1.9	They broke their treaty of brotherhood with Israel,
AMO.1.9	selling whole villages as slaves to Edom.
AMO.1.10	So I will send down fire on the walls of Tyre,
AMO.1.10	and all its fortresses will be destroyed.”
AMO.1.11	This is what the 
AMO.1.11	“The people of Edom have sinned again and again,
AMO.1.11	and I will not let them go unpunished!
AMO.1.11	They chased down their relatives, the Israelites, with swords,
AMO.1.11	showing them no mercy.
AMO.1.11	In their rage, they slashed them continually
AMO.1.11	and were unrelenting in their anger.
AMO.1.12	So I will send down fire on Teman,
AMO.1.12	and the fortresses of Bozrah will be destroyed.”
AMO.1.13	This is what the 
AMO.1.13	“The people of Ammon have sinned again and again,
AMO.1.13	and I will not let them go unpunished!
AMO.1.13	When they attacked Gilead to extend their borders,
AMO.1.13	they ripped open pregnant women with their swords.
AMO.1.14	So I will send down fire on the walls of Rabbah,
AMO.1.14	and all its fortresses will be destroyed.
AMO.1.14	The battle will come upon them with shouts,
AMO.1.14	like a whirlwind in a mighty storm.
AMO.1.15	And their king
AMO.1.15	says the 
AMO.2.1	This is what the 
AMO.2.1	“The people of Moab have sinned again and again,
AMO.2.1	and I will not let them go unpunished!
AMO.2.1	They desecrated the bones of Edom’s king,
AMO.2.1	burning them to ashes.
AMO.2.2	So I will send down fire on the land of Moab,
AMO.2.2	and all the fortresses in Kerioth will be destroyed.
AMO.2.2	The people will fall in the noise of battle,
AMO.2.2	as the warriors shout and the ram’s horn sounds.
AMO.2.3	And I will destroy their king
AMO.2.3	and slaughter all their princes,”
AMO.2.3	says the 
AMO.2.4	This is what the 
AMO.2.4	“The people of Judah have sinned again and again,
AMO.2.4	and I will not let them go unpunished!
AMO.2.4	They have rejected the instruction of the 
AMO.2.4	refusing to obey his decrees.
AMO.2.4	They have been led astray by the same lies
AMO.2.4	that deceived their ancestors.
AMO.2.5	So I will send down fire on Judah,
AMO.2.5	and all the fortresses of Jerusalem will be destroyed.”
AMO.2.6	This is what the 
AMO.2.6	“The people of Israel have sinned again and again,
AMO.2.6	and I will not let them go unpunished!
AMO.2.6	They sell honorable people for silver
AMO.2.6	and poor people for a pair of sandals.
AMO.2.7	They trample helpless people in the dust
AMO.2.7	and shove the oppressed out of the way.
AMO.2.7	Both father and son sleep with the same woman,
AMO.2.7	corrupting my holy name.
AMO.2.8	At their religious festivals,
AMO.2.8	they lounge in clothing their debtors put up as security.
AMO.2.8	In the house of their gods,
AMO.2.8	they drink wine bought with unjust fines.
AMO.2.9	“But as my people watched,
AMO.2.9	I destroyed the Amorites,
AMO.2.9	though they were as tall as cedars
AMO.2.9	and as strong as oaks.
AMO.2.9	I destroyed the fruit on their branches
AMO.2.9	and dug out their roots.
AMO.2.10	It was I who rescued you from Egypt
AMO.2.10	and led you through the desert for forty years,
AMO.2.10	so you could possess the land of the Amorites.
AMO.2.11	I chose some of your sons to be prophets
AMO.2.11	and others to be Nazirites.
AMO.2.11	Can you deny this, my people of Israel?”
AMO.2.11	asks the 
AMO.2.12	“But you caused the Nazirites to sin by making them drink wine,
AMO.2.12	and you commanded the prophets, ‘Shut up!’
AMO.2.13	“So I will make you groan
AMO.2.13	like a wagon loaded down with sheaves of grain.
AMO.2.14	Your fastest runners will not get away.
AMO.2.14	The strongest among you will become weak.
AMO.2.14	Even mighty warriors will be unable to save themselves.
AMO.2.15	The archers will not stand their ground.
AMO.2.15	The swiftest runners won’t be fast enough to escape.
AMO.2.15	Even those riding horses won’t be able to save themselves.
AMO.2.16	On that day the most courageous of your fighting men
AMO.2.16	will drop their weapons and run for their lives,”
AMO.2.16	says the 
AMO.3.1	Listen to this message that the 
AMO.3.2	“From among all the families on the earth,
AMO.3.2	I have been intimate with you alone.
AMO.3.2	That is why I must punish you
AMO.3.2	for all your sins.”
AMO.3.3	Can two people walk together
AMO.3.3	without agreeing on the direction?
AMO.3.4	Does a lion ever roar in a thicket
AMO.3.4	without first finding a victim?
AMO.3.4	Does a young lion growl in its den
AMO.3.4	without first catching its prey?
AMO.3.5	Does a bird ever get caught in a trap
AMO.3.5	that has no bait?
AMO.3.5	Does a trap spring shut
AMO.3.5	when there’s nothing to catch?
AMO.3.6	When the ram’s horn blows a warning,
AMO.3.6	shouldn’t the people be alarmed?
AMO.3.6	Does disaster come to a city
AMO.3.6	unless the 
AMO.3.7	Indeed, the Sovereign 
AMO.3.7	until he reveals his plans to his servants the prophets.
AMO.3.8	The lion has roared—
AMO.3.8	so who isn’t frightened?
AMO.3.8	The Sovereign 
AMO.3.8	so who can refuse to proclaim his message?
AMO.3.9	Announce this to the leaders of Philistia
AMO.3.9	and to the great ones of Egypt:
AMO.3.9	“Take your seats now on the hills around Samaria,
AMO.3.9	and witness the chaos and oppression in Israel.”
AMO.3.10	“My people have forgotten how to do right,”
AMO.3.10	says the 
AMO.3.10	“Their fortresses are filled with wealth
AMO.3.10	taken by theft and violence.
AMO.3.11	Therefore,” says the Sovereign 
AMO.3.11	“an enemy is coming!
AMO.3.11	He will surround them and shatter their defenses.
AMO.3.11	Then he will plunder all their fortresses.”
AMO.3.12	This is what the 
AMO.3.12	“A shepherd who tries to rescue a sheep from a lion’s mouth
AMO.3.12	will recover only two legs or a piece of an ear.
AMO.3.12	So it will be for the Israelites in Samaria lying on luxurious beds,
AMO.3.12	and for the people of Damascus reclining on couches.
AMO.3.13	“Now listen to this, and announce it throughout all Israel,
AMO.3.14	“On the very day I punish Israel for its sins,
AMO.3.14	I will destroy the pagan altars at Bethel.
AMO.3.14	The horns of the altar will be cut off
AMO.3.14	and fall to the ground.
AMO.3.15	And I will destroy the beautiful homes of the wealthy—
AMO.3.15	their winter mansions and their summer houses, too—
AMO.3.15	all their palaces filled with ivory,”
AMO.3.15	says the 
AMO.4.1	Listen to me, you fat cows
AMO.4.1	living in Samaria,
AMO.4.1	you women who oppress the poor
AMO.4.1	and crush the needy,
AMO.4.1	and who are always calling to your husbands,
AMO.4.1	“Bring us another drink!”
AMO.4.2	The Sovereign 
AMO.4.2	“The time will come when you will be led away
AMO.4.2	with hooks in your noses.
AMO.4.2	Every last one of you will be dragged away
AMO.4.2	like a fish on a hook!
AMO.4.3	You will be led out through the ruins of the wall;
AMO.4.3	you will be thrown from your fortresses,
AMO.4.3	says the 
AMO.4.4	“Go ahead and offer sacrifices to the idols at Bethel.
AMO.4.4	Keep on disobeying at Gilgal.
AMO.4.4	Offer sacrifices each morning,
AMO.4.4	and bring your tithes every three days.
AMO.4.5	Present your bread made with yeast
AMO.4.5	as an offering of thanksgiving.
AMO.4.5	Then give your extra voluntary offerings
AMO.4.5	so you can brag about it everywhere!
AMO.4.5	This is the kind of thing you Israelites love to do,”
AMO.4.5	says the Sovereign 
AMO.4.6	“I brought hunger to every city
AMO.4.6	and famine to every town.
AMO.4.6	But still you would not return to me,”
AMO.4.6	says the 
AMO.4.7	“I kept the rain from falling
AMO.4.7	when your crops needed it the most.
AMO.4.7	I sent rain on one town
AMO.4.7	but withheld it from another.
AMO.4.7	Rain fell on one field,
AMO.4.7	while another field withered away.
AMO.4.8	People staggered from town to town looking for water,
AMO.4.8	but there was never enough.
AMO.4.8	But still you would not return to me,”
AMO.4.8	says the 
AMO.4.9	“I struck your farms and vineyards with blight and mildew.
AMO.4.9	Locusts devoured all your fig and olive trees.
AMO.4.9	But still you would not return to me,”
AMO.4.9	says the 
AMO.4.10	“I sent plagues on you
AMO.4.10	like the plagues I sent on Egypt long ago.
AMO.4.10	I killed your young men in war
AMO.4.10	and led all your horses away.
AMO.4.10	The stench of death filled the air!
AMO.4.10	But still you would not return to me,”
AMO.4.10	says the 
AMO.4.11	“I destroyed some of your cities,
AMO.4.11	as I destroyed
AMO.4.11	Those of you who survived
AMO.4.11	were like charred sticks pulled from a fire.
AMO.4.11	But still you would not return to me,”
AMO.4.11	says the 
AMO.4.12	“Therefore, I will bring upon you all the disasters I have announced.
AMO.4.12	Prepare to meet your God in judgment, you people of Israel!”
AMO.4.13	For the 
AMO.4.13	stirs up the winds, and reveals his thoughts to mankind.
AMO.4.13	He turns the light of dawn into darkness
AMO.4.13	and treads on the heights of the earth.
AMO.4.13	The 
AMO.5.1	Listen, you people of Israel! Listen to this funeral song I am singing:
AMO.5.2	“The virgin Israel has fallen,
AMO.5.2	never to rise again!
AMO.5.2	She lies abandoned on the ground,
AMO.5.2	with no one to help her up.”
AMO.5.3	The Sovereign 
AMO.5.3	“When a city sends a thousand men to battle,
AMO.5.3	only a hundred will return.
AMO.5.3	When a town sends a hundred,
AMO.5.3	only ten will come back alive.”
AMO.5.4	Now this is what the 
AMO.5.4	“Come back to me and live!
AMO.5.5	Don’t worship at the pagan altars at Bethel;
AMO.5.5	don’t go to the shrines at Gilgal or Beersheba.
AMO.5.5	For the people of Gilgal will be dragged off into exile,
AMO.5.5	and the people of Bethel will be reduced to nothing.”
AMO.5.6	Come back to the 
AMO.5.6	Otherwise, he will roar through Israel
AMO.5.6	devouring you completely.
AMO.5.6	Your gods in Bethel
AMO.5.6	won’t be able to quench the flames.
AMO.5.7	You twist justice, making it a bitter pill for the oppressed.
AMO.5.7	You treat the righteous like dirt.
AMO.5.8	It is the 
AMO.5.8	the Pleiades and Orion.
AMO.5.8	He turns darkness into morning
AMO.5.8	and day into night.
AMO.5.8	He draws up water from the oceans
AMO.5.8	and pours it down as rain on the land.
AMO.5.8	The 
AMO.5.9	With blinding speed and power he destroys the strong,
AMO.5.9	crushing all their defenses.
AMO.5.10	How you hate honest judges!
AMO.5.10	How you despise people who tell the truth!
AMO.5.11	You trample the poor,
AMO.5.11	stealing their grain through taxes and unfair rent.
AMO.5.11	Therefore, though you build beautiful stone houses,
AMO.5.11	you will never live in them.
AMO.5.11	Though you plant lush vineyards,
AMO.5.11	you will never drink wine from them.
AMO.5.12	For I know the vast number of your sins
AMO.5.12	and the depth of your rebellions.
AMO.5.12	You oppress good people by taking bribes
AMO.5.12	and deprive the poor of justice in the courts.
AMO.5.13	So those who are smart keep their mouths shut,
AMO.5.13	for it is an evil time.
AMO.5.14	Do what is good and run from evil
AMO.5.14	so that you may live!
AMO.5.14	Then the 
AMO.5.14	just as you have claimed.
AMO.5.15	Hate evil and love what is good;
AMO.5.15	turn your courts into true halls of justice.
AMO.5.15	Perhaps even yet the 
AMO.5.15	will have mercy on the remnant of his people.
AMO.5.16	Therefore, this is what the Lord, the 
AMO.5.16	“There will be crying in all the public squares
AMO.5.16	and mourning in every street.
AMO.5.16	Call for the farmers to weep with you,
AMO.5.16	and summon professional mourners to wail.
AMO.5.17	There will be wailing in every vineyard,
AMO.5.17	for I will destroy them all,”
AMO.5.17	says the 
AMO.5.18	What sorrow awaits you who say,
AMO.5.18	“If only the day of the 
AMO.5.18	You have no idea what you are wishing for.
AMO.5.18	That day will bring darkness, not light.
AMO.5.19	In that day you will be like a man who runs from a lion—
AMO.5.19	only to meet a bear.
AMO.5.19	Escaping from the bear, he leans his hand against a wall in his house—
AMO.5.19	and he’s bitten by a snake.
AMO.5.20	Yes, the day of the 
AMO.5.20	without a ray of joy or hope.
AMO.5.21	“I hate all your show and pretense—
AMO.5.21	the hypocrisy of your religious festivals and solemn assemblies.
AMO.5.22	I will not accept your burnt offerings and grain offerings.
AMO.5.22	I won’t even notice all your choice peace offerings.
AMO.5.23	Away with your noisy hymns of praise!
AMO.5.23	I will not listen to the music of your harps.
AMO.5.24	Instead, I want to see a mighty flood of justice,
AMO.5.24	an endless river of righteous living.
AMO.5.25	“Was it to me you were bringing sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness, Israel? 
AMO.5.26	No, you served your pagan gods—Sakkuth your king god and Kaiwan your star god—the images you made for yourselves. 
AMO.5.27	So I will send you into exile, to a land east of Damascus,
AMO.6.1	What sorrow awaits you who lounge in luxury in Jerusalem,
AMO.6.1	and you who feel secure in Samaria!
AMO.6.1	You are famous and popular in Israel,
AMO.6.1	and people go to you for help.
AMO.6.2	But go over to Calneh
AMO.6.2	and see what happened there.
AMO.6.2	Then go to the great city of Hamath
AMO.6.2	and down to the Philistine city of Gath.
AMO.6.2	You are no better than they were,
AMO.6.2	and look at how they were destroyed.
AMO.6.3	You push away every thought of coming disaster,
AMO.6.3	but your actions only bring the day of judgment closer.
AMO.6.4	How terrible for you who sprawl on ivory beds
AMO.6.4	and lounge on your couches,
AMO.6.4	eating the meat of tender lambs from the flock
AMO.6.4	and of choice calves fattened in the stall.
AMO.6.5	You sing trivial songs to the sound of the harp
AMO.6.5	and fancy yourselves to be great musicians like David.
AMO.6.6	You drink wine by the bowlful
AMO.6.6	and perfume yourselves with fragrant lotions.
AMO.6.6	You care nothing about the ruin of your nation.
AMO.6.7	Therefore, you will be the first to be led away as captives.
AMO.6.7	Suddenly, all your parties will end.
AMO.6.8	The Sovereign 
AMO.6.8	“I despise the arrogance of Israel,
AMO.6.8	and I hate their fortresses.
AMO.6.8	I will give this city
AMO.6.8	and everything in it to their enemies.”
AMO.6.9	(If there are ten men left in one house, they will all die. 
AMO.6.10	And when a relative who is responsible to dispose of the dead
AMO.6.11	When the 
AMO.6.11	homes both great and small will be smashed to pieces.
AMO.6.12	Can horses gallop over boulders?
AMO.6.12	Can oxen be used to plow them?
AMO.6.12	But that’s how foolish you are when you turn justice into poison
AMO.6.12	and the sweet fruit of righteousness into bitterness.
AMO.6.13	And you brag about your conquest of Lo-debar.
AMO.6.13	You boast, “Didn’t we take Karnaim
AMO.6.14	“O people of Israel, I am about to bring an enemy nation against you,”
AMO.6.14	says the 
AMO.6.14	“They will oppress you throughout your land—
AMO.6.14	from Lebo-hamath in the north
AMO.6.14	to the Arabah Valley in the south.”
AMO.7.1	The Sovereign 
AMO.7.2	In my vision the locusts ate every green plant in sight. Then I said, “O Sovereign 
AMO.7.3	So the 
AMO.7.4	Then the Sovereign 
AMO.7.5	Then I said, “O Sovereign 
AMO.7.6	Then the 
AMO.7.7	Then he showed me another vision. I saw the Lord standing beside a wall that had been built using a plumb line. He was using a plumb line to see if it was still straight. 
AMO.7.8	And the 
AMO.7.8	I answered, “A plumb line.”
AMO.7.8	And the Lord replied, “I will test my people with this plumb line. I will no longer ignore all their sins. 
AMO.7.9	The pagan shrines of your ancestors
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent a message to Jeroboam, king of Israel: “Amos is hatching a plot against you right here on your very doorstep! What he is saying is intolerable. 
AMO.7.11	He is saying, ‘Jeroboam will soon be killed, and the people of Israel will be sent away into exile.’”
AMO.7.12	Then Amaziah sent orders to Amos: “Get out of here, you prophet! Go on back to the land of Judah, and earn your living by prophesying there! 
AMO.7.13	Don’t bother us with your prophecies here in Bethel. This is the king’s sanctuary and the national place of worship!”
AMO.7.14	But Amos replied, “I’m not a professional prophet, and I was never trained to be one.
AMO.7.15	But the 
AMO.7.16	Now then, listen to this message from the 
AMO.7.16	“You say,
AMO.7.16	‘Don’t prophesy against Israel.
AMO.7.16	Stop preaching against my people.
AMO.7.17	But this is what the 
AMO.7.17	‘Your wife will become a prostitute in this city,
AMO.7.17	and your sons and daughters will be killed.
AMO.7.17	Your land will be divided up,
AMO.7.17	and you yourself will die in a foreign land.
AMO.7.17	And the people of Israel will certainly become captives in exile,
AMO.7.17	far from their homeland.’”
AMO.8.1	Then the Sovereign 
AMO.8.2	“What do you see, Amos?” he asked.
AMO.8.2	I replied, “A basket full of ripe fruit.”
AMO.8.2	Then the 
AMO.8.3	In that day the singing in the temple will turn to wailing. Dead bodies will be scattered everywhere. They will be carried out of the city in silence. I, the Sovereign 
AMO.8.4	Listen to this, you who rob the poor
AMO.8.4	and trample down the needy!
AMO.8.5	You can’t wait for the Sabbath day to be over
AMO.8.5	and the religious festivals to end
AMO.8.5	so you can get back to cheating the helpless.
AMO.8.5	You measure out grain with dishonest measures
AMO.8.5	and cheat the buyer with dishonest scales.
AMO.8.6	And you mix the grain you sell
AMO.8.6	with chaff swept from the floor.
AMO.8.6	Then you enslave poor people
AMO.8.6	for one piece of silver or a pair of sandals.
AMO.8.7	Now the 
AMO.8.7	by his own name, the Pride of Israel
AMO.8.7	“I will never forget
AMO.8.7	the wicked things you have done!
AMO.8.8	The earth will tremble for your deeds,
AMO.8.8	and everyone will mourn.
AMO.8.8	The ground will rise like the Nile River at floodtime;
AMO.8.8	it will heave up, then sink again.
AMO.8.9	“In that day,” says the Sovereign 
AMO.8.9	“I will make the sun go down at noon
AMO.8.9	and darken the earth while it is still day.
AMO.8.10	I will turn your celebrations into times of mourning
AMO.8.10	and your singing into weeping.
AMO.8.10	You will wear funeral clothes
AMO.8.10	and shave your heads to show your sorrow—
AMO.8.10	as if your only son had died.
AMO.8.10	How very bitter that day will be!
AMO.8.11	“The time is surely coming,” says the Sovereign 
AMO.8.11	“when I will send a famine on the land—
AMO.8.11	not a famine of bread or water
AMO.8.11	but of hearing the words of the 
AMO.8.12	People will stagger from sea to sea
AMO.8.12	and wander from border to border
AMO.8.12	searching for the word of the 
AMO.8.12	but they will not find it.
AMO.8.13	Beautiful girls and strong young men
AMO.8.13	will grow faint in that day,
AMO.8.13	thirsting for the 
AMO.8.14	And those who swear by the shameful idols of Samaria—
AMO.8.14	who take oaths in the name of the god of Dan
AMO.8.14	and make vows in the name of the god of Beersheba
AMO.8.14	they will all fall down,
AMO.8.14	never to rise again.”
AMO.9.1	Then I saw a vision of the Lord standing beside the altar. He said,
AMO.9.1	“Strike the tops of the Temple columns,
AMO.9.1	so that the foundation will shake.
AMO.9.1	Bring down the roof
AMO.9.1	on the heads of the people below.
AMO.9.1	I will kill with the sword those who survive.
AMO.9.1	No one will escape!
AMO.9.2	“Even if they dig down to the place of the dead,
AMO.9.2	I will reach down and pull them up.
AMO.9.2	Even if they climb up into the heavens,
AMO.9.2	I will bring them down.
AMO.9.3	Even if they hide at the very top of Mount Carmel,
AMO.9.3	I will search them out and capture them.
AMO.9.3	Even if they hide at the bottom of the ocean,
AMO.9.3	I will send the sea serpent after them to bite them.
AMO.9.4	Even if their enemies drive them into exile,
AMO.9.4	I will command the sword to kill them there.
AMO.9.4	I am determined to bring disaster upon them
AMO.9.4	and not to help them.”
AMO.9.5	The Lord, the 
AMO.9.5	touches the land and it melts,
AMO.9.5	and all its people mourn.
AMO.9.5	The ground rises like the Nile River at floodtime,
AMO.9.5	and then it sinks again.
AMO.9.6	The 
AMO.9.6	while its foundation is on the earth.
AMO.9.6	He draws up water from the oceans
AMO.9.6	and pours it down as rain on the land.
AMO.9.6	The 
AMO.9.7	“Are you Israelites more important to me
AMO.9.7	than the Ethiopians?
AMO.9.7	“I brought Israel out of Egypt,
AMO.9.7	but I also brought the Philistines from Crete
AMO.9.7	and led the Arameans out of Kir.
AMO.9.8	“I, the Sovereign 
AMO.9.8	am watching this sinful nation of Israel.
AMO.9.8	I will destroy it
AMO.9.8	from the face of the earth.
AMO.9.8	But I will never completely destroy the family of Israel,
AMO.9.8	says the 
AMO.9.9	“For I will give the command
AMO.9.9	and will shake Israel along with the other nations
AMO.9.9	as grain is shaken in a sieve,
AMO.9.9	yet not one true kernel will be lost.
AMO.9.10	But all the sinners will die by the sword—
AMO.9.10	all those who say, ‘Nothing bad will happen to us.’
AMO.9.11	“In that day I will restore the fallen house
AMO.9.11	I will repair its damaged walls.
AMO.9.11	From the ruins I will rebuild it
AMO.9.11	and restore its former glory.
AMO.9.12	And Israel will possess what is left of Edom
AMO.9.12	and all the nations I have called to be mine.
AMO.9.12	The 
AMO.9.12	and he will do these things.
AMO.9.13	“The time will come,” says the 
AMO.9.13	“when the grain and grapes will grow faster
AMO.9.13	than they can be harvested.
AMO.9.13	Then the terraced vineyards on the hills of Israel
AMO.9.13	will drip with sweet wine!
AMO.9.14	I will bring my exiled people of Israel
AMO.9.14	back from distant lands,
AMO.9.14	and they will rebuild their ruined cities
AMO.9.14	and live in them again.
AMO.9.14	They will plant vineyards and gardens;
AMO.9.14	they will eat their crops and drink their wine.
AMO.9.15	I will firmly plant them there
AMO.9.15	in their own land.
AMO.9.15	They will never again be uprooted
AMO.9.15	from the land I have given them,”
AMO.9.15	says the 
OBA.1.1	This is the vision that the Sovereign 
OBA.1.1	We have heard a message from the 
OBA.1.1	that an ambassador was sent to the nations to say,
OBA.1.1	“Get ready, everyone!
OBA.1.1	Let’s assemble our armies and attack Edom!”
OBA.1.2	The 
OBA.1.2	“I will cut you down to size among the nations;
OBA.1.2	you will be greatly despised.
OBA.1.3	You have been deceived by your own pride
OBA.1.3	because you live in a rock fortress
OBA.1.3	and make your home high in the mountains.
OBA.1.3	‘Who can ever reach us way up here?’
OBA.1.3	you ask boastfully.
OBA.1.4	But even if you soar as high as eagles
OBA.1.4	and build your nest among the stars,
OBA.1.4	I will bring you crashing down,”
OBA.1.4	says the 
OBA.1.5	“If thieves came at night and robbed you
OBA.1.5	(what a disaster awaits you!),
OBA.1.5	they would not take everything.
OBA.1.5	Those who harvest grapes
OBA.1.5	always leave a few for the poor.
OBA.1.5	But your enemies will wipe you out completely!
OBA.1.6	Every nook and cranny of Edom
OBA.1.6	will be searched and looted.
OBA.1.6	Every treasure will be found and taken.
OBA.1.7	“All your allies will turn against you.
OBA.1.7	They will help to chase you from your land.
OBA.1.7	They will promise you peace
OBA.1.7	while plotting to deceive and destroy you.
OBA.1.7	Your trusted friends will set traps for you,
OBA.1.7	and you won’t even know about it.
OBA.1.8	At that time not a single wise person
OBA.1.8	will be left in the whole land of Edom,”
OBA.1.8	says the 
OBA.1.8	“For on the mountains of Edom
OBA.1.8	I will destroy everyone who has understanding.
OBA.1.9	The mightiest warriors of Teman
OBA.1.9	will be terrified,
OBA.1.9	and everyone on the mountains of Edom
OBA.1.9	will be cut down in the slaughter.
OBA.1.10	“Because of the violence you did
OBA.1.10	to your close relatives in Israel,
OBA.1.10	you will be filled with shame
OBA.1.10	and destroyed forever.
OBA.1.11	When they were invaded,
OBA.1.11	you stood aloof, refusing to help them.
OBA.1.11	Foreign invaders carried off their wealth
OBA.1.11	and cast lots to divide up Jerusalem,
OBA.1.11	but you acted like one of Israel’s enemies.
OBA.1.12	“You should not have gloated
OBA.1.12	when they exiled your relatives to distant lands.
OBA.1.12	You should not have rejoiced
OBA.1.12	when the people of Judah suffered such misfortune.
OBA.1.12	You should not have spoken arrogantly
OBA.1.12	in that terrible time of trouble.
OBA.1.13	You should not have plundered the land of Israel
OBA.1.13	when they were suffering such calamity.
OBA.1.13	You should not have gloated over their destruction
OBA.1.13	when they were suffering such calamity.
OBA.1.13	You should not have seized their wealth
OBA.1.13	when they were suffering such calamity.
OBA.1.14	You should not have stood at the crossroads,
OBA.1.14	killing those who tried to escape.
OBA.1.14	You should not have captured the survivors
OBA.1.14	and handed them over in their terrible time of trouble.
OBA.1.15	“The day is near when I, the 
OBA.1.15	will judge all godless nations!
OBA.1.15	As you have done to Israel,
OBA.1.15	so it will be done to you.
OBA.1.15	All your evil deeds
OBA.1.15	will fall back on your own heads.
OBA.1.16	Just as you swallowed up my people
OBA.1.16	on my holy mountain,
OBA.1.16	so you and the surrounding nations
OBA.1.16	will swallow the punishment I pour out on you.
OBA.1.16	Yes, all you nations will drink and stagger
OBA.1.16	and disappear from history.
OBA.1.17	“But Jerusalem
OBA.1.17	it will be a holy place.
OBA.1.17	And the people of Israel
OBA.1.17	to reclaim their inheritance.
OBA.1.18	The people of Israel will be a raging fire,
OBA.1.18	and Edom a field of dry stubble.
OBA.1.18	The descendants of Joseph will be a flame
OBA.1.18	roaring across the field, devouring everything.
OBA.1.18	There will be no survivors in Edom.
OBA.1.18	I, the 
OBA.1.19	“Then my people living in the Negev
OBA.1.19	will occupy the mountains of Edom.
OBA.1.19	Those living in the foothills of Judah
OBA.1.19	will possess the Philistine plains
OBA.1.19	and take over the fields of Ephraim and Samaria.
OBA.1.19	And the people of Benjamin
OBA.1.19	will occupy the land of Gilead.
OBA.1.20	The exiles of Israel will return to their land
OBA.1.20	and occupy the Phoenician coast as far north as Zarephath.
OBA.1.20	The captives from Jerusalem exiled in the north
OBA.1.20	will return home and resettle the towns of the Negev.
OBA.1.21	Those who have been rescued
OBA.1.21	to rule over the mountains of Edom.
OBA.1.21	And the 
JON.1.1	The 
JON.1.2	“Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh. Announce my judgment against it because I have seen how wicked its people are.”
JON.1.3	But Jonah got up and went in the opposite direction to get away from the 
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	Fearing for their lives, the desperate sailors shouted to their gods for help and threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship.
JON.1.5	But all this time Jonah was sound asleep down in the hold. 
JON.1.6	So the captain went down after him. “How can you sleep at a time like this?” he shouted. “Get up and pray to your god! Maybe he will pay attention to us and spare our lives.”
JON.1.7	Then the crew cast lots to see which of them had offended the gods and caused the terrible storm. When they did this, the lots identified Jonah as the culprit. 
JON.1.8	“Why has this awful storm come down on us?” they demanded. “Who are you? What is your line of work? What country are you from? What is your nationality?”
JON.1.9	Jonah answered, “I am a Hebrew, and I worship the 
JON.1.10	The sailors were terrified when they heard this, for he had already told them he was running away from the 
JON.1.11	And since the storm was getting worse all the time, they asked him, “What should we do to you to stop this storm?”
JON.1.12	“Throw me into the sea,” Jonah said, “and it will become calm again. I know that this terrible storm is all my fault.”
JON.1.13	Instead, the sailors rowed even harder to get the ship to the land. But the stormy sea was too violent for them, and they couldn’t make it. 
JON.1.14	Then they cried out to the 
JON.1.15	Then the sailors picked Jonah up and threw him into the raging sea, and the storm stopped at once! 
JON.1.16	The sailors were awestruck by the 
JON.1.17	Now the 
JON.2.1	Then Jonah prayed to the 
JON.2.2	He said,
JON.2.2	“I cried out to the 
JON.2.2	and he answered me.
JON.2.2	I called to you from the land of the dead,
JON.2.2	and 
JON.2.3	You threw me into the ocean depths,
JON.2.3	and I sank down to the heart of the sea.
JON.2.3	The mighty waters engulfed me;
JON.2.3	I was buried beneath your wild and stormy waves.
JON.2.4	Then I said, ‘O 
JON.2.4	Yet I will look once more toward your holy Temple.’
JON.2.5	“I sank beneath the waves,
JON.2.5	and the waters closed over me.
JON.2.5	Seaweed wrapped itself around my head.
JON.2.6	I sank down to the very roots of the mountains.
JON.2.6	I was imprisoned in the earth,
JON.2.6	whose gates lock shut forever.
JON.2.6	But you, O 
JON.2.6	snatched me from the jaws of death!
JON.2.7	As my life was slipping away,
JON.2.7	I remembered the 
JON.2.7	And my earnest prayer went out to you
JON.2.7	in your holy Temple.
JON.2.8	Those who worship false gods
JON.2.8	turn their backs on all God’s mercies.
JON.2.9	But I will offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise,
JON.2.9	and I will fulfill all my vows.
JON.2.9	For my salvation comes from the 
JON.2.10	Then the 
JON.3.1	Then the 
JON.3.2	“Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh, and deliver the message I have given you.”
JON.3.3	This time Jonah obeyed the 
JON.3.4	On the day Jonah entered the city, he shouted to the crowds: “Forty days from now Nineveh will be destroyed!” 
JON.3.5	The people of Nineveh believed God’s message, and from the greatest to the least, they declared a fast and put on burlap to show their sorrow.
JON.3.6	When the king of Nineveh heard what Jonah was saying, he stepped down from his throne and took off his royal robes. He dressed himself in burlap and sat on a heap of ashes. 
JON.3.7	Then the king and his nobles sent this decree throughout the city:
JON.3.7	“No one, not even the animals from your herds and flocks, may eat or drink anything at all. 
JON.3.8	People and animals alike must wear garments of mourning, and everyone must pray earnestly to God. They must turn from their evil ways and stop all their violence. 
JON.3.9	Who can tell? Perhaps even yet God will change his mind and hold back his fierce anger from destroying us.”
JON.3.10	When God saw what they had done and how they had put a stop to their evil ways, he changed his mind and did not carry out the destruction he had threatened.
JON.4.1	This change of plans greatly upset Jonah, and he became very angry. 
JON.4.2	So he complained to the 
JON.4.3	Just kill me now, 
JON.4.4	The 
JON.4.5	Then Jonah went out to the east side of the city and made a shelter to sit under as he waited to see what would happen to the city. 
JON.4.6	And the 
JON.4.7	But God also arranged for a worm! The next morning at dawn the worm ate through the stem of the plant so that it withered away. 
JON.4.8	And as the sun grew hot, God arranged for a scorching east wind to blow on Jonah. The sun beat down on his head until he grew faint and wished to die. “Death is certainly better than living like this!” he exclaimed.
JON.4.9	Then God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry because the plant died?”
JON.4.9	“Yes,” Jonah retorted, “even angry enough to die!”
JON.4.10	Then the 
JON.4.11	But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people living in spiritual darkness,
MIC.1.1	The 
MIC.1.2	Attention! Let all the people of the world listen!
MIC.1.2	Let the earth and everything in it hear.
MIC.1.2	The Sovereign 
MIC.1.2	the Lord speaks from his holy Temple.
MIC.1.3	Look! The 
MIC.1.3	He leaves his throne in heaven
MIC.1.3	and tramples the heights of the earth.
MIC.1.4	The mountains melt beneath his feet
MIC.1.4	and flow into the valleys
MIC.1.4	like wax in a fire,
MIC.1.4	like water pouring down a hill.
MIC.1.5	And why is this happening?
MIC.1.5	Because of the rebellion of Israel
MIC.1.5	yes, the sins of the whole nation.
MIC.1.5	Who is to blame for Israel’s rebellion?
MIC.1.5	Samaria, its capital city!
MIC.1.5	Where is the center of idolatry in Judah?
MIC.1.5	In Jerusalem, its capital!
MIC.1.6	“So I, the 
MIC.1.6	a heap of ruins.
MIC.1.6	Her streets will be plowed up
MIC.1.6	for planting vineyards.
MIC.1.6	I will roll the stones of her walls into the valley below,
MIC.1.6	exposing her foundations.
MIC.1.7	All her carved images will be smashed.
MIC.1.7	All her sacred treasures will be burned.
MIC.1.7	These things were bought with the money
MIC.1.7	earned by her prostitution,
MIC.1.7	and they will now be carried away
MIC.1.7	to pay prostitutes elsewhere.”
MIC.1.8	Therefore, I will mourn and lament.
MIC.1.8	I will walk around barefoot and naked.
MIC.1.8	I will howl like a jackal
MIC.1.8	and moan like an owl.
MIC.1.9	For my people’s wound
MIC.1.9	is too deep to heal.
MIC.1.9	It has reached into Judah,
MIC.1.9	even to the gates of Jerusalem.
MIC.1.10	Don’t tell our enemies in Gath
MIC.1.10	don’t weep at all.
MIC.1.10	You people in Beth-leaphrah,
MIC.1.10	roll in the dust to show your despair.
MIC.1.11	You people in Shaphir,
MIC.1.11	go as captives into exile—naked and ashamed.
MIC.1.11	The people of Zaanan
MIC.1.11	dare not come outside their walls.
MIC.1.11	The people of Beth-ezel
MIC.1.11	for their house has no support.
MIC.1.12	The people of Maroth
MIC.1.12	but only bitterness awaits them
MIC.1.12	as the 
MIC.1.12	even to the gates of Jerusalem.
MIC.1.13	Harness your chariot horses and flee,
MIC.1.13	you people of Lachish.
MIC.1.13	You were the first city in Judah
MIC.1.13	to follow Israel in her rebellion,
MIC.1.13	and you led Jerusalem
MIC.1.14	Send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath
MIC.1.14	there is no hope of saving it.
MIC.1.14	The town of Aczib
MIC.1.14	has deceived the kings of Israel.
MIC.1.15	O people of Mareshah,
MIC.1.15	I will bring a conqueror to capture your town.
MIC.1.15	And the leaders
MIC.1.15	will go to Adullam.
MIC.1.16	Oh, people of Judah, shave your heads in sorrow,
MIC.1.16	for the children you love will be snatched away.
MIC.1.16	Make yourselves as bald as a vulture,
MIC.1.16	for your little ones will be exiled to distant lands.
MIC.2.1	What sorrow awaits you who lie awake at night,
MIC.2.1	thinking up evil plans.
MIC.2.1	You rise at dawn and hurry to carry them out,
MIC.2.1	simply because you have the power to do so.
MIC.2.2	When you want a piece of land,
MIC.2.2	you find a way to seize it.
MIC.2.2	When you want someone’s house,
MIC.2.2	you take it by fraud and violence.
MIC.2.2	You cheat a man of his property,
MIC.2.2	stealing his family’s inheritance.
MIC.2.3	But this is what the 
MIC.2.3	“I will reward your evil with evil;
MIC.2.3	you won’t be able to pull your neck out of the noose.
MIC.2.3	You will no longer walk around proudly,
MIC.2.3	for it will be a terrible time.”
MIC.2.4	In that day your enemies will make fun of you
MIC.2.4	by singing this song of despair about you:
MIC.2.4	“We are finished,
MIC.2.4	completely ruined!
MIC.2.4	God has confiscated our land,
MIC.2.4	taking it from us.
MIC.2.4	He has given our fields
MIC.2.4	to those who betrayed us.
MIC.2.5	Others will set your boundaries then,
MIC.2.5	and the 
MIC.2.5	in how the land is divided.
MIC.2.6	“Don’t say such things,”
MIC.2.6	the people respond.
MIC.2.6	“Don’t prophesy like that.
MIC.2.6	Such disasters will never come our way!”
MIC.2.7	Should you talk that way, O family of Israel?
MIC.2.7	Will the 
MIC.2.7	If you would do what is right,
MIC.2.7	you would find my words comforting.
MIC.2.8	Yet to this very hour
MIC.2.8	my people rise against me like an enemy!
MIC.2.8	You steal the shirts right off the backs
MIC.2.8	of those who trusted you,
MIC.2.8	making them as ragged as men
MIC.2.8	returning from battle.
MIC.2.9	You have evicted women from their pleasant homes
MIC.2.9	and forever stripped their children of all that God would give them.
MIC.2.10	Up! Begone!
MIC.2.10	This is no longer your land and home,
MIC.2.10	for you have filled it with sin
MIC.2.10	and ruined it completely.
MIC.2.11	Suppose a prophet full of lies would say to you,
MIC.2.11	“I’ll preach to you the joys of wine and alcohol!”
MIC.2.11	That’s just the kind of prophet you would like!
MIC.2.12	“Someday, O Israel, I will gather you;
MIC.2.12	I will gather the remnant who are left.
MIC.2.12	I will bring you together again like sheep in a pen,
MIC.2.12	like a flock in its pasture.
MIC.2.12	Yes, your land will again
MIC.2.12	be filled with noisy crowds!
MIC.2.13	Your leader will break out
MIC.2.13	and lead you out of exile,
MIC.2.13	out through the gates of the enemy cities,
MIC.2.13	back to your own land.
MIC.2.13	Your king will lead you;
MIC.2.13	the 
MIC.3.1	I said, “Listen, you leaders of Israel!
MIC.3.1	You are supposed to know right from wrong,
MIC.3.2	but you are the very ones
MIC.3.2	who hate good and love evil.
MIC.3.2	You skin my people alive
MIC.3.2	and tear the flesh from their bones.
MIC.3.3	Yes, you eat my people’s flesh,
MIC.3.3	strip off their skin,
MIC.3.3	and break their bones.
MIC.3.3	You chop them up
MIC.3.3	like meat for the cooking pot.
MIC.3.4	Then you beg the 
MIC.3.4	Do you really expect him to answer?
MIC.3.4	After all the evil you have done,
MIC.3.4	he won’t even look at you!”
MIC.3.5	This is what the 
MIC.3.5	“You false prophets are leading my people astray!
MIC.3.5	You promise peace for those who give you food,
MIC.3.5	but you declare war on those who refuse to feed you.
MIC.3.6	Now the night will close around you,
MIC.3.6	cutting off all your visions.
MIC.3.6	Darkness will cover you,
MIC.3.6	putting an end to your predictions.
MIC.3.6	The sun will set for you prophets,
MIC.3.6	and your day will come to an end.
MIC.3.7	Then you seers will be put to shame,
MIC.3.7	and you fortune-tellers will be disgraced.
MIC.3.7	And you will cover your faces
MIC.3.7	because there is no answer from God.”
MIC.3.8	But as for me, I am filled with power—
MIC.3.8	with the Spirit of the 
MIC.3.8	I am filled with justice and strength
MIC.3.8	to boldly declare Israel’s sin and rebellion.
MIC.3.9	Listen to me, you leaders of Israel!
MIC.3.9	You hate justice and twist all that is right.
MIC.3.10	You are building Jerusalem
MIC.3.10	on a foundation of murder and corruption.
MIC.3.11	You rulers make decisions based on bribes;
MIC.3.11	you priests teach God’s laws only for a price;
MIC.3.11	you prophets won’t prophesy unless you are paid.
MIC.3.11	Yet all of you claim to depend on the 
MIC.3.11	“No harm can come to us,” you say,
MIC.3.11	“for the 
MIC.3.12	Because of you, Mount Zion will be plowed like an open field;
MIC.3.12	Jerusalem will be reduced to ruins!
MIC.3.12	A thicket will grow on the heights
MIC.3.12	where the Temple now stands.
MIC.4.1	In the last days, the mountain of the 
MIC.4.1	will be the highest of all—
MIC.4.1	the most important place on earth.
MIC.4.1	It will be raised above the other hills,
MIC.4.1	and people from all over the world will stream there to worship.
MIC.4.2	People from many nations will come and say,
MIC.4.2	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the 
MIC.4.2	to the house of Jacob’s God.
MIC.4.2	There he will teach us his ways,
MIC.4.2	and we will walk in his paths.”
MIC.4.2	For the 
MIC.4.2	his word will go out from Jerusalem.
MIC.4.3	The 
MIC.4.3	and will settle disputes between strong nations far away.
MIC.4.3	They will hammer their swords into plowshares
MIC.4.3	and their spears into pruning hooks.
MIC.4.3	Nation will no longer fight against nation,
MIC.4.3	nor train for war anymore.
MIC.4.4	Everyone will live in peace and prosperity,
MIC.4.4	enjoying their own grapevines and fig trees,
MIC.4.4	for there will be nothing to fear.
MIC.4.4	The 
MIC.4.4	has made this promise!
MIC.4.5	Though the nations around us follow their idols,
MIC.4.5	we will follow the 
MIC.4.6	“In that coming day,” says the 
MIC.4.6	“I will gather together those who are lame,
MIC.4.6	those who have been exiles,
MIC.4.6	and those whom I have filled with grief.
MIC.4.7	Those who are weak will survive as a remnant;
MIC.4.7	those who were exiles will become a strong nation.
MIC.4.7	Then I, the 
MIC.4.7	as their king forever.”
MIC.4.8	As for you, Jerusalem,
MIC.4.8	the citadel of God’s people,
MIC.4.8	your royal might and power
MIC.4.8	will come back to you again.
MIC.4.8	The kingship will be restored
MIC.4.8	to my precious Jerusalem.
MIC.4.9	But why are you now screaming in terror?
MIC.4.9	Have you no king to lead you?
MIC.4.9	Have your wise people all died?
MIC.4.9	Pain has gripped you like a woman in childbirth.
MIC.4.10	Writhe and groan like a woman in labor,
MIC.4.10	you people of Jerusalem,
MIC.4.10	for now you must leave this city
MIC.4.10	to live in the open country.
MIC.4.10	You will soon be sent in exile
MIC.4.10	to distant Babylon.
MIC.4.10	But the 
MIC.4.10	he will redeem you from the grip of your enemies.
MIC.4.11	Now many nations have gathered against you.
MIC.4.11	“Let her be desecrated,” they say.
MIC.4.11	“Let us see the destruction of Jerusalem.
MIC.4.12	But they do not know the 
MIC.4.12	or understand his plan.
MIC.4.12	These nations don’t know
MIC.4.12	that he is gathering them together
MIC.4.12	to be beaten and trampled
MIC.4.12	like sheaves of grain on a threshing floor.
MIC.4.13	“Rise up and crush the nations, O Jerusalem!”
MIC.4.13	says the 
MIC.4.13	“For I will give you iron horns and bronze hooves,
MIC.4.13	so you can trample many nations to pieces.
MIC.4.13	You will present their stolen riches to the 
MIC.4.13	their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.”
MIC.5.1	Mobilize! Marshal your troops!
MIC.5.1	The enemy is laying siege to Jerusalem.
MIC.5.1	They will strike Israel’s leader
MIC.5.1	in the face with a rod.
MIC.5.2	But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,
MIC.5.2	are only a small village among all the people of Judah.
MIC.5.2	Yet a ruler of Israel,
MIC.5.2	whose origins are in the distant past,
MIC.5.2	will come from you on my behalf.
MIC.5.3	The people of Israel will be abandoned to their enemies
MIC.5.3	until the woman in labor gives birth.
MIC.5.3	Then at last his fellow countrymen
MIC.5.3	will return from exile to their own land.
MIC.5.4	And he will stand to lead his flock with the 
MIC.5.4	in the majesty of the name of the 
MIC.5.4	Then his people will live there undisturbed,
MIC.5.4	for he will be highly honored around the world.
MIC.5.5	And he will be the source of peace.
MIC.5.5	When the Assyrians invade our land
MIC.5.5	and break through our defenses,
MIC.5.5	we will appoint seven rulers to watch over us,
MIC.5.5	eight princes to lead us.
MIC.5.6	They will rule Assyria with drawn swords
MIC.5.6	and enter the gates of the land of Nimrod.
MIC.5.6	He will rescue us from the Assyrians
MIC.5.6	when they pour over the borders to invade our land.
MIC.5.7	Then the remnant left in Israel
MIC.5.7	will take their place among the nations.
MIC.5.7	They will be like dew sent by the 
MIC.5.7	or like rain falling on the grass,
MIC.5.7	which no one can hold back
MIC.5.7	and no one can restrain.
MIC.5.8	The remnant left in Israel
MIC.5.8	will take their place among the nations.
MIC.5.8	They will be like a lion among the animals of the forest,
MIC.5.8	like a strong young lion among flocks of sheep and goats,
MIC.5.8	pouncing and tearing as they go
MIC.5.8	with no rescuer in sight.
MIC.5.9	The people of Israel will stand up to their foes,
MIC.5.9	and all their enemies will be wiped out.
MIC.5.10	“In that day,” says the 
MIC.5.10	“I will slaughter your horses
MIC.5.10	and destroy your chariots.
MIC.5.11	I will tear down your walls
MIC.5.11	and demolish your defenses.
MIC.5.12	I will put an end to all witchcraft,
MIC.5.12	and there will be no more fortune-tellers.
MIC.5.13	I will destroy all your idols and sacred pillars,
MIC.5.13	so you will never again worship the work of your own hands.
MIC.5.14	I will abolish your idol shrines with their Asherah poles
MIC.5.14	and destroy your pagan cities.
MIC.5.15	I will pour out my vengeance
MIC.5.15	on all the nations that refuse to obey me.”
MIC.6.1	Listen to what the 
MIC.6.1	“Stand up and state your case against me.
MIC.6.1	Let the mountains and hills be called to witness your complaints.
MIC.6.2	And now, O mountains,
MIC.6.2	listen to the 
MIC.6.2	He has a case against his people.
MIC.6.2	He will bring charges against Israel.
MIC.6.3	“O my people, what have I done to you?
MIC.6.3	What have I done to make you tired of me?
MIC.6.3	Answer me!
MIC.6.4	For I brought you out of Egypt
MIC.6.4	and redeemed you from slavery.
MIC.6.4	I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to help you.
MIC.6.5	Don’t you remember, my people,
MIC.6.5	how King Balak of Moab tried to have you cursed
MIC.6.5	and how Balaam son of Beor blessed you instead?
MIC.6.5	And remember your journey from Acacia Grove
MIC.6.5	when I, the 
MIC.6.5	to teach you about my faithfulness.”
MIC.6.6	What can we bring to the 
MIC.6.6	Should we bring him burnt offerings?
MIC.6.6	Should we bow before God Most High
MIC.6.6	with offerings of yearling calves?
MIC.6.7	Should we offer him thousands of rams
MIC.6.7	and ten thousand rivers of olive oil?
MIC.6.7	Should we sacrifice our firstborn children
MIC.6.7	to pay for our sins?
MIC.6.8	No, O people, the 
MIC.6.8	and this is what he requires of you:
MIC.6.8	to do what is right, to love mercy,
MIC.6.8	and to walk humbly with your God.
MIC.6.9	Fear the 
MIC.6.9	His voice calls to everyone in Jerusalem:
MIC.6.9	“The armies of destruction are coming;
MIC.6.9	the 
MIC.6.10	What shall I say about the homes of the wicked
MIC.6.10	filled with treasures gained by cheating?
MIC.6.10	What about the disgusting practice
MIC.6.10	of measuring out grain with dishonest measures?
MIC.6.11	How can I tolerate your merchants
MIC.6.11	who use dishonest scales and weights?
MIC.6.12	The rich among you have become wealthy
MIC.6.12	through extortion and violence.
MIC.6.12	Your citizens are so used to lying
MIC.6.12	that their tongues can no longer tell the truth.
MIC.6.13	“Therefore, I will wound you!
MIC.6.13	I will bring you to ruin for all your sins.
MIC.6.14	You will eat but never have enough.
MIC.6.14	Your hunger pangs and emptiness will remain.
MIC.6.14	And though you try to save your money,
MIC.6.14	it will come to nothing in the end.
MIC.6.14	You will save a little,
MIC.6.14	but I will give it to those who conquer you.
MIC.6.15	You will plant crops
MIC.6.15	but not harvest them.
MIC.6.15	You will press your olives
MIC.6.15	but not get enough oil to anoint yourselves.
MIC.6.15	You will trample the grapes
MIC.6.15	but get no juice to make your wine.
MIC.6.16	You keep only the laws of evil King Omri;
MIC.6.16	you follow only the example of wicked King Ahab!
MIC.6.16	Therefore, I will make an example of you,
MIC.6.16	bringing you to complete ruin.
MIC.6.16	You will be treated with contempt,
MIC.6.16	mocked by all who see you.”
MIC.7.1	How miserable I am!
MIC.7.1	I feel like the fruit picker after the harvest
MIC.7.1	who can find nothing to eat.
MIC.7.1	Not a cluster of grapes or a single early fig
MIC.7.1	can be found to satisfy my hunger.
MIC.7.2	The godly people have all disappeared;
MIC.7.2	not one honest person is left on the earth.
MIC.7.2	They are all murderers,
MIC.7.2	setting traps even for their own brothers.
MIC.7.3	Both their hands are equally skilled at doing evil!
MIC.7.3	Officials and judges alike demand bribes.
MIC.7.3	The people with influence get what they want,
MIC.7.3	and together they scheme to twist justice.
MIC.7.4	Even the best of them is like a brier;
MIC.7.4	the most honest is as dangerous as a hedge of thorns.
MIC.7.4	But your judgment day is coming swiftly now.
MIC.7.4	Your time of punishment is here, a time of confusion.
MIC.7.5	Don’t trust anyone—
MIC.7.5	not your best friend or even your wife!
MIC.7.6	For the son despises his father.
MIC.7.6	The daughter defies her mother.
MIC.7.6	The daughter-in-law defies her mother-in-law.
MIC.7.6	Your enemies are right in your own household!
MIC.7.7	As for me, I look to the 
MIC.7.7	I wait confidently for God to save me,
MIC.7.7	and my God will certainly hear me.
MIC.7.8	Do not gloat over me, my enemies!
MIC.7.8	For though I fall, I will rise again.
MIC.7.8	Though I sit in darkness,
MIC.7.8	the 
MIC.7.9	I will be patient as the 
MIC.7.9	for I have sinned against him.
MIC.7.9	But after that, he will take up my case
MIC.7.9	and give me justice for all I have suffered from my enemies.
MIC.7.9	The 
MIC.7.9	and I will see his righteousness.
MIC.7.10	Then my enemies will see that the 
MIC.7.10	They will be ashamed that they taunted me, saying,
MIC.7.10	“So where is the 
MIC.7.10	that God of yours?”
MIC.7.10	With my own eyes I will see their downfall;
MIC.7.10	they will be trampled like mud in the streets.
MIC.7.11	In that day, Israel, your cities will be rebuilt,
MIC.7.11	and your borders will be extended.
MIC.7.12	People from many lands will come and honor you—
MIC.7.12	from Assyria all the way to the towns of Egypt,
MIC.7.12	from Egypt all the way to the Euphrates River,
MIC.7.12	and from distant seas and mountains.
MIC.7.13	But the land
MIC.7.13	because of the wickedness of those who live there.
MIC.7.14	O 
MIC.7.14	lead your flock, your special possession.
MIC.7.14	Though they live alone in a thicket
MIC.7.14	on the heights of Mount Carmel,
MIC.7.14	let them graze in the fertile pastures of Bashan and Gilead
MIC.7.14	as they did long ago.
MIC.7.15	“Yes,” says the 
MIC.7.15	“I will do mighty miracles for you,
MIC.7.15	like those I did when I rescued you
MIC.7.15	from slavery in Egypt.”
MIC.7.16	All the nations of the world will stand amazed
MIC.7.16	at what the 
MIC.7.16	They will be embarrassed
MIC.7.16	at their feeble power.
MIC.7.16	They will cover their mouths in silent awe,
MIC.7.16	deaf to everything around them.
MIC.7.17	Like snakes crawling from their holes,
MIC.7.17	they will come out to meet the 
MIC.7.17	They will fear him greatly,
MIC.7.17	trembling in terror at his presence.
MIC.7.18	Where is another God like you,
MIC.7.18	who pardons the guilt of the remnant,
MIC.7.18	overlooking the sins of his special people?
MIC.7.18	You will not stay angry with your people forever,
MIC.7.18	because you delight in showing unfailing love.
MIC.7.19	Once again you will have compassion on us.
MIC.7.19	You will trample our sins under your feet
MIC.7.19	and throw them into the depths of the ocean!
MIC.7.20	You will show us your faithfulness and unfailing love
MIC.7.20	as you promised to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob long ago.
NAM.1.1	This message concerning Nineveh came as a vision to Nahum, who lived in Elkosh.
NAM.1.2	The 
NAM.1.2	filled with vengeance and rage.
NAM.1.2	He takes revenge on all who oppose him
NAM.1.2	and continues to rage against his enemies!
NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.3	and he never lets the guilty go unpunished.
NAM.1.3	He displays his power in the whirlwind and the storm.
NAM.1.3	The billowing clouds are the dust beneath his feet.
NAM.1.4	At his command the oceans dry up,
NAM.1.4	and the rivers disappear.
NAM.1.4	The lush pastures of Bashan and Carmel fade,
NAM.1.4	and the green forests of Lebanon wither.
NAM.1.5	In his presence the mountains quake,
NAM.1.5	and the hills melt away;
NAM.1.5	the earth trembles,
NAM.1.5	and its people are destroyed.
NAM.1.6	Who can stand before his fierce anger?
NAM.1.6	Who can survive his burning fury?
NAM.1.6	His rage blazes forth like fire,
NAM.1.6	and the mountains crumble to dust in his presence.
NAM.1.7	The 
NAM.1.7	a strong refuge when trouble comes.
NAM.1.7	He is close to those who trust in him.
NAM.1.8	But he will sweep away his enemies
NAM.1.8	in an overwhelming flood.
NAM.1.8	He will pursue his foes
NAM.1.8	into the darkness of night.
NAM.1.9	Why are you scheming against the 
NAM.1.9	He will destroy you with one blow;
NAM.1.9	he won’t need to strike twice!
NAM.1.10	His enemies, tangled like thornbushes
NAM.1.10	and staggering like drunks,
NAM.1.10	will be burned up like dry stubble in a field.
NAM.1.11	Who is this wicked counselor of yours
NAM.1.11	who plots evil against the 
NAM.1.12	This is what the 
NAM.1.12	“Though the Assyrians have many allies,
NAM.1.12	they will be destroyed and disappear.
NAM.1.12	O my people, I have punished you before,
NAM.1.12	but I will not punish you again.
NAM.1.13	Now I will break the yoke of bondage from your neck
NAM.1.13	and tear off the chains of Assyrian oppression.”
NAM.1.14	And this is what the 
NAM.1.14	“You will have no more children to carry on your name.
NAM.1.14	I will destroy all the idols in the temples of your gods.
NAM.1.14	I am preparing a grave for you
NAM.1.14	because you are despicable!”
NAM.1.15	Look! A messenger is coming over the mountains with good news!
NAM.1.15	He is bringing a message of peace.
NAM.1.15	Celebrate your festivals, O people of Judah,
NAM.1.15	and fulfill all your vows,
NAM.1.15	for your wicked enemies will never invade your land again.
NAM.1.15	They will be completely destroyed!
NAM.2.1	Your enemy is coming to crush you, Nineveh.
NAM.2.1	Man the ramparts! Watch the roads!
NAM.2.1	Prepare your defenses! Call out your forces!
NAM.2.2	Even though the destroyer has destroyed Judah,
NAM.2.2	the 
NAM.2.2	Israel’s vine has been stripped of branches,
NAM.2.2	but he will restore its splendor.
NAM.2.3	Shields flash red in the sunlight!
NAM.2.3	See the scarlet uniforms of the valiant troops!
NAM.2.3	Watch as their glittering chariots move into position,
NAM.2.3	with a forest of spears waving above them.
NAM.2.4	The chariots race recklessly along the streets
NAM.2.4	and rush wildly through the squares.
NAM.2.4	They flash like firelight
NAM.2.4	and move as swiftly as lightning.
NAM.2.5	The king shouts to his officers;
NAM.2.5	they stumble in their haste,
NAM.2.5	rushing to the walls to set up their defenses.
NAM.2.6	The river gates have been torn open!
NAM.2.6	The palace is about to collapse!
NAM.2.7	Nineveh’s exile has been decreed,
NAM.2.7	and all the servant girls mourn its capture.
NAM.2.7	They moan like doves
NAM.2.7	and beat their breasts in sorrow.
NAM.2.8	Nineveh is like a leaking water reservoir!
NAM.2.8	The people are slipping away.
NAM.2.8	“Stop, stop!” someone shouts,
NAM.2.8	but no one even looks back.
NAM.2.9	Loot the silver!
NAM.2.9	Plunder the gold!
NAM.2.9	There’s no end to Nineveh’s treasures—
NAM.2.9	its vast, uncounted wealth.
NAM.2.10	Soon the city is plundered, empty, and ruined.
NAM.2.10	Hearts melt and knees shake.
NAM.2.10	The people stand aghast,
NAM.2.10	their faces pale and trembling.
NAM.2.11	Where now is that great Nineveh,
NAM.2.11	that den filled with young lions?
NAM.2.11	It was a place where people—like lions and their cubs—
NAM.2.11	walked freely and without fear.
NAM.2.12	The lion tore up meat for his cubs
NAM.2.12	and strangled prey for his mate.
NAM.2.12	He filled his den with prey,
NAM.2.12	his caverns with his plunder.
NAM.2.13	“I am your enemy!”
NAM.2.13	says the 
NAM.2.13	“Your chariots will soon go up in smoke.
NAM.2.13	Your young men
NAM.2.13	Never again will you plunder conquered nations.
NAM.2.13	The voices of your proud messengers will be heard no more.”
NAM.3.1	What sorrow awaits Nineveh,
NAM.3.1	the city of murder and lies!
NAM.3.1	She is crammed with wealth
NAM.3.1	and is never without victims.
NAM.3.2	Hear the crack of whips,
NAM.3.2	the rumble of wheels!
NAM.3.2	Horses’ hooves pound,
NAM.3.2	and chariots clatter wildly.
NAM.3.3	See the flashing swords and glittering spears
NAM.3.3	as the charioteers charge past!
NAM.3.3	There are countless casualties,
NAM.3.3	heaps of bodies—
NAM.3.3	so many bodies that
NAM.3.3	people stumble over them.
NAM.3.4	All this because Nineveh,
NAM.3.4	the beautiful and faithless city,
NAM.3.4	mistress of deadly charms,
NAM.3.4	enticed the nations with her beauty.
NAM.3.4	She taught them all her magic,
NAM.3.4	enchanting people everywhere.
NAM.3.5	“I am your enemy!”
NAM.3.5	says the 
NAM.3.5	“And now I will lift your skirts
NAM.3.5	and show all the earth your nakedness and shame.
NAM.3.6	I will cover you with filth
NAM.3.6	and show the world how vile you really are.
NAM.3.7	All who see you will shrink back and say,
NAM.3.7	‘Nineveh lies in ruins.
NAM.3.7	Where are the mourners?’
NAM.3.7	Does anyone regret your destruction?”
NAM.3.8	Are you any better than the city of Thebes,
NAM.3.8	situated on the Nile River, surrounded by water?
NAM.3.8	She was protected by the river on all sides,
NAM.3.8	walled in by water.
NAM.3.9	Ethiopia
NAM.3.9	gave unlimited assistance.
NAM.3.9	The nations of Put and Libya
NAM.3.9	were among her allies.
NAM.3.10	Yet Thebes fell,
NAM.3.10	and her people were led away as captives.
NAM.3.10	Her babies were dashed to death
NAM.3.10	against the stones of the streets.
NAM.3.10	Soldiers threw dice
NAM.3.10	All their leaders were bound in chains.
NAM.3.11	And you, Nineveh, will also stagger like a drunkard.
NAM.3.11	You will hide for fear of the attacking enemy.
NAM.3.12	All your fortresses will fall.
NAM.3.12	They will be devoured like the ripe figs
NAM.3.12	that fall into the mouths
NAM.3.12	of those who shake the trees.
NAM.3.13	Your troops will be as weak
NAM.3.13	and helpless as women.
NAM.3.13	The gates of your land will be opened wide to the enemy
NAM.3.13	and set on fire and burned.
NAM.3.14	Get ready for the siege!
NAM.3.14	Store up water!
NAM.3.14	Strengthen the defenses!
NAM.3.14	Go into the pits to trample clay,
NAM.3.14	and pack it into molds,
NAM.3.14	making bricks to repair the walls.
NAM.3.15	But the fire will devour you;
NAM.3.15	the sword will cut you down.
NAM.3.15	The enemy will consume you like locusts,
NAM.3.15	devouring everything they see.
NAM.3.15	There will be no escape,
NAM.3.15	even if you multiply like swarming locusts.
NAM.3.16	Your merchants have multiplied
NAM.3.16	until they outnumber the stars.
NAM.3.16	But like a swarm of locusts,
NAM.3.16	they strip the land and fly away.
NAM.3.17	Your guards
NAM.3.17	that crowd together in the hedges on a cold day.
NAM.3.17	But like locusts that fly away when the sun comes up,
NAM.3.17	all of them will fly away and disappear.
NAM.3.18	Your shepherds are asleep, O Assyrian king;
NAM.3.18	your princes lie dead in the dust.
NAM.3.18	Your people are scattered across the mountains
NAM.3.18	with no one to gather them together.
NAM.3.19	There is no healing for your wound;
NAM.3.19	your injury is fatal.
NAM.3.19	All who hear of your destruction
NAM.3.19	will clap their hands for joy.
NAM.3.19	Where can anyone be found
NAM.3.19	who has not suffered from your continual cruelty?
HAB.1.1	This is the message that the prophet Habakkuk received in a vision.
HAB.1.2	How long, O 
HAB.1.2	But you do not listen!
HAB.1.2	“Violence is everywhere!” I cry,
HAB.1.2	but you do not come to save.
HAB.1.3	Must I forever see these evil deeds?
HAB.1.3	Why must I watch all this misery?
HAB.1.3	Wherever I look,
HAB.1.3	I see destruction and violence.
HAB.1.3	I am surrounded by people
HAB.1.3	who love to argue and fight.
HAB.1.4	The law has become paralyzed,
HAB.1.4	and there is no justice in the courts.
HAB.1.4	The wicked far outnumber the righteous,
HAB.1.4	so that justice has become perverted.
HAB.1.5	The 
HAB.1.5	“Look around at the nations;
HAB.1.5	look and be amazed!
HAB.1.5	For I am doing something in your own day,
HAB.1.5	something you wouldn’t believe
HAB.1.5	even if someone told you about it.
HAB.1.6	I am raising up the Babylonians,
HAB.1.6	a cruel and violent people.
HAB.1.6	They will march across the world
HAB.1.6	and conquer other lands.
HAB.1.7	They are notorious for their cruelty
HAB.1.7	and do whatever they like.
HAB.1.8	Their horses are swifter than cheetahs
HAB.1.8	and fiercer than wolves at dusk.
HAB.1.8	Their charioteers charge from far away.
HAB.1.8	Like eagles, they swoop down to devour their prey.
HAB.1.9	“On they come, all bent on violence.
HAB.1.9	Their hordes advance like a desert wind,
HAB.1.9	sweeping captives ahead of them like sand.
HAB.1.10	They scoff at kings and princes
HAB.1.10	and scorn all their fortresses.
HAB.1.10	They simply pile ramps of earth
HAB.1.10	against their walls and capture them!
HAB.1.11	They sweep past like the wind
HAB.1.11	and are gone.
HAB.1.11	But they are deeply guilty,
HAB.1.11	for their own strength is their god.”
HAB.1.12	O 
HAB.1.12	surely you do not plan to wipe us out?
HAB.1.12	O 
HAB.1.12	to punish us for our many sins.
HAB.1.13	But you are pure and cannot stand the sight of evil.
HAB.1.13	Will you wink at their treachery?
HAB.1.13	Should you be silent while the wicked
HAB.1.13	swallow up people more righteous than they?
HAB.1.14	Are we only fish to be caught and killed?
HAB.1.14	Are we only sea creatures that have no leader?
HAB.1.15	Must we be strung up on their hooks
HAB.1.15	and caught in their nets while they rejoice and celebrate?
HAB.1.16	Then they will worship their nets
HAB.1.16	and burn incense in front of them.
HAB.1.16	“These nets are the gods who have made us rich!”
HAB.1.16	they will claim.
HAB.1.17	Will you let them get away with this forever?
HAB.1.17	Will they succeed forever in their heartless conquests?
HAB.2.1	I will climb up to my watchtower
HAB.2.1	and stand at my guardpost.
HAB.2.1	There I will wait to see what the 
HAB.2.1	and how he
HAB.2.2	Then the 
HAB.2.2	“Write my answer plainly on tablets,
HAB.2.2	so that a runner can carry the correct message to others.
HAB.2.3	This vision is for a future time.
HAB.2.3	It describes the end, and it will be fulfilled.
HAB.2.3	If it seems slow in coming, wait patiently,
HAB.2.3	for it will surely take place.
HAB.2.3	It will not be delayed.
HAB.2.4	“Look at the proud!
HAB.2.4	They trust in themselves, and their lives are crooked.
HAB.2.4	But the righteous will live by their faithfulness to God.
HAB.2.5	Wealth
HAB.2.5	and the arrogant are never at rest.
HAB.2.5	They open their mouths as wide as the grave,
HAB.2.5	and like death, they are never satisfied.
HAB.2.5	In their greed they have gathered up many nations
HAB.2.5	and swallowed many peoples.
HAB.2.6	“But soon their captives will taunt them.
HAB.2.6	They will mock them, saying,
HAB.2.6	‘What sorrow awaits you thieves!
HAB.2.6	Now you will get what you deserve!
HAB.2.6	You’ve become rich by extortion,
HAB.2.6	but how much longer can this go on?’
HAB.2.7	Suddenly, your debtors will take action.
HAB.2.7	They will turn on you and take all you have,
HAB.2.7	while you stand trembling and helpless.
HAB.2.8	Because you have plundered many nations,
HAB.2.8	now all the survivors will plunder you.
HAB.2.8	You committed murder throughout the countryside
HAB.2.8	and filled the towns with violence.
HAB.2.9	“What sorrow awaits you who build big houses
HAB.2.9	with money gained dishonestly!
HAB.2.9	You believe your wealth will buy security,
HAB.2.9	putting your family’s nest beyond the reach of danger.
HAB.2.10	But by the murders you committed,
HAB.2.10	you have shamed your name and forfeited your lives.
HAB.2.11	The very stones in the walls cry out against you,
HAB.2.11	and the beams in the ceilings echo the complaint.
HAB.2.12	“What sorrow awaits you who build cities
HAB.2.12	with money gained through murder and corruption!
HAB.2.13	Has not the 
HAB.2.13	that the wealth of nations will turn to ashes?
HAB.2.13	They work so hard,
HAB.2.13	but all in vain!
HAB.2.14	For as the waters fill the sea,
HAB.2.14	the earth will be filled with an awareness
HAB.2.14	of the glory of the 
HAB.2.15	“What sorrow awaits you who make your neighbors drunk!
HAB.2.15	You force your cup on them
HAB.2.15	so you can gloat over their shameful nakedness.
HAB.2.16	But soon it will be your turn to be disgraced.
HAB.2.16	Come, drink and be exposed!
HAB.2.16	Drink from the cup of the 
HAB.2.16	and all your glory will be turned to shame.
HAB.2.17	You cut down the forests of Lebanon.
HAB.2.17	Now you will be cut down.
HAB.2.17	You destroyed the wild animals,
HAB.2.17	so now their terror will be yours.
HAB.2.17	You committed murder throughout the countryside
HAB.2.17	and filled the towns with violence.
HAB.2.18	“What good is an idol carved by man,
HAB.2.18	or a cast image that deceives you?
HAB.2.18	How foolish to trust in your own creation—
HAB.2.18	a god that can’t even talk!
HAB.2.19	What sorrow awaits you who say to wooden idols,
HAB.2.19	‘Wake up and save us!’
HAB.2.19	To speechless stone images you say,
HAB.2.19	‘Rise up and teach us!’
HAB.2.19	Can an idol tell you what to do?
HAB.2.19	They may be overlaid with gold and silver,
HAB.2.19	but they are lifeless inside.
HAB.2.20	But the 
HAB.2.20	Let all the earth be silent before him.”
HAB.3.1	This prayer was sung by the prophet Habakkuk
HAB.3.2	I have heard all about you, 
HAB.3.2	I am filled with awe by your amazing works.
HAB.3.2	In this time of our deep need,
HAB.3.2	help us again as you did in years gone by.
HAB.3.2	And in your anger,
HAB.3.2	remember your mercy.
HAB.3.3	I see God moving across the deserts from Edom,
HAB.3.3	the Holy One coming from Mount Paran.
HAB.3.3	His brilliant splendor fills the heavens,
HAB.3.3	and the earth is filled with his praise.
HAB.3.4	His coming is as brilliant as the sunrise.
HAB.3.4	Rays of light flash from his hands,
HAB.3.4	where his awesome power is hidden.
HAB.3.5	Pestilence marches before him;
HAB.3.5	plague follows close behind.
HAB.3.6	When he stops, the earth shakes.
HAB.3.6	When he looks, the nations tremble.
HAB.3.6	He shatters the everlasting mountains
HAB.3.6	and levels the eternal hills.
HAB.3.6	He is the Eternal One!
HAB.3.7	I see the people of Cushan in distress,
HAB.3.7	and the nation of Midian trembling in terror.
HAB.3.8	Was it in anger, 
HAB.3.8	and parted the sea?
HAB.3.8	Were you displeased with them?
HAB.3.8	No, you were sending your chariots of salvation!
HAB.3.9	You brandished your bow
HAB.3.9	and your quiver of arrows.
HAB.3.9	You split open the earth with flowing rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains watched and trembled.
HAB.3.10	Onward swept the raging waters.
HAB.3.10	The mighty deep cried out,
HAB.3.10	lifting its hands in submission.
HAB.3.11	The sun and moon stood still in the sky
HAB.3.11	as your brilliant arrows flew
HAB.3.11	and your glittering spear flashed.
HAB.3.12	You marched across the land in anger
HAB.3.12	and trampled the nations in your fury.
HAB.3.13	You went out to rescue your chosen people,
HAB.3.13	to save your anointed ones.
HAB.3.13	You crushed the heads of the wicked
HAB.3.13	and stripped their bones from head to toe.
HAB.3.14	With his own weapons,
HAB.3.14	you destroyed the chief of those
HAB.3.14	who rushed out like a whirlwind,
HAB.3.14	thinking Israel would be easy prey.
HAB.3.15	You trampled the sea with your horses,
HAB.3.15	and the mighty waters piled high.
HAB.3.16	I trembled inside when I heard this;
HAB.3.16	my lips quivered with fear.
HAB.3.16	My legs gave way beneath me,
HAB.3.16	and I shook in terror.
HAB.3.16	I will wait quietly for the coming day
HAB.3.16	when disaster will strike the people who invade us.
HAB.3.17	Even though the fig trees have no blossoms,
HAB.3.17	and there are no grapes on the vines;
HAB.3.17	even though the olive crop fails,
HAB.3.17	and the fields lie empty and barren;
HAB.3.17	even though the flocks die in the fields,
HAB.3.17	and the cattle barns are empty,
HAB.3.18	yet I will rejoice in the 
HAB.3.18	I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!
HAB.3.19	The Sovereign 
HAB.3.19	He makes me as surefooted as a deer,
HAB.3.19	able to tread upon the heights.

ZEP.1.1	The 
ZEP.1.2	“I will sweep away everything
ZEP.1.2	from the face of the earth,” says the 
ZEP.1.3	“I will sweep away people and animals alike.
ZEP.1.3	I will sweep away the birds of the sky and the fish in the sea.
ZEP.1.3	I will reduce the wicked to heaps of rubble,
ZEP.1.3	and I will wipe humanity from the face of the earth,” says the 
ZEP.1.4	“I will crush Judah and Jerusalem with my fist
ZEP.1.4	and destroy every last trace of their Baal worship.
ZEP.1.4	I will put an end to all the idolatrous priests,
ZEP.1.4	so that even the memory of them will disappear.
ZEP.1.5	For they go up to their roofs
ZEP.1.5	and bow down to the sun, moon, and stars.
ZEP.1.5	They claim to follow the 
ZEP.1.5	but then they worship Molech,
ZEP.1.6	And I will destroy those who used to worship me
ZEP.1.6	but now no longer do.
ZEP.1.6	They no longer ask for the 
ZEP.1.6	or seek my blessings.”
ZEP.1.7	Stand in silence in the presence of the Sovereign 
ZEP.1.7	for the awesome day of the 
ZEP.1.7	The 
ZEP.1.7	and has chosen their executioners.
ZEP.1.8	“On that day of judgment,”
ZEP.1.8	says the 
ZEP.1.8	“I will punish the leaders and princes of Judah
ZEP.1.8	and all those following pagan customs.
ZEP.1.9	Yes, I will punish those who participate in pagan worship ceremonies,
ZEP.1.9	and those who fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit.
ZEP.1.10	“On that day,” says the 
ZEP.1.10	“a cry of alarm will come from the Fish Gate
ZEP.1.10	and echo throughout the New Quarter of the city.
ZEP.1.10	And a great crash will sound from the hills.
ZEP.1.11	Wail in sorrow, all you who live in the market area,
ZEP.1.11	for all the merchants and traders will be destroyed.
ZEP.1.12	“I will search with lanterns in Jerusalem’s darkest corners
ZEP.1.12	to punish those who sit complacent in their sins.
ZEP.1.12	They think the 
ZEP.1.12	either good or bad.
ZEP.1.13	So their property will be plundered,
ZEP.1.13	their homes will be ransacked.
ZEP.1.13	They will build new homes
ZEP.1.13	but never live in them.
ZEP.1.13	They will plant vineyards
ZEP.1.13	but never drink wine from them.
ZEP.1.14	“That terrible day of the 
ZEP.1.14	Swiftly it comes—
ZEP.1.14	a day of bitter tears,
ZEP.1.14	a day when even strong men will cry out.
ZEP.1.15	It will be a day when the 
ZEP.1.15	a day of terrible distress and anguish,
ZEP.1.15	a day of ruin and desolation,
ZEP.1.15	a day of darkness and gloom,
ZEP.1.15	a day of clouds and blackness,
ZEP.1.16	a day of trumpet calls and battle cries.
ZEP.1.16	Down go the walled cities
ZEP.1.16	and the strongest battlements!
ZEP.1.17	“Because you have sinned against the 
ZEP.1.17	I will make you grope around like the blind.
ZEP.1.17	Your blood will be poured into the dust,
ZEP.1.17	and your bodies will lie rotting on the ground.”
ZEP.1.18	Your silver and gold will not save you
ZEP.1.18	on that day of the 
ZEP.1.18	For the whole land will be devoured
ZEP.1.18	by the fire of his jealousy.
ZEP.1.18	He will make a terrifying end
ZEP.1.18	of all the people on earth.
ZEP.2.1	Gather together—yes, gather together,
ZEP.2.1	you shameless nation.
ZEP.2.2	Gather before judgment begins,
ZEP.2.2	before your time to repent is blown away like chaff.
ZEP.2.2	Act now, before the fierce fury of the 
ZEP.2.2	and the terrible day of the 
ZEP.2.3	Seek the 
ZEP.2.3	and follow his commands.
ZEP.2.3	Seek to do what is right
ZEP.2.3	and to live humbly.
ZEP.2.3	Perhaps even yet the 
ZEP.2.3	protect you from his anger on that day of destruction.
ZEP.2.4	Gaza and Ashkelon will be abandoned,
ZEP.2.4	Ashdod and Ekron torn down.
ZEP.2.5	And what sorrow awaits you Philistines
ZEP.2.5	who live along the coast and in the land of Canaan,
ZEP.2.5	for this judgment is against you, too!
ZEP.2.5	The 
ZEP.2.5	until not one of you is left.
ZEP.2.6	The Philistine coast will become a wilderness pasture,
ZEP.2.6	a place of shepherd camps
ZEP.2.6	and enclosures for sheep and goats.
ZEP.2.7	The remnant of the tribe of Judah will pasture there.
ZEP.2.7	They will rest at night in the abandoned houses in Ashkelon.
ZEP.2.7	For the 
ZEP.2.7	and restore their prosperity again.
ZEP.2.8	“I have heard the taunts of the Moabites
ZEP.2.8	and the insults of the Ammonites,
ZEP.2.8	mocking my people
ZEP.2.8	and invading their borders.
ZEP.2.9	Now, as surely as I live,”
ZEP.2.9	says the 
ZEP.2.9	“Moab and Ammon will be destroyed—
ZEP.2.9	destroyed as completely as Sodom and Gomorrah.
ZEP.2.9	Their land will become a place of stinging nettles,
ZEP.2.9	salt pits, and eternal desolation.
ZEP.2.9	The remnant of my people will plunder them
ZEP.2.9	and take their land.”
ZEP.2.10	They will receive the wages of their pride,
ZEP.2.10	for they have scoffed at the people of the 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.11	as he destroys all the gods in the land.
ZEP.2.11	Then nations around the world will worship the 
ZEP.2.11	each in their own land.
ZEP.2.12	“You Ethiopians
ZEP.2.12	by my sword,” says the 
ZEP.2.13	And the 
ZEP.2.13	destroying the land of Assyria.
ZEP.2.13	He will make its great capital, Nineveh, a desolate wasteland,
ZEP.2.13	parched like a desert.
ZEP.2.14	The proud city will become a pasture for flocks and herds,
ZEP.2.14	and all sorts of wild animals will settle there.
ZEP.2.14	The desert owl and screech owl will roost on its ruined columns,
ZEP.2.14	their calls echoing through the gaping windows.
ZEP.2.14	Rubble will block all the doorways,
ZEP.2.14	and the cedar paneling will be exposed to the weather.
ZEP.2.15	This is the boisterous city,
ZEP.2.15	once so secure.
ZEP.2.15	“I am the greatest!” it boasted.
ZEP.2.15	“No other city can compare with me!”
ZEP.2.15	But now, look how it has become an utter ruin,
ZEP.2.15	a haven for wild animals.
ZEP.2.15	Everyone passing by will laugh in derision
ZEP.2.15	and shake a defiant fist.
ZEP.3.1	What sorrow awaits rebellious, polluted Jerusalem,
ZEP.3.1	the city of violence and crime!
ZEP.3.2	No one can tell it anything;
ZEP.3.2	it refuses all correction.
ZEP.3.2	It does not trust in the 
ZEP.3.2	or draw near to its God.
ZEP.3.3	Its leaders are like roaring lions
ZEP.3.3	hunting for their victims.
ZEP.3.3	Its judges are like ravenous wolves at evening time,
ZEP.3.3	who by dawn have left no trace of their prey.
ZEP.3.4	Its prophets are arrogant liars seeking their own gain.
ZEP.3.4	Its priests defile the Temple by disobeying God’s instructions.
ZEP.3.5	But the 
ZEP.3.5	and he does no wrong.
ZEP.3.5	Day by day he hands down justice,
ZEP.3.5	and he does not fail.
ZEP.3.5	But the wicked know no shame.
ZEP.3.6	“I have wiped out many nations,
ZEP.3.6	devastating their fortress walls and towers.
ZEP.3.6	Their streets are now deserted;
ZEP.3.6	their cities lie in silent ruin.
ZEP.3.6	There are no survivors—
ZEP.3.6	none at all.
ZEP.3.7	I thought, ‘Surely they will have reverence for me now!
ZEP.3.7	Surely they will listen to my warnings.
ZEP.3.7	Then I won’t need to strike again,
ZEP.3.7	destroying their homes.’
ZEP.3.7	But no, they get up early
ZEP.3.7	to continue their evil deeds.
ZEP.3.8	Therefore, be patient,” says the 
ZEP.3.8	“Soon I will stand and accuse these evil nations.
ZEP.3.8	For I have decided to gather the kingdoms of the earth
ZEP.3.8	and pour out my fiercest anger and fury on them.
ZEP.3.8	All the earth will be devoured
ZEP.3.8	by the fire of my jealousy.
ZEP.3.9	“Then I will purify the speech of all people,
ZEP.3.9	so that everyone can worship the 
ZEP.3.10	My scattered people who live beyond the rivers of Ethiopia
ZEP.3.10	will come to present their offerings.
ZEP.3.11	On that day you will no longer need to be ashamed,
ZEP.3.11	for you will no longer be rebels against me.
ZEP.3.11	I will remove all proud and arrogant people from among you.
ZEP.3.11	There will be no more haughtiness on my holy mountain.
ZEP.3.12	Those who are left will be the lowly and humble,
ZEP.3.12	for it is they who trust in the name of the 
ZEP.3.13	The remnant of Israel will do no wrong;
ZEP.3.13	they will never tell lies or deceive one another.
ZEP.3.13	They will eat and sleep in safety,
ZEP.3.13	and no one will make them afraid.”
ZEP.3.14	Sing, O daughter of Zion;
ZEP.3.14	shout aloud, O Israel!
ZEP.3.14	Be glad and rejoice with all your heart,
ZEP.3.14	O daughter of Jerusalem!
ZEP.3.15	For the 
ZEP.3.15	and will disperse the armies of your enemy.
ZEP.3.15	And the 
ZEP.3.15	will live among you!
ZEP.3.15	At last your troubles will be over,
ZEP.3.15	and you will never again fear disaster.
ZEP.3.16	On that day the announcement to Jerusalem will be,
ZEP.3.16	“Cheer up, Zion! Don’t be afraid!
ZEP.3.17	For the 
ZEP.3.17	He is a mighty savior.
ZEP.3.17	He will take delight in you with gladness.
ZEP.3.17	With his love, he will calm all your fears.
ZEP.3.17	He will rejoice over you with joyful songs.”
ZEP.3.18	“I will gather you who mourn for the appointed festivals;
ZEP.3.18	you will be disgraced no more.
ZEP.3.19	And I will deal severely with all who have oppressed you.
ZEP.3.19	I will save the weak and helpless ones;
ZEP.3.19	I will bring together
ZEP.3.19	those who were chased away.
ZEP.3.19	I will give glory and fame to my former exiles,
ZEP.3.19	wherever they have been mocked and shamed.
ZEP.3.20	On that day I will gather you together
ZEP.3.20	and bring you home again.
ZEP.3.20	I will give you a good name, a name of distinction,
ZEP.3.20	among all the nations of the earth,
ZEP.3.20	as I restore your fortunes before their very eyes.
ZEP.3.20	I, the 
HAG.1.1	On August 29
HAG.1.2	“This is what the 
HAG.1.3	Then the 
HAG.1.4	“Why are you living in luxurious houses while my house lies in ruins? 
HAG.1.5	This is what the 
HAG.1.6	You have planted much but harvest little. You eat but are not satisfied. You drink but are still thirsty. You put on clothes but cannot keep warm. Your wages disappear as though you were putting them in pockets filled with holes!
HAG.1.7	“This is what the 
HAG.1.8	Now go up into the hills, bring down timber, and rebuild my house. Then I will take pleasure in it and be honored, says the 
HAG.1.9	You hoped for rich harvests, but they were poor. And when you brought your harvest home, I blew it away. Why? Because my house lies in ruins, says the 
HAG.1.10	It’s because of you that the heavens withhold the dew and the earth produces no crops. 
HAG.1.11	I have called for a drought on your fields and hills—a drought to wither the grain and grapes and olive trees and all your other crops, a drought to starve you and your livestock and to ruin everything you have worked so hard to get.”
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of God’s people began to obey the message from the 
HAG.1.13	Then Haggai, the 
HAG.1.14	So the 
HAG.1.15	on September 21
HAG.2.1	Then on October 17 of that same year,
HAG.2.2	“Say this to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Jeshua
HAG.2.3	‘Does anyone remember this house—this Temple—in its former splendor? How, in comparison, does it look to you now? It must seem like nothing at all! 
HAG.2.4	But now the 
HAG.2.5	My Spirit remains among you, just as I promised when you came out of Egypt. So do not be afraid.’
HAG.2.6	“For this is what the 
HAG.2.7	I will shake all the nations, and the treasures of all the nations will be brought to this Temple. I will fill this place with glory, says the 
HAG.2.8	The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the 
HAG.2.9	The future glory of this Temple will be greater than its past glory, says the 
HAG.2.10	On December 18
HAG.2.11	“This is what the 
HAG.2.12	‘If one of you is carrying some meat from a holy sacrifice in his robes and his robe happens to brush against some bread or stew, wine or olive oil, or any other kind of food, will it also become holy?’”
HAG.2.12	The priests replied, “No.”
HAG.2.13	Then Haggai asked, “If someone becomes ceremonially unclean by touching a dead person and then touches any of these foods, will the food be defiled?”
HAG.2.13	And the priests answered, “Yes.”
HAG.2.14	Then Haggai responded, “That is how it is with this people and this nation, says the 
HAG.2.15	Look at what was happening to you before you began to lay the foundation of the 
HAG.2.16	When you hoped for a twenty-bushel crop, you harvested only ten. When you expected to draw fifty gallons from the winepress, you found only twenty. 
HAG.2.17	I sent blight and mildew and hail to destroy everything you worked so hard to produce. Even so, you refused to return to me, says the 
HAG.2.18	“Think about this eighteenth day of December, the day
HAG.2.19	I am giving you a promise now while the seed is still in the barn.
HAG.2.20	On that same day, December 18,
HAG.2.21	“Tell Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, that I am about to shake the heavens and the earth. 
HAG.2.22	I will overthrow royal thrones and destroy the power of foreign kingdoms. I will overturn their chariots and riders. The horses will fall, and their riders will kill each other.
HAG.2.23	“But when this happens, says the 
ZEC.1.1	In November
ZEC.1.2	“I, the 
ZEC.1.3	Therefore, say to the people, ‘This is what the 
ZEC.1.4	Don’t be like your ancestors who would not listen or pay attention when the earlier prophets said to them, ‘This is what the 
ZEC.1.5	“Where are your ancestors now? They and the prophets are long dead. 
ZEC.1.6	But everything I said through my servants the prophets happened to your ancestors, just as I said. As a result, they repented and said, ‘We have received what we deserved from the 
ZEC.1.7	Three months later, on February 15,
ZEC.1.8	In a vision during the night, I saw a man sitting on a red horse that was standing among some myrtle trees in a small valley. Behind him were riders on red, brown, and white horses. 
ZEC.1.9	I asked the angel who was talking with me, “My lord, what do these horses mean?”
ZEC.1.9	“I will show you,” the angel replied.
ZEC.1.10	The rider standing among the myrtle trees then explained, “They are the ones the 
ZEC.1.11	Then the other riders reported to the angel of the 
ZEC.1.12	Upon hearing this, the angel of the 
ZEC.1.13	And the 
ZEC.1.14	Then the angel said to me, “Shout this message for all to hear: ‘This is what the 
ZEC.1.15	But I am very angry with the other nations that are now enjoying peace and security. I was only a little angry with my people, but the nations inflicted harm on them far beyond my intentions.
ZEC.1.16	“‘Therefore, this is what the 
ZEC.1.17	“Say this also: ‘This is what the 
ZEC.1.18	Then I looked up and saw four animal horns. 
ZEC.1.19	“What are these?” I asked the angel who was talking with me.
ZEC.1.19	He replied, “These horns represent the nations that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
ZEC.1.20	Then the 
ZEC.1.21	“What are these men coming to do?” I asked.
ZEC.1.21	The angel replied, “These four horns—these nations—scattered and humbled Judah. Now these blacksmiths have come to terrify those nations and throw them down and destroy them.”
ZEC.2.1	When I looked again, I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
ZEC.2.2	“Where are you going?” I asked.
ZEC.2.2	He replied, “I am going to measure Jerusalem, to see how wide and how long it is.”
ZEC.2.3	Then the angel who was with me went to meet a second angel who was coming toward him. 
ZEC.2.4	The other angel said, “Hurry, and say to that young man, ‘Jerusalem will someday be so full of people and livestock that there won’t be room enough for everyone! Many will live outside the city walls. 
ZEC.2.5	Then I, myself, will be a protective wall of fire around Jerusalem, says the 
ZEC.2.6	The 
ZEC.2.7	Come away, people of Zion, you who are exiled in Babylon!”
ZEC.2.8	After a period of glory, the 
ZEC.2.9	I will raise my fist to crush them, and their own slaves will plunder them.” Then you will know that the 
ZEC.2.10	The 
ZEC.2.11	Many nations will join themselves to the 
ZEC.2.12	The land of Judah will be the 
ZEC.2.13	Be silent before the 
ZEC.3.1	Then the angel showed me Jeshua
ZEC.3.2	And the 
ZEC.3.3	Jeshua’s clothing was filthy as he stood there before the angel. 
ZEC.3.4	So the angel said to the others standing there, “Take off his filthy clothes.” And turning to Jeshua he said, “See, I have taken away your sins, and now I am giving you these fine new clothes.”
ZEC.3.5	Then I said, “They should also place a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean priestly turban on his head and dressed him in new clothes while the angel of the 
ZEC.3.6	Then the angel of the 
ZEC.3.7	“This is what the 
ZEC.3.8	“Listen to me, O Jeshua the high priest, and all you other priests. You are symbols of things to come. Soon I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. 
ZEC.3.9	Now look at the jewel I have set before Jeshua, a single stone with seven facets.
ZEC.3.10	“And on that day, says the 
ZEC.4.1	Then the angel who had been talking with me returned and woke me, as though I had been asleep. 
ZEC.4.2	“What do you see now?” he asked.
ZEC.4.2	I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl of oil on top of it. Around the bowl are seven lamps, each having seven spouts with wicks. 
ZEC.4.3	And I see two olive trees, one on each side of the bowl.” 
ZEC.4.4	Then I asked the angel, “What are these, my lord? What do they mean?”
ZEC.4.5	“Don’t you know?” the angel asked.
ZEC.4.5	“No, my lord,” I replied.
ZEC.4.6	Then he said to me, “This is what the 
ZEC.4.7	Nothing, not even a mighty mountain, will stand in Zerubbabel’s way; it will become a level plain before him! And when Zerubbabel sets the final stone of the Temple in place, the people will shout: ‘May God bless it! May God bless it!’
ZEC.4.8	Then another message came to me from the 
ZEC.4.9	“Zerubbabel is the one who laid the foundation of this Temple, and he will complete it. Then you will know that the 
ZEC.4.10	Do not despise these small beginnings, for the 
ZEC.4.10	 (The seven lamps
ZEC.4.11	Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on each side of the lampstand, 
ZEC.4.12	and what are the two olive branches that pour out golden oil through two gold tubes?”
ZEC.4.13	“Don’t you know?” he asked.
ZEC.4.13	“No, my lord,” I replied.
ZEC.4.14	Then he said to me, “They represent the two anointed ones
ZEC.5.1	I looked up again and saw a scroll flying through the air.
ZEC.5.2	“What do you see?” the angel asked.
ZEC.5.2	“I see a flying scroll,” I replied. “It appears to be about 30 feet long and 15 feet wide.
ZEC.5.3	Then he said to me, “This scroll contains the curse that is going out over the entire land. One side of the scroll says that those who steal will be banished from the land; the other side says that those who swear falsely will be banished from the land. 
ZEC.5.4	And this is what the 
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel who was talking with me came forward and said, “Look up and see what’s coming.”
ZEC.5.6	“What is it?” I asked.
ZEC.5.6	He replied, “It is a basket for measuring grain,
ZEC.5.7	Then the heavy lead cover was lifted off the basket, and there was a woman sitting inside it. 
ZEC.5.8	The angel said, “The woman’s name is Wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and closed the heavy lid again.
ZEC.5.9	Then I looked up and saw two women flying toward us, gliding on the wind. They had wings like a stork, and they picked up the basket and flew into the sky.
ZEC.5.10	“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel.
ZEC.5.11	He replied, “To the land of Babylonia,
ZEC.6.1	Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two bronze mountains. 
ZEC.6.2	The first chariot was pulled by red horses, the second by black horses, 
ZEC.6.3	the third by white horses, and the fourth by powerful dappled-gray horses. 
ZEC.6.4	“And what are these, my lord?” I asked the angel who was talking with me.
ZEC.6.5	The angel replied, “These are the four spirits
ZEC.6.6	The chariot with black horses is going north, the chariot with white horses is going west,
ZEC.6.7	The powerful horses were eager to set out to patrol the earth. And the 
ZEC.6.8	Then the 
ZEC.6.9	Then I received another message from the 
ZEC.6.10	“Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah will bring gifts of silver and gold from the Jews exiled in Babylon. As soon as they arrive, meet them at the home of Josiah son of Zephaniah. 
ZEC.6.11	Accept their gifts, and make a crown from the silver and gold. Then put the crown on the head of Jeshua
ZEC.6.12	Tell him, ‘This is what the 
ZEC.6.13	Yes, he will build the Temple of the 
ZEC.6.14	“The crown will be a memorial in the Temple of the 
ZEC.6.15	People will come from distant lands to rebuild the Temple of the 
ZEC.7.1	On December 7
ZEC.7.2	The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech,
ZEC.7.3	They were to ask this question of the prophets and the priests at the Temple of the 
ZEC.7.4	The 
ZEC.7.5	“Say to all your people and your priests, ‘During these seventy years of exile, when you fasted and mourned in the summer and in early autumn,
ZEC.7.6	And even now in your holy festivals, aren’t you eating and drinking just to please yourselves? 
ZEC.7.7	Isn’t this the same message the 
ZEC.7.8	Then this message came to Zechariah from the 
ZEC.7.9	“This is what the 
ZEC.7.10	Do not oppress widows, orphans, foreigners, and the poor. And do not scheme against each other.
ZEC.7.11	“Your ancestors refused to listen to this message. They stubbornly turned away and put their fingers in their ears to keep from hearing. 
ZEC.7.12	They made their hearts as hard as stone, so they could not hear the instructions or the messages that the 
ZEC.7.13	“Since they refused to listen when I called to them, I would not listen when they called to me, says the 
ZEC.7.14	As with a whirlwind, I scattered them among the distant nations, where they lived as strangers. Their land became so desolate that no one even traveled through it. They turned their pleasant land into a desert.”
ZEC.8.1	Then another message came to me from the 
ZEC.8.2	“This is what the 
ZEC.8.3	“And now the 
ZEC.8.4	“This is what the 
ZEC.8.5	And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls at play.
ZEC.8.6	“This is what the 
ZEC.8.7	“This is what the 
ZEC.8.8	I will bring them home again to live safely in Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be faithful and just toward them as their God.
ZEC.8.9	“This is what the 
ZEC.8.10	Before the work on the Temple began, there were no jobs and no money to hire people or animals. No traveler was safe from the enemy, for there were enemies on all sides. I had turned everyone against each other.
ZEC.8.11	“But now I will not treat the remnant of my people as I treated them before, says the 
ZEC.8.12	For I am planting seeds of peace and prosperity among you. The grapevines will be heavy with fruit. The earth will produce its crops, and the heavens will release the dew. Once more I will cause the remnant in Judah and Israel to inherit these blessings. 
ZEC.8.13	Among the other nations, Judah and Israel became symbols of a cursed nation. But no longer! Now I will rescue you and make you both a symbol and a source of blessing. So don’t be afraid. Be strong, and get on with rebuilding the Temple!
ZEC.8.14	“For this is what the 
ZEC.8.15	But now I am determined to bless Jerusalem and the people of Judah. So don’t be afraid. 
ZEC.8.16	But this is what you must do: Tell the truth to each other. Render verdicts in your courts that are just and that lead to peace. 
ZEC.8.17	Don’t scheme against each other. Stop your love of telling lies that you swear are the truth. I hate all these things, says the 
ZEC.8.18	Here is another message that came to me from the 
ZEC.8.19	“This is what the 
ZEC.8.20	“This is what the 
ZEC.8.21	The people of one city will say to the people of another, ‘Come with us to Jerusalem to ask the 
ZEC.8.22	Many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the 
ZEC.8.23	“This is what the 
ZEC.9.1	This is the message
ZEC.9.2	Doom is certain for Hamath,
ZEC.9.2	near Damascus,
ZEC.9.2	and for the cities of Tyre and Sidon,
ZEC.9.2	though they are so clever.
ZEC.9.3	Tyre has built a strong fortress
ZEC.9.3	and has made silver and gold
ZEC.9.3	as plentiful as dust in the streets!
ZEC.9.4	But now the Lord will strip away Tyre’s possessions
ZEC.9.4	and hurl its fortifications into the sea,
ZEC.9.4	and it will be burned to the ground.
ZEC.9.5	The city of Ashkelon will see Tyre fall
ZEC.9.5	and will be filled with fear.
ZEC.9.5	Gaza will shake with terror,
ZEC.9.5	as will Ekron, for their hopes will be dashed.
ZEC.9.5	Gaza’s king will be killed,
ZEC.9.5	and Ashkelon will be deserted.
ZEC.9.6	Foreigners will occupy the city of Ashdod.
ZEC.9.6	I will destroy the pride of the Philistines.
ZEC.9.7	I will grab the bloody meat from their mouths
ZEC.9.7	and snatch the detestable sacrifices from their teeth.
ZEC.9.7	Then the surviving Philistines will worship our God
ZEC.9.7	and become like a clan in Judah.
ZEC.9.7	The Philistines of Ekron will join my people,
ZEC.9.7	as the ancient Jebusites once did.
ZEC.9.8	I will guard my Temple
ZEC.9.8	and protect it from invading armies.
ZEC.9.8	I am watching closely to ensure
ZEC.9.8	that no more foreign oppressors overrun my people’s land.
ZEC.9.9	Rejoice, O people of Zion!
ZEC.9.9	Shout in triumph, O people of Jerusalem!
ZEC.9.9	Look, your king is coming to you.
ZEC.9.9	He is righteous and victorious,
ZEC.9.9	yet he is humble, riding on a donkey—
ZEC.9.9	riding on a donkey’s colt.
ZEC.9.10	I will remove the battle chariots from Israel
ZEC.9.10	and the warhorses from Jerusalem.
ZEC.9.10	I will destroy all the weapons used in battle,
ZEC.9.10	and your king will bring peace to the nations.
ZEC.9.10	His realm will stretch from sea to sea
ZEC.9.10	and from the Euphrates River
ZEC.9.11	Because of the covenant I made with you,
ZEC.9.11	sealed with blood,
ZEC.9.11	I will free your prisoners
ZEC.9.11	from death in a waterless dungeon.
ZEC.9.12	Come back to the place of safety,
ZEC.9.12	all you prisoners who still have hope!
ZEC.9.12	I promise this very day
ZEC.9.12	that I will repay two blessings for each of your troubles.
ZEC.9.13	Judah is my bow,
ZEC.9.13	and Israel is my arrow.
ZEC.9.13	Jerusalem
ZEC.9.13	and like a warrior, I will brandish it against the Greeks.

ZEC.9.14	The Sovereign 
ZEC.9.14	and attack like a whirlwind from the southern desert.
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.15	and they will defeat their enemies by hurling great stones.
ZEC.9.15	They will shout in battle as though drunk with wine.
ZEC.9.15	They will be filled with blood like a bowl,
ZEC.9.15	drenched with blood like the corners of the altar.
ZEC.9.16	On that day the 
ZEC.9.16	just as a shepherd rescues his sheep.
ZEC.9.16	They will sparkle in his land
ZEC.9.16	like jewels in a crown.
ZEC.9.17	How wonderful and beautiful they will be!
ZEC.9.17	The young men will thrive on abundant grain,
ZEC.9.17	and the young women will flourish on new wine.
ZEC.10.1	Ask the 
ZEC.10.1	for he makes the storm clouds.
ZEC.10.1	And he will send showers of rain
ZEC.10.1	so every field becomes a lush pasture.
ZEC.10.2	Household gods give worthless advice,
ZEC.10.2	fortune-tellers predict only lies,
ZEC.10.2	and interpreters of dreams pronounce
ZEC.10.2	falsehoods that give no comfort.
ZEC.10.2	So my people are wandering like lost sheep;
ZEC.10.2	they are attacked because they have no shepherd.
ZEC.10.3	“My anger burns against your shepherds,
ZEC.10.3	and I will punish these leaders.
ZEC.10.3	For the 
ZEC.10.3	to look after Judah, his flock.
ZEC.10.3	He will make them strong and glorious,
ZEC.10.3	like a proud warhorse in battle.
ZEC.10.4	From Judah will come the cornerstone,
ZEC.10.4	the tent peg,
ZEC.10.4	the bow for battle,
ZEC.10.4	and all the rulers.
ZEC.10.5	They will be like mighty warriors in battle,
ZEC.10.5	trampling their enemies in the mud under their feet.
ZEC.10.5	Since the 
ZEC.10.5	they will overthrow even the enemy’s horsemen.
ZEC.10.6	“I will strengthen Judah and save Israel
ZEC.10.6	I will restore them because of my compassion.
ZEC.10.6	It will be as though I had never rejected them,
ZEC.10.6	for I am the 
ZEC.10.7	The people of Israel
ZEC.10.7	and their hearts will be made happy as if by wine.
ZEC.10.7	Their children, too, will see it and be glad;
ZEC.10.7	their hearts will rejoice in the 
ZEC.10.8	When I whistle to them, they will come running,
ZEC.10.8	for I have redeemed them.
ZEC.10.8	From the few who are left,
ZEC.10.8	they will grow as numerous as they were before.
ZEC.10.9	Though I have scattered them like seeds among the nations,
ZEC.10.9	they will still remember me in distant lands.
ZEC.10.9	They and their children will survive
ZEC.10.9	and return again to Israel.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them back from Egypt
ZEC.10.10	and gather them from Assyria.
ZEC.10.10	I will resettle them in Gilead and Lebanon
ZEC.10.10	until there is no more room for them all.
ZEC.10.11	They will pass safely through the sea of distress,
ZEC.10.11	for the waves of the sea will be held back,
ZEC.10.11	and the waters of the Nile will dry up.
ZEC.10.11	The pride of Assyria will be crushed,
ZEC.10.11	and the rule of Egypt will end.
ZEC.10.12	By my power
ZEC.10.12	and by my authority they will go wherever they wish.
ZEC.10.12	I, the 
ZEC.11.1	Open your doors, Lebanon,
ZEC.11.1	so that fire may devour your cedar forests.
ZEC.11.2	Weep, you cypress trees, for all the ruined cedars;
ZEC.11.2	the most majestic ones have fallen.
ZEC.11.2	Weep, you oaks of Bashan,
ZEC.11.2	for the thick forests have been cut down.
ZEC.11.3	Listen to the wailing of the shepherds,
ZEC.11.3	for their rich pastures are destroyed.
ZEC.11.3	Hear the young lions roaring,
ZEC.11.3	for their thickets in the Jordan Valley are ruined.
ZEC.11.4	This is what the 
ZEC.11.5	The buyers slaughter their sheep without remorse. The sellers say, ‘Praise the 
ZEC.11.6	Likewise, I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,” says the 
ZEC.11.7	So I cared for the flock intended for slaughter—the flock that was oppressed. Then I took two shepherd’s staffs and named one Favor and the other Union. 
ZEC.11.8	I got rid of their three evil shepherds in a single month.
ZEC.11.8	But I became impatient with these sheep, and they hated me, too. 
ZEC.11.9	So I told them, “I won’t be your shepherd any longer. If you die, you die. If you are killed, you are killed. And let those who remain devour each other!”
ZEC.11.10	Then I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two, showing that I had revoked the covenant I had made with all the nations. 
ZEC.11.11	That was the end of my covenant with them. The suffering flock was watching me, and they knew that the 
ZEC.11.12	And I said to them, “If you like, give me my wages, whatever I am worth; but only if you want to.” So they counted out for my wages thirty pieces of silver.
ZEC.11.13	And the 
ZEC.11.14	Then I took my other staff, Union, and cut it in two, showing that the bond of unity between Judah and Israel was broken.
ZEC.11.15	Then the 
ZEC.11.16	This illustrates how I will give this nation a shepherd who will not care for those who are dying, nor look after the young, nor heal the injured, nor feed the healthy. Instead, this shepherd will eat the meat of the fattest sheep and tear off their hooves.
ZEC.11.17	“What sorrow awaits this worthless shepherd
ZEC.11.17	who abandons the flock!
ZEC.11.17	The sword will cut his arm
ZEC.11.17	and pierce his right eye.
ZEC.11.17	His arm will become useless,
ZEC.11.17	and his right eye completely blind.”
ZEC.12.1	This
ZEC.12.2	I will make Jerusalem like an intoxicating drink that makes the nearby nations stagger when they send their armies to besiege Jerusalem and Judah. 
ZEC.12.3	On that day I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock. All the nations will gather against it to try to move it, but they will only hurt themselves.
ZEC.12.4	“On that day,” says the 
ZEC.12.5	And the clans of Judah will say to themselves, ‘The people of Jerusalem have found strength in the 
ZEC.12.6	“On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a flame that sets a woodpile ablaze or like a burning torch among sheaves of grain. They will burn up all the neighboring nations right and left, while the people living in Jerusalem remain secure.
ZEC.12.7	“The 
ZEC.12.8	On that day the 
ZEC.12.9	For on that day I will begin to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.10	“Then I will pour out a spirit
ZEC.12.11	The sorrow and mourning in Jerusalem on that day will be like the great mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo.
ZEC.12.12	“All Israel will mourn, each clan by itself, and with the husbands separate from their wives. The clan of David will mourn alone, as will the clan of Nathan,

MAT.1.11	Josiah was the father of Jehoiachin
MAT.1.12	After the Babylonian exile:
MAT.1.12	Jehoiachin was the father of Shealtiel.
MAT.1.12	Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
MAT.1.13	Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud.
MAT.1.13	Abiud was the father of Eliakim.
MAT.1.13	Eliakim was the father of Azor.
MAT.1.14	Azor was the father of Zadok.

MAT.1.14	Akim was the father of Eliud.
MAT.1.15	Eliud was the father of Eleazar.
MAT.1.15	Eleazar was the father of Matthan.
MAT.1.15	Matthan was the father of Jacob.
MAT.1.16	Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary.
MAT.1.16	Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
MAT.1.17	All those listed above include fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah.
MAT.1.18	This is how Jesus the Messiah was born. His mother, Mary, was engaged to be married to Joseph. But before the marriage took place, while she was still a virgin, she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit. 
MAT.1.19	Joseph, to whom she was engaged, was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her publicly, so he decided to break the engagement
MAT.1.20	As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. “Joseph, son of David,” the angel said, “do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For the child within her was conceived by the Holy Spirit. 
MAT.1.21	And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus,
MAT.1.22	All of this occurred to fulfill the Lord’s message through his prophet:
MAT.1.23	“Look! The virgin will conceive a child!
MAT.1.23	She will give birth to a son,
MAT.1.23	and they will call him Immanuel,
MAT.1.23	which means ‘God is with us.’”
MAT.1.24	When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded and took Mary as his wife. 
MAT.1.25	But he did not have sexual relations with her until her son was born. And Joseph named him Jesus.
MAT.2.1	Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. About that time some wise men
MAT.2.2	“Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star as it rose,
MAT.2.3	King Herod was deeply disturbed when he heard this, as was everyone in Jerusalem. 
MAT.2.4	He called a meeting of the leading priests and teachers of religious law and asked, “Where is the Messiah supposed to be born?”
MAT.2.5	“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they said, “for this is what the prophet wrote:
MAT.2.6	‘And you, O Bethlehem in the land of Judah,
MAT.2.6	are not least among the ruling cities
MAT.2.6	for a ruler will come from you
MAT.2.6	who will be the shepherd for my people Israel.’
MAT.2.7	Then Herod called for a private meeting with the wise men, and he learned from them the time when the star first appeared. 
MAT.2.8	Then he told them, “Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child. And when you find him, come back and tell me so that I can go and worship him, too!”
MAT.2.9	After this interview the wise men went their way. And the star they had seen in the east guided them to Bethlehem. It went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was. 
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star, they were filled with joy! 
MAT.2.11	They entered the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
MAT.2.12	When it was time to leave, they returned to their own country by another route, for God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.
MAT.2.13	After the wise men were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up! Flee to Egypt with the child and his mother,” the angel said. “Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”
MAT.2.14	That night Joseph left for Egypt with the child and Mary, his mother, 
MAT.2.15	and they stayed there until Herod’s death. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “I called my Son out of Egypt.”
MAT.2.16	Herod was furious when he realized that the wise men had outwitted him. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, based on the wise men’s report of the star’s first appearance. 
MAT.2.17	Herod’s brutal action fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:
MAT.2.18	“A cry was heard in Ramah—
MAT.2.18	weeping and great mourning.
MAT.2.18	Rachel weeps for her children,
MAT.2.18	refusing to be comforted,
MAT.2.18	for they are dead.”
MAT.2.19	When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt. 
MAT.2.20	“Get up!” the angel said. “Take the child and his mother back to the land of Israel, because those who were trying to kill the child are dead.”
MAT.2.21	So Joseph got up and returned to the land of Israel with Jesus and his mother. 
MAT.2.22	But when he learned that the new ruler of Judea was Herod’s son Archelaus, he was afraid to go there. Then, after being warned in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee. 
MAT.2.23	So the family went and lived in a town called Nazareth. This fulfilled what the prophets had said: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
MAT.3.1	In those days John the Baptist came to the Judean wilderness and began preaching. His message was, 
MAT.3.2	“Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.
MAT.3.3	The prophet Isaiah was speaking about John when he said,
MAT.3.3	“He is a voice shouting in the wilderness,
MAT.3.3	‘Prepare the way for the 
MAT.3.3	Clear the road for him!’”
MAT.3.4	John’s clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey. 
MAT.3.5	People from Jerusalem and from all of Judea and all over the Jordan Valley went out to see and hear John. 
MAT.3.6	And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.
MAT.3.7	But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to watch him baptize,
MAT.3.8	Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. 
MAT.3.9	Don’t just say to each other, ‘We’re safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.’ That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones. 
MAT.3.10	Even now the ax of God’s judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.
MAT.3.11	“I baptize with
MAT.3.12	He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.”
MAT.3.13	Then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John. 
MAT.3.14	But John tried to talk him out of it. “I am the one who needs to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why are you coming to me?”
MAT.3.15	But Jesus said, 
MAT.3.16	After his baptism, as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened
MAT.3.17	And a voice from heaven said, “This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy.”
MAT.4.1	Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil. 
MAT.4.2	For forty days and forty nights he fasted and became very hungry.
MAT.4.3	During that time the devil
MAT.4.4	But Jesus told him, 
MAT.4.5	Then the devil took him to the holy city, Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple, 
MAT.4.6	and said, “If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the Scriptures say,
MAT.4.6	‘He will order his angels to protect you.
MAT.4.6	And they will hold you up with their hands
MAT.4.6	so you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone.’
MAT.4.7	Jesus responded, 
MAT.4.8	Next the devil took him to the peak of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 
MAT.4.9	“I will give it all to you,” he said, “if you will kneel down and worship me.”
MAT.4.10	 Jesus told him. 
MAT.4.11	Then the devil went away, and angels came and took care of Jesus.
MAT.4.12	When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he left Judea and returned to Galilee. 
MAT.4.13	He went first to Nazareth, then left there and moved to Capernaum, beside the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. 
MAT.4.14	This fulfilled what God said through the prophet Isaiah:
MAT.4.15	“In the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali,
MAT.4.15	beside the sea, beyond the Jordan River,
MAT.4.15	in Galilee where so many Gentiles live,
MAT.4.16	the people who sat in darkness
MAT.4.16	have seen a great light.
MAT.4.16	And for those who lived in the land where death casts its shadow,
MAT.4.16	a light has shined.”
MAT.4.17	From then on Jesus began to preach, 
MAT.4.18	One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers—Simon, also called Peter, and Andrew—throwing a net into the water, for they fished for a living. 
MAT.4.19	Jesus called out to them, 
MAT.4.20	And they left their nets at once and followed him.
MAT.4.21	A little farther up the shore he saw two other brothers, James and John, sitting in a boat with their father, Zebedee, repairing their nets. And he called them to come, too. 
MAT.4.22	They immediately followed him, leaving the boat and their father behind.
MAT.4.23	Jesus traveled throughout the region of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness. 
MAT.4.24	News about him spread as far as Syria, and people soon began bringing to him all who were sick. And whatever their sickness or disease, or if they were demon possessed or epileptic or paralyzed—he healed them all. 
MAT.4.25	Large crowds followed him wherever he went—people from Galilee, the Ten Towns,
MAT.5.1	One day as he saw the crowds gathering, Jesus went up on the mountainside and sat down. His disciples gathered around him, 
MAT.5.2	and he began to teach them.
MAT.7.28	When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, 
MAT.7.29	for he taught with real authority—quite unlike their teachers of religious law.
MAT.8.1	Large crowds followed Jesus as he came down the mountainside. 
MAT.8.2	Suddenly, a man with leprosy approached him and knelt before him. “Lord,” the man said, “if you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean.”
MAT.8.3	Jesus reached out and touched him. 
MAT.8.4	Then Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.5	When Jesus returned to Capernaum, a Roman officer
MAT.8.6	“Lord, my young servant
MAT.8.7	Jesus said, 
MAT.8.8	But the officer said, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come into my home. Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed. 
MAT.8.9	I know this because I am under the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my soldiers. I only need to say, ‘Go,’ and they go, or ‘Come,’ and they come. And if I say to my slaves, ‘Do this,’ they do it.”
MAT.8.10	When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to those who were following him, he said, 
MAT.8.13	Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, 
MAT.8.14	When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house, Peter’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a high fever. 
MAT.8.15	But when Jesus touched her hand, the fever left her. Then she got up and prepared a meal for him.
MAT.8.16	That evening many demon-possessed people were brought to Jesus. He cast out the evil spirits with a simple command, and he healed all the sick. 
MAT.8.17	This fulfilled the word of the Lord through the prophet Isaiah, who said,
MAT.8.17	“He took our sicknesses
MAT.8.17	and removed our diseases.”
MAT.8.18	When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he instructed his disciples to cross to the other side of the lake.
MAT.8.19	Then one of the teachers of religious law said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
MAT.8.20	But Jesus replied, 
MAT.8.21	Another of his disciples said, “Lord, first let me return home and bury my father.”
MAT.8.22	But Jesus told him, 
MAT.8.23	Then Jesus got into the boat and started across the lake with his disciples. 
MAT.8.24	Suddenly, a fierce storm struck the lake, with waves breaking into the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. 
MAT.8.25	The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, “Lord, save us! We’re going to drown!”
MAT.8.26	Jesus responded, 
MAT.8.27	The disciples were amazed. “Who is this man?” they asked. “Even the winds and waves obey him!”
MAT.8.28	When Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes,
MAT.8.29	They began screaming at him, “Why are you interfering with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before God’s appointed time?”
MAT.8.30	There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding in the distance. 
MAT.8.31	So the demons begged, “If you cast us out, send us into that herd of pigs.”
MAT.8.32	 Jesus commanded them. So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs, and the whole herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water.
MAT.8.33	The herdsmen fled to the nearby town, telling everyone what happened to the demon-possessed men. 
MAT.8.34	Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus, but they begged him to go away and leave them alone.
MAT.9.1	Jesus climbed into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town. 
MAT.9.2	Some people brought to him a paralyzed man on a mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, 
MAT.9.3	But some of the teachers of religious law said to themselves, “That’s blasphemy! Does he think he’s God?”
MAT.9.4	Jesus knew
MAT.9.6	 Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, 
MAT.9.7	And the man jumped up and went home! 
MAT.9.8	Fear swept through the crowd as they saw this happen. And they praised God for giving humans such authority.
MAT.9.9	As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at his tax collector’s booth. 
MAT.9.10	Later, Matthew invited Jesus and his disciples to his home as dinner guests, along with many tax collectors and other disreputable sinners. 
MAT.9.11	But when the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with such scum?
MAT.9.12	When Jesus heard this, he said, 
MAT.9.13	Then he added, 
MAT.9.14	One day the disciples of John the Baptist came to Jesus and asked him, “Why don’t your disciples fast
MAT.9.15	Jesus replied, 
MAT.9.18	As Jesus was saying this, the leader of a synagogue came and knelt before him. “My daughter has just died,” he said, “but you can bring her back to life again if you just come and lay your hand on her.”
MAT.9.19	So Jesus and his disciples got up and went with him. 
MAT.9.20	Just then a woman who had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding came up behind him. She touched the fringe of his robe, 
MAT.9.21	for she thought, “If I can just touch his robe, I will be healed.”
MAT.9.22	Jesus turned around, and when he saw her he said, 
MAT.9.23	When Jesus arrived at the official’s home, he saw the noisy crowd and heard the funeral music. 
MAT.9.24	 he told them. 
MAT.9.25	After the crowd was put outside, however, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she stood up! 
MAT.9.26	The report of this miracle swept through the entire countryside.
MAT.9.27	After Jesus left the girl’s home, two blind men followed along behind him, shouting, “Son of David, have mercy on us!”
MAT.9.28	They went right into the house where he was staying, and Jesus asked them, 
MAT.9.28	“Yes, Lord,” they told him, “we do.”
MAT.9.29	Then he touched their eyes and said, 
MAT.9.30	Then their eyes were opened, and they could see! Jesus sternly warned them, 
MAT.9.31	But instead, they went out and spread his fame all over the region.
MAT.9.32	When they left, a demon-possessed man who couldn’t speak was brought to Jesus. 
MAT.9.33	So Jesus cast out the demon, and then the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed. “Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel!” they exclaimed.
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees said, “He can cast out demons because he is empowered by the prince of demons.”
MAT.9.35	Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages of that area, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness. 
MAT.9.36	When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were confused and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 
MAT.9.37	He said to his disciples, 
MAT.10.1	Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority to cast out evil
MAT.10.2	Here are the names of the twelve apostles:
MAT.10.2	first, Simon (also called Peter),
MAT.10.2	then Andrew (Peter’s brother),
MAT.10.2	James (son of Zebedee),
MAT.10.2	John (James’s brother),
MAT.10.3	Philip,
MAT.10.3	Bartholomew,
MAT.10.3	Thomas,
MAT.10.3	Matthew (the tax collector),
MAT.10.3	James (son of Alphaeus),
MAT.10.3	Thaddaeus,
MAT.10.4	Simon (the zealot
MAT.10.4	Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).
MAT.10.5	Jesus sent out the twelve apostles with these instructions: 
MAT.11.1	When Jesus had finished giving these instructions to his twelve disciples, he went out to teach and preach in towns throughout the region.
MAT.11.2	John the Baptist, who was in prison, heard about all the things the Messiah was doing. So he sent his disciples to ask Jesus, 
MAT.11.3	“Are you the Messiah we’ve been expecting,
MAT.11.4	Jesus told them, 
MAT.11.7	As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. 
MAT.11.20	Then Jesus began to denounce the towns where he had done so many of his miracles, because they hadn’t repented of their sins and turned to God. 
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus prayed this prayer: 
MAT.11.28	Then Jesus said, 
MAT.12.1	At about that time Jesus was walking through some grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, so they began breaking off some heads of grain and eating them. 
MAT.12.2	But some Pharisees saw them do it and protested, “Look, your disciples are breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath.”
MAT.12.3	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.12.9	Then Jesus went over to their synagogue, 
MAT.12.10	where he noticed a man with a deformed hand. The Pharisees asked Jesus, “Does the law permit a person to work by healing on the Sabbath?” (They were hoping he would say yes, so they could bring charges against him.)
MAT.12.11	And he answered, 
MAT.12.13	Then he said to the man, 
MAT.12.14	Then the Pharisees called a meeting to plot how to kill Jesus.
MAT.12.15	But Jesus knew what they were planning. So he left that area, and many people followed him. He healed all the sick among them, 
MAT.12.16	but he warned them not to reveal who he was. 
MAT.12.17	This fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah concerning him:
MAT.12.18	“Look at my Servant, whom I have chosen.
MAT.12.18	He is my Beloved, who pleases me.
MAT.12.18	I will put my Spirit upon him,
MAT.12.18	and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
MAT.12.19	He will not fight or shout
MAT.12.19	or raise his voice in public.
MAT.12.20	He will not crush the weakest reed
MAT.12.20	or put out a flickering candle.
MAT.12.20	Finally he will cause justice to be victorious.
MAT.12.21	And his name will be the hope
MAT.12.21	of all the world.”
MAT.12.22	Then a demon-possessed man, who was blind and couldn’t speak, was brought to Jesus. He healed the man so that he could both speak and see. 
MAT.12.23	The crowd was amazed and asked, “Could it be that Jesus is the Son of David, the Messiah?”
MAT.12.24	But when the Pharisees heard about the miracle, they said, “No wonder he can cast out demons. He gets his power from Satan,
MAT.12.25	Jesus knew their thoughts and replied, 
MAT.12.38	One day some teachers of religious law and Pharisees came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, we want you to show us a miraculous sign to prove your authority.”
MAT.12.39	But Jesus replied, 
MAT.12.46	As Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him. 
MAT.12.47	Someone told Jesus, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and they want to speak to you.”
MAT.12.48	Jesus asked, 
MAT.12.49	Then he pointed to his disciples and said, 
MAT.13.1	Later that same day Jesus left the house and sat beside the lake. 
MAT.13.2	A large crowd soon gathered around him, so he got into a boat. Then he sat there and taught as the people stood on the shore. 
MAT.13.3	He told many stories in the form of parables, such as this one:
MAT.13.10	His disciples came and asked him, “Why do you use parables when you talk to the people?”
MAT.13.11	He replied, 
MAT.13.24	Here is another story Jesus told: 
MAT.13.31	Here is another illustration Jesus used: 
MAT.13.33	Jesus also used this illustration: 
MAT.13.34	Jesus always used stories and illustrations like these when speaking to the crowds. In fact, he never spoke to them without using such parables. 
MAT.13.35	This fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet:
MAT.13.35	“I will speak to you in parables.
MAT.13.35	I will explain things hidden since the creation of the world.
MAT.13.36	Then, leaving the crowds outside, Jesus went into the house. His disciples said, “Please explain to us the story of the weeds in the field.”
MAT.13.37	Jesus replied, 
MAT.13.51	“Yes,” they said, “we do.”
MAT.13.52	Then he added, 
MAT.13.53	When Jesus had finished telling these stories and illustrations, he left that part of the country. 
MAT.13.54	He returned to Nazareth, his hometown. When he taught there in the synagogue, everyone was amazed and said, “Where does he get this wisdom and the power to do miracles?” 
MAT.13.55	Then they scoffed, “He’s just the carpenter’s son, and we know Mary, his mother, and his brothers—James, Joseph,
MAT.13.56	All his sisters live right here among us. Where did he learn all these things?” 
MAT.13.57	And they were deeply offended and refused to believe in him.
MAT.13.57	Then Jesus told them, 
MAT.13.58	And so he did only a few miracles there because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.1	When Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee,
MAT.14.2	he said to his advisers, “This must be John the Baptist raised from the dead! That is why he can do such miracles.”
MAT.14.3	For Herod had arrested and imprisoned John as a favor to his wife Herodias (the former wife of Herod’s brother Philip). 
MAT.14.4	John had been telling Herod, “It is against God’s law for you to marry her.” 
MAT.14.5	Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of a riot, because all the people believed John was a prophet.
MAT.14.6	But at a birthday party for Herod, Herodias’s daughter performed a dance that greatly pleased him, 
MAT.14.7	so he promised with a vow to give her anything she wanted. 
MAT.14.8	At her mother’s urging, the girl said, “I want the head of John the Baptist on a tray!” 
MAT.14.9	Then the king regretted what he had said; but because of the vow he had made in front of his guests, he issued the necessary orders. 
MAT.14.10	So John was beheaded in the prison, 
MAT.14.11	and his head was brought on a tray and given to the girl, who took it to her mother. 
MAT.14.12	Later, John’s disciples came for his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened.
MAT.14.13	As soon as Jesus heard the news, he left in a boat to a remote area to be alone. But the crowds heard where he was headed and followed on foot from many towns. 
MAT.14.14	Jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
MAT.14.15	That evening the disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and it’s already getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves.”
MAT.14.16	But Jesus said, 
MAT.14.17	“But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish!” they answered.
MAT.14.18	 he said. 
MAT.14.19	Then he told the people to sit down on the grass. Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he gave the bread to the disciples, who distributed it to the people. 
MAT.14.20	They all ate as much as they wanted, and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftovers. 
MAT.14.21	About 5,000 men were fed that day, in addition to all the women and children!
MAT.14.22	Immediately after this, Jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and cross to the other side of the lake, while he sent the people home. 
MAT.14.23	After sending them home, he went up into the hills by himself to pray. Night fell while he was there alone.
MAT.14.24	Meanwhile, the disciples were in trouble far away from land, for a strong wind had risen, and they were fighting heavy waves. 
MAT.14.25	About three o’clock in the morning
MAT.14.26	When the disciples saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. In their fear, they cried out, “It’s a ghost!”
MAT.14.27	But Jesus spoke to them at once. 
MAT.14.28	Then Peter called to him, “Lord, if it’s really you, tell me to come to you, walking on the water.”
MAT.14.29	 Jesus said.
MAT.14.29	So Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	But when he saw the strong
MAT.14.31	Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him. 
MAT.14.32	When they climbed back into the boat, the wind stopped. 
MAT.14.33	Then the disciples worshiped him. “You really are the Son of God!” they exclaimed.
MAT.14.34	After they had crossed the lake, they landed at Gennesaret. 
MAT.14.35	When the people recognized Jesus, the news of his arrival spread quickly throughout the whole area, and soon people were bringing all their sick to be healed. 
MAT.14.36	They begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe, and all who touched him were healed.
MAT.15.1	Some Pharisees and teachers of religious law now arrived from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked him, 
MAT.15.2	“Why do your disciples disobey our age-old tradition? For they ignore our tradition of ceremonial hand washing before they eat.”
MAT.15.3	Jesus replied, 
MAT.15.10	Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. 
MAT.15.12	Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you realize you offended the Pharisees by what you just said?”
MAT.15.13	Jesus replied, 
MAT.15.15	Then Peter said to Jesus, “Explain to us the parable that says people aren’t defiled by what they eat.”
MAT.15.16	 Jesus asked. 
MAT.15.21	Then Jesus left Galilee and went north to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 
MAT.15.22	A Gentile
MAT.15.23	But Jesus gave her no reply, not even a word. Then his disciples urged him to send her away. “Tell her to go away,” they said. “She is bothering us with all her begging.”
MAT.15.24	Then Jesus said to the woman, 
MAT.15.25	But she came and worshiped him, pleading again, “Lord, help me!”
MAT.15.26	Jesus responded, 
MAT.15.27	She replied, “That’s true, Lord, but even dogs are allowed to eat the scraps that fall beneath their masters’ table.”
MAT.15.28	 Jesus said to her, 
MAT.15.29	Jesus returned to the Sea of Galilee and climbed a hill and sat down. 
MAT.15.30	A vast crowd brought to him people who were lame, blind, crippled, those who couldn’t speak, and many others. They laid them before Jesus, and he healed them all. 
MAT.15.31	The crowd was amazed! Those who hadn’t been able to speak were talking, the crippled were made well, the lame were walking, and the blind could see again! And they praised the God of Israel.
MAT.15.32	Then Jesus called his disciples and told them, 
MAT.15.33	The disciples replied, “Where would we get enough food here in the wilderness for such a huge crowd?”
MAT.15.34	Jesus asked, 
MAT.15.34	They replied, “Seven loaves, and a few small fish.”
MAT.15.35	So Jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground. 
MAT.15.36	Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, thanked God for them, and broke them into pieces. He gave them to the disciples, who distributed the food to the crowd.
MAT.15.37	They all ate as much as they wanted. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food. 
MAT.15.38	There were 4,000 men who were fed that day, in addition to all the women and children. 
MAT.15.39	Then Jesus sent the people home, and he got into a boat and crossed over to the region of Magadan.
MAT.16.1	One day the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, demanding that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.
MAT.16.2	He replied, 
MAT.16.4	 Then Jesus left them and went away.
MAT.16.5	Later, after they crossed to the other side of the lake, the disciples discovered they had forgotten to bring any bread. 
MAT.16.6	 Jesus warned them. 
MAT.16.7	At this they began to argue with each other because they hadn’t brought any bread. 
MAT.16.8	Jesus knew what they were saying, so he said, 
MAT.16.12	Then at last they understood that he wasn’t speaking about the yeast in bread, but about the deceptive teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, 
MAT.16.14	“Well,” they replied, “some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say Jeremiah or one of the other prophets.”
MAT.16.15	Then he asked them, 
MAT.16.16	Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah,
MAT.16.17	Jesus replied, 
MAT.16.20	Then he sternly warned the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
MAT.16.21	From then on Jesus
MAT.16.22	But Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him
MAT.16.23	Jesus turned to Peter and said, 
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said to his disciples, 
MAT.17.1	Six days later Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, James and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone. 
MAT.17.2	As the men watched, Jesus’ appearance was transformed so that his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light. 
MAT.17.3	Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and began talking with Jesus.
MAT.17.4	Peter exclaimed, “Lord, it’s wonderful for us to be here! If you want, I’ll make three shelters as memorials
MAT.17.5	But even as he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy. Listen to him.” 
MAT.17.6	The disciples were terrified and fell face down on the ground.
MAT.17.7	Then Jesus came over and touched them. 
MAT.17.8	And when they looked up, Moses and Elijah were gone, and they saw only Jesus.
MAT.17.9	As they went back down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, 
MAT.17.10	Then his disciples asked him, “Why do the teachers of religious law insist that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes?
MAT.17.11	Jesus replied, 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples realized he was talking about John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	At the foot of the mountain, a large crowd was waiting for them. A man came and knelt before Jesus and said, 
MAT.17.15	“Lord, have mercy on my son. He has seizures and suffers terribly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. 
MAT.17.16	So I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn’t heal him.”
MAT.17.17	Jesus said, 
MAT.17.18	Then Jesus rebuked the demon in the boy, and it left him. From that moment the boy was well.
MAT.17.19	Afterward the disciples asked Jesus privately, “Why couldn’t we cast out that demon?”
MAT.17.20	 Jesus told them. 
MAT.17.22	After they gathered again in Galilee, Jesus told them, 
MAT.17.23	 And the disciples were filled with grief.
MAT.17.24	On their arrival in Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple tax
MAT.17.25	“Yes, he does,” Peter replied. Then he went into the house.
MAT.17.25	But before he had a chance to speak, Jesus asked him, 
MAT.17.26	“They tax the people they have conquered,” Peter replied.
MAT.17.26	 Jesus said, 
MAT.18.1	About that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?”
MAT.18.2	Jesus called a little child to him and put the child among them. 
MAT.18.3	Then he said, 
MAT.18.21	Then Peter came to him and asked, “Lord, how often should I forgive someone
MAT.18.22	 Jesus replied, 
MAT.19.1	When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went down to the region of Judea east of the Jordan River. 
MAT.19.2	Large crowds followed him there, and he healed their sick.
MAT.19.3	Some Pharisees came and tried to trap him with this question: “Should a man be allowed to divorce his wife for just any reason?”
MAT.19.4	 Jesus replied. 
MAT.19.5	And he said, 
MAT.19.7	“Then why did Moses say in the law that a man could give his wife a written notice of divorce and send her away?”
MAT.19.8	Jesus replied, 
MAT.19.10	Jesus’ disciples then said to him, “If this is the case, it is better not to marry!”
MAT.19.11	 Jesus said. 
MAT.19.13	One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him.
MAT.19.14	But Jesus said, 
MAT.19.15	And he placed his hands on their heads and blessed them before he left.
MAT.19.16	Someone came to Jesus with this question: “Teacher,
MAT.19.17	 Jesus replied. 
MAT.19.18	“Which ones?” the man asked.
MAT.19.18	And Jesus replied: 
MAT.19.20	“I’ve obeyed all these commandments,” the young man replied. “What else must I do?”
MAT.19.21	Jesus told him, 
MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had many possessions.
MAT.19.23	Then Jesus said to his disciples, 
MAT.19.25	The disciples were astounded. “Then who in the world can be saved?” they asked.
MAT.19.26	Jesus looked at them intently and said, 
MAT.19.27	Then Peter said to him, “We’ve given up everything to follow you. What will we get?”
MAT.19.28	Jesus replied, 
MAT.20.17	As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside privately and told them what was going to happen to him. 
MAT.20.18	 he said, 
MAT.20.20	Then the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus with her sons. She knelt respectfully to ask a favor. 
MAT.20.21	 he asked.
MAT.20.21	She replied, “In your Kingdom, please let my two sons sit in places of honor next to you, one on your right and the other on your left.”
MAT.20.22	But Jesus answered by saying to them, 
MAT.20.22	“Oh yes,” they replied, “we are able!”
MAT.20.23	Jesus told them, 
MAT.20.24	When the ten other disciples heard what James and John had asked, they were indignant. 
MAT.20.25	But Jesus called them together and said, 
MAT.20.29	As Jesus and the disciples left the town of Jericho, a large crowd followed behind. 
MAT.20.30	Two blind men were sitting beside the road. When they heard that Jesus was coming that way, they began shouting, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
MAT.20.31	“Be quiet!” the crowd yelled at them.
MAT.20.31	But they only shouted louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
MAT.20.32	When Jesus heard them, he stopped and called, 
MAT.20.33	“Lord,” they said, “we want to see!” 
MAT.20.34	Jesus felt sorry for them and touched their eyes. Instantly they could see! Then they followed him.
MAT.21.1	As Jesus and the disciples approached Jerusalem, they came to the town of Bethphage on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of them on ahead. 
MAT.21.2	 he said. 
MAT.21.4	This took place to fulfill the prophecy that said,
MAT.21.5	“Tell the people of Jerusalem,
MAT.21.5	‘Look, your King is coming to you.
MAT.21.5	He is humble, riding on a donkey—
MAT.21.5	riding on a donkey’s colt.’”
MAT.21.6	The two disciples did as Jesus commanded. 
MAT.21.7	They brought the donkey and the colt to him and threw their garments over the colt, and he sat on it.
MAT.21.8	Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 
MAT.21.9	Jesus was in the center of the procession, and the people all around him were shouting, 
MAT.21.9	“Praise God
MAT.21.9	Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the 
MAT.21.9	Praise God in highest heaven!”
MAT.21.10	The entire city of Jerusalem was in an uproar as he entered. “Who is this?” they asked.
MAT.21.11	And the crowds replied, “It’s Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”
MAT.21.12	Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out all the people buying and selling animals for sacrifice. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves. 
MAT.21.13	He said to them, 
MAT.21.14	The blind and the lame came to him in the Temple, and he healed them. 
MAT.21.15	The leading priests and the teachers of religious law saw these wonderful miracles and heard even the children in the Temple shouting, “Praise God for the Son of David.”
MAT.21.15	But the leaders were indignant. 
MAT.21.16	They asked Jesus, “Do you hear what these children are saying?”
MAT.21.16	 Jesus replied. 
MAT.21.17	Then he returned to Bethany, where he stayed overnight.
MAT.21.18	In the morning, as Jesus was returning to Jerusalem, he was hungry, 
MAT.21.19	and he noticed a fig tree beside the road. He went over to see if there were any figs, but there were only leaves. Then he said to it, 
MAT.21.20	The disciples were amazed when they saw this and asked, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”
MAT.21.21	Then Jesus told them, 
MAT.21.23	When Jesus returned to the Temple and began teaching, the leading priests and elders came up to him. They demanded, “By what authority are you doing all these things? Who gave you the right?”
MAT.21.24	 Jesus replied. 
MAT.21.25	They talked it over among themselves. “If we say it was from heaven, he will ask us why we didn’t believe John. 
MAT.21.26	But if we say it was merely human, we’ll be mobbed because the people believe John was a prophet.” 
MAT.21.27	So they finally replied, “We don’t know.”
MAT.21.27	And Jesus responded, 
MAT.21.31	They replied, “The first.”
MAT.21.31	Then Jesus explained his meaning: 
MAT.21.40	 Jesus asked, 
MAT.21.41	The religious leaders replied, “He will put the wicked men to a horrible death and lease the vineyard to others who will give him his share of the crop after each harvest.”
MAT.21.42	Then Jesus asked them, 
MAT.21.45	When the leading priests and Pharisees heard this parable, they realized he was telling the story against them—they were the wicked farmers. 
MAT.21.46	They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, who considered Jesus to be a prophet.
MAT.22.1	Jesus also told them other parables. He said, 
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees met together to plot how to trap Jesus into saying something for which he could be arrested. 
MAT.22.16	They sent some of their disciples, along with the supporters of Herod, to meet with him. “Teacher,” they said, “we know how honest you are. You teach the way of God truthfully. You are impartial and don’t play favorites. 
MAT.22.17	Now tell us what you think about this: Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
MAT.22.18	But Jesus knew their evil motives. 
MAT.22.19	 When they handed him a Roman coin,
MAT.22.20	he asked, 
MAT.22.21	“Caesar’s,” they replied.
MAT.22.21	 he said, 
MAT.22.22	His reply amazed them, and they went away.
MAT.22.23	That same day Jesus was approached by some Sadducees—religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead. They posed this question: 
MAT.22.24	“Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies without children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother’s name.’
MAT.22.25	Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children, so his brother married the widow. 
MAT.22.26	But the second brother also died, and the third brother married her. This continued with all seven of them. 
MAT.22.27	Last of all, the woman also died. 
MAT.22.28	So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her.”
MAT.22.29	Jesus replied, 
MAT.22.33	When the crowds heard him, they were astounded at his teaching.
MAT.22.34	But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees with his reply, they met together to question him again. 
MAT.22.35	One of them, an expert in religious law, tried to trap him with this question: 
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which is the most important commandment in the law of Moses?”
MAT.22.37	Jesus replied, 
MAT.22.41	Then, surrounded by the Pharisees, Jesus asked them a question: 
MAT.22.42	They replied, “He is the son of David.”
MAT.22.43	Jesus responded, 
MAT.22.46	No one could answer him. And after that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
MAT.23.1	Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 
MAT.24.1	As Jesus was leaving the Temple grounds, his disciples pointed out to him the various Temple buildings. 
MAT.24.2	But he responded, 
MAT.24.3	Later, Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives. His disciples came to him privately and said, “Tell us, when will all this happen? What sign will signal your return and the end of the world?
MAT.24.4	Jesus told them, 
MAT.24.15	 (Reader, pay attention!) 
MAT.26.1	When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, 
MAT.26.3	At that same time the leading priests and elders were meeting at the residence of Caiaphas, the high priest, 
MAT.26.4	plotting how to capture Jesus secretly and kill him. 
MAT.26.5	“But not during the Passover celebration,” they agreed, “or the people may riot.”
MAT.26.6	Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon, a man who had previously had leprosy. 
MAT.26.7	While he was eating,
MAT.26.8	The disciples were indignant when they saw this. “What a waste!” they said. 
MAT.26.9	“It could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor.”
MAT.26.10	But Jesus, aware of this, replied, 
MAT.26.14	Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the leading priests 
MAT.26.15	and asked, “How much will you pay me to betray Jesus to you?” And they gave him thirty pieces of silver. 
MAT.26.16	From that time on, Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus.
MAT.26.17	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?”
MAT.26.18	 he told them, 
MAT.26.19	So the disciples did as Jesus told them and prepared the Passover meal there.
MAT.26.20	When it was evening, Jesus sat down at the table
MAT.26.21	While they were eating, he said, 
MAT.26.22	Greatly distressed, each one asked in turn, “Am I the one, Lord?”
MAT.26.23	He replied, 
MAT.26.25	Judas, the one who would betray him, also asked, “Rabbi, am I the one?”
MAT.26.25	And Jesus told him, 
MAT.26.26	As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, 
MAT.26.27	And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them and said, 
MAT.26.30	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	On the way, Jesus told them, 
MAT.26.33	Peter declared, “Even if everyone else deserts you, I will never desert you.”
MAT.26.34	Jesus replied, 
MAT.26.35	“No!” Peter insisted. “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the other disciples vowed the same.
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus went with them to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and he said, 
MAT.26.37	He took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons, James and John, and he became anguished and distressed. 
MAT.26.38	He told them, 
MAT.26.39	He went on a little farther and bowed with his face to the ground, praying, 
MAT.26.40	Then he returned to the disciples and found them asleep. He said to Peter, 
MAT.26.42	Then Jesus left them a second time and prayed, 
MAT.26.43	When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open.
MAT.26.44	So he went to pray a third time, saying the same things again. 
MAT.26.45	Then he came to the disciples and said, 
MAT.26.47	And even as Jesus said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the leading priests and elders of the people. 
MAT.26.48	The traitor, Judas, had given them a prearranged signal: “You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss.” 
MAT.26.49	So Judas came straight to Jesus. “Greetings, Rabbi!” he exclaimed and gave him the kiss.
MAT.26.50	Jesus said, 
MAT.26.50	Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him. 
MAT.26.51	But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest’s slave, slashing off his ear.
MAT.26.52	 Jesus told him. 
MAT.26.55	Then Jesus said to the crowd, 
MAT.26.56	 At that point, all the disciples deserted him and fled.
MAT.26.57	Then the people who had arrested Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of religious law and the elders had gathered. 
MAT.26.58	Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and came to the high priest’s courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards and waited to see how it would all end.
MAT.26.59	Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council
MAT.26.60	But even though they found many who agreed to give false witness, they could not use anyone’s testimony. Finally, two men came forward 
MAT.26.61	who declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”
MAT.26.62	Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Well, aren’t you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?” 
MAT.26.63	But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I demand in the name of the living God—tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”
MAT.26.64	Jesus replied, 
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said, “Blasphemy! Why do we need other witnesses? You have all heard his blasphemy. 
MAT.26.66	What is your verdict?”
MAT.26.66	“Guilty!” they shouted. “He deserves to die!”
MAT.26.67	Then they began to spit in Jesus’ face and beat him with their fists. And some slapped him, 
MAT.26.68	jeering, “Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you that time?”
MAT.26.69	Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came over and said to him, “You were one of those with Jesus the Galilean.”
MAT.26.70	But Peter denied it in front of everyone. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.
MAT.26.71	Later, out by the gate, another servant girl noticed him and said to those standing around, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.
MAT.26.72	Again Peter denied it, this time with an oath. “I don’t even know the man,” he said.
MAT.26.73	A little later some of the other bystanders came over to Peter and said, “You must be one of them; we can tell by your Galilean accent.”
MAT.26.74	Peter swore, “A curse on me if I’m lying—I don’t know the man!” And immediately the rooster crowed.
MAT.26.75	Suddenly, Jesus’ words flashed through Peter’s mind: 
MAT.27.1	Very early in the morning the leading priests and the elders of the people met again to lay plans for putting Jesus to death. 
MAT.27.2	Then they bound him, led him away, and took him to Pilate, the Roman governor.
MAT.27.3	When Judas, who had betrayed him, realized that Jesus had been condemned to die, he was filled with remorse. So he took the thirty pieces of silver back to the leading priests and the elders. 
MAT.27.4	“I have sinned,” he declared, “for I have betrayed an innocent man.”
MAT.27.4	“What do we care?” they retorted. “That’s your problem.”
MAT.27.5	Then Judas threw the silver coins down in the Temple and went out and hanged himself.
MAT.27.6	The leading priests picked up the coins. “It wouldn’t be right to put this money in the Temple treasury,” they said, “since it was payment for murder.”
MAT.27.7	After some discussion they finally decided to buy the potter’s field, and they made it into a cemetery for foreigners. 
MAT.27.8	That is why the field is still called the Field of Blood. 
MAT.27.9	This fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah that says,
MAT.27.9	“They took
MAT.27.9	the price at which he was valued by the people of Israel,
MAT.27.10	and purchased the potter’s field,
MAT.27.10	as the 
MAT.27.11	Now Jesus was standing before Pilate, the Roman governor. “Are you the king of the Jews?” the governor asked him.
MAT.27.11	Jesus replied, 
MAT.27.12	But when the leading priests and the elders made their accusations against him, Jesus remained silent. 
MAT.27.13	“Don’t you hear all these charges they are bringing against you?” Pilate demanded. 
MAT.27.14	But Jesus made no response to any of the charges, much to the governor’s surprise.
MAT.27.15	Now it was the governor’s custom each year during the Passover celebration to release one prisoner to the crowd—anyone they wanted. 
MAT.27.16	This year there was a notorious prisoner, a man named Barabbas.
MAT.27.17	As the crowds gathered before Pilate’s house that morning, he asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you—Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?” 
MAT.27.18	(He knew very well that the religious leaders had arrested Jesus out of envy.)
MAT.27.19	Just then, as Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: “Leave that innocent man alone. I suffered through a terrible nightmare about him last night.”
MAT.27.20	Meanwhile, the leading priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be released and for Jesus to be put to death. 
MAT.27.21	So the governor asked again, “Which of these two do you want me to release to you?”
MAT.27.21	The crowd shouted back, “Barabbas!”
MAT.27.22	Pilate responded, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?”
MAT.27.22	They shouted back, “Crucify him!”
MAT.27.23	“Why?” Pilate demanded. “What crime has he committed?”
MAT.27.23	But the mob roared even louder, “Crucify him!”
MAT.27.24	Pilate saw that he wasn’t getting anywhere and that a riot was developing. So he sent for a bowl of water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood. The responsibility is yours!”
MAT.27.25	And all the people yelled back, “We will take responsibility for his death—we and our children!”
MAT.27.26	So Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip, then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.
MAT.27.27	Some of the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into their headquarters
MAT.27.28	They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. 
MAT.27.29	They wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head, and they placed a reed stick in his right hand as a scepter. Then they knelt before him in mockery and taunted, “Hail! King of the Jews!” 
MAT.27.30	And they spit on him and grabbed the stick and struck him on the head with it. 
MAT.27.31	When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified.
MAT.27.32	Along the way, they came across a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene,
MAT.27.33	And they went out to a place called Golgotha (which means “Place of the Skull”). 
MAT.27.34	The soldiers gave Jesus wine mixed with bitter gall, but when he had tasted it, he refused to drink it.
MAT.27.35	After they had nailed him to the cross, the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice.
MAT.27.36	Then they sat around and kept guard as he hung there. 
MAT.27.37	A sign was fastened above Jesus’ head, announcing the charge against him. It read: “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.” 
MAT.27.38	Two revolutionaries
MAT.27.39	The people passing by shouted abuse, shaking their heads in mockery. 
MAT.27.40	“Look at you now!” they yelled at him. “You said you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days. Well then, if you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross!”
MAT.27.41	The leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders also mocked Jesus. 
MAT.27.42	“He saved others,” they scoffed, “but he can’t save himself! So he is the King of Israel, is he? Let him come down from the cross right now, and we will believe in him! 
MAT.27.43	He trusted God, so let God rescue him now if he wants him! For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” 
MAT.27.44	Even the revolutionaries who were crucified with him ridiculed him in the same way.
MAT.27.45	At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o’clock. 
MAT.27.46	At about three o’clock, Jesus called out with a loud voice, 
MAT.27.47	Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah. 
MAT.27.48	One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink. 
MAT.27.49	But the rest said, “Wait! Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”
MAT.27.50	Then Jesus shouted out again, and he released his spirit. 
MAT.27.51	At that moment the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, rocks split apart, 
MAT.27.52	and tombs opened. The bodies of many godly men and women who had died were raised from the dead. 
MAT.27.53	They left the cemetery after Jesus’ resurrection, went into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people.
MAT.27.54	The Roman officer
MAT.27.55	And many women who had come from Galilee with Jesus to care for him were watching from a distance. 
MAT.27.56	Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James and Joseph), and the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee.
MAT.27.57	As evening approached, Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea who had become a follower of Jesus, 
MAT.27.58	went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. And Pilate issued an order to release it to him. 
MAT.27.59	Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a long sheet of clean linen cloth. 
MAT.27.60	He placed it in his own new tomb, which had been carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance and left. 
MAT.27.61	Both Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting across from the tomb and watching.
MAT.27.62	The next day, on the Sabbath,
MAT.27.63	They told him, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver once said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise from the dead.’ 
MAT.27.64	So we request that you seal the tomb until the third day. This will prevent his disciples from coming and stealing his body and then telling everyone he was raised from the dead! If that happens, we’ll be worse off than we were at first.”
MAT.27.65	Pilate replied, “Take guards and secure it the best you can.” 
MAT.27.66	So they sealed the tomb and posted guards to protect it.
MAT.28.1	Early on Sunday morning,
MAT.28.2	Suddenly there was a great earthquake! For an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, rolled aside the stone, and sat on it. 
MAT.28.3	His face shone like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow. 
MAT.28.4	The guards shook with fear when they saw him, and they fell into a dead faint.
MAT.28.5	Then the angel spoke to the women. “Don’t be afraid!” he said. “I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 
MAT.28.6	He isn’t here! He is risen from the dead, just as he said would happen. Come, see where his body was lying. 
MAT.28.7	And now, go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there. Remember what I have told you.”
MAT.28.8	The women ran quickly from the tomb. They were very frightened but also filled with great joy, and they rushed to give the disciples the angel’s message. 
MAT.28.9	And as they went, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they ran to him, grasped his feet, and worshiped him. 
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.28.11	As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the leading priests what had happened. 
MAT.28.12	A meeting with the elders was called, and they decided to give the soldiers a large bribe. 
MAT.28.13	They told the soldiers, “You must say, ‘Jesus’ disciples came during the night while we were sleeping, and they stole his body.’ 
MAT.28.14	If the governor hears about it, we’ll stand up for you so you won’t get in trouble.” 
MAT.28.15	So the guards accepted the bribe and said what they were told to say. Their story spread widely among the Jews, and they still tell it today.
MAT.28.16	Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee, going to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 
MAT.28.17	When they saw him, they worshiped him—but some of them doubted!
MAT.28.18	Jesus came and told his disciples, 
MRK.1.1	This is the Good News about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.
MRK.1.2	just as the prophet Isaiah had written:
MRK.1.2	“Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,
MRK.1.2	and he will prepare your way.
MRK.1.3	He is a voice shouting in the wilderness,
MRK.1.3	‘Prepare the way for the 
MRK.1.3	Clear the road for him!’
MRK.1.4	This messenger was John the Baptist. He was in the wilderness and preached that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven. 
MRK.1.5	All of Judea, including all the people of Jerusalem, went out to see and hear John. And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River. 
MRK.1.6	His clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey.
MRK.1.7	John announced: “Someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I’m not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals. 
MRK.1.8	I baptize you with
MRK.1.9	One day Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and John baptized him in the Jordan River. 
MRK.1.10	As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the heavens splitting apart and the Holy Spirit descending on him
MRK.1.11	And a voice from heaven said, “You are my dearly loved Son, and you bring me great joy.”
MRK.1.12	The Spirit then compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness, 
MRK.1.13	where he was tempted by Satan for forty days. He was out among the wild animals, and angels took care of him.
MRK.1.14	Later on, after John was arrested, Jesus went into Galilee, where he preached God’s Good News.
MRK.1.15	 he announced. 
MRK.1.16	One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon
MRK.1.17	Jesus called out to them, 
MRK.1.18	And they left their nets at once and followed him.
MRK.1.19	A little farther up the shore Jesus saw Zebedee’s sons, James and John, in a boat repairing their nets. 
MRK.1.20	He called them at once, and they also followed him, leaving their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired men.
MRK.1.21	Jesus and his companions went to the town of Capernaum. When the Sabbath day came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach. 
MRK.1.22	The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught with real authority—quite unlike the teachers of religious law.
MRK.1.23	Suddenly, a man in the synagogue who was possessed by an evil
MRK.1.24	“Why are you interfering with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
MRK.1.25	But Jesus reprimanded him. 
MRK.1.26	At that, the evil spirit screamed, threw the man into a convulsion, and then came out of him.
MRK.1.27	Amazement gripped the audience, and they began to discuss what had happened. “What sort of new teaching is this?” they asked excitedly. “It has such authority! Even evil spirits obey his orders!” 
MRK.1.28	The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout the entire region of Galilee.
MRK.1.29	After Jesus left the synagogue with James and John, they went to Simon and Andrew’s home. 
MRK.1.30	Now Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a high fever. They told Jesus about her right away. 
MRK.1.31	So he went to her bedside, took her by the hand, and helped her sit up. Then the fever left her, and she prepared a meal for them.
MRK.1.32	That evening after sunset, many sick and demon-possessed people were brought to Jesus. 
MRK.1.33	The whole town gathered at the door to watch. 
MRK.1.34	So Jesus healed many people who were sick with various diseases, and he cast out many demons. But because the demons knew who he was, he did not allow them to speak.
MRK.1.35	Before daybreak the next morning, Jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray. 
MRK.1.36	Later Simon and the others went out to find him. 
MRK.1.37	When they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you.”
MRK.1.38	But Jesus replied, 
MRK.1.39	So he traveled throughout the region of Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and casting out demons.
MRK.1.40	A man with leprosy came and knelt in front of Jesus, begging to be healed. “If you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean,” he said.
MRK.1.41	Moved with compassion,
MRK.1.42	Instantly the leprosy disappeared, and the man was healed. 
MRK.1.43	Then Jesus sent him on his way with a stern warning: 
MRK.1.45	But the man went and spread the word, proclaiming to everyone what had happened. As a result, large crowds soon surrounded Jesus, and he couldn’t publicly enter a town anywhere. He had to stay out in the secluded places, but people from everywhere kept coming to him.
MRK.2.1	When Jesus returned to Capernaum several days later, the news spread quickly that he was back home. 
MRK.2.2	Soon the house where he was staying was so packed with visitors that there was no more room, even outside the door. While he was preaching God’s word to them, 
MRK.2.3	four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. 
MRK.2.4	They couldn’t bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, so they dug a hole through the roof above his head. Then they lowered the man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus. 
MRK.2.5	Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, 
MRK.2.6	But some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there thought to themselves, 
MRK.2.7	“What is he saying? This is blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!”
MRK.2.8	Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking, so he asked them, 
MRK.2.10	 Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, 
MRK.2.12	And the man jumped up, grabbed his mat, and walked out through the stunned onlookers. They were all amazed and praised God, exclaiming, “We’ve never seen anything like this before!”
MRK.2.13	Then Jesus went out to the lakeshore again and taught the crowds that were coming to him. 
MRK.2.14	As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at his tax collector’s booth. 
MRK.2.15	Later, Levi invited Jesus and his disciples to his home as dinner guests, along with many tax collectors and other disreputable sinners. (There were many people of this kind among Jesus’ followers.) 
MRK.2.16	But when the teachers of religious law who were Pharisees
MRK.2.17	When Jesus heard this, he told them, 
MRK.2.18	Once when John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, some people came to Jesus and asked, “Why don’t your disciples fast like John’s disciples and the Pharisees do?”
MRK.2.19	Jesus replied, 
MRK.2.23	One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields, his disciples began breaking off heads of grain to eat. 
MRK.2.24	But the Pharisees said to Jesus, “Look, why are they breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?”
MRK.2.25	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.2.27	Then Jesus said to them, 
MRK.3.1	Jesus went into the synagogue again and noticed a man with a deformed hand. 
MRK.3.2	Since it was the Sabbath, Jesus’ enemies watched him closely. If he healed the man’s hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath.
MRK.3.3	Jesus said to the man with the deformed hand, 
MRK.3.4	Then he turned to his critics and asked, 
MRK.3.5	He looked around at them angrily and was deeply saddened by their hard hearts. Then he said to the man, 
MRK.3.6	At once the Pharisees went away and met with the supporters of Herod to plot how to kill Jesus.
MRK.3.7	Jesus went out to the lake with his disciples, and a large crowd followed him. They came from all over Galilee, Judea, 
MRK.3.8	Jerusalem, Idumea, from east of the Jordan River, and even from as far north as Tyre and Sidon. The news about his miracles had spread far and wide, and vast numbers of people came to see him.
MRK.3.9	Jesus instructed his disciples to have a boat ready so the crowd would not crush him. 
MRK.3.10	He had healed many people that day, so all the sick people eagerly pushed forward to touch him. 
MRK.3.11	And whenever those possessed by evil
MRK.3.12	But Jesus sternly commanded the spirits not to reveal who he was.
MRK.3.13	Afterward Jesus went up on a mountain and called out the ones he wanted to go with him. And they came to him. 
MRK.3.14	Then he appointed twelve of them and called them his apostles.
MRK.3.15	giving them authority to cast out demons. 
MRK.3.16	These are the twelve he chose:
MRK.3.16	Simon (whom he named Peter),
MRK.3.17	James and John (the sons of Zebedee, but Jesus nicknamed them “Sons of Thunder”
MRK.3.18	Andrew,
MRK.3.18	Philip,
MRK.3.18	Bartholomew,
MRK.3.18	Matthew,
MRK.3.18	Thomas,
MRK.3.18	James (son of Alphaeus),
MRK.3.18	Thaddaeus,
MRK.3.18	Simon (the zealot
MRK.3.19	Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).
MRK.3.20	One time Jesus entered a house, and the crowds began to gather again. Soon he and his disciples couldn’t even find time to eat. 
MRK.3.21	When his family heard what was happening, they tried to take him away. “He’s out of his mind,” they said.
MRK.3.22	But the teachers of religious law who had arrived from Jerusalem said, “He’s possessed by Satan,
MRK.3.23	Jesus called them over and responded with an illustration. 
MRK.3.30	He told them this because they were saying, “He’s possessed by an evil spirit.”
MRK.3.31	Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him. They stood outside and sent word for him to come out and talk with them. 
MRK.3.32	There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and someone said, “Your mother and your brothers
MRK.3.33	Jesus replied, 
MRK.3.34	Then he looked at those around him and said, 
MRK.4.1	Once again Jesus began teaching by the lakeshore. A very large crowd soon gathered around him, so he got into a boat. Then he sat in the boat while all the people remained on the shore. 
MRK.4.2	He taught them by telling many stories in the form of parables, such as this one:
MRK.4.9	Then he said, 
MRK.4.10	Later, when Jesus was alone with the twelve disciples and with the others who were gathered around, they asked him what the parables meant.
MRK.4.11	He replied, 
MRK.4.13	Then Jesus said to them, 
MRK.4.21	Then Jesus asked them, 
MRK.4.24	Then he added, 
MRK.4.26	Jesus also said, 
MRK.4.30	Jesus said, 
MRK.4.33	Jesus used many similar stories and illustrations to teach the people as much as they could understand. 
MRK.4.34	In fact, in his public ministry he never taught without using parables; but afterward, when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them.
MRK.4.35	As evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, 
MRK.4.36	So they took Jesus in the boat and started out, leaving the crowds behind (although other boats followed). 
MRK.4.37	But soon a fierce storm came up. High waves were breaking into the boat, and it began to fill with water.
MRK.4.38	Jesus was sleeping at the back of the boat with his head on a cushion. The disciples woke him up, shouting, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re going to drown?”
MRK.4.39	When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and said to the waves, 
MRK.4.40	Then he asked them, 
MRK.4.41	The disciples were absolutely terrified. “Who is this man?” they asked each other. “Even the wind and waves obey him!”
MRK.5.1	So they arrived at the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gerasenes.
MRK.5.2	When Jesus climbed out of the boat, a man possessed by an evil
MRK.5.3	This man lived in the burial caves and could no longer be restrained, even with a chain. 
MRK.5.4	Whenever he was put into chains and shackles—as he often was—he snapped the chains from his wrists and smashed the shackles. No one was strong enough to subdue him. 
MRK.5.5	Day and night he wandered among the burial caves and in the hills, howling and cutting himself with sharp stones.
MRK.5.6	When Jesus was still some distance away, the man saw him, ran to meet him, and bowed low before him. 
MRK.5.7	With a shriek, he screamed, “Why are you interfering with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In the name of God, I beg you, don’t torture me!” 
MRK.5.8	For Jesus had already said to the spirit, 
MRK.5.9	Then Jesus demanded, 
MRK.5.9	And he replied, “My name is Legion, because there are many of us inside this man.” 
MRK.5.10	Then the evil spirits begged him again and again not to send them to some distant place.
MRK.5.11	There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby. 
MRK.5.12	“Send us into those pigs,” the spirits begged. “Let us enter them.”
MRK.5.13	So Jesus gave them permission. The evil spirits came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the entire herd of about 2,000 pigs plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water.
MRK.5.14	The herdsmen fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside, spreading the news as they ran. People rushed out to see what had happened. 
MRK.5.15	A crowd soon gathered around Jesus, and they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons. He was sitting there fully clothed and perfectly sane, and they were all afraid. 
MRK.5.16	Then those who had seen what happened told the others about the demon-possessed man and the pigs. 
MRK.5.17	And the crowd began pleading with Jesus to go away and leave them alone.
MRK.5.18	As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon possessed begged to go with him. 
MRK.5.19	But Jesus said, 
MRK.5.20	So the man started off to visit the Ten Towns
MRK.5.21	Jesus got into the boat again and went back to the other side of the lake, where a large crowd gathered around him on the shore. 
MRK.5.22	Then a leader of the local synagogue, whose name was Jairus, arrived. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet, 
MRK.5.23	pleading fervently with him. “My little daughter is dying,” he said. “Please come and lay your hands on her; heal her so she can live.”
MRK.5.24	Jesus went with him, and all the people followed, crowding around him. 
MRK.5.25	A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding. 
MRK.5.26	She had suffered a great deal from many doctors, and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them, but she had gotten no better. In fact, she had gotten worse. 
MRK.5.27	She had heard about Jesus, so she came up behind him through the crowd and touched his robe. 
MRK.5.28	For she thought to herself, “If I can just touch his robe, I will be healed.” 
MRK.5.29	Immediately the bleeding stopped, and she could feel in her body that she had been healed of her terrible condition.
MRK.5.30	Jesus realized at once that healing power had gone out from him, so he turned around in the crowd and asked, 
MRK.5.31	His disciples said to him, “Look at this crowd pressing around you. How can you ask, ‘Who touched me?’”
MRK.5.32	But he kept on looking around to see who had done it. 
MRK.5.33	Then the frightened woman, trembling at the realization of what had happened to her, came and fell to her knees in front of him and told him what she had done. 
MRK.5.34	And he said to her, 
MRK.5.35	While he was still speaking to her, messengers arrived from the home of Jairus, the leader of the synagogue. They told him, “Your daughter is dead. There’s no use troubling the Teacher now.”
MRK.5.36	But Jesus overheard
MRK.5.37	Then Jesus stopped the crowd and wouldn’t let anyone go with him except Peter, James, and John (the brother of James). 
MRK.5.38	When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw much commotion and weeping and wailing. 
MRK.5.39	He went inside and asked, 
MRK.5.40	The crowd laughed at him. But he made them all leave, and he took the girl’s father and mother and his three disciples into the room where the girl was lying. 
MRK.5.41	Holding her hand, he said to her, 
MRK.5.42	And the girl, who was twelve years old, immediately stood up and walked around! They were overwhelmed and totally amazed. 
MRK.5.43	Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened, and then he told them to give her something to eat.
MRK.6.1	Jesus left that part of the country and returned with his disciples to Nazareth, his hometown. 
MRK.6.2	The next Sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. They asked, “Where did he get all this wisdom and the power to perform such miracles?” 
MRK.6.3	Then they scoffed, “He’s just a carpenter, the son of Mary
MRK.6.4	Then Jesus told them, 
MRK.6.5	And because of their unbelief, he couldn’t do any miracles among them except to place his hands on a few sick people and heal them. 
MRK.6.6	And he was amazed at their unbelief.
MRK.6.6	Then Jesus went from village to village, teaching the people. 
MRK.6.7	And he called his twelve disciples together and began sending them out two by two, giving them authority to cast out evil
MRK.6.8	He told them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick—no food, no traveler’s bag, no money.
MRK.6.9	He allowed them to wear sandals but not to take a change of clothes.
MRK.6.10	 he said, 
MRK.6.12	So the disciples went out, telling everyone they met to repent of their sins and turn to God. 
MRK.6.13	And they cast out many demons and healed many sick people, anointing them with olive oil.
MRK.6.14	Herod Antipas, the king, soon heard about Jesus, because everyone was talking about him. Some were saying,
MRK.6.15	Others said, “He’s the prophet Elijah.” Still others said, “He’s a prophet like the other great prophets of the past.”
MRK.6.16	When Herod heard about Jesus, he said, “John, the man I beheaded, has come back from the dead.”
MRK.6.17	For Herod had sent soldiers to arrest and imprison John as a favor to Herodias. She had been his brother Philip’s wife, but Herod had married her. 
MRK.6.18	John had been telling Herod, “It is against God’s law for you to marry your brother’s wife.” 
MRK.6.19	So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But without Herod’s approval she was powerless, 
MRK.6.20	for Herod respected John; and knowing that he was a good and holy man, he protected him. Herod was greatly disturbed whenever he talked with John, but even so, he liked to listen to him.
MRK.6.21	Herodias’s chance finally came on Herod’s birthday. He gave a party for his high government officials, army officers, and the leading citizens of Galilee. 
MRK.6.22	Then his daughter, also named Herodias,
MRK.6.23	He even vowed, “I will give you whatever you ask, up to half my kingdom!”
MRK.6.24	She went out and asked her mother, “What should I ask for?”
MRK.6.24	Her mother told her, “Ask for the head of John the Baptist!”
MRK.6.25	So the girl hurried back to the king and told him, “I want the head of John the Baptist, right now, on a tray!”
MRK.6.26	Then the king deeply regretted what he had said; but because of the vows he had made in front of his guests, he couldn’t refuse her. 
MRK.6.27	So he immediately sent an executioner to the prison to cut off John’s head and bring it to him. The soldier beheaded John in the prison, 
MRK.6.28	brought his head on a tray, and gave it to the girl, who took it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	When John’s disciples heard what had happened, they came to get his body and buried it in a tomb.
MRK.6.30	The apostles returned to Jesus from their ministry tour and told him all they had done and taught. 
MRK.6.31	Then Jesus said, 
MRK.6.32	So they left by boat for a quiet place, where they could be alone. 
MRK.6.33	But many people recognized them and saw them leaving, and people from many towns ran ahead along the shore and got there ahead of them. 
MRK.6.34	Jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat, and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
MRK.6.35	Late in the afternoon his disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and it’s already getting late. 
MRK.6.36	Send the crowds away so they can go to the nearby farms and villages and buy something to eat.”
MRK.6.37	But Jesus said, 
MRK.6.37	“With what?” they asked. “We’d have to work for months to earn enough money
MRK.6.38	 he asked. 
MRK.6.38	They came back and reported, “We have five loaves of bread and two fish.”
MRK.6.39	Then Jesus told the disciples to have the people sit down in groups on the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	So they sat down in groups of fifty or a hundred.
MRK.6.41	Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he kept giving the bread to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people. He also divided the fish for everyone to share. 
MRK.6.42	They all ate as much as they wanted, 
MRK.6.43	and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftover bread and fish. 
MRK.6.44	A total of 5,000 men and their families were fed.
MRK.6.45	Immediately after this, Jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and head across the lake to Bethsaida, while he sent the people home. 
MRK.6.46	After telling everyone good-bye, he went up into the hills by himself to pray.
MRK.6.47	Late that night, the disciples were in their boat in the middle of the lake, and Jesus was alone on land. 
MRK.6.48	He saw that they were in serious trouble, rowing hard and struggling against the wind and waves. About three o’clock in the morning
MRK.6.49	but when they saw him walking on the water, they cried out in terror, thinking he was a ghost. 
MRK.6.50	They were all terrified when they saw him.
MRK.6.50	But Jesus spoke to them at once. 
MRK.6.51	Then he climbed into the boat, and the wind stopped. They were totally amazed, 
MRK.6.52	for they still didn’t understand the significance of the miracle of the loaves. Their hearts were too hard to take it in.
MRK.6.53	After they had crossed the lake, they landed at Gennesaret. They brought the boat to shore 
MRK.6.54	and climbed out. The people recognized Jesus at once, 
MRK.6.55	and they ran throughout the whole area, carrying sick people on mats to wherever they heard he was. 
MRK.6.56	Wherever he went—in villages, cities, or the countryside—they brought the sick out to the marketplaces. They begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe, and all who touched him were healed.
MRK.7.1	One day some Pharisees and teachers of religious law arrived from Jerusalem to see Jesus. 
MRK.7.2	They noticed that some of his disciples failed to follow the Jewish ritual of hand washing before eating. 
MRK.7.3	(The Jews, especially the Pharisees, do not eat until they have poured water over their cupped hands,
MRK.7.4	Similarly, they don’t eat anything from the market until they immerse their hands
MRK.7.5	So the Pharisees and teachers of religious law asked him, “Why don’t your disciples follow our age-old tradition? They eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony.”
MRK.7.6	Jesus replied, 
MRK.7.9	Then he said, 
MRK.7.14	Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. 
MRK.7.17	Then Jesus went into a house to get away from the crowd, and his disciples asked him what he meant by the parable he had just used. 
MRK.7.18	 he asked. 
MRK.7.19	 (By saying this, he declared that every kind of food is acceptable in God’s eyes.)
MRK.7.20	And then he added, 
MRK.7.24	Then Jesus left Galilee and went north to the region of Tyre.
MRK.7.25	Right away a woman who had heard about him came and fell at his feet. Her little girl was possessed by an evil
MRK.7.26	and she begged him to cast out the demon from her daughter.
MRK.7.26	Since she was a Gentile, born in Syrian Phoenicia, 
MRK.7.27	Jesus told her, 
MRK.7.28	She replied, “That’s true, Lord, but even the dogs under the table are allowed to eat the scraps from the children’s plates.”
MRK.7.29	 he said. 
MRK.7.30	And when she arrived home, she found her little girl lying quietly in bed, and the demon was gone.
MRK.7.31	Jesus left Tyre and went up to Sidon before going back to the Sea of Galilee and the region of the Ten Towns.
MRK.7.32	A deaf man with a speech impediment was brought to him, and the people begged Jesus to lay his hands on the man to heal him.
MRK.7.33	Jesus led him away from the crowd so they could be alone. He put his fingers into the man’s ears. Then, spitting on his own fingers, he touched the man’s tongue. 
MRK.7.34	Looking up to heaven, he sighed and said, 
MRK.7.35	Instantly the man could hear perfectly, and his tongue was freed so he could speak plainly!
MRK.7.36	Jesus told the crowd not to tell anyone, but the more he told them not to, the more they spread the news. 
MRK.7.37	They were completely amazed and said again and again, “Everything he does is wonderful. He even makes the deaf to hear and gives speech to those who cannot speak.”
MRK.8.1	About this time another large crowd had gathered, and the people ran out of food again. Jesus called his disciples and told them, 
MRK.8.4	His disciples replied, “How are we supposed to find enough food to feed them out here in the wilderness?”
MRK.8.5	Jesus asked, 
MRK.8.5	“Seven loaves,” they replied.
MRK.8.6	So Jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, thanked God for them, and broke them into pieces. He gave them to his disciples, who distributed the bread to the crowd. 
MRK.8.7	A few small fish were found, too, so Jesus also blessed these and told the disciples to distribute them.
MRK.8.8	They ate as much as they wanted. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food. 
MRK.8.9	There were about 4,000 men in the crowd that day, and Jesus sent them home after they had eaten. 
MRK.8.10	Immediately after this, he got into a boat with his disciples and crossed over to the region of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had arrived, they came and started to argue with him. Testing him, they demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.
MRK.8.12	When he heard this, he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, 
MRK.8.13	So he got back into the boat and left them, and he crossed to the other side of the lake.
MRK.8.14	But the disciples had forgotten to bring any food. They had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat. 
MRK.8.15	As they were crossing the lake, Jesus warned them, 
MRK.8.16	At this they began to argue with each other because they hadn’t brought any bread. 
MRK.8.17	Jesus knew what they were saying, so he said, 
MRK.8.19	“Twelve,” they said.
MRK.8.20	“Seven,” they said.
MRK.8.21	 he asked them.
MRK.8.22	When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and they begged him to touch the man and heal him. 
MRK.8.23	Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then, spitting on the man’s eyes, he laid his hands on him and asked, 
MRK.8.24	The man looked around. “Yes,” he said, “I see people, but I can’t see them very clearly. They look like trees walking around.”
MRK.8.25	Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again, and his eyes were opened. His sight was completely restored, and he could see everything clearly. 
MRK.8.26	Jesus sent him away, saying, 
MRK.8.27	Jesus and his disciples left Galilee and went up to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along, he asked them, 
MRK.8.28	“Well,” they replied, “some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other prophets.”
MRK.8.29	Then he asked them, 
MRK.8.29	Peter replied, “You are the Messiah.
MRK.8.30	But Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
MRK.8.31	Then Jesus began to tell them that the Son of Man
MRK.8.32	As he talked about this openly with his disciples, Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him for saying such things.
MRK.8.33	Jesus turned around and looked at his disciples, then reprimanded Peter. 
MRK.8.34	Then, calling the crowd to join his disciples, he said, 
MRK.9.1	Jesus went on to say, 
MRK.9.2	Six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone. As the men watched, Jesus’ appearance was transformed, 
MRK.9.3	and his clothes became dazzling white, far whiter than any earthly bleach could ever make them. 
MRK.9.4	Then Elijah and Moses appeared and began talking with Jesus.
MRK.9.5	Peter exclaimed, “Rabbi, it’s wonderful for us to be here! Let’s make three shelters as memorials
MRK.9.6	He said this because he didn’t really know what else to say, for they were all terrified.
MRK.9.7	Then a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my dearly loved Son. Listen to him.” 
MRK.9.8	Suddenly, when they looked around, Moses and Elijah were gone, and they saw only Jesus with them.
MRK.9.9	As they went back down the mountain, he told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man
MRK.9.10	So they kept it to themselves, but they often asked each other what he meant by “rising from the dead.”
MRK.9.11	Then they asked him, “Why do the teachers of religious law insist that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes?
MRK.9.12	Jesus responded, 
MRK.9.14	When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd surrounding them, and some teachers of religious law were arguing with them. 
MRK.9.15	When the crowd saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with awe, and they ran to greet him.
MRK.9.16	 Jesus asked.
MRK.9.17	One of the men in the crowd spoke up and said, “Teacher, I brought my son so you could heal him. He is possessed by an evil spirit that won’t let him talk. 
MRK.9.18	And whenever this spirit seizes him, it throws him violently to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid.
MRK.9.19	Jesus said to them,
MRK.9.20	So they brought the boy. But when the evil spirit saw Jesus, it threw the child into a violent convulsion, and he fell to the ground, writhing and foaming at the mouth.
MRK.9.21	 Jesus asked the boy’s father.
MRK.9.21	He replied, “Since he was a little boy. 
MRK.9.22	The spirit often throws him into the fire or into water, trying to kill him. Have mercy on us and help us, if you can.”
MRK.9.23	 Jesus asked. 
MRK.9.24	The father instantly cried out, “I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief!”
MRK.9.25	When Jesus saw that the crowd of onlookers was growing, he rebuked the evil
MRK.9.26	Then the spirit screamed and threw the boy into another violent convulsion and left him. The boy appeared to be dead. A murmur ran through the crowd as people said, “He’s dead.” 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.
MRK.9.28	Afterward, when Jesus was alone in the house with his disciples, they asked him, “Why couldn’t we cast out that evil spirit?”
MRK.9.29	Jesus replied, 
MRK.9.30	Leaving that region, they traveled through Galilee. Jesus didn’t want anyone to know he was there, 
MRK.9.31	for he wanted to spend more time with his disciples and teach them. He said to them, 
MRK.9.32	They didn’t understand what he was saying, however, and they were afraid to ask him what he meant.
MRK.9.33	After they arrived at Capernaum and settled in a house, Jesus asked his disciples, 
MRK.9.34	But they didn’t answer, because they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. 
MRK.9.35	He sat down, called the twelve disciples over to him, and said, 
MRK.9.36	Then he put a little child among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, 
MRK.9.38	John said to Jesus, “Teacher, we saw someone using your name to cast out demons, but we told him to stop because he wasn’t in our group.”
MRK.9.39	 Jesus said. 
MRK.10.1	Then Jesus left Capernaum and went down to the region of Judea and into the area east of the Jordan River. Once again crowds gathered around him, and as usual he was teaching them.
MRK.10.2	Some Pharisees came and tried to trap him with this question: “Should a man be allowed to divorce his wife?”
MRK.10.3	Jesus answered them with a question: 
MRK.10.4	“Well, he permitted it,” they replied. “He said a man can give his wife a written notice of divorce and send her away.”
MRK.10.5	But Jesus responded, 
MRK.10.10	Later, when he was alone with his disciples in the house, they brought up the subject again. 
MRK.10.11	He told them, 
MRK.10.13	One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could touch and bless them. But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him.
MRK.10.14	When Jesus saw what was happening, he was angry with his disciples. He said to them, 
MRK.10.16	Then he took the children in his arms and placed his hands on their heads and blessed them.
MRK.10.17	As Jesus was starting out on his way to Jerusalem, a man came running up to him, knelt down, and asked, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
MRK.10.18	 Jesus asked. 
MRK.10.20	“Teacher,” the man replied, “I’ve obeyed all these commandments since I was young.”
MRK.10.21	Looking at the man, Jesus felt genuine love for him. 
MRK.10.22	At this the man’s face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.
MRK.10.23	Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, 
MRK.10.24	This amazed them. But Jesus said again, 
MRK.10.26	The disciples were astounded. “Then who in the world can be saved?” they asked.
MRK.10.27	Jesus looked at them intently and said, 
MRK.10.28	Then Peter began to speak up. “We’ve given up everything to follow you,” he said.
MRK.10.29	 Jesus replied, 
MRK.10.32	They were now on the way up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were filled with awe, and the people following behind were overwhelmed with fear. Taking the twelve disciples aside, Jesus once more began to describe everything that was about to happen to him. 
MRK.10.33	 he said, 
MRK.10.35	Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came over and spoke to him. “Teacher,” they said, “we want you to do us a favor.”
MRK.10.36	 he asked.
MRK.10.37	They replied, “When you sit on your glorious throne, we want to sit in places of honor next to you, one on your right and the other on your left.”
MRK.10.38	But Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.39	“Oh yes,” they replied, “we are able!”
MRK.10.39	Then Jesus told them, 
MRK.10.41	When the ten other disciples heard what James and John had asked, they were indignant. 
MRK.10.42	So Jesus called them together and said, 
MRK.10.46	Then they reached Jericho, and as Jesus and his disciples left town, a large crowd followed him. A blind beggar named Bartimaeus (son of Timaeus) was sitting beside the road. 
MRK.10.47	When Bartimaeus heard that Jesus of Nazareth was nearby, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
MRK.10.48	“Be quiet!” many of the people yelled at him.
MRK.10.48	But he only shouted louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
MRK.10.49	When Jesus heard him, he stopped and said, 
MRK.10.49	So they called the blind man. “Cheer up,” they said. “Come on, he’s calling you!” 
MRK.10.50	Bartimaeus threw aside his coat, jumped up, and came to Jesus.
MRK.10.51	 Jesus asked.
MRK.10.51	“My Rabbi,
MRK.10.52	And Jesus said to him, 
MRK.11.1	As Jesus and his disciples approached Jerusalem, they came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of them on ahead. 
MRK.11.2	 he told them. 
MRK.11.4	The two disciples left and found the colt standing in the street, tied outside the front door. 
MRK.11.5	As they were untying it, some bystanders demanded, “What are you doing, untying that colt?” 
MRK.11.6	They said what Jesus had told them to say, and they were permitted to take it. 
MRK.11.7	Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments over it, and he sat on it.
MRK.11.8	Many in the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him, and others spread leafy branches they had cut in the fields. 
MRK.11.9	Jesus was in the center of the procession, and the people all around him were shouting,
MRK.11.9	“Praise God!
MRK.11.9	Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the 
MRK.11.10	Blessings on the coming Kingdom of our ancestor David!
MRK.11.10	Praise God in highest heaven!”
MRK.11.11	So Jesus came to Jerusalem and went into the Temple. After looking around carefully at everything, he left because it was late in the afternoon. Then he returned to Bethany with the twelve disciples.
MRK.11.12	The next morning as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. 
MRK.11.13	He noticed a fig tree in full leaf a little way off, so he went over to see if he could find any figs. But there were only leaves because it was too early in the season for fruit. 
MRK.11.14	Then Jesus said to the tree, 
MRK.11.15	When they arrived back in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out the people buying and selling animals for sacrifices. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves, 
MRK.11.16	and he stopped everyone from using the Temple as a marketplace.
MRK.11.17	He said to them, 
MRK.11.18	When the leading priests and teachers of religious law heard what Jesus had done, they began planning how to kill him. But they were afraid of him because the people were so amazed at his teaching.
MRK.11.19	That evening Jesus and the disciples left
MRK.11.20	The next morning as they passed by the fig tree he had cursed, the disciples noticed it had withered from the roots up. 
MRK.11.21	Peter remembered what Jesus had said to the tree on the previous day and exclaimed, “Look, Rabbi! The fig tree you cursed has withered and died!”
MRK.11.22	Then Jesus said to the disciples, 
MRK.11.27	Again they entered Jerusalem. As Jesus was walking through the Temple area, the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders came up to him. 
MRK.11.28	They demanded, “By what authority are you doing all these things? Who gave you the right to do them?”
MRK.11.29	 Jesus replied. 
MRK.11.31	They talked it over among themselves. “If we say it was from heaven, he will ask why we didn’t believe John. 
MRK.11.32	But do we dare say it was merely human?” For they were afraid of what the people would do, because everyone believed that John was a prophet. 
MRK.11.33	So they finally replied, “We don’t know.”
MRK.11.33	And Jesus responded, 
MRK.12.1	Then Jesus began teaching them with stories: 
MRK.12.9	 Jesus asked. 
MRK.12.12	The religious leaders
MRK.12.13	Later the leaders sent some Pharisees and supporters of Herod to trap Jesus into saying something for which he could be arrested. 
MRK.12.14	“Teacher,” they said, “we know how honest you are. You are impartial and don’t play favorites. You teach the way of God truthfully. Now tell us—is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? 
MRK.12.15	Should we pay them, or shouldn’t we?”
MRK.12.15	Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said, 
MRK.12.16	When they handed it to him, he asked, 
MRK.12.16	“Caesar’s,” they replied.
MRK.12.17	 Jesus said, 
MRK.12.17	His reply completely amazed them.
MRK.12.18	Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees—religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead. They posed this question: 
MRK.12.19	“Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife without children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother’s name.
MRK.12.20	Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children. 
MRK.12.21	So the second brother married the widow, but he also died without children. Then the third brother married her. 
MRK.12.22	This continued with all seven of them, and still there were no children. Last of all, the woman also died. 
MRK.12.23	So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her.”
MRK.12.24	Jesus replied, 
MRK.12.28	One of the teachers of religious law was standing there listening to the debate. He realized that Jesus had answered well, so he asked, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?”
MRK.12.29	Jesus replied, 
MRK.12.32	The teacher of religious law replied, “Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth by saying that there is only one God and no other. 
MRK.12.33	And I know it is important to love him with all my heart and all my understanding and all my strength, and to love my neighbor as myself. This is more important than to offer all of the burnt offerings and sacrifices required in the law.”
MRK.12.34	Realizing how much the man understood, Jesus said to him, 
MRK.12.35	Later, as Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple, he asked, 
MRK.12.37	 The large crowd listened to him with great delight.
MRK.12.38	Jesus also taught: 
MRK.12.41	Jesus sat down near the collection box in the Temple and watched as the crowds dropped in their money. Many rich people put in large amounts. 
MRK.12.42	Then a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins.
MRK.12.43	Jesus called his disciples to him and said, 
MRK.13.1	As Jesus was leaving the Temple that day, one of his disciples said, “Teacher, look at these magnificent buildings! Look at the impressive stones in the walls.”
MRK.13.2	Jesus replied, 
MRK.13.3	Later, Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives across the valley from the Temple. Peter, James, John, and Andrew came to him privately and asked him, 
MRK.13.4	“Tell us, when will all this happen? What sign will show us that these things are about to be fulfilled?”
MRK.13.5	Jesus replied, 
MRK.13.14	 (Reader, pay attention!) 
MRK.14.1	It was now two days before Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The leading priests and the teachers of religious law were still looking for an opportunity to capture Jesus secretly and kill him. 
MRK.14.2	“But not during the Passover celebration,” they agreed, “or the people may riot.”
MRK.14.3	Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon, a man who had previously had leprosy. While he was eating,
MRK.14.4	Some of those at the table were indignant. “Why waste such expensive perfume?” they asked. 
MRK.14.5	“It could have been sold for a year’s wages
MRK.14.6	But Jesus replied, 
MRK.14.10	Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the leading priests to arrange to betray Jesus to them. 
MRK.14.11	They were delighted when they heard why he had come, and they promised to give him money. So he began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus.
MRK.14.12	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go to prepare the Passover meal for you?”
MRK.14.13	So Jesus sent two of them into Jerusalem with these instructions: 
MRK.14.16	So the two disciples went into the city and found everything just as Jesus had said, and they prepared the Passover meal there.
MRK.14.17	In the evening Jesus arrived with the Twelve. 
MRK.14.18	As they were at the table
MRK.14.19	Greatly distressed, each one asked in turn, “Am I the one?”
MRK.14.20	He replied, 
MRK.14.22	As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, 
MRK.14.23	And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them, and they all drank from it. 
MRK.14.24	And he said to them, 
MRK.14.26	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.
MRK.14.27	On the way, Jesus told them, 
MRK.14.29	Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else deserts you, I never will.”
MRK.14.30	Jesus replied, 
MRK.14.31	“No!” Peter declared emphatically. “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the others vowed the same.
MRK.14.32	They went to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and Jesus said, 
MRK.14.33	He took Peter, James, and John with him, and he became deeply troubled and distressed. 
MRK.14.34	He told them, 
MRK.14.35	He went on a little farther and fell to the ground. He prayed that, if it were possible, the awful hour awaiting him might pass him by. 
MRK.14.36	 he cried out, 
MRK.14.37	Then he returned and found the disciples asleep. He said to Peter, 
MRK.14.39	Then Jesus left them again and prayed the same prayer as before. 
MRK.14.40	When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open. And they didn’t know what to say.
MRK.14.41	When he returned to them the third time, he said, 
MRK.14.43	And immediately, even as Jesus said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders. 
MRK.14.44	The traitor, Judas, had given them a prearranged signal: “You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss. Then you can take him away under guard.” 
MRK.14.45	As soon as they arrived, Judas walked up to Jesus. “Rabbi!” he exclaimed, and gave him the kiss.
MRK.14.46	Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him. 
MRK.14.47	But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest’s slave, slashing off his ear.
MRK.14.48	Jesus asked them, 
MRK.14.50	Then all his disciples deserted him and ran away. 
MRK.14.51	One young man following behind was clothed only in a long linen shirt. When the mob tried to grab him, 
MRK.14.52	he slipped out of his shirt and ran away naked.
MRK.14.53	They took Jesus to the high priest’s home where the leading priests, the elders, and the teachers of religious law had gathered. 
MRK.14.54	Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and went right into the high priest’s courtyard. There he sat with the guards, warming himself by the fire.
MRK.14.55	Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council
MRK.14.56	Many false witnesses spoke against him, but they contradicted each other. 
MRK.14.57	Finally, some men stood up and gave this false testimony: 
MRK.14.58	“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this Temple made with human hands, and in three days I will build another, made without human hands.’” 
MRK.14.59	But even then they didn’t get their stories straight!
MRK.14.60	Then the high priest stood up before the others and asked Jesus, “Well, aren’t you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?” 
MRK.14.61	But Jesus was silent and made no reply. Then the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?”
MRK.14.62	Jesus said, 
MRK.14.63	Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said, “Why do we need other witnesses? 
MRK.14.64	You have all heard his blasphemy. What is your verdict?”
MRK.14.64	“Guilty!” they all cried. “He deserves to die!”
MRK.14.65	Then some of them began to spit at him, and they blindfolded him and beat him with their fists. “Prophesy to us,” they jeered. And the guards slapped him as they took him away.
MRK.14.66	Meanwhile, Peter was in the courtyard below. One of the servant girls who worked for the high priest came by 
MRK.14.67	and noticed Peter warming himself at the fire. She looked at him closely and said, “You were one of those with Jesus of Nazareth.
MRK.14.68	But Peter denied it. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said, and he went out into the entryway. Just then, a rooster crowed.
MRK.14.69	When the servant girl saw him standing there, she began telling the others, “This man is definitely one of them!” 
MRK.14.70	But Peter denied it again.
MRK.14.70	A little later some of the other bystanders confronted Peter and said, “You must be one of them, because you are a Galilean.”
MRK.14.71	Peter swore, “A curse on me if I’m lying—I don’t know this man you’re talking about!” 
MRK.14.72	And immediately the rooster crowed the second time.
MRK.14.72	Suddenly, Jesus’ words flashed through Peter’s mind: 
MRK.15.1	Very early in the morning the leading priests, the elders, and the teachers of religious law—the entire high council
MRK.15.2	Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
MRK.15.2	Jesus replied, 
MRK.15.3	Then the leading priests kept accusing him of many crimes, 
MRK.15.4	and Pilate asked him, “Aren’t you going to answer them? What about all these charges they are bringing against you?” 
MRK.15.5	But Jesus said nothing, much to Pilate’s surprise.
MRK.15.6	Now it was the governor’s custom each year during the Passover celebration to release one prisoner—anyone the people requested. 
MRK.15.7	One of the prisoners at that time was Barabbas, a revolutionary who had committed murder in an uprising. 
MRK.15.8	The crowd went to Pilate and asked him to release a prisoner as usual.
MRK.15.9	“Would you like me to release to you this ‘King of the Jews’?” Pilate asked. 
MRK.15.10	(For he realized by now that the leading priests had arrested Jesus out of envy.) 
MRK.15.11	But at this point the leading priests stirred up the crowd to demand the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus. 
MRK.15.12	Pilate asked them, “Then what should I do with this man you call the king of the Jews?”
MRK.15.13	They shouted back, “Crucify him!”
MRK.15.14	“Why?” Pilate demanded. “What crime has he committed?”
MRK.15.14	But the mob roared even louder, “Crucify him!”
MRK.15.15	So to pacify the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip, then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.
MRK.15.16	The soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard of the governor’s headquarters (called the Praetorium) and called out the entire regiment. 
MRK.15.17	They dressed him in a purple robe, and they wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head. 
MRK.15.18	Then they saluted him and taunted, “Hail! King of the Jews!” 
MRK.15.19	And they struck him on the head with a reed stick, spit on him, and dropped to their knees in mock worship. 
MRK.15.20	When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified.
MRK.15.21	A passerby named Simon, who was from Cyrene,
MRK.15.22	And they brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha (which means “Place of the Skull”). 
MRK.15.23	They offered him wine drugged with myrrh, but he refused it.
MRK.15.24	Then the soldiers nailed him to the cross. They divided his clothes and threw dice
MRK.15.25	It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him. 
MRK.15.26	A sign announced the charge against him. It read, “The King of the Jews.” 
MRK.15.27	Two revolutionaries
MRK.15.29	The people passing by shouted abuse, shaking their heads in mockery. “Ha! Look at you now!” they yelled at him. “You said you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days. 
MRK.15.30	Well then, save yourself and come down from the cross!”
MRK.15.31	The leading priests and teachers of religious law also mocked Jesus. “He saved others,” they scoffed, “but he can’t save himself! 
MRK.15.32	Let this Messiah, this King of Israel, come down from the cross so we can see it and believe him!” Even the men who were crucified with Jesus ridiculed him.
MRK.15.33	At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o’clock. 
MRK.15.34	Then at three o’clock Jesus called out with a loud voice, 
MRK.15.35	Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah. 
MRK.15.36	One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink. “Wait!” he said. “Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down!”
MRK.15.37	Then Jesus uttered another loud cry and breathed his last. 
MRK.15.38	And the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
MRK.15.39	When the Roman officer
MRK.15.40	Some women were there, watching from a distance, including Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James the younger and of Joseph
MRK.15.41	They had been followers of Jesus and had cared for him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come with him to Jerusalem were also there.
MRK.15.42	This all happened on Friday, the day of preparation,
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathea took a risk and went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. (Joseph was an honored member of the high council, and he was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come.) 
MRK.15.44	Pilate couldn’t believe that Jesus was already dead, so he called for the Roman officer and asked if he had died yet. 
MRK.15.45	The officer confirmed that Jesus was dead, so Pilate told Joseph he could have the body. 
MRK.15.46	Joseph bought a long sheet of linen cloth. Then he took Jesus’ body down from the cross, wrapped it in the cloth, and laid it in a tomb that had been carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone in front of the entrance. 
MRK.15.47	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where Jesus’ body was laid.
MRK.16.1	Saturday evening, when the Sabbath ended, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome went out and purchased burial spices so they could anoint Jesus’ body. 
MRK.16.2	Very early on Sunday morning,
MRK.16.3	On the way they were asking each other, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?” 
MRK.16.4	But as they arrived, they looked up and saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled aside.
MRK.16.5	When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side. The women were shocked, 
MRK.16.6	but the angel said, “Don’t be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth,
MRK.16.7	Now go and tell his disciples, including Peter, that Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you before he died.”
MRK.16.8	The women fled from the tomb, trembling and bewildered, and they said nothing to anyone because they were too frightened.
MRK.16.8	----------
MRK.16.8	[
MRK.16.8	[
MRK.16.8	Then they briefly reported all this to Peter and his companions. Afterward Jesus himself sent them out from east to west with the sacred and unfailing message of salvation that gives eternal life. Amen.
MRK.16.8	[
MRK.16.9	After Jesus rose from the dead early on Sunday morning, the first person who saw him was Mary Magdalene, the woman from whom he had cast out seven demons. 
MRK.16.10	She went to the disciples, who were grieving and weeping, and told them what had happened. 
MRK.16.11	But when she told them that Jesus was alive and she had seen him, they didn’t believe her.
MRK.16.12	Afterward he appeared in a different form to two of his followers who were walking from Jerusalem into the country. 
MRK.16.13	They rushed back to tell the others, but no one believed them.
MRK.16.14	Still later he appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating together. He rebuked them for their stubborn unbelief because they refused to believe those who had seen him after he had been raised from the dead.
MRK.16.15	And then he told them, 
MRK.16.19	When the Lord Jesus had finished talking with them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down in the place of honor at God’s right hand. 
MRK.16.20	And the disciples went everywhere and preached, and the Lord worked through them, confirming what they said by many miraculous signs.
LUK.1.1	Many people have set out to write accounts about the events that have been fulfilled among us. 
LUK.1.2	They used the eyewitness reports circulating among us from the early disciples.
LUK.1.3	Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write an accurate account for you, most honorable Theophilus, 
LUK.1.4	so you can be certain of the truth of everything you were taught.
LUK.1.5	When Herod was king of Judea, there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah. He was a member of the priestly order of Abijah, and his wife, Elizabeth, was also from the priestly line of Aaron. 
LUK.1.6	Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous in God’s eyes, careful to obey all of the Lord’s commandments and regulations. 
LUK.1.7	They had no children because Elizabeth was unable to conceive, and they were both very old.
LUK.1.8	One day Zechariah was serving God in the Temple, for his order was on duty that week. 
LUK.1.9	As was the custom of the priests, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense. 
LUK.1.10	While the incense was being burned, a great crowd stood outside, praying.
LUK.1.11	While Zechariah was in the sanctuary, an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the incense altar. 
LUK.1.12	Zechariah was shaken and overwhelmed with fear when he saw him. 
LUK.1.13	But the angel said, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayer. Your wife, Elizabeth, will give you a son, and you are to name him John. 
LUK.1.14	You will have great joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, 
LUK.1.15	for he will be great in the eyes of the Lord. He must never touch wine or other alcoholic drinks. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth.
LUK.1.16	And he will turn many Israelites to the Lord their God. 
LUK.1.17	He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah. He will prepare the people for the coming of the Lord. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children,
LUK.1.18	Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I be sure this will happen? I’m an old man now, and my wife is also well along in years.”
LUK.1.19	Then the angel said, “I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to bring you this good news! 
LUK.1.20	But now, since you didn’t believe what I said, you will be silent and unable to speak until the child is born. For my words will certainly be fulfilled at the proper time.”
LUK.1.21	Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the sanctuary, wondering why he was taking so long. 
LUK.1.22	When he finally did come out, he couldn’t speak to them. Then they realized from his gestures and his silence that he must have seen a vision in the sanctuary.
LUK.1.23	When Zechariah’s week of service in the Temple was over, he returned home. 
LUK.1.24	Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months. 
LUK.1.25	“How kind the Lord is!” she exclaimed. “He has taken away my disgrace of having no children.”
LUK.1.26	In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee, 
LUK.1.27	to a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David. 
LUK.1.28	Gabriel appeared to her and said, “Greetings,
LUK.1.29	Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean. 
LUK.1.30	“Don’t be afraid, Mary,” the angel told her, “for you have found favor with God! 
LUK.1.31	You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus. 
LUK.1.32	He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David. 
LUK.1.33	And he will reign over Israel
LUK.1.34	Mary asked the angel, “But how can this happen? I am a virgin.”
LUK.1.35	The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the baby to be born will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God. 
LUK.1.36	What’s more, your relative Elizabeth has become pregnant in her old age! People used to say she was barren, but she has conceived a son and is now in her sixth month. 
LUK.1.37	For the word of God will never fail.
LUK.1.38	Mary responded, “I am the Lord’s servant. May everything you have said about me come true.” And then the angel left her.
LUK.1.39	A few days later Mary hurried to the hill country of Judea, to the town 
LUK.1.40	where Zechariah lived. She entered the house and greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	At the sound of Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s child leaped within her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
LUK.1.42	Elizabeth gave a glad cry and exclaimed to Mary, “God has blessed you above all women, and your child is blessed. 
LUK.1.43	Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should visit me? 
LUK.1.44	When I heard your greeting, the baby in my womb jumped for joy. 
LUK.1.45	You are blessed because you believed that the Lord would do what he said.”
LUK.1.46	Mary responded,
LUK.1.46	“Oh, how my soul praises the Lord.
LUK.1.47	How my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!
LUK.1.48	For he took notice of his lowly servant girl,
LUK.1.48	and from now on all generations will call me blessed.
LUK.1.49	For the Mighty One is holy,
LUK.1.49	and he has done great things for me.
LUK.1.50	He shows mercy from generation to generation
LUK.1.50	to all who fear him.
LUK.1.51	His mighty arm has done tremendous things!
LUK.1.51	He has scattered the proud and haughty ones.
LUK.1.52	He has brought down princes from their thrones
LUK.1.52	and exalted the humble.
LUK.1.53	He has filled the hungry with good things
LUK.1.53	and sent the rich away with empty hands.
LUK.1.54	He has helped his servant Israel
LUK.1.54	and remembered to be merciful.
LUK.1.55	For he made this promise to our ancestors,
LUK.1.55	to Abraham and his children forever.”
LUK.1.56	Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back to her own home.
LUK.1.57	When it was time for Elizabeth’s baby to be born, she gave birth to a son. 
LUK.1.58	And when her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very merciful to her, everyone rejoiced with her.
LUK.1.59	When the baby was eight days old, they all came for the circumcision ceremony. They wanted to name him Zechariah, after his father. 
LUK.1.60	But Elizabeth said, “No! His name is John!”
LUK.1.61	“What?” they exclaimed. “There is no one in all your family by that name.” 
LUK.1.62	So they used gestures to ask the baby’s father what he wanted to name him. 
LUK.1.63	He motioned for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s surprise he wrote, “His name is John.” 
LUK.1.64	Instantly Zechariah could speak again, and he began praising God.
LUK.1.65	Awe fell upon the whole neighborhood, and the news of what had happened spread throughout the Judean hills. 
LUK.1.66	Everyone who heard about it reflected on these events and asked, “What will this child turn out to be?” For the hand of the Lord was surely upon him in a special way.
LUK.1.67	Then his father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and gave this prophecy:
LUK.1.68	“Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,
LUK.1.68	because he has visited and redeemed his people.
LUK.1.69	He has sent us a mighty Savior
LUK.1.69	from the royal line of his servant David,
LUK.1.70	just as he promised
LUK.1.70	through his holy prophets long ago.
LUK.1.71	Now we will be saved from our enemies
LUK.1.71	and from all who hate us.
LUK.1.72	He has been merciful to our ancestors
LUK.1.72	by remembering his sacred covenant—
LUK.1.73	the covenant he swore with an oath
LUK.1.73	to our ancestor Abraham.
LUK.1.74	We have been rescued from our enemies
LUK.1.74	so we can serve God without fear,
LUK.1.75	in holiness and righteousness
LUK.1.75	for as long as we live.
LUK.1.76	“And you, my little son,
LUK.1.76	will be called the prophet of the Most High,
LUK.1.76	because you will prepare the way for the Lord.
LUK.1.77	You will tell his people how to find salvation
LUK.1.77	through forgiveness of their sins.
LUK.1.78	Because of God’s tender mercy,
LUK.1.78	the morning light from heaven is about to break upon us,
LUK.1.79	to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
LUK.1.79	and to guide us to the path of peace.”
LUK.1.80	John grew up and became strong in spirit. And he lived in the wilderness until he began his public ministry to Israel.
LUK.2.1	At that time the Roman emperor, Augustus, decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire. 
LUK.2.2	(This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 
LUK.2.3	All returned to their own ancestral towns to register for this census. 
LUK.2.4	And because Joseph was a descendant of King David, he had to go to Bethlehem in Judea, David’s ancient home. He traveled there from the village of Nazareth in Galilee. 
LUK.2.5	He took with him Mary, to whom he was engaged, who was now expecting a child.
LUK.2.6	And while they were there, the time came for her baby to be born. 
LUK.2.7	She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them.
LUK.2.8	That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep. 
LUK.2.9	Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them, and the radiance of the Lord’s glory surrounded them. They were terrified, 
LUK.2.10	but the angel reassured them. “Don’t be afraid!” he said. “I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people. 
LUK.2.11	The Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David! 
LUK.2.12	And you will recognize him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.”
LUK.2.13	Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others—the armies of heaven—praising God and saying,
LUK.2.14	“Glory to God in highest heaven,
LUK.2.14	and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.”
LUK.2.15	When the angels had returned to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, “Let’s go to Bethlehem! Let’s see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”
LUK.2.16	They hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger. 
LUK.2.17	After seeing him, the shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child. 
LUK.2.18	All who heard the shepherds’ story were astonished, 
LUK.2.19	but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often. 
LUK.2.20	The shepherds went back to their flocks, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen. It was just as the angel had told them.
LUK.2.21	Eight days later, when the baby was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel even before he was conceived.
LUK.2.22	Then it was time for their purification offering, as required by the law of Moses after the birth of a child; so his parents took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord. 
LUK.2.23	The law of the Lord says, “If a woman’s first child is a boy, he must be dedicated to the 
LUK.2.24	So they offered the sacrifice required in the law of the Lord—“either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”
LUK.2.25	At that time there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon. He was righteous and devout and was eagerly waiting for the Messiah to come and rescue Israel. The Holy Spirit was upon him 
LUK.2.26	and had revealed to him that he would not die until he had seen the Lord’s Messiah. 
LUK.2.27	That day the Spirit led him to the Temple. So when Mary and Joseph came to present the baby Jesus to the Lord as the law required, 
LUK.2.28	Simeon was there. He took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,
LUK.2.29	“Sovereign Lord, now let your servant die in peace,
LUK.2.29	as you have promised.
LUK.2.30	I have seen your salvation,
LUK.2.31	which you have prepared for all people.
LUK.2.32	He is a light to reveal God to the nations,
LUK.2.32	and he is the glory of your people Israel!”
LUK.2.33	Jesus’ parents were amazed at what was being said about him. 
LUK.2.34	Then Simeon blessed them, and he said to Mary, the baby’s mother, “This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall, and many others to rise. He has been sent as a sign from God, but many will oppose him. 
LUK.2.35	As a result, the deepest thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your very soul.”
LUK.2.36	Anna, a prophet, was also there in the Temple. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. Her husband died when they had been married only seven years. 
LUK.2.37	Then she lived as a widow to the age of eighty-four.
LUK.2.38	She came along just as Simeon was talking with Mary and Joseph, and she began praising God. She talked about the child to everyone who had been waiting expectantly for God to rescue Jerusalem.
LUK.2.39	When Jesus’ parents had fulfilled all the requirements of the law of the Lord, they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee. 
LUK.2.40	There the child grew up healthy and strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God’s favor was on him.
LUK.2.41	Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. 
LUK.2.42	When Jesus was twelve years old, they attended the festival as usual. 
LUK.2.43	After the celebration was over, they started home to Nazareth, but Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents didn’t miss him at first, 
LUK.2.44	because they assumed he was among the other travelers. But when he didn’t show up that evening, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.
LUK.2.45	When they couldn’t find him, they went back to Jerusalem to search for him there. 
LUK.2.46	Three days later they finally discovered him in the Temple, sitting among the religious teachers, listening to them and asking questions. 
LUK.2.47	All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
LUK.2.48	His parents didn’t know what to think. “Son,” his mother said to him, “why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been frantic, searching for you everywhere.”
LUK.2.49	 he asked. 
LUK.2.50	But they didn’t understand what he meant.
LUK.2.51	Then he returned to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. And his mother stored all these things in her heart.
LUK.2.52	Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and all the people.
LUK.3.1	It was now the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, the Roman emperor. Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea; Herod Antipas was ruler
LUK.3.2	Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. At this time a message from God came to John son of Zechariah, who was living in the wilderness. 
LUK.3.3	Then John went from place to place on both sides of the Jordan River, preaching that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven. 
LUK.3.4	Isaiah had spoken of John when he said,
LUK.3.4	“He is a voice shouting in the wilderness,
LUK.3.4	‘Prepare the way for the 
LUK.3.4	Clear the road for him!
LUK.3.5	The valleys will be filled,
LUK.3.5	and the mountains and hills made level.
LUK.3.5	The curves will be straightened,
LUK.3.5	and the rough places made smooth.
LUK.3.6	And then all people will see
LUK.3.6	the salvation sent from God.’”
LUK.3.7	When the crowds came to John for baptism, he said, “You brood of snakes! Who warned you to flee the coming wrath? 
LUK.3.8	Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. Don’t just say to each other, ‘We’re safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.’ That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones. 
LUK.3.9	Even now the ax of God’s judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.”
LUK.3.10	The crowds asked, “What should we do?”
LUK.3.11	John replied, “If you have two shirts, give one to the poor. If you have food, share it with those who are hungry.”
LUK.3.12	Even corrupt tax collectors came to be baptized and asked, “Teacher, what should we do?”
LUK.3.13	He replied, “Collect no more taxes than the government requires.”
LUK.3.14	“What should we do?” asked some soldiers.
LUK.3.14	John replied, “Don’t extort money or make false accusations. And be content with your pay.”
LUK.3.15	Everyone was expecting the Messiah to come soon, and they were eager to know whether John might be the Messiah. 
LUK.3.16	John answered their questions by saying, “I baptize you with
LUK.3.17	He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.” 
LUK.3.18	John used many such warnings as he announced the Good News to the people.
LUK.3.19	John also publicly criticized Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee,
LUK.3.20	So Herod put John in prison, adding this sin to his many others.
LUK.3.21	One day when the crowds were being baptized, Jesus himself was baptized. As he was praying, the heavens opened, 
LUK.3.22	and the Holy Spirit, in bodily form, descended on him like a dove. And a voice from heaven said, “You are my dearly loved Son, and you bring me great joy.

LUK.4.1	Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River. He was led by the Spirit in the wilderness,
LUK.4.2	where he was tempted by the devil for forty days. Jesus ate nothing all that time and became very hungry.
LUK.4.3	Then the devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.”
LUK.4.4	But Jesus told him, 
LUK.4.5	Then the devil took him up and revealed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
LUK.4.6	“I will give you the glory of these kingdoms and authority over them,” the devil said, “because they are mine to give to anyone I please. 
LUK.4.7	I will give it all to you if you will worship me.”
LUK.4.8	Jesus replied, 
LUK.4.9	Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple, and said, “If you are the Son of God, jump off! 
LUK.4.10	For the Scriptures say,
LUK.4.10	‘He will order his angels to protect and guard you.
LUK.4.11	And they will hold you up with their hands
LUK.4.11	so you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone.’
LUK.4.12	Jesus responded, 
LUK.4.13	When the devil had finished tempting Jesus, he left him until the next opportunity came.
LUK.4.14	Then Jesus returned to Galilee, filled with the Holy Spirit’s power. Reports about him spread quickly through the whole region. 
LUK.4.15	He taught regularly in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.
LUK.4.16	When he came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures. 
LUK.4.17	The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where this was written:
LUK.4.20	He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue looked at him intently. 
LUK.4.21	Then he began to speak to them. 
LUK.4.22	Everyone spoke well of him and was amazed by the gracious words that came from his lips. “How can this be?” they asked. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”
LUK.4.23	Then he said, 
LUK.4.28	When they heard this, the people in the synagogue were furious. 
LUK.4.29	Jumping up, they mobbed him and forced him to the edge of the hill on which the town was built. They intended to push him over the cliff, 
LUK.4.30	but he passed right through the crowd and went on his way.
LUK.4.31	Then Jesus went to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and taught there in the synagogue every Sabbath day. 
LUK.4.32	There, too, the people were amazed at his teaching, for he spoke with authority.
LUK.4.33	Once when he was in the synagogue, a man possessed by a demon—an evil
LUK.4.34	“Go away! Why are you interfering with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
LUK.4.35	But Jesus reprimanded him. 
LUK.4.36	Amazed, the people exclaimed, “What authority and power this man’s words possess! Even evil spirits obey him, and they flee at his command!” 
LUK.4.37	The news about Jesus spread through every village in the entire region.
LUK.4.38	After leaving the synagogue that day, Jesus went to Simon’s home, where he found Simon’s mother-in-law very sick with a high fever. “Please heal her,” everyone begged. 
LUK.4.39	Standing at her bedside, he rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she got up at once and prepared a meal for them.
LUK.4.40	As the sun went down that evening, people throughout the village brought sick family members to Jesus. No matter what their diseases were, the touch of his hand healed every one. 
LUK.4.41	Many were possessed by demons; and the demons came out at his command, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But because they knew he was the Messiah, he rebuked them and refused to let them speak.
LUK.4.42	Early the next morning Jesus went out to an isolated place. The crowds searched everywhere for him, and when they finally found him, they begged him not to leave them. 
LUK.4.43	But he replied, 
LUK.4.44	So he continued to travel around, preaching in synagogues throughout Judea.
LUK.5.1	One day as Jesus was preaching on the shore of the Sea of Galilee,
LUK.5.2	He noticed two empty boats at the water’s edge, for the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. 
LUK.5.3	Stepping into one of the boats, Jesus asked Simon,
LUK.5.4	When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, 
LUK.5.5	“Master,” Simon replied, “we worked hard all last night and didn’t catch a thing. But if you say so, I’ll let the nets down again.” 
LUK.5.6	And this time their nets were so full of fish they began to tear! 
LUK.5.7	A shout for help brought their partners in the other boat, and soon both boats were filled with fish and on the verge of sinking.
LUK.5.8	When Simon Peter realized what had happened, he fell to his knees before Jesus and said, “Oh, Lord, please leave me—I’m such a sinful man.” 
LUK.5.9	For he was awestruck by the number of fish they had caught, as were the others with him. 
LUK.5.10	His partners, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were also amazed.
LUK.5.10	Jesus replied to Simon, 
LUK.5.11	And as soon as they landed, they left everything and followed Jesus.
LUK.5.12	In one of the villages, Jesus met a man with an advanced case of leprosy. When the man saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground, begging to be healed. “Lord,” he said, “if you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean.”
LUK.5.13	Jesus reached out and touched him. 
LUK.5.14	Then Jesus instructed him not to tell anyone what had happened. He said, 
LUK.5.15	But despite Jesus’ instructions, the report of his power spread even faster, and vast crowds came to hear him preach and to be healed of their diseases. 
LUK.5.16	But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer.
LUK.5.17	One day while Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of religious law were sitting nearby. (It seemed that these men showed up from every village in all Galilee and Judea, as well as from Jerusalem.) And the Lord’s healing power was strongly with Jesus.
LUK.5.18	Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a sleeping mat. They tried to take him inside to Jesus, 
LUK.5.19	but they couldn’t reach him because of the crowd. So they went up to the roof and took off some tiles. Then they lowered the sick man on his mat down into the crowd, right in front of Jesus. 
LUK.5.20	Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the man, 
LUK.5.21	But the Pharisees and teachers of religious law said to themselves, “Who does he think he is? That’s blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!”
LUK.5.22	Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he asked them, 
LUK.5.24	 Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, 
LUK.5.25	And immediately, as everyone watched, the man jumped up, picked up his mat, and went home praising God. 
LUK.5.26	Everyone was gripped with great wonder and awe, and they praised God, exclaiming, “We have seen amazing things today!”
LUK.5.27	Later, as Jesus left the town, he saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax collector’s booth. 
LUK.5.28	So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.
LUK.5.29	Later, Levi held a banquet in his home with Jesus as the guest of honor. Many of Levi’s fellow tax collectors and other guests also ate with them. 
LUK.5.30	But the Pharisees and their teachers of religious law complained bitterly to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with such scum?
LUK.5.31	Jesus answered them, 
LUK.5.33	One day some people said to Jesus, “John the Baptist’s disciples fast and pray regularly, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees. Why are your disciples always eating and drinking?”
LUK.5.34	Jesus responded, 
LUK.5.36	Then Jesus gave them this illustration: 
LUK.6.1	One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields, his disciples broke off heads of grain, rubbed off the husks in their hands, and ate the grain. 
LUK.6.2	But some Pharisees said, “Why are you breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?”
LUK.6.3	Jesus replied, 
LUK.6.5	And Jesus added, 
LUK.6.6	On another Sabbath day, a man with a deformed right hand was in the synagogue while Jesus was teaching. 
LUK.6.7	The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely. If he healed the man’s hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath.
LUK.6.8	But Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to the man with the deformed hand, 
LUK.6.9	Then Jesus said to his critics, 
LUK.6.10	He looked around at them one by one and then said to the man, 
LUK.6.11	At this, the enemies of Jesus were wild with rage and began to discuss what to do with him.
LUK.6.12	One day soon afterward Jesus went up on a mountain to pray, and he prayed to God all night. 
LUK.6.13	At daybreak he called together all of his disciples and chose twelve of them to be apostles. Here are their names:
LUK.6.14	Simon (whom he named Peter),
LUK.6.14	Andrew (Peter’s brother),
LUK.6.14	James,
LUK.6.14	John,
LUK.6.14	Philip,
LUK.6.14	Bartholomew,
LUK.6.15	Matthew,
LUK.6.15	Thomas,
LUK.6.15	James (son of Alphaeus),
LUK.6.15	Simon (who was called the zealot),
LUK.6.16	Judas (son of James),
LUK.6.16	Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).
LUK.6.17	When they came down from the mountain, the disciples stood with Jesus on a large, level area, surrounded by many of his followers and by the crowds. There were people from all over Judea and from Jerusalem and from as far north as the seacoasts of Tyre and Sidon. 
LUK.6.18	They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those troubled by evil
LUK.6.19	Everyone tried to touch him, because healing power went out from him, and he healed everyone.
LUK.6.20	Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said,
LUK.6.39	Then Jesus gave the following illustration: 
LUK.7.1	When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people, he returned to Capernaum. 
LUK.7.2	At that time the highly valued slave of a Roman officer
LUK.7.3	When the officer heard about Jesus, he sent some respected Jewish elders to ask him to come and heal his slave. 
LUK.7.4	So they earnestly begged Jesus to help the man. “If anyone deserves your help, he does,” they said, 
LUK.7.5	“for he loves the Jewish people and even built a synagogue for us.”
LUK.7.6	So Jesus went with them. But just before they arrived at the house, the officer sent some friends to say, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself by coming to my home, for I am not worthy of such an honor. 
LUK.7.7	I am not even worthy to come and meet you. Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed. 
LUK.7.8	I know this because I am under the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my soldiers. I only need to say, ‘Go,’ and they go, or ‘Come,’ and they come. And if I say to my slaves, ‘Do this,’ they do it.”
LUK.7.9	When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, 
LUK.7.10	And when the officer’s friends returned to his house, they found the slave completely healed.
LUK.7.11	Soon afterward Jesus went with his disciples to the village of Nain, and a large crowd followed him. 
LUK.7.12	A funeral procession was coming out as he approached the village gate. The young man who had died was a widow’s only son, and a large crowd from the village was with her. 
LUK.7.13	When the Lord saw her, his heart overflowed with compassion. 
LUK.7.14	Then he walked over to the coffin and touched it, and the bearers stopped. 
LUK.7.15	Then the dead boy sat up and began to talk! And Jesus gave him back to his mother.
LUK.7.16	Great fear swept the crowd, and they praised God, saying, “A mighty prophet has risen among us,” and “God has visited his people today.” 
LUK.7.17	And the news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding countryside.
LUK.7.18	The disciples of John the Baptist told John about everything Jesus was doing. So John called for two of his disciples, 
LUK.7.19	and he sent them to the Lord to ask him, “Are you the Messiah we’ve been expecting,
LUK.7.20	John’s two disciples found Jesus and said to him, “John the Baptist sent us to ask, ‘Are you the Messiah we’ve been expecting, or should we keep looking for someone else?’”
LUK.7.21	At that very time, Jesus cured many people of their diseases, illnesses, and evil spirits, and he restored sight to many who were blind. 
LUK.7.22	Then he told John’s disciples, 
LUK.7.24	After John’s disciples left, Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. 
LUK.7.29	When they heard this, all the people—even the tax collectors—agreed that God’s way was right,
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and experts in religious law rejected God’s plan for them, for they had refused John’s baptism.
LUK.7.31	 Jesus asked. 
LUK.7.36	One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him, so Jesus went to his home and sat down to eat.
LUK.7.37	When a certain immoral woman from that city heard he was eating there, she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. 
LUK.7.38	Then she knelt behind him at his feet, weeping. Her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them off with her hair. Then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them.
LUK.7.39	When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She’s a sinner!”
LUK.7.40	Then Jesus answered his thoughts. 
LUK.7.40	“Go ahead, Teacher,” Simon replied.
LUK.7.41	Then Jesus told him this story: 
LUK.7.43	Simon answered, “I suppose the one for whom he canceled the larger debt.”
LUK.7.43	 Jesus said. 
LUK.7.44	Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, 
LUK.7.48	Then Jesus said to the woman, 
LUK.7.49	The men at the table said among themselves, “Who is this man, that he goes around forgiving sins?”
LUK.7.50	And Jesus said to the woman, 
LUK.8.1	Soon afterward Jesus began a tour of the nearby towns and villages, preaching and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom of God. He took his twelve disciples with him, 
LUK.8.2	along with some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases. Among them were Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons; 
LUK.8.3	Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s business manager; Susanna; and many others who were contributing from their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples.
LUK.8.4	One day Jesus told a story in the form of a parable to a large crowd that had gathered from many towns to hear him: 
LUK.8.8	 When he had said this, he called out, 
LUK.8.9	His disciples asked him what this parable meant. 
LUK.8.10	He replied, 
LUK.8.19	Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they couldn’t get to him because of the crowd. 
LUK.8.20	Someone told Jesus, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and they want to see you.”
LUK.8.21	Jesus replied, 
LUK.8.22	One day Jesus said to his disciples, 
LUK.8.23	As they sailed across, Jesus settled down for a nap. But soon a fierce storm came down on the lake. The boat was filling with water, and they were in real danger.
LUK.8.24	The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, “Master, Master, we’re going to drown!”
LUK.8.24	When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and the raging waves. Suddenly the storm stopped and all was calm. 
LUK.8.25	Then he asked them, 
LUK.8.25	The disciples were terrified and amazed. “Who is this man?” they asked each other. “When he gives a command, even the wind and waves obey him!”
LUK.8.26	So they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes,
LUK.8.27	As Jesus was climbing out of the boat, a man who was possessed by demons came out to meet him. For a long time he had been homeless and naked, living in the tombs outside the town.
LUK.8.28	As soon as he saw Jesus, he shrieked and fell down in front of him. Then he screamed, “Why are you interfering with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please, I beg you, don’t torture me!” 
LUK.8.29	For Jesus had already commanded the evil
LUK.8.30	Jesus demanded, 
LUK.8.30	“Legion,” he replied, for he was filled with many demons. 
LUK.8.31	The demons kept begging Jesus not to send them into the bottomless pit.
LUK.8.32	There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby, and the demons begged him to let them enter into the pigs.
LUK.8.32	So Jesus gave them permission. 
LUK.8.33	Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the entire herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned.
LUK.8.34	When the herdsmen saw it, they fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside, spreading the news as they ran. 
LUK.8.35	People rushed out to see what had happened. A crowd soon gathered around Jesus, and they saw the man who had been freed from the demons. He was sitting at Jesus’ feet, fully clothed and perfectly sane, and they were all afraid. 
LUK.8.36	Then those who had seen what happened told the others how the demon-possessed man had been healed. 
LUK.8.37	And all the people in the region of the Gerasenes begged Jesus to go away and leave them alone, for a great wave of fear swept over them.
LUK.8.37	So Jesus returned to the boat and left, crossing back to the other side of the lake. 
LUK.8.38	The man who had been freed from the demons begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him home, saying, 
LUK.8.39	 So he went all through the town proclaiming the great things Jesus had done for him.
LUK.8.40	On the other side of the lake the crowds welcomed Jesus, because they had been waiting for him. 
LUK.8.41	Then a man named Jairus, a leader of the local synagogue, came and fell at Jesus’ feet, pleading with him to come home with him. 
LUK.8.42	His only daughter,
LUK.8.42	As Jesus went with him, he was surrounded by the crowds. 
LUK.8.43	A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding,
LUK.8.44	Coming up behind Jesus, she touched the fringe of his robe. Immediately, the bleeding stopped.
LUK.8.45	 Jesus asked.
LUK.8.45	Everyone denied it, and Peter said, “Master, this whole crowd is pressing up against you.”
LUK.8.46	But Jesus said, 
LUK.8.47	When the woman realized that she could not stay hidden, she began to tremble and fell to her knees in front of him. The whole crowd heard her explain why she had touched him and that she had been immediately healed. 
LUK.8.48	 he said to her, 
LUK.8.49	While he was still speaking to her, a messenger arrived from the home of Jairus, the leader of the synagogue. He told him, “Your daughter is dead. There’s no use troubling the Teacher now.”
LUK.8.50	But when Jesus heard what had happened, he said to Jairus, 
LUK.8.51	When they arrived at the house, Jesus wouldn’t let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the little girl’s father and mother. 
LUK.8.52	The house was filled with people weeping and wailing, but he said, 
LUK.8.53	But the crowd laughed at him because they all knew she had died. 
LUK.8.54	Then Jesus took her by the hand and said in a loud voice, 
LUK.8.55	And at that moment her life
LUK.8.56	Her parents were overwhelmed, but Jesus insisted that they not tell anyone what had happened.
LUK.9.1	One day Jesus called together his twelve disciples
LUK.9.2	Then he sent them out to tell everyone about the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 
LUK.9.3	 he instructed them. 
LUK.9.6	So they began their circuit of the villages, preaching the Good News and healing the sick.
LUK.9.7	When Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee,
LUK.9.8	Others thought Jesus was Elijah or one of the other prophets risen from the dead.
LUK.9.9	“I beheaded John,” Herod said, “so who is this man about whom I hear such stories?” And he kept trying to see him.
LUK.9.10	When the apostles returned, they told Jesus everything they had done. Then he slipped quietly away with them toward the town of Bethsaida. 
LUK.9.11	But the crowds found out where he was going, and they followed him. He welcomed them and taught them about the Kingdom of God, and he healed those who were sick.
LUK.9.12	Late in the afternoon the twelve disciples came to him and said, “Send the crowds away to the nearby villages and farms, so they can find food and lodging for the night. There is nothing to eat here in this remote place.”
LUK.9.13	But Jesus said, 
LUK.9.13	“But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered. “Or are you expecting us to go and buy enough food for this whole crowd?” 
LUK.9.14	For there were about 5,000 men there.
LUK.9.14	Jesus replied, 
LUK.9.15	So the people all sat down. 
LUK.9.16	Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he kept giving the bread and fish to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people. 
LUK.9.17	They all ate as much as they wanted, and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftovers!
LUK.9.18	One day Jesus left the crowds to pray alone. Only his disciples were with him, and he asked them, 
LUK.9.19	“Well,” they replied, “some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other ancient prophets risen from the dead.”
LUK.9.20	Then he asked them, 
LUK.9.20	Peter replied, “You are the Messiah
LUK.9.21	Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone who he was. 
LUK.9.22	 he said. 
LUK.9.23	Then he said to the crowd, 
LUK.9.28	About eight days later Jesus took Peter, John, and James up on a mountain to pray. 
LUK.9.29	And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was transformed, and his clothes became dazzling white. 
LUK.9.30	Suddenly, two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared and began talking with Jesus. 
LUK.9.31	They were glorious to see. And they were speaking about his exodus from this world, which was about to be fulfilled in Jerusalem.
LUK.9.32	Peter and the others had fallen asleep. When they woke up, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with him. 
LUK.9.33	As Moses and Elijah were starting to leave, Peter, not even knowing what he was saying, blurted out, “Master, it’s wonderful for us to be here! Let’s make three shelters as memorials
LUK.9.34	But even as he was saying this, a cloud overshadowed them, and terror gripped them as the cloud covered them.
LUK.9.35	Then a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, my Chosen One.
LUK.9.36	When the voice finished, Jesus was there alone. They didn’t tell anyone at that time what they had seen.
LUK.9.37	The next day, after they had come down the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus. 
LUK.9.38	A man in the crowd called out to him, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, my only child. 
LUK.9.39	An evil spirit keeps seizing him, making him scream. It throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It batters him and hardly ever leaves him alone. 
LUK.9.40	I begged your disciples to cast out the spirit, but they couldn’t do it.”
LUK.9.41	Jesus said, 
LUK.9.42	As the boy came forward, the demon knocked him to the ground and threw him into a violent convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil
LUK.9.43	Awe gripped the people as they saw this majestic display of God’s power.
LUK.9.43	While everyone was marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples, 
LUK.9.45	But they didn’t know what he meant. Its significance was hidden from them, so they couldn’t understand it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.
LUK.9.46	Then his disciples began arguing about which of them was the greatest. 
LUK.9.47	But Jesus knew their thoughts, so he brought a little child to his side. 
LUK.9.48	Then he said to them, 
LUK.9.49	John said to Jesus, “Master, we saw someone using your name to cast out demons, but we told him to stop because he isn’t in our group.”
LUK.9.50	But Jesus said, 
LUK.9.51	As the time drew near for him to ascend to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.52	He sent messengers ahead to a Samaritan village to prepare for his arrival. 
LUK.9.53	But the people of the village did not welcome Jesus because he was on his way to Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.54	When James and John saw this, they said to Jesus, “Lord, should we call down fire from heaven to burn them up
LUK.9.55	But Jesus turned and rebuked them.
LUK.9.56	So they went on to another village.
LUK.9.57	As they were walking along, someone said to Jesus, “I will follow you wherever you go.”
LUK.9.58	But Jesus replied, 
LUK.9.59	He said to another person, 
LUK.9.59	The man agreed, but he said, “Lord, first let me return home and bury my father.”
LUK.9.60	But Jesus told him, 
LUK.9.61	Another said, “Yes, Lord, I will follow you, but first let me say good-bye to my family.”
LUK.9.62	But Jesus told him, 
LUK.10.1	The Lord now chose seventy-two
LUK.10.2	These were his instructions to them: 
LUK.10.16	Then he said to the disciples, 
LUK.10.17	When the seventy-two disciples returned, they joyfully reported to him, “Lord, even the demons obey us when we use your name!”
LUK.10.18	 he told them, 
LUK.10.21	At that same time Jesus was filled with the joy of the Holy Spirit, and he said, 
LUK.10.23	Then when they were alone, he turned to the disciples and said, 
LUK.10.25	One day an expert in religious law stood up to test Jesus by asking him this question: “Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?”
LUK.10.26	Jesus replied, 
LUK.10.27	The man answered, “‘You must love the 
LUK.10.28	 Jesus told him. 
LUK.10.29	The man wanted to justify his actions, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”
LUK.10.30	Jesus replied with a story: 
LUK.10.36	 Jesus asked.
LUK.10.37	The man replied, “The one who showed him mercy.”
LUK.10.37	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.10.38	As Jesus and the disciples continued on their way to Jerusalem, they came to a certain village where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home. 
LUK.10.39	Her sister, Mary, sat at the Lord’s feet, listening to what he taught. 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was distracted by the big dinner she was preparing. She came to Jesus and said, “Lord, doesn’t it seem unfair to you that my sister just sits here while I do all the work? Tell her to come and help me.”
LUK.10.41	But the Lord said to her, 
LUK.11.1	Once Jesus was in a certain place praying. As he finished, one of his disciples came to him and said, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”
LUK.11.2	Jesus said, 
LUK.11.5	Then, teaching them more about prayer, he used this story: 
LUK.11.14	One day Jesus cast out a demon from a man who couldn’t speak, and when the demon was gone, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed, 
LUK.11.15	but some of them said, “No wonder he can cast out demons. He gets his power from Satan,
LUK.11.16	Others, trying to test Jesus, demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.
LUK.11.17	He knew their thoughts, so he said, 
LUK.11.27	As he was speaking, a woman in the crowd called out, “God bless your mother—the womb from which you came, and the breasts that nursed you!”
LUK.11.28	Jesus replied, 
LUK.11.29	As the crowd pressed in on Jesus, he said, 
LUK.11.37	As Jesus was speaking, one of the Pharisees invited him home for a meal. So he went in and took his place at the table.
LUK.11.38	His host was amazed to see that he sat down to eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony required by Jewish custom. 
LUK.11.39	Then the Lord said to him, 
LUK.11.45	“Teacher,” said an expert in religious law, “you have insulted us, too, in what you just said.”
LUK.11.46	 said Jesus, 
LUK.11.53	As Jesus was leaving, the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees became hostile and tried to provoke him with many questions. 
LUK.11.54	They wanted to trap him into saying something they could use against him.
LUK.12.1	Meanwhile, the crowds grew until thousands were milling about and stepping on each other. Jesus turned first to his disciples and warned them, 
LUK.12.13	Then someone called from the crowd, “Teacher, please tell my brother to divide our father’s estate with me.”
LUK.12.14	Jesus replied, 
LUK.12.15	Then he said, 
LUK.12.16	Then he told them a story: 
LUK.12.22	Then, turning to his disciples, Jesus said, 
LUK.12.41	Peter asked, “Lord, is that illustration just for us or for everyone?”
LUK.12.42	And the Lord replied, 
LUK.12.54	Then Jesus turned to the crowd and said, 
LUK.13.1	About this time Jesus was informed that Pilate had murdered some people from Galilee as they were offering sacrifices at the Temple. 
LUK.13.2	 Jesus asked. 
LUK.13.6	Then Jesus told this story: 
LUK.13.10	One Sabbath day as Jesus was teaching in a synagogue, 
LUK.13.11	he saw a woman who had been crippled by an evil spirit. She had been bent double for eighteen years and was unable to stand up straight. 
LUK.13.12	When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said, 
LUK.13.13	Then he touched her, and instantly she could stand straight. How she praised God!
LUK.13.14	But the leader in charge of the synagogue was indignant that Jesus had healed her on the Sabbath day. “There are six days of the week for working,” he said to the crowd. “Come on those days to be healed, not on the Sabbath.”
LUK.13.15	But the Lord replied, 
LUK.13.17	This shamed his enemies, but all the people rejoiced at the wonderful things he did.
LUK.13.18	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.13.20	He also asked, 
LUK.13.22	Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he went, always pressing on toward Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.23	Someone asked him, “Lord, will only a few be saved?”
LUK.13.23	He replied, 
LUK.13.31	At that time some Pharisees said to him, “Get away from here if you want to live! Herod Antipas wants to kill you!”
LUK.13.32	Jesus replied, 
LUK.14.1	One Sabbath day Jesus went to eat dinner in the home of a leader of the Pharisees, and the people were watching him closely. 
LUK.14.2	There was a man there whose arms and legs were swollen.
LUK.14.3	Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in religious law, 
LUK.14.4	When they refused to answer, Jesus touched the sick man and healed him and sent him away. 
LUK.14.5	Then he turned to them and said, 
LUK.14.6	Again they could not answer.
LUK.14.7	When Jesus noticed that all who had come to the dinner were trying to sit in the seats of honor near the head of the table, he gave them this advice: 
LUK.14.12	Then he turned to his host. 
LUK.14.15	Hearing this, a man sitting at the table with Jesus exclaimed, “What a blessing it will be to attend a banquet
LUK.14.16	Jesus replied with this story: 
LUK.14.25	A large crowd was following Jesus. He turned around and said to them, 
LUK.15.1	Tax collectors and other notorious sinners often came to listen to Jesus teach. 
LUK.15.2	This made the Pharisees and teachers of religious law complain that he was associating with such sinful people—even eating with them!
LUK.15.3	So Jesus told them this story: 
LUK.15.11	To illustrate the point further, Jesus told them this story: 
LUK.16.1	Jesus told this story to his disciples: 
LUK.16.14	The Pharisees, who dearly loved their money, heard all this and scoffed at him. 
LUK.16.15	Then he said to them, 
LUK.16.19	Jesus said, 
LUK.17.1	One day Jesus said to his disciples, 
LUK.17.5	The apostles said to the Lord, “Show us how to increase our faith.”
LUK.17.6	The Lord answered, 
LUK.17.11	As Jesus continued on toward Jerusalem, he reached the border between Galilee and Samaria. 
LUK.17.12	As he entered a village there, ten men with leprosy stood at a distance, 
LUK.17.13	crying out, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”
LUK.17.14	He looked at them and said, 
LUK.17.15	One of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back to Jesus, shouting, “Praise God!” 
LUK.17.16	He fell to the ground at Jesus’ feet, thanking him for what he had done. This man was a Samaritan.
LUK.17.17	Jesus asked, 
LUK.17.19	And Jesus said to the man, 
LUK.17.20	One day the Pharisees asked Jesus, “When will the Kingdom of God come?”
LUK.17.20	Jesus replied, 
LUK.17.22	Then he said to his disciples, 
LUK.17.37	“Where will this happen, Lord?”
LUK.17.37	Jesus replied, 
LUK.18.1	One day Jesus told his disciples a story to show that they should always pray and never give up. 
LUK.18.2	 he said, 
LUK.18.6	Then the Lord said, 
LUK.18.9	Then Jesus told this story to some who had great confidence in their own righteousness and scorned everyone else: 
LUK.18.15	One day some parents brought their little children to Jesus so he could touch and bless them. But when the disciples saw this, they scolded the parents for bothering him.
LUK.18.16	Then Jesus called for the children and said to the disciples, 
LUK.18.18	Once a religious leader asked Jesus this question: “Good Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?”
LUK.18.19	 Jesus asked him. 
LUK.18.21	The man replied, “I’ve obeyed all these commandments since I was young.”
LUK.18.22	When Jesus heard his answer, he said, 
LUK.18.23	But when the man heard this he became very sad, for he was very rich.
LUK.18.24	When Jesus saw this,
LUK.18.26	Those who heard this said, “Then who in the world can be saved?”
LUK.18.27	He replied, 
LUK.18.28	Peter said, “We’ve left our homes to follow you.”
LUK.18.29	 Jesus replied, 
LUK.18.31	Taking the twelve disciples aside, Jesus said, 
LUK.18.34	But they didn’t understand any of this. The significance of his words was hidden from them, and they failed to grasp what he was talking about.
LUK.18.35	As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind beggar was sitting beside the road. 
LUK.18.36	When he heard the noise of a crowd going past, he asked what was happening. 
LUK.18.37	They told him that Jesus the Nazarene
LUK.18.38	So he began shouting, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
LUK.18.39	“Be quiet!” the people in front yelled at him.
LUK.18.39	But he only shouted louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
LUK.18.40	When Jesus heard him, he stopped and ordered that the man be brought to him. As the man came near, Jesus asked him, 
LUK.18.41	“Lord,” he said, “I want to see!”
LUK.18.42	And Jesus said, 
LUK.18.43	Instantly the man could see, and he followed Jesus, praising God. And all who saw it praised God, too.
LUK.19.1	Jesus entered Jericho and made his way through the town. 
LUK.19.2	There was a man there named Zacchaeus. He was the chief tax collector in the region, and he had become very rich. 
LUK.19.3	He tried to get a look at Jesus, but he was too short to see over the crowd. 
LUK.19.4	So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree beside the road, for Jesus was going to pass that way.
LUK.19.5	When Jesus came by, he looked up at Zacchaeus and called him by name. 
LUK.19.6	Zacchaeus quickly climbed down and took Jesus to his house in great excitement and joy. 
LUK.19.7	But the people were displeased. “He has gone to be the guest of a notorious sinner,” they grumbled.
LUK.19.8	Meanwhile, Zacchaeus stood before the Lord and said, “I will give half my wealth to the poor, Lord, and if I have cheated people on their taxes, I will give them back four times as much!”
LUK.19.9	Jesus responded, 
LUK.19.11	The crowd was listening to everything Jesus said. And because he was nearing Jerusalem, he told them a story to correct the impression that the Kingdom of God would begin right away. 
LUK.19.12	He said, 
LUK.19.28	After telling this story, Jesus went on toward Jerusalem, walking ahead of his disciples. 
LUK.19.29	As he came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, he sent two disciples ahead. 
LUK.19.30	 he told them. 
LUK.19.32	So they went and found the colt, just as Jesus had said. 
LUK.19.33	And sure enough, as they were untying it, the owners asked them, “Why are you untying that colt?”
LUK.19.34	And the disciples simply replied, “The Lord needs it.” 
LUK.19.35	So they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments over it for him to ride on.
LUK.19.36	As he rode along, the crowds spread out their garments on the road ahead of him. 
LUK.19.37	When he reached the place where the road started down the Mount of Olives, all of his followers began to shout and sing as they walked along, praising God for all the wonderful miracles they had seen.
LUK.19.38	“Blessings on the King who comes in the name of the 
LUK.19.38	Peace in heaven, and glory in highest heaven!”
LUK.19.39	But some of the Pharisees among the crowd said, “Teacher, rebuke your followers for saying things like that!”
LUK.19.40	He replied, 
LUK.19.41	But as he came closer to Jerusalem and saw the city ahead, he began to weep. 
LUK.19.45	Then Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out the people selling animals for sacrifices. 
LUK.19.46	He said to them, 
LUK.19.47	After that, he taught daily in the Temple, but the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the other leaders of the people began planning how to kill him. 
LUK.19.48	But they could think of nothing, because all the people hung on every word he said.
LUK.20.1	One day as Jesus was teaching the people and preaching the Good News in the Temple, the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders came up to him. 
LUK.20.2	They demanded, “By what authority are you doing all these things? Who gave you the right?”
LUK.20.3	 he replied. 
LUK.20.5	They talked it over among themselves. “If we say it was from heaven, he will ask why we didn’t believe John. 
LUK.20.6	But if we say it was merely human, the people will stone us because they are convinced John was a prophet.” 
LUK.20.7	So they finally replied that they didn’t know.
LUK.20.8	And Jesus responded, 
LUK.20.9	Now Jesus turned to the people again and told them this story: 
LUK.20.15	 Jesus asked. 
LUK.20.16	“How terrible that such a thing should ever happen,” his listeners protested.
LUK.20.17	Jesus looked at them and said, 
LUK.20.19	The teachers of religious law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus immediately because they realized he was telling the story against them—they were the wicked farmers. But they were afraid of the people’s reaction.
LUK.20.20	Watching for their opportunity, the leaders sent spies pretending to be honest men. They tried to get Jesus to say something that could be reported to the Roman governor so he would arrest Jesus. 
LUK.20.21	“Teacher,” they said, “we know that you speak and teach what is right and are not influenced by what others think. You teach the way of God truthfully. 
LUK.20.22	Now tell us—is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
LUK.20.23	He saw through their trickery and said, 
LUK.20.24	“Caesar’s,” they replied.
LUK.20.25	 he said, 
LUK.20.26	So they failed to trap him by what he said in front of the people. Instead, they were amazed by his answer, and they became silent.
LUK.20.27	Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees—religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead. 
LUK.20.28	They posed this question: “Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother’s name.
LUK.20.29	Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children. 
LUK.20.30	So the second brother married the widow, but he also died. 
LUK.20.31	Then the third brother married her. This continued with all seven of them, who died without children. 
LUK.20.32	Finally, the woman also died. 
LUK.20.33	So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her!”
LUK.20.34	Jesus replied, 
LUK.20.39	“Well said, Teacher!” remarked some of the teachers of religious law who were standing there. 
LUK.20.40	And then no one dared to ask him any more questions.
LUK.20.41	Then Jesus presented them with a question. 
LUK.20.45	Then, with the crowds listening, he turned to his disciples and said, 
LUK.21.1	While Jesus was in the Temple, he watched the rich people dropping their gifts in the collection box. 
LUK.21.2	Then a poor widow came by and dropped in two small coins.
LUK.21.3	 Jesus said, 
LUK.21.5	Some of his disciples began talking about the majestic stonework of the Temple and the memorial decorations on the walls. But Jesus said, 
LUK.21.7	“Teacher,” they asked, “when will all this happen? What sign will show us that these things are about to take place?”
LUK.21.8	He replied, 
LUK.21.10	Then he added, 
LUK.21.29	Then he gave them this illustration: 
LUK.21.37	Every day Jesus went to the Temple to teach, and each evening he returned to spend the night on the Mount of Olives. 
LUK.21.38	The crowds gathered at the Temple early each morning to hear him.
LUK.22.1	The Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is also called Passover, was approaching. 
LUK.22.2	The leading priests and teachers of religious law were plotting how to kill Jesus, but they were afraid of the people’s reaction.
LUK.22.3	Then Satan entered into Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve disciples, 
LUK.22.4	and he went to the leading priests and captains of the Temple guard to discuss the best way to betray Jesus to them. 
LUK.22.5	They were delighted, and they promised to give him money. 
LUK.22.6	So he agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus so they could arrest him when the crowds weren’t around.
LUK.22.7	Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread arrived, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed. 
LUK.22.8	Jesus sent Peter and John ahead and said, 
LUK.22.9	“Where do you want us to prepare it?” they asked him.
LUK.22.10	He replied, 
LUK.22.13	They went off to the city and found everything just as Jesus had said, and they prepared the Passover meal there.
LUK.22.14	When the time came, Jesus and the apostles sat down together at the table.
LUK.22.15	Jesus said, 
LUK.22.17	Then he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. Then he said, 
LUK.22.19	He took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, 
LUK.22.20	After supper he took another cup of wine and said, 
LUK.22.23	The disciples began to ask each other which of them would ever do such a thing.
LUK.22.24	Then they began to argue among themselves about who would be the greatest among them. 
LUK.22.25	Jesus told them, 
LUK.22.33	Peter said, “Lord, I am ready to go to prison with you, and even to die with you.”
LUK.22.34	But Jesus said, 
LUK.22.35	Then Jesus asked them, 
LUK.22.35	“No,” they replied.
LUK.22.36	 he said, 
LUK.22.38	“Look, Lord,” they replied, “we have two swords among us.”
LUK.22.38	 he said.
LUK.22.39	Then, accompanied by the disciples, Jesus left the upstairs room and went as usual to the Mount of Olives. 
LUK.22.40	There he told them, 
LUK.22.41	He walked away, about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and prayed, 
LUK.22.43	Then an angel from heaven appeared and strengthened him. 
LUK.22.44	He prayed more fervently, and he was in such agony of spirit that his sweat fell to the ground like great drops of blood.
LUK.22.45	At last he stood up again and returned to the disciples, only to find them asleep, exhausted from grief. 
LUK.22.46	 he asked them. 
LUK.22.47	But even as Jesus said this, a crowd approached, led by Judas, one of the twelve disciples. Judas walked over to Jesus to greet him with a kiss. 
LUK.22.48	But Jesus said, 
LUK.22.49	When the other disciples saw what was about to happen, they exclaimed, “Lord, should we fight? We brought the swords!” 
LUK.22.50	And one of them struck at the high priest’s slave, slashing off his right ear.
LUK.22.51	But Jesus said, 
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus spoke to the leading priests, the captains of the Temple guard, and the elders who had come for him. 
LUK.22.54	So they arrested him and led him to the high priest’s home. And Peter followed at a distance. 
LUK.22.55	The guards lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter joined them there. 
LUK.22.56	A servant girl noticed him in the firelight and began staring at him. Finally she said, “This man was one of Jesus’ followers!”
LUK.22.57	But Peter denied it. “Woman,” he said, “I don’t even know him!”
LUK.22.58	After a while someone else looked at him and said, “You must be one of them!”
LUK.22.58	“No, man, I’m not!” Peter retorted.
LUK.22.59	About an hour later someone else insisted, “This must be one of them, because he is a Galilean, too.”
LUK.22.60	But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
LUK.22.61	At that moment the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Suddenly, the Lord’s words flashed through Peter’s mind: 
LUK.22.62	And Peter left the courtyard, weeping bitterly.
LUK.22.63	The guards in charge of Jesus began mocking and beating him. 
LUK.22.64	They blindfolded him and said, “Prophesy to us! Who hit you that time?” 
LUK.22.65	And they hurled all sorts of terrible insults at him.
LUK.22.66	At daybreak all the elders of the people assembled, including the leading priests and the teachers of religious law. Jesus was led before this high council,
LUK.22.67	and they said, “Tell us, are you the Messiah?”
LUK.22.67	But he replied, 
LUK.22.70	They all shouted, “So, are you claiming to be the Son of God?”
LUK.22.70	And he replied, 
LUK.22.71	“Why do we need other witnesses?” they said. “We ourselves heard him say it.”
LUK.23.1	Then the entire council took Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor. 
LUK.23.2	They began to state their case: “This man has been leading our people astray by telling them not to pay their taxes to the Roman government and by claiming he is the Messiah, a king.”
LUK.23.3	So Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
LUK.23.3	Jesus replied, 
LUK.23.4	Pilate turned to the leading priests and to the crowd and said, “I find nothing wrong with this man!”
LUK.23.5	Then they became insistent. “But he is causing riots by his teaching wherever he goes—all over Judea, from Galilee to Jerusalem!”
LUK.23.6	“Oh, is he a Galilean?” Pilate asked. 
LUK.23.7	When they said that he was, Pilate sent him to Herod Antipas, because Galilee was under Herod’s jurisdiction, and Herod happened to be in Jerusalem at the time.
LUK.23.8	Herod was delighted at the opportunity to see Jesus, because he had heard about him and had been hoping for a long time to see him perform a miracle. 
LUK.23.9	He asked Jesus question after question, but Jesus refused to answer. 
LUK.23.10	Meanwhile, the leading priests and the teachers of religious law stood there shouting their accusations. 
LUK.23.11	Then Herod and his soldiers began mocking and ridiculing Jesus. Finally, they put a royal robe on him and sent him back to Pilate. 
LUK.23.12	(Herod and Pilate, who had been enemies before, became friends that day.)
LUK.23.13	Then Pilate called together the leading priests and other religious leaders, along with the people, 
LUK.23.14	and he announced his verdict. “You brought this man to me, accusing him of leading a revolt. I have examined him thoroughly on this point in your presence and find him innocent. 
LUK.23.15	Herod came to the same conclusion and sent him back to us. Nothing this man has done calls for the death penalty. 
LUK.23.16	So I will have him flogged, and then I will release him.”
LUK.23.18	Then a mighty roar rose from the crowd, and with one voice they shouted, “Kill him, and release Barabbas to us!” 
LUK.23.19	(Barabbas was in prison for taking part in an insurrection in Jerusalem against the government, and for murder.) 
LUK.23.20	Pilate argued with them, because he wanted to release Jesus. 
LUK.23.21	But they kept shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
LUK.23.22	For the third time he demanded, “Why? What crime has he committed? I have found no reason to sentence him to death. So I will have him flogged, and then I will release him.”
LUK.23.23	But the mob shouted louder and louder, demanding that Jesus be crucified, and their voices prevailed. 
LUK.23.24	So Pilate sentenced Jesus to die as they demanded. 
LUK.23.25	As they had requested, he released Barabbas, the man in prison for insurrection and murder. But he turned Jesus over to them to do as they wished.
LUK.23.26	As they led Jesus away, a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene,
LUK.23.27	A large crowd trailed behind, including many grief-stricken women. 
LUK.23.28	But Jesus turned and said to them, 
LUK.23.32	Two others, both criminals, were led out to be executed with him. 
LUK.23.33	When they came to a place called The Skull,
LUK.23.34	Jesus said, 
LUK.23.35	The crowd watched and the leaders scoffed. “He saved others,” they said, “let him save himself if he is really God’s Messiah, the Chosen One.” 
LUK.23.36	The soldiers mocked him, too, by offering him a drink of sour wine. 
LUK.23.37	They called out to him, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” 
LUK.23.38	A sign was fastened above him with these words: “This is the King of the Jews.”
LUK.23.39	One of the criminals hanging beside him scoffed, “So you’re the Messiah, are you? Prove it by saving yourself—and us, too, while you’re at it!”
LUK.23.40	But the other criminal protested, “Don’t you fear God even when you have been sentenced to die? 
LUK.23.41	We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man hasn’t done anything wrong.” 
LUK.23.42	Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”
LUK.23.43	And Jesus replied, 
LUK.23.44	By this time it was about noon, and darkness fell across the whole land until three o’clock. 
LUK.23.45	The light from the sun was gone. And suddenly, the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn down the middle. 
LUK.23.46	Then Jesus shouted, 
LUK.23.47	When the Roman officer
LUK.23.48	And when all the crowd that came to see the crucifixion saw what had happened, they went home in deep sorrow.
LUK.23.49	But Jesus’ friends, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching.
LUK.23.50	Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph. He was a member of the Jewish high council, 
LUK.23.51	but he had not agreed with the decision and actions of the other religious leaders. He was from the town of Arimathea in Judea, and he was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come. 
LUK.23.52	He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. 
LUK.23.53	Then he took the body down from the cross and wrapped it in a long sheet of linen cloth and laid it in a new tomb that had been carved out of rock. 
LUK.23.54	This was done late on Friday afternoon, the day of preparation,
LUK.23.55	As his body was taken away, the women from Galilee followed and saw the tomb where his body was placed. 
LUK.23.56	Then they went home and prepared spices and ointments to anoint his body. But by the time they were finished the Sabbath had begun, so they rested as required by the law.
LUK.24.1	But very early on Sunday morning
LUK.24.2	They found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance. 
LUK.24.3	So they went in, but they didn’t find the body of the Lord Jesus. 
LUK.24.4	As they stood there puzzled, two men suddenly appeared to them, clothed in dazzling robes.
LUK.24.5	The women were terrified and bowed with their faces to the ground. Then the men asked, “Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is alive? 
LUK.24.6	He isn’t here! He is risen from the dead! Remember what he told you back in Galilee, 
LUK.24.7	that the Son of Man
LUK.24.8	Then they remembered that he had said this. 
LUK.24.9	So they rushed back from the tomb to tell his eleven disciples—and everyone else—what had happened. 
LUK.24.10	It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and several other women who told the apostles what had happened. 
LUK.24.11	But the story sounded like nonsense to the men, so they didn’t believe it. 
LUK.24.12	However, Peter jumped up and ran to the tomb to look. Stooping, he peered in and saw the empty linen wrappings; then he went home again, wondering what had happened.
LUK.24.13	That same day two of Jesus’ followers were walking to the village of Emmaus, seven miles
LUK.24.14	As they walked along they were talking about everything that had happened. 
LUK.24.15	As they talked and discussed these things, Jesus himself suddenly came and began walking with them. 
LUK.24.16	But God kept them from recognizing him.
LUK.24.17	He asked them, 
LUK.24.17	They stopped short, sadness written across their faces. 
LUK.24.18	Then one of them, Cleopas, replied, “You must be the only person in Jerusalem who hasn’t heard about all the things that have happened there the last few days.”
LUK.24.19	 Jesus asked.
LUK.24.19	“The things that happened to Jesus, the man from Nazareth,” they said. “He was a prophet who did powerful miracles, and he was a mighty teacher in the eyes of God and all the people. 
LUK.24.20	But our leading priests and other religious leaders handed him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified him. 
LUK.24.21	We had hoped he was the Messiah who had come to rescue Israel. This all happened three days ago.
LUK.24.22	“Then some women from our group of his followers were at his tomb early this morning, and they came back with an amazing report. 
LUK.24.23	They said his body was missing, and they had seen angels who told them Jesus is alive! 
LUK.24.24	Some of our men ran out to see, and sure enough, his body was gone, just as the women had said.”
LUK.24.25	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.24.27	Then Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
LUK.24.28	By this time they were nearing Emmaus and the end of their journey. Jesus acted as if he were going on, 
LUK.24.29	but they begged him, “Stay the night with us, since it is getting late.” So he went home with them. 
LUK.24.30	As they sat down to eat,
LUK.24.31	Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And at that moment he disappeared!
LUK.24.32	They said to each other, “Didn’t our hearts burn within us as he talked with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us?” 
LUK.24.33	And within the hour they were on their way back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples and the others who had gathered with them, 
LUK.24.34	who said, “The Lord has really risen! He appeared to Peter.
LUK.24.35	Then the two from Emmaus told their story of how Jesus had appeared to them as they were walking along the road, and how they had recognized him as he was breaking the bread. 
LUK.24.36	And just as they were telling about it, Jesus himself was suddenly standing there among them. 
LUK.24.37	But the whole group was startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost!
LUK.24.38	 he asked. 
LUK.24.40	As he spoke, he showed them his hands and his feet.
LUK.24.41	Still they stood there in disbelief, filled with joy and wonder. Then he asked them, 
LUK.24.42	They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 
LUK.24.43	and he ate it as they watched.
LUK.24.44	Then he said, 
LUK.24.45	Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures. 
LUK.24.46	And he said, 
LUK.24.50	Then Jesus led them to Bethany, and lifting his hands to heaven, he blessed them. 
LUK.24.51	While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up to heaven. 
LUK.24.52	So they worshiped him and then returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy. 
LUK.24.53	And they spent all of their time in the Temple, praising God.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning the Word already existed.
JHN.1.1	The Word was with God,
JHN.1.1	and the Word was God.
JHN.1.2	He existed in the beginning with God.
JHN.1.3	God created everything through him,
JHN.1.3	and nothing was created except through him.
JHN.1.4	The Word gave life to everything that was created,
JHN.1.4	and his life brought light to everyone.
JHN.1.5	The light shines in the darkness,
JHN.1.5	and the darkness can never extinguish it.
JHN.1.6	God sent a man, John the Baptist,
JHN.1.7	to tell about the light so that everyone might believe because of his testimony. 
JHN.1.8	John himself was not the light; he was simply a witness to tell about the light. 
JHN.1.9	The one who is the true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.
JHN.1.10	He came into the very world he created, but the world didn’t recognize him. 
JHN.1.11	He came to his own people, and even they rejected him. 
JHN.1.12	But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God. 
JHN.1.13	They are reborn—not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.
JHN.1.14	So the Word became human
JHN.1.15	John testified about him when he shouted to the crowds, “This is the one I was talking about when I said, ‘Someone is coming after me who is far greater than I am, for he existed long before me.’”
JHN.1.16	From his abundance we have all received one gracious blessing after another.
JHN.1.17	For the law was given through Moses, but God’s unfailing love and faithfulness came through Jesus Christ. 
JHN.1.18	No one has ever seen God. But the unique One, who is himself God,
JHN.1.19	This was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Temple assistants
JHN.1.20	He came right out and said, “I am not the Messiah.”
JHN.1.21	“Well then, who are you?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?”
JHN.1.21	“No,” he replied.
JHN.1.21	“Are you the Prophet we are expecting?”
JHN.1.21	“No.”
JHN.1.22	“Then who are you? We need an answer for those who sent us. What do you have to say about yourself?”
JHN.1.23	John replied in the words of the prophet Isaiah: 
JHN.1.23	“I am a voice shouting in the wilderness,
JHN.1.23	‘Clear the way for the 
JHN.1.24	Then the Pharisees who had been sent 
JHN.1.25	asked him, “If you aren’t the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet, what right do you have to baptize?”
JHN.1.26	John told them, “I baptize with
JHN.1.27	Though his ministry follows mine, I’m not even worthy to be his slave and untie the straps of his sandal.”
JHN.1.28	This encounter took place in Bethany, an area east of the Jordan River, where John was baptizing.
JHN.1.29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! 
JHN.1.30	He is the one I was talking about when I said, ‘A man is coming after me who is far greater than I am, for he existed long before me.’ 
JHN.1.31	I did not recognize him as the Messiah, but I have been baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel.”
JHN.1.32	Then John testified, “I saw the Holy Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and resting upon him. 
JHN.1.33	I didn’t know he was the one, but when God sent me to baptize with water, he told me, ‘The one on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ 
JHN.1.34	I saw this happen to Jesus, so I testify that he is the Chosen One of God.
JHN.1.35	The following day John was again standing with two of his disciples. 
JHN.1.36	As Jesus walked by, John looked at him and declared, “Look! There is the Lamb of God!” 
JHN.1.37	When John’s two disciples heard this, they followed Jesus.
JHN.1.38	Jesus looked around and saw them following. 
JHN.1.38	They replied, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”
JHN.1.39	 he said. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon when they went with him to the place where he was staying, and they remained with him the rest of the day.
JHN.1.40	Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of these men who heard what John said and then followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.41	Andrew went to find his brother, Simon, and told him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means “Christ”
JHN.1.42	Then Andrew brought Simon to meet Jesus. Looking intently at Simon, Jesus said, 
JHN.1.43	The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, 
JHN.1.44	Philip was from Bethsaida, Andrew and Peter’s hometown.
JHN.1.45	Philip went to look for Nathanael and told him, “We have found the very person Moses
JHN.1.46	“Nazareth!” exclaimed Nathanael. “Can anything good come from Nazareth?”
JHN.1.46	“Come and see for yourself,” Philip replied.
JHN.1.47	As they approached, Jesus said, 
JHN.1.48	“How do you know about me?” Nathanael asked.
JHN.1.48	Jesus replied, 
JHN.1.49	Then Nathanael exclaimed, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God—the King of Israel!”
JHN.1.50	Jesus asked him, 
JHN.1.51	Then he said, 
JHN.2.1	The next day
JHN.2.2	and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the celebration. 
JHN.2.3	The wine supply ran out during the festivities, so Jesus’ mother told him, “They have no more wine.”
JHN.2.4	 Jesus replied. 
JHN.2.5	But his mother told the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
JHN.2.6	Standing nearby were six stone water jars, used for Jewish ceremonial washing. Each could hold twenty to thirty gallons.
JHN.2.7	Jesus told the servants, 
JHN.2.8	he said, 
JHN.2.9	When the master of ceremonies tasted the water that was now wine, not knowing where it had come from (though, of course, the servants knew), he called the bridegroom over. 
JHN.2.10	“A host always serves the best wine first,” he said. “Then, when everyone has had a lot to drink, he brings out the less expensive wine. But you have kept the best until now!”
JHN.2.11	This miraculous sign at Cana in Galilee was the first time Jesus revealed his glory. And his disciples believed in him.
JHN.2.12	After the wedding he went to Capernaum for a few days with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples.
JHN.2.13	It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover celebration, so Jesus went to Jerusalem. 
JHN.2.14	In the Temple area he saw merchants selling cattle, sheep, and doves for sacrifices; he also saw dealers at tables exchanging foreign money. 
JHN.2.15	Jesus made a whip from some ropes and chased them all out of the Temple. He drove out the sheep and cattle, scattered the money changers’ coins over the floor, and turned over their tables. 
JHN.2.16	Then, going over to the people who sold doves, he told them, 
JHN.2.17	Then his disciples remembered this prophecy from the Scriptures: “Passion for God’s house will consume me.”
JHN.2.18	But the Jewish leaders demanded, “What are you doing? If God gave you authority to do this, show us a miraculous sign to prove it.”
JHN.2.19	 Jesus replied. 
JHN.2.20	“What!” they exclaimed. “It has taken forty-six years to build this Temple, and you can rebuild it in three days?” 
JHN.2.21	But when Jesus said “this temple,” he meant his own body. 
JHN.2.22	After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered he had said this, and they believed both the Scriptures and what Jesus had said.
JHN.2.23	Because of the miraculous signs Jesus did in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration, many began to trust in him. 
JHN.2.24	But Jesus didn’t trust them, because he knew all about people. 
JHN.2.25	No one needed to tell him about human nature, for he knew what was in each person’s heart.
JHN.3.1	There was a man named Nicodemus, a Jewish religious leader who was a Pharisee. 
JHN.3.2	After dark one evening, he came to speak with Jesus. “Rabbi,” he said, “we all know that God has sent you to teach us. Your miraculous signs are evidence that God is with you.”
JHN.3.3	Jesus replied, 
JHN.3.4	“What do you mean?” exclaimed Nicodemus. “How can an old man go back into his mother’s womb and be born again?”
JHN.3.5	Jesus replied, 
JHN.3.9	“How are these things possible?” Nicodemus asked.
JHN.3.10	Jesus replied, 
JHN.3.22	Then Jesus and his disciples left Jerusalem and went into the Judean countryside. Jesus spent some time with them there, baptizing people.
JHN.3.23	At this time John the Baptist was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there; and people kept coming to him for baptism. 
JHN.3.24	(This was before John was thrown into prison.) 
JHN.3.25	A debate broke out between John’s disciples and a certain Jew
JHN.3.26	So John’s disciples came to him and said, “Rabbi, the man you met on the other side of the Jordan River, the one you identified as the Messiah, is also baptizing people. And everybody is going to him instead of coming to us.”
JHN.3.27	John replied, “No one can receive anything unless God gives it from heaven. 
JHN.3.28	You yourselves know how plainly I told you, ‘I am not the Messiah. I am only here to prepare the way for him.’ 
JHN.3.29	It is the bridegroom who marries the bride, and the bridegroom’s friend is simply glad to stand with him and hear his vows. Therefore, I am filled with joy at his success. 
JHN.3.30	He must become greater and greater, and I must become less and less.
JHN.3.31	“He has come from above and is greater than anyone else. We are of the earth, and we speak of earthly things, but he has come from heaven and is greater than anyone else.
JHN.3.32	He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but how few believe what he tells them! 
JHN.3.33	Anyone who accepts his testimony can affirm that God is true. 
JHN.3.34	For he is sent by God. He speaks God’s words, for God gives him the Spirit without limit. 
JHN.3.35	The Father loves his Son and has put everything into his hands. 
JHN.3.36	And anyone who believes in God’s Son has eternal life. Anyone who doesn’t obey the Son will never experience eternal life but remains under God’s angry judgment.”
JHN.4.1	Jesus
JHN.4.2	(though Jesus himself didn’t baptize them—his disciples did). 
JHN.4.3	So he left Judea and returned to Galilee.
JHN.4.4	He had to go through Samaria on the way. 
JHN.4.5	Eventually he came to the Samaritan village of Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
JHN.4.6	Jacob’s well was there; and Jesus, tired from the long walk, sat wearily beside the well about noontime. 
JHN.4.7	Soon a Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.8	He was alone at the time because his disciples had gone into the village to buy some food.
JHN.4.9	The woman was surprised, for Jews refuse to have anything to do with Samaritans.
JHN.4.10	Jesus replied, 
JHN.4.11	“But sir, you don’t have a rope or a bucket,” she said, “and this well is very deep. Where would you get this living water? 
JHN.4.12	And besides, do you think you’re greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us this well? How can you offer better water than he and his sons and his animals enjoyed?”
JHN.4.13	Jesus replied, 
JHN.4.15	“Please, sir,” the woman said, “give me this water! Then I’ll never be thirsty again, and I won’t have to come here to get water.”
JHN.4.16	 Jesus told her.
JHN.4.17	“I don’t have a husband,” the woman replied.
JHN.4.17	Jesus said, 
JHN.4.19	“Sir,” the woman said, “you must be a prophet. 
JHN.4.20	So tell me, why is it that you Jews insist that Jerusalem is the only place of worship, while we Samaritans claim it is here at Mount Gerizim,
JHN.4.21	Jesus replied, 
JHN.4.25	The woman said, “I know the Messiah is coming—the one who is called Christ. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.”
JHN.4.26	Then Jesus told her, 
JHN.4.27	Just then his disciples came back. They were shocked to find him talking to a woman, but none of them had the nerve to ask, “What do you want with her?” or “Why are you talking to her?” 
JHN.4.28	The woman left her water jar beside the well and ran back to the village, telling everyone, 
JHN.4.29	“Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did! Could he possibly be the Messiah?” 
JHN.4.30	So the people came streaming from the village to see him.
JHN.4.31	Meanwhile, the disciples were urging Jesus, “Rabbi, eat something.”
JHN.4.32	But Jesus replied, 
JHN.4.33	“Did someone bring him food while we were gone?” the disciples asked each other.
JHN.4.34	Then Jesus explained: 
JHN.4.39	Many Samaritans from the village believed in Jesus because the woman had said, “He told me everything I ever did!” 
JHN.4.40	When they came out to see him, they begged him to stay in their village. So he stayed for two days, 
JHN.4.41	long enough for many more to hear his message and believe. 
JHN.4.42	Then they said to the woman, “Now we believe, not just because of what you told us, but because we have heard him ourselves. Now we know that he is indeed the Savior of the world.”
JHN.4.43	At the end of the two days, Jesus went on to Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	He himself had said that a prophet is not honored in his own hometown. 
JHN.4.45	Yet the Galileans welcomed him, for they had been in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration and had seen everything he did there.
JHN.4.46	As he traveled through Galilee, he came to Cana, where he had turned the water into wine. There was a government official in nearby Capernaum whose son was very sick. 
JHN.4.47	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Jesus to come to Capernaum to heal his son, who was about to die.
JHN.4.48	Jesus asked, 
JHN.4.49	The official pleaded, “Lord, please come now before my little boy dies.”
JHN.4.50	Then Jesus told him, 
JHN.4.51	While the man was on his way, some of his servants met him with the news that his son was alive and well. 
JHN.4.52	He asked them when the boy had begun to get better, and they replied, “Yesterday afternoon at one o’clock his fever suddenly disappeared!” 
JHN.4.53	Then the father realized that that was the very time Jesus had told him, 
JHN.4.54	This was the second miraculous sign Jesus did in Galilee after coming from Judea.
JHN.5.1	Afterward Jesus returned to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish holy days. 
JHN.5.2	Inside the city, near the Sheep Gate, was the pool of Bethesda,
JHN.5.3	Crowds of sick people—blind, lame, or paralyzed—lay on the porches.
JHN.5.5	One of the men lying there had been sick for thirty-eight years. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him and knew he had been ill for a long time, he asked him, 
JHN.5.7	“I can’t, sir,” the sick man said, “for I have no one to put me into the pool when the water bubbles up. Someone else always gets there ahead of me.”
JHN.5.8	Jesus told him, 
JHN.5.9	Instantly, the man was healed! He rolled up his sleeping mat and began walking! But this miracle happened on the Sabbath, 
JHN.5.10	so the Jewish leaders objected. They said to the man who was cured, “You can’t work on the Sabbath! The law doesn’t allow you to carry that sleeping mat!”
JHN.5.11	But he replied, “The man who healed me told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”
JHN.5.12	“Who said such a thing as that?” they demanded.
JHN.5.13	The man didn’t know, for Jesus had disappeared into the crowd. 
JHN.5.14	But afterward Jesus found him in the Temple and told him, 
JHN.5.15	Then the man went and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had healed him.
JHN.5.16	So the Jewish leaders began harassing
JHN.5.17	But Jesus replied, 
JHN.5.18	So the Jewish leaders tried all the harder to find a way to kill him. For he not only broke the Sabbath, he called God his Father, thereby making himself equal with God.
JHN.5.19	So Jesus explained, 
JHN.6.1	After this, Jesus crossed over to the far side of the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias. 
JHN.6.2	A huge crowd kept following him wherever he went, because they saw his miraculous signs as he healed the sick. 
JHN.6.3	Then Jesus climbed a hill and sat down with his disciples around him. 
JHN.6.4	(It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover celebration.) 
JHN.6.5	Jesus soon saw a huge crowd of people coming to look for him. Turning to Philip, he asked, 
JHN.6.6	He was testing Philip, for he already knew what he was going to do.
JHN.6.7	Philip replied, “Even if we worked for months, we wouldn’t have enough money
JHN.6.8	Then Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up. 
JHN.6.9	“There’s a young boy here with five barley loaves and two fish. But what good is that with this huge crowd?”
JHN.6.10	 Jesus said. So they all sat down on the grassy slopes. (The men alone numbered about 5,000.) 
JHN.6.11	Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks to God, and distributed them to the people. Afterward he did the same with the fish. And they all ate as much as they wanted. 
JHN.6.12	After everyone was full, Jesus told his disciples, 
JHN.6.13	So they picked up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with scraps left by the people who had eaten from the five barley loaves.
JHN.6.14	When the people saw him
JHN.6.15	When Jesus saw that they were ready to force him to be their king, he slipped away into the hills by himself.
JHN.6.16	That evening Jesus’ disciples went down to the shore to wait for him. 
JHN.6.17	But as darkness fell and Jesus still hadn’t come back, they got into the boat and headed across the lake toward Capernaum. 
JHN.6.18	Soon a gale swept down upon them, and the sea grew very rough. 
JHN.6.19	They had rowed three or four miles
JHN.6.20	but he called out to them, 
JHN.6.21	Then they were eager to let him in the boat, and immediately they arrived at their destination!
JHN.6.22	The next day the crowd that had stayed on the far shore saw that the disciples had taken the only boat, and they realized Jesus had not gone with them. 
JHN.6.23	Several boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the Lord had blessed the bread and the people had eaten. 
JHN.6.24	So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went across to Capernaum to look for him. 
JHN.6.25	They found him on the other side of the lake and asked, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”
JHN.6.26	Jesus replied, 
JHN.6.28	They replied, “We want to perform God’s works, too. What should we do?”
JHN.6.29	Jesus told them, 
JHN.6.30	They answered, “Show us a miraculous sign if you want us to believe in you. What can you do? 
JHN.6.31	After all, our ancestors ate manna while they journeyed through the wilderness! The Scriptures say, ‘Moses gave them bread from heaven to eat.’
JHN.6.32	Jesus said, 
JHN.6.34	“Sir,” they said, “give us that bread every day.”
JHN.6.35	Jesus replied, 
JHN.6.41	Then the people
JHN.6.42	They said, “Isn’t this Jesus, the son of Joseph? We know his father and mother. How can he say, ‘I came down from heaven’?”
JHN.6.43	But Jesus replied, 
JHN.6.52	Then the people began arguing with each other about what he meant. “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” they asked.
JHN.6.53	So Jesus said again, 
JHN.6.59	He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	Many of his disciples said, “This is very hard to understand. How can anyone accept it?”
JHN.6.61	Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining, so he said to them, 
JHN.6.64	 (For Jesus knew from the beginning which ones didn’t believe, and he knew who would betray him.) 
JHN.6.65	Then he said, 
JHN.6.66	At this point many of his disciples turned away and deserted him. 
JHN.6.67	Then Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked, 
JHN.6.68	Simon Peter replied, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words that give eternal life. 
JHN.6.69	We believe, and we know you are the Holy One of God.
JHN.6.70	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.6.71	He was speaking of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, one of the Twelve, who would later betray him.
JHN.7.1	After this, Jesus traveled around Galilee. He wanted to stay out of Judea, where the Jewish leaders were plotting his death. 
JHN.7.2	But soon it was time for the Jewish Festival of Shelters, 
JHN.7.3	and Jesus’ brothers said to him, “Leave here and go to Judea, where your followers can see your miracles! 
JHN.7.4	You can’t become famous if you hide like this! If you can do such wonderful things, show yourself to the world!” 
JHN.7.5	For even his brothers didn’t believe in him.
JHN.7.6	Jesus replied, 
JHN.7.9	After saying these things, Jesus remained in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	But after his brothers left for the festival, Jesus also went, though secretly, staying out of public view. 
JHN.7.11	The Jewish leaders tried to find him at the festival and kept asking if anyone had seen him. 
JHN.7.12	There was a lot of grumbling about him among the crowds. Some argued, “He’s a good man,” but others said, “He’s nothing but a fraud who deceives the people.” 
JHN.7.13	But no one had the courage to speak favorably about him in public, for they were afraid of getting in trouble with the Jewish leaders.
JHN.7.14	Then, midway through the festival, Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach. 
JHN.7.15	The people
JHN.7.16	So Jesus told them, 
JHN.7.20	The crowd replied, “You’re demon possessed! Who’s trying to kill you?”
JHN.7.21	Jesus replied, 
JHN.7.25	Some of the people who lived in Jerusalem started to ask each other, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill? 
JHN.7.26	But here he is, speaking in public, and they say nothing to him. Could our leaders possibly believe that he is the Messiah? 
JHN.7.27	But how could he be? For we know where this man comes from. When the Messiah comes, he will simply appear; no one will know where he comes from.”
JHN.7.28	While Jesus was teaching in the Temple, he called out, 
JHN.7.30	Then the leaders tried to arrest him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his time
JHN.7.31	Many among the crowds at the Temple believed in him. “After all,” they said, “would you expect the Messiah to do more miraculous signs than this man has done?”
JHN.7.32	When the Pharisees heard that the crowds were whispering such things, they and the leading priests sent Temple guards to arrest Jesus. 
JHN.7.33	But Jesus told them, 
JHN.7.35	The Jewish leaders were puzzled by this statement. “Where is he planning to go?” they asked. “Is he thinking of leaving the country and going to the Jews in other lands?
JHN.7.36	What does he mean when he says, ‘You will search for me but not find me,’ and ‘You cannot go where I am going’?”
JHN.7.37	On the last day, the climax of the festival, Jesus stood and shouted to the crowds, 
JHN.7.39	(When he said “living water,” he was speaking of the Spirit, who would be given to everyone believing in him. But the Spirit had not yet been given,
JHN.7.40	When the crowds heard him say this, some of them declared, “Surely this man is the Prophet we’ve been expecting.”
JHN.7.41	Others said, “He is the Messiah.” Still others said, “But he can’t be! Will the Messiah come from Galilee? 
JHN.7.42	For the Scriptures clearly state that the Messiah will be born of the royal line of David, in Bethlehem, the village where King David was born.”
JHN.7.43	So the crowd was divided about him. 
JHN.7.44	Some even wanted him arrested, but no one laid a hand on him.
JHN.7.45	When the Temple guards returned without having arrested Jesus, the leading priests and Pharisees demanded, “Why didn’t you bring him in?”
JHN.7.46	“We have never heard anyone speak like this!” the guards responded.
JHN.7.47	“Have you been led astray, too?” the Pharisees mocked. 
JHN.7.48	“Is there a single one of us rulers or Pharisees who believes in him? 
JHN.7.49	This foolish crowd follows him, but they are ignorant of the law. God’s curse is on them!”
JHN.7.50	Then Nicodemus, the leader who had met with Jesus earlier, spoke up. 
JHN.7.51	“Is it legal to convict a man before he is given a hearing?” he asked.
JHN.7.52	They replied, “Are you from Galilee, too? Search the Scriptures and see for yourself—no prophet ever comes
JHN.7.52	----------
JHN.7.52	[
JHN.7.53	Then the meeting broke up, and everybody went home.
JHN.8.1	Jesus returned to the Mount of Olives, 
JHN.8.2	but early the next morning he was back again at the Temple. A crowd soon gathered, and he sat down and taught them. 
JHN.8.3	As he was speaking, the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery. They put her in front of the crowd.
JHN.8.4	“Teacher,” they said to Jesus, “this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 
JHN.8.5	The law of Moses says to stone her. What do you say?”
JHN.8.6	They were trying to trap him into saying something they could use against him, but Jesus stooped down and wrote in the dust with his finger. 
JHN.8.7	They kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, 
JHN.8.8	Then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust.
JHN.8.9	When the accusers heard this, they slipped away one by one, beginning with the oldest, until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman. 
JHN.8.10	Then Jesus stood up again and said to the woman, 
JHN.8.11	“No, Lord,” she said.
JHN.8.11	And Jesus said, 
JHN.8.11	----------
JHN.8.12	Jesus spoke to the people once more and said, 
JHN.8.13	The Pharisees replied, “You are making those claims about yourself! Such testimony is not valid.”
JHN.8.14	Jesus told them, 
JHN.8.19	“Where is your father?” they asked.
JHN.8.19	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.20	Jesus made these statements while he was teaching in the section of the Temple known as the Treasury. But he was not arrested, because his time
JHN.8.21	Later Jesus said to them again, 
JHN.8.22	The people
JHN.8.23	Jesus continued, 
JHN.8.25	“Who are you?” they demanded.
JHN.8.25	Jesus replied, 
JHN.8.27	But they still didn’t understand that he was talking about his Father.
JHN.8.28	So Jesus said, 
JHN.8.30	Then many who heard him say these things believed in him.
JHN.8.31	Jesus said to the people who believed in him, 
JHN.8.33	“But we are descendants of Abraham,” they said. “We have never been slaves to anyone. What do you mean, ‘You will be set free’?”
JHN.8.34	Jesus replied, 
JHN.8.39	“Our father is Abraham!” they declared.
JHN.8.39	 Jesus replied, 
JHN.8.41	They replied, “We aren’t illegitimate children! God himself is our true Father.”
JHN.8.42	Jesus told them, 
JHN.8.48	The people retorted, “You Samaritan devil! Didn’t we say all along that you were possessed by a demon?”
JHN.8.49	 Jesus said, 
JHN.8.52	The people said, “Now we know you are possessed by a demon. Even Abraham and the prophets died, but you say, ‘Anyone who obeys my teaching will never die!’ 
JHN.8.53	Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.57	The people said, “You aren’t even fifty years old. How can you say you have seen Abraham?
JHN.8.58	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.59	At that point they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus was hidden from them and left the Temple.
JHN.9.1	As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth. 
JHN.9.2	“Rabbi,” his disciples asked him, “why was this man born blind? Was it because of his own sins or his parents’ sins?”
JHN.9.3	 Jesus answered. 
JHN.9.6	Then he spit on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and spread the mud over the blind man’s eyes. 
JHN.9.7	He told him, 
JHN.9.8	His neighbors and others who knew him as a blind beggar asked each other, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?” 
JHN.9.9	Some said he was, and others said, “No, he just looks like him!”
JHN.9.9	But the beggar kept saying, “Yes, I am the same one!”
JHN.9.10	They asked, “Who healed you? What happened?”
JHN.9.11	He told them, “The man they call Jesus made mud and spread it over my eyes and told me, ‘Go to the pool of Siloam and wash yourself.’ So I went and washed, and now I can see!”
JHN.9.12	“Where is he now?” they asked.
JHN.9.12	“I don’t know,” he replied.
JHN.9.13	Then they took the man who had been blind to the Pharisees, 
JHN.9.14	because it was on the Sabbath that Jesus had made the mud and healed him. 
JHN.9.15	The Pharisees asked the man all about it. So he told them, “He put the mud over my eyes, and when I washed it away, I could see!”
JHN.9.16	Some of the Pharisees said, “This man Jesus is not from God, for he is working on the Sabbath.” Others said, “But how could an ordinary sinner do such miraculous signs?” So there was a deep division of opinion among them.
JHN.9.17	Then the Pharisees again questioned the man who had been blind and demanded, “What’s your opinion about this man who healed you?”
JHN.9.17	The man replied, “I think he must be a prophet.”
JHN.9.18	The Jewish leaders still refused to believe the man had been blind and could now see, so they called in his parents. 
JHN.9.19	They asked them, “Is this your son? Was he born blind? If so, how can he now see?”
JHN.9.20	His parents replied, “We know this is our son and that he was born blind, 
JHN.9.21	but we don’t know how he can see or who healed him. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.” 
JHN.9.22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who had announced that anyone saying Jesus was the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue. 
JHN.9.23	That’s why they said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”
JHN.9.24	So for the second time they called in the man who had been blind and told him, “God should get the glory for this,
JHN.9.25	“I don’t know whether he is a sinner,” the man replied. “But I know this: I was blind, and now I can see!”
JHN.9.26	“But what did he do?” they asked. “How did he heal you?”
JHN.9.27	“Look!” the man exclaimed. “I told you once. Didn’t you listen? Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?”
JHN.9.28	Then they cursed him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses! 
JHN.9.29	We know God spoke to Moses, but we don’t even know where this man comes from.”
JHN.9.30	“Why, that’s very strange!” the man replied. “He healed my eyes, and yet you don’t know where he comes from? 
JHN.9.31	We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but he is ready to hear those who worship him and do his will. 
JHN.9.32	Ever since the world began, no one has been able to open the eyes of someone born blind. 
JHN.9.33	If this man were not from God, he couldn’t have done it.”
JHN.9.34	“You were born a total sinner!” they answered. “Are you trying to teach us?” And they threw him out of the synagogue.
JHN.9.35	When Jesus heard what had happened, he found the man and asked, 
JHN.9.36	The man answered, “Who is he, sir? I want to believe in him.”
JHN.9.37	 Jesus said, 
JHN.9.38	“Yes, Lord, I believe!” the man said. And he worshiped Jesus.
JHN.9.39	Then Jesus told him,
JHN.9.40	Some Pharisees who were standing nearby heard him and asked, “Are you saying we’re blind?”
JHN.9.41	 Jesus replied. 
JHN.10.6	Those who heard Jesus use this illustration didn’t understand what he meant, 
JHN.10.7	so he explained it to them: 
JHN.10.19	When he said these things, the people
JHN.10.20	Some said, “He’s demon possessed and out of his mind. Why listen to a man like that?” 
JHN.10.21	Others said, “This doesn’t sound like a man possessed by a demon! Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
JHN.10.22	It was now winter, and Jesus was in Jerusalem at the time of Hanukkah, the Festival of Dedication. 
JHN.10.23	He was in the Temple, walking through the section known as Solomon’s Colonnade. 
JHN.10.24	The people surrounded him and asked, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”
JHN.10.25	Jesus replied, 
JHN.10.31	Once again the people picked up stones to kill him. 
JHN.10.32	Jesus said, 
JHN.10.33	They replied, “We’re stoning you not for any good work, but for blasphemy! You, a mere man, claim to be God.”
JHN.10.34	Jesus replied, 
JHN.10.39	Once again they tried to arrest him, but he got away and left them. 
JHN.10.40	He went beyond the Jordan River near the place where John was first baptizing and stayed there awhile. 
JHN.10.41	And many followed him. “John didn’t perform miraculous signs,” they remarked to one another, “but everything he said about this man has come true.” 
JHN.10.42	And many who were there believed in Jesus.
JHN.11.1	A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany with his sisters, Mary and Martha. 
JHN.11.2	This is the Mary who later poured the expensive perfume on the Lord’s feet and wiped them with her hair.
JHN.11.3	So the two sisters sent a message to Jesus telling him, “Lord, your dear friend is very sick.”
JHN.11.4	But when Jesus heard about it he said, 
JHN.11.5	So although Jesus loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, 
JHN.11.6	he stayed where he was for the next two days. 
JHN.11.7	Finally, he said to his disciples, 
JHN.11.8	But his disciples objected. “Rabbi,” they said, “only a few days ago the people
JHN.11.9	Jesus replied, 
JHN.11.11	Then he said, 
JHN.11.12	The disciples said, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will soon get better!” 
JHN.11.13	They thought Jesus meant Lazarus was simply sleeping, but Jesus meant Lazarus had died.
JHN.11.14	So he told them plainly, 
JHN.11.16	Thomas, nicknamed the Twin,
JHN.11.17	When Jesus arrived at Bethany, he was told that Lazarus had already been in his grave for four days. 
JHN.11.18	Bethany was only a few miles
JHN.11.19	and many of the people had come to console Martha and Mary in their loss. 
JHN.11.20	When Martha got word that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary stayed in the house. 
JHN.11.21	Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
JHN.11.22	But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask.”
JHN.11.23	Jesus told her, 
JHN.11.24	“Yes,” Martha said, “he will rise when everyone else rises, at the last day.”
JHN.11.25	Jesus told her, 
JHN.11.27	“Yes, Lord,” she told him. “I have always believed you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who has come into the world from God.” 
JHN.11.28	Then she returned to Mary. She called Mary aside from the mourners and told her, “The Teacher is here and wants to see you.” 
JHN.11.29	So Mary immediately went to him.
JHN.11.30	Jesus had stayed outside the village, at the place where Martha met him. 
JHN.11.31	When the people who were at the house consoling Mary saw her leave so hastily, they assumed she was going to Lazarus’s grave to weep. So they followed her there. 
JHN.11.32	When Mary arrived and saw Jesus, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
JHN.11.33	When Jesus saw her weeping and saw the other people wailing with her, a deep anger welled up within him,
JHN.11.34	 he asked them.
JHN.11.34	They told him, “Lord, come and see.” 
JHN.11.35	Then Jesus wept. 
JHN.11.36	The people who were standing nearby said, “See how much he loved him!” 
JHN.11.37	But some said, “This man healed a blind man. Couldn’t he have kept Lazarus from dying?”
JHN.11.38	Jesus was still angry as he arrived at the tomb, a cave with a stone rolled across its entrance. 
JHN.11.39	 Jesus told them.
JHN.11.39	But Martha, the dead man’s sister, protested, “Lord, he has been dead for four days. The smell will be terrible.”
JHN.11.40	Jesus responded, 
JHN.11.41	So they rolled the stone aside. Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, 
JHN.11.43	Then Jesus shouted, 
JHN.11.44	And the dead man came out, his hands and feet bound in graveclothes, his face wrapped in a headcloth. Jesus told them, 
JHN.11.45	Many of the people who were with Mary believed in Jesus when they saw this happen. 
JHN.11.46	But some went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 
JHN.11.47	Then the leading priests and Pharisees called the high council
JHN.11.48	If we allow him to go on like this, soon everyone will believe in him. Then the Roman army will come and destroy both our Temple
JHN.11.49	Caiaphas, who was high priest at that time,
JHN.11.50	You don’t realize that it’s better for you that one man should die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed.”
JHN.11.51	He did not say this on his own; as high priest at that time he was led to prophesy that Jesus would die for the entire nation. 
JHN.11.52	And not only for that nation, but to bring together and unite all the children of God scattered around the world.
JHN.11.53	So from that time on, the Jewish leaders began to plot Jesus’ death. 
JHN.11.54	As a result, Jesus stopped his public ministry among the people and left Jerusalem. He went to a place near the wilderness, to the village of Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.
JHN.11.55	It was now almost time for the Jewish Passover celebration, and many people from all over the country arrived in Jerusalem several days early so they could go through the purification ceremony before Passover began. 
JHN.11.56	They kept looking for Jesus, but as they stood around in the Temple, they said to each other, “What do you think? He won’t come for Passover, will he?” 
JHN.11.57	Meanwhile, the leading priests and Pharisees had publicly ordered that anyone seeing Jesus must report it immediately so they could arrest him.
JHN.12.1	Six days before the Passover celebration began, Jesus arrived in Bethany, the home of Lazarus—the man he had raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.2	A dinner was prepared in Jesus’ honor. Martha served, and Lazarus was among those who ate
JHN.12.3	Then Mary took a twelve-ounce jar
JHN.12.4	But Judas Iscariot, the disciple who would soon betray him, said, 
JHN.12.5	“That perfume was worth a year’s wages.
JHN.12.6	Not that he cared for the poor—he was a thief, and since he was in charge of the disciples’ money, he often stole some for himself.
JHN.12.7	Jesus replied, 
JHN.12.9	When all the people
JHN.12.10	Then the leading priests decided to kill Lazarus, too, 
JHN.12.11	for it was because of him that many of the people had deserted them
JHN.12.12	The next day, the news that Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem swept through the city. A large crowd of Passover visitors 
JHN.12.13	took palm branches and went down the road to meet him. They shouted, 
JHN.12.13	“Praise God!
JHN.12.13	Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the 
JHN.12.13	Hail to the King of Israel!”
JHN.12.14	Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it, fulfilling the prophecy that said:
JHN.12.15	“Don’t be afraid, people of Jerusalem.
JHN.12.15	Look, your King is coming,
JHN.12.15	riding on a donkey’s colt.”
JHN.12.16	His disciples didn’t understand at the time that this was a fulfillment of prophecy. But after Jesus entered into his glory, they remembered what had happened and realized that these things had been written about him.
JHN.12.17	Many in the crowd had seen Jesus call Lazarus from the tomb, raising him from the dead, and they were telling others
JHN.12.18	That was the reason so many went out to meet him—because they had heard about this miraculous sign. 
JHN.12.19	Then the Pharisees said to each other, “There’s nothing we can do. Look, everyone
JHN.12.20	Some Greeks who had come to Jerusalem for the Passover celebration 
JHN.12.21	paid a visit to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee. They said, “Sir, we want to meet Jesus.” 
JHN.12.22	Philip told Andrew about it, and they went together to ask Jesus.
JHN.12.23	Jesus replied, 
JHN.12.28	Then a voice spoke from heaven, saying, “I have already brought glory to my name, and I will do so again.” 
JHN.12.29	When the crowd heard the voice, some thought it was thunder, while others declared an angel had spoken to him.
JHN.12.30	Then Jesus told them, 
JHN.12.33	He said this to indicate how he was going to die.
JHN.12.34	The crowd responded, “We understood from Scripture
JHN.12.35	Jesus replied, 
JHN.12.36	After saying these things, Jesus went away and was hidden from them.
JHN.12.37	But despite all the miraculous signs Jesus had done, most of the people still did not believe in him. 
JHN.12.38	This is exactly what Isaiah the prophet had predicted: 
JHN.12.38	“
JHN.12.38	To whom has the 
JHN.12.39	But the people couldn’t believe, for as Isaiah also said,
JHN.12.40	“The Lord has blinded their eyes
JHN.12.40	and hardened their hearts—
JHN.12.40	so that their eyes cannot see,
JHN.12.40	and their hearts cannot understand,
JHN.12.40	and they cannot turn to me
JHN.12.40	and have me heal them.”
JHN.12.41	Isaiah was referring to Jesus when he said this, because he saw the future and spoke of the Messiah’s glory. 
JHN.12.42	Many people did believe in him, however, including some of the Jewish leaders. But they wouldn’t admit it for fear that the Pharisees would expel them from the synagogue. 
JHN.12.43	For they loved human praise more than the praise of God.
JHN.12.44	Jesus shouted to the crowds, 
JHN.13.1	Before the Passover celebration, Jesus knew that his hour had come to leave this world and return to his Father. He had loved his disciples during his ministry on earth, and now he loved them to the very end.
JHN.13.2	It was time for supper, and the devil had already prompted Judas,
JHN.13.3	Jesus knew that the Father had given him authority over everything and that he had come from God and would return to God. 
JHN.13.4	So he got up from the table, took off his robe, wrapped a towel around his waist, 
JHN.13.5	and poured water into a basin. Then he began to wash the disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel he had around him.
JHN.13.6	When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”
JHN.13.7	Jesus replied, 
JHN.13.8	“No,” Peter protested, “you will never ever wash my feet!”
JHN.13.8	Jesus replied, 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter exclaimed, “Then wash my hands and head as well, Lord, not just my feet!”
JHN.13.10	Jesus replied, 
JHN.13.11	For Jesus knew who would betray him. That is what he meant when he said, 
JHN.13.12	After washing their feet, he put on his robe again and sat down and asked, 
JHN.13.21	Now Jesus was deeply troubled,
JHN.13.22	The disciples looked at each other, wondering whom he could mean. 
JHN.13.23	The disciple Jesus loved was sitting next to Jesus at the table.
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter motioned to him to ask, “Who’s he talking about?” 
JHN.13.25	So that disciple leaned over to Jesus and asked, “Lord, who is it?”
JHN.13.26	Jesus responded, 
JHN.13.27	When Judas had eaten the bread, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus told him, 
JHN.13.28	None of the others at the table knew what Jesus meant. 
JHN.13.29	Since Judas was their treasurer, some thought Jesus was telling him to go and pay for the food or to give some money to the poor. 
JHN.13.30	So Judas left at once, going out into the night.
JHN.13.31	As soon as Judas left the room, Jesus said, 
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter asked, “Lord, where are you going?”
JHN.13.36	And Jesus replied, 
JHN.13.37	“But why can’t I come now, Lord?” he asked. “I’m ready to die for you.”
JHN.13.38	Jesus answered, 
JHN.14.5	“No, we don’t know, Lord,” Thomas said. “We have no idea where you are going, so how can we know the way?”
JHN.14.6	Jesus told him, 
JHN.14.8	Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.”
JHN.14.9	Jesus replied, 
JHN.14.22	Judas (not Judas Iscariot, but the other disciple with that name) said to him, “Lord, why are you going to reveal yourself only to us and not to the world at large?”
JHN.14.23	Jesus replied, 
JHN.16.17	Some of the disciples asked each other, “What does he mean when he says, ‘In a little while you won’t see me, but then you will see me,’ and ‘I am going to the Father’? 
JHN.16.18	And what does he mean by ‘a little while’? We don’t understand.”
JHN.16.19	Jesus realized they wanted to ask him about it, so he said, 
JHN.16.29	Then his disciples said, “At last you are speaking plainly and not figuratively. 
JHN.16.30	Now we understand that you know everything, and there’s no need to question you. From this we believe that you came from God.”
JHN.16.31	Jesus asked, 
JHN.17.1	After saying all these things, Jesus looked up to heaven and said, 
JHN.18.1	After saying these things, Jesus crossed the Kidron Valley with his disciples and entered a grove of olive trees. 
JHN.18.2	Judas, the betrayer, knew this place, because Jesus had often gone there with his disciples. 
JHN.18.3	The leading priests and Pharisees had given Judas a contingent of Roman soldiers and Temple guards to accompany him. Now with blazing torches, lanterns, and weapons, they arrived at the olive grove.
JHN.18.4	Jesus fully realized all that was going to happen to him, so he stepped forward to meet them. 
JHN.18.5	“Jesus the Nazarene,”
JHN.18.5	 Jesus said. (Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.) 
JHN.18.6	As Jesus said 
JHN.18.7	Once more he asked them, 
JHN.18.7	And again they replied, “Jesus the Nazarene.”
JHN.18.8	 Jesus said. 
JHN.18.9	He did this to fulfill his own statement: 
JHN.18.10	Then Simon Peter drew a sword and slashed off the right ear of Malchus, the high priest’s slave. 
JHN.18.11	But Jesus said to Peter, 
JHN.18.12	So the soldiers, their commanding officer, and the Temple guards arrested Jesus and tied him up. 
JHN.18.13	First they took him to Annas, since he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest at that time.
JHN.18.14	Caiaphas was the one who had told the other Jewish leaders, “It’s better that one man should die for the people.”
JHN.18.15	Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another of the disciples. That other disciple was acquainted with the high priest, so he was allowed to enter the high priest’s courtyard with Jesus. 
JHN.18.16	Peter had to stay outside the gate. Then the disciple who knew the high priest spoke to the woman watching at the gate, and she let Peter in. 
JHN.18.17	The woman asked Peter, “You’re not one of that man’s disciples, are you?”
JHN.18.17	“No,” he said, “I am not.”
JHN.18.18	Because it was cold, the household servants and the guards had made a charcoal fire. They stood around it, warming themselves, and Peter stood with them, warming himself.
JHN.18.19	Inside, the high priest began asking Jesus about his followers and what he had been teaching them. 
JHN.18.20	Jesus replied, 
JHN.18.22	Then one of the Temple guards standing nearby slapped Jesus across the face. “Is that the way to answer the high priest?” he demanded.
JHN.18.23	Jesus replied, 
JHN.18.24	Then Annas bound Jesus and sent him to Caiaphas, the high priest.
JHN.18.25	Meanwhile, as Simon Peter was standing by the fire warming himself, they asked him again, “You’re not one of his disciples, are you?”
JHN.18.25	He denied it, saying, “No, I am not.”
JHN.18.26	But one of the household slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Didn’t I see you out there in the olive grove with Jesus?” 
JHN.18.27	Again Peter denied it. And immediately a rooster crowed.
JHN.18.28	Jesus’ trial before Caiaphas ended in the early hours of the morning. Then he was taken to the headquarters of the Roman governor.
JHN.18.29	So Pilate, the governor, went out to them and asked, “What is your charge against this man?”
JHN.18.30	“We wouldn’t have handed him over to you if he weren’t a criminal!” they retorted.
JHN.18.31	“Then take him away and judge him by your own law,” Pilate told them.
JHN.18.31	“Only the Romans are permitted to execute someone,” the Jewish leaders replied. 
JHN.18.32	(This fulfilled Jesus’ prediction about the way he would die.
JHN.18.33	Then Pilate went back into his headquarters and called for Jesus to be brought to him. “Are you the king of the Jews?” he asked him.
JHN.18.34	Jesus replied, 
JHN.18.35	“Am I a Jew?” Pilate retorted. “Your own people and their leading priests brought you to me for trial. Why? What have you done?”
JHN.18.36	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.37	Pilate said, “So you are a king?”
JHN.18.37	Jesus responded, 
JHN.18.38	“What is truth?” Pilate asked. Then he went out again to the people and told them, “He is not guilty of any crime. 
JHN.18.39	But you have a custom of asking me to release one prisoner each year at Passover. Would you like me to release this ‘King of the Jews’?”
JHN.18.40	But they shouted back, “No! Not this man. We want Barabbas!” (Barabbas was a revolutionary.)
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate had Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip. 
JHN.19.2	The soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him. 
JHN.19.3	“Hail! King of the Jews!” they mocked, as they slapped him across the face.
JHN.19.4	Pilate went outside again and said to the people, “I am going to bring him out to you now, but understand clearly that I find him not guilty.” 
JHN.19.5	Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said, “Look, here is the man!”
JHN.19.6	When they saw him, the leading priests and Temple guards began shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
JHN.19.6	“Take him yourselves and crucify him,” Pilate said. “I find him not guilty.”
JHN.19.7	The Jewish leaders replied, “By our law he ought to die because he called himself the Son of God.”
JHN.19.8	When Pilate heard this, he was more frightened than ever. 
JHN.19.9	He took Jesus back into the headquarters
JHN.19.10	“Why don’t you talk to me?” Pilate demanded. “Don’t you realize that I have the power to release you or crucify you?”
JHN.19.11	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.19.12	Then Pilate tried to release him, but the Jewish leaders shouted, “If you release this man, you are no ‘friend of Caesar.’
JHN.19.13	When they said this, Pilate brought Jesus out to them again. Then Pilate sat down on the judgment seat on the platform that is called the Stone Pavement (in Hebrew, 
JHN.19.14	It was now about noon on the day of preparation for the Passover. And Pilate said to the people,
JHN.19.15	“Away with him,” they yelled. “Away with him! Crucify him!”
JHN.19.15	“What? Crucify your king?” Pilate asked.
JHN.19.15	“We have no king but Caesar,” the leading priests shouted back.
JHN.19.16	Then Pilate turned Jesus over to them to be crucified.
JHN.19.16	So they took Jesus away. 
JHN.19.17	Carrying the cross by himself, he went to the place called Place of the Skull (in Hebrew, 
JHN.19.18	There they nailed him to the cross. Two others were crucified with him, one on either side, with Jesus between them. 
JHN.19.19	And Pilate posted a sign on the cross that read, “Jesus of Nazareth,
JHN.19.20	The place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, so that many people could read it.
JHN.19.21	Then the leading priests objected and said to Pilate, “Change it from ‘The King of the Jews’ to ‘He said, I am King of the Jews.’”
JHN.19.22	Pilate replied, “No, what I have written, I have written.”
JHN.19.23	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes among the four of them. They also took his robe, but it was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. 
JHN.19.24	So they said, “Rather than tearing it apart, let’s throw dice
JHN.19.25	Standing near the cross were Jesus’ mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary (the wife of Clopas), and Mary Magdalene. 
JHN.19.26	When Jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved, he said to her, 
JHN.19.27	And he said to this disciple, 
JHN.19.28	Jesus knew that his mission was now finished, and to fulfill Scripture he said, 
JHN.19.29	A jar of sour wine was sitting there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put it on a hyssop branch, and held it up to his lips. 
JHN.19.30	When Jesus had tasted it, he said, 
JHN.19.31	It was the day of preparation, and the Jewish leaders didn’t want the bodies hanging there the next day, which was the Sabbath (and a very special Sabbath, because it was Passover week). So they asked Pilate to hasten their deaths by ordering that their legs be broken. Then their bodies could be taken down. 
JHN.19.32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men crucified with Jesus. 
JHN.19.33	But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, so they didn’t break his legs. 
JHN.19.34	One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out. 
JHN.19.35	(This report is from an eyewitness giving an accurate account. He speaks the truth so that you also may continue to believe.
JHN.19.36	These things happened in fulfillment of the Scriptures that say, “Not one of his bones will be broken,”
JHN.19.37	and “They will look on the one they pierced.”
JHN.19.38	Afterward Joseph of Arimathea, who had been a secret disciple of Jesus (because he feared the Jewish leaders), asked Pilate for permission to take down Jesus’ body. When Pilate gave permission, Joseph came and took the body away. 
JHN.19.39	With him came Nicodemus, the man who had come to Jesus at night. He brought about seventy-five pounds
JHN.19.40	Following Jewish burial custom, they wrapped Jesus’ body with the spices in long sheets of linen cloth. 
JHN.19.41	The place of crucifixion was near a garden, where there was a new tomb, never used before. 
JHN.19.42	And so, because it was the day of preparation for the Jewish Passover
JHN.20.1	Early on Sunday morning,
JHN.20.2	She ran and found Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. She said, “They have taken the Lord’s body out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him!”
JHN.20.3	Peter and the other disciple started out for the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	They were both running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 
JHN.20.5	He stooped and looked in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he didn’t go in. 
JHN.20.6	Then Simon Peter arrived and went inside. He also noticed the linen wrappings lying there, 
JHN.20.7	while the cloth that had covered Jesus’ head was folded up and lying apart from the other wrappings. 
JHN.20.8	Then the disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed—
JHN.20.9	for until then they still hadn’t understood the Scriptures that said Jesus must rise from the dead. 
JHN.20.10	Then they went home.
JHN.20.11	Mary was standing outside the tomb crying, and as she wept, she stooped and looked in. 
JHN.20.12	She saw two white-robed angels, one sitting at the head and the other at the foot of the place where the body of Jesus had been lying. 
JHN.20.13	“Dear woman, why are you crying?” the angels asked her.
JHN.20.13	“Because they have taken away my Lord,” she replied, “and I don’t know where they have put him.”
JHN.20.14	She turned to leave and saw someone standing there. It was Jesus, but she didn’t recognize him. 
JHN.20.15	 Jesus asked her. 
JHN.20.15	She thought he was the gardener. “Sir,” she said, “if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and get him.”
JHN.20.16	 Jesus said.
JHN.20.16	She turned to him and cried out, “Rabboni!” (which is Hebrew for “Teacher”).
JHN.20.17	 Jesus said, 
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene found the disciples and told them, “I have seen the Lord!” Then she gave them his message.
JHN.20.19	That Sunday evening
JHN.20.20	As he spoke, he showed them the wounds in his hands and his side. They were filled with joy when they saw the Lord! 
JHN.20.21	Again he said, 
JHN.20.22	Then he breathed on them and said, 
JHN.20.24	One of the twelve disciples, Thomas (nicknamed the Twin),
JHN.20.25	They told him, “We have seen the Lord!”
JHN.20.25	But he replied, “I won’t believe it unless I see the nail wounds in his hands, put my fingers into them, and place my hand into the wound in his side.”
JHN.20.26	Eight days later the disciples were together again, and this time Thomas was with them. The doors were locked; but suddenly, as before, Jesus was standing among them. 
JHN.20.27	Then he said to Thomas, 
JHN.20.28	“My Lord and my God!” Thomas exclaimed.
JHN.20.29	Then Jesus told him, 
JHN.20.30	The disciples saw Jesus do many other miraculous signs in addition to the ones recorded in this book. 
JHN.20.31	But these are written so that you may continue to believe
JHN.21.1	Later, Jesus appeared again to the disciples beside the Sea of Galilee.
JHN.21.2	Several of the disciples were there—Simon Peter, Thomas (nicknamed the Twin),
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter said, “I’m going fishing.”
JHN.21.3	“We’ll come, too,” they all said. So they went out in the boat, but they caught nothing all night.
JHN.21.4	At dawn Jesus was standing on the beach, but the disciples couldn’t see who he was. 
JHN.21.5	He called out, 
JHN.21.5	“No,” they replied.
JHN.21.6	Then he said, 
JHN.21.7	Then the disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his tunic (for he had stripped for work), jumped into the water, and headed to shore. 
JHN.21.8	The others stayed with the boat and pulled the loaded net to the shore, for they were only about a hundred yards
JHN.21.9	When they got there, they found breakfast waiting for them—fish cooking over a charcoal fire, and some bread.
JHN.21.10	 Jesus said. 
JHN.21.11	So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net to the shore. There were 153 large fish, and yet the net hadn’t torn.
JHN.21.12	 Jesus said. None of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord. 
JHN.21.13	Then Jesus served them the bread and the fish. 
JHN.21.14	This was the third time Jesus had appeared to his disciples since he had been raised from the dead.
JHN.21.15	After breakfast Jesus asked Simon Peter, 
JHN.21.15	“Yes, Lord,” Peter replied, “you know I love you.”
JHN.21.15	 Jesus told him.
JHN.21.16	Jesus repeated the question: 
JHN.21.16	“Yes, Lord,” Peter said, “you know I love you.”
JHN.21.16	 Jesus said.
JHN.21.17	A third time he asked him, 
JHN.21.17	Peter was hurt that Jesus asked the question a third time. He said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you.”
JHN.21.17	Jesus said, 
JHN.21.19	Jesus said this to let him know by what kind of death he would glorify God. Then Jesus told him, 
JHN.21.20	Peter turned around and saw behind them the disciple Jesus loved—the one who had leaned over to Jesus during supper and asked, “Lord, who will betray you?” 
JHN.21.21	Peter asked Jesus, “What about him, Lord?”
JHN.21.22	Jesus replied, 
JHN.21.23	So the rumor spread among the community of believers
JHN.21.24	This disciple is the one who testifies to these events and has recorded them here. And we know that his account of these things is accurate.
JHN.21.25	Jesus also did many other things. If they were all written down, I suppose the whole world could not contain the books that would be written.
ACT.1.1	In my first book
ACT.1.2	until the day he was taken up to heaven after giving his chosen apostles further instructions through the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.1.3	During the forty days after he suffered and died, he appeared to the apostles from time to time, and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive. And he talked to them about the Kingdom of God.
ACT.1.4	Once when he was eating with them, he commanded them, 
ACT.1.6	So when the apostles were with Jesus, they kept asking him, “Lord, has the time come for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom?”
ACT.1.7	He replied, 
ACT.1.9	After saying this, he was taken up into a cloud while they were watching, and they could no longer see him. 
ACT.1.10	As they strained to see him rising into heaven, two white-robed men suddenly stood among them. 
ACT.1.11	“Men of Galilee,” they said, “why are you standing here staring into heaven? Jesus has been taken from you into heaven, but someday he will return from heaven in the same way you saw him go!”
ACT.1.12	Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, a distance of half a mile.
ACT.1.13	When they arrived, they went to the upstairs room of the house where they were staying.
ACT.1.13	Here are the names of those who were present: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon (the zealot), and Judas (son of James). 
ACT.1.14	They all met together and were constantly united in prayer, along with Mary the mother of Jesus, several other women, and the brothers of Jesus.
ACT.1.15	During this time, when about 120 believers
ACT.1.16	“Brothers,” he said, “the Scriptures had to be fulfilled concerning Judas, who guided those who arrested Jesus. This was predicted long ago by the Holy Spirit, speaking through King David. 
ACT.1.17	Judas was one of us and shared in the ministry with us.”
ACT.1.18	(Judas had bought a field with the money he received for his treachery. Falling headfirst there, his body split open, spilling out all his intestines. 
ACT.1.19	The news of his death spread to all the people of Jerusalem, and they gave the place the Aramaic name 
ACT.1.20	Peter continued, “This was written in the book of Psalms, where it says, ‘Let his home become desolate, with no one living in it.’ It also says, ‘Let someone else take his position.’
ACT.1.21	“So now we must choose a replacement for Judas from among the men who were with us the entire time we were traveling with the Lord Jesus—
ACT.1.22	from the time he was baptized by John until the day he was taken from us. Whoever is chosen will join us as a witness of Jesus’ resurrection.”
ACT.1.23	So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. 
ACT.1.24	Then they all prayed, “O Lord, you know every heart. Show us which of these men you have chosen 
ACT.1.25	as an apostle to replace Judas in this ministry, for he has deserted us and gone where he belongs.” 
ACT.1.26	Then they cast lots, and Matthias was selected to become an apostle with the other eleven.
ACT.2.1	On the day of Pentecost
ACT.2.2	Suddenly, there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm, and it filled the house where they were sitting. 
ACT.2.3	Then, what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them. 
ACT.2.4	And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other languages,
ACT.2.5	At that time there were devout Jews from every nation living in Jerusalem. 
ACT.2.6	When they heard the loud noise, everyone came running, and they were bewildered to hear their own languages being spoken by the believers.
ACT.2.7	They were completely amazed. “How can this be?” they exclaimed. “These people are all from Galilee, 
ACT.2.8	and yet we hear them speaking in our own native languages! 
ACT.2.9	Here we are—Parthians, Medes, Elamites, people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, the province of Asia, 
ACT.2.10	Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the areas of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome 
ACT.2.11	(both Jews and converts to Judaism), Cretans, and Arabs. And we all hear these people speaking in our own languages about the wonderful things God has done!” 
ACT.2.12	They stood there amazed and perplexed. “What can this mean?” they asked each other.
ACT.2.13	But others in the crowd ridiculed them, saying, “They’re just drunk, that’s all!”
ACT.2.14	Then Peter stepped forward with the eleven other apostles and shouted to the crowd, “Listen carefully, all of you, fellow Jews and residents of Jerusalem! Make no mistake about this. 
ACT.2.15	These people are not drunk, as some of you are assuming. Nine o’clock in the morning is much too early for that. 
ACT.2.16	No, what you see was predicted long ago by the prophet Joel:
ACT.2.17	‘In the last days,’ God says,
ACT.2.17	‘I will pour out my Spirit upon all people.
ACT.2.17	Your sons and daughters will prophesy.
ACT.2.17	Your young men will see visions,
ACT.2.17	and your old men will dream dreams.
ACT.2.18	In those days I will pour out my Spirit
ACT.2.18	even on my servants—men and women alike—
ACT.2.18	and they will prophesy.
ACT.2.19	And I will cause wonders in the heavens above
ACT.2.19	and signs on the earth below—
ACT.2.19	blood and fire and clouds of smoke.
ACT.2.20	The sun will become dark,
ACT.2.20	and the moon will turn blood red
ACT.2.20	before that great and glorious day of the 
ACT.2.21	But everyone who calls on the name of the 
ACT.2.21	will be saved.’
ACT.2.22	“People of Israel, listen! God publicly endorsed Jesus the Nazarene
ACT.2.23	But God knew what would happen, and his prearranged plan was carried out when Jesus was betrayed. With the help of lawless Gentiles, you nailed him to a cross and killed him. 
ACT.2.24	But God released him from the horrors of death and raised him back to life, for death could not keep him in its grip. 
ACT.2.25	King David said this about him:
ACT.2.25	‘I see that the 
ACT.2.25	I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me.
ACT.2.26	No wonder my heart is glad,
ACT.2.26	and my tongue shouts his praises!
ACT.2.26	My body rests in hope.
ACT.2.27	For you will not leave my soul among the dead
ACT.2.27	or allow your Holy One to rot in the grave.
ACT.2.28	You have shown me the way of life,
ACT.2.28	and you will fill me with the joy of your presence.’
ACT.2.29	“Dear brothers, think about this! You can be sure that the patriarch David wasn’t referring to himself, for he died and was buried, and his tomb is still here among us. 
ACT.2.30	But he was a prophet, and he knew God had promised with an oath that one of David’s own descendants would sit on his throne. 
ACT.2.31	David was looking into the future and speaking of the Messiah’s resurrection. He was saying that God would not leave him among the dead or allow his body to rot in the grave.
ACT.2.32	“God raised Jesus from the dead, and we are all witnesses of this. 
ACT.2.33	Now he is exalted to the place of highest honor in heaven, at God’s right hand. And the Father, as he had promised, gave him the Holy Spirit to pour out upon us, just as you see and hear today. 
ACT.2.34	For David himself never ascended into heaven, yet he said,
ACT.2.34	‘The 
ACT.2.34	“Sit in the place of honor at my right hand
ACT.2.35	until I humble your enemies,
ACT.2.35	making them a footstool under your feet.”’
ACT.2.36	“So let everyone in Israel know for certain that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, to be both Lord and Messiah!”
ACT.2.37	Peter’s words pierced their hearts, and they said to him and to the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”
ACT.2.38	Peter replied, “Each of you must repent of your sins and turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.2.39	This promise is to you, to your children, and to those far away
ACT.2.40	Then Peter continued preaching for a long time, strongly urging all his listeners, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation!”
ACT.2.41	Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church that day—about 3,000 in all.
ACT.2.42	All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, and to fellowship, and to sharing in meals (including the Lord’s Supper
ACT.2.43	A deep sense of awe came over them all, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders. 
ACT.2.44	And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had. 
ACT.2.45	They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need. 
ACT.2.46	They worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the Lord’s Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity
ACT.2.47	all the while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved.
ACT.3.1	Peter and John went to the Temple one afternoon to take part in the three o’clock prayer service. 
ACT.3.2	As they approached the Temple, a man lame from birth was being carried in. Each day he was put beside the Temple gate, the one called the Beautiful Gate, so he could beg from the people going into the Temple. 
ACT.3.3	When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for some money.
ACT.3.4	Peter and John looked at him intently, and Peter said, “Look at us!” 
ACT.3.5	The lame man looked at them eagerly, expecting some money. 
ACT.3.6	But Peter said, “I don’t have any silver or gold for you. But I’ll give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene,
ACT.3.7	Then Peter took the lame man by the right hand and helped him up. And as he did, the man’s feet and ankles were instantly healed and strengthened. 
ACT.3.8	He jumped up, stood on his feet, and began to walk! Then, walking, leaping, and praising God, he went into the Temple with them.
ACT.3.9	All the people saw him walking and heard him praising God. 
ACT.3.10	When they realized he was the lame beggar they had seen so often at the Beautiful Gate, they were absolutely astounded! 
ACT.3.11	They all rushed out in amazement to Solomon’s Colonnade, where the man was holding tightly to Peter and John.
ACT.3.12	Peter saw his opportunity and addressed the crowd. “People of Israel,” he said, “what is so surprising about this? And why stare at us as though we had made this man walk by our own power or godliness? 
ACT.3.13	For it is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the God of all our ancestors—who has brought glory to his servant Jesus by doing this. This is the same Jesus whom you handed over and rejected before Pilate, despite Pilate’s decision to release him. 
ACT.3.14	You rejected this holy, righteous one and instead demanded the release of a murderer. 
ACT.3.15	You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. And we are witnesses of this fact!
ACT.3.16	“Through faith in the name of Jesus, this man was healed—and you know how crippled he was before. Faith in Jesus’ name has healed him before your very eyes.
ACT.3.17	“Friends,
ACT.3.18	But God was fulfilling what all the prophets had foretold about the Messiah—that he must suffer these things. 
ACT.3.19	Now repent of your sins and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped away. 
ACT.3.20	Then times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord, and he will again send you Jesus, your appointed Messiah. 
ACT.3.21	For he must remain in heaven until the time for the final restoration of all things, as God promised long ago through his holy prophets. 
ACT.3.22	Moses said, ‘The 
ACT.3.23	Then Moses said, ‘Anyone who will not listen to that Prophet will be completely cut off from God’s people.’
ACT.3.24	“Starting with Samuel, every prophet spoke about what is happening today. 
ACT.3.25	You are the children of those prophets, and you are included in the covenant God promised to your ancestors. For God said to Abraham, ‘Through your descendants
ACT.3.26	When God raised up his servant, Jesus, he sent him first to you people of Israel, to bless you by turning each of you back from your sinful ways.”
ACT.4.1	While Peter and John were speaking to the people, they were confronted by the priests, the captain of the Temple guard, and some of the Sadducees. 
ACT.4.2	These leaders were very disturbed that Peter and John were teaching the people that through Jesus there is a resurrection of the dead. 
ACT.4.3	They arrested them and, since it was already evening, put them in jail until morning. 
ACT.4.4	But many of the people who heard their message believed it, so the number of men who believed now totaled about 5,000.
ACT.4.5	The next day the council of all the rulers and elders and teachers of religious law met in Jerusalem. 
ACT.4.6	Annas the high priest was there, along with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and other relatives of the high priest. 
ACT.4.7	They brought in the two disciples and demanded, “By what power, or in whose name, have you done this?”
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers and elders of our people, 
ACT.4.9	are we being questioned today because we’ve done a good deed for a crippled man? Do you want to know how he was healed? 
ACT.4.10	Let me clearly state to all of you and to all the people of Israel that he was healed by the powerful name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene,
ACT.4.11	For Jesus is the one referred to in the Scriptures, where it says,
ACT.4.11	‘The stone that you builders rejected
ACT.4.11	has now become the cornerstone.’
ACT.4.12	There is salvation in no one else! God has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved.”
ACT.4.13	The members of the council were amazed when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, for they could see that they were ordinary men with no special training in the Scriptures. They also recognized them as men who had been with Jesus. 
ACT.4.14	But since they could see the man who had been healed standing right there among them, there was nothing the council could say. 
ACT.4.15	So they ordered Peter and John out of the council chamber
ACT.4.16	“What should we do with these men?” they asked each other. “We can’t deny that they have performed a miraculous sign, and everybody in Jerusalem knows about it. 
ACT.4.17	But to keep them from spreading their propaganda any further, we must warn them not to speak to anyone in Jesus’ name again.” 
ACT.4.18	So they called the apostles back in and commanded them never again to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John replied, “Do you think God wants us to obey you rather than him? 
ACT.4.20	We cannot stop telling about everything we have seen and heard.”
ACT.4.21	The council then threatened them further, but they finally let them go because they didn’t know how to punish them without starting a riot. For everyone was praising God 
ACT.4.22	for this miraculous sign—the healing of a man who had been lame for more than forty years.
ACT.4.23	As soon as they were freed, Peter and John returned to the other believers and told them what the leading priests and elders had said. 
ACT.4.24	When they heard the report, all the believers lifted their voices together in prayer to God: “O Sovereign Lord, Creator of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them—
ACT.4.25	you spoke long ago by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant, saying,
ACT.4.25	‘Why were the nations so angry?
ACT.4.25	Why did they waste their time with futile plans?
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth prepared for battle;
ACT.4.26	the rulers gathered together
ACT.4.26	against the 
ACT.4.26	and against his Messiah.’
ACT.4.27	“In fact, this has happened here in this very city! For Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate the governor, the Gentiles, and the people of Israel were all united against Jesus, your holy servant, whom you anointed. 
ACT.4.28	But everything they did was determined beforehand according to your will. 
ACT.4.29	And now, O Lord, hear their threats, and give us, your servants, great boldness in preaching your word. 
ACT.4.30	Stretch out your hand with healing power; may miraculous signs and wonders be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
ACT.4.31	After this prayer, the meeting place shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. Then they preached the word of God with boldness.
ACT.4.32	All the believers were united in heart and mind. And they felt that what they owned was not their own, so they shared everything they had. 
ACT.4.33	The apostles testified powerfully to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God’s great blessing was upon them all. 
ACT.4.34	There were no needy people among them, because those who owned land or houses would sell them 
ACT.4.35	and bring the money to the apostles to give to those in need.
ACT.4.36	For instance, there was Joseph, the one the apostles nicknamed Barnabas (which means “Son of Encouragement”). He was from the tribe of Levi and came from the island of Cyprus. 
ACT.4.37	He sold a field he owned and brought the money to the apostles.
ACT.5.1	But there was a certain man named Ananias who, with his wife, Sapphira, sold some property. 
ACT.5.2	He brought part of the money to the apostles, claiming it was the full amount. With his wife’s consent, he kept the rest.
ACT.5.3	Then Peter said, “Ananias, why have you let Satan fill your heart? You lied to the Holy Spirit, and you kept some of the money for yourself. 
ACT.5.4	The property was yours to sell or not sell, as you wished. And after selling it, the money was also yours to give away. How could you do a thing like this? You weren’t lying to us but to God!”
ACT.5.5	As soon as Ananias heard these words, he fell to the floor and died. Everyone who heard about it was terrified. 
ACT.5.6	Then some young men got up, wrapped him in a sheet, and took him out and buried him.
ACT.5.7	About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	Peter asked her, “Was this the price you and your husband received for your land?”
ACT.5.8	“Yes,” she replied, “that was the price.”
ACT.5.9	And Peter said, “How could the two of you even think of conspiring to test the Spirit of the Lord like this? The young men who buried your husband are just outside the door, and they will carry you out, too.”
ACT.5.10	Instantly, she fell to the floor and died. When the young men came in and saw that she was dead, they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
ACT.5.11	Great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what had happened.
ACT.5.12	The apostles were performing many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers were meeting regularly at the Temple in the area known as Solomon’s Colonnade. 
ACT.5.13	But no one else dared to join them, even though all the people had high regard for them. 
ACT.5.14	Yet more and more people believed and were brought to the Lord—crowds of both men and women. 
ACT.5.15	As a result of the apostles’ work, sick people were brought out into the streets on beds and mats so that Peter’s shadow might fall across some of them as he went by. 
ACT.5.16	Crowds came from the villages around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those possessed by evil
ACT.5.17	The high priest and his officials, who were Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. 
ACT.5.18	They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. 
ACT.5.19	But an angel of the Lord came at night, opened the gates of the jail, and brought them out. Then he told them, 
ACT.5.20	“Go to the Temple and give the people this message of life!”
ACT.5.21	So at daybreak the apostles entered the Temple, as they were told, and immediately began teaching.
ACT.5.21	When the high priest and his officials arrived, they convened the high council
ACT.5.22	But when the Temple guards went to the jail, the men were gone. So they returned to the council and reported, 
ACT.5.23	“The jail was securely locked, with the guards standing outside, but when we opened the gates, no one was there!”
ACT.5.24	When the captain of the Temple guard and the leading priests heard this, they were perplexed, wondering where it would all end. 
ACT.5.25	Then someone arrived with startling news: “The men you put in jail are standing in the Temple, teaching the people!”
ACT.5.26	The captain went with his Temple guards and arrested the apostles, but without violence, for they were afraid the people would stone them. 
ACT.5.27	Then they brought the apostles before the high council, where the high priest confronted them. 
ACT.5.28	“We gave you strict orders never again to teach in this man’s name!” he said. “Instead, you have filled all Jerusalem with your teaching about him, and you want to make us responsible for his death!”
ACT.5.29	But Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than any human authority. 
ACT.5.30	The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead after you killed him by hanging him on a cross.
ACT.5.31	Then God put him in the place of honor at his right hand as Prince and Savior. He did this so the people of Israel would repent of their sins and be forgiven. 
ACT.5.32	We are witnesses of these things and so is the Holy Spirit, who is given by God to those who obey him.”
ACT.5.33	When they heard this, the high council was furious and decided to kill them. 
ACT.5.34	But one member, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, who was an expert in religious law and respected by all the people, stood up and ordered that the men be sent outside the council chamber for a while. 
ACT.5.35	Then he said to his colleagues, “Men of Israel, take care what you are planning to do to these men! 
ACT.5.36	Some time ago there was that fellow Theudas, who pretended to be someone great. About 400 others joined him, but he was killed, and all his followers went their various ways. The whole movement came to nothing. 
ACT.5.37	After him, at the time of the census, there was Judas of Galilee. He got people to follow him, but he was killed, too, and all his followers were scattered.
ACT.5.38	“So my advice is, leave these men alone. Let them go. If they are planning and doing these things merely on their own, it will soon be overthrown. 
ACT.5.39	But if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You may even find yourselves fighting against God!”
ACT.5.40	The others accepted his advice. They called in the apostles and had them flogged. Then they ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus, and they let them go.
ACT.5.41	The apostles left the high council rejoicing that God had counted them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus.
ACT.5.42	And every day, in the Temple and from house to house, they continued to teach and preach this message: “Jesus is the Messiah.”
ACT.6.1	But as the believers
ACT.6.2	So the Twelve called a meeting of all the believers. They said, “We apostles should spend our time teaching the word of God, not running a food program. 
ACT.6.3	And so, brothers, select seven men who are well respected and are full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will give them this responsibility. 
ACT.6.4	Then we apostles can spend our time in prayer and teaching the word.”
ACT.6.5	Everyone liked this idea, and they chose the following: Stephen (a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas of Antioch (an earlier convert to the Jewish faith). 
ACT.6.6	These seven were presented to the apostles, who prayed for them as they laid their hands on them.
ACT.6.7	So God’s message continued to spread. The number of believers greatly increased in Jerusalem, and many of the Jewish priests were converted, too.
ACT.6.8	Stephen, a man full of God’s grace and power, performed amazing miracles and signs among the people. 
ACT.6.9	But one day some men from the Synagogue of Freed Slaves, as it was called, started to debate with him. They were Jews from Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia, and the province of Asia. 
ACT.6.10	None of them could stand against the wisdom and the Spirit with which Stephen spoke.
ACT.6.11	So they persuaded some men to lie about Stephen, saying, “We heard him blaspheme Moses, and even God.” 
ACT.6.12	This roused the people, the elders, and the teachers of religious law. So they arrested Stephen and brought him before the high council.
ACT.6.13	The lying witnesses said, “This man is always speaking against the holy Temple and against the law of Moses. 
ACT.6.14	We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth
ACT.6.15	At this point everyone in the high council stared at Stephen, because his face became as bright as an angel’s.
ACT.7.1	Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are these accusations true?”
ACT.7.2	This was Stephen’s reply: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me. Our glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham in Mesopotamia before he settled in Haran.
ACT.7.3	God told him, ‘Leave your native land and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’
ACT.7.4	So Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran until his father died. Then God brought him here to the land where you now live.
ACT.7.5	“But God gave him no inheritance here, not even one square foot of land. God did promise, however, that eventually the whole land would belong to Abraham and his descendants—even though he had no children yet. 
ACT.7.6	God also told him that his descendants would live in a foreign land, where they would be oppressed as slaves for 400 years. 
ACT.7.7	‘But I will punish the nation that enslaves them,’ God said, ‘and in the end they will come out and worship me here in this place.’
ACT.7.8	“God also gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision at that time. So when Abraham became the father of Isaac, he circumcised him on the eighth day. And the practice was continued when Isaac became the father of Jacob, and when Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs of the Israelite nation.
ACT.7.9	“These patriarchs were jealous of their brother Joseph, and they sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God was with him 
ACT.7.10	and rescued him from all his troubles. And God gave him favor before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. God also gave Joseph unusual wisdom, so that Pharaoh appointed him governor over all of Egypt and put him in charge of the palace.
ACT.7.11	“But a famine came upon Egypt and Canaan. There was great misery, and our ancestors ran out of food. 
ACT.7.12	Jacob heard that there was still grain in Egypt, so he sent his sons—our ancestors—to buy some. 
ACT.7.13	The second time they went, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers,
ACT.7.14	Then Joseph sent for his father, Jacob, and all his relatives to come to Egypt, seventy-five persons in all. 
ACT.7.15	So Jacob went to Egypt. He died there, as did our ancestors. 
ACT.7.16	Their bodies were taken to Shechem and buried in the tomb Abraham had bought for a certain price from Hamor’s sons in Shechem.
ACT.7.17	“As the time drew near when God would fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt greatly increased. 
ACT.7.18	But then a new king came to the throne of Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph. 
ACT.7.19	This king exploited our people and oppressed them, forcing parents to abandon their newborn babies so they would die.
ACT.7.20	“At that time Moses was born—a beautiful child in God’s eyes. His parents cared for him at home for three months. 
ACT.7.21	When they had to abandon him, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and raised him as her own son. 
ACT.7.22	Moses was taught all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in both speech and action.
ACT.7.23	“One day when Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his relatives, the people of Israel. 
ACT.7.24	He saw an Egyptian mistreating an Israelite. So Moses came to the man’s defense and avenged him, killing the Egyptian. 
ACT.7.25	Moses assumed his fellow Israelites would realize that God had sent him to rescue them, but they didn’t.
ACT.7.26	“The next day he visited them again and saw two men of Israel fighting. He tried to be a peacemaker. ‘Men,’ he said, ‘you are brothers. Why are you fighting each other?’
ACT.7.27	“But the man in the wrong pushed Moses aside. ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?’ he asked. 
ACT.7.28	‘Are you going to kill me as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?’ 
ACT.7.29	When Moses heard that, he fled the country and lived as a foreigner in the land of Midian. There his two sons were born.
ACT.7.30	“Forty years later, in the desert near Mount Sinai, an angel appeared to Moses in the flame of a burning bush. 
ACT.7.31	When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight. As he went to take a closer look, the voice of the 
ACT.7.32	‘I am the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses shook with terror and did not dare to look.
ACT.7.33	“Then the 
ACT.7.34	I have certainly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groans and have come down to rescue them. Now go, for I am sending you back to Egypt.’
ACT.7.35	“So God sent back the same man his people had previously rejected when they demanded, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?’ Through the angel who appeared to him in the burning bush, God sent Moses to be their ruler and savior. 
ACT.7.36	And by means of many wonders and miraculous signs, he led them out of Egypt, through the Red Sea, and through the wilderness for forty years.
ACT.7.37	“Moses himself told the people of Israel, ‘God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among your own people.’
ACT.7.38	Moses was with our ancestors, the assembly of God’s people in the wilderness, when the angel spoke to him at Mount Sinai. And there Moses received life-giving words to pass on to us.
ACT.7.39	“But our ancestors refused to listen to Moses. They rejected him and wanted to return to Egypt. 
ACT.7.40	They told Aaron, ‘Make us some gods who can lead us, for we don’t know what has become of this Moses, who brought us out of Egypt.’ 
ACT.7.41	So they made an idol shaped like a calf, and they sacrificed to it and celebrated over this thing they had made. 
ACT.7.42	Then God turned away from them and abandoned them to serve the stars of heaven as their gods! In the book of the prophets it is written,
ACT.7.42	‘Was it to me you were bringing sacrifices and offerings
ACT.7.42	during those forty years in the wilderness, Israel?
ACT.7.43	No, you carried your pagan gods—
ACT.7.43	the shrine of Molech,
ACT.7.43	the star of your god Rephan,
ACT.7.43	and the images you made to worship them.
ACT.7.43	So I will send you into exile
ACT.7.43	as far away as Babylon.’
ACT.7.44	“Our ancestors carried the Tabernacle
ACT.7.45	Years later, when Joshua led our ancestors in battle against the nations that God drove out of this land, the Tabernacle was taken with them into their new territory. And it stayed there until the time of King David.
ACT.7.46	“David found favor with God and asked for the privilege of building a permanent Temple for the God of Jacob.
ACT.7.47	But it was Solomon who actually built it. 
ACT.7.48	However, the Most High doesn’t live in temples made by human hands. As the prophet says,
ACT.7.49	‘Heaven is my throne,
ACT.7.49	and the earth is my footstool.
ACT.7.49	Could you build me a temple as good as that?’
ACT.7.49	asks the 
ACT.7.49	‘Could you build me such a resting place?
ACT.7.50	Didn’t my hands make both heaven and earth?’
ACT.7.51	“You stubborn people! You are heathen
ACT.7.52	Name one prophet your ancestors didn’t persecute! They even killed the ones who predicted the coming of the Righteous One—the Messiah whom you betrayed and murdered. 
ACT.7.53	You deliberately disobeyed God’s law, even though you received it from the hands of angels.”
ACT.7.54	The Jewish leaders were infuriated by Stephen’s accusation, and they shook their fists at him in rage.
ACT.7.55	But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed steadily into heaven and saw the glory of God, and he saw Jesus standing in the place of honor at God’s right hand. 
ACT.7.56	And he told them, “Look, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing in the place of honor at God’s right hand!”
ACT.7.57	Then they put their hands over their ears and began shouting. They rushed at him 
ACT.7.58	and dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. His accusers took off their coats and laid them at the feet of a young man named Saul.
ACT.7.59	As they stoned him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” 
ACT.7.60	He fell to his knees, shouting, “Lord, don’t charge them with this sin!” And with that, he died.
ACT.8.1	Saul was one of the witnesses, and he agreed completely with the killing of Stephen.
ACT.8.1	A great wave of persecution began that day, sweeping over the church in Jerusalem; and all the believers except the apostles were scattered through the regions of Judea and Samaria. 
ACT.8.2	(Some devout men came and buried Stephen with great mourning.) 
ACT.8.3	But Saul was going everywhere to destroy the church. He went from house to house, dragging out both men and women to throw them into prison.
ACT.8.4	But the believers who were scattered preached the Good News about Jesus wherever they went. 
ACT.8.5	Philip, for example, went to the city of Samaria and told the people there about the Messiah. 
ACT.8.6	Crowds listened intently to Philip because they were eager to hear his message and see the miraculous signs he did. 
ACT.8.7	Many evil
ACT.8.8	So there was great joy in that city.
ACT.8.9	A man named Simon had been a sorcerer there for many years, amazing the people of Samaria and claiming to be someone great. 
ACT.8.10	Everyone, from the least to the greatest, often spoke of him as “the Great One—the Power of God.” 
ACT.8.11	They listened closely to him because for a long time he had astounded them with his magic.
ACT.8.12	But now the people believed Philip’s message of Good News concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ. As a result, many men and women were baptized. 
ACT.8.13	Then Simon himself believed and was baptized. He began following Philip wherever he went, and he was amazed by the signs and great miracles Philip performed.
ACT.8.14	When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had accepted God’s message, they sent Peter and John there. 
ACT.8.15	As soon as they arrived, they prayed for these new believers to receive the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.8.16	The Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them, for they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.8.17	Then Peter and John laid their hands upon these believers, and they received the Holy Spirit.
ACT.8.18	When Simon saw that the Spirit was given when the apostles laid their hands on people, he offered them money to buy this power. 
ACT.8.19	“Let me have this power, too,” he exclaimed, “so that when I lay my hands on people, they will receive the Holy Spirit!”
ACT.8.20	But Peter replied, “May your money be destroyed with you for thinking God’s gift can be bought! 
ACT.8.21	You can have no part in this, for your heart is not right with God. 
ACT.8.22	Repent of your wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive your evil thoughts, 
ACT.8.23	for I can see that you are full of bitter jealousy and are held captive by sin.”
ACT.8.24	“Pray to the Lord for me,” Simon exclaimed, “that these terrible things you’ve said won’t happen to me!”
ACT.8.25	After testifying and preaching the word of the Lord in Samaria, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem. And they stopped in many Samaritan villages along the way to preach the Good News.
ACT.8.26	As for Philip, an angel of the Lord said to him, “Go south
ACT.8.27	So he started out, and he met the treasurer of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under the Kandake, the queen of Ethiopia. The eunuch had gone to Jerusalem to worship, 
ACT.8.28	and he was now returning. Seated in his carriage, he was reading aloud from the book of the prophet Isaiah.
ACT.8.29	The Holy Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and walk along beside the carriage.”
ACT.8.30	Philip ran over and heard the man reading from the prophet Isaiah. Philip asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”
ACT.8.31	The man replied, “How can I, unless someone instructs me?” And he urged Philip to come up into the carriage and sit with him.
ACT.8.32	The passage of Scripture he had been reading was this:
ACT.8.32	“He was led like a sheep to the slaughter.
ACT.8.32	And as a lamb is silent before the shearers,
ACT.8.32	he did not open his mouth.
ACT.8.33	He was humiliated and received no justice.
ACT.8.33	Who can speak of his descendants?
ACT.8.33	For his life was taken from the earth.”
ACT.8.34	The eunuch asked Philip, “Tell me, was the prophet talking about himself or someone else?” 
ACT.8.35	So beginning with this same Scripture, Philip told him the Good News about Jesus.
ACT.8.36	As they rode along, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “Look! There’s some water! Why can’t I be baptized?”
ACT.8.38	He ordered the carriage to stop, and they went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.
ACT.8.39	When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch never saw him again but went on his way rejoicing. 
ACT.8.40	Meanwhile, Philip found himself farther north at the town of Azotus. He preached the Good News there and in every town along the way until he came to Caesarea.
ACT.9.1	Meanwhile, Saul was uttering threats with every breath and was eager to kill the Lord’s followers.
ACT.9.2	He requested letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus, asking for their cooperation in the arrest of any followers of the Way he found there. He wanted to bring them—both men and women—back to Jerusalem in chains.
ACT.9.3	As he was approaching Damascus on this mission, a light from heaven suddenly shone down around him. 
ACT.9.4	He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, 
ACT.9.5	“Who are you, lord?” Saul asked.
ACT.9.5	And the voice replied, 
ACT.9.7	The men with Saul stood speechless, for they heard the sound of someone’s voice but saw no one! 
ACT.9.8	Saul picked himself up off the ground, but when he opened his eyes he was blind. So his companions led him by the hand to Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	He remained there blind for three days and did not eat or drink.
ACT.9.10	Now there was a believer
ACT.9.10	“Yes, Lord!” he replied.
ACT.9.11	The Lord said, 
ACT.9.13	“But Lord,” exclaimed Ananias, “I’ve heard many people talk about the terrible things this man has done to the believers
ACT.9.14	And he is authorized by the leading priests to arrest everyone who calls upon your name.”
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said, 
ACT.9.17	So Ananias went and found Saul. He laid his hands on him and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road, has sent me so that you might regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” 
ACT.9.18	Instantly something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he got up and was baptized. 
ACT.9.19	Afterward he ate some food and regained his strength.
ACT.9.19	Saul stayed with the believers
ACT.9.20	And immediately he began preaching about Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “He is indeed the Son of God!”
ACT.9.21	All who heard him were amazed. “Isn’t this the same man who caused such devastation among Jesus’ followers in Jerusalem?” they asked. “And didn’t he come here to arrest them and take them in chains to the leading priests?”
ACT.9.22	Saul’s preaching became more and more powerful, and the Jews in Damascus couldn’t refute his proofs that Jesus was indeed the Messiah. 
ACT.9.23	After a while some of the Jews plotted together to kill him. 
ACT.9.24	They were watching for him day and night at the city gate so they could murder him, but Saul was told about their plot. 
ACT.9.25	So during the night, some of the other believers
ACT.9.26	When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to meet with the believers, but they were all afraid of him. They did not believe he had truly become a believer! 
ACT.9.27	Then Barnabas brought him to the apostles and told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the way to Damascus and how the Lord had spoken to Saul. He also told them that Saul had preached boldly in the name of Jesus in Damascus.
ACT.9.28	So Saul stayed with the apostles and went all around Jerusalem with them, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. 
ACT.9.29	He debated with some Greek-speaking Jews, but they tried to murder him. 
ACT.9.30	When the believers
ACT.9.31	The church then had peace throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, and it became stronger as the believers lived in the fear of the Lord. And with the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it also grew in numbers.
ACT.9.32	Meanwhile, Peter traveled from place to place, and he came down to visit the believers in the town of Lydda. 
ACT.9.33	There he met a man named Aeneas, who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years. 
ACT.9.34	Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you! Get up, and roll up your sleeping mat!” And he was healed instantly. 
ACT.9.35	Then the whole population of Lydda and Sharon saw Aeneas walking around, and they turned to the Lord.
ACT.9.36	There was a believer in Joppa named Tabitha (which in Greek is Dorcas
ACT.9.37	About this time she became ill and died. Her body was washed for burial and laid in an upstairs room. 
ACT.9.38	But the believers had heard that Peter was nearby at Lydda, so they sent two men to beg him, “Please come as soon as possible!”
ACT.9.39	So Peter returned with them; and as soon as he arrived, they took him to the upstairs room. The room was filled with widows who were weeping and showing him the coats and other clothes Dorcas had made for them. 
ACT.9.40	But Peter asked them all to leave the room; then he knelt and prayed. Turning to the body he said, “Get up, Tabitha.” And she opened her eyes! When she saw Peter, she sat up! 
ACT.9.41	He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then he called in the widows and all the believers, and he presented her to them alive.
ACT.9.42	The news spread through the whole town, and many believed in the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	And Peter stayed a long time in Joppa, living with Simon, a tanner of hides.
ACT.10.1	In Caesarea there lived a Roman army officer
ACT.10.2	He was a devout, God-fearing man, as was everyone in his household. He gave generously to the poor and prayed regularly to God. 
ACT.10.3	One afternoon about three o’clock, he had a vision in which he saw an angel of God coming toward him. “Cornelius!” the angel said.
ACT.10.4	Cornelius stared at him in terror. “What is it, sir?” he asked the angel.
ACT.10.4	And the angel replied, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have been received by God as an offering! 
ACT.10.5	Now send some men to Joppa, and summon a man named Simon Peter. 
ACT.10.6	He is staying with Simon, a tanner who lives near the seashore.”
ACT.10.7	As soon as the angel was gone, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier, one of his personal attendants. 
ACT.10.8	He told them what had happened and sent them off to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	The next day as Cornelius’s messengers were nearing the town, Peter went up on the flat roof to pray. It was about noon, 
ACT.10.10	and he was hungry. But while a meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. 
ACT.10.11	He saw the sky open, and something like a large sheet was let down by its four corners. 
ACT.10.12	In the sheet were all sorts of animals, reptiles, and birds. 
ACT.10.13	Then a voice said to him, “Get up, Peter; kill and eat them.”
ACT.10.14	“No, Lord,” Peter declared. “I have never eaten anything that our Jewish laws have declared impure and unclean.
ACT.10.15	But the voice spoke again: “Do not call something unclean if God has made it clean.” 
ACT.10.16	The same vision was repeated three times. Then the sheet was suddenly pulled up to heaven.
ACT.10.17	Peter was very perplexed. What could the vision mean? Just then the men sent by Cornelius found Simon’s house. Standing outside the gate, 
ACT.10.18	they asked if a man named Simon Peter was staying there.
ACT.10.19	Meanwhile, as Peter was puzzling over the vision, the Holy Spirit said to him, “Three men have come looking for you. 
ACT.10.20	Get up, go downstairs, and go with them without hesitation. Don’t worry, for I have sent them.”
ACT.10.21	So Peter went down and said, “I’m the man you are looking for. Why have you come?”
ACT.10.22	They said, “We were sent by Cornelius, a Roman officer. He is a devout and God-fearing man, well respected by all the Jews. A holy angel instructed him to summon you to his house so that he can hear your message.” 
ACT.10.23	So Peter invited the men to stay for the night. The next day he went with them, accompanied by some of the brothers from Joppa.
ACT.10.24	They arrived in Caesarea the following day. Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends. 
ACT.10.25	As Peter entered his home, Cornelius fell at his feet and worshiped him. 
ACT.10.26	But Peter pulled him up and said, “Stand up! I’m a human being just like you!” 
ACT.10.27	So they talked together and went inside, where many others were assembled.
ACT.10.28	Peter told them, “You know it is against our laws for a Jewish man to enter a Gentile home like this or to associate with you. But God has shown me that I should no longer think of anyone as impure or unclean. 
ACT.10.29	So I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. Now tell me why you sent for me.”
ACT.10.30	Cornelius replied, “Four days ago I was praying in my house about this same time, three o’clock in the afternoon. Suddenly, a man in dazzling clothes was standing in front of me. 
ACT.10.31	He told me, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your gifts to the poor have been noticed by God! 
ACT.10.32	Now send messengers to Joppa, and summon a man named Simon Peter. He is staying in the home of Simon, a tanner who lives near the seashore.’ 
ACT.10.33	So I sent for you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here, waiting before God to hear the message the Lord has given you.”
ACT.10.34	Then Peter replied, “I see very clearly that God shows no favoritism. 
ACT.10.35	In every nation he accepts those who fear him and do what is right. 
ACT.10.36	This is the message of Good News for the people of Israel—that there is peace with God through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. 
ACT.10.37	You know what happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee, after John began preaching his message of baptism. 
ACT.10.38	And you know that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. Then Jesus went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
ACT.10.39	“And we apostles are witnesses of all he did throughout Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a cross,
ACT.10.40	but God raised him to life on the third day. Then God allowed him to appear, 
ACT.10.41	not to the general public,
ACT.10.42	And he ordered us to preach everywhere and to testify that Jesus is the one appointed by God to be the judge of all—the living and the dead. 
ACT.10.43	He is the one all the prophets testified about, saying that everyone who believes in him will have their sins forgiven through his name.”
ACT.10.44	Even as Peter was saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the message. 
ACT.10.45	The Jewish believers
ACT.10.46	For they heard them speaking in other tongues
ACT.10.46	Then Peter asked, 
ACT.10.47	“Can anyone object to their being baptized, now that they have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?” 
ACT.10.48	So he gave orders for them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Afterward Cornelius asked him to stay with them for several days.
ACT.11.1	Soon the news reached the apostles and other believers
ACT.11.2	But when Peter arrived back in Jerusalem, the Jewish believers
ACT.11.3	“You entered the home of Gentiles
ACT.11.4	Then Peter told them exactly what had happened. 
ACT.11.5	“I was in the town of Joppa,” he said, “and while I was praying, I went into a trance and saw a vision. Something like a large sheet was let down by its four corners from the sky. And it came right down to me. 
ACT.11.6	When I looked inside the sheet, I saw all sorts of tame and wild animals, reptiles, and birds. 
ACT.11.7	And I heard a voice say, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat them.’
ACT.11.8	“‘No, Lord,’ I replied. ‘I have never eaten anything that our Jewish laws have declared impure or unclean.
ACT.11.9	“But the voice from heaven spoke again: ‘Do not call something unclean if God has made it clean.’ 
ACT.11.10	This happened three times before the sheet and all it contained was pulled back up to heaven.
ACT.11.11	“Just then three men who had been sent from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were staying. 
ACT.11.12	The Holy Spirit told me to go with them and not to worry that they were Gentiles. These six brothers here accompanied me, and we soon entered the home of the man who had sent for us. 
ACT.11.13	He told us how an angel had appeared to him in his home and had told him, ‘Send messengers to Joppa, and summon a man named Simon Peter. 
ACT.11.14	He will tell you how you and everyone in your household can be saved!’
ACT.11.15	“As I began to speak,” Peter continued, “the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as he fell on us at the beginning. 
ACT.11.16	Then I thought of the Lord’s words when he said, 
ACT.11.17	And since God gave these Gentiles the same gift he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to stand in God’s way?”
ACT.11.18	When the others heard this, they stopped objecting and began praising God. They said, “We can see that God has also given the Gentiles the privilege of repenting of their sins and receiving eternal life.”
ACT.11.19	Meanwhile, the believers who had been scattered during the persecution after Stephen’s death traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch of Syria. They preached the word of God, but only to Jews. 
ACT.11.20	However, some of the believers who went to Antioch from Cyprus and Cyrene began preaching to the Gentiles
ACT.11.21	The power of the Lord was with them, and a large number of these Gentiles believed and turned to the Lord.
ACT.11.22	When the church at Jerusalem heard what had happened, they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
ACT.11.23	When he arrived and saw this evidence of God’s blessing, he was filled with joy, and he encouraged the believers to stay true to the Lord. 
ACT.11.24	Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and strong in faith. And many people were brought to the Lord.
ACT.11.25	Then Barnabas went on to Tarsus to look for Saul. 
ACT.11.26	When he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. Both of them stayed there with the church for a full year, teaching large crowds of people. (It was at Antioch that the believers
ACT.11.27	During this time some prophets traveled from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	One of them named Agabus stood up in one of the meetings and predicted by the Spirit that a great famine was coming upon the entire Roman world. (This was fulfilled during the reign of Claudius.) 
ACT.11.29	So the believers in Antioch decided to send relief to the brothers and sisters
ACT.11.30	This they did, entrusting their gifts to Barnabas and Saul to take to the elders of the church in Jerusalem.
ACT.12.1	About that time King Herod Agrippa
ACT.12.2	He had the apostle James (John’s brother) killed with a sword. 
ACT.12.3	When Herod saw how much this pleased the Jewish people, he also arrested Peter. (This took place during the Passover celebration.
ACT.12.4	Then he imprisoned him, placing him under the guard of four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring Peter out for public trial after the Passover. 
ACT.12.5	But while Peter was in prison, the church prayed very earnestly for him.
ACT.12.6	The night before Peter was to be placed on trial, he was asleep, fastened with two chains between two soldiers. Others stood guard at the prison gate. 
ACT.12.7	Suddenly, there was a bright light in the cell, and an angel of the Lord stood before Peter. The angel struck him on the side to awaken him and said, “Quick! Get up!” And the chains fell off his wrists. 
ACT.12.8	Then the angel told him, “Get dressed and put on your sandals.” And he did. “Now put on your coat and follow me,” the angel ordered.
ACT.12.9	So Peter left the cell, following the angel. But all the time he thought it was a vision. He didn’t realize it was actually happening. 
ACT.12.10	They passed the first and second guard posts and came to the iron gate leading to the city, and this opened for them all by itself. So they passed through and started walking down the street, and then the angel suddenly left him.
ACT.12.11	Peter finally came to his senses. “It’s really true!” he said. “The Lord has sent his angel and saved me from Herod and from what the Jewish leaders
ACT.12.12	When he realized this, he went to the home of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where many were gathered for prayer. 
ACT.12.13	He knocked at the door in the gate, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to open it. 
ACT.12.14	When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed that, instead of opening the door, she ran back inside and told everyone, “Peter is standing at the door!”
ACT.12.15	“You’re out of your mind!” they said. When she insisted, they decided, “It must be his angel.”
ACT.12.16	Meanwhile, Peter continued knocking. When they finally opened the door and saw him, they were amazed. 
ACT.12.17	He motioned for them to quiet down and told them how the Lord had led him out of prison. “Tell James and the other brothers what happened,” he said. And then he went to another place.
ACT.12.18	At dawn there was a great commotion among the soldiers about what had happened to Peter. 
ACT.12.19	Herod Agrippa ordered a thorough search for him. When he couldn’t be found, Herod interrogated the guards and sentenced them to death. Afterward Herod left Judea to stay in Caesarea for a while.
ACT.12.20	Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they sent a delegation to make peace with him because their cities were dependent upon Herod’s country for food. The delegates won the support of Blastus, Herod’s personal assistant, 
ACT.12.21	and an appointment with Herod was granted. When the day arrived, Herod put on his royal robes, sat on his throne, and made a speech to them. 
ACT.12.22	The people gave him a great ovation, shouting, “It’s the voice of a god, not of a man!”
ACT.12.23	Instantly, an angel of the Lord struck Herod with a sickness, because he accepted the people’s worship instead of giving the glory to God. So he was consumed with worms and died.
ACT.12.24	Meanwhile, the word of God continued to spread, and there were many new believers.
ACT.12.25	When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission to Jerusalem, they returned,
ACT.13.1	Among the prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch of Syria were Barnabas, Simeon (called “the black man”
ACT.13.2	One day as these men were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Appoint Barnabas and Saul for the special work to which I have called them.” 
ACT.13.3	So after more fasting and prayer, the men laid their hands on them and sent them on their way.
ACT.13.4	So Barnabas and Saul were sent out by the Holy Spirit. They went down to the seaport of Seleucia and then sailed for the island of Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	There, in the town of Salamis, they went to the Jewish synagogues and preached the word of God. John Mark went with them as their assistant.
ACT.13.6	Afterward they traveled from town to town across the entire island until finally they reached Paphos, where they met a Jewish sorcerer, a false prophet named Bar-Jesus. 
ACT.13.7	He had attached himself to the governor, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. The governor invited Barnabas and Saul to visit him, for he wanted to hear the word of God. 
ACT.13.8	But Elymas, the sorcerer (as his name means in Greek), interfered and urged the governor to pay no attention to what Barnabas and Saul said. He was trying to keep the governor from believing.
ACT.13.9	Saul, also known as Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he looked the sorcerer in the eye. 
ACT.13.10	Then he said, “You son of the devil, full of every sort of deceit and fraud, and enemy of all that is good! Will you never stop perverting the true ways of the Lord? 
ACT.13.11	Watch now, for the Lord has laid his hand of punishment upon you, and you will be struck blind. You will not see the sunlight for some time.” Instantly mist and darkness came over the man’s eyes, and he began groping around begging for someone to take his hand and lead him.
ACT.13.12	When the governor saw what had happened, he became a believer, for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Paul and his companions then left Paphos by ship for Pamphylia, landing at the port town of Perga. There John Mark left them and returned to Jerusalem. 
ACT.13.14	But Paul and Barnabas traveled inland to Antioch of Pisidia.
ACT.13.14	On the Sabbath they went to the synagogue for the services. 
ACT.13.15	After the usual readings from the books of Moses
ACT.13.16	So Paul stood, lifted his hand to quiet them, and started speaking. “Men of Israel,” he said, “and you God-fearing Gentiles, listen to me.
ACT.13.17	“The God of this nation of Israel chose our ancestors and made them multiply and grow strong during their stay in Egypt. Then with a powerful arm he led them out of their slavery. 
ACT.13.18	He put up with them
ACT.13.19	Then he destroyed seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to Israel as an inheritance. 
ACT.13.20	All this took about 450 years.
ACT.13.20	“After that, God gave them judges to rule until the time of Samuel the prophet. 
ACT.13.21	Then the people begged for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years. 
ACT.13.22	But God removed Saul and replaced him with David, a man about whom God said, ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will do everything I want him to do.’
ACT.13.23	“And it is one of King David’s descendants, Jesus, who is God’s promised Savior of Israel! 
ACT.13.24	Before he came, John the Baptist preached that all the people of Israel needed to repent of their sins and turn to God and be baptized. 
ACT.13.25	As John was finishing his ministry he asked, ‘Do you think I am the Messiah? No, I am not! But he is coming soon—and I’m not even worthy to be his slave and untie the sandals on his feet.’
ACT.13.26	“Brothers—you sons of Abraham, and also you God-fearing Gentiles—this message of salvation has been sent to us! 
ACT.13.27	The people in Jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize Jesus as the one the prophets had spoken about. Instead, they condemned him, and in doing this they fulfilled the prophets’ words that are read every Sabbath. 
ACT.13.28	They found no legal reason to execute him, but they asked Pilate to have him killed anyway.
ACT.13.29	“When they had done all that the prophecies said about him, they took him down from the cross
ACT.13.30	But God raised him from the dead! 
ACT.13.31	And over a period of many days he appeared to those who had gone with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to the people of Israel.
ACT.13.32	“And now we are here to bring you this Good News. The promise was made to our ancestors, 
ACT.13.33	and God has now fulfilled it for us, their descendants, by raising Jesus. This is what the second psalm says about Jesus:
ACT.13.33	‘You are my Son.
ACT.13.33	Today I have become your Father.
ACT.13.34	For God had promised to raise him from the dead, not leaving him to rot in the grave. He said, ‘I will give you the sacred blessings I promised to David.’
ACT.13.35	Another psalm explains it more fully: ‘You will not allow your Holy One to rot in the grave.’
ACT.13.36	This is not a reference to David, for after David had done the will of God in his own generation, he died and was buried with his ancestors, and his body decayed. 
ACT.13.37	No, it was a reference to someone else—someone whom God raised and whose body did not decay.
ACT.13.38	“Brothers, listen! We are here to proclaim that through this man Jesus there is forgiveness for your sins. 
ACT.13.39	Everyone who believes in him is made right in God’s sight—something the law of Moses could never do. 
ACT.13.40	Be careful! Don’t let the prophets’ words apply to you. For they said,
ACT.13.41	‘Look, you mockers,
ACT.13.41	be amazed and die!
ACT.13.41	For I am doing something in your own day,
ACT.13.41	something you wouldn’t believe
ACT.13.41	even if someone told you about it.’
ACT.13.42	As Paul and Barnabas left the synagogue that day, the people begged them to speak about these things again the next week. 
ACT.13.43	Many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, and the two men urged them to continue to rely on the grace of God.
ACT.13.44	The following week almost the entire city turned out to hear them preach the word of the Lord. 
ACT.13.45	But when some of the Jews saw the crowds, they were jealous; so they slandered Paul and argued against whatever he said.
ACT.13.46	Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and declared, “It was necessary that we first preach the word of God to you Jews. But since you have rejected it and judged yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we will offer it to the Gentiles. 
ACT.13.47	For the Lord gave us this command when he said,
ACT.13.47	‘I have made you a light to the Gentiles,
ACT.13.47	to bring salvation to the farthest corners of the earth.’
ACT.13.48	When the Gentiles heard this, they were very glad and thanked the Lord for his message; and all who were chosen for eternal life became believers. 
ACT.13.49	So the Lord’s message spread throughout that region.
ACT.13.50	Then the Jews stirred up the influential religious women and the leaders of the city, and they incited a mob against Paul and Barnabas and ran them out of town. 
ACT.13.51	So they shook the dust from their feet as a sign of rejection and went to the town of Iconium. 
ACT.13.52	And the believers
ACT.14.1	The same thing happened in Iconium.
ACT.14.2	Some of the Jews, however, spurned God’s message and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against Paul and Barnabas. 
ACT.14.3	But the apostles stayed there a long time, preaching boldly about the grace of the Lord. And the Lord proved their message was true by giving them power to do miraculous signs and wonders. 
ACT.14.4	But the people of the town were divided in their opinion about them. Some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
ACT.14.5	Then a mob of Gentiles and Jews, along with their leaders, decided to attack and stone them. 
ACT.14.6	When the apostles learned of it, they fled to the region of Lycaonia—to the towns of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding area. 
ACT.14.7	And there they preached the Good News.
ACT.14.8	While they were at Lystra, Paul and Barnabas came upon a man with crippled feet. He had been that way from birth, so he had never walked. He was sitting 
ACT.14.9	and listening as Paul preached. Looking straight at him, Paul realized he had faith to be healed. 
ACT.14.10	So Paul called to him in a loud voice, “Stand up!” And the man jumped to his feet and started walking.
ACT.14.11	When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in their local dialect, “These men are gods in human form!” 
ACT.14.12	They decided that Barnabas was the Greek god Zeus and that Paul was Hermes, since he was the chief speaker. 
ACT.14.13	Now the temple of Zeus was located just outside the town. So the priest of the temple and the crowd brought bulls and wreaths of flowers to the town gates, and they prepared to offer sacrifices to the apostles.
ACT.14.14	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard what was happening, they tore their clothing in dismay and ran out among the people, shouting, 
ACT.14.15	“Friends,
ACT.14.16	In the past he permitted all the nations to go their own ways, 
ACT.14.17	but he never left them without evidence of himself and his goodness. For instance, he sends you rain and good crops and gives you food and joyful hearts.” 
ACT.14.18	But even with these words, Paul and Barnabas could scarcely restrain the people from sacrificing to them.
ACT.14.19	Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowds to their side. They stoned Paul and dragged him out of town, thinking he was dead. 
ACT.14.20	But as the believers
ACT.14.21	After preaching the Good News in Derbe and making many disciples, Paul and Barnabas returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch of Pisidia, 
ACT.14.22	where they strengthened the believers. They encouraged them to continue in the faith, reminding them that we must suffer many hardships to enter the Kingdom of God. 
ACT.14.23	Paul and Barnabas also appointed elders in every church. With prayer and fasting, they turned the elders over to the care of the Lord, in whom they had put their trust. 
ACT.14.24	Then they traveled back through Pisidia to Pamphylia. 
ACT.14.25	They preached the word in Perga, then went down to Attalia.
ACT.14.26	Finally, they returned by ship to Antioch of Syria, where their journey had begun. The believers there had entrusted them to the grace of God to do the work they had now completed. 
ACT.14.27	Upon arriving in Antioch, they called the church together and reported everything God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles, too. 
ACT.14.28	And they stayed there with the believers for a long time.
ACT.15.1	While Paul and Barnabas were at Antioch of Syria, some men from Judea arrived and began to teach the believers
ACT.15.2	Paul and Barnabas disagreed with them, arguing vehemently. Finally, the church decided to send Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem, accompanied by some local believers, to talk to the apostles and elders about this question. 
ACT.15.3	The church sent the delegates to Jerusalem, and they stopped along the way in Phoenicia and Samaria to visit the believers. They told them—much to everyone’s joy—that the Gentiles, too, were being converted.
ACT.15.4	When they arrived in Jerusalem, Barnabas and Paul were welcomed by the whole church, including the apostles and elders. They reported everything God had done through them. 
ACT.15.5	But then some of the believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees stood up and insisted, “The Gentile converts must be circumcised and required to follow the law of Moses.”
ACT.15.6	So the apostles and elders met together to resolve this issue. 
ACT.15.7	At the meeting, after a long discussion, Peter stood and addressed them as follows: “Brothers, you all know that God chose me from among you some time ago to preach to the Gentiles so that they could hear the Good News and believe. 
ACT.15.8	God knows people’s hearts, and he confirmed that he accepts Gentiles by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us. 
ACT.15.9	He made no distinction between us and them, for he cleansed their hearts through faith. 
ACT.15.10	So why are you now challenging God by burdening the Gentile believers
ACT.15.11	We believe that we are all saved the same way, by the undeserved grace of the Lord Jesus.”
ACT.15.12	Everyone listened quietly as Barnabas and Paul told about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
ACT.15.13	When they had finished, James stood and said, “Brothers, listen to me. 
ACT.15.14	Peter
ACT.15.15	And this conversion of Gentiles is exactly what the prophets predicted. As it is written:
ACT.15.16	‘Afterward I will return
ACT.15.16	and restore the fallen house
ACT.15.16	I will rebuild its ruins
ACT.15.16	and restore it,
ACT.15.17	so that the rest of humanity might seek the 
ACT.15.17	including the Gentiles—
ACT.15.17	all those I have called to be mine.
ACT.15.17	The 
ACT.15.18	he who made these things known so long ago.’
ACT.15.19	“And so my judgment is that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. 
ACT.15.20	Instead, we should write and tell them to abstain from eating food offered to idols, from sexual immorality, from eating the meat of strangled animals, and from consuming blood. 
ACT.15.21	For these laws of Moses have been preached in Jewish synagogues in every city on every Sabbath for many generations.”
ACT.15.22	Then the apostles and elders together with the whole church in Jerusalem chose delegates, and they sent them to Antioch of Syria with Paul and Barnabas to report on this decision. The men chosen were two of the church leaders
ACT.15.23	This is the letter they took with them:
ACT.15.23	“This letter is from the apostles and elders, your brothers in Jerusalem. It is written to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings!
ACT.15.24	“We understand that some men from here have troubled you and upset you with their teaching, but we did not send them! 
ACT.15.25	So we decided, having come to complete agreement, to send you official representatives, along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
ACT.15.26	who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.15.27	We are sending Judas and Silas to confirm what we have decided concerning your question.
ACT.15.28	“For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay no greater burden on you than these few requirements: 
ACT.15.29	You must abstain from eating food offered to idols, from consuming blood or the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. If you do this, you will do well. Farewell.”
ACT.15.30	The messengers went at once to Antioch, where they called a general meeting of the believers and delivered the letter. 
ACT.15.31	And there was great joy throughout the church that day as they read this encouraging message.
ACT.15.32	Then Judas and Silas, both being prophets, spoke at length to the believers, encouraging and strengthening their faith. 
ACT.15.33	They stayed for a while, and then the believers sent them back to the church in Jerusalem with a blessing of peace.
ACT.15.35	Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch. They and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord there.
ACT.15.36	After some time Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s go back and visit each city where we previously preached the word of the Lord, to see how the new believers are doing.” 
ACT.15.37	Barnabas agreed and wanted to take along John Mark. 
ACT.15.38	But Paul disagreed strongly, since John Mark had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in their work. 
ACT.15.39	Their disagreement was so sharp that they separated. Barnabas took John Mark with him and sailed for Cyprus. 
ACT.15.40	Paul chose Silas, and as he left, the believers entrusted him to the Lord’s gracious care. 
ACT.15.41	Then he traveled throughout Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches there.
ACT.16.1	Paul went first to Derbe and then to Lystra, where there was a young disciple named Timothy. His mother was a Jewish believer, but his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.2	Timothy was well thought of by the believers
ACT.16.3	so Paul wanted him to join them on their journey. In deference to the Jews of the area, he arranged for Timothy to be circumcised before they left, for everyone knew that his father was a Greek. 
ACT.16.4	Then they went from town to town, instructing the believers to follow the decisions made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem. 
ACT.16.5	So the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew larger every day.
ACT.16.6	Next Paul and Silas traveled through the area of Phrygia and Galatia, because the Holy Spirit had prevented them from preaching the word in the province of Asia at that time. 
ACT.16.7	Then coming to the borders of Mysia, they headed north for the province of Bithynia,
ACT.16.8	So instead, they went on through Mysia to the seaport of Troas.
ACT.16.9	That night Paul had a vision: A man from Macedonia in northern Greece was standing there, pleading with him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!” 
ACT.16.10	So we
ACT.16.11	We boarded a boat at Troas and sailed straight across to the island of Samothrace, and the next day we landed at Neapolis. 
ACT.16.12	From there we reached Philippi, a major city of that district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. And we stayed there several days.
ACT.16.13	On the Sabbath we went a little way outside the city to a riverbank, where we thought people would be meeting for prayer, and we sat down to speak with some women who had gathered there. 
ACT.16.14	One of them was Lydia from Thyatira, a merchant of expensive purple cloth, who worshiped God. As she listened to us, the Lord opened her heart, and she accepted what Paul was saying. 
ACT.16.15	She and her household were baptized, and she asked us to be her guests. “If you agree that I am a true believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and stay at my home.” And she urged us until we agreed.
ACT.16.16	One day as we were going down to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit that enabled her to tell the future. She earned a lot of money for her masters by telling fortunes. 
ACT.16.17	She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, and they have come to tell you how to be saved.”
ACT.16.18	This went on day after day until Paul got so exasperated that he turned and said to the demon within her, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And instantly it left her.
ACT.16.19	Her masters’ hopes of wealth were now shattered, so they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities at the marketplace. 
ACT.16.20	“The whole city is in an uproar because of these Jews!” they shouted to the city officials. 
ACT.16.21	“They are teaching customs that are illegal for us Romans to practice.”
ACT.16.22	A mob quickly formed against Paul and Silas, and the city officials ordered them stripped and beaten with wooden rods. 
ACT.16.23	They were severely beaten, and then they were thrown into prison. The jailer was ordered to make sure they didn’t escape. 
ACT.16.24	So the jailer put them into the inner dungeon and clamped their feet in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	Around midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening. 
ACT.16.26	Suddenly, there was a massive earthquake, and the prison was shaken to its foundations. All the doors immediately flew open, and the chains of every prisoner fell off! 
ACT.16.27	The jailer woke up to see the prison doors wide open. He assumed the prisoners had escaped, so he drew his sword to kill himself. 
ACT.16.28	But Paul shouted to him, “Stop! Don’t kill yourself! We are all here!”
ACT.16.29	The jailer called for lights and ran to the dungeon and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. 
ACT.16.30	Then he brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
ACT.16.31	They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, along with everyone in your household.” 
ACT.16.32	And they shared the word of the Lord with him and with all who lived in his household. 
ACT.16.33	Even at that hour of the night, the jailer cared for them and washed their wounds. Then he and everyone in his household were immediately baptized. 
ACT.16.34	He brought them into his house and set a meal before them, and he and his entire household rejoiced because they all believed in God.
ACT.16.35	The next morning the city officials sent the police to tell the jailer, “Let those men go!” 
ACT.16.36	So the jailer told Paul, “The city officials have said you and Silas are free to leave. Go in peace.”
ACT.16.37	But Paul replied, “They have publicly beaten us without a trial and put us in prison—and we are Roman citizens. So now they want us to leave secretly? Certainly not! Let them come themselves to release us!”
ACT.16.38	When the police reported this, the city officials were alarmed to learn that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens. 
ACT.16.39	So they came to the jail and apologized to them. Then they brought them out and begged them to leave the city. 
ACT.16.40	When Paul and Silas left the prison, they returned to the home of Lydia. There they met with the believers and encouraged them once more. Then they left town.
ACT.17.1	Paul and Silas then traveled through the towns of Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. 
ACT.17.2	As was Paul’s custom, he went to the synagogue service, and for three Sabbaths in a row he used the Scriptures to reason with the people. 
ACT.17.3	He explained the prophecies and proved that the Messiah must suffer and rise from the dead. He said, “This Jesus I’m telling you about is the Messiah.” 
ACT.17.4	Some of the Jews who listened were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with many God-fearing Greek men and quite a few prominent women.
ACT.17.5	But some of the Jews were jealous, so they gathered some troublemakers from the marketplace to form a mob and start a riot. They attacked the home of Jason, searching for Paul and Silas so they could drag them out to the crowd.
ACT.17.6	Not finding them there, they dragged out Jason and some of the other believers
ACT.17.7	And Jason has welcomed them into his home. They are all guilty of treason against Caesar, for they profess allegiance to another king, named Jesus.”
ACT.17.8	The people of the city, as well as the city council, were thrown into turmoil by these reports. 
ACT.17.9	So the officials forced Jason and the other believers to post bond, and then they released them.
ACT.17.10	That very night the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea. When they arrived there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. 
ACT.17.11	And the people of Berea were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, and they listened eagerly to Paul’s message. They searched the Scriptures day after day to see if Paul and Silas were teaching the truth. 
ACT.17.12	As a result, many Jews believed, as did many of the prominent Greek women and men.
ACT.17.13	But when some Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God in Berea, they went there and stirred up trouble. 
ACT.17.14	The believers acted at once, sending Paul on to the coast, while Silas and Timothy remained behind. 
ACT.17.15	Those escorting Paul went with him all the way to Athens; then they returned to Berea with instructions for Silas and Timothy to hurry and join him.
ACT.17.16	While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was deeply troubled by all the idols he saw everywhere in the city. 
ACT.17.17	He went to the synagogue to reason with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and he spoke daily in the public square to all who happened to be there.
ACT.17.18	He also had a debate with some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers. When he told them about Jesus and his resurrection, they said, “What’s this babbler trying to say with these strange ideas he’s picked up?” Others said, “He seems to be preaching about some foreign gods.”
ACT.17.19	Then they took him to the high council of the city.
ACT.17.20	“You are saying some rather strange things, and we want to know what it’s all about.” 
ACT.17.21	(It should be explained that all the Athenians as well as the foreigners in Athens seemed to spend all their time discussing the latest ideas.)
ACT.17.22	So Paul, standing before the council,
ACT.17.23	for as I was walking along I saw your many shrines. And one of your altars had this inscription on it: ‘To an Unknown God.’ This God, whom you worship without knowing, is the one I’m telling you about.
ACT.17.24	“He is the God who made the world and everything in it. Since he is Lord of heaven and earth, he doesn’t live in man-made temples, 
ACT.17.25	and human hands can’t serve his needs—for he has no needs. He himself gives life and breath to everything, and he satisfies every need. 
ACT.17.26	From one man
ACT.17.27	“His purpose was for the nations to seek after God and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him—though he is not far from any one of us. 
ACT.17.28	For in him we live and move and exist. As some of your
ACT.17.29	And since this is true, we shouldn’t think of God as an idol designed by craftsmen from gold or silver or stone.
ACT.17.30	“God overlooked people’s ignorance about these things in earlier times, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent of their sins and turn to him. 
ACT.17.31	For he has set a day for judging the world with justice by the man he has appointed, and he proved to everyone who this is by raising him from the dead.”
ACT.17.32	When they heard Paul speak about the resurrection of the dead, some laughed in contempt, but others said, “We want to hear more about this later.” 
ACT.17.33	That ended Paul’s discussion with them, 
ACT.17.34	but some joined him and became believers. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the council,
ACT.18.1	Then Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
ACT.18.2	There he became acquainted with a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife, Priscilla. They had left Italy when Claudius Caesar deported all Jews from Rome. 
ACT.18.3	Paul lived and worked with them, for they were tentmakers
ACT.18.4	Each Sabbath found Paul at the synagogue, trying to convince the Jews and Greeks alike. 
ACT.18.5	And after Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul spent all his time preaching the word. He testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. 
ACT.18.6	But when they opposed and insulted him, Paul shook the dust from his clothes and said, “Your blood is upon your own heads—I am innocent. From now on I will go preach to the Gentiles.”
ACT.18.7	Then he left and went to the home of Titius Justus, a Gentile who worshiped God and lived next door to the synagogue. 
ACT.18.8	Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, and everyone in his household believed in the Lord. Many others in Corinth also heard Paul, became believers, and were baptized.
ACT.18.9	One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision and told him, 
ACT.18.11	So Paul stayed there for the next year and a half, teaching the word of God.
ACT.18.12	But when Gallio became governor of Achaia, some Jews rose up together against Paul and brought him before the governor for judgment. 
ACT.18.13	They accused Paul of “persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to our law.”
ACT.18.14	But just as Paul started to make his defense, Gallio turned to Paul’s accusers and said, “Listen, you Jews, if this were a case involving some wrongdoing or a serious crime, I would have a reason to accept your case. 
ACT.18.15	But since it is merely a question of words and names and your Jewish law, take care of it yourselves. I refuse to judge such matters.” 
ACT.18.16	And he threw them out of the courtroom.
ACT.18.17	The crowd
ACT.18.18	Paul stayed in Corinth for some time after that, then said good-bye to the brothers and sisters
ACT.18.19	They stopped first at the port of Ephesus, where Paul left the others behind. While he was there, he went to the synagogue to reason with the Jews. 
ACT.18.20	They asked him to stay longer, but he declined. 
ACT.18.21	As he left, however, he said, “I will come back later,
ACT.18.22	The next stop was at the port of Caesarea. From there he went up and visited the church at Jerusalem
ACT.18.23	After spending some time in Antioch, Paul went back through Galatia and Phrygia, visiting and strengthening all the believers.
ACT.18.24	Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos, an eloquent speaker who knew the Scriptures well, had arrived in Ephesus from Alexandria in Egypt. 
ACT.18.25	He had been taught the way of the Lord, and he taught others about Jesus with an enthusiastic spirit
ACT.18.26	When Priscilla and Aquila heard him preaching boldly in the synagogue, they took him aside and explained the way of God even more accurately.
ACT.18.27	Apollos had been thinking about going to Achaia, and the brothers and sisters in Ephesus encouraged him to go. They wrote to the believers in Achaia, asking them to welcome him. When he arrived there, he proved to be of great benefit to those who, by God’s grace, had believed. 
ACT.18.28	He refuted the Jews with powerful arguments in public debate. Using the Scriptures, he explained to them that Jesus was the Messiah.
ACT.19.1	While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the interior regions until he reached Ephesus, on the coast, where he found several believers.
ACT.19.2	“Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” he asked them.
ACT.19.2	“No,” they replied, “we haven’t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
ACT.19.3	“Then what baptism did you experience?” he asked.
ACT.19.3	And they replied, “The baptism of John.”
ACT.19.4	Paul said, “John’s baptism called for repentance from sin. But John himself told the people to believe in the one who would come later, meaning Jesus.”
ACT.19.5	As soon as they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.19.6	Then when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in other tongues
ACT.19.7	There were about twelve men in all.
ACT.19.8	Then Paul went to the synagogue and preached boldly for the next three months, arguing persuasively about the Kingdom of God. 
ACT.19.9	But some became stubborn, rejecting his message and publicly speaking against the Way. So Paul left the synagogue and took the believers with him. Then he held daily discussions at the lecture hall of Tyrannus. 
ACT.19.10	This went on for the next two years, so that people throughout the province of Asia—both Jews and Greeks—heard the word of the Lord.
ACT.19.11	God gave Paul the power to perform unusual miracles. 
ACT.19.12	When handkerchiefs or aprons that had merely touched his skin were placed on sick people, they were healed of their diseases, and evil spirits were expelled.
ACT.19.13	A group of Jews was traveling from town to town casting out evil spirits. They tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus in their incantation, saying, “I command you in the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, to come out!” 
ACT.19.14	Seven sons of Sceva, a leading priest, were doing this. 
ACT.19.15	But one time when they tried it, the evil spirit replied, “I know Jesus, and I know Paul, but who are you?” 
ACT.19.16	Then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them, overpowered them, and attacked them with such violence that they fled from the house, naked and battered.
ACT.19.17	The story of what happened spread quickly all through Ephesus, to Jews and Greeks alike. A solemn fear descended on the city, and the name of the Lord Jesus was greatly honored. 
ACT.19.18	Many who became believers confessed their sinful practices. 
ACT.19.19	A number of them who had been practicing sorcery brought their incantation books and burned them at a public bonfire. The value of the books was several million dollars.
ACT.19.20	So the message about the Lord spread widely and had a powerful effect.
ACT.19.21	Afterward Paul felt compelled by the Spirit
ACT.19.22	He sent his two assistants, Timothy and Erastus, ahead to Macedonia while he stayed awhile longer in the province of Asia.
ACT.19.23	About that time, serious trouble developed in Ephesus concerning the Way. 
ACT.19.24	It began with Demetrius, a silversmith who had a large business manufacturing silver shrines of the Greek goddess Artemis.
ACT.19.25	He called them together, along with others employed in similar trades, and addressed them as follows:
ACT.19.25	“Gentlemen, you know that our wealth comes from this business. 
ACT.19.26	But as you have seen and heard, this man Paul has persuaded many people that handmade gods aren’t really gods at all. And he’s done this not only here in Ephesus but throughout the entire province! 
ACT.19.27	Of course, I’m not just talking about the loss of public respect for our business. I’m also concerned that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will lose its influence and that Artemis—this magnificent goddess worshiped throughout the province of Asia and all around the world—will be robbed of her great prestige!”
ACT.19.28	At this their anger boiled, and they began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
ACT.19.29	Soon the whole city was filled with confusion. Everyone rushed to the amphitheater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, who were Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia. 
ACT.19.30	Paul wanted to go in, too, but the believers wouldn’t let him. 
ACT.19.31	Some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, also sent a message to him, begging him not to risk his life by entering the amphitheater.
ACT.19.32	Inside, the people were all shouting, some one thing and some another. Everything was in confusion. In fact, most of them didn’t even know why they were there. 
ACT.19.33	The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander forward and told him to explain the situation. He motioned for silence and tried to speak. 
ACT.19.34	But when the crowd realized he was a Jew, they started shouting again and kept it up for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians! Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
ACT.19.35	At last the mayor was able to quiet them down enough to speak. “Citizens of Ephesus,” he said. “Everyone knows that Ephesus is the official guardian of the temple of the great Artemis, whose image fell down to us from heaven. 
ACT.19.36	Since this is an undeniable fact, you should stay calm and not do anything rash. 
ACT.19.37	You have brought these men here, but they have stolen nothing from the temple and have not spoken against our goddess.
ACT.19.38	“If Demetrius and the craftsmen have a case against them, the courts are in session and the officials can hear the case at once. Let them make formal charges. 
ACT.19.39	And if there are complaints about other matters, they can be settled in a legal assembly. 
ACT.19.40	I am afraid we are in danger of being charged with rioting by the Roman government, since there is no cause for all this commotion. And if Rome demands an explanation, we won’t know what to say.” 
ACT.19.41	Then he dismissed them, and they dispersed.
ACT.20.1	When the uproar was over, Paul sent for the believers
ACT.20.2	While there, he encouraged the believers in all the towns he passed through. Then he traveled down to Greece, 
ACT.20.3	where he stayed for three months. He was preparing to sail back to Syria when he discovered a plot by some Jews against his life, so he decided to return through Macedonia.
ACT.20.4	Several men were traveling with him. They were Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea; Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica; Gaius from Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. 
ACT.20.5	They went on ahead and waited for us at Troas. 
ACT.20.6	After the Passover
ACT.20.7	On the first day of the week, we gathered with the local believers to share in the Lord’s Supper.
ACT.20.8	The upstairs room where we met was lighted with many flickering lamps. 
ACT.20.9	As Paul spoke on and on, a young man named Eutychus, sitting on the windowsill, became very drowsy. Finally, he fell sound asleep and dropped three stories to his death below. 
ACT.20.10	Paul went down, bent over him, and took him into his arms. “Don’t worry,” he said, “he’s alive!” 
ACT.20.11	Then they all went back upstairs, shared in the Lord’s Supper,
ACT.20.12	Meanwhile, the young man was taken home alive and well, and everyone was greatly relieved.
ACT.20.13	Paul went by land to Assos, where he had arranged for us to join him, while we traveled by ship. 
ACT.20.14	He joined us there, and we sailed together to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	The next day we sailed past the island of Kios. The following day we crossed to the island of Samos, and
ACT.20.16	Paul had decided to sail on past Ephesus, for he didn’t want to spend any more time in the province of Asia. He was hurrying to get to Jerusalem, if possible, in time for the Festival of Pentecost. 
ACT.20.17	But when we landed at Miletus, he sent a message to the elders of the church at Ephesus, asking them to come and meet him.
ACT.20.18	When they arrived he declared, “You know that from the day I set foot in the province of Asia until now 
ACT.20.19	I have done the Lord’s work humbly and with many tears. I have endured the trials that came to me from the plots of the Jews. 
ACT.20.20	I never shrank back from telling you what you needed to hear, either publicly or in your homes. 
ACT.20.21	I have had one message for Jews and Greeks alike—the necessity of repenting from sin and turning to God, and of having faith in our Lord Jesus.
ACT.20.22	“And now I am bound by the Spirit
ACT.20.23	except that the Holy Spirit tells me in city after city that jail and suffering lie ahead. 
ACT.20.24	But my life is worth nothing to me unless I use it for finishing the work assigned me by the Lord Jesus—the work of telling others the Good News about the wonderful grace of God.
ACT.20.25	“And now I know that none of you to whom I have preached the Kingdom will ever see me again. 
ACT.20.26	I declare today that I have been faithful. If anyone suffers eternal death, it’s not my fault,
ACT.20.27	for I didn’t shrink from declaring all that God wants you to know.
ACT.20.28	“So guard yourselves and God’s people. Feed and shepherd God’s flock—his church, purchased with his own blood
ACT.20.29	I know that false teachers, like vicious wolves, will come in among you after I leave, not sparing the flock. 
ACT.20.30	Even some men from your own group will rise up and distort the truth in order to draw a following. 
ACT.20.31	Watch out! Remember the three years I was with you—my constant watch and care over you night and day, and my many tears for you.
ACT.20.32	“And now I entrust you to God and the message of his grace that is able to build you up and give you an inheritance with all those he has set apart for himself.
ACT.20.33	“I have never coveted anyone’s silver or gold or fine clothes. 
ACT.20.34	You know that these hands of mine have worked to supply my own needs and even the needs of those who were with me. 
ACT.20.35	And I have been a constant example of how you can help those in need by working hard. You should remember the words of the Lord Jesus: 
ACT.20.36	When he had finished speaking, he knelt and prayed with them. 
ACT.20.37	They all cried as they embraced and kissed him good-bye. 
ACT.20.38	They were sad most of all because he had said that they would never see him again. Then they escorted him down to the ship.
ACT.21.1	After saying farewell to the Ephesian elders, we sailed straight to the island of Cos. The next day we reached Rhodes and then went to Patara. 
ACT.21.2	There we boarded a ship sailing for Phoenicia. 
ACT.21.3	We sighted the island of Cyprus, passed it on our left, and landed at the harbor of Tyre, in Syria, where the ship was to unload its cargo.
ACT.21.4	We went ashore, found the local believers,
ACT.21.5	When we returned to the ship at the end of the week, the entire congregation, including women
ACT.21.6	and said our farewells. Then we went aboard, and they returned home.
ACT.21.7	The next stop after leaving Tyre was Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and sisters
ACT.21.8	The next day we went on to Caesarea and stayed at the home of Philip the Evangelist, one of the seven men who had been chosen to distribute food. 
ACT.21.9	He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.
ACT.21.10	Several days later a man named Agabus, who also had the gift of prophecy, arrived from Judea. 
ACT.21.11	He came over, took Paul’s belt, and bound his own feet and hands with it. Then he said, “The Holy Spirit declares, ‘So shall the owner of this belt be bound by the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem and turned over to the Gentiles.’” 
ACT.21.12	When we heard this, we and the local believers all begged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
ACT.21.13	But he said, “Why all this weeping? You are breaking my heart! I am ready not only to be jailed at Jerusalem but even to die for the sake of the Lord Jesus.” 
ACT.21.14	When it was clear that we couldn’t persuade him, we gave up and said, “The Lord’s will be done.”
ACT.21.15	After this we packed our things and left for Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	Some believers from Caesarea accompanied us, and they took us to the home of Mnason, a man originally from Cyprus and one of the early believers. 
ACT.21.17	When we arrived, the brothers and sisters in Jerusalem welcomed us warmly.
ACT.21.18	The next day Paul went with us to meet with James, and all the elders of the Jerusalem church were present. 
ACT.21.19	After greeting them, Paul gave a detailed account of the things God had accomplished among the Gentiles through his ministry.
ACT.21.20	After hearing this, they praised God. And then they said, “You know, dear brother, how many thousands of Jews have also believed, and they all follow the law of Moses very seriously. 
ACT.21.21	But the Jewish believers here in Jerusalem have been told that you are teaching all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn their backs on the laws of Moses. They’ve heard that you teach them not to circumcise their children or follow other Jewish customs. 
ACT.21.22	What should we do? They will certainly hear that you have come.
ACT.21.23	“Here’s what we want you to do. We have four men here who have completed their vow. 
ACT.21.24	Go with them to the Temple and join them in the purification ceremony, paying for them to have their heads ritually shaved. Then everyone will know that the rumors are all false and that you yourself observe the Jewish laws.
ACT.21.25	“As for the Gentile believers, they should do what we already told them in a letter: They should abstain from eating food offered to idols, from consuming blood or the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality.”
ACT.21.26	So Paul went to the Temple the next day with the other men. They had already started the purification ritual, so he publicly announced the date when their vows would end and sacrifices would be offered for each of them.
ACT.21.27	The seven days were almost ended when some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul in the Temple and roused a mob against him. They grabbed him, 
ACT.21.28	yelling, “Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who preaches against our people everywhere and tells everybody to disobey the Jewish laws. He speaks against the Temple—and even defiles this holy place by bringing in Gentiles.
ACT.21.29	(For earlier that day they had seen him in the city with Trophimus, a Gentile from Ephesus,
ACT.21.30	The whole city was rocked by these accusations, and a great riot followed. Paul was grabbed and dragged out of the Temple, and immediately the gates were closed behind him. 
ACT.21.31	As they were trying to kill him, word reached the commander of the Roman regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. 
ACT.21.32	He immediately called out his soldiers and officers
ACT.21.33	Then the commander arrested him and ordered him bound with two chains. He asked the crowd who he was and what he had done. 
ACT.21.34	Some shouted one thing and some another. Since he couldn’t find out the truth in all the uproar and confusion, he ordered that Paul be taken to the fortress. 
ACT.21.35	As Paul reached the stairs, the mob grew so violent the soldiers had to lift him to their shoulders to protect him. 
ACT.21.36	And the crowd followed behind, shouting, “Kill him, kill him!”
ACT.21.37	As Paul was about to be taken inside, he said to the commander, “May I have a word with you?”
ACT.21.37	“Do you know Greek?” the commander asked, surprised. 
ACT.21.38	“Aren’t you the Egyptian who led a rebellion some time ago and took 4,000 members of the Assassins out into the desert?”
ACT.21.39	“No,” Paul replied, “I am a Jew and a citizen of Tarsus in Cilicia, which is an important city. Please, let me talk to these people.” 
ACT.21.40	The commander agreed, so Paul stood on the stairs and motioned to the people to be quiet. Soon a deep silence enveloped the crowd, and he addressed them in their own language, Aramaic.
ACT.22.1	“Brothers and esteemed fathers,” Paul said, “listen to me as I offer my defense.” 
ACT.22.2	When they heard him speaking in their own language,
ACT.22.3	Then Paul said, “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, and I was brought up and educated here in Jerusalem under Gamaliel. As his student, I was carefully trained in our Jewish laws and customs. I became very zealous to honor God in everything I did, just like all of you today. 
ACT.22.4	And I persecuted the followers of the Way, hounding some to death, arresting both men and women and throwing them in prison. 
ACT.22.5	The high priest and the whole council of elders can testify that this is so. For I received letters from them to our Jewish brothers in Damascus, authorizing me to bring the followers of the Way from there to Jerusalem, in chains, to be punished.
ACT.22.6	“As I was on the road, approaching Damascus about noon, a very bright light from heaven suddenly shone down around me. 
ACT.22.7	I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 
ACT.22.8	“‘Who are you, lord?’ I asked.
ACT.22.8	“And the voice replied, 
ACT.22.9	The people with me saw the light but didn’t understand the voice speaking to me.
ACT.22.10	“I asked, ‘What should I do, Lord?’
ACT.22.10	“And the Lord told me, 
ACT.22.11	“I was blinded by the intense light and had to be led by the hand to Damascus by my companions. 
ACT.22.12	A man named Ananias lived there. He was a godly man, deeply devoted to the law, and well regarded by all the Jews of Damascus. 
ACT.22.13	He came and stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight.’ And that very moment I could see him!
ACT.22.14	“Then he told me, ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and hear him speak. 
ACT.22.15	For you are to be his witness, telling everyone what you have seen and heard. 
ACT.22.16	What are you waiting for? Get up and be baptized. Have your sins washed away by calling on the name of the Lord.’
ACT.22.17	“After I returned to Jerusalem, I was praying in the Temple and fell into a trance. 
ACT.22.18	I saw a vision of Jesus
ACT.22.19	“‘But Lord,’ I argued, ‘they certainly know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you. 
ACT.22.20	And I was in complete agreement when your witness Stephen was killed. I stood by and kept the coats they took off when they stoned him.’
ACT.22.21	“But the Lord said to me, 
ACT.22.22	The crowd listened until Paul said that word. Then they all began to shout, “Away with such a fellow! He isn’t fit to live!” 
ACT.22.23	They yelled, threw off their coats, and tossed handfuls of dust into the air.
ACT.22.24	The commander brought Paul inside and ordered him lashed with whips to make him confess his crime. He wanted to find out why the crowd had become so furious. 
ACT.22.25	When they tied Paul down to lash him, Paul said to the officer
ACT.22.26	When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and asked, “What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen!”
ACT.22.27	So the commander went over and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”
ACT.22.27	“Yes, I certainly am,” Paul replied.
ACT.22.28	“I am, too,” the commander muttered, “and it cost me plenty!”
ACT.22.28	Paul answered, “But I am a citizen by birth!”
ACT.22.29	The soldiers who were about to interrogate Paul quickly withdrew when they heard he was a Roman citizen, and the commander was frightened because he had ordered him bound and whipped.
ACT.22.30	The next day the commander ordered the leading priests into session with the Jewish high council.
ACT.23.1	Gazing intently at the high council,
ACT.23.2	Instantly Ananias the high priest commanded those close to Paul to slap him on the mouth. 
ACT.23.3	But Paul said to him, “God will slap you, you corrupt hypocrite!
ACT.23.4	Those standing near Paul said to him, “Do you dare to insult God’s high priest?”
ACT.23.5	“I’m sorry, brothers. I didn’t realize he was the high priest,” Paul replied, “for the Scriptures say, ‘You must not speak evil of any of your rulers.’
ACT.23.6	Paul realized that some members of the high council were Sadducees and some were Pharisees, so he shouted, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, as were my ancestors! And I am on trial because my hope is in the resurrection of the dead!”
ACT.23.7	This divided the council—the Pharisees against the Sadducees—
ACT.23.8	for the Sadducees say there is no resurrection or angels or spirits, but the Pharisees believe in all of these. 
ACT.23.9	So there was a great uproar. Some of the teachers of religious law who were Pharisees jumped up and began to argue forcefully. “We see nothing wrong with him,” they shouted. “Perhaps a spirit or an angel spoke to him.” 
ACT.23.10	As the conflict grew more violent, the commander was afraid they would tear Paul apart. So he ordered his soldiers to go and rescue him by force and take him back to the fortress.
ACT.23.11	That night the Lord appeared to Paul and said, 
ACT.23.12	The next morning a group of Jews
ACT.23.13	There were more than forty of them in the conspiracy. 
ACT.23.14	They went to the leading priests and elders and told them, “We have bound ourselves with an oath to eat nothing until we have killed Paul. 
ACT.23.15	So you and the high council should ask the commander to bring Paul back to the council again. Pretend you want to examine his case more fully. We will kill him on the way.”
ACT.23.16	But Paul’s nephew—his sister’s son—heard of their plan and went to the fortress and told Paul. 
ACT.23.17	Paul called for one of the Roman officers
ACT.23.18	So the officer did, explaining, “Paul, the prisoner, called me over and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”
ACT.23.19	The commander took his hand, led him aside, and asked, “What is it you want to tell me?”
ACT.23.20	Paul’s nephew told him, “Some Jews are going to ask you to bring Paul before the high council tomorrow, pretending they want to get some more information. 
ACT.23.21	But don’t do it! There are more than forty men hiding along the way ready to ambush him. They have vowed not to eat or drink anything until they have killed him. They are ready now, just waiting for your consent.”
ACT.23.22	“Don’t let anyone know you told me this,” the commander warned the young man.
ACT.23.23	Then the commander called two of his officers and ordered, “Get 200 soldiers ready to leave for Caesarea at nine o’clock tonight. Also take 200 spearmen and 70 mounted troops. 
ACT.23.24	Provide horses for Paul to ride, and get him safely to Governor Felix.” 
ACT.23.25	Then he wrote this letter to the governor:
ACT.23.26	“From Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings!
ACT.23.27	“This man was seized by some Jews, and they were about to kill him when I arrived with the troops. When I learned that he was a Roman citizen, I removed him to safety. 
ACT.23.28	Then I took him to their high council to try to learn the basis of the accusations against him. 
ACT.23.29	I soon discovered the charge was something regarding their religious law—certainly nothing worthy of imprisonment or death. 
ACT.23.30	But when I was informed of a plot to kill him, I immediately sent him on to you. I have told his accusers to bring their charges before you.”
ACT.23.31	So that night, as ordered, the soldiers took Paul as far as Antipatris. 
ACT.23.32	They returned to the fortress the next morning, while the mounted troops took him on to Caesarea. 
ACT.23.33	When they arrived in Caesarea, they presented Paul and the letter to Governor Felix. 
ACT.23.34	He read it and then asked Paul what province he was from. “Cilicia,” Paul answered.
ACT.23.35	“I will hear your case myself when your accusers arrive,” the governor told him. Then the governor ordered him kept in the prison at Herod’s headquarters.
ACT.24.1	Five days later Ananias, the high priest, arrived with some of the Jewish elders and the lawyer
ACT.24.2	When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented the charges against Paul in the following address to the governor:
ACT.24.2	“You have provided a long period of peace for us Jews and with foresight have enacted reforms for us. 
ACT.24.3	For all of this, Your Excellency, we are very grateful to you. 
ACT.24.4	But I don’t want to bore you, so please give me your attention for only a moment. 
ACT.24.5	We have found this man to be a troublemaker who is constantly stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the cult known as the Nazarenes. 
ACT.24.6	Furthermore, he was trying to desecrate the Temple when we arrested him.
ACT.24.8	You can find out the truth of our accusations by examining him yourself.” 
ACT.24.9	Then the other Jews chimed in, declaring that everything Tertullus said was true.
ACT.24.10	The governor then motioned for Paul to speak. Paul said, “I know, sir, that you have been a judge of Jewish affairs for many years, so I gladly present my defense before you. 
ACT.24.11	You can quickly discover that I arrived in Jerusalem no more than twelve days ago to worship at the Temple. 
ACT.24.12	My accusers never found me arguing with anyone in the Temple, nor stirring up a riot in any synagogue or on the streets of the city. 
ACT.24.13	These men cannot prove the things they accuse me of doing.
ACT.24.14	“But I admit that I follow the Way, which they call a cult. I worship the God of our ancestors, and I firmly believe the Jewish law and everything written in the prophets. 
ACT.24.15	I have the same hope in God that these men have, that he will raise both the righteous and the unrighteous. 
ACT.24.16	Because of this, I always try to maintain a clear conscience before God and all people.
ACT.24.17	“After several years away, I returned to Jerusalem with money to aid my people and to offer sacrifices to God. 
ACT.24.18	My accusers saw me in the Temple as I was completing a purification ceremony. There was no crowd around me and no rioting. 
ACT.24.19	But some Jews from the province of Asia were there—and they ought to be here to bring charges if they have anything against me! 
ACT.24.20	Ask these men here what crime the Jewish high council
ACT.24.21	except for the one time I shouted out, ‘I am on trial before you today because I believe in the resurrection of the dead!’”
ACT.24.22	At that point Felix, who was quite familiar with the Way, adjourned the hearing and said, “Wait until Lysias, the garrison commander, arrives. Then I will decide the case.” 
ACT.24.23	He ordered an officer
ACT.24.24	A few days later Felix came back with his wife, Drusilla, who was Jewish. Sending for Paul, they listened as he told them about faith in Christ Jesus. 
ACT.24.25	As he reasoned with them about righteousness and self-control and the coming day of judgment, Felix became frightened. “Go away for now,” he replied. “When it is more convenient, I’ll call for you again.” 
ACT.24.26	He also hoped that Paul would bribe him, so he sent for him quite often and talked with him.
ACT.24.27	After two years went by in this way, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And because Felix wanted to gain favor with the Jewish people, he left Paul in prison.
ACT.25.1	Three days after Festus arrived in Caesarea to take over his new responsibilities, he left for Jerusalem, 
ACT.25.2	where the leading priests and other Jewish leaders met with him and made their accusations against Paul. 
ACT.25.3	They asked Festus as a favor to transfer Paul to Jerusalem (planning to ambush and kill him on the way). 
ACT.25.4	But Festus replied that Paul was at Caesarea and he himself would be returning there soon. 
ACT.25.5	So he said, “Those of you in authority can return with me. If Paul has done anything wrong, you can make your accusations.”
ACT.25.6	About eight or ten days later Festus returned to Caesarea, and on the following day he took his seat in court and ordered that Paul be brought in. 
ACT.25.7	When Paul arrived, the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem gathered around and made many serious accusations they couldn’t prove.
ACT.25.8	Paul denied the charges. “I am not guilty of any crime against the Jewish laws or the Temple or the Roman government,” he said.
ACT.25.9	Then Festus, wanting to please the Jews, asked him, “Are you willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there?”
ACT.25.10	But Paul replied, “No! This is the official Roman court, so I ought to be tried right here. You know very well I am not guilty of harming the Jews. 
ACT.25.11	If I have done something worthy of death, I don’t refuse to die. But if I am innocent, no one has a right to turn me over to these men to kill me. I appeal to Caesar!”
ACT.25.12	Festus conferred with his advisers and then replied, “Very well! You have appealed to Caesar, and to Caesar you will go!”
ACT.25.13	A few days later King Agrippa arrived with his sister, Bernice,
ACT.25.14	During their stay of several days, Festus discussed Paul’s case with the king. “There is a prisoner here,” he told him, “whose case was left for me by Felix. 
ACT.25.15	When I was in Jerusalem, the leading priests and Jewish elders pressed charges against him and asked me to condemn him. 
ACT.25.16	I pointed out to them that Roman law does not convict people without a trial. They must be given an opportunity to confront their accusers and defend themselves.
ACT.25.17	“When his accusers came here for the trial, I didn’t delay. I called the case the very next day and ordered Paul brought in. 
ACT.25.18	But the accusations made against him weren’t any of the crimes I expected. 
ACT.25.19	Instead, it was something about their religion and a dead man named Jesus, who Paul insists is alive. 
ACT.25.20	I was at a loss to know how to investigate these things, so I asked him whether he would be willing to stand trial on these charges in Jerusalem. 
ACT.25.21	But Paul appealed to have his case decided by the emperor. So I ordered that he be held in custody until I could arrange to send him to Caesar.”
ACT.25.22	“I’d like to hear the man myself,” Agrippa said.
ACT.25.22	And Festus replied, “You will—tomorrow!”
ACT.25.23	So the next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived at the auditorium with great pomp, accompanied by military officers and prominent men of the city. Festus ordered that Paul be brought in. 
ACT.25.24	Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are here, this is the man whose death is demanded by all the Jews, both here and in Jerusalem. 
ACT.25.25	But in my opinion he has done nothing deserving death. However, since he appealed his case to the emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome.
ACT.25.26	“But what shall I write the emperor? For there is no clear charge against him. So I have brought him before all of you, and especially you, King Agrippa, so that after we examine him, I might have something to write. 
ACT.25.27	For it makes no sense to send a prisoner to the emperor without specifying the charges against him!”
ACT.26.1	Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You may speak in your defense.”
ACT.26.1	So Paul, gesturing with his hand, started his defense: 
ACT.26.2	“I am fortunate, King Agrippa, that you are the one hearing my defense today against all these accusations made by the Jewish leaders, 
ACT.26.3	for I know you are an expert on all Jewish customs and controversies. Now please listen to me patiently!
ACT.26.4	“As the Jewish leaders are well aware, I was given a thorough Jewish training from my earliest childhood among my own people and in Jerusalem. 
ACT.26.5	If they would admit it, they know that I have been a member of the Pharisees, the strictest sect of our religion. 
ACT.26.6	Now I am on trial because of my hope in the fulfillment of God’s promise made to our ancestors. 
ACT.26.7	In fact, that is why the twelve tribes of Israel zealously worship God night and day, and they share the same hope I have. Yet, Your Majesty, they accuse me for having this hope! 
ACT.26.8	Why does it seem incredible to any of you that God can raise the dead?
ACT.26.9	“I used to believe that I ought to do everything I could to oppose the very name of Jesus the Nazarene.
ACT.26.10	Indeed, I did just that in Jerusalem. Authorized by the leading priests, I caused many believers
ACT.26.11	Many times I had them punished in the synagogues to get them to curse Jesus.
ACT.26.12	“One day I was on such a mission to Damascus, armed with the authority and commission of the leading priests. 
ACT.26.13	About noon, Your Majesty, as I was on the road, a light from heaven brighter than the sun shone down on me and my companions. 
ACT.26.14	We all fell down, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic,
ACT.26.15	“‘Who are you, lord?’ I asked.
ACT.26.15	“And the Lord replied, 
ACT.26.19	“And so, King Agrippa, I obeyed that vision from heaven. 
ACT.26.20	I preached first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that all must repent of their sins and turn to God—and prove they have changed by the good things they do. 
ACT.26.21	Some Jews arrested me in the Temple for preaching this, and they tried to kill me. 
ACT.26.22	But God has protected me right up to this present time so I can testify to everyone, from the least to the greatest. I teach nothing except what the prophets and Moses said would happen—
ACT.26.23	that the Messiah would suffer and be the first to rise from the dead, and in this way announce God’s light to Jews and Gentiles alike.”
ACT.26.24	Suddenly, Festus shouted, “Paul, you are insane. Too much study has made you crazy!”
ACT.26.25	But Paul replied, “I am not insane, Most Excellent Festus. What I am saying is the sober truth. 
ACT.26.26	And King Agrippa knows about these things. I speak boldly, for I am sure these events are all familiar to him, for they were not done in a corner! 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do—”
ACT.26.28	Agrippa interrupted him. “Do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian so quickly?”
ACT.26.29	Paul replied, “Whether quickly or not, I pray to God that both you and everyone here in this audience might become the same as I am, except for these chains.”
ACT.26.30	Then the king, the governor, Bernice, and all the others stood and left. 
ACT.26.31	As they went out, they talked it over and agreed, “This man hasn’t done anything to deserve death or imprisonment.”
ACT.26.32	And Agrippa said to Festus, “He could have been set free if he hadn’t appealed to Caesar.”
ACT.27.1	When the time came, we set sail for Italy. Paul and several other prisoners were placed in the custody of a Roman officer
ACT.27.2	Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was also with us. We left on a ship whose home port was Adramyttium on the northwest coast of the province of Asia;
ACT.27.3	The next day when we docked at Sidon, Julius was very kind to Paul and let him go ashore to visit with friends so they could provide for his needs. 
ACT.27.4	Putting out to sea from there, we encountered strong headwinds that made it difficult to keep the ship on course, so we sailed north of Cyprus between the island and the mainland. 
ACT.27.5	Keeping to the open sea, we passed along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, landing at Myra, in the province of Lycia. 
ACT.27.6	There the commanding officer found an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that was bound for Italy, and he put us on board.
ACT.27.7	We had several days of slow sailing, and after great difficulty we finally neared Cnidus. But the wind was against us, so we sailed across to Crete and along the sheltered coast of the island, past the cape of Salmone. 
ACT.27.8	We struggled along the coast with great difficulty and finally arrived at Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea. 
ACT.27.9	We had lost a lot of time. The weather was becoming dangerous for sea travel because it was so late in the fall,
ACT.27.10	“Men,” he said, “I believe there is trouble ahead if we go on—shipwreck, loss of cargo, and danger to our lives as well.” 
ACT.27.11	But the officer in charge of the prisoners listened more to the ship’s captain and the owner than to Paul. 
ACT.27.12	And since Fair Havens was an exposed harbor—a poor place to spend the winter—most of the crew wanted to go on to Phoenix, farther up the coast of Crete, and spend the winter there. Phoenix was a good harbor with only a southwest and northwest exposure.
ACT.27.13	When a light wind began blowing from the south, the sailors thought they could make it. So they pulled up anchor and sailed close to the shore of Crete. 
ACT.27.14	But the weather changed abruptly, and a wind of typhoon strength (called a “northeaster”) burst across the island and blew us out to sea. 
ACT.27.15	The sailors couldn’t turn the ship into the wind, so they gave up and let it run before the gale.
ACT.27.16	We sailed along the sheltered side of a small island named Cauda,
ACT.27.17	Then the sailors bound ropes around the hull of the ship to strengthen it. They were afraid of being driven across to the sandbars of Syrtis off the African coast, so they lowered the sea anchor to slow the ship and were driven before the wind.
ACT.27.18	The next day, as gale-force winds continued to batter the ship, the crew began throwing the cargo overboard. 
ACT.27.19	The following day they even took some of the ship’s gear and threw it overboard. 
ACT.27.20	The terrible storm raged for many days, blotting out the sun and the stars, until at last all hope was gone.
ACT.27.21	No one had eaten for a long time. Finally, Paul called the crew together and said, “Men, you should have listened to me in the first place and not left Crete. You would have avoided all this damage and loss. 
ACT.27.22	But take courage! None of you will lose your lives, even though the ship will go down. 
ACT.27.23	For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me, 
ACT.27.24	and he said, ‘Don’t be afraid, Paul, for you will surely stand trial before Caesar! What’s more, God in his goodness has granted safety to everyone sailing with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	So take courage! For I believe God. It will be just as he said. 
ACT.27.26	But we will be shipwrecked on an island.”
ACT.27.27	About midnight on the fourteenth night of the storm, as we were being driven across the Sea of Adria,
ACT.27.28	They dropped a weighted line and found that the water was 120 feet deep. But a little later they measured again and found it was only 90 feet deep.
ACT.27.29	At this rate they were afraid we would soon be driven against the rocks along the shore, so they threw out four anchors from the back of the ship and prayed for daylight.
ACT.27.30	Then the sailors tried to abandon the ship; they lowered the lifeboat as though they were going to put out anchors from the front of the ship. 
ACT.27.31	But Paul said to the commanding officer and the soldiers, “You will all die unless the sailors stay aboard.” 
ACT.27.32	So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and let it drift away.
ACT.27.33	Just as day was dawning, Paul urged everyone to eat. “You have been so worried that you haven’t touched food for two weeks,” he said. 
ACT.27.34	“Please eat something now for your own good. For not a hair of your heads will perish.” 
ACT.27.35	Then he took some bread, gave thanks to God before them all, and broke off a piece and ate it. 
ACT.27.36	Then everyone was encouraged and began to eat—
ACT.27.37	all 276 of us who were on board. 
ACT.27.38	After eating, the crew lightened the ship further by throwing the cargo of wheat overboard.
ACT.27.39	When morning dawned, they didn’t recognize the coastline, but they saw a bay with a beach and wondered if they could get to shore by running the ship aground. 
ACT.27.40	So they cut off the anchors and left them in the sea. Then they lowered the rudders, raised the foresail, and headed toward shore. 
ACT.27.41	But they hit a shoal and ran the ship aground too soon. The bow of the ship stuck fast, while the stern was repeatedly smashed by the force of the waves and began to break apart.
ACT.27.42	The soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners to make sure they didn’t swim ashore and escape. 
ACT.27.43	But the commanding officer wanted to spare Paul, so he didn’t let them carry out their plan. Then he ordered all who could swim to jump overboard first and make for land. 
ACT.27.44	The others held on to planks or debris from the broken ship.
ACT.28.1	Once we were safe on shore, we learned that we were on the island of Malta. 
ACT.28.2	The people of the island were very kind to us. It was cold and rainy, so they built a fire on the shore to welcome us.
ACT.28.3	As Paul gathered an armful of sticks and was laying them on the fire, a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, bit him on the hand. 
ACT.28.4	The people of the island saw it hanging from his hand and said to each other, “A murderer, no doubt! Though he escaped the sea, justice will not permit him to live.” 
ACT.28.5	But Paul shook off the snake into the fire and was unharmed. 
ACT.28.6	The people waited for him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw that he wasn’t harmed, they changed their minds and decided he was a god.
ACT.28.7	Near the shore where we landed was an estate belonging to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us and treated us kindly for three days. 
ACT.28.8	As it happened, Publius’s father was ill with fever and dysentery. Paul went in and prayed for him, and laying his hands on him, he healed him. 
ACT.28.9	Then all the other sick people on the island came and were healed. 
ACT.28.10	As a result we were showered with honors, and when the time came to sail, people supplied us with everything we would need for the trip.
ACT.28.11	It was three months after the shipwreck that we set sail on another ship that had wintered at the island—an Alexandrian ship with the twin gods
ACT.28.12	Our first stop was Syracuse,
ACT.28.13	From there we sailed across to Rhegium.
ACT.28.14	There we found some believers,
ACT.28.15	The brothers and sisters
ACT.28.16	When we arrived in Rome, Paul was permitted to have his own private lodging, though he was guarded by a soldier.
ACT.28.17	Three days after Paul’s arrival, he called together the local Jewish leaders. He said to them, “Brothers, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Roman government, even though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors. 
ACT.28.18	The Romans tried me and wanted to release me, because they found no cause for the death sentence. 
ACT.28.19	But when the Jewish leaders protested the decision, I felt it necessary to appeal to Caesar, even though I had no desire to press charges against my own people. 
ACT.28.20	I asked you to come here today so we could get acquainted and so I could explain to you that I am bound with this chain because I believe that the hope of Israel—the Messiah—has already come.”
ACT.28.21	They replied, “We have had no letters from Judea or reports against you from anyone who has come here. 
ACT.28.22	But we want to hear what you believe, for the only thing we know about this movement is that it is denounced everywhere.”
ACT.28.23	So a time was set, and on that day a large number of people came to Paul’s lodging. He explained and testified about the Kingdom of God and tried to persuade them about Jesus from the Scriptures. Using the law of Moses and the books of the prophets, he spoke to them from morning until evening. 
ACT.28.24	Some were persuaded by the things he said, but others did not believe. 
ACT.28.25	And after they had argued back and forth among themselves, they left with this final word from Paul: “The Holy Spirit was right when he said to your ancestors through Isaiah the prophet,
ACT.28.26	‘Go and say to this people:
ACT.28.26	When you hear what I say,
ACT.28.26	you will not understand.
ACT.28.26	When you see what I do,
ACT.28.26	you will not comprehend.
ACT.28.27	For the hearts of these people are hardened,
ACT.28.27	and their ears cannot hear,
ACT.28.27	and they have closed their eyes—
ACT.28.27	so their eyes cannot see,
ACT.28.27	and their ears cannot hear,
ACT.28.27	and their hearts cannot understand,
ACT.28.27	and they cannot turn to me
ACT.28.27	and let me heal them.’
ACT.28.28	So I want you to know that this salvation from God has also been offered to the Gentiles, and they will accept it.”
ACT.28.30	For the next two years, Paul lived in Rome at his own expense.
ACT.28.31	boldly proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ. And no one tried to stop him.
ROM.1.1	This letter is from Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, chosen by God to be an apostle and sent out to preach his Good News. 
ROM.1.2	God promised this Good News long ago through his prophets in the holy Scriptures. 
ROM.1.3	The Good News is about his Son. In his earthly life he was born into King David’s family line, 
ROM.1.4	and he was shown to be
ROM.1.5	Through Christ, God has given us the privilege
ROM.1.6	And you are included among those Gentiles who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ. 
ROM.1.7	I am writing to all of you in Rome who are loved by God and are called to be his own holy people.
ROM.1.7	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
ROM.1.8	Let me say first that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith in him is being talked about all over the world. 
ROM.1.9	God knows how often I pray for you. Day and night I bring you and your needs in prayer to God, whom I serve with all my heart
ROM.1.10	One of the things I always pray for is the opportunity, God willing, to come at last to see you. 
ROM.1.11	For I long to visit you so I can bring you some spiritual gift that will help you grow strong in the Lord. 
ROM.1.12	When we get together, I want to encourage you in your faith, but I also want to be encouraged by yours.
ROM.1.13	I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters,
ROM.1.14	For I have a great sense of obligation to people in both the civilized world and the rest of the world,
ROM.1.15	So I am eager to come to you in Rome, too, to preach the Good News.
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes—the Jew first and also the Gentile.
ROM.1.17	This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”
ROM.1.18	But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who suppress the truth by their wickedness.
ROM.1.19	They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them. 
ROM.1.20	For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God.
ROM.1.21	Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn’t worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused. 
ROM.1.22	Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools. 
ROM.1.23	And instead of worshiping the glorious, ever-living God, they worshiped idols made to look like mere people and birds and animals and reptiles.
ROM.1.24	So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other’s bodies. 
ROM.1.25	They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the Creator himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen. 
ROM.1.26	That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other. 
ROM.1.27	And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved.
ROM.1.28	Since they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that should never be done. 
ROM.1.29	Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip. 
ROM.1.30	They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents. 
ROM.1.31	They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no mercy. 
ROM.1.32	They know God’s justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die, yet they do them anyway. Worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.
ROM.2.1	You may think you can condemn such people, but you are just as bad, and you have no excuse! When you say they are wicked and should be punished, you are condemning yourself, for you who judge others do these very same things. 
ROM.2.2	And we know that God, in his justice, will punish anyone who does such things. 
ROM.2.3	Since you judge others for doing these things, why do you think you can avoid God’s judgment when you do the same things? 
ROM.2.4	Don’t you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can’t you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?
ROM.2.5	But because you are stubborn and refuse to turn from your sin, you are storing up terrible punishment for yourself. For a day of anger is coming, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed. 
ROM.2.6	He will judge everyone according to what they have done. 
ROM.2.7	He will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good, seeking after the glory and honor and immortality that God offers. 
ROM.2.8	But he will pour out his anger and wrath on those who live for themselves, who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness. 
ROM.2.9	There will be trouble and calamity for everyone who keeps on doing what is evil—for the Jew first and also for the Gentile.
ROM.2.10	But there will be glory and honor and peace from God for all who do good—for the Jew first and also for the Gentile. 
ROM.2.11	For God does not show favoritism.
ROM.2.12	When the Gentiles sin, they will be destroyed, even though they never had God’s written law. And the Jews, who do have God’s law, will be judged by that law when they fail to obey it. 
ROM.2.13	For merely listening to the law doesn’t make us right with God. It is obeying the law that makes us right in his sight. 
ROM.2.14	Even Gentiles, who do not have God’s written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it. 
ROM.2.15	They demonstrate that God’s law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right. 
ROM.2.16	And this is the message I proclaim—that the day is coming when God, through Christ Jesus, will judge everyone’s secret life.
ROM.2.17	You who call yourselves Jews are relying on God’s law, and you boast about your special relationship with him. 
ROM.2.18	You know what he wants; you know what is right because you have been taught his law. 
ROM.2.19	You are convinced that you are a guide for the blind and a light for people who are lost in darkness. 
ROM.2.20	You think you can instruct the ignorant and teach children the ways of God. For you are certain that God’s law gives you complete knowledge and truth.
ROM.2.21	Well then, if you teach others, why don’t you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but do you steal? 
ROM.2.22	You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you commit adultery? You condemn idolatry, but do you use items stolen from pagan temples?
ROM.2.23	You are so proud of knowing the law, but you dishonor God by breaking it. 
ROM.2.24	No wonder the Scriptures say, “The Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you.”
ROM.2.25	The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God’s law. But if you don’t obey God’s law, you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile. 
ROM.2.26	And if the Gentiles obey God’s law, won’t God declare them to be his own people? 
ROM.2.27	In fact, uncircumcised Gentiles who keep God’s law will condemn you Jews who are circumcised and possess God’s law but don’t obey it.
ROM.2.28	For you are not a true Jew just because you were born of Jewish parents or because you have gone through the ceremony of circumcision. 
ROM.2.29	No, a true Jew is one whose heart is right with God. And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law; rather, it is a change of heart produced by the Spirit. And a person with a changed heart seeks praise
ROM.3.1	Then what’s the advantage of being a Jew? Is there any value in the ceremony of circumcision? 
ROM.3.2	Yes, there are great benefits! First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the whole revelation of God.
ROM.3.3	True, some of them were unfaithful; but just because they were unfaithful, does that mean God will be unfaithful? 
ROM.3.4	Of course not! Even if everyone else is a liar, God is true. As the Scriptures say about him, 
ROM.3.4	“You will be proved right in what you say,
ROM.3.4	and you will win your case in court.”
ROM.3.5	“But,” some might say, “our sinfulness serves a good purpose, for it helps people see how righteous God is. Isn’t it unfair, then, for him to punish us?” (This is merely a human point of view.) 
ROM.3.6	Of course not! If God were not entirely fair, how would he be qualified to judge the world? 
ROM.3.7	“But,” someone might still argue, “how can God condemn me as a sinner if my dishonesty highlights his truthfulness and brings him more glory?” 
ROM.3.8	And some people even slander us by claiming that we say, “The more we sin, the better it is!” Those who say such things deserve to be condemned.
ROM.3.9	Well then, should we conclude that we Jews are better than others? No, not at all, for we have already shown that all people, whether Jews or Gentiles,
ROM.3.10	As the Scriptures say,
ROM.3.10	“No one is righteous—
ROM.3.10	not even one.
ROM.3.11	No one is truly wise;
ROM.3.11	no one is seeking God.
ROM.3.12	All have turned away;
ROM.3.12	all have become useless.
ROM.3.12	No one does good,
ROM.3.12	not a single one.”
ROM.3.13	“Their talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave.
ROM.3.13	Their tongues are filled with lies.”
ROM.3.13	“Snake venom drips from their lips.”
ROM.3.14	“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”
ROM.3.15	“They rush to commit murder.
ROM.3.16	Destruction and misery always follow them.
ROM.3.17	They don’t know where to find peace.”
ROM.3.18	“They have no fear of God at all.”
ROM.3.19	Obviously, the law applies to those to whom it was given, for its purpose is to keep people from having excuses, and to show that the entire world is guilty before God. 
ROM.3.20	For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands. The law simply shows us how sinful we are.
ROM.3.21	But now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the requirements of the law, as was promised in the writings of Moses
ROM.3.22	We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are.
ROM.3.23	For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God’s glorious standard. 
ROM.3.24	Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins. 
ROM.3.25	For God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life, shedding his blood. This sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past, 
ROM.3.26	for he was looking ahead and including them in what he would do in this present time. God did this to demonstrate his righteousness, for he himself is fair and just, and he makes sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus.
ROM.3.27	Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on obeying the law. It is based on faith. 
ROM.3.28	So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law.
ROM.3.29	After all, is God the God of the Jews only? Isn’t he also the God of the Gentiles? Of course he is. 
ROM.3.30	There is only one God, and he makes people right with himself only by faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles.
ROM.3.31	Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law.
ROM.4.1	Abraham was, humanly speaking, the founder of our Jewish nation. What did he discover about being made right with God? 
ROM.4.2	If his good deeds had made him acceptable to God, he would have had something to boast about. But that was not God’s way. 
ROM.4.3	For the Scriptures tell us, “Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.”
ROM.4.4	When people work, their wages are not a gift, but something they have earned. 
ROM.4.5	But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners. 
ROM.4.6	David also spoke of this when he described the happiness of those who are declared righteous without working for it:
ROM.4.7	“Oh, what joy for those
ROM.4.7	whose disobedience is forgiven,
ROM.4.7	whose sins are put out of sight.
ROM.4.8	Yes, what joy for those
ROM.4.8	whose record the 
ROM.4.9	Now, is this blessing only for the Jews, or is it also for uncircumcised Gentiles?
ROM.4.10	But how did this happen? Was he counted as righteous only after he was circumcised, or was it before he was circumcised? Clearly, God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised!
ROM.4.11	Circumcision was a sign that Abraham already had faith and that God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous—even before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the spiritual father of those who have faith but have not been circumcised. They are counted as righteous because of their faith. 
ROM.4.12	And Abraham is also the spiritual father of those who have been circumcised, but only if they have the same kind of faith Abraham had before he was circumcised.
ROM.4.13	Clearly, God’s promise to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was based not on his obedience to God’s law, but on a right relationship with God that comes by faith. 
ROM.4.14	If God’s promise is only for those who obey the law, then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless. 
ROM.4.15	For the law always brings punishment on those who try to obey it. (The only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break!)
ROM.4.16	So the promise is received by faith. It is given as a free gift. And we are all certain to receive it, whether or not we live according to the law of Moses, if we have faith like Abraham’s. For Abraham is the father of all who believe. 
ROM.4.17	That is what the Scriptures mean when God told him, “I have made you the father of many nations.”
ROM.4.18	Even when there was no reason for hope, Abraham kept hoping—believing that he would become the father of many nations. For God had said to him, “That’s how many descendants you will have!”
ROM.4.19	And Abraham’s faith did not weaken, even though, at about 100 years of age, he figured his body was as good as dead—and so was Sarah’s womb.
ROM.4.20	Abraham never wavered in believing God’s promise. In fact, his faith grew stronger, and in this he brought glory to God. 
ROM.4.21	He was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises. 
ROM.4.22	And because of Abraham’s faith, God counted him as righteous. 
ROM.4.23	And when God counted him as righteous, it wasn’t just for Abraham’s benefit. It was recorded 
ROM.4.24	for our benefit, too, assuring us that God will also count us as righteous if we believe in him, the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. 
ROM.4.25	He was handed over to die because of our sins, and he was raised to life to make us right with God.
ROM.5.1	Therefore, since we have been made right in God’s sight by faith, we have peace
ROM.5.2	Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God’s glory.
ROM.5.3	We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. 
ROM.5.4	And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. 
ROM.5.5	And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.
ROM.5.6	When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners. 
ROM.5.7	Now, most people would not be willing to die for an upright person, though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good. 
ROM.5.8	But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners. 
ROM.5.9	And since we have been made right in God’s sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God’s condemnation. 
ROM.5.10	For since our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be saved through the life of his Son. 
ROM.5.11	So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends of God.
ROM.5.12	When Adam sinned, sin entered the world. Adam’s sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned. 
ROM.5.13	Yes, people sinned even before the law was given. But it was not counted as sin because there was not yet any law to break. 
ROM.5.14	Still, everyone died—from the time of Adam to the time of Moses—even those who did not disobey an explicit commandment of God, as Adam did. Now Adam is a symbol, a representation of Christ, who was yet to come. 
ROM.5.15	But there is a great difference between Adam’s sin and God’s gracious gift. For the sin of this one man, Adam, brought death to many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and his gift of forgiveness to many through this other man, Jesus Christ. 
ROM.5.16	And the result of God’s gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man’s sin. For Adam’s sin led to condemnation, but God’s free gift leads to our being made right with God, even though we are guilty of many sins. 
ROM.5.17	For the sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to rule over many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and his gift of righteousness, for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man, Jesus Christ.
ROM.5.18	Yes, Adam’s one sin brings condemnation for everyone, but Christ’s one act of righteousness brings a right relationship with God and new life for everyone. 
ROM.5.19	Because one person disobeyed God, many became sinners. But because one other person obeyed God, many will be made righteous.
ROM.5.20	God’s law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God’s wonderful grace became more abundant. 
ROM.5.21	So just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God’s wonderful grace rules instead, giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? 
ROM.6.2	Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it? 
ROM.6.3	Or have you forgotten that when we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism, we joined him in his death? 
ROM.6.4	For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now we also may live new lives.
ROM.6.5	Since we have been united with him in his death, we will also be raised to life as he was. 
ROM.6.6	We know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin. 
ROM.6.7	For when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin. 
ROM.6.8	And since we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him. 
ROM.6.9	We are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead, and he will never die again. Death no longer has any power over him. 
ROM.6.10	When he died, he died once to break the power of sin. But now that he lives, he lives for the glory of God. 
ROM.6.11	So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus.
ROM.6.12	Do not let sin control the way you live;
ROM.6.13	Do not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve sin. Instead, give yourselves completely to God, for you were dead, but now you have new life. So use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God. 
ROM.6.14	Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God’s grace.
ROM.6.15	Well then, since God’s grace has set us free from the law, does that mean we can go on sinning? Of course not! 
ROM.6.16	Don’t you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living. 
ROM.6.17	Thank God! Once you were slaves of sin, but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you. 
ROM.6.18	Now you are free from your slavery to sin, and you have become slaves to righteous living.
ROM.6.19	Because of the weakness of your human nature, I am using the illustration of slavery to help you understand all this. Previously, you let yourselves be slaves to impurity and lawlessness, which led ever deeper into sin. Now you must give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy.
ROM.6.20	When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the obligation to do right. 
ROM.6.21	And what was the result? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom. 
ROM.6.22	But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God. Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life. 
ROM.6.23	For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.7.1	Now, dear brothers and sisters
ROM.7.2	For example, when a woman marries, the law binds her to her husband as long as he is alive. But if he dies, the laws of marriage no longer apply to her. 
ROM.7.3	So while her husband is alive, she would be committing adultery if she married another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law and does not commit adultery when she remarries.
ROM.7.4	So, my dear brothers and sisters, this is the point: You died to the power of the law when you died with Christ. And now you are united with the one who was raised from the dead. As a result, we can produce a harvest of good deeds for God. 
ROM.7.5	When we were controlled by our old nature,
ROM.7.6	But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power. Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit.
ROM.7.7	Well then, am I suggesting that the law of God is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that showed me my sin. I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said, “You must not covet.”
ROM.7.8	But sin used this command to arouse all kinds of covetous desires within me! If there were no law, sin would not have that power. 
ROM.7.9	At one time I lived without understanding the law. But when I learned the command not to covet, for instance, the power of sin came to life, 
ROM.7.10	and I died. So I discovered that the law’s commands, which were supposed to bring life, brought spiritual death instead. 
ROM.7.11	Sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me; it used the commands to kill me. 
ROM.7.12	But still, the law itself is holy, and its commands are holy and right and good.
ROM.7.13	But how can that be? Did the law, which is good, cause my death? Of course not! Sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation to death. So we can see how terrible sin really is. It uses God’s good commands for its own evil purposes.
ROM.7.14	So the trouble is not with the law, for it is spiritual and good. The trouble is with me, for I am all too human, a slave to sin. 
ROM.7.15	I don’t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don’t do it. Instead, I do what I hate. 
ROM.7.16	But if I know that what I am doing is wrong, this shows that I agree that the law is good. 
ROM.7.17	So I am not the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it.
ROM.7.18	And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.
ROM.7.19	I want to do what is good, but I don’t. I don’t want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway. 
ROM.7.20	But if I do what I don’t want to do, I am not really the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it.
ROM.7.21	I have discovered this principle of life—that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong. 
ROM.7.22	I love God’s law with all my heart. 
ROM.7.23	But there is another power
ROM.7.24	Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death? 
ROM.7.25	Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In my mind I really want to obey God’s law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin.
ROM.8.1	So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus. 
ROM.8.2	And because you belong to him, the power
ROM.8.3	The law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature.
ROM.8.4	He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit.
ROM.8.5	Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit. 
ROM.8.6	So letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace. 
ROM.8.7	For the sinful nature is always hostile to God. It never did obey God’s laws, and it never will. 
ROM.8.8	That’s why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God.
ROM.8.9	But you are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all.) 
ROM.8.10	And Christ lives within you, so even though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life
ROM.8.11	The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. And just as God raised Christ Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your mortal bodies by this same Spirit living within you.
ROM.8.12	Therefore, dear brothers and sisters,
ROM.8.13	For if you live by its dictates, you will die. But if through the power of the Spirit you put to death the deeds of your sinful nature,
ROM.8.14	For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children
ROM.8.15	So you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead, you received God’s Spirit when he adopted you as his own children.
ROM.8.16	For his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God’s children. 
ROM.8.17	And since we are his children, we are his heirs. In fact, together with Christ we are heirs of God’s glory. But if we are to share his glory, we must also share his suffering.
ROM.8.18	Yet what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will reveal to us later. 
ROM.8.19	For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal who his children really are. 
ROM.8.20	Against its will, all creation was subjected to God’s curse. But with eager hope, 
ROM.8.21	the creation looks forward to the day when it will join God’s children in glorious freedom from death and decay. 
ROM.8.22	For we know that all creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. 
ROM.8.23	And we believers also groan, even though we have the Holy Spirit within us as a foretaste of future glory, for we long for our bodies to be released from sin and suffering. We, too, wait with eager hope for the day when God will give us our full rights as his adopted children,
ROM.8.24	We were given this hope when we were saved. (If we already have something, we don’t need to hope
ROM.8.25	But if we look forward to something we don’t yet have, we must wait patiently and confidently.)
ROM.8.26	And the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness. For example, we don’t know what God wants us to pray for. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words. 
ROM.8.27	And the Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers
ROM.8.28	And we know that God causes everything to work together
ROM.8.29	For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his Son would be the firstborn
ROM.8.30	And having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And having called them, he gave them right standing with himself. And having given them right standing, he gave them his glory.
ROM.8.31	What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us? 
ROM.8.32	Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won’t he also give us everything else? 
ROM.8.33	Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? No one—for God himself has given us right standing with himself. 
ROM.8.34	Who then will condemn us? No one—for Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of honor at God’s right hand, pleading for us.
ROM.8.35	Can anything ever separate us from Christ’s love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death? 
ROM.8.36	(As the Scriptures say, “For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep.”
ROM.8.37	No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.
ROM.8.38	And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,
ROM.8.39	No power in the sky above or in the earth below—indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	With Christ as my witness, I speak with utter truthfulness. My conscience and the Holy Spirit confirm it. 
ROM.9.2	My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending grief 
ROM.9.3	for my people, my Jewish brothers and sisters.
ROM.9.4	They are the people of Israel, chosen to be God’s adopted children.
ROM.9.5	Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are their ancestors, and Christ himself was an Israelite as far as his human nature is concerned. And he is God, the one who rules over everything and is worthy of eternal praise! Amen.
ROM.9.6	Well then, has God failed to fulfill his promise to Israel? No, for not all who are born into the nation of Israel are truly members of God’s people! 
ROM.9.7	Being descendants of Abraham doesn’t make them truly Abraham’s children. For the Scriptures say, “Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted,”
ROM.9.8	This means that Abraham’s physical descendants are not necessarily children of God. Only the children of the promise are considered to be Abraham’s children. 
ROM.9.9	For God had promised, “I will return about this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.”
ROM.9.10	This son was our ancestor Isaac. When he married Rebekah, she gave birth to twins.
ROM.9.11	But before they were born, before they had done anything good or bad, she received a message from God. (This message shows that God chooses people according to his own purposes; 
ROM.9.12	he calls people, but not according to their good or bad works.) She was told, “Your older son will serve your younger son.”
ROM.9.13	In the words of the Scriptures, “I loved Jacob, but I rejected Esau.”
ROM.9.14	Are we saying, then, that God was unfair? Of course not! 
ROM.9.15	For God said to Moses,
ROM.9.15	“I will show mercy to anyone I choose,
ROM.9.15	and I will show compassion to anyone I choose.”
ROM.9.16	So it is God who decides to show mercy. We can neither choose it nor work for it.
ROM.9.17	For the Scriptures say that God told Pharaoh, “I have appointed you for the very purpose of displaying my power in you and to spread my fame throughout the earth.”
ROM.9.18	So you see, God chooses to show mercy to some, and he chooses to harden the hearts of others so they refuse to listen.
ROM.9.19	Well then, you might say, “Why does God blame people for not responding? Haven’t they simply done what he makes them do?”
ROM.9.20	No, don’t say that. Who are you, a mere human being, to argue with God? Should the thing that was created say to the one who created it, “Why have you made me like this?” 
ROM.9.21	When a potter makes jars out of clay, doesn’t he have a right to use the same lump of clay to make one jar for decoration and another to throw garbage into? 
ROM.9.22	In the same way, even though God has the right to show his anger and his power, he is very patient with those on whom his anger falls, who are destined for destruction. 
ROM.9.23	He does this to make the riches of his glory shine even brighter on those to whom he shows mercy, who were prepared in advance for glory. 
ROM.9.24	And we are among those whom he selected, both from the Jews and from the Gentiles.
ROM.9.25	Concerning the Gentiles, God says in the prophecy of Hosea,
ROM.9.25	“Those who were not my people,
ROM.9.25	I will now call my people.
ROM.9.25	And I will love those
ROM.9.25	whom I did not love before.”
ROM.9.26	And,
ROM.9.26	“Then, at the place where they were told,
ROM.9.26	‘You are not my people,’
ROM.9.26	there they will be called
ROM.9.26	‘children of the living God.’”
ROM.9.27	And concerning Israel, Isaiah the prophet cried out,
ROM.9.27	“Though the people of Israel are as numerous as the sand of the seashore,
ROM.9.27	only a remnant will be saved.
ROM.9.28	For the 
ROM.9.28	quickly and with finality.”
ROM.9.29	And Isaiah said the same thing in another place:
ROM.9.29	“If the 
ROM.9.29	had not spared a few of our children,
ROM.9.29	we would have been wiped out like Sodom,
ROM.9.29	destroyed like Gomorrah.”
ROM.9.30	What does all this mean? Even though the Gentiles were not trying to follow God’s standards, they were made right with God. And it was by faith that this took place. 
ROM.9.31	But the people of Israel, who tried so hard to get right with God by keeping the law, never succeeded. 
ROM.9.32	Why not? Because they were trying to get right with God by keeping the law
ROM.9.33	God warned them of this in the Scriptures when he said, 
ROM.9.33	“I am placing a stone in Jerusalem
ROM.9.33	a rock that makes them fall.
ROM.9.33	But anyone who trusts in him
ROM.9.33	will never be disgraced.”
ROM.10.1	Dear brothers and sisters,
ROM.10.2	I know what enthusiasm they have for God, but it is misdirected zeal. 
ROM.10.3	For they don’t understand God’s way of making people right with himself. Refusing to accept God’s way, they cling to their own way of getting right with God by trying to keep the law. 
ROM.10.4	For Christ has already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given.
ROM.10.5	For Moses writes that the law’s way of making a person right with God requires obedience to all of its commands.
ROM.10.6	But faith’s way of getting right with God says, “Don’t say in your heart, ‘Who will go up to heaven?’ (to bring Christ down to earth). 
ROM.10.7	And don’t say, ‘Who will go down to the place of the dead?’ (to bring Christ back to life again).” 
ROM.10.8	In fact, it says,
ROM.10.8	“The message is very close at hand;
ROM.10.8	it is on your lips and in your heart.”
ROM.10.8	And that message is the very message about faith that we preach: 
ROM.10.9	If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 
ROM.10.10	For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. 
ROM.10.11	As the Scriptures tell us, “Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.”
ROM.10.12	Jew and Gentile
ROM.10.13	For “Everyone who calls on the name of the 
ROM.10.14	But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? 
ROM.10.15	And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the Scriptures say, “How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news!”
ROM.10.16	But not everyone welcomes the Good News, for Isaiah the prophet said, “
ROM.10.17	So faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ. 
ROM.10.18	But I ask, have the people of Israel actually heard the message? Yes, they have:
ROM.10.18	“The message has gone throughout the earth,
ROM.10.18	and the words to all the world.”
ROM.10.19	But I ask, did the people of Israel really understand? Yes, they did, for even in the time of Moses, God said, 
ROM.10.19	“I will rouse your jealousy through people who are not even a nation.
ROM.10.19	I will provoke your anger through the foolish Gentiles.”
ROM.10.20	And later Isaiah spoke boldly for God, saying,
ROM.10.20	“I was found by people who were not looking for me.
ROM.10.20	I showed myself to those who were not asking for me.”
ROM.10.21	But regarding Israel, God said,
ROM.10.21	“All day long I opened my arms to them,
ROM.10.21	but they were disobedient and rebellious.”
ROM.11.1	I ask, then, has God rejected his own people, the nation of Israel? Of course not! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham and a member of the tribe of Benjamin.
ROM.11.2	No, God has not rejected his own people, whom he chose from the very beginning. Do you realize what the Scriptures say about this? Elijah the prophet complained to God about the people of Israel and said, 
ROM.11.3	“
ROM.11.4	And do you remember God’s reply? He said, “No, I have 7,000 others who have never bowed down to Baal!”
ROM.11.5	It is the same today, for a few of the people of Israel
ROM.11.6	And since it is through God’s kindness, then it is not by their good works. For in that case, God’s grace would not be what it really is—free and undeserved.
ROM.11.7	So this is the situation: Most of the people of Israel have not found the favor of God they are looking for so earnestly. A few have—the ones God has chosen—but the hearts of the rest were hardened. 
ROM.11.8	As the Scriptures say,
ROM.11.8	“God has put them into a deep sleep.
ROM.11.8	To this day he has shut their eyes so they do not see,
ROM.11.8	and closed their ears so they do not hear.”
ROM.11.9	Likewise, David said,
ROM.11.9	“Let their bountiful table become a snare,
ROM.11.9	a trap that makes them think all is well.
ROM.11.9	Let their blessings cause them to stumble,
ROM.11.9	and let them get what they deserve.
ROM.11.10	Let their eyes go blind so they cannot see,
ROM.11.10	and let their backs be bent forever.”
ROM.11.11	Did God’s people stumble and fall beyond recovery? Of course not! They were disobedient, so God made salvation available to the Gentiles. But he wanted his own people to become jealous and claim it for themselves. 
ROM.11.12	Now if the Gentiles were enriched because the people of Israel turned down God’s offer of salvation, think how much greater a blessing the world will share when they finally accept it.
ROM.11.13	I am saying all this especially for you Gentiles. God has appointed me as the apostle to the Gentiles. I stress this, 
ROM.11.14	for I want somehow to make the people of Israel jealous of what you Gentiles have, so I might save some of them. 
ROM.11.15	For since their rejection meant that God offered salvation to the rest of the world, their acceptance will be even more wonderful. It will be life for those who were dead! 
ROM.11.16	And since Abraham and the other patriarchs were holy, their descendants will also be holy—just as the entire batch of dough is holy because the portion given as an offering is holy. For if the roots of the tree are holy, the branches will be, too.
ROM.11.17	But some of these branches from Abraham’s tree—some of the people of Israel—have been broken off. And you Gentiles, who were branches from a wild olive tree, have been grafted in. So now you also receive the blessing God has promised Abraham and his children, sharing in the rich nourishment from the root of God’s special olive tree. 
ROM.11.18	But you must not brag about being grafted in to replace the branches that were broken off. You are just a branch, not the root.
ROM.11.19	“Well,” you may say, “those branches were broken off to make room for me.” 
ROM.11.20	Yes, but remember—those branches were broken off because they didn’t believe in Christ, and you are there because you do believe. So don’t think highly of yourself, but fear what could happen. 
ROM.11.21	For if God did not spare the original branches, he won’t
ROM.11.22	Notice how God is both kind and severe. He is severe toward those who disobeyed, but kind to you if you continue to trust in his kindness. But if you stop trusting, you also will be cut off. 
ROM.11.23	And if the people of Israel turn from their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, for God has the power to graft them back into the tree. 
ROM.11.24	You, by nature, were a branch cut from a wild olive tree. So if God was willing to do something contrary to nature by grafting you into his cultivated tree, he will be far more eager to graft the original branches back into the tree where they belong.
ROM.11.25	I want you to understand this mystery, dear brothers and sisters,
ROM.11.26	And so all Israel will be saved. As the Scriptures say,
ROM.11.26	“The one who rescues will come from Jerusalem,
ROM.11.26	and he will turn Israel
ROM.11.27	And this is my covenant with them,
ROM.11.27	that I will take away their sins.”
ROM.11.28	Many of the people of Israel are now enemies of the Good News, and this benefits you Gentiles. Yet they are still the people he loves because he chose their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
ROM.11.29	For God’s gifts and his call can never be withdrawn. 
ROM.11.30	Once, you Gentiles were rebels against God, but when the people of Israel rebelled against him, God was merciful to you instead. 
ROM.11.31	Now they are the rebels, and God’s mercy has come to you so that they, too, will share
ROM.11.32	For God has imprisoned everyone in disobedience so he could have mercy on everyone.
ROM.11.33	Oh, how great are God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How impossible it is for us to understand his decisions and his ways!
ROM.11.34	For who can know the 
ROM.11.34	Who knows enough to give him advice?
ROM.11.35	And who has given him so much
ROM.11.35	that he needs to pay it back?
ROM.11.36	For everything comes from him and exists by his power and is intended for his glory. All glory to him forever! Amen.
ROM.12.1	And so, dear brothers and sisters,
ROM.12.2	Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.
ROM.12.3	Because of the privilege and authority
ROM.12.4	Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function, 
ROM.12.5	so it is with Christ’s body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other.
ROM.12.6	In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as God has given you. 
ROM.12.7	If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, teach well. 
ROM.12.8	If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. If it is giving, give generously. If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others, do it gladly.
ROM.12.9	Don’t just pretend to love others. Really love them. Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good. 
ROM.12.10	Love each other with genuine affection,
ROM.12.11	Never be lazy, but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically.
ROM.12.12	Rejoice in our confident hope. Be patient in trouble, and keep on praying. 
ROM.12.13	When God’s people are in need, be ready to help them. Always be eager to practice hospitality.
ROM.12.14	Bless those who persecute you. Don’t curse them; pray that God will bless them. 
ROM.12.15	Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep. 
ROM.12.16	Live in harmony with each other. Don’t be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don’t think you know it all!
ROM.12.17	Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honorable. 
ROM.12.18	Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone.
ROM.12.19	Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say,
ROM.12.19	“I will take revenge;
ROM.12.19	I will pay them back,”
ROM.12.19	says the 
ROM.12.20	Instead, 
ROM.12.20	“If your enemies are hungry, feed them.
ROM.12.20	If they are thirsty, give them something to drink.
ROM.12.20	In doing this, you will heap
ROM.12.20	burning coals of shame on their heads.”
ROM.12.21	Don’t let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.
ROM.13.1	Everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God. 
ROM.13.2	So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will be punished. 
ROM.13.3	For the authorities do not strike fear in people who are doing right, but in those who are doing wrong. Would you like to live without fear of the authorities? Do what is right, and they will honor you. 
ROM.13.4	The authorities are God’s servants, sent for your good. But if you are doing wrong, of course you should be afraid, for they have the power to punish you. They are God’s servants, sent for the very purpose of punishing those who do what is wrong. 
ROM.13.5	So you must submit to them, not only to avoid punishment, but also to keep a clear conscience.
ROM.13.6	Pay your taxes, too, for these same reasons. For government workers need to be paid. They are serving God in what they do. 
ROM.13.7	Give to everyone what you owe them: Pay your taxes and government fees to those who collect them, and give respect and honor to those who are in authority.
ROM.13.8	Owe nothing to anyone—except for your obligation to love one another. If you love your neighbor, you will fulfill the requirements of God’s law. 
ROM.13.9	For the commandments say, “You must not commit adultery. You must not murder. You must not steal. You must not covet.”
ROM.13.10	Love does no wrong to others, so love fulfills the requirements of God’s law.
ROM.13.11	This is all the more urgent, for you know how late it is; time is running out. Wake up, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. 
ROM.13.12	The night is almost gone; the day of salvation will soon be here. So remove your dark deeds like dirty clothes, and put on the shining armor of right living. 
ROM.13.13	Because we belong to the day, we must live decent lives for all to see. Don’t participate in the darkness of wild parties and drunkenness, or in sexual promiscuity and immoral living, or in quarreling and jealousy. 
ROM.13.14	Instead, clothe yourself with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. And don’t let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires.
ROM.14.1	Accept other believers who are weak in faith, and don’t argue with them about what they think is right or wrong. 
ROM.14.2	For instance, one person believes it’s all right to eat anything. But another believer with a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables. 
ROM.14.3	Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who don’t. And those who don’t eat certain foods must not condemn those who do, for God has accepted them. 
ROM.14.4	Who are you to condemn someone else’s servants? Their own master will judge whether they stand or fall. And with the Lord’s help, they will stand and receive his approval.
ROM.14.5	In the same way, some think one day is more holy than another day, while others think every day is alike. You should each be fully convinced that whichever day you choose is acceptable. 
ROM.14.6	Those who worship the Lord on a special day do it to honor him. Those who eat any kind of food do so to honor the Lord, since they give thanks to God before eating. And those who refuse to eat certain foods also want to please the Lord and give thanks to God. 
ROM.14.7	For we don’t live for ourselves or die for ourselves. 
ROM.14.8	If we live, it’s to honor the Lord. And if we die, it’s to honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. 
ROM.14.9	Christ died and rose again for this very purpose—to be Lord both of the living and of the dead.
ROM.14.10	So why do you condemn another believer
ROM.14.11	For the Scriptures say, 
ROM.14.11	“‘As surely as I live,’ says the 
ROM.14.11	‘every knee will bend to me,
ROM.14.11	and every tongue will declare allegiance to God.
ROM.14.12	Yes, each of us will give a personal account to God. 
ROM.14.13	So let’s stop condemning each other. Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall.
ROM.14.14	I know and am convinced on the authority of the Lord Jesus that no food, in and of itself, is wrong to eat. But if someone believes it is wrong, then for that person it is wrong. 
ROM.14.15	And if another believer is distressed by what you eat, you are not acting in love if you eat it. Don’t let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died. 
ROM.14.16	Then you will not be criticized for doing something you believe is good. 
ROM.14.17	For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.14.18	If you serve Christ with this attitude, you will please God, and others will approve of you, too. 
ROM.14.19	So then, let us aim for harmony in the church and try to build each other up.
ROM.14.20	Don’t tear apart the work of God over what you eat. Remember, all foods are acceptable, but it is wrong to eat something if it makes another person stumble. 
ROM.14.21	It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble.
ROM.14.22	You may believe there’s nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it between yourself and God. Blessed are those who don’t feel guilty for doing something they have decided is right. 
ROM.14.23	But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are sinning if you go ahead and do it. For you are not following your convictions. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.
ROM.15.1	We who are strong must be considerate of those who are sensitive about things like this. We must not just please ourselves. 
ROM.15.2	We should help others do what is right and build them up in the Lord. 
ROM.15.3	For even Christ didn’t live to please himself. As the Scriptures say, “The insults of those who insult you, O God, have fallen on me.”
ROM.15.4	Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God’s promises to be fulfilled.
ROM.15.5	May God, who gives this patience and encouragement, help you live in complete harmony with each other, as is fitting for followers of Christ Jesus. 
ROM.15.6	Then all of you can join together with one voice, giving praise and glory to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.15.7	Therefore, accept each other just as Christ has accepted you so that God will be given glory. 
ROM.15.8	Remember that Christ came as a servant to the Jews
ROM.15.9	He also came so that the Gentiles might give glory to God for his mercies to them. That is what the psalmist meant when he wrote: 
ROM.15.9	“For this, I will praise you among the Gentiles;
ROM.15.9	I will sing praises to your name.”
ROM.15.10	And in another place it is written,
ROM.15.10	“Rejoice with his people,
ROM.15.10	you Gentiles.”
ROM.15.11	And yet again,
ROM.15.11	“Praise the 
ROM.15.11	Praise him, all you people of the earth.”
ROM.15.12	And in another place Isaiah said, 
ROM.15.12	“The heir to David’s throne
ROM.15.12	and he will rule over the Gentiles.
ROM.15.12	They will place their hope on him.”
ROM.15.13	I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.
ROM.15.14	I am fully convinced, my dear brothers and sisters,
ROM.15.15	Even so, I have been bold enough to write about some of these points, knowing that all you need is this reminder. For by God’s grace, 
ROM.15.16	I am a special messenger from Christ Jesus to you Gentiles. I bring you the Good News so that I might present you as an acceptable offering to God, made holy by the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.15.17	So I have reason to be enthusiastic about all Christ Jesus has done through me in my service to God. 
ROM.15.18	Yet I dare not boast about anything except what Christ has done through me, bringing the Gentiles to God by my message and by the way I worked among them. 
ROM.15.19	They were convinced by the power of miraculous signs and wonders and by the power of God’s Spirit.
ROM.15.20	My ambition has always been to preach the Good News where the name of Christ has never been heard, rather than where a church has already been started by someone else. 
ROM.15.21	I have been following the plan spoken of in the Scriptures, where it says, 
ROM.15.21	“Those who have never been told about him will see,
ROM.15.21	and those who have never heard of him will understand.”
ROM.15.22	In fact, my visit to you has been delayed so long because I have been preaching in these places.
ROM.15.23	But now I have finished my work in these regions, and after all these long years of waiting, I am eager to visit you. 
ROM.15.24	I am planning to go to Spain, and when I do, I will stop off in Rome. And after I have enjoyed your fellowship for a little while, you can provide for my journey.
ROM.15.25	But before I come, I must go to Jerusalem to take a gift to the believers
ROM.15.26	For you see, the believers in Macedonia and Achaia
ROM.15.27	They were glad to do this because they feel they owe a real debt to them. Since the Gentiles received the spiritual blessings of the Good News from the believers in Jerusalem, they feel the least they can do in return is to help them financially. 
ROM.15.28	As soon as I have delivered this money and completed this good deed of theirs, I will come to see you on my way to Spain. 
ROM.15.29	And I am sure that when I come, Christ will richly bless our time together.
ROM.15.30	Dear brothers and sisters, I urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to join in my struggle by praying to God for me. Do this because of your love for me, given to you by the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.15.31	Pray that I will be rescued from those in Judea who refuse to obey God. Pray also that the believers there will be willing to accept the donation
ROM.15.32	Then, by the will of God, I will be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and we will be an encouragement to each other.
ROM.15.33	And now may God, who gives us his peace, be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.1	I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deacon in the church in Cenchrea. 
ROM.16.2	Welcome her in the Lord as one who is worthy of honor among God’s people. Help her in whatever she needs, for she has been helpful to many, and especially to me.
ROM.16.3	Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in the ministry of Christ Jesus. 
ROM.16.4	In fact, they once risked their lives for me. I am thankful to them, and so are all the Gentile churches. 
ROM.16.5	Also give my greetings to the church that meets in their home.
ROM.16.5	Greet my dear friend Epenetus. He was the first person from the province of Asia to become a follower of Christ. 
ROM.16.6	Give my greetings to Mary, who has worked so hard for your benefit. 
ROM.16.7	Greet Andronicus and Junia,
ROM.16.8	Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
ROM.16.10	Greet Apelles, a good man whom Christ approves. And give my greetings to the believers from the household of Aristobulus. 
ROM.16.11	Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew.
ROM.16.12	Give my greetings to Tryphena and Tryphosa, the Lord’s workers, and to dear Persis, who has worked so hard for the Lord. 
ROM.16.13	Greet Rufus, whom the Lord picked out to be his very own; and also his dear mother, who has been a mother to me.
ROM.16.14	Give my greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters
ROM.16.15	Give my greetings to Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and to Olympas and all the believers
ROM.16.16	Greet each other with a sacred kiss. All the churches of Christ send you their greetings.
ROM.16.17	And now I make one more appeal, my dear brothers and sisters. Watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people’s faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught. Stay away from them. 
ROM.16.18	Such people are not serving Christ our Lord; they are serving their own personal interests. By smooth talk and glowing words they deceive innocent people. 
ROM.16.19	But everyone knows that you are obedient to the Lord. This makes me very happy. I want you to be wise in doing right and to stay innocent of any wrong. 
ROM.16.20	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus
ROM.16.21	Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you his greetings, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow Jews.
ROM.16.22	I, Tertius, the one writing this letter for Paul, send my greetings, too, as one of the Lord’s followers.
ROM.16.23	Gaius says hello to you. He is my host and also serves as host to the whole church. Erastus, the city treasurer, sends you his greetings, and so does our brother Quartus.
ROM.16.25	Now all glory to God, who is able to make you strong, just as my Good News says. This message about Jesus Christ has revealed his plan for you Gentiles, a plan kept secret from the beginning of time. 
ROM.16.26	But now as the prophets
ROM.16.27	All glory to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, forever. Amen.
1CO.1.1	This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Sosthenes.
1CO.1.2	I am writing to God’s church in Corinth,
1CO.1.3	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
1CO.1.4	I always thank my God for you and for the gracious gifts he has given you, now that you belong to Christ Jesus. 
1CO.1.5	Through him, God has enriched your church in every way—with all of your eloquent words and all of your knowledge. 
1CO.1.6	This confirms that what I told you about Christ is true. 
1CO.1.7	Now you have every spiritual gift you need as you eagerly wait for the return of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1CO.1.8	He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be free from all blame on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns. 
1CO.1.9	God will do this, for he is faithful to do what he says, and he has invited you into partnership with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
1CO.1.10	I appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.1.11	For some members of Chloe’s household have told me about your quarrels, my dear brothers and sisters. 
1CO.1.12	Some of you are saying, “I am a follower of Paul.” Others are saying, “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Peter,
1CO.1.13	Has Christ been divided into factions? Was I, Paul, crucified for you? Were any of you baptized in the name of Paul? Of course not! 
1CO.1.14	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 
1CO.1.15	for now no one can say they were baptized in my name. 
1CO.1.16	(Oh yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas, but I don’t remember baptizing anyone else.) 
1CO.1.17	For Christ didn’t send me to baptize, but to preach the Good News—and not with clever speech, for fear that the cross of Christ would lose its power.
1CO.1.18	The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God. 
1CO.1.19	As the Scriptures say,
1CO.1.19	“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise
1CO.1.19	and discard the intelligence of the intelligent.”
1CO.1.20	So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world’s brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish. 
1CO.1.21	Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe. 
1CO.1.22	It is foolish to the Jews, who ask for signs from heaven. And it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom. 
1CO.1.23	So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it’s all nonsense.
1CO.1.24	But to those called by God to salvation, both Jews and Gentiles,
1CO.1.25	This foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God’s weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength.
1CO.1.26	Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world’s eyes or powerful or wealthy
1CO.1.27	Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful. 
1CO.1.28	God chose things despised by the world,
1CO.1.29	As a result, no one can ever boast in the presence of God.
1CO.1.30	God has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made him to be wisdom itself. Christ made us right with God; he made us pure and holy, and he freed us from sin. 
1CO.1.31	Therefore, as the Scriptures say, “If you want to boast, boast only about the 
1CO.2.1	When I first came to you, dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.2.2	For I decided that while I was with you I would forget everything except Jesus Christ, the one who was crucified. 
1CO.2.3	I came to you in weakness—timid and trembling. 
1CO.2.4	And my message and my preaching were very plain. Rather than using clever and persuasive speeches, I relied only on the power of the Holy Spirit. 
1CO.2.5	I did this so you would trust not in human wisdom but in the power of God.
1CO.2.6	Yet when I am among mature believers, I do speak with words of wisdom, but not the kind of wisdom that belongs to this world or to the rulers of this world, who are soon forgotten. 
1CO.2.7	No, the wisdom we speak of is the mystery of God
1CO.2.8	But the rulers of this world have not understood it; if they had, they would not have crucified our glorious Lord. 
1CO.2.9	That is what the Scriptures mean when they say, 
1CO.2.9	“No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
1CO.2.9	and no mind has imagined
1CO.2.9	what God has prepared
1CO.2.9	for those who love him.”
1CO.2.10	But
1CO.2.11	No one can know a person’s thoughts except that person’s own spirit, and no one can know God’s thoughts except God’s own Spirit. 
1CO.2.12	And we have received God’s Spirit (not the world’s spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us.
1CO.2.13	When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit’s words to explain spiritual truths.
1CO.2.14	But people who aren’t spiritual
1CO.2.15	Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things, but they themselves cannot be evaluated by others. 
1CO.2.16	For,
1CO.2.16	“Who can know the 
1CO.2.16	Who knows enough to teach him?”
1CO.2.16	But we understand these things, for we have the mind of Christ.
1CO.3.1	Dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.3.2	I had to feed you with milk, not with solid food, because you weren’t ready for anything stronger. And you still aren’t ready, 
1CO.3.3	for you are still controlled by your sinful nature. You are jealous of one another and quarrel with each other. Doesn’t that prove you are controlled by your sinful nature? Aren’t you living like people of the world? 
1CO.3.4	When one of you says, “I am a follower of Paul,” and another says, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you acting just like people of the world?
1CO.3.5	After all, who is Apollos? Who is Paul? We are only God’s servants through whom you believed the Good News. Each of us did the work the Lord gave us. 
1CO.3.6	I planted the seed in your hearts, and Apollos watered it, but it was God who made it grow. 
1CO.3.7	It’s not important who does the planting, or who does the watering. What’s important is that God makes the seed grow. 
1CO.3.8	The one who plants and the one who waters work together with the same purpose. And both will be rewarded for their own hard work. 
1CO.3.9	For we are both God’s workers. And you are God’s field. You are God’s building.
1CO.3.10	Because of God’s grace to me, I have laid the foundation like an expert builder. Now others are building on it. But whoever is building on this foundation must be very careful. 
1CO.3.11	For no one can lay any foundation other than the one we already have—Jesus Christ.
1CO.3.12	Anyone who builds on that foundation may use a variety of materials—gold, silver, jewels, wood, hay, or straw. 
1CO.3.13	But on the judgment day, fire will reveal what kind of work each builder has done. The fire will show if a person’s work has any value. 
1CO.3.14	If the work survives, that builder will receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	But if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss. The builder will be saved, but like someone barely escaping through a wall of flames.
1CO.3.16	Don’t you realize that all of you together are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God lives in
1CO.3.17	God will destroy anyone who destroys this temple. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.
1CO.3.18	Stop deceiving yourselves. If you think you are wise by this world’s standards, you need to become a fool to be truly wise. 
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. As the Scriptures say,
1CO.3.19	“He traps the wise
1CO.3.19	in the snare of their own cleverness.”
1CO.3.20	And again,
1CO.3.20	“The 
1CO.3.20	he knows they are worthless.”
1CO.3.21	So don’t boast about following a particular human leader. For everything belongs to you—
1CO.3.22	whether Paul or Apollos or Peter,
1CO.3.23	and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
1CO.4.1	So look at Apollos and me as mere servants of Christ who have been put in charge of explaining God’s mysteries. 
1CO.4.2	Now, a person who is put in charge as a manager must be faithful. 
1CO.4.3	As for me, it matters very little how I might be evaluated by you or by any human authority. I don’t even trust my own judgment on this point. 
1CO.4.4	My conscience is clear, but that doesn’t prove I’m right. It is the Lord himself who will examine me and decide.
1CO.4.5	So don’t make judgments about anyone ahead of time—before the Lord returns. For he will bring our darkest secrets to light and will reveal our private motives. Then God will give to each one whatever praise is due.
1CO.4.6	Dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.4.7	For what gives you the right to make such a judgment? What do you have that God hasn’t given you? And if everything you have is from God, why boast as though it were not a gift?
1CO.4.8	You think you already have everything you need. You think you are already rich. You have begun to reign in God’s kingdom without us! I wish you really were reigning already, for then we would be reigning with you. 
1CO.4.9	Instead, I sometimes think God has put us apostles on display, like prisoners of war at the end of a victor’s parade, condemned to die. We have become a spectacle to the entire world—to people and angels alike.
1CO.4.10	Our dedication to Christ makes us look like fools, but you claim to be so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are so powerful! You are honored, but we are ridiculed. 
1CO.4.11	Even now we go hungry and thirsty, and we don’t have enough clothes to keep warm. We are often beaten and have no home. 
1CO.4.12	We work wearily with our own hands to earn our living. We bless those who curse us. We are patient with those who abuse us. 
1CO.4.13	We appeal gently when evil things are said about us. Yet we are treated like the world’s garbage, like everybody’s trash—right up to the present moment.
1CO.4.14	I am not writing these things to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children. 
1CO.4.15	For even if you had ten thousand others to teach you about Christ, you have only one spiritual father. For I became your father in Christ Jesus when I preached the Good News to you. 
1CO.4.16	So I urge you to imitate me.
1CO.4.17	That’s why I have sent Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of how I follow Christ Jesus, just as I teach in all the churches wherever I go.
1CO.4.18	Some of you have become arrogant, thinking I will not visit you again. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come—and soon—if the Lord lets me, and then I’ll find out whether these arrogant people just give pretentious speeches or whether they really have God’s power. 
1CO.4.20	For the Kingdom of God is not just a lot of talk; it is living by God’s power. 
1CO.4.21	Which do you choose? Should I come with a rod to punish you, or should I come with love and a gentle spirit?
1CO.5.1	I can hardly believe the report about the sexual immorality going on among you—something that even pagans don’t do. I am told that a man in your church is living in sin with his stepmother.
1CO.5.2	You are so proud of yourselves, but you should be mourning in sorrow and shame. And you should remove this man from your fellowship.
1CO.5.3	Even though I am not with you in person, I am with you in the Spirit.
1CO.5.4	in the name of the Lord Jesus. You must call a meeting of the church.
1CO.5.5	Then you must throw this man out and hand him over to Satan so that his sinful nature will be destroyed
1CO.5.6	Your boasting about this is terrible. Don’t you realize that this sin is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough? 
1CO.5.7	Get rid of the old “yeast” by removing this wicked person from among you. Then you will be like a fresh batch of dough made without yeast, which is what you really are. Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us.
1CO.5.8	So let us celebrate the festival, not with the old bread
1CO.5.9	When I wrote to you before, I told you not to associate with people who indulge in sexual sin. 
1CO.5.10	But I wasn’t talking about unbelievers who indulge in sexual sin, or are greedy, or cheat people, or worship idols. You would have to leave this world to avoid people like that. 
1CO.5.11	I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer
1CO.5.12	It isn’t my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning. 
1CO.5.13	God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, “You must remove the evil person from among you.”
1CO.6.1	When one of you has a dispute with another believer, how dare you file a lawsuit and ask a secular court to decide the matter instead of taking it to other believers
1CO.6.2	Don’t you realize that someday we believers will judge the world? And since you are going to judge the world, can’t you decide even these little things among yourselves? 
1CO.6.3	Don’t you realize that we will judge angels? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life. 
1CO.6.4	If you have legal disputes about such matters, why go to outside judges who are not respected by the church? 
1CO.6.5	I am saying this to shame you. Isn’t there anyone in all the church who is wise enough to decide these issues? 
1CO.6.6	But instead, one believer
1CO.6.7	Even to have such lawsuits with one another is a defeat for you. Why not just accept the injustice and leave it at that? Why not let yourselves be cheated? 
1CO.6.8	Instead, you yourselves are the ones who do wrong and cheat even your fellow believers.
1CO.6.9	Don’t you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don’t fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, 
1CO.6.10	or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people—none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God. 
1CO.6.11	Some of you were once like that. But you were cleansed; you were made holy; you were made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.12	You say, “I am allowed to do anything”—but not everything is good for you. And even though “I am allowed to do anything,” I must not become a slave to anything. 
1CO.6.13	You say, “Food was made for the stomach, and the stomach for food.” (This is true, though someday God will do away with both of them.) But you can’t say that our bodies were made for sexual immorality. They were made for the Lord, and the Lord cares about our bodies. 
1CO.6.14	And God will raise us from the dead by his power, just as he raised our Lord from the dead.
1CO.6.15	Don’t you realize that your bodies are actually parts of Christ? Should a man take his body, which is part of Christ, and join it to a prostitute? Never! 
1CO.6.16	And don’t you realize that if a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her? For the Scriptures say, “The two are united into one.”
1CO.6.17	But the person who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him.
1CO.6.18	Run from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body. 
1CO.6.19	Don’t you realize that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself, 
1CO.6.20	for God bought you with a high price. So you must honor God with your body.
1CO.7.1	Now regarding the questions you asked in your letter. Yes, it is good to abstain from sexual relations.
1CO.7.2	But because there is so much sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.
1CO.7.3	The husband should fulfill his wife’s sexual needs, and the wife should fulfill her husband’s needs. 
1CO.7.4	The wife gives authority over her body to her husband, and the husband gives authority over his body to his wife.
1CO.7.5	Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won’t be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 
1CO.7.6	I say this as a concession, not as a command. 
1CO.7.7	But I wish everyone were single, just as I am. Yet each person has a special gift from God, of one kind or another.
1CO.7.8	So I say to those who aren’t married and to widows—it’s better to stay unmarried, just as I am. 
1CO.7.9	But if they can’t control themselves, they should go ahead and marry. It’s better to marry than to burn with lust.
1CO.7.10	But for those who are married, I have a command that comes not from me, but from the Lord.
1CO.7.11	But if she does leave him, let her remain single or else be reconciled to him. And the husband must not leave his wife.
1CO.7.12	Now, I will speak to the rest of you, though I do not have a direct command from the Lord. If a fellow believer
1CO.7.13	And if a believing woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to continue living with her, she must not leave him. 
1CO.7.14	For the believing wife brings holiness to her marriage, and the believing husband
1CO.7.15	(But if the husband or wife who isn’t a believer insists on leaving, let them go. In such cases the believing husband or wife
1CO.7.16	Don’t you wives realize that your husbands might be saved because of you? And don’t you husbands realize that your wives might be saved because of you?
1CO.7.17	Each of you should continue to live in whatever situation the Lord has placed you, and remain as you were when God first called you. This is my rule for all the churches. 
1CO.7.18	For instance, a man who was circumcised before he became a believer should not try to reverse it. And the man who was uncircumcised when he became a believer should not be circumcised now. 
1CO.7.19	For it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised. The important thing is to keep God’s commandments.
1CO.7.20	Yes, each of you should remain as you were when God called you. 
1CO.7.21	Are you a slave? Don’t let that worry you—but if you get a chance to be free, take it. 
1CO.7.22	And remember, if you were a slave when the Lord called you, you are now free in the Lord. And if you were free when the Lord called you, you are now a slave of Christ. 
1CO.7.23	God paid a high price for you, so don’t be enslaved by the world.
1CO.7.24	Each of you, dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.7.25	Now regarding your question about the young women who are not yet married. I do not have a command from the Lord for them. But the Lord in his mercy has given me wisdom that can be trusted, and I will share it with you. 
1CO.7.26	Because of the present crisis,
1CO.7.27	If you have a wife, do not seek to end the marriage. If you do not have a wife, do not seek to get married. 
1CO.7.28	But if you do get married, it is not a sin. And if a young woman gets married, it is not a sin. However, those who get married at this time will have troubles, and I am trying to spare you those problems.
1CO.7.29	But let me say this, dear brothers and sisters: The time that remains is very short. So from now on, those with wives should not focus only on their marriage. 
1CO.7.30	Those who weep or who rejoice or who buy things should not be absorbed by their weeping or their joy or their possessions. 
1CO.7.31	Those who use the things of the world should not become attached to them. For this world as we know it will soon pass away.
1CO.7.32	I want you to be free from the concerns of this life. An unmarried man can spend his time doing the Lord’s work and thinking how to please him. 
1CO.7.33	But a married man has to think about his earthly responsibilities and how to please his wife. 
1CO.7.34	His interests are divided. In the same way, a woman who is no longer married or has never been married can be devoted to the Lord and holy in body and in spirit. But a married woman has to think about her earthly responsibilities and how to please her husband. 
1CO.7.35	I am saying this for your benefit, not to place restrictions on you. I want you to do whatever will help you serve the Lord best, with as few distractions as possible.
1CO.7.36	But if a man thinks that he’s treating his fiancée improperly and will inevitably give in to his passion, let him marry her as he wishes. It is not a sin. 
1CO.7.37	But if he has decided firmly not to marry and there is no urgency and he can control his passion, he does well not to marry. 
1CO.7.38	So the person who marries his fiancée does well, and the person who doesn’t marry does even better.
1CO.7.39	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but only if he loves the Lord.
1CO.7.40	But in my opinion it would be better for her to stay single, and I think I am giving you counsel from God’s Spirit when I say this.
1CO.8.1	Now regarding your question about food that has been offered to idols. Yes, we know that “we all have knowledge” about this issue. But while knowledge makes us feel important, it is love that strengthens the church. 
1CO.8.2	Anyone who claims to know all the answers doesn’t really know very much. 
1CO.8.3	But the person who loves God is the one whom God recognizes.
1CO.8.4	So, what about eating meat that has been offered to idols? Well, we all know that an idol is not really a god and that there is only one God. 
1CO.8.5	There may be so-called gods both in heaven and on earth, and some people actually worship many gods and many lords. 
1CO.8.6	But for us,
1CO.8.6	There is one God, the Father,
1CO.8.6	by whom all things were created,
1CO.8.6	and for whom we live.
1CO.8.6	And there is one Lord, Jesus Christ,
1CO.8.6	through whom all things were created,
1CO.8.6	and through whom we live.
1CO.8.7	However, not all believers know this. Some are accustomed to thinking of idols as being real, so when they eat food that has been offered to idols, they think of it as the worship of real gods, and their weak consciences are violated. 
1CO.8.8	It’s true that we can’t win God’s approval by what we eat. We don’t lose anything if we don’t eat it, and we don’t gain anything if we do.
1CO.8.9	But you must be careful so that your freedom does not cause others with a weaker conscience to stumble. 
1CO.8.10	For if others see you—with your “superior knowledge”—eating in the temple of an idol, won’t they be encouraged to violate their conscience by eating food that has been offered to an idol? 
1CO.8.11	So because of your superior knowledge, a weak believer
1CO.8.12	And when you sin against other believers
1CO.8.13	So if what I eat causes another believer to sin, I will never eat meat again as long as I live—for I don’t want to cause another believer to stumble.
1CO.9.1	Am I not as free as anyone else? Am I not an apostle? Haven’t I seen Jesus our Lord with my own eyes? Isn’t it because of my work that you belong to the Lord? 
1CO.9.2	Even if others think I am not an apostle, I certainly am to you. You yourselves are proof that I am the Lord’s apostle.
1CO.9.3	This is my answer to those who question my authority.
1CO.9.4	Don’t we have the right to live in your homes and share your meals? 
1CO.9.5	Don’t we have the right to bring a believing wife
1CO.9.6	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have to work to support ourselves?
1CO.9.7	What soldier has to pay his own expenses? What farmer plants a vineyard and doesn’t have the right to eat some of its fruit? What shepherd cares for a flock of sheep and isn’t allowed to drink some of the milk? 
1CO.9.8	Am I expressing merely a human opinion, or does the law say the same thing? 
1CO.9.9	For the law of Moses says, “You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain.”
1CO.9.10	Wasn’t he actually speaking to us? Yes, it was written for us, so that the one who plows and the one who threshes the grain might both expect a share of the harvest.
1CO.9.11	Since we have planted spiritual seed among you, aren’t we entitled to a harvest of physical food and drink? 
1CO.9.12	If you support others who preach to you, shouldn’t we have an even greater right to be supported? But we have never used this right. We would rather put up with anything than be an obstacle to the Good News about Christ.
1CO.9.13	Don’t you realize that those who work in the temple get their meals from the offerings brought to the temple? And those who serve at the altar get a share of the sacrificial offerings. 
1CO.9.14	In the same way, the Lord ordered that those who preach the Good News should be supported by those who benefit from it. 
1CO.9.15	Yet I have never used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to suggest that I want to start now. In fact, I would rather die than lose my right to boast about preaching without charge. 
1CO.9.16	Yet preaching the Good News is not something I can boast about. I am compelled by God to do it. How terrible for me if I didn’t preach the Good News!
1CO.9.17	If I were doing this on my own initiative, I would deserve payment. But I have no choice, for God has given me this sacred trust. 
1CO.9.18	What then is my pay? It is the opportunity to preach the Good News without charging anyone. That’s why I never demand my rights when I preach the Good News.
1CO.9.19	Even though I am a free man with no master, I have become a slave to all people to bring many to Christ. 
1CO.9.20	When I was with the Jews, I lived like a Jew to bring the Jews to Christ. When I was with those who follow the Jewish law, I too lived under that law. Even though I am not subject to the law, I did this so I could bring to Christ those who are under the law. 
1CO.9.21	When I am with the Gentiles who do not follow the Jewish law,
1CO.9.22	When I am with those who are weak, I share their weakness, for I want to bring the weak to Christ. Yes, I try to find common ground with everyone, doing everything I can to save some. 
1CO.9.23	I do everything to spread the Good News and share in its blessings.
1CO.9.24	Don’t you realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run to win! 
1CO.9.25	All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize. 
1CO.9.26	So I run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing. 
1CO.9.27	I discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.
1CO.10.1	I don’t want you to forget, dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.10.2	In the cloud and in the sea, all of them were baptized as followers of Moses. 
1CO.10.3	All of them ate the same spiritual food, 
1CO.10.4	and all of them drank the same spiritual water. For they drank from the spiritual rock that traveled with them, and that rock was Christ. 
1CO.10.5	Yet God was not pleased with most of them, and their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.
1CO.10.6	These things happened as a warning to us, so that we would not crave evil things as they did, 
1CO.10.7	or worship idols as some of them did. As the Scriptures say, “The people celebrated with feasting and drinking, and they indulged in pagan revelry.”
1CO.10.8	And we must not engage in sexual immorality as some of them did, causing 23,000 of them to die in one day.
1CO.10.9	Nor should we put Christ
1CO.10.10	And don’t grumble as some of them did, and then were destroyed by the angel of death. 
1CO.10.11	These things happened to them as examples for us. They were written down to warn us who live at the end of the age.
1CO.10.12	If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall. 
1CO.10.13	The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure.
1CO.10.14	So, my dear friends, flee from the worship of idols. 
1CO.10.15	You are reasonable people. Decide for yourselves if what I am saying is true. 
1CO.10.16	When we bless the cup at the Lord’s Table, aren’t we sharing in the blood of Christ? And when we break the bread, aren’t we sharing in the body of Christ? 
1CO.10.17	And though we are many, we all eat from one loaf of bread, showing that we are one body. 
1CO.10.18	Think about the people of Israel. Weren’t they united by eating the sacrifices at the altar?
1CO.10.19	What am I trying to say? Am I saying that food offered to idols has some significance, or that idols are real gods? 
1CO.10.20	No, not at all. I am saying that these sacrifices are offered to demons, not to God. And I don’t want you to participate with demons. 
1CO.10.21	You cannot drink from the cup of the Lord and from the cup of demons, too. You cannot eat at the Lord’s Table and at the table of demons, too. 
1CO.10.22	What? Do we dare to rouse the Lord’s jealousy? Do you think we are stronger than he is?
1CO.10.23	You say, “I am allowed to do anything”
1CO.10.24	Don’t be concerned for your own good but for the good of others.
1CO.10.25	So you may eat any meat that is sold in the marketplace without raising questions of conscience. 
1CO.10.26	For “the earth is the 
1CO.10.27	If someone who isn’t a believer asks you home for dinner, accept the invitation if you want to. Eat whatever is offered to you without raising questions of conscience. 
1CO.10.28	(But suppose someone tells you, “This meat was offered to an idol.” Don’t eat it, out of consideration for the conscience of the one who told you. 
1CO.10.29	It might not be a matter of conscience for you, but it is for the other person.) For why should my freedom be limited by what someone else thinks? 
1CO.10.30	If I can thank God for the food and enjoy it, why should I be condemned for eating it?
1CO.10.31	So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	Don’t give offense to Jews or Gentiles
1CO.10.33	I, too, try to please everyone in everything I do. I don’t just do what is best for me; I do what is best for others so that many may be saved. 
1CO.10.34	And you should imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.
1CO.11.2	I am so glad that you always keep me in your thoughts, and that you are following the teachings I passed on to you. 
1CO.11.3	But there is one thing I want you to know: The head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.
1CO.11.4	A man dishonors his head
1CO.11.5	But a woman dishonors her head
1CO.11.6	Yes, if she refuses to wear a head covering, she should cut off all her hair! But since it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or her head shaved, she should wear a covering.
1CO.11.7	A man should not wear anything on his head when worshiping, for man is made in God’s image and reflects God’s glory. And woman reflects man’s glory. 
1CO.11.8	For the first man didn’t come from woman, but the first woman came from man. 
1CO.11.9	And man was not made for woman, but woman was made for man. 
1CO.11.10	For this reason, and because the angels are watching, a woman should wear a covering on her head to show she is under authority.
1CO.11.11	But among the Lord’s people, women are not independent of men, and men are not independent of women. 
1CO.11.12	For although the first woman came from man, every other man was born from a woman, and everything comes from God.
1CO.11.13	Judge for yourselves. Is it right for a woman to pray to God in public without covering her head? 
1CO.11.14	Isn’t it obvious that it’s disgraceful for a man to have long hair? 
1CO.11.15	And isn’t long hair a woman’s pride and joy? For it has been given to her as a covering. 
1CO.11.16	But if anyone wants to argue about this, I simply say that we have no other custom than this, and neither do God’s other churches.
1CO.11.17	But in the following instructions, I cannot praise you. For it sounds as if more harm than good is done when you meet together. 
1CO.11.18	First, I hear that there are divisions among you when you meet as a church, and to some extent I believe it. 
1CO.11.19	But, of course, there must be divisions among you so that you who have God’s approval will be recognized!
1CO.11.20	When you meet together, you are not really interested in the Lord’s Supper. 
1CO.11.21	For some of you hurry to eat your own meal without sharing with others. As a result, some go hungry while others get drunk. 
1CO.11.22	What? Don’t you have your own homes for eating and drinking? Or do you really want to disgrace God’s church and shame the poor? What am I supposed to say? Do you want me to praise you? Well, I certainly will not praise you for this!
1CO.11.23	For I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread 
1CO.11.24	and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and said, 
1CO.11.25	In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper, saying, 
1CO.11.26	For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are announcing the Lord’s death until he comes again.
1CO.11.27	So anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is guilty of sinning against
1CO.11.28	That is why you should examine yourself before eating the bread and drinking the cup. 
1CO.11.29	For if you eat the bread or drink the cup without honoring the body of Christ,
1CO.11.30	That is why many of you are weak and sick and some have even died.
1CO.11.31	But if we would examine ourselves, we would not be judged by God in this way. 
1CO.11.32	Yet when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned along with the world.
1CO.11.33	So, my dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.11.34	If you are really hungry, eat at home so you won’t bring judgment upon yourselves when you meet together. I’ll give you instructions about the other matters after I arrive.
1CO.12.1	Now, dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.12.2	You know that when you were still pagans, you were led astray and swept along in worshiping speechless idols. 
1CO.12.3	So I want you to know that no one speaking by the Spirit of God will curse Jesus, and no one can say Jesus is Lord, except by the Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.4	There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit is the source of them all. 
1CO.12.5	There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord. 
1CO.12.6	God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of us.
1CO.12.7	A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other. 
1CO.12.8	To one person the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice
1CO.12.9	The same Spirit gives great faith to another, and to someone else the one Spirit gives the gift of healing. 
1CO.12.10	He gives one person the power to perform miracles, and another the ability to prophesy. He gives someone else the ability to discern whether a message is from the Spirit of God or from another spirit. Still another person is given the ability to speak in unknown languages,
1CO.12.11	It is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts. He alone decides which gift each person should have.
1CO.12.12	The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up one whole body. So it is with the body of Christ. 
1CO.12.13	Some of us are Jews, some are Gentiles,
1CO.12.14	Yes, the body has many different parts, not just one part. 
1CO.12.15	If the foot says, “I am not a part of the body because I am not a hand,” that does not make it any less a part of the body. 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear says, “I am not part of the body because I am not an eye,” would that make it any less a part of the body? 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, how would you hear? Or if your whole body were an ear, how would you smell anything?
1CO.12.18	But our bodies have many parts, and God has put each part just where he wants it. 
1CO.12.19	How strange a body would be if it had only one part! 
1CO.12.20	Yes, there are many parts, but only one body. 
1CO.12.21	The eye can never say to the hand, “I don’t need you.” The head can’t say to the feet, “I don’t need you.”
1CO.12.22	In fact, some parts of the body that seem weakest and least important are actually the most necessary. 
1CO.12.23	And the parts we regard as less honorable are those we clothe with the greatest care. So we carefully protect those parts that should not be seen, 
1CO.12.24	while the more honorable parts do not require this special care. So God has put the body together such that extra honor and care are given to those parts that have less dignity. 
1CO.12.25	This makes for harmony among the members, so that all the members care for each other. 
1CO.12.26	If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it, and if one part is honored, all the parts are glad.
1CO.12.27	All of you together are Christ’s body, and each of you is a part of it. 
1CO.12.28	Here are some of the parts God has appointed for the church:
1CO.12.28	first are apostles,
1CO.12.28	second are prophets,
1CO.12.28	third are teachers,
1CO.12.28	then those who do miracles,
1CO.12.28	those who have the gift of healing,
1CO.12.28	those who can help others,
1CO.12.28	those who have the gift of leadership,
1CO.12.28	those who speak in unknown languages.
1CO.12.29	Are we all apostles? Are we all prophets? Are we all teachers? Do we all have the power to do miracles? 
1CO.12.30	Do we all have the gift of healing? Do we all have the ability to speak in unknown languages? Do we all have the ability to interpret unknown languages? Of course not! 
1CO.12.31	So you should earnestly desire the most helpful gifts.
1CO.12.31	But now let me show you a way of life that is best of all.
1CO.13.1	If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn’t love others, I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
1CO.13.2	If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God’s secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn’t love others, I would be nothing. 
1CO.13.3	If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it;
1CO.13.4	Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud 
1CO.13.5	or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. 
1CO.13.6	It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. 
1CO.13.7	Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.
1CO.13.8	Prophecy and speaking in unknown languages
1CO.13.9	Now our knowledge is partial and incomplete, and even the gift of prophecy reveals only part of the whole picture! 
1CO.13.10	But when the time of perfection comes, these partial things will become useless.
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things. 
1CO.13.12	Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity.
1CO.13.13	Three things will last forever—faith, hope, and love—and the greatest of these is love.
1CO.14.1	Let love be your highest goal! But you should also desire the special abilities the Spirit gives—especially the ability to prophesy. 
1CO.14.2	For if you have the ability to speak in tongues,
1CO.14.3	But one who prophesies strengthens others, encourages them, and comforts them. 
1CO.14.4	A person who speaks in tongues is strengthened personally, but one who speaks a word of prophecy strengthens the entire church.
1CO.14.5	I wish you could all speak in tongues, but even more I wish you could all prophesy. For prophecy is greater than speaking in tongues, unless someone interprets what you are saying so that the whole church will be strengthened.
1CO.14.6	Dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.14.7	Even lifeless instruments like the flute or the harp must play the notes clearly, or no one will recognize the melody. 
1CO.14.8	And if the bugler doesn’t sound a clear call, how will the soldiers know they are being called to battle?
1CO.14.9	It’s the same for you. If you speak to people in words they don’t understand, how will they know what you are saying? You might as well be talking into empty space.
1CO.14.10	There are many different languages in the world, and every language has meaning. 
1CO.14.11	But if I don’t understand a language, I will be a foreigner to someone who speaks it, and the one who speaks it will be a foreigner to me. 
1CO.14.12	And the same is true for you. Since you are so eager to have the special abilities the Spirit gives, seek those that will strengthen the whole church.
1CO.14.13	So anyone who speaks in tongues should pray also for the ability to interpret what has been said. 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in tongues, my spirit is praying, but I don’t understand what I am saying.
1CO.14.15	Well then, what shall I do? I will pray in the spirit,
1CO.14.16	For if you praise God only in the spirit, how can those who don’t understand you praise God along with you? How can they join you in giving thanks when they don’t understand what you are saying? 
1CO.14.17	You will be giving thanks very well, but it won’t strengthen the people who hear you.
1CO.14.18	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you. 
1CO.14.19	But in a church meeting I would rather speak five understandable words to help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language.
1CO.14.20	Dear brothers and sisters, don’t be childish in your understanding of these things. Be innocent as babies when it comes to evil, but be mature in understanding matters of this kind. 
1CO.14.21	It is written in the Scriptures
1CO.14.21	“I will speak to my own people
1CO.14.21	through strange languages
1CO.14.21	and through the lips of foreigners.
1CO.14.21	But even then, they will not listen to me,”
1CO.14.21	says the 
1CO.14.22	So you see that speaking in tongues is a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is for the benefit of believers, not unbelievers. 
1CO.14.23	Even so, if unbelievers or people who don’t understand these things come into your church meeting and hear everyone speaking in an unknown language, they will think you are crazy. 
1CO.14.24	But if all of you are prophesying, and unbelievers or people who don’t understand these things come into your meeting, they will be convicted of sin and judged by what you say. 
1CO.14.25	As they listen, their secret thoughts will be exposed, and they will fall to their knees and worship God, declaring, “God is truly here among you.”
1CO.14.26	Well, my brothers and sisters, let’s summarize. When you meet together, one will sing, another will teach, another will tell some special revelation God has given, one will speak in tongues, and another will interpret what is said. But everything that is done must strengthen all of you.
1CO.14.27	No more than two or three should speak in tongues. They must speak one at a time, and someone must interpret what they say. 
1CO.14.28	But if no one is present who can interpret, they must be silent in your church meeting and speak in tongues to God privately.
1CO.14.29	Let two or three people prophesy, and let the others evaluate what is said. 
1CO.14.30	But if someone is prophesying and another person receives a revelation from the Lord, the one who is speaking must stop. 
1CO.14.31	In this way, all who prophesy will have a turn to speak, one after the other, so that everyone will learn and be encouraged. 
1CO.14.32	Remember that people who prophesy are in control of their spirit and can take turns. 
1CO.14.33	For God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the meetings of God’s holy people.
1CO.14.34	Women should be silent during the church meetings. It is not proper for them to speak. They should be submissive, just as the law says. 
1CO.14.35	If they have any questions, they should ask their husbands at home, for it is improper for women to speak in church meetings.
1CO.14.36	Or do you think God’s word originated with you Corinthians? Are you the only ones to whom it was given? 
1CO.14.37	If you claim to be a prophet or think you are spiritual, you should recognize that what I am saying is a command from the Lord himself. 
1CO.14.38	But if you do not recognize this, you yourself will not be recognized.
1CO.14.39	So, my dear brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and don’t forbid speaking in tongues. 
1CO.14.40	But be sure that everything is done properly and in order.
1CO.15.1	Let me now remind you, dear brothers and sisters,
1CO.15.2	It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you—unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place.
1CO.15.3	I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. 
1CO.15.4	He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. 
1CO.15.5	He was seen by Peter
1CO.15.6	After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers
1CO.15.7	Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles. 
1CO.15.8	Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw him. 
1CO.15.9	For I am the least of all the apostles. In fact, I’m not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted God’s church.
1CO.15.10	But whatever I am now, it is all because God poured out his special favor on me—and not without results. For I have worked harder than any of the other apostles; yet it was not I but God who was working through me by his grace. 
1CO.15.11	So it makes no difference whether I preach or they preach, for we all preach the same message you have already believed.
1CO.15.12	But tell me this—since we preach that Christ rose from the dead, why are some of you saying there will be no resurrection of the dead? 
1CO.15.13	For if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised either. 
1CO.15.14	And if Christ has not been raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your faith is useless. 
1CO.15.15	And we apostles would all be lying about God—for we have said that God raised Christ from the grave. But that can’t be true if there is no resurrection of the dead. 
1CO.15.16	And if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised. 
1CO.15.17	And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is useless and you are still guilty of your sins. 
1CO.15.18	In that case, all who have died believing in Christ are lost! 
1CO.15.19	And if our hope in Christ is only for this life, we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world.
1CO.15.20	But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead. He is the first of a great harvest of all who have died.
1CO.15.21	So you see, just as death came into the world through a man, now the resurrection from the dead has begun through another man. 
1CO.15.22	Just as everyone dies because we all belong to Adam, everyone who belongs to Christ will be given new life. 
1CO.15.23	But there is an order to this resurrection: Christ was raised as the first of the harvest; then all who belong to Christ will be raised when he comes back.
1CO.15.24	After that the end will come, when he will turn the Kingdom over to God the Father, having destroyed every ruler and authority and power. 
1CO.15.25	For Christ must reign until he humbles all his enemies beneath his feet. 
1CO.15.26	And the last enemy to be destroyed is death. 
1CO.15.27	For the Scriptures say, “God has put all things under his authority.”
1CO.15.28	Then, when all things are under his authority, the Son will put himself under God’s authority, so that God, who gave his Son authority over all things, will be utterly supreme over everything everywhere.
1CO.15.29	If the dead will not be raised, what point is there in people being baptized for those who are dead? Why do it unless the dead will someday rise again?
1CO.15.30	And why should we ourselves risk our lives hour by hour? 
1CO.15.31	For I swear, dear brothers and sisters, that I face death daily. This is as certain as my pride in what Christ Jesus our Lord has done in you. 
1CO.15.32	And what value was there in fighting wild beasts—those people of Ephesus
1CO.15.33	Don’t be fooled by those who say such things, for “bad company corrupts good character.” 
1CO.15.34	Think carefully about what is right, and stop sinning. For to your shame I say that some of you don’t know God at all.
1CO.15.35	But someone may ask, “How will the dead be raised? What kind of bodies will they have?” 
1CO.15.36	What a foolish question! When you put a seed into the ground, it doesn’t grow into a plant unless it dies first. 
1CO.15.37	And what you put in the ground is not the plant that will grow, but only a bare seed of wheat or whatever you are planting. 
1CO.15.38	Then God gives it the new body he wants it to have. A different plant grows from each kind of seed. 
1CO.15.39	Similarly there are different kinds of flesh—one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
1CO.15.40	There are also bodies in the heavens and bodies on the earth. The glory of the heavenly bodies is different from the glory of the earthly bodies. 
1CO.15.41	The sun has one kind of glory, while the moon and stars each have another kind. And even the stars differ from each other in their glory.
1CO.15.42	It is the same way with the resurrection of the dead. Our earthly bodies are planted in the ground when we die, but they will be raised to live forever. 
1CO.15.43	Our bodies are buried in brokenness, but they will be raised in glory. They are buried in weakness, but they will be raised in strength. 
1CO.15.44	They are buried as natural human bodies, but they will be raised as spiritual bodies. For just as there are natural bodies, there are also spiritual bodies.
1CO.15.45	The Scriptures tell us, “The first man, Adam, became a living person.”
1CO.15.46	What comes first is the natural body, then the spiritual body comes later. 
1CO.15.47	Adam, the first man, was made from the dust of the earth, while Christ, the second man, came from heaven. 
1CO.15.48	Earthly people are like the earthly man, and heavenly people are like the heavenly man. 
1CO.15.49	Just as we are now like the earthly man, we will someday be like
1CO.15.50	What I am saying, dear brothers and sisters, is that our physical bodies cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. These dying bodies cannot inherit what will last forever.
1CO.15.51	But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed! 
1CO.15.52	It will happen in a moment, in the blink of an eye, when the last trumpet is blown. For when the trumpet sounds, those who have died will be raised to live forever. And we who are living will also be transformed. 
1CO.15.53	For our dying bodies must be transformed into bodies that will never die; our mortal bodies must be transformed into immortal bodies.
1CO.15.54	Then, when our dying bodies have been transformed into bodies that will never die,
1CO.15.54	“Death is swallowed up in victory.
1CO.15.55	O death, where is your victory?
1CO.15.55	O death, where is your sting?
1CO.15.56	For sin is the sting that results in death, and the law gives sin its power. 
1CO.15.57	But thank God! He gives us victory over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.15.58	So, my dear brothers and sisters, be strong and immovable. Always work enthusiastically for the Lord, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless.
1CO.16.1	Now regarding your question about the money being collected for God’s people in Jerusalem. You should follow the same procedure I gave to the churches in Galatia. 
1CO.16.2	On the first day of each week, you should each put aside a portion of the money you have earned. Don’t wait until I get there and then try to collect it all at once. 
1CO.16.3	When I come, I will write letters of recommendation for the messengers you choose to deliver your gift to Jerusalem. 
1CO.16.4	And if it seems appropriate for me to go along, they can travel with me.
1CO.16.5	I am coming to visit you after I have been to Macedonia,
1CO.16.6	Perhaps I will stay awhile with you, possibly all winter, and then you can send me on my way to my next destination. 
1CO.16.7	This time I don’t want to make just a short visit and then go right on. I want to come and stay awhile, if the Lord will let me. 
1CO.16.8	In the meantime, I will be staying here at Ephesus until the Festival of Pentecost. 
1CO.16.9	There is a wide-open door for a great work here, although many oppose me.
1CO.16.10	When Timothy comes, don’t intimidate him. He is doing the Lord’s work, just as I am. 
1CO.16.11	Don’t let anyone treat him with contempt. Send him on his way with your blessing when he returns to me. I expect him to come with the other believers.
1CO.16.12	Now about our brother Apollos—I urged him to visit you with the other believers, but he was not willing to go right now. He will see you later when he has the opportunity.
1CO.16.13	Be on guard. Stand firm in the faith. Be courageous.
1CO.16.14	And do everything with love.
1CO.16.15	You know that Stephanas and his household were the first of the harvest of believers in Greece,
1CO.16.16	to submit to them and others like them who serve with such devotion. 
1CO.16.17	I am very glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have come here. They have been providing the help you weren’t here to give me. 
1CO.16.18	They have been a wonderful encouragement to me, as they have been to you. You must show your appreciation to all who serve so well.
1CO.16.19	The churches here in the province of Asia
1CO.16.20	All the brothers and sisters here send greetings to you. Greet each other with a sacred kiss.
1CO.16.21	.
1CO.16.22	If anyone does not love the Lord, that person is cursed. Our Lord, come!
1CO.16.23	May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
1CO.16.24	My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.
2CO.1.1	This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy.
2CO.1.1	I am writing to God’s church in Corinth and to all of his holy people throughout Greece.
2CO.1.2	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
2CO.1.3	All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is our merciful Father and the source of all comfort. 
2CO.1.4	He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others. When they are troubled, we will be able to give them the same comfort God has given us. 
2CO.1.5	For the more we suffer for Christ, the more God will shower us with his comfort through Christ. 
2CO.1.6	Even when we are weighed down with troubles, it is for your comfort and salvation! For when we ourselves are comforted, we will certainly comfort you. Then you can patiently endure the same things we suffer. 
2CO.1.7	We are confident that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in the comfort God gives us.
2CO.1.8	We think you ought to know, dear brothers and sisters,
2CO.1.9	In fact, we expected to die. But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God, who raises the dead. 
2CO.1.10	And he did rescue us from mortal danger, and he will rescue us again. We have placed our confidence in him, and he will continue to rescue us. 
2CO.1.11	And you are helping us by praying for us. Then many people will give thanks because God has graciously answered so many prayers for our safety.
2CO.1.12	We can say with confidence and a clear conscience that we have lived with a God-given holiness
2CO.1.13	Our letters have been straightforward, and there is nothing written between the lines and nothing you can’t understand. I hope someday you will fully understand us, 
2CO.1.14	even if you don’t understand us now. Then on the day when the Lord Jesus
2CO.1.15	Since I was so sure of your understanding and trust, I wanted to give you a double blessing by visiting you twice—
2CO.1.16	first on my way to Macedonia and again when I returned from Macedonia.
2CO.1.17	You may be asking why I changed my plan. Do you think I make my plans carelessly? Do you think I am like people of the world who say “Yes” when they really mean “No”? 
2CO.1.18	As surely as God is faithful, our word to you does not waver between “Yes” and “No.” 
2CO.1.19	For Jesus Christ, the Son of God, does not waver between “Yes” and “No.” He is the one whom Silas,
2CO.1.20	For all of God’s promises have been fulfilled in Christ with a resounding “Yes!” And through Christ, our “Amen” (which means “Yes”) ascends to God for his glory.
2CO.1.21	It is God who enables us, along with you, to stand firm for Christ. He has commissioned us, 
2CO.1.22	and he has identified us as his own by placing the Holy Spirit in our hearts as the first installment that guarantees everything he has promised us.
2CO.1.23	Now I call upon God as my witness that I am telling the truth. The reason I didn’t return to Corinth was to spare you from a severe rebuke. 
2CO.1.24	But that does not mean we want to dominate you by telling you how to put your faith into practice. We want to work together with you so you will be full of joy, for it is by your own faith that you stand firm.
2CO.2.1	So I decided that I would not bring you grief with another painful visit. 
2CO.2.2	For if I cause you grief, who will make me glad? Certainly not someone I have grieved. 
2CO.2.3	That is why I wrote to you as I did, so that when I do come, I won’t be grieved by the very ones who ought to give me the greatest joy. Surely you all know that my joy comes from your being joyful. 
2CO.2.4	I wrote that letter in great anguish, with a troubled heart and many tears. I didn’t want to grieve you, but I wanted to let you know how much love I have for you.
2CO.2.5	I am not overstating it when I say that the man who caused all the trouble hurt all of you more than he hurt me. 
2CO.2.6	Most of you opposed him, and that was punishment enough. 
2CO.2.7	Now, however, it is time to forgive and comfort him. Otherwise he may be overcome by discouragement. 
2CO.2.8	So I urge you now to reaffirm your love for him.
2CO.2.9	I wrote to you as I did to test you and see if you would fully comply with my instructions. 
2CO.2.10	When you forgive this man, I forgive him, too. And when I forgive whatever needs to be forgiven, I do so with Christ’s authority for your benefit, 
2CO.2.11	so that Satan will not outsmart us. For we are familiar with his evil schemes.
2CO.2.12	When I came to the city of Troas to preach the Good News of Christ, the Lord opened a door of opportunity for me. 
2CO.2.13	But I had no peace of mind because my dear brother Titus hadn’t yet arrived with a report from you. So I said good-bye and went on to Macedonia to find him.
2CO.2.14	But thank God! He has made us his captives and continues to lead us along in Christ’s triumphal procession. Now he uses us to spread the knowledge of Christ everywhere, like a sweet perfume. 
2CO.2.15	Our lives are a Christ-like fragrance rising up to God. But this fragrance is perceived differently by those who are being saved and by those who are perishing. 
2CO.2.16	To those who are perishing, we are a dreadful smell of death and doom. But to those who are being saved, we are a life-giving perfume. And who is adequate for such a task as this?
2CO.2.17	You see, we are not like the many hucksters
2CO.3.1	Are we beginning to praise ourselves again? Are we like others, who need to bring you letters of recommendation, or who ask you to write such letters on their behalf? Surely not! 
2CO.3.2	The only letter of recommendation we need is you yourselves. Your lives are a letter written in our
2CO.3.3	Clearly, you are a letter from Christ showing the result of our ministry among you. This “letter” is written not with pen and ink, but with the Spirit of the living God. It is carved not on tablets of stone, but on human hearts.
2CO.3.4	We are confident of all this because of our great trust in God through Christ. 
2CO.3.5	It is not that we think we are qualified to do anything on our own. Our qualification comes from God. 
2CO.3.6	He has enabled us to be ministers of his new covenant. This is a covenant not of written laws, but of the Spirit. The old written covenant ends in death; but under the new covenant, the Spirit gives life.
2CO.3.7	The old way,
2CO.3.8	Shouldn’t we expect far greater glory under the new way, now that the Holy Spirit is giving life? 
2CO.3.9	If the old way, which brings condemnation, was glorious, how much more glorious is the new way, which makes us right with God! 
2CO.3.10	In fact, that first glory was not glorious at all compared with the overwhelming glory of the new way. 
2CO.3.11	So if the old way, which has been replaced, was glorious, how much more glorious is the new, which remains forever!
2CO.3.12	Since this new way gives us such confidence, we can be very bold. 
2CO.3.13	We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so the people of Israel would not see the glory, even though it was destined to fade away. 
2CO.3.14	But the people’s minds were hardened, and to this day whenever the old covenant is being read, the same veil covers their minds so they cannot understand the truth. And this veil can be removed only by believing in Christ. 
2CO.3.15	Yes, even today when they read Moses’ writings, their hearts are covered with that veil, and they do not understand.
2CO.3.16	But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 
2CO.3.17	For the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 
2CO.3.18	So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord. And the Lord—who is the Spirit—makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his glorious image.
2CO.4.1	Therefore, since God in his mercy has given us this new way,
2CO.4.2	We reject all shameful deeds and underhanded methods. We don’t try to trick anyone or distort the word of God. We tell the truth before God, and all who are honest know this.
2CO.4.3	If the Good News we preach is hidden behind a veil, it is hidden only from people who are perishing. 
2CO.4.4	Satan, who is the god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don’t believe. They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News. They don’t understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God.
2CO.4.5	You see, we don’t go around preaching about ourselves. We preach that Jesus Christ is Lord, and we ourselves are your servants for Jesus’ sake. 
2CO.4.6	For God, who said, “Let there be light in the darkness,” has made this light shine in our hearts so we could know the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ.
2CO.4.7	We now have this light shining in our hearts, but we ourselves are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure.
2CO.4.8	We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed. We are perplexed, but not driven to despair. 
2CO.4.9	We are hunted down, but never abandoned by God. We get knocked down, but we are not destroyed. 
2CO.4.10	Through suffering, our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies.
2CO.4.11	Yes, we live under constant danger of death because we serve Jesus, so that the life of Jesus will be evident in our dying bodies. 
2CO.4.12	So we live in the face of death, but this has resulted in eternal life for you.
2CO.4.13	But we continue to preach because we have the same kind of faith the psalmist had when he said, “I believed in God, so I spoke.”
2CO.4.14	We know that God, who raised the Lord Jesus,
2CO.4.15	All of this is for your benefit. And as God’s grace reaches more and more people, there will be great thanksgiving, and God will receive more and more glory.
2CO.4.16	That is why we never give up. Though our bodies are dying, our spirits are
2CO.4.17	For our present troubles are small and won’t last very long. Yet they produce for us a glory that vastly outweighs them and will last forever! 
2CO.4.18	So we don’t look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen. For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever.
2CO.5.1	For we know that when this earthly tent we live in is taken down (that is, when we die and leave this earthly body), we will have a house in heaven, an eternal body made for us by God himself and not by human hands. 
2CO.5.2	We grow weary in our present bodies, and we long to put on our heavenly bodies like new clothing. 
2CO.5.3	For we will put on heavenly bodies; we will not be spirits without bodies.
2CO.5.4	While we live in these earthly bodies, we groan and sigh, but it’s not that we want to die and get rid of these bodies that clothe us. Rather, we want to put on our new bodies so that these dying bodies will be swallowed up by life. 
2CO.5.5	God himself has prepared us for this, and as a guarantee he has given us his Holy Spirit.
2CO.5.6	So we are always confident, even though we know that as long as we live in these bodies we are not at home with the Lord. 
2CO.5.7	For we live by believing and not by seeing. 
2CO.5.8	Yes, we are fully confident, and we would rather be away from these earthly bodies, for then we will be at home with the Lord. 
2CO.5.9	So whether we are here in this body or away from this body, our goal is to please him. 
2CO.5.10	For we must all stand before Christ to be judged. We will each receive whatever we deserve for the good or evil we have done in this earthly body.
2CO.5.11	Because we understand our fearful responsibility to the Lord, we work hard to persuade others. God knows we are sincere, and I hope you know this, too. 
2CO.5.12	Are we commending ourselves to you again? No, we are giving you a reason to be proud of us,
2CO.5.13	If it seems we are crazy, it is to bring glory to God. And if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit. 
2CO.5.14	Either way, Christ’s love controls us.
2CO.5.15	He died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves. Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them.
2CO.5.16	So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now! 
2CO.5.17	This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!
2CO.5.18	And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him. 
2CO.5.19	For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people’s sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation. 
2CO.5.20	So we are Christ’s ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us. We speak for Christ when we plead, “Come back to God!” 
2CO.5.21	For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin,
2CO.6.1	As God’s partners,
2CO.6.2	For God says,
2CO.6.2	“At just the right time, I heard you.
2CO.6.2	On the day of salvation, I helped you.”
2CO.6.2	Indeed, the “right time” is now. Today is the day of salvation.
2CO.6.3	We live in such a way that no one will stumble because of us, and no one will find fault with our ministry. 
2CO.6.4	In everything we do, we show that we are true ministers of God. We patiently endure troubles and hardships and calamities of every kind. 
2CO.6.5	We have been beaten, been put in prison, faced angry mobs, worked to exhaustion, endured sleepless nights, and gone without food. 
2CO.6.6	We prove ourselves by our purity, our understanding, our patience, our kindness, by the Holy Spirit within us,
2CO.6.7	We faithfully preach the truth. God’s power is working in us. We use the weapons of righteousness in the right hand for attack and the left hand for defense. 
2CO.6.8	We serve God whether people honor us or despise us, whether they slander us or praise us. We are honest, but they call us impostors. 
2CO.6.9	We are ignored, even though we are well known. We live close to death, but we are still alive. We have been beaten, but we have not been killed. 
2CO.6.10	Our hearts ache, but we always have joy. We are poor, but we give spiritual riches to others. We own nothing, and yet we have everything.
2CO.6.11	Oh, dear Corinthian friends! We have spoken honestly with you, and our hearts are open to you. 
2CO.6.12	There is no lack of love on our part, but you have withheld your love from us. 
2CO.6.13	I am asking you to respond as if you were my own children. Open your hearts to us!
2CO.6.14	Don’t team up with those who are unbelievers. How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness? 
2CO.6.15	What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil
2CO.6.16	And what union can there be between God’s temple and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God said:
2CO.6.16	“I will live in them
2CO.6.16	and walk among them.
2CO.6.16	I will be their God,
2CO.6.16	and they will be my people.
2CO.6.17	Therefore, come out from among unbelievers,
2CO.6.17	and separate yourselves from them, says the 
2CO.6.17	Don’t touch their filthy things,
2CO.6.17	and I will welcome you.
2CO.6.18	And I will be your Father,
2CO.6.18	and you will be my sons and daughters,
2CO.6.18	says the 
2CO.7.1	Because we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that can defile our body or spirit. And let us work toward complete holiness because we fear God.
2CO.7.2	Please open your hearts to us. We have not done wrong to anyone, nor led anyone astray, nor taken advantage of anyone. 
2CO.7.3	I’m not saying this to condemn you. I said before that you are in our hearts, and we live or die together with you. 
2CO.7.4	I have the highest confidence in you, and I take great pride in you. You have greatly encouraged me and made me happy despite all our troubles.
2CO.7.5	When we arrived in Macedonia, there was no rest for us. We faced conflict from every direction, with battles on the outside and fear on the inside. 
2CO.7.6	But God, who encourages those who are discouraged, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus. 
2CO.7.7	His presence was a joy, but so was the news he brought of the encouragement he received from you. When he told us how much you long to see me, and how sorry you are for what happened, and how loyal you are to me, I was filled with joy!
2CO.7.8	I am not sorry that I sent that severe letter to you, though I was sorry at first, for I know it was painful to you for a little while. 
2CO.7.9	Now I am glad I sent it, not because it hurt you, but because the pain caused you to repent and change your ways. It was the kind of sorrow God wants his people to have, so you were not harmed by us in any way. 
2CO.7.10	For the kind of sorrow God wants us to experience leads us away from sin and results in salvation. There’s no regret for that kind of sorrow. But worldly sorrow, which lacks repentance, results in spiritual death.
2CO.7.11	Just see what this godly sorrow produced in you! Such earnestness, such concern to clear yourselves, such indignation, such alarm, such longing to see me, such zeal, and such a readiness to punish wrong. You showed that you have done everything necessary to make things right. 
2CO.7.12	My purpose, then, was not to write about who did the wrong or who was wronged. I wrote to you so that in the sight of God you could see for yourselves how loyal you are to us. 
2CO.7.13	We have been greatly encouraged by this.
2CO.7.13	In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was about the way all of you welcomed him and set his mind
2CO.7.14	I had told him how proud I was of you—and you didn’t disappoint me. I have always told you the truth, and now my boasting to Titus has also proved true! 
2CO.7.15	Now he cares for you more than ever when he remembers the way all of you obeyed him and welcomed him with such fear and deep respect. 
2CO.7.16	I am very happy now because I have complete confidence in you.
2CO.8.1	Now I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters,
2CO.8.2	They are being tested by many troubles, and they are very poor. But they are also filled with abundant joy, which has overflowed in rich generosity.
2CO.8.3	For I can testify that they gave not only what they could afford, but far more. And they did it of their own free will. 
2CO.8.4	They begged us again and again for the privilege of sharing in the gift for the believers in Jerusalem.
2CO.8.5	They even did more than we had hoped, for their first action was to give themselves to the Lord and to us, just as God wanted them to do.
2CO.8.6	So we have urged Titus, who encouraged your giving in the first place, to return to you and encourage you to finish this ministry of giving. 
2CO.8.7	Since you excel in so many ways—in your faith, your gifted speakers, your knowledge, your enthusiasm, and your love from us
2CO.8.8	I am not commanding you to do this. But I am testing how genuine your love is by comparing it with the eagerness of the other churches.
2CO.8.9	You know the generous grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty he could make you rich.
2CO.8.10	Here is my advice: It would be good for you to finish what you started a year ago. Last year you were the first who wanted to give, and you were the first to begin doing it. 
2CO.8.11	Now you should finish what you started. Let the eagerness you showed in the beginning be matched now by your giving. Give in proportion to what you have. 
2CO.8.12	Whatever you give is acceptable if you give it eagerly. And give according to what you have, not what you don’t have. 
2CO.8.13	Of course, I don’t mean your giving should make life easy for others and hard for yourselves. I only mean that there should be some equality. 
2CO.8.14	Right now you have plenty and can help those who are in need. Later, they will have plenty and can share with you when you need it. In this way, things will be equal. 
2CO.8.15	As the Scriptures say,
2CO.8.15	“Those who gathered a lot had nothing left over,
2CO.8.15	and those who gathered only a little had enough.”
2CO.8.16	But thank God! He has given Titus the same enthusiasm for you that I have. 
2CO.8.17	Titus welcomed our request that he visit you again. In fact, he himself was very eager to go and see you. 
2CO.8.18	We are also sending another brother with Titus. All the churches praise him as a preacher of the Good News. 
2CO.8.19	He was appointed by the churches to accompany us as we take the offering to Jerusalem
2CO.8.20	We are traveling together to guard against any criticism for the way we are handling this generous gift. 
2CO.8.21	We are careful to be honorable before the Lord, but we also want everyone else to see that we are honorable.
2CO.8.22	We are also sending with them another of our brothers who has proven himself many times and has shown on many occasions how eager he is. He is now even more enthusiastic because of his great confidence in you. 
2CO.8.23	If anyone asks about Titus, say that he is my partner who works with me to help you. And the brothers with him have been sent by the churches,
2CO.8.24	So show them your love, and prove to all the churches that our boasting about you is justified.
2CO.9.1	I really don’t need to write to you about this ministry of giving for the believers in Jerusalem.
2CO.9.2	For I know how eager you are to help, and I have been boasting to the churches in Macedonia that you in Greece
2CO.9.3	But I am sending these brothers to be sure you really are ready, as I have been telling them, and that your money is all collected. I don’t want to be wrong in my boasting about you. 
2CO.9.4	We would be embarrassed—not to mention your own embarrassment—if some Macedonian believers came with me and found that you weren’t ready after all I had told them! 
2CO.9.5	So I thought I should send these brothers ahead of me to make sure the gift you promised is ready. But I want it to be a willing gift, not one given grudgingly.
2CO.9.6	Remember this—a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop. But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop. 
2CO.9.7	You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don’t give reluctantly or in response to pressure. “For God loves a person who gives cheerfully.”
2CO.9.8	And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others. 
2CO.9.9	As the Scriptures say, 
2CO.9.9	“They share freely and give generously to the poor.
2CO.9.9	Their good deeds will be remembered forever.”
2CO.9.10	For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat. In the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity
2CO.9.11	Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous. And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God. 
2CO.9.12	So two good things will result from this ministry of giving—the needs of the believers in Jerusalem
2CO.9.13	As a result of your ministry, they will give glory to God. For your generosity to them and to all believers will prove that you are obedient to the Good News of Christ. 
2CO.9.14	And they will pray for you with deep affection because of the overflowing grace God has given to you. 
2CO.9.15	Thank God for this gift
2CO.10.1	Now I, Paul, appeal to you with the gentleness and kindness of Christ—though I realize you think I am timid in person and bold only when I write from far away. 
2CO.10.2	Well, I am begging you now so that when I come I won’t have to be bold with those who think we act from human motives.
2CO.10.3	We are human, but we don’t wage war as humans do. 
2CO.10.4	We use God’s mighty weapons, not worldly weapons, to knock down the strongholds of human reasoning and to destroy false arguments. 
2CO.10.5	We destroy every proud obstacle that keeps people from knowing God. We capture their rebellious thoughts and teach them to obey Christ. 
2CO.10.6	And after you have become fully obedient, we will punish everyone who remains disobedient.
2CO.10.7	Look at the obvious facts.
2CO.10.8	I may seem to be boasting too much about the authority given to us by the Lord. But our authority builds you up; it doesn’t tear you down. So I will not be ashamed of using my authority.
2CO.10.9	I’m not trying to frighten you by my letters. 
2CO.10.10	For some say, “Paul’s letters are demanding and forceful, but in person he is weak, and his speeches are worthless!” 
2CO.10.11	Those people should realize that our actions when we arrive in person will be as forceful as what we say in our letters from far away.
2CO.10.12	Oh, don’t worry; we wouldn’t dare say that we are as wonderful as these other men who tell you how important they are! But they are only comparing themselves with each other, using themselves as the standard of measurement. How ignorant!
2CO.10.13	We will not boast about things done outside our area of authority. We will boast only about what has happened within the boundaries of the work God has given us, which includes our working with you. 
2CO.10.14	We are not reaching beyond these boundaries when we claim authority over you, as if we had never visited you. For we were the first to travel all the way to Corinth with the Good News of Christ.
2CO.10.15	Nor do we boast and claim credit for the work someone else has done. Instead, we hope that your faith will grow so that the boundaries of our work among you will be extended. 
2CO.10.16	Then we will be able to go and preach the Good News in other places far beyond you, where no one else is working. Then there will be no question of our boasting about work done in someone else’s territory. 
2CO.10.17	As the Scriptures say, “If you want to boast, boast only about the 
2CO.10.18	When people commend themselves, it doesn’t count for much. The important thing is for the Lord to commend them.
2CO.11.1	I hope you will put up with a little more of my foolishness. Please bear with me. 
2CO.11.2	For I am jealous for you with the jealousy of God himself. I promised you as a pure bride
2CO.11.3	But I fear that somehow your pure and undivided devotion to Christ will be corrupted, just as Eve was deceived by the cunning ways of the serpent. 
2CO.11.4	You happily put up with whatever anyone tells you, even if they preach a different Jesus than the one we preach, or a different kind of Spirit than the one you received, or a different kind of gospel than the one you believed.
2CO.11.5	But I don’t consider myself inferior in any way to these “super apostles” who teach such things. 
2CO.11.6	I may be unskilled as a speaker, but I’m not lacking in knowledge. We have made this clear to you in every possible way.
2CO.11.7	Was I wrong when I humbled myself and honored you by preaching God’s Good News to you without expecting anything in return? 
2CO.11.8	I “robbed” other churches by accepting their contributions so I could serve you at no cost. 
2CO.11.9	And when I was with you and didn’t have enough to live on, I did not become a financial burden to anyone. For the brothers who came from Macedonia brought me all that I needed. I have never been a burden to you, and I never will be. 
2CO.11.10	As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, no one in all of Greece
2CO.11.11	Why? Because I don’t love you? God knows that I do.
2CO.11.12	But I will continue doing what I have always done. This will undercut those who are looking for an opportunity to boast that their work is just like ours. 
2CO.11.13	These people are false apostles. They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ. 
2CO.11.14	But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	So it is no wonder that his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. In the end they will get the punishment their wicked deeds deserve.
2CO.11.16	Again I say, don’t think that I am a fool to talk like this. But even if you do, listen to me, as you would to a foolish person, while I also boast a little. 
2CO.11.17	Such boasting is not from the Lord, but I am acting like a fool. 
2CO.11.18	And since others boast about their human achievements, I will, too. 
2CO.11.19	After all, you think you are so wise, but you enjoy putting up with fools! 
2CO.11.20	You put up with it when someone enslaves you, takes everything you have, takes advantage of you, takes control of everything, and slaps you in the face. 
2CO.11.21	I’m ashamed to say that we’ve been too “weak” to do that!
2CO.11.21	But whatever they dare to boast about—I’m talking like a fool again—I dare to boast about it, too. 
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. 
2CO.11.23	Are they servants of Christ? I know I sound like a madman, but I have served him far more! I have worked harder, been put in prison more often, been whipped times without number, and faced death again and again. 
2CO.11.24	Five different times the Jewish leaders gave me thirty-nine lashes. 
2CO.11.25	Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. Once I spent a whole night and a day adrift at sea. 
2CO.11.26	I have traveled on many long journeys. I have faced danger from rivers and from robbers. I have faced danger from my own people, the Jews, as well as from the Gentiles. I have faced danger in the cities, in the deserts, and on the seas. And I have faced danger from men who claim to be believers but are not.
2CO.11.27	I have worked hard and long, enduring many sleepless nights. I have been hungry and thirsty and have often gone without food. I have shivered in the cold, without enough clothing to keep me warm.
2CO.11.28	Then, besides all this, I have the daily burden of my concern for all the churches. 
2CO.11.29	Who is weak without my feeling that weakness? Who is led astray, and I do not burn with anger?
2CO.11.30	If I must boast, I would rather boast about the things that show how weak I am. 
2CO.11.31	God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, who is worthy of eternal praise, knows I am not lying. 
2CO.11.32	When I was in Damascus, the governor under King Aretas kept guards at the city gates to catch me. 
2CO.11.33	I had to be lowered in a basket through a window in the city wall to escape from him.
2CO.12.1	This boasting will do no good, but I must go on. I will reluctantly tell about visions and revelations from the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	I
2CO.12.3	Yes, only God knows whether I was in my body or outside my body. But I do know 
2CO.12.4	that I was caught up
2CO.12.5	That experience is worth boasting about, but I’m not going to do it. I will boast only about my weaknesses. 
2CO.12.6	If I wanted to boast, I would be no fool in doing so, because I would be telling the truth. But I won’t do it, because I don’t want anyone to give me credit beyond what they can see in my life or hear in my message, 
2CO.12.7	even though I have received such wonderful revelations from God. So to keep me from becoming proud, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud.
2CO.12.8	Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away. 
2CO.12.9	Each time he said, 
2CO.12.10	That’s why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
2CO.12.11	You have made me act like a fool. You ought to be writing commendations for me, for I am not at all inferior to these “super apostles,” even though I am nothing at all. 
2CO.12.12	When I was with you, I certainly gave you proof that I am an apostle. For I patiently did many signs and wonders and miracles among you. 
2CO.12.13	The only thing I failed to do, which I do in the other churches, was to become a financial burden to you. Please forgive me for this wrong!
2CO.12.14	Now I am coming to you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. I don’t want what you have—I want you. After all, children don’t provide for their parents. Rather, parents provide for their children. 
2CO.12.15	I will gladly spend myself and all I have for you, even though it seems that the more I love you, the less you love me.
2CO.12.16	Some of you admit I was not a burden to you. But others still think I was sneaky and took advantage of you by trickery. 
2CO.12.17	But how? Did any of the men I sent to you take advantage of you? 
2CO.12.18	When I urged Titus to visit you and sent our other brother with him, did Titus take advantage of you? No! For we have the same spirit and walk in each other’s steps, doing things the same way.
2CO.12.19	Perhaps you think we’re saying these things just to defend ourselves. No, we tell you this as Christ’s servants, and with God as our witness. Everything we do, dear friends, is to strengthen you. 
2CO.12.20	For I am afraid that when I come I won’t like what I find, and you won’t like my response. I am afraid that I will find quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly behavior. 
2CO.12.21	Yes, I am afraid that when I come again, God will humble me in your presence. And I will be grieved because many of you have not given up your old sins. You have not repented of your impurity, sexual immorality, and eagerness for lustful pleasure.
2CO.13.1	This is the third time I am coming to visit you (and as the Scriptures say, “The facts of every case must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses”
2CO.13.2	I have already warned those who had been sinning when I was there on my second visit. Now I again warn them and all others, just as I did before, that next time I will not spare them.
2CO.13.3	I will give you all the proof you want that Christ speaks through me. Christ is not weak when he deals with you; he is powerful among you. 
2CO.13.4	Although he was crucified in weakness, he now lives by the power of God. We, too, are weak, just as Christ was, but when we deal with you we will be alive with him and will have God’s power.
2CO.13.5	Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves. Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you
2CO.13.6	As you test yourselves, I hope you will recognize that we have not failed the test of apostolic authority.
2CO.13.7	We pray to God that you will not do what is wrong by refusing our correction. I hope we won’t need to demonstrate our authority when we arrive. Do the right thing before we come—even if that makes it look like we have failed to demonstrate our authority. 
2CO.13.8	For we cannot oppose the truth, but must always stand for the truth. 
2CO.13.9	We are glad to seem weak if it helps show that you are actually strong. We pray that you will become mature.
2CO.13.10	I am writing this to you before I come, hoping that I won’t need to deal severely with you when I do come. For I want to use the authority the Lord has given me to strengthen you, not to tear you down.
2CO.13.11	Dear brothers and sisters,
2CO.13.12	Greet each other with a sacred kiss. 
2CO.13.13	All of God’s people here send you their greetings.
2CO.13.14	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
GAL.1.1	This letter is from Paul, an apostle. I was not appointed by any group of people or any human authority, but by Jesus Christ himself and by God the Father, who raised Jesus from the dead.
GAL.1.2	All the brothers and sisters
GAL.1.3	May God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ
GAL.1.4	Jesus gave his life for our sins, just as God our Father planned, in order to rescue us from this evil world in which we live. 
GAL.1.5	All glory to God forever and ever! Amen.
GAL.1.6	I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ.
GAL.1.7	but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ.
GAL.1.8	Let God’s curse fall on anyone, including us or even an angel from heaven, who preaches a different kind of Good News than the one we preached to you. 
GAL.1.9	I say again what we have said before: If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you welcomed, let that person be cursed.
GAL.1.10	Obviously, I’m not trying to win the approval of people, but of God. If pleasing people were my goal, I would not be Christ’s servant.
GAL.1.11	Dear brothers and sisters, I want you to understand that the gospel message I preach is not based on mere human reasoning. 
GAL.1.12	I received my message from no human source, and no one taught me. Instead, I received it by direct revelation from Jesus Christ.
GAL.1.13	You know what I was like when I followed the Jewish religion—how I violently persecuted God’s church. I did my best to destroy it. 
GAL.1.14	I was far ahead of my fellow Jews in my zeal for the traditions of my ancestors.
GAL.1.15	But even before I was born, God chose me and called me by his marvelous grace. Then it pleased him 
GAL.1.16	to reveal his Son to me
GAL.1.16	When this happened, I did not rush out to consult with any human being.
GAL.1.17	Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to consult with those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went away into Arabia, and later I returned to the city of Damascus.
GAL.1.18	Then three years later I went to Jerusalem to get to know Peter,
GAL.1.19	The only other apostle I met at that time was James, the Lord’s brother. 
GAL.1.20	I declare before God that what I am writing to you is not a lie.
GAL.1.21	After that visit I went north into the provinces of Syria and Cilicia. 
GAL.1.22	And still the churches in Christ that are in Judea didn’t know me personally. 
GAL.1.23	All they knew was that people were saying, “The one who used to persecute us is now preaching the very faith he tried to destroy!” 
GAL.1.24	And they praised God because of me.
GAL.2.1	Then fourteen years later I went back to Jerusalem again, this time with Barnabas; and Titus came along, too. 
GAL.2.2	I went there because God revealed to me that I should go. While I was there I met privately with those considered to be leaders of the church and shared with them the message I had been preaching to the Gentiles. I wanted to make sure that we were in agreement, for fear that all my efforts had been wasted and I was running the race for nothing. 
GAL.2.3	And they supported me and did not even demand that my companion Titus be circumcised, though he was a Gentile.
GAL.2.4	Even that question came up only because of some so-called believers there—false ones, really
GAL.2.5	But we refused to give in to them for a single moment. We wanted to preserve the truth of the gospel message for you.
GAL.2.6	And the leaders of the church had nothing to add to what I was preaching. (By the way, their reputation as great leaders made no difference to me, for God has no favorites.) 
GAL.2.7	Instead, they saw that God had given me the responsibility of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as he had given Peter the responsibility of preaching to the Jews. 
GAL.2.8	For the same God who worked through Peter as the apostle to the Jews also worked through me as the apostle to the Gentiles.
GAL.2.9	In fact, James, Peter,
GAL.2.10	Their only suggestion was that we keep on helping the poor, which I have always been eager to do.
GAL.2.11	But when Peter came to Antioch, I had to oppose him to his face, for what he did was very wrong. 
GAL.2.12	When he first arrived, he ate with the Gentile believers, who were not circumcised. But afterward, when some friends of James came, Peter wouldn’t eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of criticism from these people who insisted on the necessity of circumcision. 
GAL.2.13	As a result, other Jewish believers followed Peter’s hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
GAL.2.14	When I saw that they were not following the truth of the gospel message, I said to Peter in front of all the others, “Since you, a Jew by birth, have discarded the Jewish laws and are living like a Gentile, why are you now trying to make these Gentiles follow the Jewish traditions?
GAL.2.15	“You and I are Jews by birth, not ‘sinners’ like the Gentiles. 
GAL.2.16	Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.”
GAL.2.17	But suppose we seek to be made right with God through faith in Christ and then we are found guilty because we have abandoned the law. Would that mean Christ has led us into sin? Absolutely not! 
GAL.2.18	Rather, I am a sinner if I rebuild the old system of law I already tore down. 
GAL.2.19	For when I tried to keep the law, it condemned me. So I died to the law—I stopped trying to meet all its requirements—so that I might live for God. 
GAL.2.20	My old self has been crucified with Christ.
GAL.2.21	I do not treat the grace of God as meaningless. For if keeping the law could make us right with God, then there was no need for Christ to die.
GAL.3.1	Oh, foolish Galatians! Who has cast an evil spell on you? For the meaning of Jesus Christ’s death was made as clear to you as if you had seen a picture of his death on the cross. 
GAL.3.2	Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law of Moses? Of course not! You received the Spirit because you believed the message you heard about Christ. 
GAL.3.3	How foolish can you be? After starting your new lives in the Spirit, why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort? 
GAL.3.4	Have you experienced
GAL.3.5	I ask you again, does God give you the Holy Spirit and work miracles among you because you obey the law? Of course not! It is because you believe the message you heard about Christ.
GAL.3.6	In the same way, “Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.”
GAL.3.7	The real children of Abraham, then, are those who put their faith in God.
GAL.3.8	What’s more, the Scriptures looked forward to this time when God would make the Gentiles right in his sight because of their faith. God proclaimed this good news to Abraham long ago when he said, “All nations will be blessed through you.”
GAL.3.9	So all who put their faith in Christ share the same blessing Abraham received because of his faith.
GAL.3.10	But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God’s Book of the Law.”
GAL.3.11	So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law. For the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”
GAL.3.12	This way of faith is very different from the way of law, which says, “It is through obeying the law that a person has life.”
GAL.3.13	But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law. When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing. For it is written in the Scriptures, “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.”
GAL.3.14	Through Christ Jesus, God has blessed the Gentiles with the same blessing he promised to Abraham, so that we who are believers might receive the promised
GAL.3.15	Dear brothers and sisters,
GAL.3.16	God gave the promises to Abraham and his child.
GAL.3.17	This is what I am trying to say: The agreement God made with Abraham could not be canceled 430 years later when God gave the law to Moses. God would be breaking his promise. 
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance could be received by keeping the law, then it would not be the result of accepting God’s promise. But God graciously gave it to Abraham as a promise.
GAL.3.19	Why, then, was the law given? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised. God gave his law through angels to Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people. 
GAL.3.20	Now a mediator is helpful if more than one party must reach an agreement. But God, who is one, did not use a mediator when he gave his promise to Abraham.
GAL.3.21	Is there a conflict, then, between God’s law and God’s promises?
GAL.3.22	But the Scriptures declare that we are all prisoners of sin, so we receive God’s promise of freedom only by believing in Jesus Christ.
GAL.3.23	Before the way of faith in Christ was available to us, we were placed under guard by the law. We were kept in protective custody, so to speak, until the way of faith was revealed.
GAL.3.24	Let me put it another way. The law was our guardian until Christ came; it protected us until we could be made right with God through faith. 
GAL.3.25	And now that the way of faith has come, we no longer need the law as our guardian.
GAL.3.26	For you are all children
GAL.3.27	And all who have been united with Christ in baptism have put on Christ, like putting on new clothes.
GAL.3.28	There is no longer Jew or Gentile,
GAL.3.29	And now that you belong to Christ, you are the true children
GAL.4.1	Think of it this way. If a father dies and leaves an inheritance for his young children, those children are not much better off than slaves until they grow up, even though they actually own everything their father had. 
GAL.4.2	They have to obey their guardians until they reach whatever age their father set. 
GAL.4.3	And that’s the way it was with us before Christ came. We were like children; we were slaves to the basic spiritual principles
GAL.4.4	But when the right time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, subject to the law. 
GAL.4.5	God sent him to buy freedom for us who were slaves to the law, so that he could adopt us as his very own children.
GAL.4.6	And because we
GAL.4.7	Now you are no longer a slave but God’s own child.
GAL.4.8	Before you Gentiles knew God, you were slaves to so-called gods that do not even exist. 
GAL.4.9	So now that you know God (or should I say, now that God knows you), why do you want to go back again and become slaves once more to the weak and useless spiritual principles of this world? 
GAL.4.10	You are trying to earn favor with God by observing certain days or months or seasons or years. 
GAL.4.11	I fear for you. Perhaps all my hard work with you was for nothing. 
GAL.4.12	Dear brothers and sisters,
GAL.4.12	You did not mistreat me when I first preached to you. 
GAL.4.13	Surely you remember that I was sick when I first brought you the Good News. 
GAL.4.14	But even though my condition tempted you to reject me, you did not despise me or turn me away. No, you took me in and cared for me as though I were an angel from God or even Christ Jesus himself. 
GAL.4.15	Where is that joyful and grateful spirit you felt then? I am sure you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if it had been possible. 
GAL.4.16	Have I now become your enemy because I am telling you the truth?
GAL.4.17	Those false teachers are so eager to win your favor, but their intentions are not good. They are trying to shut you off from me so that you will pay attention only to them. 
GAL.4.18	If someone is eager to do good things for you, that’s all right; but let them do it all the time, not just when I’m with you.
GAL.4.19	Oh, my dear children! I feel as if I’m going through labor pains for you again, and they will continue until Christ is fully developed in your lives. 
GAL.4.20	I wish I were with you right now so I could change my tone. But at this distance I don’t know how else to help you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, you who want to live under the law, do you know what the law actually says? 
GAL.4.22	The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons, one from his slave wife and one from his freeborn wife.
GAL.4.23	The son of the slave wife was born in a human attempt to bring about the fulfillment of God’s promise. But the son of the freeborn wife was born as God’s own fulfillment of his promise.
GAL.4.24	These two women serve as an illustration of God’s two covenants. The first woman, Hagar, represents Mount Sinai where people received the law that enslaved them. 
GAL.4.25	And now Jerusalem is just like Mount Sinai in Arabia,
GAL.4.26	But the other woman, Sarah, represents the heavenly Jerusalem. She is the free woman, and she is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	As Isaiah said, 
GAL.4.27	“Rejoice, O childless woman,
GAL.4.27	you who have never given birth!
GAL.4.27	Break into a joyful shout,
GAL.4.27	you who have never been in labor!
GAL.4.27	For the desolate woman now has more children
GAL.4.27	than the woman who lives with her husband!”
GAL.4.28	And you, dear brothers and sisters, are children of the promise, just like Isaac. 
GAL.4.29	But you are now being persecuted by those who want you to keep the law, just as Ishmael, the child born by human effort, persecuted Isaac, the child born by the power of the Spirit.
GAL.4.30	But what do the Scriptures say about that? “Get rid of the slave and her son, for the son of the slave woman will not share the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”
GAL.4.31	So, dear brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman; we are children of the free woman.
GAL.5.1	So Christ has truly set us free. Now make sure that you stay free, and don’t get tied up again in slavery to the law.
GAL.5.2	Listen! I, Paul, tell you this: If you are counting on circumcision to make you right with God, then Christ will be of no benefit to you. 
GAL.5.3	I’ll say it again. If you are trying to find favor with God by being circumcised, you must obey every regulation in the whole law of Moses. 
GAL.5.4	For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law, you have been cut off from Christ! You have fallen away from God’s grace.
GAL.5.5	But we who live by the Spirit eagerly wait to receive by faith the righteousness God has promised to us. 
GAL.5.6	For when we place our faith in Christ Jesus, there is no benefit in being circumcised or being uncircumcised. What is important is faith expressing itself in love.
GAL.5.7	You were running the race so well. Who has held you back from following the truth? 
GAL.5.8	It certainly isn’t God, for he is the one who called you to freedom. 
GAL.5.9	This false teaching is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough! 
GAL.5.10	I am trusting the Lord to keep you from believing false teachings. God will judge that person, whoever he is, who has been confusing you.
GAL.5.11	Dear brothers and sisters,
GAL.5.12	I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would mutilate themselves.
GAL.5.13	For you have been called to live in freedom, my brothers and sisters. But don’t use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature. Instead, use your freedom to serve one another in love. 
GAL.5.14	For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”
GAL.5.15	But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out! Beware of destroying one another.
GAL.5.16	So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won’t be doing what your sinful nature craves. 
GAL.5.17	The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions. 
GAL.5.18	But when you are directed by the Spirit, you are not under obligation to the law of Moses.
GAL.5.19	When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures, 
GAL.5.20	idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division, 
GAL.5.21	envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
GAL.5.22	But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
GAL.5.23	gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!
GAL.5.24	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there. 
GAL.5.25	Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit’s leading in every part of our lives. 
GAL.5.26	Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another.
GAL.6.1	Dear brothers and sisters, if another believer
GAL.6.2	Share each other’s burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ. 
GAL.6.3	If you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself. You are not that important.
GAL.6.4	Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won’t need to compare yourself to anyone else. 
GAL.6.5	For we are each responsible for our own conduct.
GAL.6.6	Those who are taught the word of God should provide for their teachers, sharing all good things with them.
GAL.6.7	Don’t be misled—you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant. 
GAL.6.8	Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit. 
GAL.6.9	So let’s not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don’t give up. 
GAL.6.10	Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do good to everyone—especially to those in the family of faith.
GAL.6.12	Those who are trying to force you to be circumcised want to look good to others. They don’t want to be persecuted for teaching that the cross of Christ alone can save. 
GAL.6.13	And even those who advocate circumcision don’t keep the whole law themselves. They only want you to be circumcised so they can boast about it and claim you as their disciples.
GAL.6.14	As for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that cross,
GAL.6.15	It doesn’t matter whether we have been circumcised or not. What counts is whether we have been transformed into a new creation. 
GAL.6.16	May God’s peace and mercy be upon all who live by this principle; they are the new people of God.
GAL.6.17	From now on, don’t let anyone trouble me with these things. For I bear on my body the scars that show I belong to Jesus.
GAL.6.18	Dear brothers and sisters,
EPH.1.1	This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus.
EPH.1.1	I am writing to God’s holy people in Ephesus,
EPH.1.2	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
EPH.1.3	All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ. 
EPH.1.4	Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes. 
EPH.1.5	God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. 
EPH.1.6	So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear Son.
EPH.1.7	He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins. 
EPH.1.8	He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding.
EPH.1.9	God has now revealed to us his mysterious will regarding Christ—which is to fulfill his own good plan. 
EPH.1.10	And this is the plan: At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ—everything in heaven and on earth. 
EPH.1.11	Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance from God,
EPH.1.12	God’s purpose was that we Jews who were the first to trust in Christ would bring praise and glory to God. 
EPH.1.13	And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, the Good News that God saves you. And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own
EPH.1.14	The Spirit is God’s guarantee that he will give us the inheritance he promised and that he has purchased us to be his own people. He did this so we would praise and glorify him.
EPH.1.15	Ever since I first heard of your strong faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for God’s people everywhere,
EPH.1.16	I have not stopped thanking God for you. I pray for you constantly, 
EPH.1.17	asking God, the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to give you spiritual wisdom
EPH.1.18	I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called—his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance.
EPH.1.19	I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God’s power for us who believe him. This is the same mighty power 
EPH.1.20	that raised Christ from the dead and seated him in the place of honor at God’s right hand in the heavenly realms. 
EPH.1.21	Now he is far above any ruler or authority or power or leader or anything else—not only in this world but also in the world to come. 
EPH.1.22	God has put all things under the authority of Christ and has made him head over all things for the benefit of the church. 
EPH.1.23	And the church is his body; it is made full and complete by Christ, who fills all things everywhere with himself.
EPH.2.1	Once you were dead because of your disobedience and your many sins. 
EPH.2.2	You used to live in sin, just like the rest of the world, obeying the devil—the commander of the powers in the unseen world.
EPH.2.3	All of us used to live that way, following the passionate desires and inclinations of our sinful nature. By our very nature we were subject to God’s anger, just like everyone else.
EPH.2.4	But God is so rich in mercy, and he loved us so much, 
EPH.2.5	that even though we were dead because of our sins, he gave us life when he raised Christ from the dead. (It is only by God’s grace that you have been saved!) 
EPH.2.6	For he raised us from the dead along with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ Jesus. 
EPH.2.7	So God can point to us in all future ages as examples of the incredible wealth of his grace and kindness toward us, as shown in all he has done for us who are united with Christ Jesus.
EPH.2.8	God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God. 
EPH.2.9	Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. 
EPH.2.10	For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.
EPH.2.11	Don’t forget that you Gentiles used to be outsiders. You were called “uncircumcised heathens” by the Jews, who were proud of their circumcision, even though it affected only their bodies and not their hearts. 
EPH.2.12	In those days you were living apart from Christ. You were excluded from citizenship among the people of Israel, and you did not know the covenant promises God had made to them. You lived in this world without God and without hope. 
EPH.2.13	But now you have been united with Christ Jesus. Once you were far away from God, but now you have been brought near to him through the blood of Christ.
EPH.2.14	For Christ himself has brought peace to us. He united Jews and Gentiles into one people when, in his own body on the cross, he broke down the wall of hostility that separated us. 
EPH.2.15	He did this by ending the system of law with its commandments and regulations. He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself one new people from the two groups. 
EPH.2.16	Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of his death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to death.
EPH.2.17	He brought this Good News of peace to you Gentiles who were far away from him, and peace to the Jews who were near. 
EPH.2.18	Now all of us can come to the Father through the same Holy Spirit because of what Christ has done for us.
EPH.2.19	So now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. You are citizens along with all of God’s holy people. You are members of God’s family. 
EPH.2.20	Together, we are his house, built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets. And the cornerstone is Christ Jesus himself. 
EPH.2.21	We are carefully joined together in him, becoming a holy temple for the Lord. 
EPH.2.22	Through him you Gentiles are also being made part of this dwelling where God lives by his Spirit.
EPH.3.1	When I think of all this, I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus for the benefit of you Gentiles
EPH.3.2	assuming, by the way, that you know God gave me the special responsibility of extending his grace to you Gentiles. 
EPH.3.3	As I briefly wrote earlier, God himself revealed his mysterious plan to me. 
EPH.3.4	As you read what I have written, you will understand my insight into this plan regarding Christ. 
EPH.3.5	God did not reveal it to previous generations, but now by his Spirit he has revealed it to his holy apostles and prophets.
EPH.3.6	And this is God’s plan: Both Gentiles and Jews who believe the Good News share equally in the riches inherited by God’s children. Both are part of the same body, and both enjoy the promise of blessings because they belong to Christ Jesus.
EPH.3.7	By God’s grace and mighty power, I have been given the privilege of serving him by spreading this Good News.
EPH.3.8	Though I am the least deserving of all God’s people, he graciously gave me the privilege of telling the Gentiles about the endless treasures available to them in Christ. 
EPH.3.9	I was chosen to explain to everyone
EPH.3.10	God’s purpose in all this was to use the church to display his wisdom in its rich variety to all the unseen rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. 
EPH.3.11	This was his eternal plan, which he carried out through Christ Jesus our Lord.
EPH.3.12	Because of Christ and our faith in him,
EPH.3.13	So please don’t lose heart because of my trials here. I am suffering for you, so you should feel honored.
EPH.3.14	When I think of all this, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father,
EPH.3.15	the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth.
EPH.3.16	I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit. 
EPH.3.17	Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you strong. 
EPH.3.18	And may you have the power to understand, as all God’s people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is. 
EPH.3.19	May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God.
EPH.3.20	Now all glory to God, who is able, through his mighty power at work within us, to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think. 
EPH.3.21	Glory to him in the church and in Christ Jesus through all generations forever and ever! Amen.
EPH.4.1	Therefore I, a prisoner for serving the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling, for you have been called by God. 
EPH.4.2	Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other’s faults because of your love. 
EPH.4.3	Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace. 
EPH.4.4	For there is one body and one Spirit, just as you have been called to one glorious hope for the future.
EPH.4.5	There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of all,
EPH.4.6	who is over all, in all, and living through all.
EPH.4.7	However, he has given each one of us a special gift
EPH.4.8	That is why the Scriptures say, 
EPH.4.8	“When he ascended to the heights,
EPH.4.8	he led a crowd of captives
EPH.4.8	and gave gifts to his people.”
EPH.4.9	Notice that it says “he ascended.” This clearly means that Christ also descended to our lowly world.
EPH.4.10	And the same one who descended is the one who ascended higher than all the heavens, so that he might fill the entire universe with himself.
EPH.4.11	Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers. 
EPH.4.12	Their responsibility is to equip God’s people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ. 
EPH.4.13	This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God’s Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.
EPH.4.14	Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won’t be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth. 
EPH.4.15	Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church. 
EPH.4.16	He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.
EPH.4.17	With the Lord’s authority I say this: Live no longer as the Gentiles do, for they are hopelessly confused. 
EPH.4.18	Their minds are full of darkness; they wander far from the life God gives because they have closed their minds and hardened their hearts against him. 
EPH.4.19	They have no sense of shame. They live for lustful pleasure and eagerly practice every kind of impurity.
EPH.4.20	But that isn’t what you learned about Christ. 
EPH.4.21	Since you have heard about Jesus and have learned the truth that comes from him, 
EPH.4.22	throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception. 
EPH.4.23	Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. 
EPH.4.24	Put on your new nature, created to be like God—truly righteous and holy.
EPH.4.25	So stop telling lies. Let us tell our neighbors the truth, for we are all parts of the same body. 
EPH.4.26	And “don’t sin by letting anger control you.”
EPH.4.27	for anger gives a foothold to the devil.
EPH.4.28	If you are a thief, quit stealing. Instead, use your hands for good hard work, and then give generously to others in need. 
EPH.4.29	Don’t use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.
EPH.4.30	And do not bring sorrow to God’s Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own,
EPH.4.31	Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behavior. 
EPH.4.32	Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.
EPH.5.1	Imitate God, therefore, in everything you do, because you are his dear children. 
EPH.5.2	Live a life filled with love, following the example of Christ. He loved us
EPH.5.3	Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God’s people. 
EPH.5.4	Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes—these are not for you. Instead, let there be thankfulness to God. 
EPH.5.5	You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.
EPH.5.6	Don’t be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of God will fall on all who disobey him. 
EPH.5.7	Don’t participate in the things these people do. 
EPH.5.8	For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light! 
EPH.5.9	For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true.
EPH.5.10	Carefully determine what pleases the Lord. 
EPH.5.11	Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them. 
EPH.5.12	It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret. 
EPH.5.13	But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them, 
EPH.5.14	for the light makes everything visible. This is why it is said, 
EPH.5.14	“Awake, O sleeper,
EPH.5.14	rise up from the dead,
EPH.5.14	and Christ will give you light.”
EPH.5.15	So be careful how you live. Don’t live like fools, but like those who are wise. 
EPH.5.16	Make the most of every opportunity in these evil days. 
EPH.5.17	Don’t act thoughtlessly, but understand what the Lord wants you to do. 
EPH.5.18	Don’t be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit, 
EPH.5.19	singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, and making music to the Lord in your hearts. 
EPH.5.20	And give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.5.21	And further, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
EPH.5.22	For wives, this means submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 
EPH.5.23	For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. He is the Savior of his body, the church. 
EPH.5.24	As the church submits to Christ, so you wives should submit to your husbands in everything.
EPH.5.25	For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her 
EPH.5.26	to make her holy and clean, washed by the cleansing of God’s word.
EPH.5.27	He did this to present her to himself as a glorious church without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead, she will be holy and without fault. 
EPH.5.28	In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as they love their own bodies. For a man who loves his wife actually shows love for himself. 
EPH.5.29	No one hates his own body but feeds and cares for it, just as Christ cares for the church. 
EPH.5.30	And we are members of his body.
EPH.5.31	As the Scriptures say, “A man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.”
EPH.5.32	This is a great mystery, but it is an illustration of the way Christ and the church are one. 
EPH.5.33	So again I say, each man must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents because you belong to the Lord,
EPH.6.2	“Honor your father and mother.” This is the first commandment with a promise: 
EPH.6.3	If you honor your father and mother, “things will go well for you, and you will have a long life on the earth.”
EPH.6.4	Fathers,
EPH.6.5	Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. 
EPH.6.6	Try to please them all the time, not just when they are watching you. As slaves of Christ, do the will of God with all your heart. 
EPH.6.7	Work with enthusiasm, as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people. 
EPH.6.8	Remember that the Lord will reward each one of us for the good we do, whether we are slaves or free.
EPH.6.9	Masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Don’t threaten them; remember, you both have the same Master in heaven, and he has no favorites.
EPH.6.10	A final word: Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 
EPH.6.11	Put on all of God’s armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil. 
EPH.6.12	For we
EPH.6.13	Therefore, put on every piece of God’s armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm. 
EPH.6.14	Stand your ground, putting on the belt of truth and the body armor of God’s righteousness. 
EPH.6.15	For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you will be fully prepared.
EPH.6.16	In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil.
EPH.6.17	Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
EPH.6.18	Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere.
EPH.6.19	And pray for me, too. Ask God to give me the right words so I can boldly explain God’s mysterious plan that the Good News is for Jews and Gentiles alike.
EPH.6.20	I am in chains now, still preaching this message as God’s ambassador. So pray that I will keep on speaking boldly for him, as I should.
EPH.6.21	To bring you up to date, Tychicus will give you a full report about what I am doing and how I am getting along. He is a beloved brother and faithful helper in the Lord’s work. 
EPH.6.22	I have sent him to you for this very purpose—to let you know how we are doing and to encourage you.
EPH.6.23	Peace be with you, dear brothers and sisters,
EPH.6.24	May God’s grace be eternally upon all who love our Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.1	This letter is from Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus.
PHP.1.1	I am writing to all of God’s holy people in Philippi who belong to Christ Jesus, including the church leaders
PHP.1.2	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
PHP.1.3	Every time I think of you, I give thanks to my God. 
PHP.1.4	Whenever I pray, I make my requests for all of you with joy, 
PHP.1.5	for you have been my partners in spreading the Good News about Christ from the time you first heard it until now. 
PHP.1.6	And I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns.
PHP.1.7	So it is right that I should feel as I do about all of you, for you have a special place in my heart. You share with me the special favor of God, both in my imprisonment and in defending and confirming the truth of the Good News. 
PHP.1.8	God knows how much I love you and long for you with the tender compassion of Christ Jesus.
PHP.1.9	I pray that your love will overflow more and more, and that you will keep on growing in knowledge and understanding. 
PHP.1.10	For I want you to understand what really matters, so that you may live pure and blameless lives until the day of Christ’s return. 
PHP.1.11	May you always be filled with the fruit of your salvation—the righteous character produced in your life by Jesus Christ
PHP.1.12	And I want you to know, my dear brothers and sisters,
PHP.1.13	For everyone here, including the whole palace guard,
PHP.1.14	And because of my imprisonment, most of the believers
PHP.1.15	It’s true that some are preaching out of jealousy and rivalry. But others preach about Christ with pure motives. 
PHP.1.16	They preach because they love me, for they know I have been appointed to defend the Good News. 
PHP.1.17	Those others do not have pure motives as they preach about Christ. They preach with selfish ambition, not sincerely, intending to make my chains more painful to me. 
PHP.1.18	But that doesn’t matter. Whether their motives are false or genuine, the message about Christ is being preached either way, so I rejoice. And I will continue to rejoice. 
PHP.1.19	For I know that as you pray for me and the Spirit of Jesus Christ helps me, this will lead to my deliverance.
PHP.1.20	For I fully expect and hope that I will never be ashamed, but that I will continue to be bold for Christ, as I have been in the past. And I trust that my life will bring honor to Christ, whether I live or die. 
PHP.1.21	For to me, living means living for Christ, and dying is even better. 
PHP.1.22	But if I live, I can do more fruitful work for Christ. So I really don’t know which is better. 
PHP.1.23	I’m torn between two desires: I long to go and be with Christ, which would be far better for me. 
PHP.1.24	But for your sakes, it is better that I continue to live.
PHP.1.25	Knowing this, I am convinced that I will remain alive so I can continue to help all of you grow and experience the joy of your faith. 
PHP.1.26	And when I come to you again, you will have even more reason to take pride in Christ Jesus because of what he is doing through me.
PHP.1.27	Above all, you must live as citizens of heaven, conducting yourselves in a manner worthy of the Good News about Christ. Then, whether I come and see you again or only hear about you, I will know that you are standing together with one spirit and one purpose, fighting together for the faith, which is the Good News. 
PHP.1.28	Don’t be intimidated in any way by your enemies. This will be a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed, but that you are going to be saved, even by God himself. 
PHP.1.29	For you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ but also the privilege of suffering for him. 
PHP.1.30	We are in this struggle together. You have seen my struggle in the past, and you know that I am still in the midst of it.
PHP.2.1	Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ? Any comfort from his love? Any fellowship together in the Spirit? Are your hearts tender and compassionate? 
PHP.2.2	Then make me truly happy by agreeing wholeheartedly with each other, loving one another, and working together with one mind and purpose.
PHP.2.3	Don’t be selfish; don’t try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves. 
PHP.2.4	Don’t look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.
PHP.2.5	You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.
PHP.2.6	Though he was God,
PHP.2.6	he did not think of equality with God
PHP.2.6	as something to cling to.
PHP.2.7	Instead, he gave up his divine privileges
PHP.2.7	he took the humble position of a slave
PHP.2.7	and was born as a human being.
PHP.2.7	When he appeared in human form,
PHP.2.8	he humbled himself in obedience to God
PHP.2.8	and died a criminal’s death on a cross.
PHP.2.9	Therefore, God elevated him to the place of highest honor
PHP.2.9	and gave him the name above all other names,
PHP.2.10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
PHP.2.10	in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
PHP.2.11	and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord,
PHP.2.11	to the glory of God the Father.
PHP.2.12	Dear friends, you always followed my instructions when I was with you. And now that I am away, it is even more important. Work hard to show the results of your salvation, obeying God with deep reverence and fear. 
PHP.2.13	For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him.
PHP.2.14	Do everything without complaining and arguing, 
PHP.2.15	so that no one can criticize you. Live clean, innocent lives as children of God, shining like bright lights in a world full of crooked and perverse people. 
PHP.2.16	Hold firmly to the word of life; then, on the day of Christ’s return, I will be proud that I did not run the race in vain and that my work was not useless. 
PHP.2.17	But I will rejoice even if I lose my life, pouring it out like a liquid offering to God,
PHP.2.18	Yes, you should rejoice, and I will share your joy.
PHP.2.19	If the Lord Jesus is willing, I hope to send Timothy to you soon for a visit. Then he can cheer me up by telling me how you are getting along. 
PHP.2.20	I have no one else like Timothy, who genuinely cares about your welfare. 
PHP.2.21	All the others care only for themselves and not for what matters to Jesus Christ. 
PHP.2.22	But you know how Timothy has proved himself. Like a son with his father, he has served with me in preaching the Good News. 
PHP.2.23	I hope to send him to you just as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me here. 
PHP.2.24	And I have confidence from the Lord that I myself will come to see you soon.
PHP.2.25	Meanwhile, I thought I should send Epaphroditus back to you. He is a true brother, co-worker, and fellow soldier. And he was your messenger to help me in my need. 
PHP.2.26	I am sending him because he has been longing to see you, and he was very distressed that you heard he was ill. 
PHP.2.27	And he certainly was ill; in fact, he almost died. But God had mercy on him—and also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow after another.
PHP.2.28	So I am all the more anxious to send him back to you, for I know you will be glad to see him, and then I will not be so worried about you. 
PHP.2.29	Welcome him in the Lord’s love
PHP.2.30	For he risked his life for the work of Christ, and he was at the point of death while doing for me what you couldn’t do from far away.
PHP.3.1	Whatever happens, my dear brothers and sisters,
PHP.3.2	Watch out for those dogs, those people who do evil, those mutilators who say you must be circumcised to be saved. 
PHP.3.3	For we who worship by the Spirit of God
PHP.3.4	though I could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could. Indeed, if others have reason for confidence in their own efforts, I have even more!
PHP.3.5	I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I am a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjamin—a real Hebrew if there ever was one! I was a member of the Pharisees, who demand the strictest obedience to the Jewish law. 
PHP.3.6	I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church. And as for righteousness, I obeyed the law without fault.
PHP.3.7	I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done. 
PHP.3.8	Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ 
PHP.3.9	and become one with him. I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law; rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ.
PHP.3.10	I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead. I want to suffer with him, sharing in his death, 
PHP.3.11	so that one way or another I will experience the resurrection from the dead!
PHP.3.12	I don’t mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me. 
PHP.3.13	No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it,
PHP.3.14	I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us.
PHP.3.15	Let all who are spiritually mature agree on these things. If you disagree on some point, I believe God will make it plain to you. 
PHP.3.16	But we must hold on to the progress we have already made.
PHP.3.17	Dear brothers and sisters, pattern your lives after mine, and learn from those who follow our example. 
PHP.3.18	For I have told you often before, and I say it again with tears in my eyes, that there are many whose conduct shows they are really enemies of the cross of Christ. 
PHP.3.19	They are headed for destruction. Their god is their appetite, they brag about shameful things, and they think only about this life here on earth. 
PHP.3.20	But we are citizens of heaven, where the Lord Jesus Christ lives. And we are eagerly waiting for him to return as our Savior. 
PHP.3.21	He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies like his own, using the same power with which he will bring everything under his control.
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters,
PHP.4.2	Now I appeal to Euodia and Syntyche. Please, because you belong to the Lord, settle your disagreement. 
PHP.4.3	And I ask you, my true partner,
PHP.4.4	Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again—rejoice! 
PHP.4.5	Let everyone see that you are considerate in all you do. Remember, the Lord is coming soon.
PHP.4.6	Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. 
PHP.4.7	Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.8	And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. 
PHP.4.9	Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me—everything you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be with you.
PHP.4.10	How I praise the Lord that you are concerned about me again. I know you have always been concerned for me, but you didn’t have the chance to help me. 
PHP.4.11	Not that I was ever in need, for I have learned how to be content with whatever I have. 
PHP.4.12	I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. 
PHP.4.13	For I can do everything through Christ,
PHP.4.14	Even so, you have done well to share with me in my present difficulty.
PHP.4.15	As you know, you Philippians were the only ones who gave me financial help when I first brought you the Good News and then traveled on from Macedonia. No other church did this. 
PHP.4.16	Even when I was in Thessalonica you sent help more than once. 
PHP.4.17	I don’t say this because I want a gift from you. Rather, I want you to receive a reward for your kindness.
PHP.4.18	At the moment I have all I need—and more! I am generously supplied with the gifts you sent me with Epaphroditus. They are a sweet-smelling sacrifice that is acceptable and pleasing to God. 
PHP.4.19	And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.20	Now all glory to God our Father forever and ever! Amen.
PHP.4.21	Give my greetings to each of God’s holy people—all who belong to Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you their greetings. 
PHP.4.22	And all the rest of God’s people send you greetings, too, especially those in Caesar’s household.
PHP.4.23	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
COL.1.1	This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy.
COL.1.2	We are writing to God’s holy people in the city of Colosse, who are faithful brothers and sisters
COL.1.2	May God our Father give you grace and peace.
COL.1.3	We always pray for you, and we give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
COL.1.4	For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all of God’s people, 
COL.1.5	which come from your confident hope of what God has reserved for you in heaven. You have had this expectation ever since you first heard the truth of the Good News.
COL.1.6	This same Good News that came to you is going out all over the world. It is bearing fruit everywhere by changing lives, just as it changed your lives from the day you first heard and understood the truth about God’s wonderful grace.
COL.1.7	You learned about the Good News from Epaphras, our beloved co-worker. He is Christ’s faithful servant, and he is helping us on your behalf.
COL.1.8	He has told us about the love for others that the Holy Spirit has given you.
COL.1.9	So we have not stopped praying for you since we first heard about you. We ask God to give you complete knowledge of his will and to give you spiritual wisdom and understanding. 
COL.1.10	Then the way you live will always honor and please the Lord, and your lives will produce every kind of good fruit. All the while, you will grow as you learn to know God better and better.
COL.1.11	We also pray that you will be strengthened with all his glorious power so you will have all the endurance and patience you need. May you be filled with joy,
COL.1.12	always thanking the Father. He has enabled you to share in the inheritance that belongs to his people, who live in the light. 
COL.1.13	For he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and transferred us into the Kingdom of his dear Son, 
COL.1.14	who purchased our freedom
COL.1.15	Christ is the visible image of the invisible God.
COL.1.15	He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation,
COL.1.16	for through him God created everything
COL.1.16	in the heavenly realms and on earth.
COL.1.16	He made the things we can see
COL.1.16	and the things we can’t see—
COL.1.16	such as thrones, kingdoms, rulers, and authorities in the unseen world.
COL.1.16	Everything was created through him and for him.
COL.1.17	He existed before anything else,
COL.1.17	and he holds all creation together.
COL.1.18	Christ is also the head of the church,
COL.1.18	which is his body.
COL.1.18	He is the beginning,
COL.1.18	supreme over all who rise from the dead.
COL.1.18	So he is first in everything.
COL.1.19	For God in all his fullness
COL.1.19	was pleased to live in Christ,
COL.1.20	and through him God reconciled
COL.1.20	everything to himself.
COL.1.20	He made peace with everything in heaven and on earth
COL.1.20	by means of Christ’s blood on the cross.
COL.1.21	This includes you who were once far away from God. You were his enemies, separated from him by your evil thoughts and actions. 
COL.1.22	Yet now he has reconciled you to himself through the death of Christ in his physical body. As a result, he has brought you into his own presence, and you are holy and blameless as you stand before him without a single fault.
COL.1.23	But you must continue to believe this truth and stand firmly in it. Don’t drift away from the assurance you received when you heard the Good News. The Good News has been preached all over the world, and I, Paul, have been appointed as God’s servant to proclaim it.
COL.1.24	I am glad when I suffer for you in my body, for I am participating in the sufferings of Christ that continue for his body, the church. 
COL.1.25	God has given me the responsibility of serving his church by proclaiming his entire message to you. 
COL.1.26	This message was kept secret for centuries and generations past, but now it has been revealed to God’s people. 
COL.1.27	For God wanted them to know that the riches and glory of Christ are for you Gentiles, too. And this is the secret: Christ lives in you. This gives you assurance of sharing his glory.
COL.1.28	So we tell others about Christ, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all the wisdom God has given us. We want to present them to God, perfect
COL.1.29	That’s why I work and struggle so hard, depending on Christ’s mighty power that works within me.
COL.2.1	I want you to know how much I have agonized for you and for the church at Laodicea, and for many other believers who have never met me personally. 
COL.2.2	I want them to be encouraged and knit together by strong ties of love. I want them to have complete confidence that they understand God’s mysterious plan, which is Christ himself. 
COL.2.3	In him lie hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
COL.2.4	I am telling you this so no one will deceive you with well-crafted arguments. 
COL.2.5	For though I am far away from you, my heart is with you. And I rejoice that you are living as you should and that your faith in Christ is strong.
COL.2.6	And now, just as you accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord, you must continue to follow him. 
COL.2.7	Let your roots grow down into him, and let your lives be built on him. Then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught, and you will overflow with thankfulness.
COL.2.8	Don’t let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense that come from human thinking and from the spiritual powers
COL.2.9	For in Christ lives all the fullness of God in a human body.
COL.2.10	So you also are complete through your union with Christ, who is the head over every ruler and authority.
COL.2.11	When you came to Christ, you were “circumcised,” but not by a physical procedure. Christ performed a spiritual circumcision—the cutting away of your sinful nature.
COL.2.12	For you were buried with Christ when you were baptized. And with him you were raised to new life because you trusted the mighty power of God, who raised Christ from the dead.
COL.2.13	You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away. Then God made you alive with Christ, for he forgave all our sins. 
COL.2.14	He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross. 
COL.2.15	In this way, he disarmed
COL.2.16	So don’t let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths. 
COL.2.17	For these rules are only shadows of the reality yet to come. And Christ himself is that reality. 
COL.2.18	Don’t let anyone condemn you by insisting on pious self-denial or the worship of angels,
COL.2.19	and they are not connected to Christ, the head of the body. For he holds the whole body together with its joints and ligaments, and it grows as God nourishes it.
COL.2.20	You have died with Christ, and he has set you free from the spiritual powers of this world. So why do you keep on following the rules of the world, such as, 
COL.2.21	“Don’t handle! Don’t taste! Don’t touch!”? 
COL.2.22	Such rules are mere human teachings about things that deteriorate as we use them. 
COL.2.23	These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion, pious self-denial, and severe bodily discipline. But they provide no help in conquering a person’s evil desires.
COL.3.1	Since you have been raised to new life with Christ, set your sights on the realities of heaven, where Christ sits in the place of honor at God’s right hand. 
COL.3.2	Think about the things of heaven, not the things of earth. 
COL.3.3	For you died to this life, and your real life is hidden with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	And when Christ, who is your
COL.3.5	So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires. Don’t be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world. 
COL.3.6	Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming.
COL.3.7	You used to do these things when your life was still part of this world. 
COL.3.8	But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behavior, slander, and dirty language. 
COL.3.9	Don’t lie to each other, for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its wicked deeds. 
COL.3.10	Put on your new nature, and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him. 
COL.3.11	In this new life, it doesn’t matter if you are a Jew or a Gentile,
COL.3.12	Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. 
COL.3.13	Make allowance for each other’s faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others. 
COL.3.14	Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony. 
COL.3.15	And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body you are called to live in peace. And always be thankful.
COL.3.16	Let the message about Christ, in all its richness, fill your lives. Teach and counsel each other with all the wisdom he gives. Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful hearts. 
COL.3.17	And whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through him to God the Father.
COL.3.18	Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting for those who belong to the Lord.
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives and never treat them harshly.
COL.3.20	Children, always obey your parents, for this pleases the Lord. 
COL.3.21	Fathers, do not aggravate your children, or they will become discouraged.
COL.3.22	Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything you do. Try to please them all the time, not just when they are watching you. Serve them sincerely because of your reverent fear of the Lord. 
COL.3.23	Work willingly at whatever you do, as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people. 
COL.3.24	Remember that the Lord will give you an inheritance as your reward, and that the Master you are serving is Christ.
COL.3.25	But if you do what is wrong, you will be paid back for the wrong you have done. For God has no favorites.
COL.4.1	Masters, be just and fair to your slaves. Remember that you also have a Master—in heaven.
COL.4.2	Devote yourselves to prayer with an alert mind and a thankful heart. 
COL.4.3	Pray for us, too, that God will give us many opportunities to speak about his mysterious plan concerning Christ. That is why I am here in chains. 
COL.4.4	Pray that I will proclaim this message as clearly as I should.
COL.4.5	Live wisely among those who are not believers, and make the most of every opportunity. 
COL.4.6	Let your conversation be gracious and attractive
COL.4.7	Tychicus will give you a full report about how I am getting along. He is a beloved brother and faithful helper who serves with me in the Lord’s work. 
COL.4.8	I have sent him to you for this very purpose—to let you know how we are doing and to encourage you. 
COL.4.9	I am also sending Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, one of your own people. He and Tychicus will tell you everything that’s happening here.
COL.4.10	Aristarchus, who is in prison with me, sends you his greetings, and so does Mark, Barnabas’s cousin. As you were instructed before, make Mark welcome if he comes your way. 
COL.4.11	Jesus (the one we call Justus) also sends his greetings. These are the only Jewish believers among my co-workers; they are working with me here for the Kingdom of God. And what a comfort they have been!
COL.4.12	Epaphras, a member of your own fellowship and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings. He always prays earnestly for you, asking God to make you strong and perfect, fully confident that you are following the whole will of God. 
COL.4.13	I can assure you that he prays hard for you and also for the believers in Laodicea and Hierapolis.
COL.4.14	Luke, the beloved doctor, sends his greetings, and so does Demas. 
COL.4.15	Please give my greetings to our brothers and sisters
COL.4.16	After you have read this letter, pass it on to the church at Laodicea so they can read it, too. And you should read the letter I wrote to them.
COL.4.17	And say to Archippus, “Be sure to carry out the ministry the Lord gave you.”
COL.4.18	.
COL.4.18	Remember my chains.
COL.4.18	May God’s grace be with you.
1TH.1.1	This letter is from Paul, Silas,
1TH.1.1	We are writing to the church in Thessalonica, to you who belong to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.1.1	May God give you grace and peace.
1TH.1.2	We always thank God for all of you and pray for you constantly. 
1TH.1.3	As we pray to our God and Father about you, we think of your faithful work, your loving deeds, and the enduring hope you have because of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.1.4	We know, dear brothers and sisters,
1TH.1.5	For when we brought you the Good News, it was not only with words but also with power, for the Holy Spirit gave you full assurance
1TH.1.6	So you received the message with joy from the Holy Spirit in spite of the severe suffering it brought you. In this way, you imitated both us and the Lord. 
1TH.1.7	As a result, you have become an example to all the believers in Greece—throughout both Macedonia and Achaia.
1TH.1.8	And now the word of the Lord is ringing out from you to people everywhere, even beyond Macedonia and Achaia, for wherever we go we find people telling us about your faith in God. We don’t need to tell them about it, 
1TH.1.9	for they keep talking about the wonderful welcome you gave us and how you turned away from idols to serve the living and true God. 
1TH.1.10	And they speak of how you are looking forward to the coming of God’s Son from heaven—Jesus, whom God raised from the dead. He is the one who has rescued us from the terrors of the coming judgment.
1TH.2.1	You yourselves know, dear brothers and sisters,
1TH.2.2	You know how badly we had been treated at Philippi just before we came to you and how much we suffered there. Yet our God gave us the courage to declare his Good News to you boldly, in spite of great opposition. 
1TH.2.3	So you can see we were not preaching with any deceit or impure motives or trickery.
1TH.2.4	For we speak as messengers approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News. Our purpose is to please God, not people. He alone examines the motives of our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	Never once did we try to win you with flattery, as you well know. And God is our witness that we were not pretending to be your friends just to get your money! 
1TH.2.6	As for human praise, we have never sought it from you or anyone else.
1TH.2.7	As apostles of Christ we certainly had a right to make some demands of you, but instead we were like children
1TH.2.8	We loved you so much that we shared with you not only God’s Good News but our own lives, too.
1TH.2.9	Don’t you remember, dear brothers and sisters, how hard we worked among you? Night and day we toiled to earn a living so that we would not be a burden to any of you as we preached God’s Good News to you. 
1TH.2.10	You yourselves are our witnesses—and so is God—that we were devout and honest and faultless toward all of you believers. 
1TH.2.11	And you know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children. 
1TH.2.12	We pleaded with you, encouraged you, and urged you to live your lives in a way that God would consider worthy. For he called you to share in his Kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.13	Therefore, we never stop thanking God that when you received his message from us, you didn’t think of our words as mere human ideas. You accepted what we said as the very word of God—which, of course, it is. And this word continues to work in you who believe.
1TH.2.14	And then, dear brothers and sisters, you suffered persecution from your own countrymen. In this way, you imitated the believers in God’s churches in Judea who, because of their belief in Christ Jesus, suffered from their own people, the Jews. 
1TH.2.15	For some of the Jews killed the prophets, and some even killed the Lord Jesus. Now they have persecuted us, too. They fail to please God and work against all humanity 
1TH.2.16	as they try to keep us from preaching the Good News of salvation to the Gentiles. By doing this, they continue to pile up their sins. But the anger of God has caught up with them at last.
1TH.2.17	Dear brothers and sisters, after we were separated from you for a little while (though our hearts never left you), we tried very hard to come back because of our intense longing to see you again. 
1TH.2.18	We wanted very much to come to you, and I, Paul, tried again and again, but Satan prevented us. 
1TH.2.19	After all, what gives us hope and joy, and what will be our proud reward and crown as we stand before our Lord Jesus when he returns? It is you! 
1TH.2.20	Yes, you are our pride and joy.
1TH.3.1	Finally, when we could stand it no longer, we decided to stay alone in Athens, 
1TH.3.2	and we sent Timothy to visit you. He is our brother and God’s co-worker
1TH.3.3	and to keep you from being shaken by the troubles you were going through. But you know that we are destined for such troubles. 
1TH.3.4	Even while we were with you, we warned you that troubles would soon come—and they did, as you well know. 
1TH.3.5	That is why, when I could bear it no longer, I sent Timothy to find out whether your faith was still strong. I was afraid that the tempter had gotten the best of you and that our work had been useless.
1TH.3.6	But now Timothy has just returned, bringing us good news about your faith and love. He reports that you always remember our visit with joy and that you want to see us as much as we want to see you. 
1TH.3.7	So we have been greatly encouraged in the midst of our troubles and suffering, dear brothers and sisters,
1TH.3.8	It gives us new life to know that you are standing firm in the Lord.
1TH.3.9	How we thank God for you! Because of you we have great joy as we enter God’s presence. 
1TH.3.10	Night and day we pray earnestly for you, asking God to let us see you again to fill the gaps in your faith.
1TH.3.11	May God our Father and our Lord Jesus bring us to you very soon. 
1TH.3.12	And may the Lord make your love for one another and for all people grow and overflow, just as our love for you overflows. 
1TH.3.13	May he, as a result, make your hearts strong, blameless, and holy as you stand before God our Father when our Lord Jesus comes again with all his holy people. Amen.
1TH.4.1	Finally, dear brothers and sisters,
1TH.4.2	For you remember what we taught you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
1TH.4.3	God’s will is for you to be holy, so stay away from all sexual sin. 
1TH.4.4	Then each of you will control his own body
1TH.4.5	not in lustful passion like the pagans who do not know God and his ways. 
1TH.4.6	Never harm or cheat a fellow believer in this matter by violating his wife,
1TH.4.7	God has called us to live holy lives, not impure lives. 
1TH.4.8	Therefore, anyone who refuses to live by these rules is not disobeying human teaching but is rejecting God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
1TH.4.9	But we don’t need to write to you about the importance of loving each other,
1TH.4.10	Indeed, you already show your love for all the believers
1TH.4.11	Make it your goal to live a quiet life, minding your own business and working with your hands, just as we instructed you before. 
1TH.4.12	Then people who are not believers will respect the way you live, and you will not need to depend on others.
1TH.4.13	And now, dear brothers and sisters, we want you to know what will happen to the believers who have died
1TH.4.14	For since we believe that Jesus died and was raised to life again, we also believe that when Jesus returns, God will bring back with him the believers who have died.
1TH.4.15	We tell you this directly from the Lord: We who are still living when the Lord returns will not meet him ahead of those who have died.
1TH.4.16	For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. First, the believers who have died
1TH.4.17	Then, together with them, we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Then we will be with the Lord forever. 
1TH.4.18	So encourage each other with these words.
1TH.5.1	Now concerning how and when all this will happen, dear brothers and sisters,
1TH.5.2	For you know quite well that the day of the Lord’s return will come unexpectedly, like a thief in the night. 
1TH.5.3	When people are saying, “Everything is peaceful and secure,” then disaster will fall on them as suddenly as a pregnant woman’s labor pains begin. And there will be no escape.
1TH.5.4	But you aren’t in the dark about these things, dear brothers and sisters, and you won’t be surprised when the day of the Lord comes like a thief.
1TH.5.5	For you are all children of the light and of the day; we don’t belong to darkness and night. 
1TH.5.6	So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be clearheaded. 
1TH.5.7	Night is the time when people sleep and drinkers get drunk. 
1TH.5.8	But let us who live in the light be clearheaded, protected by the armor of faith and love, and wearing as our helmet the confidence of our salvation.
1TH.5.9	For God chose to save us through our Lord Jesus Christ, not to pour out his anger on us. 
1TH.5.10	Christ died for us so that, whether we are dead or alive when he returns, we can live with him forever. 
1TH.5.11	So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.
1TH.5.12	Dear brothers and sisters, honor those who are your leaders in the Lord’s work. They work hard among you and give you spiritual guidance. 
1TH.5.13	Show them great respect and wholehearted love because of their work. And live peacefully with each other.
1TH.5.14	Brothers and sisters, we urge you to warn those who are lazy. Encourage those who are timid. Take tender care of those who are weak. Be patient with everyone.
1TH.5.15	See that no one pays back evil for evil, but always try to do good to each other and to all people.
1TH.5.16	Always be joyful. 
1TH.5.17	Never stop praying. 
1TH.5.18	Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.
1TH.5.19	Do not stifle the Holy Spirit. 
1TH.5.20	Do not scoff at prophecies, 
1TH.5.21	but test everything that is said. Hold on to what is good. 
1TH.5.22	Stay away from every kind of evil.
1TH.5.23	Now may the God of peace make you holy in every way, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again. 
1TH.5.24	God will make this happen, for he who calls you is faithful.
1TH.5.25	Dear brothers and sisters, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	Greet all the brothers and sisters with a sacred kiss.
1TH.5.27	I command you in the name of the Lord to read this letter to all the brothers and sisters.
1TH.5.28	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2TH.1.1	This letter is from Paul, Silas,
2TH.1.1	We are writing to the church in Thessalonica, to you who belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.2	May God our Father
2TH.1.3	Dear brothers and sisters,
2TH.1.4	We proudly tell God’s other churches about your endurance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and hardships you are suffering. 
2TH.1.5	And God will use this persecution to show his justice and to make you worthy of his Kingdom, for which you are suffering. 
2TH.1.6	In his justice he will pay back those who persecute you.
2TH.1.7	And God will provide rest for you who are being persecuted and also for us when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven. He will come with his mighty angels, 
2TH.1.8	in flaming fire, bringing judgment on those who don’t know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus. 
2TH.1.9	They will be punished with eternal destruction, forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power. 
2TH.1.10	When he comes on that day, he will receive glory from his holy people—praise from all who believe. And this includes you, for you believed what we told you about him.
2TH.1.11	So we keep on praying for you, asking our God to enable you to live a life worthy of his call. May he give you the power to accomplish all the good things your faith prompts you to do. 
2TH.1.12	Then the name of our Lord Jesus will be honored because of the way you live, and you will be honored along with him. This is all made possible because of the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.1	Now, dear brothers and sisters,
2TH.2.2	Don’t be so easily shaken or alarmed by those who say that the day of the Lord has already begun. Don’t believe them, even if they claim to have had a spiritual vision, a revelation, or a letter supposedly from us. 
2TH.2.3	Don’t be fooled by what they say. For that day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of lawlessness
2TH.2.4	He will exalt himself and defy everything that people call god and every object of worship. He will even sit in the temple of God, claiming that he himself is God.
2TH.2.5	Don’t you remember that I told you about all this when I was with you? 
2TH.2.6	And you know what is holding him back, for he can be revealed only when his time comes. 
2TH.2.7	For this lawlessness is already at work secretly, and it will remain secret until the one who is holding it back steps out of the way. 
2TH.2.8	Then the man of lawlessness will be revealed, but the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth and destroy him by the splendor of his coming.
2TH.2.9	This man will come to do the work of Satan with counterfeit power and signs and miracles. 
2TH.2.10	He will use every kind of evil deception to fool those on their way to destruction, because they refuse to love and accept the truth that would save them. 
2TH.2.11	So God will cause them to be greatly deceived, and they will believe these lies. 
2TH.2.12	Then they will be condemned for enjoying evil rather than believing the truth.
2TH.2.13	As for us, we can’t help but thank God for you, dear brothers and sisters loved by the Lord. We are always thankful that God chose you to be among the first
2TH.2.14	He called you to salvation when we told you the Good News; now you can share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.15	With all these things in mind, dear brothers and sisters, stand firm and keep a strong grip on the teaching we passed on to you both in person and by letter.
2TH.2.16	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal comfort and a wonderful hope, 
2TH.2.17	comfort you and strengthen you in every good thing you do and say.
2TH.3.1	Finally, dear brothers and sisters,
2TH.3.2	Pray, too, that we will be rescued from wicked and evil people, for not everyone is a believer. 
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.
2TH.3.4	And we are confident in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we commanded you. 
2TH.3.5	May the Lord lead your hearts into a full understanding and expression of the love of God and the patient endurance that comes from Christ.
2TH.3.6	And now, dear brothers and sisters, we give you this command in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ: Stay away from all believers
2TH.3.7	For you know that you ought to imitate us. We were not idle when we were with you. 
2TH.3.8	We never accepted food from anyone without paying for it. We worked hard day and night so we would not be a burden to any of you. 
2TH.3.9	We certainly had the right to ask you to feed us, but we wanted to give you an example to follow. 
2TH.3.10	Even while we were with you, we gave you this command: “Those unwilling to work will not get to eat.”
2TH.3.11	Yet we hear that some of you are living idle lives, refusing to work and meddling in other people’s business. 
2TH.3.12	We command such people and urge them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and work to earn their own living. 
2TH.3.13	As for the rest of you, dear brothers and sisters, never get tired of doing good.
2TH.3.14	Take note of those who refuse to obey what we say in this letter. Stay away from them so they will be ashamed. 
2TH.3.15	Don’t think of them as enemies, but warn them as you would a brother or sister.
2TH.3.16	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you his peace at all times and in every situation. The Lord be with you all.
2TH.3.18	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
1TI.1.1	This letter is from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, appointed by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus, who gives us hope.
1TI.1.2	I am writing to Timothy, my true son in the faith.
1TI.1.2	May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace, mercy, and peace.
1TI.1.3	When I left for Macedonia, I urged you to stay there in Ephesus and stop those whose teaching is contrary to the truth. 
1TI.1.4	Don’t let them waste their time in endless discussion of myths and spiritual pedigrees. These things only lead to meaningless speculations,
1TI.1.5	The purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith. 
1TI.1.6	But some people have missed this whole point. They have turned away from these things and spend their time in meaningless discussions. 
1TI.1.7	They want to be known as teachers of the law of Moses, but they don’t know what they are talking about, even though they speak so confidently.
1TI.1.8	We know that the law is good when used correctly. 
1TI.1.9	For the law was not intended for people who do what is right. It is for people who are lawless and rebellious, who are ungodly and sinful, who consider nothing sacred and defile what is holy, who kill their father or mother or commit other murders. 
1TI.1.10	The law is for people who are sexually immoral, or who practice homosexuality, or are slave traders,
1TI.1.11	that comes from the glorious Good News entrusted to me by our blessed God.
1TI.1.12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength to do his work. He considered me trustworthy and appointed me to serve him, 
1TI.1.13	even though I used to blaspheme the name of Christ. In my insolence, I persecuted his people. But God had mercy on me because I did it in ignorance and unbelief. 
1TI.1.14	Oh, how generous and gracious our Lord was! He filled me with the faith and love that come from Christ Jesus.
1TI.1.15	This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners”—and I am the worst of them all. 
1TI.1.16	But God had mercy on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example of his great patience with even the worst sinners. Then others will realize that they, too, can believe in him and receive eternal life. 
1TI.1.17	All honor and glory to God forever and ever! He is the eternal King, the unseen one who never dies; he alone is God. Amen.
1TI.1.18	Timothy, my son, here are my instructions for you, based on the prophetic words spoken about you earlier. May they help you fight well in the Lord’s battles. 
1TI.1.19	Cling to your faith in Christ, and keep your conscience clear. For some people have deliberately violated their consciences; as a result, their faith has been shipwrecked. 
1TI.1.20	Hymenaeus and Alexander are two examples. I threw them out and handed them over to Satan so they might learn not to blaspheme God.
1TI.2.1	I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them. 
1TI.2.2	Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. 
1TI.2.3	This is good and pleases God our Savior, 
1TI.2.4	who wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth. 
1TI.2.5	For,
1TI.2.5	There is one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity—the man Christ Jesus. 
1TI.2.6	He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone.
1TI.2.6	This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time. 
1TI.2.7	And I have been chosen as a preacher and apostle to teach the Gentiles this message about faith and truth. I’m not exaggerating—just telling the truth.
1TI.2.8	In every place of worship, I want men to pray with holy hands lifted up to God, free from anger and controversy.
1TI.2.9	And I want women to be modest in their appearance.
1TI.2.10	For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do.
1TI.2.11	Women should learn quietly and submissively. 
1TI.2.12	I do not let women teach men or have authority over them.
1TI.2.13	For God made Adam first, and afterward he made Eve. 
1TI.2.14	And it was not Adam who was deceived by Satan. The woman was deceived, and sin was the result. 
1TI.2.15	But women will be saved through childbearing,
1TI.3.1	This is a trustworthy saying: “If someone aspires to be a church leader,
1TI.3.2	So a church leader must be a man whose life is above reproach. He must be faithful to his wife.
1TI.3.3	He must not be a heavy drinker
1TI.3.4	He must manage his own family well, having children who respect and obey him. 
1TI.3.5	For if a man cannot manage his own household, how can he take care of God’s church?
1TI.3.6	A church leader must not be a new believer, because he might become proud, and the devil would cause him to fall.
1TI.3.7	Also, people outside the church must speak well of him so that he will not be disgraced and fall into the devil’s trap.
1TI.3.8	In the same way, deacons must be well respected and have integrity. They must not be heavy drinkers or dishonest with money. 
1TI.3.9	They must be committed to the mystery of the faith now revealed and must live with a clear conscience. 
1TI.3.10	Before they are appointed as deacons, let them be closely examined. If they pass the test, then let them serve as deacons.
1TI.3.11	In the same way, their wives
1TI.3.12	A deacon must be faithful to his wife, and he must manage his children and household well. 
1TI.3.13	Those who do well as deacons will be rewarded with respect from others and will have increased confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	I am writing these things to you now, even though I hope to be with you soon, 
1TI.3.15	so that if I am delayed, you will know how people must conduct themselves in the household of God. This is the church of the living God, which is the pillar and foundation of the truth.
1TI.3.16	Without question, this is the great mystery of our faith
1TI.3.16	Christ
1TI.3.16	and vindicated by the Spirit.
1TI.3.16	He was seen by angels
1TI.3.16	and announced to the nations.
1TI.3.16	He was believed in throughout the world
1TI.3.16	and taken to heaven in glory.
1TI.4.1	Now the Holy Spirit tells us clearly that in the last times some will turn away from the true faith; they will follow deceptive spirits and teachings that come from demons. 
1TI.4.2	These people are hypocrites and liars, and their consciences are dead.
1TI.4.3	They will say it is wrong to be married and wrong to eat certain foods. But God created those foods to be eaten with thanks by faithful people who know the truth. 
1TI.4.4	Since everything God created is good, we should not reject any of it but receive it with thanks. 
1TI.4.5	For we know it is made acceptable
1TI.4.6	If you explain these things to the brothers and sisters,
1TI.4.7	Do not waste time arguing over godless ideas and old wives’ tales. Instead, train yourself to be godly. 
1TI.4.8	“Physical training is good, but training for godliness is much better, promising benefits in this life and in the life to come.” 
1TI.4.9	This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it. 
1TI.4.10	This is why we work hard and continue to struggle,
1TI.4.11	Teach these things and insist that everyone learn them. 
1TI.4.12	Don’t let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity. 
1TI.4.13	Until I get there, focus on reading the Scriptures to the church, encouraging the believers, and teaching them.
1TI.4.14	Do not neglect the spiritual gift you received through the prophecy spoken over you when the elders of the church laid their hands on you. 
1TI.4.15	Give your complete attention to these matters. Throw yourself into your tasks so that everyone will see your progress. 
1TI.4.16	Keep a close watch on how you live and on your teaching. Stay true to what is right for the sake of your own salvation and the salvation of those who hear you.
1TI.5.1	Never speak harshly to an older man,
1TI.5.2	Treat older women as you would your mother, and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters.
1TI.5.3	Take care of
1TI.5.4	But if she has children or grandchildren, their first responsibility is to show godliness at home and repay their parents by taking care of them. This is something that pleases God.
1TI.5.5	Now a true widow, a woman who is truly alone in this world, has placed her hope in God. She prays night and day, asking God for his help. 
1TI.5.6	But the widow who lives only for pleasure is spiritually dead even while she lives. 
1TI.5.7	Give these instructions to the church so that no one will be open to criticism.
1TI.5.8	But those who won’t care for their relatives, especially those in their own household, have denied the true faith. Such people are worse than unbelievers.
1TI.5.9	A widow who is put on the list for support must be a woman who is at least sixty years old and was faithful to her husband.
1TI.5.10	She must be well respected by everyone because of the good she has done. Has she brought up her children well? Has she been kind to strangers and served other believers humbly?
1TI.5.11	The younger widows should not be on the list, because their physical desires will overpower their devotion to Christ and they will want to remarry. 
1TI.5.12	Then they would be guilty of breaking their previous pledge. 
1TI.5.13	And if they are on the list, they will learn to be lazy and will spend their time gossiping from house to house, meddling in other people’s business and talking about things they shouldn’t. 
1TI.5.14	So I advise these younger widows to marry again, have children, and take care of their own homes. Then the enemy will not be able to say anything against them. 
1TI.5.15	For I am afraid that some of them have already gone astray and now follow Satan.
1TI.5.16	If a woman who is a believer has relatives who are widows, she must take care of them and not put the responsibility on the church. Then the church can care for the widows who are truly alone.
1TI.5.17	Elders who do their work well should be respected and paid well,
1TI.5.18	For the Scripture says, “You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain.” And in another place, 
1TI.5.19	Do not listen to an accusation against an elder unless it is confirmed by two or three witnesses. 
1TI.5.20	Those who sin should be reprimanded in front of the whole church; this will serve as a strong warning to others.
1TI.5.21	I solemnly command you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus and the highest angels to obey these instructions without taking sides or showing favoritism to anyone.
1TI.5.22	Never be in a hurry about appointing a church leader.
1TI.5.23	Don’t drink only water. You ought to drink a little wine for the sake of your stomach because you are sick so often.
1TI.5.24	Remember, the sins of some people are obvious, leading them to certain judgment. But there are others whose sins will not be revealed until later. 
1TI.5.25	In the same way, the good deeds of some people are obvious. And the good deeds done in secret will someday come to light.
1TI.6.1	All slaves should show full respect for their masters so they will not bring shame on the name of God and his teaching. 
1TI.6.2	If the masters are believers, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. Those slaves should work all the harder because their efforts are helping other believers
1TI.6.2	Teach these things, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them. 
1TI.6.3	Some people may contradict our teaching, but these are the wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. These teachings promote a godly life. 
1TI.6.4	Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding. Such a person has an unhealthy desire to quibble over the meaning of words. This stirs up arguments ending in jealousy, division, slander, and evil suspicions. 
1TI.6.5	These people always cause trouble. Their minds are corrupt, and they have turned their backs on the truth. To them, a show of godliness is just a way to become wealthy.
1TI.6.6	Yet true godliness with contentment is itself great wealth. 
1TI.6.7	After all, we brought nothing with us when we came into the world, and we can’t take anything with us when we leave it. 
1TI.6.8	So if we have enough food and clothing, let us be content.
1TI.6.9	But people who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction. 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. And some people, craving money, have wandered from the true faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.
1TI.6.11	But you, Timothy, are a man of God; so run from all these evil things. Pursue righteousness and a godly life, along with faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness. 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight for the true faith. Hold tightly to the eternal life to which God has called you, which you have declared so well before many witnesses. 
1TI.6.13	And I charge you before God, who gives life to all, and before Christ Jesus, who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate, 
1TI.6.14	that you obey this command without wavering. Then no one can find fault with you from now until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again. 
1TI.6.15	For,
1TI.6.15	At just the right time Christ will be revealed from heaven by the blessed and only almighty God, the King of all kings and Lord of all lords. 
1TI.6.16	He alone can never die, and he lives in light so brilliant that no human can approach him. No human eye has ever seen him, nor ever will. All honor and power to him forever! Amen.
1TI.6.17	Teach those who are rich in this world not to be proud and not to trust in their money, which is so unreliable. Their trust should be in God, who richly gives us all we need for our enjoyment. 
1TI.6.18	Tell them to use their money to do good. They should be rich in good works and generous to those in need, always being ready to share with others. 
1TI.6.19	By doing this they will be storing up their treasure as a good foundation for the future so that they may experience true life.
1TI.6.20	Timothy, guard what God has entrusted to you. Avoid godless, foolish discussions with those who oppose you with their so-called knowledge. 
1TI.6.21	Some people have wandered from the faith by following such foolishness.
1TI.6.21	May God’s grace be with you all.
2TI.1.1	This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. I have been sent out to tell others about the life he has promised through faith in Christ Jesus.
2TI.1.2	I am writing to Timothy, my dear son.
2TI.1.2	May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace, mercy, and peace.
2TI.1.3	Timothy, I thank God for you—the God I serve with a clear conscience, just as my ancestors did. Night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. 
2TI.1.4	I long to see you again, for I remember your tears as we parted. And I will be filled with joy when we are together again.
2TI.1.5	I remember your genuine faith, for you share the faith that first filled your grandmother Lois and your mother, Eunice. And I know that same faith continues strong in you. 
2TI.1.6	This is why I remind you to fan into flames the spiritual gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you. 
2TI.1.7	For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.
2TI.1.8	So never be ashamed to tell others about our Lord. And don’t be ashamed of me, either, even though I’m in prison for him. With the strength God gives you, be ready to suffer with me for the sake of the Good News. 
2TI.1.9	For God saved us and called us to live a holy life. He did this, not because we deserved it, but because that was his plan from before the beginning of time—to show us his grace through Christ Jesus. 
2TI.1.10	And now he has made all of this plain to us by the appearing of Christ Jesus, our Savior. He broke the power of death and illuminated the way to life and immortality through the Good News. 
2TI.1.11	And God chose me to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of this Good News.
2TI.1.12	That is why I am suffering here in prison. But I am not ashamed of it, for I know the one in whom I trust, and I am sure that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him
2TI.1.13	Hold on to the pattern of wholesome teaching you learned from me—a pattern shaped by the faith and love that you have in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.1.14	Through the power of the Holy Spirit who lives within us, carefully guard the precious truth that has been entrusted to you.
2TI.1.15	As you know, everyone from the province of Asia has deserted me—even Phygelus and Hermogenes.
2TI.1.16	May the Lord show special kindness to Onesiphorus and all his family because he often visited and encouraged me. He was never ashamed of me because I was in chains. 
2TI.1.17	When he came to Rome, he searched everywhere until he found me. 
2TI.1.18	May the Lord show him special kindness on the day of Christ’s return. And you know very well how helpful he was in Ephesus.
2TI.2.1	Timothy, my dear son, be strong through the grace that God gives you in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.2	You have heard me teach things that have been confirmed by many reliable witnesses. Now teach these truths to other trustworthy people who will be able to pass them on to others.
2TI.2.3	Endure suffering along with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.4	Soldiers don’t get tied up in the affairs of civilian life, for then they cannot please the officer who enlisted them. 
2TI.2.5	And athletes cannot win the prize unless they follow the rules. 
2TI.2.6	And hardworking farmers should be the first to enjoy the fruit of their labor. 
2TI.2.7	Think about what I am saying. The Lord will help you understand all these things.
2TI.2.8	Always remember that Jesus Christ, a descendant of King David, was raised from the dead. This is the Good News I preach. 
2TI.2.9	And because I preach this Good News, I am suffering and have been chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be chained. 
2TI.2.10	So I am willing to endure anything if it will bring salvation and eternal glory in Christ Jesus to those God has chosen.
2TI.2.11	This is a trustworthy saying:
2TI.2.11	If we die with him,
2TI.2.11	we will also live with him.
2TI.2.12	If we endure hardship,
2TI.2.12	we will reign with him.
2TI.2.12	If we deny him,
2TI.2.12	he will deny us.
2TI.2.13	If we are unfaithful,
2TI.2.13	he remains faithful,
2TI.2.13	for he cannot deny who he is.
2TI.2.14	Remind everyone about these things, and command them in God’s presence to stop fighting over words. Such arguments are useless, and they can ruin those who hear them.
2TI.2.15	Work hard so you can present yourself to God and receive his approval. Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly explains the word of truth. 
2TI.2.16	Avoid worthless, foolish talk that only leads to more godless behavior. 
2TI.2.17	This kind of talk spreads like cancer,
2TI.2.18	They have left the path of truth, claiming that the resurrection of the dead has already occurred; in this way, they have turned some people away from the faith.
2TI.2.19	But God’s truth stands firm like a foundation stone with this inscription: “The 
2TI.2.20	In a wealthy home some utensils are made of gold and silver, and some are made of wood and clay. The expensive utensils are used for special occasions, and the cheap ones are for everyday use. 
2TI.2.21	If you keep yourself pure, you will be a special utensil for honorable use. Your life will be clean, and you will be ready for the Master to use you for every good work.
2TI.2.22	Run from anything that stimulates youthful lusts. Instead, pursue righteous living, faithfulness, love, and peace. Enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with pure hearts.
2TI.2.23	Again I say, don’t get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights. 
2TI.2.24	A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people. 
2TI.2.25	Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people’s hearts, and they will learn the truth. 
2TI.2.26	Then they will come to their senses and escape from the devil’s trap. For they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants.
2TI.3.1	You should know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times. 
2TI.3.2	For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred. 
2TI.3.3	They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good. 
2TI.3.4	They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God. 
2TI.3.5	They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that!
2TI.3.6	They are the kind who work their way into people’s homes and win the confidence of
2TI.3.7	(Such women are forever following new teachings, but they are never able to understand the truth.) 
2TI.3.8	These teachers oppose the truth just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses. They have depraved minds and a counterfeit faith. 
2TI.3.9	But they won’t get away with this for long. Someday everyone will recognize what fools they are, just as with Jannes and Jambres.
2TI.3.10	But you, Timothy, certainly know what I teach, and how I live, and what my purpose in life is. You know my faith, my patience, my love, and my endurance. 
2TI.3.11	You know how much persecution and suffering I have endured. You know all about how I was persecuted in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra—but the Lord rescued me from all of it. 
2TI.3.12	Yes, and everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 
2TI.3.13	But evil people and impostors will flourish. They will deceive others and will themselves be deceived.
2TI.3.14	But you must remain faithful to the things you have been taught. You know they are true, for you know you can trust those who taught you. 
2TI.3.15	You have been taught the holy Scriptures from childhood, and they have given you the wisdom to receive the salvation that comes by trusting in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right. 
2TI.3.17	God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work.
2TI.4.1	I solemnly urge you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus, who will someday judge the living and the dead when he comes to set up his Kingdom: 
2TI.4.2	Preach the word of God. Be prepared, whether the time is favorable or not. Patiently correct, rebuke, and encourage your people with good teaching.
2TI.4.3	For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching. They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear. 
2TI.4.4	They will reject the truth and chase after myths.
2TI.4.5	But you should keep a clear mind in every situation. Don’t be afraid of suffering for the Lord. Work at telling others the Good News, and fully carry out the ministry God has given you.
2TI.4.6	As for me, my life has already been poured out as an offering to God. The time of my death is near. 
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, and I have remained faithful. 
2TI.4.8	And now the prize awaits me—the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on the day of his return. And the prize is not just for me but for all who eagerly look forward to his appearing.
2TI.4.9	Timothy, please come as soon as you can. 
2TI.4.10	Demas has deserted me because he loves the things of this life and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus has gone to Dalmatia. 
2TI.4.11	Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark with you when you come, for he will be helpful to me in my ministry. 
2TI.4.12	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 
2TI.4.13	When you come, be sure to bring the coat I left with Carpus at Troas. Also bring my books, and especially my papers.
2TI.4.14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm, but the Lord will judge him for what he has done. 
2TI.4.15	Be careful of him, for he fought against everything we said.
2TI.4.16	The first time I was brought before the judge, no one came with me. Everyone abandoned me. May it not be counted against them. 
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stood with me and gave me strength so that I might preach the Good News in its entirety for all the Gentiles to hear. And he rescued me from certain death.
2TI.4.18	Yes, and the Lord will deliver me from every evil attack and will bring me safely into his heavenly Kingdom. All glory to God forever and ever! Amen.
2TI.4.19	Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and those living in the household of Onesiphorus. 
2TI.4.20	Erastus stayed at Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.
2TI.4.21	Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters.
2TI.4.22	May the Lord be with your spirit. And may his grace be with all of you.
TIT.1.1	This letter is from Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I have been sent to proclaim faith to
TIT.1.2	This truth gives them confidence that they have eternal life, which God—who does not lie—promised them before the world began. 
TIT.1.3	And now at just the right time he has revealed this message, which we announce to everyone. It is by the command of God our Savior that I have been entrusted with this work for him.
TIT.1.4	I am writing to Titus, my true son in the faith that we share.
TIT.1.4	May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace.
TIT.1.5	I left you on the island of Crete so you could complete our work there and appoint elders in each town as I instructed you. 
TIT.1.6	An elder must live a blameless life. He must be faithful to his wife,
TIT.1.7	A church leader
TIT.1.8	Rather, he must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must love what is good. He must live wisely and be just. He must live a devout and disciplined life. 
TIT.1.9	He must have a strong belief in the trustworthy message he was taught; then he will be able to encourage others with wholesome teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong.
TIT.1.10	For there are many rebellious people who engage in useless talk and deceive others. This is especially true of those who insist on circumcision for salvation. 
TIT.1.11	They must be silenced, because they are turning whole families away from the truth by their false teaching. And they do it only for money. 
TIT.1.12	Even one of their own men, a prophet from Crete, has said about them, “The people of Crete are all liars, cruel animals, and lazy gluttons.”
TIT.1.13	This is true. So reprimand them sternly to make them strong in the faith. 
TIT.1.14	They must stop listening to Jewish myths and the commands of people who have turned away from the truth.
TIT.1.15	Everything is pure to those whose hearts are pure. But nothing is pure to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, because their minds and consciences are corrupted. 
TIT.1.16	Such people claim they know God, but they deny him by the way they live. They are detestable and disobedient, worthless for doing anything good.
TIT.2.1	As for you, Titus, promote the kind of living that reflects wholesome teaching. 
TIT.2.2	Teach the older men to exercise self-control, to be worthy of respect, and to live wisely. They must have sound faith and be filled with love and patience.
TIT.2.3	Similarly, teach the older women to live in a way that honors God. They must not slander others or be heavy drinkers.
TIT.2.4	These older women must train the younger women to love their husbands and their children, 
TIT.2.5	to live wisely and be pure, to work in their homes,
TIT.2.6	In the same way, encourage the young men to live wisely. 
TIT.2.7	And you yourself must be an example to them by doing good works of every kind. Let everything you do reflect the integrity and seriousness of your teaching. 
TIT.2.8	Teach the truth so that your teaching can’t be criticized. Then those who oppose us will be ashamed and have nothing bad to say about us.
TIT.2.9	Slaves must always obey their masters and do their best to please them. They must not talk back 
TIT.2.10	or steal, but must show themselves to be entirely trustworthy and good. Then they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive in every way.
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all people. 
TIT.2.12	And we are instructed to turn from godless living and sinful pleasures. We should live in this evil world with wisdom, righteousness, and devotion to God, 
TIT.2.13	while we look forward with hope to that wonderful day when the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, will be revealed. 
TIT.2.14	He gave his life to free us from every kind of sin, to cleanse us, and to make us his very own people, totally committed to doing good deeds.
TIT.2.15	You must teach these things and encourage the believers to do them. You have the authority to correct them when necessary, so don’t let anyone disregard what you say.
TIT.3.1	Remind the believers to submit to the government and its officers. They should be obedient, always ready to do what is good. 
TIT.3.2	They must not slander anyone and must avoid quarreling. Instead, they should be gentle and show true humility to everyone.
TIT.3.3	Once we, too, were foolish and disobedient. We were misled and became slaves to many lusts and pleasures. Our lives were full of evil and envy, and we hated each other. 
TIT.3.4	But—
TIT.3.4	When God our Savior revealed his kindness and love, 
TIT.3.5	he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit.
TIT.3.6	He generously poured out the Spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior. 
TIT.3.7	Because of his grace he made us right in his sight and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life.
TIT.3.8	This is a trustworthy saying, and I want you to insist on these teachings so that all who trust in God will devote themselves to doing good. These teachings are good and beneficial for everyone.
TIT.3.9	Do not get involved in foolish discussions about spiritual pedigrees
TIT.3.10	If people are causing divisions among you, give a first and second warning. After that, have nothing more to do with them. 
TIT.3.11	For people like that have turned away from the truth, and their own sins condemn them.
TIT.3.12	I am planning to send either Artemas or Tychicus to you. As soon as one of them arrives, do your best to meet me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to stay there for the winter. 
TIT.3.13	Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos with their trip. See that they are given everything they need. 
TIT.3.14	Our people must learn to do good by meeting the urgent needs of others; then they will not be unproductive.
TIT.3.15	Everybody here sends greetings. Please give my greetings to the believers—all who love us.
TIT.3.15	May God’s grace be with you all.
PHM.1.1	This letter is from Paul, a prisoner for preaching the Good News about Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy.
PHM.1.1	I am writing to Philemon, our beloved co-worker, 
PHM.1.2	and to our sister Apphia, and to our fellow soldier Archippus, and to the church that meets in your
PHM.1.3	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
PHM.1.4	I always thank my God when I pray for you, Philemon, 
PHM.1.5	because I keep hearing about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God’s people. 
PHM.1.6	And I am praying that you will put into action the generosity that comes from your faith as you understand and experience all the good things we have in Christ. 
PHM.1.7	Your love has given me much joy and comfort, my brother, for your kindness has often refreshed the hearts of God’s people.
PHM.1.8	That is why I am boldly asking a favor of you. I could demand it in the name of Christ because it is the right thing for you to do. 
PHM.1.9	But because of our love, I prefer simply to ask you. Consider this as a request from me—Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus.
PHM.1.10	I appeal to you to show kindness to my child, Onesimus. I became his father in the faith while here in prison. 
PHM.1.11	Onesimus
PHM.1.12	I am sending him back to you, and with him comes my own heart.
PHM.1.13	I wanted to keep him here with me while I am in these chains for preaching the Good News, and he would have helped me on your behalf. 
PHM.1.14	But I didn’t want to do anything without your consent. I wanted you to help because you were willing, not because you were forced. 
PHM.1.15	It seems you lost Onesimus for a little while so that you could have him back forever. 
PHM.1.16	He is no longer like a slave to you. He is more than a slave, for he is a beloved brother, especially to me. Now he will mean much more to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.
PHM.1.17	So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. 
PHM.1.18	If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to me. 
PHM.1.19	!
PHM.1.20	Yes, my brother, please do me this favor
PHM.1.21	I am confident as I write this letter that you will do what I ask and even more! 
PHM.1.22	One more thing—please prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that God will answer your prayers and let me return to you soon.
PHM.1.23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings. 
PHM.1.24	So do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my co-workers.
PHM.1.25	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
HEB.1.1	Long ago God spoke many times and in many ways to our ancestors through the prophets. 
HEB.1.2	And now in these final days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God promised everything to the Son as an inheritance, and through the Son he created the universe. 
HEB.1.3	The Son radiates God’s own glory and expresses the very character of God, and he sustains everything by the mighty power of his command. When he had cleansed us from our sins, he sat down in the place of honor at the right hand of the majestic God in heaven. 
HEB.1.4	This shows that the Son is far greater than the angels, just as the name God gave him is greater than their names.
HEB.1.5	For God never said to any angel what he said to Jesus:
HEB.1.5	“You are my Son.
HEB.1.5	Today I have become your Father.
HEB.1.5	God also said,
HEB.1.5	“I will be his Father,
HEB.1.5	and he will be my Son.”
HEB.1.6	And when he brought his supreme
HEB.1.6	“Let all of God’s angels worship him.”
HEB.1.7	Regarding the angels, he says,
HEB.1.7	“He sends his angels like the winds,
HEB.1.7	his servants like flames of fire.”
HEB.1.8	But to the Son he says,
HEB.1.8	“Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever.
HEB.1.8	You rule with a scepter of justice.
HEB.1.9	You love justice and hate evil.
HEB.1.9	Therefore, O God, your God has anointed you,
HEB.1.9	pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.”
HEB.1.10	He also says to the Son,
HEB.1.10	“In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundation of the earth
HEB.1.10	and made the heavens with your hands.
HEB.1.11	They will perish, but you remain forever.
HEB.1.11	They will wear out like old clothing.
HEB.1.12	You will fold them up like a cloak
HEB.1.12	and discard them like old clothing.
HEB.1.12	But you are always the same;
HEB.1.12	you will live forever.”
HEB.1.13	And God never said to any of the angels,
HEB.1.13	“Sit in the place of honor at my right hand
HEB.1.13	until I humble your enemies,
HEB.1.13	making them a footstool under your feet.”
HEB.1.14	Therefore, angels are only servants—spirits sent to care for people who will inherit salvation.
HEB.2.1	So we must listen very carefully to the truth we have heard, or we may drift away from it. 
HEB.2.2	For the message God delivered through angels has always stood firm, and every violation of the law and every act of disobedience was punished. 
HEB.2.3	So what makes us think we can escape if we ignore this great salvation that was first announced by the Lord Jesus himself and then delivered to us by those who heard him speak? 
HEB.2.4	And God confirmed the message by giving signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit whenever he chose.
HEB.2.5	And furthermore, it is not angels who will control the future world we are talking about. 
HEB.2.6	For in one place the Scriptures say, 
HEB.2.6	“What are mere mortals that you should think about them,
HEB.2.6	or a son of man
HEB.2.7	Yet for a little while you made them a little lower than the angels
HEB.2.7	and crowned them with glory and honor.
HEB.2.8	You gave them authority over all things.”
HEB.2.8	Now when it says “all things,” it means nothing is left out. But we have not yet seen all things put under their authority. 
HEB.2.9	What we do see is Jesus, who for a little while was given a position “a little lower than the angels”; and because he suffered death for us, he is now “crowned with glory and honor.” Yes, by God’s grace, Jesus tasted death for everyone. 
HEB.2.10	God, for whom and through whom everything was made, chose to bring many children into glory. And it was only right that he should make Jesus, through his suffering, a perfect leader, fit to bring them into their salvation.
HEB.2.11	So now Jesus and the ones he makes holy have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.
HEB.2.12	For he said to God,
HEB.2.12	“I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters.
HEB.2.12	I will praise you among your assembled people.”
HEB.2.13	He also said,
HEB.2.13	“I will put my trust in him,”
HEB.2.13	that is, “I and the children God has given me.”
HEB.2.14	Because God’s children are human beings—made of flesh and blood—the Son also became flesh and blood. For only as a human being could he die, and only by dying could he break the power of the devil, who had
HEB.2.15	Only in this way could he set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying.
HEB.2.16	We also know that the Son did not come to help angels; he came to help the descendants of Abraham. 
HEB.2.17	Therefore, it was necessary for him to be made in every respect like us, his brothers and sisters,
HEB.2.18	Since he himself has gone through suffering and testing, he is able to help us when we are being tested.
HEB.3.1	And so, dear brothers and sisters who belong to God and
HEB.3.2	For he was faithful to God, who appointed him, just as Moses served faithfully when he was entrusted with God’s entire
HEB.3.3	But Jesus deserves far more glory than Moses, just as a person who builds a house deserves more praise than the house itself. 
HEB.3.4	For every house has a builder, but the one who built everything is God.
HEB.3.5	Moses was certainly faithful in God’s house as a servant. His work was an illustration of the truths God would reveal later. 
HEB.3.6	But Christ, as the Son, is in charge of God’s entire house. And we are God’s house, if we keep our courage and remain confident in our hope in Christ.
HEB.3.7	That is why the Holy Spirit says,
HEB.3.7	“Today when you hear his voice,
HEB.3.8	don’t harden your hearts
HEB.3.8	as Israel did when they rebelled,
HEB.3.8	when they tested me in the wilderness.
HEB.3.9	There your ancestors tested and tried my patience,
HEB.3.9	even though they saw my miracles for forty years.
HEB.3.10	So I was angry with them, and I said,
HEB.3.10	‘Their hearts always turn away from me.
HEB.3.10	They refuse to do what I tell them.’
HEB.3.11	So in my anger I took an oath:
HEB.3.11	‘They will never enter my place of rest.’”
HEB.3.12	Be careful then, dear brothers and sisters.
HEB.3.13	You must warn each other every day, while it is still “today,” so that none of you will be deceived by sin and hardened against God. 
HEB.3.14	For if we are faithful to the end, trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed, we will share in all that belongs to Christ. 
HEB.3.15	Remember what it says: 
HEB.3.15	“Today when you hear his voice,
HEB.3.15	don’t harden your hearts
HEB.3.15	as Israel did when they rebelled.”
HEB.3.16	And who was it who rebelled against God, even though they heard his voice? Wasn’t it the people Moses led out of Egypt? 
HEB.3.17	And who made God angry for forty years? Wasn’t it the people who sinned, whose corpses lay in the wilderness? 
HEB.3.18	And to whom was God speaking when he took an oath that they would never enter his rest? Wasn’t it the people who disobeyed him? 
HEB.3.19	So we see that because of their unbelief they were not able to enter his rest.
HEB.4.1	God’s promise of entering his rest still stands, so we ought to tremble with fear that some of you might fail to experience it. 
HEB.4.2	For this good news—that God has prepared this rest—has been announced to us just as it was to them. But it did them no good because they didn’t share the faith of those who listened to God.
HEB.4.3	For only we who believe can enter his rest. As for the others, God said, 
HEB.4.3	“In my anger I took an oath:
HEB.4.3	‘They will never enter my place of rest,’”
HEB.4.3	even though this rest has been ready since he made the world. 
HEB.4.4	We know it is ready because of the place in the Scriptures where it mentions the seventh day: “On the seventh day God rested from all his work.”
HEB.4.5	But in the other passage God said, “They will never enter my place of rest.”
HEB.4.6	So God’s rest is there for people to enter, but those who first heard this good news failed to enter because they disobeyed God. 
HEB.4.7	So God set another time for entering his rest, and that time is today. God announced this through David much later in the words already quoted: 
HEB.4.7	“Today when you hear his voice,
HEB.4.7	don’t harden your hearts.”
HEB.4.8	Now if Joshua had succeeded in giving them this rest, God would not have spoken about another day of rest still to come. 
HEB.4.9	So there is a special rest
HEB.4.10	For all who have entered into God’s rest have rested from their labors, just as God did after creating the world. 
HEB.4.11	So let us do our best to enter that rest. But if we disobey God, as the people of Israel did, we will fall.
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires. 
HEB.4.13	Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he is the one to whom we are accountable.
HEB.4.14	So then, since we have a great High Priest who has entered heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we believe. 
HEB.4.15	This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet he did not sin. 
HEB.4.16	So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.
HEB.5.1	Every high priest is a man chosen to represent other people in their dealings with God. He presents their gifts to God and offers sacrifices for their sins. 
HEB.5.2	And he is able to deal gently with ignorant and wayward people because he himself is subject to the same weaknesses. 
HEB.5.3	That is why he must offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as theirs.
HEB.5.4	And no one can become a high priest simply because he wants such an honor. He must be called by God for this work, just as Aaron was. 
HEB.5.5	That is why Christ did not honor himself by assuming he could become High Priest. No, he was chosen by God, who said to him,
HEB.5.5	“You are my Son.
HEB.5.5	Today I have become your Father.
HEB.5.6	And in another passage God said to him,
HEB.5.6	“You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”
HEB.5.7	While Jesus was here on earth, he offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who could rescue him from death. And God heard his prayers because of his deep reverence for God. 
HEB.5.8	Even though Jesus was God’s Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered. 
HEB.5.9	In this way, God qualified him as a perfect High Priest, and he became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him. 
HEB.5.10	And God designated him to be a High Priest in the order of Melchizedek.
HEB.5.11	There is much more we would like to say about this, but it is difficult to explain, especially since you are spiritually dull and don’t seem to listen. 
HEB.5.12	You have been believers so long now that you ought to be teaching others. Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things about God’s word.
HEB.5.13	For someone who lives on milk is still an infant and doesn’t know how to do what is right. 
HEB.5.14	Solid food is for those who are mature, who through training have the skill to recognize the difference between right and wrong.
HEB.6.1	So let us stop going over the basic teachings about Christ again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don’t need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds
HEB.6.2	You don’t need further instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 
HEB.6.3	And so, God willing, we will move forward to further understanding.
HEB.6.4	For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened—those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit, 
HEB.6.5	who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come—
HEB.6.6	and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance; by rejecting the Son of God, they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame.
HEB.6.7	When the ground soaks up the falling rain and bears a good crop for the farmer, it has God’s blessing. 
HEB.6.8	But if a field bears thorns and thistles, it is useless. The farmer will soon condemn that field and burn it.
HEB.6.9	Dear friends, even though we are talking this way, we really don’t believe it applies to you. We are confident that you are meant for better things, things that come with salvation. 
HEB.6.10	For God is not unjust. He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other believers,
HEB.6.11	Our great desire is that you will keep on loving others as long as life lasts, in order to make certain that what you hope for will come true. 
HEB.6.12	Then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent. Instead, you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God’s promises because of their faith and endurance.
HEB.6.13	For example, there was God’s promise to Abraham. Since there was no one greater to swear by, God took an oath in his own name, saying:
HEB.6.14	“I will certainly bless you,
HEB.6.14	and I will multiply your descendants beyond number.”
HEB.6.15	Then Abraham waited patiently, and he received what God had promised.
HEB.6.16	Now when people take an oath, they call on someone greater than themselves to hold them to it. And without any question that oath is binding. 
HEB.6.17	God also bound himself with an oath, so that those who received the promise could be perfectly sure that he would never change his mind. 
HEB.6.18	So God has given both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us. 
HEB.6.19	This hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain into God’s inner sanctuary. 
HEB.6.20	Jesus has already gone in there for us. He has become our eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek.
HEB.7.1	This Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem and also a priest of God Most High. When Abraham was returning home after winning a great battle against the kings, Melchizedek met him and blessed him. 
HEB.7.2	Then Abraham took a tenth of all he had captured in battle and gave it to Melchizedek. The name Melchizedek means “king of justice,” and king of Salem means “king of peace.” 
HEB.7.3	There is no record of his father or mother or any of his ancestors—no beginning or end to his life. He remains a priest forever, resembling the Son of God.
HEB.7.4	Consider then how great this Melchizedek was. Even Abraham, the great patriarch of Israel, recognized this by giving him a tenth of what he had taken in battle. 
HEB.7.5	Now the law of Moses required that the priests, who are descendants of Levi, must collect a tithe from the rest of the people of Israel,
HEB.7.6	But Melchizedek, who was not a descendant of Levi, collected a tenth from Abraham. And Melchizedek placed a blessing upon Abraham, the one who had already received the promises of God. 
HEB.7.7	And without question, the person who has the power to give a blessing is greater than the one who is blessed.
HEB.7.8	The priests who collect tithes are men who die, so Melchizedek is greater than they are, because we are told that he lives on. 
HEB.7.9	In addition, we might even say that these Levites—the ones who collect the tithe—paid a tithe to Melchizedek when their ancestor Abraham paid a tithe to him. 
HEB.7.10	For although Levi wasn’t born yet, the seed from which he came was in Abraham’s body when Melchizedek collected the tithe from him.
HEB.7.11	So if the priesthood of Levi, on which the law was based, could have achieved the perfection God intended, why did God need to establish a different priesthood, with a priest in the order of Melchizedek instead of the order of Levi and Aaron?
HEB.7.12	And if the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed to permit it. 
HEB.7.13	For the priest we are talking about belongs to a different tribe, whose members have never served at the altar as priests. 
HEB.7.14	What I mean is, our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses never mentioned priests coming from that tribe.
HEB.7.15	This change has been made very clear since a different priest, who is like Melchizedek, has appeared. 
HEB.7.16	Jesus became a priest, not by meeting the physical requirement of belonging to the tribe of Levi, but by the power of a life that cannot be destroyed. 
HEB.7.17	And the psalmist pointed this out when he prophesied, 
HEB.7.17	“You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”
HEB.7.18	Yes, the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless. 
HEB.7.19	For the law never made anything perfect. But now we have confidence in a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
HEB.7.20	This new system was established with a solemn oath. Aaron’s descendants became priests without such an oath, 
HEB.7.21	but there was an oath regarding Jesus. For God said to him,
HEB.7.21	“The 
HEB.7.21	‘You are a priest forever.’”
HEB.7.22	Because of this oath, Jesus is the one who guarantees this better covenant with God.
HEB.7.23	There were many priests under the old system, for death prevented them from remaining in office. 
HEB.7.24	But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood lasts forever. 
HEB.7.25	Therefore he is able, once and forever, to save
HEB.7.26	He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin. He has been set apart from sinners and has been given the highest place of honor in heaven.
HEB.7.27	Unlike those other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices every day. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people’s sins. 
HEB.7.28	The law appointed high priests who were limited by human weakness. But after the law was given, God appointed his Son with an oath, and his Son has been made the perfect High Priest forever.
HEB.8.1	Here is the main point: We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honor beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven. 
HEB.8.2	There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle,
HEB.8.3	And since every high priest is required to offer gifts and sacrifices, our High Priest must make an offering, too. 
HEB.8.4	If he were here on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there already are priests who offer the gifts required by the law. 
HEB.8.5	They serve in a system of worship that is only a copy, a shadow of the real one in heaven. For when Moses was getting ready to build the Tabernacle, God gave him this warning: “Be sure that you make everything according to the pattern I have shown you here on the mountain.”
HEB.8.6	But now Jesus, our High Priest, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant with God, based on better promises.
HEB.8.7	If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it. 
HEB.8.8	But when God found fault with the people, he said:
HEB.8.8	“The day is coming, says the 
HEB.8.8	when I will make a new covenant
HEB.8.8	with the people of Israel and Judah.
HEB.8.9	This covenant will not be like the one
HEB.8.9	I made with their ancestors
HEB.8.9	when I took them by the hand
HEB.8.9	and led them out of the land of Egypt.
HEB.8.9	They did not remain faithful to my covenant,
HEB.8.9	so I turned my back on them, says the 
HEB.8.10	But this is the new covenant I will make
HEB.8.10	with the people of Israel on that day,
HEB.8.10	I will put my laws in their minds,
HEB.8.10	and I will write them on their hearts.
HEB.8.10	I will be their God,
HEB.8.10	and they will be my people.
HEB.8.11	And they will not need to teach their neighbors,
HEB.8.11	nor will they need to teach their relatives,
HEB.8.11	saying, ‘You should know the 
HEB.8.11	For everyone, from the least to the greatest,
HEB.8.11	will know me already.
HEB.8.12	And I will forgive their wickedness,
HEB.8.12	and I will never again remember their sins.”
HEB.8.13	When God speaks of a “new” covenant, it means he has made the first one obsolete. It is now out of date and will soon disappear.
HEB.9.1	That first covenant between God and Israel had regulations for worship and a place of worship here on earth. 
HEB.9.2	There were two rooms in that Tabernacle.
HEB.9.3	Then there was a curtain, and behind the curtain was the second room
HEB.9.4	In that room were a gold incense altar and a wooden chest called the Ark of the Covenant, which was covered with gold on all sides. Inside the Ark were a gold jar containing manna, Aaron’s staff that sprouted leaves, and the stone tablets of the covenant. 
HEB.9.5	Above the Ark were the cherubim of divine glory, whose wings stretched out over the Ark’s cover, the place of atonement. But we cannot explain these things in detail now.
HEB.9.6	When these things were all in place, the priests regularly entered the first room
HEB.9.7	But only the high priest ever entered the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. And he always offered blood for his own sins and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. 
HEB.9.8	By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the Tabernacle
HEB.9.9	This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them. 
HEB.9.10	For that old system deals only with food and drink and various cleansing ceremonies—physical regulations that were in effect only until a better system could be established.
HEB.9.11	So Christ has now become the High Priest over all the good things that have come.
HEB.9.12	With his own blood—not the blood of goats and calves—he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time and secured our redemption forever.
HEB.9.13	Under the old system, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer could cleanse people’s bodies from ceremonial impurity. 
HEB.9.14	Just think how much more the blood of Christ will purify our consciences from sinful deeds
HEB.9.15	That is why he is the one who mediates a new covenant between God and people, so that all who are called can receive the eternal inheritance God has promised them. For Christ died to set them free from the penalty of the sins they had committed under that first covenant.
HEB.9.16	Now when someone leaves a will,
HEB.9.17	The will goes into effect only after the person’s death. While the person who made it is still alive, the will cannot be put into effect.
HEB.9.18	That is why even the first covenant was put into effect with the blood of an animal. 
HEB.9.19	For after Moses had read each of God’s commandments to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats,
HEB.9.20	Then he said, “This blood confirms the covenant God has made with you.”
HEB.9.21	And in the same way, he sprinkled blood on the Tabernacle and on everything used for worship. 
HEB.9.22	In fact, according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified with blood. For without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness.
HEB.9.23	That is why the Tabernacle and everything in it, which were copies of things in heaven, had to be purified by the blood of animals. But the real things in heaven had to be purified with far better sacrifices than the blood of animals.
HEB.9.24	For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with human hands, which was only a copy of the true one in heaven. He entered into heaven itself to appear now before God on our behalf. 
HEB.9.25	And he did not enter heaven to offer himself again and again, like the high priest here on earth who enters the Most Holy Place year after year with the blood of an animal. 
HEB.9.26	If that had been necessary, Christ would have had to die again and again, ever since the world began. But now, once for all time, he has appeared at the end of the age
HEB.9.27	And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment, 
HEB.9.28	so also Christ was offered once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again, not to deal with our sins, but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him.
HEB.10.1	The old system under the law of Moses was only a shadow, a dim preview of the good things to come, not the good things themselves. The sacrifices under that system were repeated again and again, year after year, but they were never able to provide perfect cleansing for those who came to worship. 
HEB.10.2	If they could have provided perfect cleansing, the sacrifices would have stopped, for the worshipers would have been purified once for all time, and their feelings of guilt would have disappeared.
HEB.10.3	But instead, those sacrifices actually reminded them of their sins year after year. 
HEB.10.4	For it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 
HEB.10.5	That is why, when Christ
HEB.10.5	“You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings.
HEB.10.5	But you have given me a body to offer.
HEB.10.6	You were not pleased with burnt offerings
HEB.10.6	or other offerings for sin.
HEB.10.7	Then I said, ‘Look, I have come to do your will, O God—
HEB.10.7	as is written about me in the Scriptures.’”
HEB.10.8	First, Christ said, “You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings or burnt offerings or other offerings for sin, nor were you pleased with them” (though they are required by the law of Moses). 
HEB.10.9	Then he said, “Look, I have come to do your will.” He cancels the first covenant in order to put the second into effect. 
HEB.10.10	For God’s will was for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.
HEB.10.11	Under the old covenant, the priest stands and ministers before the altar day after day, offering the same sacrifices again and again, which can never take away sins. 
HEB.10.12	But our High Priest offered himself to God as a single sacrifice for sins, good for all time. Then he sat down in the place of honor at God’s right hand. 
HEB.10.13	There he waits until his enemies are humbled and made a footstool under his feet. 
HEB.10.14	For by that one offering he forever made perfect those who are being made holy.
HEB.10.15	And the Holy Spirit also testifies that this is so. For he says,
HEB.10.16	“This is the new covenant I will make
HEB.10.16	with my people on that day,
HEB.10.16	I will put my laws in their hearts,
HEB.10.16	and I will write them on their minds.”
HEB.10.17	Then he says,
HEB.10.17	“I will never again remember
HEB.10.17	their sins and lawless deeds.”
HEB.10.18	And when sins have been forgiven, there is no need to offer any more sacrifices.
HEB.10.19	And so, dear brothers and sisters,
HEB.10.20	By his death,
HEB.10.21	And since we have a great High Priest who rules over God’s house, 
HEB.10.22	let us go right into the presence of God with sincere hearts fully trusting him. For our guilty consciences have been sprinkled with Christ’s blood to make us clean, and our bodies have been washed with pure water.
HEB.10.23	Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm, for God can be trusted to keep his promise. 
HEB.10.24	Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. 
HEB.10.25	And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.
HEB.10.26	Dear friends, if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice that will cover these sins. 
HEB.10.27	There is only the terrible expectation of God’s judgment and the raging fire that will consume his enemies. 
HEB.10.28	For anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
HEB.10.29	Just think how much worse the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God, and have treated the blood of the covenant, which made us holy, as if it were common and unholy, and have insulted and disdained the Holy Spirit who brings God’s mercy to us. 
HEB.10.30	For we know the one who said,
HEB.10.30	“I will take revenge.
HEB.10.30	I will pay them back.”
HEB.10.30	He also said,
HEB.10.30	“The 
HEB.10.31	It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	Think back on those early days when you first learned about Christ.
HEB.10.33	Sometimes you were exposed to public ridicule and were beaten, and sometimes you helped others who were suffering the same things. 
HEB.10.34	You suffered along with those who were thrown into jail, and when all you owned was taken from you, you accepted it with joy. You knew there were better things waiting for you that will last forever.
HEB.10.35	So do not throw away this confident trust in the Lord. Remember the great reward it brings you! 
HEB.10.36	Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God’s will. Then you will receive all that he has promised.
HEB.10.37	“For in just a little while,
HEB.10.37	the Coming One will come and not delay.
HEB.10.38	And my righteous ones will live by faith.
HEB.10.38	But I will take no pleasure in anyone who turns away.”
HEB.10.39	But we are not like those who turn away from God to their own destruction. We are the faithful ones, whose souls will be saved.
HEB.11.1	Faith shows the reality of what we hope for; it is the evidence of things we cannot see. 
HEB.11.2	Through their faith, the people in days of old earned a good reputation.
HEB.11.3	By faith we understand that the entire universe was formed at God’s command, that what we now see did not come from anything that can be seen.
HEB.11.4	It was by faith that Abel brought a more acceptable offering to God than Cain did. Abel’s offering gave evidence that he was a righteous man, and God showed his approval of his gifts. Although Abel is long dead, he still speaks to us by his example of faith.
HEB.11.5	It was by faith that Enoch was taken up to heaven without dying—“he disappeared, because God took him.”
HEB.11.6	And it is impossible to please God without faith. Anyone who wants to come to him must believe that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him.
HEB.11.7	It was by faith that Noah built a large boat to save his family from the flood. He obeyed God, who warned him about things that had never happened before. By his faith Noah condemned the rest of the world, and he received the righteousness that comes by faith.
HEB.11.8	It was by faith that Abraham obeyed when God called him to leave home and go to another land that God would give him as his inheritance. He went without knowing where he was going. 
HEB.11.9	And even when he reached the land God promised him, he lived there by faith—for he was like a foreigner, living in tents. And so did Isaac and Jacob, who inherited the same promise. 
HEB.11.10	Abraham was confidently looking forward to a city with eternal foundations, a city designed and built by God.
HEB.11.11	It was by faith that even Sarah was able to have a child, though she was barren and was too old. She believed
HEB.11.12	And so a whole nation came from this one man who was as good as dead—a nation with so many people that, like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore, there is no way to count them.
HEB.11.13	All these people died still believing what God had promised them. They did not receive what was promised, but they saw it all from a distance and welcomed it. They agreed that they were foreigners and nomads here on earth. 
HEB.11.14	Obviously people who say such things are looking forward to a country they can call their own. 
HEB.11.15	If they had longed for the country they came from, they could have gone back. 
HEB.11.16	But they were looking for a better place, a heavenly homeland. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
HEB.11.17	It was by faith that Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God was testing him. Abraham, who had received God’s promises, was ready to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, 
HEB.11.18	even though God had told him, “Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted.”
HEB.11.19	Abraham reasoned that if Isaac died, God was able to bring him back to life again. And in a sense, Abraham did receive his son back from the dead.
HEB.11.20	It was by faith that Isaac promised blessings for the future to his sons, Jacob and Esau.
HEB.11.21	It was by faith that Jacob, when he was old and dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons and bowed in worship as he leaned on his staff.
HEB.11.22	It was by faith that Joseph, when he was about to die, said confidently that the people of Israel would leave Egypt. He even commanded them to take his bones with them when they left.
HEB.11.23	It was by faith that Moses’ parents hid him for three months when he was born. They saw that God had given them an unusual child, and they were not afraid to disobey the king’s command.
HEB.11.24	It was by faith that Moses, when he grew up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. 
HEB.11.25	He chose to share the oppression of God’s people instead of enjoying the fleeting pleasures of sin. 
HEB.11.26	He thought it was better to suffer for the sake of Christ than to own the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his great reward. 
HEB.11.27	It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger. He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible. 
HEB.11.28	It was by faith that Moses commanded the people of Israel to keep the Passover and to sprinkle blood on the doorposts so that the angel of death would not kill their firstborn sons.
HEB.11.29	It was by faith that the people of Israel went right through the Red Sea as though they were on dry ground. But when the Egyptians tried to follow, they were all drowned.
HEB.11.30	It was by faith that the people of Israel marched around Jericho for seven days, and the walls came crashing down.
HEB.11.31	It was by faith that Rahab the prostitute was not destroyed with the people in her city who refused to obey God. For she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.
HEB.11.32	How much more do I need to say? It would take too long to recount the stories of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and all the prophets. 
HEB.11.33	By faith these people overthrew kingdoms, ruled with justice, and received what God had promised them. They shut the mouths of lions, 
HEB.11.34	quenched the flames of fire, and escaped death by the edge of the sword. Their weakness was turned to strength. They became strong in battle and put whole armies to flight. 
HEB.11.35	Women received their loved ones back again from death.
HEB.11.35	But others were tortured, refusing to turn from God in order to be set free. They placed their hope in a better life after the resurrection. 
HEB.11.36	Some were jeered at, and their backs were cut open with whips. Others were chained in prisons. 
HEB.11.37	Some died by stoning, some were sawed in half,
HEB.11.38	They were too good for this world, wandering over deserts and mountains, hiding in caves and holes in the ground.
HEB.11.39	All these people earned a good reputation because of their faith, yet none of them received all that God had promised. 
HEB.11.40	For God had something better in mind for us, so that they would not reach perfection without us.
HEB.12.1	Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith, let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially the sin that so easily trips us up. And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us. 
HEB.12.2	We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus, the champion who initiates and perfects our faith.
HEB.12.3	Think of all the hostility he endured from sinful people;
HEB.12.4	After all, you have not yet given your lives in your struggle against sin.
HEB.12.5	And have you forgotten the encouraging words God spoke to you as his children?
HEB.12.5	“My child,
HEB.12.5	and don’t give up when he corrects you.
HEB.12.6	For the 
HEB.12.6	and he punishes each one he accepts as his child.”
HEB.12.7	As you endure this divine discipline, remember that God is treating you as his own children. Who ever heard of a child who is never disciplined by its father? 
HEB.12.8	If God doesn’t discipline you as he does all of his children, it means that you are illegitimate and are not really his children at all. 
HEB.12.9	Since we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us, shouldn’t we submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits, and live forever?
HEB.12.10	For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how. But God’s discipline is always good for us, so that we might share in his holiness. 
HEB.12.11	No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening—it’s painful! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.
HEB.12.12	So take a new grip with your tired hands and strengthen your weak knees. 
HEB.12.13	Mark out a straight path for your feet so that those who are weak and lame will not fall but become strong.
HEB.12.14	Work at living in peace with everyone, and work at living a holy life, for those who are not holy will not see the Lord. 
HEB.12.15	Look after each other so that none of you fails to receive the grace of God. Watch out that no poisonous root of bitterness grows up to trouble you, corrupting many. 
HEB.12.16	Make sure that no one is immoral or godless like Esau, who traded his birthright as the firstborn son for a single meal. 
HEB.12.17	You know that afterward, when he wanted his father’s blessing, he was rejected. It was too late for repentance, even though he begged with bitter tears.
HEB.12.18	You have not come to a physical mountain,
HEB.12.19	For they heard an awesome trumpet blast and a voice so terrible that they begged God to stop speaking. 
HEB.12.20	They staggered back under God’s command: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death.”
HEB.12.21	Moses himself was so frightened at the sight that he said, “I am terrified and trembling.”
HEB.12.22	No, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless thousands of angels in a joyful gathering. 
HEB.12.23	You have come to the assembly of God’s firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect. 
HEB.12.24	You have come to Jesus, the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel.
HEB.12.25	Be careful that you do not refuse to listen to the One who is speaking. For if the people of Israel did not escape when they refused to listen to Moses, the earthly messenger, we will certainly not escape if we reject the One who speaks to us from heaven! 
HEB.12.26	When God spoke from Mount Sinai his voice shook the earth, but now he makes another promise: “Once again I will shake not only the earth but the heavens also.”
HEB.12.27	This means that all of creation will be shaken and removed, so that only unshakable things will remain.
HEB.12.28	Since we are receiving a Kingdom that is unshakable, let us be thankful and please God by worshiping him with holy fear and awe. 
HEB.12.29	For our God is a devouring fire.
HEB.13.1	Keep on loving each other as brothers and sisters.
HEB.13.2	Don’t forget to show hospitality to strangers, for some who have done this have entertained angels without realizing it! 
HEB.13.3	Remember those in prison, as if you were there yourself. Remember also those being mistreated, as if you felt their pain in your own bodies.
HEB.13.4	Give honor to marriage, and remain faithful to one another in marriage. God will surely judge people who are immoral and those who commit adultery.
HEB.13.5	Don’t love money; be satisfied with what you have. For God has said,
HEB.13.5	“I will never fail you.
HEB.13.5	I will never abandon you.”
HEB.13.6	So we can say with confidence,
HEB.13.6	“The 
HEB.13.6	so I will have no fear.
HEB.13.6	What can mere people do to me?”
HEB.13.7	Remember your leaders who taught you the word of God. Think of all the good that has come from their lives, and follow the example of their faith.
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. 
HEB.13.9	So do not be attracted by strange, new ideas. Your strength comes from God’s grace, not from rules about food, which don’t help those who follow them.
HEB.13.10	We have an altar from which the priests in the Tabernacle
HEB.13.11	Under the old system, the high priest brought the blood of animals into the Holy Place as a sacrifice for sin, and the bodies of the animals were burned outside the camp. 
HEB.13.12	So also Jesus suffered and died outside the city gates to make his people holy by means of his own blood. 
HEB.13.13	So let us go out to him, outside the camp, and bear the disgrace he bore. 
HEB.13.14	For this world is not our permanent home; we are looking forward to a home yet to come.
HEB.13.15	Therefore, let us offer through Jesus a continual sacrifice of praise to God, proclaiming our allegiance to his name. 
HEB.13.16	And don’t forget to do good and to share with those in need. These are the sacrifices that please God.
HEB.13.17	Obey your spiritual leaders, and do what they say. Their work is to watch over your souls, and they are accountable to God. Give them reason to do this with joy and not with sorrow. That would certainly not be for your benefit.
HEB.13.18	Pray for us, for our conscience is clear and we want to live honorably in everything we do. 
HEB.13.19	And especially pray that I will be able to come back to you soon.
HEB.13.20	Now may the God of peace—
HEB.13.20	who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus,
HEB.13.20	the great Shepherd of the sheep,
HEB.13.20	and ratified an eternal covenant with his blood—
HEB.13.21	may he equip you with all you need
HEB.13.21	for doing his will.
HEB.13.21	May he produce in you,
HEB.13.21	through the power of Jesus Christ,
HEB.13.21	every good thing that is pleasing to him.
HEB.13.21	All glory to him forever and ever! Amen.
HEB.13.22	I urge you, dear brothers and sisters,
HEB.13.23	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released from jail. If he comes here soon, I will bring him with me to see you.
HEB.13.24	Greet all your leaders and all the believers there.
HEB.13.25	May God’s grace be with you all.
JAS.1.1	This letter is from James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
JAS.1.1	I am writing to the “twelve tribes”—Jewish believers scattered abroad.
JAS.1.1	Greetings!
JAS.1.2	Dear brothers and sisters,
JAS.1.3	For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. 
JAS.1.4	So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.
JAS.1.5	If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking. 
JAS.1.6	But when you ask him, be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind. 
JAS.1.7	Such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. 
JAS.1.8	Their loyalty is divided between God and the world, and they are unstable in everything they do.
JAS.1.9	Believers who are
JAS.1.10	And those who are rich should boast that God has humbled them. They will fade away like a little flower in the field. 
JAS.1.11	The hot sun rises and the grass withers; the little flower droops and falls, and its beauty fades away. In the same way, the rich will fade away with all of their achievements.
JAS.1.12	God blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation. Afterward they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. 
JAS.1.13	And remember, when you are being tempted, do not say, “God is tempting me.” God is never tempted to do wrong,
JAS.1.14	Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away. 
JAS.1.15	These desires give birth to sinful actions. And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death.
JAS.1.16	So don’t be misled, my dear brothers and sisters. 
JAS.1.17	Whatever is good and perfect is a gift coming down to us from God our Father, who created all the lights in the heavens.
JAS.1.18	He chose to give birth to us by giving us his true word. And we, out of all creation, became his prized possession.
JAS.1.19	Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. 
JAS.1.20	Human anger
JAS.1.21	So get rid of all the filth and evil in your lives, and humbly accept the word God has planted in your hearts, for it has the power to save your souls.
JAS.1.22	But don’t just listen to God’s word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves. 
JAS.1.23	For if you listen to the word and don’t obey, it is like glancing at your face in a mirror. 
JAS.1.24	You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like. 
JAS.1.25	But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don’t forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.
JAS.1.26	If you claim to be religious but don’t control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless. 
JAS.1.27	Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you.
JAS.2.1	My dear brothers and sisters,
JAS.2.2	For example, suppose someone comes into your meeting
JAS.2.3	If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you say to the poor one, “You can stand over there, or else sit on the floor”—well, 
JAS.2.4	doesn’t this discrimination show that your judgments are guided by evil motives?
JAS.2.5	Listen to me, dear brothers and sisters. Hasn’t God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith? Aren’t they the ones who will inherit the Kingdom he promised to those who love him? 
JAS.2.6	But you dishonor the poor! Isn’t it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court? 
JAS.2.7	Aren’t they the ones who slander Jesus Christ, whose noble name
JAS.2.8	Yes indeed, it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the Scriptures: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”
JAS.2.9	But if you favor some people over others, you are committing a sin. You are guilty of breaking the law.
JAS.2.10	For the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws. 
JAS.2.11	For the same God who said, “You must not commit adultery,” also said, “You must not murder.”
JAS.2.12	So whatever you say or whatever you do, remember that you will be judged by the law that sets you free. 
JAS.2.13	There will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others. But if you have been merciful, God will be merciful when he judges you.
JAS.2.14	What good is it, dear brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but don’t show it by your actions? Can that kind of faith save anyone? 
JAS.2.15	Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing, 
JAS.2.16	and you say, “Good-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well”—but then you don’t give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do?
JAS.2.17	So you see, faith by itself isn’t enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless.
JAS.2.18	Now someone may argue, “Some people have faith; others have good deeds.” But I say, “How can you show me your faith if you don’t have good deeds? I will show you my faith by my good deeds.”
JAS.2.19	You say you have faith, for you believe that there is one God.
JAS.2.20	How foolish! Can’t you see that faith without good deeds is useless?
JAS.2.21	Don’t you remember that our ancestor Abraham was shown to be right with God by his actions when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? 
JAS.2.22	You see, his faith and his actions worked together. His actions made his faith complete. 
JAS.2.23	And so it happened just as the Scriptures say: “Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.”
JAS.2.24	So you see, we are shown to be right with God by what we do, not by faith alone.
JAS.2.25	Rahab the prostitute is another example. She was shown to be right with God by her actions when she hid those messengers and sent them safely away by a different road. 
JAS.2.26	Just as the body is dead without breath,
JAS.3.1	Dear brothers and sisters,
JAS.3.2	Indeed, we all make many mistakes. For if we could control our tongues, we would be perfect and could also control ourselves in every other way.
JAS.3.3	We can make a large horse go wherever we want by means of a small bit in its mouth. 
JAS.3.4	And a small rudder makes a huge ship turn wherever the pilot chooses to go, even though the winds are strong. 
JAS.3.5	In the same way, the tongue is a small thing that makes grand speeches.
JAS.3.5	But a tiny spark can set a great forest on fire. 
JAS.3.6	And among all the parts of the body, the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of wickedness, corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, for it is set on fire by hell itself.
JAS.3.7	People can tame all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and fish, 
JAS.3.8	but no one can tame the tongue. It is restless and evil, full of deadly poison. 
JAS.3.9	Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father, and sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God. 
JAS.3.10	And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth. Surely, my brothers and sisters, this is not right! 
JAS.3.11	Does a spring of water bubble out with both fresh water and bitter water? 
JAS.3.12	Does a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? No, and you can’t draw fresh water from a salty spring.
JAS.3.13	If you are wise and understand God’s ways, prove it by living an honorable life, doing good works with the humility that comes from wisdom. 
JAS.3.14	But if you are bitterly jealous and there is selfish ambition in your heart, don’t cover up the truth with boasting and lying. 
JAS.3.15	For jealousy and selfishness are not God’s kind of wisdom. Such things are earthly, unspiritual, and demonic. 
JAS.3.16	For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind.
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and the fruit of good deeds. It shows no favoritism and is always sincere. 
JAS.3.18	And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness.
JAS.4.1	What is causing the quarrels and fights among you? Don’t they come from the evil desires at war within you? 
JAS.4.2	You want what you don’t have, so you scheme and kill to get it. You are jealous of what others have, but you can’t get it, so you fight and wage war to take it away from them. Yet you don’t have what you want because you don’t ask God for it. 
JAS.4.3	And even when you ask, you don’t get it because your motives are all wrong—you want only what will give you pleasure.
JAS.4.4	You adulterers!
JAS.4.5	Do you think the Scriptures have no meaning? They say that God is passionate that the spirit he has placed within us should be faithful to him.
JAS.4.6	And he gives grace generously. As the Scriptures say,
JAS.4.6	“God opposes the proud
JAS.4.6	but gives grace to the humble.”
JAS.4.7	So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
JAS.4.8	Come close to God, and God will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners; purify your hearts, for your loyalty is divided between God and the world. 
JAS.4.9	Let there be tears for what you have done. Let there be sorrow and deep grief. Let there be sadness instead of laughter, and gloom instead of joy. 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up in honor.
JAS.4.11	Don’t speak evil against each other, dear brothers and sisters.
JAS.4.12	God alone, who gave the law, is the Judge. He alone has the power to save or to destroy. So what right do you have to judge your neighbor?
JAS.4.13	Look here, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we are going to a certain town and will stay there a year. We will do business there and make a profit.” 
JAS.4.14	How do you know what your life will be like tomorrow? Your life is like the morning fog—it’s here a little while, then it’s gone. 
JAS.4.15	What you ought to say is, “If the Lord wants us to, we will live and do this or that.” 
JAS.4.16	Otherwise you are boasting about your own pretentious plans, and all such boasting is evil.
JAS.4.17	Remember, it is sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it.
JAS.5.1	Look here, you rich people: Weep and groan with anguish because of all the terrible troubles ahead of you. 
JAS.5.2	Your wealth is rotting away, and your fine clothes are moth-eaten rags. 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver are corroded. The very wealth you were counting on will eat away your flesh like fire. This corroded treasure you have hoarded will testify against you on the day of judgment. 
JAS.5.4	For listen! Hear the cries of the field workers whom you have cheated of their pay. The cries of those who harvest your fields have reached the ears of the 
JAS.5.5	You have spent your years on earth in luxury, satisfying your every desire. You have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter. 
JAS.5.6	You have condemned and killed innocent people,
JAS.5.7	Dear brothers and sisters,
JAS.5.8	You, too, must be patient. Take courage, for the coming of the Lord is near.
JAS.5.9	Don’t grumble about each other, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. For look—the Judge is standing at the door!
JAS.5.10	For examples of patience in suffering, dear brothers and sisters, look at the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.11	We give great honor to those who endure under suffering. For instance, you know about Job, a man of great endurance. You can see how the Lord was kind to him at the end, for the Lord is full of tenderness and mercy.
JAS.5.12	But most of all, my brothers and sisters, never take an oath, by heaven or earth or anything else. Just say a simple yes or no, so that you will not sin and be condemned.
JAS.5.13	Are any of you suffering hardships? You should pray. Are any of you happy? You should sing praises. 
JAS.5.14	Are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.15	Such a prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will make you well. And if you have committed any sins, you will be forgiven.
JAS.5.16	Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results. 
JAS.5.17	Elijah was as human as we are, and yet when he prayed earnestly that no rain would fall, none fell for three and a half years! 
JAS.5.18	Then, when he prayed again, the sky sent down rain and the earth began to yield its crops.
JAS.5.19	My dear brothers and sisters, if someone among you wanders away from the truth and is brought back, 
JAS.5.20	you can be sure that whoever brings the sinner back from wandering will save that person from death and bring about the forgiveness of many sins.
1PE.1.1	This letter is from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ.
1PE.1.1	I am writing to God’s chosen people who are living as foreigners in the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
1PE.1.2	God the Father knew you and chose you long ago, and his Spirit has made you holy. As a result, you have obeyed him and have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ.
1PE.1.2	May God give you more and more grace and peace.
1PE.1.3	All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is by his great mercy that we have been born again, because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Now we live with great expectation, 
1PE.1.4	and we have a priceless inheritance—an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay. 
1PE.1.5	And through your faith, God is protecting you by his power until you receive this salvation, which is ready to be revealed on the last day for all to see.
1PE.1.6	So be truly glad.
1PE.1.7	These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold—though your faith is far more precious than mere gold. So when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you much praise and glory and honor on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world.
1PE.1.8	You love him even though you have never seen him. Though you do not see him now, you trust him; and you rejoice with a glorious, inexpressible joy. 
1PE.1.9	The reward for trusting him will be the salvation of your souls.
1PE.1.10	This salvation was something even the prophets wanted to know more about when they prophesied about this gracious salvation prepared for you. 
1PE.1.11	They wondered what time or situation the Spirit of Christ within them was talking about when he told them in advance about Christ’s suffering and his great glory afterward.
1PE.1.12	They were told that their messages were not for themselves, but for you. And now this Good News has been announced to you by those who preached in the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. It is all so wonderful that even the angels are eagerly watching these things happen.
1PE.1.13	So prepare your minds for action and exercise self-control. Put all your hope in the gracious salvation that will come to you when Jesus Christ is revealed to the world. 
1PE.1.14	So you must live as God’s obedient children. Don’t slip back into your old ways of living to satisfy your own desires. You didn’t know any better then. 
1PE.1.15	But now you must be holy in everything you do, just as God who chose you is holy. 
1PE.1.16	For the Scriptures say, “You must be holy because I am holy.”
1PE.1.17	And remember that the heavenly Father to whom you pray has no favorites. He will judge or reward you according to what you do. So you must live in reverent fear of him during your time here as “temporary residents.” 
1PE.1.18	For you know that God paid a ransom to save you from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors. And it was not paid with mere gold or silver, which lose their value. 
1PE.1.19	It was the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God. 
1PE.1.20	God chose him as your ransom long before the world began, but now in these last days he has been revealed for your sake.
1PE.1.21	Through Christ you have come to trust in God. And you have placed your faith and hope in God because he raised Christ from the dead and gave him great glory.
1PE.1.22	You were cleansed from your sins when you obeyed the truth, so now you must show sincere love to each other as brothers and sisters.
1PE.1.23	For you have been born again, but not to a life that will quickly end. Your new life will last forever because it comes from the eternal, living word of God. 
1PE.1.24	As the Scriptures say, 
1PE.1.24	“People are like grass;
1PE.1.24	their beauty is like a flower in the field.
1PE.1.24	The grass withers and the flower fades.
1PE.1.25	But the word of the Lord remains forever.”
1PE.1.25	And that word is the Good News that was preached to you.
1PE.2.1	So get rid of all evil behavior. Be done with all deceit, hypocrisy, jealousy, and all unkind speech. 
1PE.2.2	Like newborn babies, you must crave pure spiritual milk so that you will grow into a full experience of salvation. Cry out for this nourishment, 
1PE.2.3	now that you have had a taste of the Lord’s kindness.
1PE.2.4	You are coming to Christ, who is the living cornerstone of God’s temple. He was rejected by people, but he was chosen by God for great honor.
1PE.2.5	And you are living stones that God is building into his spiritual temple. What’s more, you are his holy priests.
1PE.2.6	As the Scriptures say, 
1PE.2.6	“I am placing a cornerstone in Jerusalem,
1PE.2.6	chosen for great honor,
1PE.2.6	and anyone who trusts in him
1PE.2.6	will never be disgraced.”
1PE.2.7	Yes, you who trust him recognize the honor God has given him.
1PE.2.7	“The stone that the builders rejected
1PE.2.7	has now become the cornerstone.”
1PE.2.8	And,
1PE.2.8	“He is the stone that makes people stumble,
1PE.2.8	the rock that makes them fall.”
1PE.2.8	They stumble because they do not obey God’s word, and so they meet the fate that was planned for them.
1PE.2.9	But you are not like that, for you are a chosen people. You are royal priests,
1PE.2.10	“Once you had no identity as a people;
1PE.2.10	now you are God’s people.
1PE.2.10	Once you received no mercy;
1PE.2.10	now you have received God’s mercy.”
1PE.2.11	Dear friends, I warn you as “temporary residents and foreigners” to keep away from worldly desires that wage war against your very souls. 
1PE.2.12	Be careful to live properly among your unbelieving neighbors. Then even if they accuse you of doing wrong, they will see your honorable behavior, and they will give honor to God when he judges the world.
1PE.2.13	For the Lord’s sake, submit to all human authority—whether the king as head of state, 
1PE.2.14	or the officials he has appointed. For the king has sent them to punish those who do wrong and to honor those who do right.
1PE.2.15	It is God’s will that your honorable lives should silence those ignorant people who make foolish accusations against you. 
1PE.2.16	For you are free, yet you are God’s slaves, so don’t use your freedom as an excuse to do evil. 
1PE.2.17	Respect everyone, and love the family of believers.
1PE.2.18	You who are slaves must submit to your masters with all respect.
1PE.2.19	For God is pleased when, conscious of his will, you patiently endure unjust treatment. 
1PE.2.20	Of course, you get no credit for being patient if you are beaten for doing wrong. But if you suffer for doing good and endure it patiently, God is pleased with you.
1PE.2.21	For God called you to do good, even if it means suffering, just as Christ suffered
1PE.2.22	He never sinned,
1PE.2.22	nor ever deceived anyone.
1PE.2.23	He did not retaliate when he was insulted,
1PE.2.23	nor threaten revenge when he suffered.
1PE.2.23	He left his case in the hands of God,
1PE.2.23	who always judges fairly.
1PE.2.24	He personally carried our sins
1PE.2.24	in his body on the cross
1PE.2.24	so that we can be dead to sin
1PE.2.24	and live for what is right.
1PE.2.24	By his wounds
1PE.2.24	you are healed.
1PE.2.25	Once you were like sheep
1PE.2.25	who wandered away.
1PE.2.25	But now you have turned to your Shepherd,
1PE.2.25	the Guardian of your souls.
1PE.3.1	In the same way, you wives must accept the authority of your husbands. Then, even if some refuse to obey the Good News, your godly lives will speak to them without any words. They will be won over 
1PE.3.2	by observing your pure and reverent lives.
1PE.3.3	Don’t be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewelry, or beautiful clothes. 
1PE.3.4	You should clothe yourselves instead with the beauty that comes from within, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is so precious to God. 
1PE.3.5	This is how the holy women of old made themselves beautiful. They put their trust in God and accepted the authority of their husbands. 
1PE.3.6	For instance, Sarah obeyed her husband, Abraham, and called him her master. You are her daughters when you do what is right without fear of what your husbands might do.
1PE.3.7	In the same way, you husbands must give honor to your wives. Treat your wife with understanding as you live together. She may be weaker than you are, but she is your equal partner in God’s gift of new life. Treat her as you should so your prayers will not be hindered.
1PE.3.8	Finally, all of you should be of one mind. Sympathize with each other. Love each other as brothers and sisters.
1PE.3.9	Don’t repay evil for evil. Don’t retaliate with insults when people insult you. Instead, pay them back with a blessing. That is what God has called you to do, and he will grant you his blessing. 
1PE.3.10	For the Scriptures say,
1PE.3.10	“If you want to enjoy life
1PE.3.10	and see many happy days,
1PE.3.10	keep your tongue from speaking evil
1PE.3.10	and your lips from telling lies.
1PE.3.11	Turn away from evil and do good.
1PE.3.11	Search for peace, and work to maintain it.
1PE.3.12	The eyes of the 
1PE.3.12	and his ears are open to their prayers.
1PE.3.12	But the 
1PE.3.12	against those who do evil.”
1PE.3.13	Now, who will want to harm you if you are eager to do good? 
1PE.3.14	But even if you suffer for doing what is right, God will reward you for it. So don’t worry or be afraid of their threats. 
1PE.3.15	Instead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it. 
1PE.3.16	But do this in a gentle and respectful way.
1PE.3.17	Remember, it is better to suffer for doing good, if that is what God wants, than to suffer for doing wrong!
1PE.3.18	Christ suffered
1PE.3.19	So he went and preached to the spirits in prison—
1PE.3.20	those who disobeyed God long ago when God waited patiently while Noah was building his boat. Only eight people were saved from drowning in that terrible flood.
1PE.3.21	And that water is a picture of baptism, which now saves you, not by removing dirt from your body, but as a response to God from
1PE.3.22	Now Christ has gone to heaven. He is seated in the place of honor next to God, and all the angels and authorities and powers accept his authority.
1PE.4.1	So then, since Christ suffered physical pain, you must arm yourselves with the same attitude he had, and be ready to suffer, too. For if you have suffered physically for Christ, you have finished with sin.
1PE.4.2	You won’t spend the rest of your lives chasing your own desires, but you will be anxious to do the will of God. 
1PE.4.3	You have had enough in the past of the evil things that godless people enjoy—their immorality and lust, their feasting and drunkenness and wild parties, and their terrible worship of idols.
1PE.4.4	Of course, your former friends are surprised when you no longer plunge into the flood of wild and destructive things they do. So they slander you. 
1PE.4.5	But remember that they will have to face God, who stands ready to judge everyone, both the living and the dead. 
1PE.4.6	That is why the Good News was preached to those who are now dead
1PE.4.7	The end of the world is coming soon. Therefore, be earnest and disciplined in your prayers. 
1PE.4.8	Most important of all, continue to show deep love for each other, for love covers a multitude of sins. 
1PE.4.9	Cheerfully share your home with those who need a meal or a place to stay.
1PE.4.10	God has given each of you a gift from his great variety of spiritual gifts. Use them well to serve one another. 
1PE.4.11	Do you have the gift of speaking? Then speak as though God himself were speaking through you. Do you have the gift of helping others? Do it with all the strength and energy that God supplies. Then everything you do will bring glory to God through Jesus Christ. All glory and power to him forever and ever! Amen.
1PE.4.12	Dear friends, don’t be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through, as if something strange were happening to you. 
1PE.4.13	Instead, be very glad—for these trials make you partners with Christ in his suffering, so that you will have the wonderful joy of seeing his glory when it is revealed to all the world.
1PE.4.14	If you are insulted because you bear the name of Christ, you will be blessed, for the glorious Spirit of God
1PE.4.15	If you suffer, however, it must not be for murder, stealing, making trouble, or prying into other people’s affairs. 
1PE.4.16	But it is no shame to suffer for being a Christian. Praise God for the privilege of being called by his name! 
1PE.4.17	For the time has come for judgment, and it must begin with God’s household. And if judgment begins with us, what terrible fate awaits those who have never obeyed God’s Good News? 
1PE.4.18	And also, 
1PE.4.18	“If the righteous are barely saved,
1PE.4.18	what will happen to godless sinners?”
1PE.4.19	So if you are suffering in a manner that pleases God, keep on doing what is right, and trust your lives to the God who created you, for he will never fail you.
1PE.5.1	And now, a word to you who are elders in the churches. I, too, am an elder and a witness to the sufferings of Christ. And I, too, will share in his glory when he is revealed to the whole world. As a fellow elder, I appeal to you: 
1PE.5.2	Care for the flock that God has entrusted to you. Watch over it willingly, not grudgingly—not for what you will get out of it, but because you are eager to serve God. 
1PE.5.3	Don’t lord it over the people assigned to your care, but lead them by your own good example. 
1PE.5.4	And when the Great Shepherd appears, you will receive a crown of never-ending glory and honor.
1PE.5.5	In the same way, you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders. And all of you, dress yourselves in humility as you relate to one another, for
1PE.5.5	“God opposes the proud
1PE.5.5	but gives grace to the humble.”
1PE.5.6	So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honor. 
1PE.5.7	Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.
1PE.5.8	Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. 
1PE.5.9	Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that your family of believers
1PE.5.10	In his kindness God called you to share in his eternal glory by means of Christ Jesus. So after you have suffered a little while, he will restore, support, and strengthen you, and he will place you on a firm foundation. 
1PE.5.11	All power to him forever! Amen.
1PE.5.12	I have written and sent this short letter to you with the help of Silas,
1PE.5.13	Your sister church here in Babylon
1PE.5.14	Greet each other with a kiss of love.
1PE.5.14	Peace be with all of you who are in Christ.
2PE.1.1	This letter is from Simon
2PE.1.1	I am writing to you who share the same precious faith we have. This faith was given to you because of the justice and fairness
2PE.1.2	May God give you more and more grace and peace as you grow in your knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord.
2PE.1.3	By his divine power, God has given us everything we need for living a godly life. We have received all of this by coming to know him, the one who called us to himself by means of his marvelous glory and excellence. 
2PE.1.4	And because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and precious promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world’s corruption caused by human desires.
2PE.1.5	In view of all this, make every effort to respond to God’s promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge, 
2PE.1.6	and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness, 
2PE.1.7	and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone.
2PE.1.8	The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2PE.1.9	But those who fail to develop in this way are shortsighted or blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their old sins.
2PE.1.10	So, dear brothers and sisters,
2PE.1.11	Then God will give you a grand entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.12	Therefore, I will always remind you about these things—even though you already know them and are standing firm in the truth you have been taught. 
2PE.1.13	And it is only right that I should keep on reminding you as long as I live.
2PE.1.14	For our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me that I must soon leave this earthly life,
2PE.1.15	so I will work hard to make sure you always remember these things after I am gone.
2PE.1.16	For we were not making up clever stories when we told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We saw his majestic splendor with our own eyes 
2PE.1.17	when he received honor and glory from God the Father. The voice from the majestic glory of God said to him, “This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy.”
2PE.1.18	We ourselves heard that voice from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.
2PE.1.19	Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by the prophets. You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place—until the Day dawns, and Christ the Morning Star shines
2PE.1.20	Above all, you must realize that no prophecy in Scripture ever came from the prophet’s own understanding,
2PE.1.21	or from human initiative. No, those prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit, and they spoke from God.
2PE.2.1	But there were also false prophets in Israel, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will cleverly teach destructive heresies and even deny the Master who bought them. In this way, they will bring sudden destruction on themselves. 
2PE.2.2	Many will follow their evil teaching and shameful immorality. And because of these teachers, the way of truth will be slandered. 
2PE.2.3	In their greed they will make up clever lies to get hold of your money. But God condemned them long ago, and their destruction will not be delayed.
2PE.2.4	For God did not spare even the angels who sinned. He threw them into hell,
2PE.2.5	And God did not spare the ancient world—except for Noah and the seven others in his family. Noah warned the world of God’s righteous judgment. So God protected Noah when he destroyed the world of ungodly people with a vast flood. 
2PE.2.6	Later, God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and turned them into heaps of ashes. He made them an example of what will happen to ungodly people. 
2PE.2.7	But God also rescued Lot out of Sodom because he was a righteous man who was sick of the shameful immorality of the wicked people around him. 
2PE.2.8	Yes, Lot was a righteous man who was tormented in his soul by the wickedness he saw and heard day after day. 
2PE.2.9	So you see, the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials, even while keeping the wicked under punishment until the day of final judgment. 
2PE.2.10	He is especially hard on those who follow their own twisted sexual desire, and who despise authority.
2PE.2.10	These people are proud and arrogant, daring even to scoff at supernatural beings
2PE.2.11	But the angels, who are far greater in power and strength, do not dare to bring from the Lord
2PE.2.12	These false teachers are like unthinking animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed. They scoff at things they do not understand, and like animals, they will be destroyed. 
2PE.2.13	Their destruction is their reward for the harm they have done. They love to indulge in evil pleasures in broad daylight. They are a disgrace and a stain among you. They delight in deception
2PE.2.14	They commit adultery with their eyes, and their desire for sin is never satisfied. They lure unstable people into sin, and they are well trained in greed. They live under God’s curse. 
2PE.2.15	They have wandered off the right road and followed the footsteps of Balaam son of Beor,
2PE.2.16	But Balaam was stopped from his mad course when his donkey rebuked him with a human voice.
2PE.2.17	These people are as useless as dried-up springs or as mist blown away by the wind. They are doomed to blackest darkness. 
2PE.2.18	They brag about themselves with empty, foolish boasting. With an appeal to twisted sexual desires, they lure back into sin those who have barely escaped from a lifestyle of deception. 
2PE.2.19	They promise freedom, but they themselves are slaves of sin and corruption. For you are a slave to whatever controls you. 
2PE.2.20	And when people escape from the wickedness of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and then get tangled up and enslaved by sin again, they are worse off than before. 
2PE.2.21	It would be better if they had never known the way to righteousness than to know it and then reject the command they were given to live a holy life. 
2PE.2.22	They prove the truth of this proverb: “A dog returns to its vomit.”
2PE.3.1	This is my second letter to you, dear friends, and in both of them I have tried to stimulate your wholesome thinking and refresh your memory. 
2PE.3.2	I want you to remember what the holy prophets said long ago and what our Lord and Savior commanded through your apostles.
2PE.3.3	Most importantly, I want to remind you that in the last days scoffers will come, mocking the truth and following their own desires. 
2PE.3.4	They will say, “What happened to the promise that Jesus is coming again? From before the times of our ancestors, everything has remained the same since the world was first created.”
2PE.3.5	They deliberately forget that God made the heavens long ago by the word of his command, and he brought the earth out from the water and surrounded it with water. 
2PE.3.6	Then he used the water to destroy the ancient world with a mighty flood. 
2PE.3.7	And by the same word, the present heavens and earth have been stored up for fire. They are being kept for the day of judgment, when ungodly people will be destroyed.
2PE.3.8	But you must not forget this one thing, dear friends: A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day. 
2PE.3.9	The Lord isn’t really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent. 
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and the very elements themselves will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment.
2PE.3.11	Since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this, what holy and godly lives you should live, 
2PE.3.12	looking forward to the day of God and hurrying it along. On that day, he will set the heavens on fire, and the elements will melt away in the flames. 
2PE.3.13	But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world filled with God’s righteousness.
2PE.3.14	And so, dear friends, while you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.
2PE.3.15	And remember, our Lord’s patience gives people time to be saved. This is what our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom God gave him—
2PE.3.16	speaking of these things in all of his letters. Some of his comments are hard to understand, and those who are ignorant and unstable have twisted his letters to mean something quite different, just as they do with other parts of Scripture. And this will result in their destruction.
2PE.3.17	You already know these things, dear friends. So be on guard; then you will not be carried away by the errors of these wicked people and lose your own secure footing. 
2PE.3.18	Rather, you must grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2PE.3.18	All glory to him, both now and forever! Amen.
1JN.1.1	We proclaim to you the one who existed from the beginning,
1JN.1.2	This one who is life itself was revealed to us, and we have seen him. And now we testify and proclaim to you that he is the one who is eternal life. He was with the Father, and then he was revealed to us. 
1JN.1.3	We proclaim to you what we ourselves have actually seen and heard so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 
1JN.1.4	We are writing these things so that you may fully share our joy.
1JN.1.5	This is the message we heard from Jesus
1JN.1.6	So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness; we are not practicing the truth. 
1JN.1.7	But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
1JN.1.8	If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth. 
1JN.1.9	But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness. 
1JN.1.10	If we claim we have not sinned, we are calling God a liar and showing that his word has no place in our hearts.
1JN.2.1	My dear children, I am writing this to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate who pleads our case before the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the one who is truly righteous. 
1JN.2.2	He himself is the sacrifice that atones for our sins—and not only our sins but the sins of all the world.
1JN.2.3	And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. 
1JN.2.4	If someone claims, “I know God,” but doesn’t obey God’s commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth. 
1JN.2.5	But those who obey God’s word truly show how completely they love him. That is how we know we are living in him. 
1JN.2.6	Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.
1JN.2.7	Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment for you; rather it is an old one you have had from the very beginning. This old commandment—to love one another—is the same message you heard before. 
1JN.2.8	Yet it is also new. Jesus lived the truth of this commandment, and you also are living it. For the darkness is disappearing, and the true light is already shining.
1JN.2.9	If anyone claims, “I am living in the light,” but hates a fellow believer,
1JN.2.10	Anyone who loves a fellow believer
1JN.2.11	But anyone who hates a fellow believer is still living and walking in darkness. Such a person does not know the way to go, having been blinded by the darkness.
1JN.2.12	I am writing to you who are God’s children
1JN.2.12	because your sins have been forgiven through Jesus.
1JN.2.13	I am writing to you who are mature in the faith
1JN.2.13	because you know Christ, who existed from the beginning.
1JN.2.13	I am writing to you who are young in the faith
1JN.2.13	because you have won your battle with the evil one.
1JN.2.14	I have written to you who are God’s children
1JN.2.14	because you know the Father.
1JN.2.14	I have written to you who are mature in the faith
1JN.2.14	because you know Christ, who existed from the beginning.
1JN.2.14	I have written to you who are young in the faith
1JN.2.14	because you are strong.
1JN.2.14	God’s word lives in your hearts,
1JN.2.14	and you have won your battle with the evil one.
1JN.2.15	Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. 
1JN.2.16	For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in our achievements and possessions. These are not from the Father, but are from this world. 
1JN.2.17	And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever.
1JN.2.18	Dear children, the last hour is here. You have heard that the Antichrist is coming, and already many such antichrists have appeared. From this we know that the last hour has come. 
1JN.2.19	These people left our churches, but they never really belonged with us; otherwise they would have stayed with us. When they left, it proved that they did not belong with us.
1JN.2.20	But you are not like that, for the Holy One has given you his Spirit,
1JN.2.21	So I am writing to you not because you don’t know the truth but because you know the difference between truth and lies. 
1JN.2.22	And who is a liar? Anyone who says that Jesus is not the Christ.
1JN.2.23	Anyone who denies the Son doesn’t have the Father, either. But anyone who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
1JN.2.24	So you must remain faithful to what you have been taught from the beginning. If you do, you will remain in fellowship with the Son and with the Father. 
1JN.2.25	And in this fellowship we enjoy the eternal life he promised us.
1JN.2.26	I am writing these things to warn you about those who want to lead you astray. 
1JN.2.27	But you have received the Holy Spirit,
1JN.2.28	And now, dear children, remain in fellowship with Christ so that when he returns, you will be full of courage and not shrink back from him in shame.
1JN.2.29	Since we know that Christ is righteous, we also know that all who do what is right are God’s children.
1JN.3.1	See how very much our Father loves us, for he calls us his children, and that is what we are! But the people who belong to this world don’t recognize that we are God’s children because they don’t know him. 
1JN.3.2	Dear friends, we are already God’s children, but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears. But we do know that we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is. 
1JN.3.3	And all who have this eager expectation will keep themselves pure, just as he is pure.
1JN.3.4	Everyone who sins is breaking God’s law, for all sin is contrary to the law of God. 
1JN.3.5	And you know that Jesus came to take away our sins, and there is no sin in him. 
1JN.3.6	Anyone who continues to live in him will not sin. But anyone who keeps on sinning does not know him or understand who he is.
1JN.3.7	Dear children, don’t let anyone deceive you about this: When people do what is right, it shows that they are righteous, even as Christ is righteous. 
1JN.3.8	But when people keep on sinning, it shows that they belong to the devil, who has been sinning since the beginning. But the Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil. 
1JN.3.9	Those who have been born into God’s family do not make a practice of sinning, because God’s life
1JN.3.10	So now we can tell who are children of God and who are children of the devil. Anyone who does not live righteously and does not love other believers
1JN.3.11	This is the message you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another. 
1JN.3.12	We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because Cain had been doing what was evil, and his brother had been doing what was righteous. 
1JN.3.13	So don’t be surprised, dear brothers and sisters,
1JN.3.14	If we love our brothers and sisters who are believers,
1JN.3.15	Anyone who hates another brother or sister
1JN.3.16	We know what real love is because Jesus gave up his life for us. So we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters. 
1JN.3.17	If someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister
1JN.3.18	Dear children, let’s not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions. 
1JN.3.19	Our actions will show that we belong to the truth, so we will be confident when we stand before God. 
1JN.3.20	Even if we feel guilty, God is greater than our feelings, and he knows everything.
1JN.3.21	Dear friends, if we don’t feel guilty, we can come to God with bold confidence. 
1JN.3.22	And we will receive from him whatever we ask because we obey him and do the things that please him.
1JN.3.23	And this is his commandment: We must believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as he commanded us. 
1JN.3.24	Those who obey God’s commandments remain in fellowship with him, and he with them. And we know he lives in us because the Spirit he gave us lives in us.
1JN.4.1	Dear friends, do not believe everyone who claims to speak by the Spirit. You must test them to see if the spirit they have comes from God. For there are many false prophets in the world. 
1JN.4.2	This is how we know if they have the Spirit of God: If a person claiming to be a prophet
1JN.4.3	But if someone claims to be a prophet and does not acknowledge the truth about Jesus, that person is not from God. Such a person has the spirit of the Antichrist, which you heard is coming into the world and indeed is already here.
1JN.4.4	But you belong to God, my dear children. You have already won a victory over those people, because the Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world. 
1JN.4.5	Those people belong to this world, so they speak from the world’s viewpoint, and the world listens to them. 
1JN.4.6	But we belong to God, and those who know God listen to us. If they do not belong to God, they do not listen to us. That is how we know if someone has the Spirit of truth or the spirit of deception.
1JN.4.7	Dear friends, let us continue to love one another, for love comes from God. Anyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. 
1JN.4.8	But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love.
1JN.4.9	God showed how much he loved us by sending his one and only Son into the world so that we might have eternal life through him. 
1JN.4.10	This is real love—not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins.
1JN.4.11	Dear friends, since God loved us that much, we surely ought to love each other. 
1JN.4.12	No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is brought to full expression in us.
1JN.4.13	And God has given us his Spirit as proof that we live in him and he in us. 
1JN.4.14	Furthermore, we have seen with our own eyes and now testify that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 
1JN.4.15	All who declare that Jesus is the Son of God have God living in them, and they live in God. 
1JN.4.16	We know how much God loves us, and we have put our trust in his love.
1JN.4.16	God is love, and all who live in love live in God, and God lives in them. 
1JN.4.17	And as we live in God, our love grows more perfect. So we will not be afraid on the day of judgment, but we can face him with confidence because we live like Jesus here in this world.
1JN.4.18	Such love has no fear, because perfect love expels all fear. If we are afraid, it is for fear of punishment, and this shows that we have not fully experienced his perfect love. 
1JN.4.19	We love each other
1JN.4.20	If someone says, “I love God,” but hates a fellow believer,
1JN.4.21	And he has given us this command: Those who love God must also love their fellow believers.
1JN.5.1	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ
1JN.5.2	We know we love God’s children if we love God and obey his commandments. 
1JN.5.3	Loving God means keeping his commandments, and his commandments are not burdensome. 
1JN.5.4	For every child of God defeats this evil world, and we achieve this victory through our faith. 
1JN.5.5	And who can win this battle against the world? Only those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.
1JN.5.6	And Jesus Christ was revealed as God’s Son by his baptism in water and by shedding his blood on the cross
1JN.5.7	So we have these three witnesses
1JN.5.8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood—and all three agree. 
1JN.5.9	Since we believe human testimony, surely we can believe the greater testimony that comes from God. And God has testified about his Son. 
1JN.5.10	All who believe in the Son of God know in their hearts that this testimony is true. Those who don’t believe this are actually calling God a liar because they don’t believe what God has testified about his Son.
1JN.5.11	And this is what God has testified: He has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
1JN.5.12	Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have God’s Son does not have life.
1JN.5.13	I have written this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know you have eternal life. 
1JN.5.14	And we are confident that he hears us whenever we ask for anything that pleases him. 
1JN.5.15	And since we know he hears us when we make our requests, we also know that he will give us what we ask for.
1JN.5.16	If you see a fellow believer
1JN.5.17	All wicked actions are sin, but not every sin leads to death.
1JN.5.18	We know that God’s children do not make a practice of sinning, for God’s Son holds them securely, and the evil one cannot touch them. 
1JN.5.19	We know that we are children of God and that the world around us is under the control of the evil one.
1JN.5.20	And we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us understanding so that we can know the true God.
1JN.5.21	Dear children, keep away from anything that might take God’s place in your hearts.
2JN.1.1	This letter is from John, the elder.
2JN.1.1	I am writing to the chosen lady and to her children,
2JN.1.2	because the truth lives in us and will be with us forever.
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy, and peace, which come from God the Father and from Jesus Christ—the Son of the Father—will continue to be with us who live in truth and love.
2JN.1.4	How happy I was to meet some of your children and find them living according to the truth, just as the Father commanded.
2JN.1.5	I am writing to remind you, dear friends,
2JN.1.6	Love means doing what God has commanded us, and he has commanded us to love one another, just as you heard from the beginning.
2JN.1.7	I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world. They deny that Jesus Christ came
2JN.1.8	Watch out that you do not lose what we
2JN.1.9	Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God. But anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both the Father and the Son.
2JN.1.10	If anyone comes to your meeting and does not teach the truth about Christ, don’t invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement. 
2JN.1.11	Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work.
2JN.1.12	I have much more to say to you, but I don’t want to do it with paper and ink. For I hope to visit you soon and talk with you face to face. Then our joy will be complete.
2JN.1.13	Greetings from the children of your sister,
3JN.1.1	This letter is from John, the elder.
3JN.1.1	I am writing to Gaius, my dear friend, whom I love in the truth.
3JN.1.2	Dear friend, I hope all is well with you and that you are as healthy in body as you are strong in spirit. 
3JN.1.3	Some of the traveling teachers
3JN.1.4	I could have no greater joy than to hear that my children are following the truth.
3JN.1.5	Dear friend, you are being faithful to God when you care for the traveling teachers who pass through, even though they are strangers to you. 
3JN.1.6	They have told the church here of your loving friendship. Please continue providing for such teachers in a manner that pleases God. 
3JN.1.7	For they are traveling for the Lord,
3JN.1.8	So we ourselves should support them so that we can be their partners as they teach the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote to the church about this, but Diotrephes, who loves to be the leader, refuses to have anything to do with us. 
3JN.1.10	When I come, I will report some of the things he is doing and the evil accusations he is making against us. Not only does he refuse to welcome the traveling teachers, he also tells others not to help them. And when they do help, he puts them out of the church.
3JN.1.11	Dear friend, don’t let this bad example influence you. Follow only what is good. Remember that those who do good prove that they are God’s children, and those who do evil prove that they do not know God.
3JN.1.12	Everyone speaks highly of Demetrius, as does the truth itself. We ourselves can say the same for him, and you know we speak the truth.
3JN.1.13	I have much more to say to you, but I don’t want to write it with pen and ink. 
3JN.1.14	For I hope to see you soon, and then we will talk face to face.
3JN.1.15	Peace be with you.
3JN.1.15	Your friends here send you their greetings. Please give my personal greetings to each of our friends there.
JUD.1.1	This letter is from Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ and a brother of James.
JUD.1.1	I am writing to all who have been called by God the Father, who loves you and keeps you safe in the care of Jesus Christ.
JUD.1.2	May God give you more and more mercy, peace, and love.
JUD.1.3	Dear friends, I had been eagerly planning to write to you about the salvation we all share. But now I find that I must write about something else, urging you to defend the faith that God has entrusted once for all time to his holy people. 
JUD.1.4	I say this because some ungodly people have wormed their way into your churches, saying that God’s marvelous grace allows us to live immoral lives. The condemnation of such people was recorded long ago, for they have denied our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
JUD.1.5	So I want to remind you, though you already know these things, that Jesus
JUD.1.6	And I remind you of the angels who did not stay within the limits of authority God gave them but left the place where they belonged. God has kept them securely chained in prisons of darkness, waiting for the great day of judgment. 
JUD.1.7	And don’t forget Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns, which were filled with immorality and every kind of sexual perversion. Those cities were destroyed by fire and serve as a warning of the eternal fire of God’s judgment.
JUD.1.8	In the same way, these people—who claim authority from their dreams—live immoral lives, defy authority, and scoff at supernatural beings.
JUD.1.9	But even Michael, one of the mightiest of the angels,
JUD.1.10	But these people scoff at things they do not understand. Like unthinking animals, they do whatever their instincts tell them, and so they bring about their own destruction. 
JUD.1.11	What sorrow awaits them! For they follow in the footsteps of Cain, who killed his brother. Like Balaam, they deceive people for money. And like Korah, they perish in their rebellion.
JUD.1.12	When these people eat with you in your fellowship meals commemorating the Lord’s love, they are like dangerous reefs that can shipwreck you.
JUD.1.13	They are like wild waves of the sea, churning up the foam of their shameful deeds. They are like wandering stars, doomed forever to blackest darkness.
JUD.1.14	Enoch, who lived in the seventh generation after Adam, prophesied about these people. He said, “Listen! The Lord is coming with countless thousands of his holy ones 
JUD.1.15	to execute judgment on the people of the world. He will convict every person of all the ungodly things they have done and for all the insults that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”
JUD.1.16	These people are grumblers and complainers, living only to satisfy their desires. They brag loudly about themselves, and they flatter others to get what they want.
JUD.1.17	But you, my dear friends, must remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ predicted. 
JUD.1.18	They told you that in the last times there would be scoffers whose purpose in life is to satisfy their ungodly desires. 
JUD.1.19	These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They follow their natural instincts because they do not have God’s Spirit in them.
JUD.1.20	But you, dear friends, must build each other up in your most holy faith, pray in the power of the Holy Spirit,
JUD.1.21	and await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will bring you eternal life. In this way, you will keep yourselves safe in God’s love.
JUD.1.22	And you must show mercy to
JUD.1.23	Rescue others by snatching them from the flames of judgment. Show mercy to still others,
JUD.1.24	Now all glory to God, who is able to keep you from falling away and will bring you with great joy into his glorious presence without a single fault. 
JUD.1.25	All glory to him who alone is God, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord. All glory, majesty, power, and authority are his before all time, and in the present, and beyond all time! Amen.
REV.1.1	This is a revelation from
REV.1.2	who faithfully reported everything he saw. This is his report of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
REV.1.3	God blesses the one who reads the words of this prophecy to the church, and he blesses all who listen to its message and obey what it says, for the time is near.
REV.1.4	This letter is from John to the seven churches in the province of Asia.
REV.1.4	Grace and peace to you from the one who is, who always was, and who is still to come; from the sevenfold Spirit
REV.1.5	and from Jesus Christ. He is the faithful witness to these things, the first to rise from the dead, and the ruler of all the kings of the world.
REV.1.5	All glory to him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by shedding his blood for us. 
REV.1.6	He has made us a Kingdom of priests for God his Father. All glory and power to him forever and ever! Amen.
REV.1.7	Look! He comes with the clouds of heaven.
REV.1.7	And everyone will see him—
REV.1.7	even those who pierced him.
REV.1.7	And all the nations of the world
REV.1.7	will mourn for him.
REV.1.7	Yes! Amen!
REV.1.8	“I am the Alpha and the Omega—the beginning and the end,”
REV.1.9	I, John, am your brother and your partner in suffering and in God’s Kingdom and in the patient endurance to which Jesus calls us. I was exiled to the island of Patmos for preaching the word of God and for my testimony about Jesus. 
REV.1.10	It was the Lord’s Day, and I was worshiping in the Spirit.
REV.1.11	It said, 
REV.1.12	When I turned to see who was speaking to me, I saw seven gold lampstands. 
REV.1.13	And standing in the middle of the lampstands was someone like the Son of Man.
REV.1.14	His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow. And his eyes were like flames of fire. 
REV.1.15	His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice thundered like mighty ocean waves. 
REV.1.16	He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp two-edged sword came from his mouth. And his face was like the sun in all its brilliance.
REV.1.17	When I saw him, I fell at his feet as if I were dead. But he laid his right hand on me and said, 
REV.4.1	Then as I looked, I saw a door standing open in heaven, and the same voice I had heard before spoke to me like a trumpet blast. The voice said, 
REV.4.2	And instantly I was in the Spirit,
REV.4.3	The one sitting on the throne was as brilliant as gemstones—like jasper and carnelian. And the glow of an emerald circled his throne like a rainbow. 
REV.4.4	Twenty-four thrones surrounded him, and twenty-four elders sat on them. They were all clothed in white and had gold crowns on their heads. 
REV.4.5	From the throne came flashes of lightning and the rumble of thunder. And in front of the throne were seven torches with burning flames. This is the sevenfold Spirit
REV.4.6	In front of the throne was a shiny sea of glass, sparkling like crystal.
REV.4.6	In the center and around the throne were four living beings, each covered with eyes, front and back. 
REV.4.7	The first of these living beings was like a lion; the second was like an ox; the third had a human face; and the fourth was like an eagle in flight. 
REV.4.8	Each of these living beings had six wings, and their wings were covered all over with eyes, inside and out. Day after day and night after night they keep on saying,
REV.4.8	“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty—
REV.4.8	the one who always was, who is, and who is still to come.”
REV.4.9	Whenever the living beings give glory and honor and thanks to the one sitting on the throne (the one who lives forever and ever), 
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders fall down and worship the one sitting on the throne (the one who lives forever and ever). And they lay their crowns before the throne and say,
REV.4.11	“You are worthy, O Lord our God,
REV.4.11	to receive glory and honor and power.
REV.4.11	For you created all things,
REV.4.11	and they exist because you created what you pleased.”
REV.5.1	Then I saw a scroll
REV.5.2	And I saw a strong angel, who shouted with a loud voice: “Who is worthy to break the seals on this scroll and open it?” 
REV.5.3	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll and read it.
REV.5.4	Then I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll and read it. 
REV.5.5	But one of the twenty-four elders said to me, “Stop weeping! Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the heir to David’s throne,
REV.5.6	Then I saw a Lamb that looked as if it had been slaughtered, but it was now standing between the throne and the four living beings and among the twenty-four elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the sevenfold Spirit
REV.5.7	He stepped forward and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne. 
REV.5.8	And when he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp, and they held gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of God’s people. 
REV.5.9	And they sang a new song with these words:
REV.5.9	“You are worthy to take the scroll
REV.5.9	and break its seals and open it.
REV.5.9	For you were slaughtered, and your blood has ransomed people for God
REV.5.9	from every tribe and language and people and nation.
REV.5.10	And you have caused them to become
REV.5.10	a Kingdom of priests for our God.
REV.5.10	And they will reign
REV.5.11	Then I looked again, and I heard the voices of thousands and millions of angels around the throne and of the living beings and the elders. 
REV.5.12	And they sang in a mighty chorus:
REV.5.12	“Worthy is the Lamb who was slaughtered—
REV.5.12	to receive power and riches
REV.5.12	and wisdom and strength
REV.5.12	and honor and glory and blessing.”
REV.5.13	And then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea. They sang:
REV.5.13	“Blessing and honor and glory and power
REV.5.13	belong to the one sitting on the throne
REV.5.13	and to the Lamb forever and ever.”
REV.5.14	And the four living beings said, “Amen!” And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped the Lamb.
REV.6.1	As I watched, the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals on the scroll.
REV.6.2	I looked up and saw a white horse standing there. Its rider carried a bow, and a crown was placed on his head. He rode out to win many battles and gain the victory.
REV.6.3	When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second living being say, “Come!” 
REV.6.4	Then another horse appeared, a red one. Its rider was given a mighty sword and the authority to take peace from the earth. And there was war and slaughter everywhere.
REV.6.5	When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, “Come!” I looked up and saw a black horse, and its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. 
REV.6.6	And I heard a voice from among the four living beings say, “A loaf of wheat bread or three loaves of barley will cost a day’s pay.
REV.6.7	When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living being say, “Come!” 
REV.6.8	I looked up and saw a horse whose color was pale green. Its rider was named Death, and his companion was the Grave.
REV.6.9	When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of all who had been martyred for the word of God and for being faithful in their testimony. 
REV.6.10	They shouted to the Lord and said, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you judge the people who belong to this world and avenge our blood for what they have done to us?” 
REV.6.11	Then a white robe was given to each of them. And they were told to rest a little longer until the full number of their brothers and sisters
REV.6.12	I watched as the Lamb broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became as dark as black cloth, and the moon became as red as blood. 
REV.6.13	Then the stars of the sky fell to the earth like green figs falling from a tree shaken by a strong wind. 
REV.6.14	The sky was rolled up like a scroll, and all of the mountains and islands were moved from their places.
REV.6.15	Then everyone—the kings of the earth, the rulers, the generals, the wealthy, the powerful, and every slave and free person—all hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains. 
REV.6.16	And they cried to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb. 
REV.6.17	For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to survive?”
REV.7.1	Then I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds so they did not blow on the earth or the sea, or even on any tree. 
REV.7.2	And I saw another angel coming up from the east, carrying the seal of the living God. And he shouted to those four angels, who had been given power to harm land and sea, 
REV.7.3	“Wait! Don’t harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have placed the seal of God on the foreheads of his servants.”
REV.7.4	And I heard how many were marked with the seal of God—144,000 were sealed from all the tribes of Israel:
REV.7.5	from Judah
REV.7.5	12,000
REV.7.5	from Reuben
REV.7.5	12,000
REV.7.5	from Gad
REV.7.5	12,000
REV.7.6	from Asher
REV.7.6	12,000
REV.7.6	from Naphtali
REV.7.6	12,000
REV.7.6	from Manasseh
REV.7.6	12,000
REV.7.7	from Simeon
REV.7.7	12,000
REV.7.7	from Levi
REV.7.7	12,000
REV.7.7	from Issachar
REV.7.7	12,000
REV.7.8	from Zebulun
REV.7.8	12,000
REV.7.8	from Joseph
REV.7.8	12,000
REV.7.8	from Benjamin
REV.7.8	12,000
REV.7.9	After this I saw a vast crowd, too great to count, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing in front of the throne and before the Lamb. They were clothed in white robes and held palm branches in their hands. 
REV.7.10	And they were shouting with a great roar,
REV.7.10	“Salvation comes from our God who sits on the throne
REV.7.10	and from the Lamb!”
REV.7.11	And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living beings. And they fell before the throne with their faces to the ground and worshiped God. 
REV.7.12	They sang,
REV.7.12	“Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom
REV.7.12	and thanksgiving and honor
REV.7.12	and power and strength belong to our God
REV.7.12	forever and ever! Amen.”
REV.7.13	Then one of the twenty-four elders asked me, “Who are these who are clothed in white? Where did they come from?”
REV.7.14	And I said to him, “Sir, you are the one who knows.”
REV.7.14	Then he said to me, “These are the ones who died in
REV.7.15	“That is why they stand in front of God’s throne
REV.7.15	and serve him day and night in his Temple.
REV.7.15	And he who sits on the throne
REV.7.15	will give them shelter.
REV.7.16	They will never again be hungry or thirsty;
REV.7.16	they will never be scorched by the heat of the sun.
REV.7.17	For the Lamb on the throne
REV.7.17	will be their Shepherd.
REV.7.17	He will lead them to springs of life-giving water.
REV.7.17	And God will wipe every tear from their eyes.”
REV.8.1	When the Lamb broke the seventh seal on the scroll,
REV.8.2	I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and they were given seven trumpets.
REV.8.3	Then another angel with a gold incense burner came and stood at the altar. And a great amount of incense was given to him to mix with the prayers of God’s people as an offering on the gold altar before the throne. 
REV.8.4	The smoke of the incense, mixed with the prayers of God’s holy people, ascended up to God from the altar where the angel had poured them out. 
REV.8.5	Then the angel filled the incense burner with fire from the altar and threw it down upon the earth; and thunder crashed, lightning flashed, and there was a terrible earthquake.
REV.8.6	Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow their mighty blasts.
REV.8.7	The first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth. One-third of the earth was set on fire, one-third of the trees were burned, and all the green grass was burned.
REV.8.8	Then the second angel blew his trumpet, and a great mountain of fire was thrown into the sea. One-third of the water in the sea became blood, 
REV.8.9	one-third of all things living in the sea died, and one-third of all the ships on the sea were destroyed.
REV.8.10	Then the third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch. It fell on one-third of the rivers and on the springs of water. 
REV.8.11	The name of the star was Bitterness.
REV.8.12	Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet, and one-third of the sun was struck, and one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars, and they became dark. And one-third of the day was dark, and also one-third of the night.
REV.8.13	Then I looked, and I heard a single eagle crying loudly as it flew through the air, “Terror, terror, terror to all who belong to this world because of what will happen when the last three angels blow their trumpets.”
REV.9.1	Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.
REV.9.2	When he opened it, smoke poured out as though from a huge furnace, and the sunlight and air turned dark from the smoke.
REV.9.3	Then locusts came from the smoke and descended on the earth, and they were given power to sting like scorpions. 
REV.9.4	They were told not to harm the grass or plants or trees, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 
REV.9.5	They were told not to kill them but to torture them for five months with pain like the pain of a scorpion sting. 
REV.9.6	In those days people will seek death but will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them!
REV.9.7	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. They had what looked like gold crowns on their heads, and their faces looked like human faces. 
REV.9.8	They had hair like women’s hair and teeth like the teeth of a lion. 
REV.9.9	They wore armor made of iron, and their wings roared like an army of chariots rushing into battle. 
REV.9.10	They had tails that stung like scorpions, and for five months they had the power to torment people. 
REV.9.11	Their king is the angel from the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is 
REV.9.12	The first terror is past, but look, two more terrors are coming!
REV.9.13	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice speaking from the four horns of the gold altar that stands in the presence of God. 
REV.9.14	And the voice said to the sixth angel who held the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great Euphrates River.” 
REV.9.15	Then the four angels who had been prepared for this hour and day and month and year were turned loose to kill one-third of all the people on earth. 
REV.9.16	I heard the size of their army, which was 200 million mounted troops.
REV.9.17	And in my vision, I saw the horses and the riders sitting on them. The riders wore armor that was fiery red and dark blue and yellow. The horses had heads like lions, and fire and smoke and burning sulfur billowed from their mouths. 
REV.9.18	One-third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues—by the fire and smoke and burning sulfur that came from the mouths of the horses. 
REV.9.19	Their power was in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails had heads like snakes, with the power to injure people.
REV.9.20	But the people who did not die in these plagues still refused to repent of their evil deeds and turn to God. They continued to worship demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—idols that can neither see nor hear nor walk! 
REV.9.21	And they did not repent of their murders or their witchcraft or their sexual immorality or their thefts.
REV.10.1	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, surrounded by a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face shone like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire. 
REV.10.2	And in his hand was a small scroll
REV.10.3	And he gave a great shout like the roar of a lion. And when he shouted, the seven thunders answered.
REV.10.4	When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Keep secret
REV.10.5	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward heaven. 
REV.10.6	He swore an oath in the name of the one who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and everything in them, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. He said, “There will be no more delay. 
REV.10.7	When the seventh angel blows his trumpet, God’s mysterious plan will be fulfilled. It will happen just as he announced it to his servants the prophets.”
REV.10.8	Then the voice from heaven spoke to me again: “Go and take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”
REV.10.9	So I went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll. “Yes, take it and eat it,” he said. “It will be sweet as honey in your mouth, but it will turn sour in your stomach!” 
REV.10.10	So I took the small scroll from the hand of the angel, and I ate it! It was sweet in my mouth, but when I swallowed it, it turned sour in my stomach.
REV.10.11	Then I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”
REV.11.1	Then I was given a measuring stick, and I was told, “Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the number of worshipers. 
REV.11.2	But do not measure the outer courtyard, for it has been turned over to the nations. They will trample the holy city for 42 months. 
REV.11.3	And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will be clothed in burlap and will prophesy during those 1,260 days.”
REV.11.4	These two prophets are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of all the earth. 
REV.11.5	If anyone tries to harm them, fire flashes from their mouths and consumes their enemies. This is how anyone who tries to harm them must die. 
REV.11.6	They have power to shut the sky so that no rain will fall for as long as they prophesy. And they have the power to turn the rivers and oceans into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish.
REV.11.7	When they complete their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the bottomless pit
REV.11.8	And their bodies will lie in the main street of Jerusalem,
REV.11.9	And for three and a half days, all peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will stare at their bodies. No one will be allowed to bury them. 
REV.11.10	All the people who belong to this world will gloat over them and give presents to each other to celebrate the death of the two prophets who had tormented them.
REV.11.11	But after three and a half days, God breathed life into them, and they stood up! Terror struck all who were staring at them. 
REV.11.12	Then a loud voice from heaven called to the two prophets, “Come up here!” And they rose to heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched.
REV.11.13	At the same time there was a terrible earthquake that destroyed a tenth of the city. Seven thousand people died in that earthquake, and everyone else was terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	The second terror is past, but look, the third terror is coming quickly.
REV.11.15	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices shouting in heaven:
REV.11.15	“The world has now become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,
REV.11.15	and he will reign forever and ever.”
REV.11.16	The twenty-four elders sitting on their thrones before God fell with their faces to the ground and worshiped him. 
REV.11.17	And they said,
REV.11.17	“We give thanks to you, Lord God, the Almighty,
REV.11.17	the one who is and who always was,
REV.11.17	for now you have assumed your great power
REV.11.17	and have begun to reign.
REV.11.18	The nations were filled with wrath,
REV.11.18	but now the time of your wrath has come.
REV.11.18	It is time to judge the dead
REV.11.18	and reward your servants the prophets,
REV.11.18	as well as your holy people,
REV.11.18	and all who fear your name,
REV.11.18	from the least to the greatest.
REV.11.18	It is time to destroy
REV.11.18	all who have caused destruction on the earth.”
REV.11.19	Then, in heaven, the Temple of God was opened and the Ark of his covenant could be seen inside the Temple. Lightning flashed, thunder crashed and roared, and there was an earthquake and a terrible hailstorm.
REV.12.1	Then I witnessed in heaven an event of great significance. I saw a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon beneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 
REV.12.2	She was pregnant, and she cried out because of her labor pains and the agony of giving birth.
REV.12.3	Then I witnessed in heaven another significant event. I saw a large red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, with seven crowns on his heads. 
REV.12.4	His tail swept away one-third of the stars in the sky, and he threw them to the earth. He stood in front of the woman as she was about to give birth, ready to devour her baby as soon as it was born.
REV.12.5	She gave birth to a son who was to rule all nations with an iron rod. And her child was snatched away from the dragon and was caught up to God and to his throne. 
REV.12.6	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place to care for her for 1,260 days.
REV.12.7	Then there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels. 
REV.12.8	And the dragon lost the battle, and he and his angels were forced out of heaven. 
REV.12.9	This great dragon—the ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, the one deceiving the whole world—was thrown down to the earth with all his angels.
REV.12.10	Then I heard a loud voice shouting across the heavens,
REV.12.10	“It has come at last—
REV.12.10	salvation and power
REV.12.10	and the Kingdom of our God,
REV.12.10	and the authority of his Christ.
REV.12.10	For the accuser of our brothers and sisters
REV.12.10	has been thrown down to earth—
REV.12.10	the one who accuses them
REV.12.10	before our God day and night.
REV.12.11	And they have defeated him by the blood of the Lamb
REV.12.11	and by their testimony.
REV.12.11	And they did not love their lives so much
REV.12.11	that they were afraid to die.
REV.12.12	Therefore, rejoice, O heavens!
REV.12.12	And you who live in the heavens, rejoice!
REV.12.12	But terror will come on the earth and the sea,
REV.12.12	for the devil has come down to you in great anger,
REV.12.12	knowing that he has little time.”
REV.12.13	When the dragon realized that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 
REV.12.14	But she was given two wings like those of a great eagle so she could fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness. There she would be cared for and protected from the dragon
REV.12.15	Then the dragon tried to drown the woman with a flood of water that flowed from his mouth. 
REV.12.16	But the earth helped her by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that gushed out from the mouth of the dragon. 
REV.12.17	And the dragon was angry at the woman and declared war against the rest of her children—all who keep God’s commandments and maintain their testimony for Jesus.
REV.12.18	Then the dragon took his stand
REV.13.1	Then I saw a beast rising up out of the sea. It had seven heads and ten horns, with ten crowns on its horns. And written on each head were names that blasphemed God. 
REV.13.2	This beast looked like a leopard, but it had the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion! And the dragon gave the beast his own power and throne and great authority.
REV.13.3	I saw that one of the heads of the beast seemed wounded beyond recovery—but the fatal wound was healed! The whole world marveled at this miracle and gave allegiance to the beast. 
REV.13.4	They worshiped the dragon for giving the beast such power, and they also worshiped the beast. “Who is as great as the beast?” they exclaimed. “Who is able to fight against him?”
REV.13.5	Then the beast was allowed to speak great blasphemies against God. And he was given authority to do whatever he wanted for forty-two months. 
REV.13.6	And he spoke terrible words of blasphemy against God, slandering his name and his dwelling—that is, those who dwell in heaven.
REV.13.7	And the beast was allowed to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And he was given authority to rule over every tribe and people and language and nation. 
REV.13.8	And all the people who belong to this world worshiped the beast. They are the ones whose names were not written in the Book of Life that belongs to the Lamb who was slaughtered before the world was made.
REV.13.9	Anyone with ears to hear
REV.13.9	should listen and understand.
REV.13.10	Anyone who is destined for prison
REV.13.10	will be taken to prison.
REV.13.10	Anyone destined to die by the sword
REV.13.10	will die by the sword.
REV.13.10	This means that God’s holy people must endure persecution patiently and remain faithful.
REV.13.11	Then I saw another beast come up out of the earth. He had two horns like those of a lamb, but he spoke with the voice of a dragon. 
REV.13.12	He exercised all the authority of the first beast. And he required all the earth and its people to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. 
REV.13.13	He did astounding miracles, even making fire flash down to earth from the sky while everyone was watching. 
REV.13.14	And with all the miracles he was allowed to perform on behalf of the first beast, he deceived all the people who belong to this world. He ordered the people to make a great statue of the first beast, who was fatally wounded and then came back to life. 
REV.13.15	He was then permitted to give life to this statue so that it could speak. Then the statue of the beast commanded that anyone refusing to worship it must die.
REV.13.16	He required everyone—small and great, rich and poor, free and slave—to be given a mark on the right hand or on the forehead. 
REV.13.17	And no one could buy or sell anything without that mark, which was either the name of the beast or the number representing his name. 
REV.13.18	Wisdom is needed here. Let the one with understanding solve the meaning of the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.
REV.14.1	Then I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. 
REV.14.2	And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of mighty ocean waves or the rolling of loud thunder. It was like the sound of many harpists playing together.
REV.14.3	This great choir sang a wonderful new song in front of the throne of God and before the four living beings and the twenty-four elders. No one could learn this song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. 
REV.14.4	They have kept themselves as pure as virgins,
REV.14.5	They have told no lies; they are without blame.
REV.14.6	And I saw another angel flying through the sky, carrying the eternal Good News to proclaim to the people who belong to this world—to every nation, tribe, language, and people. 
REV.14.7	“Fear God,” he shouted. “Give glory to him. For the time has come when he will sit as judge. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all the springs of water.”
REV.14.8	Then another angel followed him through the sky, shouting, “Babylon is fallen—that great city is fallen—because she made all the nations of the world drink the wine of her passionate immorality.”
REV.14.9	Then a third angel followed them, shouting, “Anyone who worships the beast and his statue or who accepts his mark on the forehead or on the hand 
REV.14.10	must drink the wine of God’s anger. It has been poured full strength into God’s cup of wrath. And they will be tormented with fire and burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb. 
REV.14.11	The smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or night, for they have worshiped the beast and his statue and have accepted the mark of his name.”
REV.14.12	This means that God’s holy people must endure persecution patiently, obeying his commands and maintaining their faith in Jesus.
REV.14.13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this down: Blessed are those who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, they are blessed indeed, for they will rest from their hard work; for their good deeds follow them!”
REV.14.14	Then I saw a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was someone like the Son of Man.
REV.14.15	Then another angel came from the Temple and shouted to the one sitting on the cloud, “Swing the sickle, for the time of harvest has come; the crop on earth is ripe.” 
REV.14.16	So the one sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the whole earth was harvested.
REV.14.17	After that, another angel came from the Temple in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	Then another angel, who had power to destroy with fire, came from the altar. He shouted to the angel with the sharp sickle, “Swing your sickle now to gather the clusters of grapes from the vines of the earth, for they are ripe for judgment.” 
REV.14.19	So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and loaded the grapes into the great winepress of God’s wrath. 
REV.14.20	The grapes were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress in a stream about 180 miles
REV.15.1	Then I saw in heaven another marvelous event of great significance. Seven angels were holding the seven last plagues, which would bring God’s wrath to completion. 
REV.15.2	I saw before me what seemed to be a glass sea mixed with fire. And on it stood all the people who had been victorious over the beast and his statue and the number representing his name. They were all holding harps that God had given them. 
REV.15.3	And they were singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb:
REV.15.3	“Great and marvelous are your works,
REV.15.3	O Lord God, the Almighty.
REV.15.3	Just and true are your ways,
REV.15.3	O King of the nations.
REV.15.4	Who will not fear you, Lord,
REV.15.4	and glorify your name?
REV.15.4	For you alone are holy.
REV.15.4	All nations will come and worship before you,
REV.15.4	for your righteous deeds have been revealed.”
REV.15.5	Then I looked and saw that the Temple in heaven, God’s Tabernacle, was thrown wide open. 
REV.15.6	The seven angels who were holding the seven plagues came out of the Temple. They were clothed in spotless white linen
REV.15.7	Then one of the four living beings handed each of the seven angels a gold bowl filled with the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. 
REV.15.8	The Temple was filled with smoke from God’s glory and power. No one could enter the Temple until the seven angels had completed pouring out the seven plagues.
REV.16.1	Then I heard a mighty voice from the Temple say to the seven angels, “Go your ways and pour out on the earth the seven bowls containing God’s wrath.”
REV.16.2	So the first angel left the Temple and poured out his bowl on the earth, and horrible, malignant sores broke out on everyone who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his statue.
REV.16.3	Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse. And everything in the sea died.
REV.16.4	Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs, and they became blood. 
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel who had authority over all water saying,
REV.16.5	“You are just, O Holy One, who is and who always was,
REV.16.5	because you have sent these judgments.
REV.16.6	Since they shed the blood
REV.16.6	of your holy people and your prophets,
REV.16.6	you have given them blood to drink.
REV.16.6	It is their just reward.”
REV.16.7	And I heard a voice from the altar,
REV.16.7	“Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty,
REV.16.7	your judgments are true and just.”
REV.16.8	Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, causing it to scorch everyone with its fire. 
REV.16.9	Everyone was burned by this blast of heat, and they cursed the name of God, who had control over all these plagues. They did not repent of their sins and turn to God and give him glory.
REV.16.10	Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. His subjects ground their teeth
REV.16.11	and they cursed the God of heaven for their pains and sores. But they did not repent of their evil deeds and turn to God.
REV.16.12	Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great Euphrates River, and it dried up so that the kings from the east could march their armies toward the west without hindrance. 
REV.16.13	And I saw three evil
REV.16.14	They are demonic spirits who work miracles and go out to all the rulers of the world to gather them for battle against the Lord on that great judgment day of God the Almighty.
REV.16.16	And the demonic spirits gathered all the rulers and their armies to a place with the Hebrew name 
REV.16.17	Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. And a mighty shout came from the throne in the Temple, saying, “It is finished!” 
REV.16.18	Then the thunder crashed and rolled, and lightning flashed. And a great earthquake struck—the worst since people were placed on the earth. 
REV.16.19	The great city of Babylon split into three sections, and the cities of many nations fell into heaps of rubble. So God remembered all of Babylon’s sins, and he made her drink the cup that was filled with the wine of his fierce wrath. 
REV.16.20	And every island disappeared, and all the mountains were leveled. 
REV.16.21	There was a terrible hailstorm, and hailstones weighing as much as seventy-five pounds
REV.17.1	One of the seven angels who had poured out the seven bowls came over and spoke to me. “Come with me,” he said, “and I will show you the judgment that is going to come on the great prostitute, who rules over many waters. 
REV.17.2	The kings of the world have committed adultery with her, and the people who belong to this world have been made drunk by the wine of her immorality.”
REV.17.3	So the angel took me in the Spirit
REV.17.4	The woman wore purple and scarlet clothing and beautiful jewelry made of gold and precious gems and pearls. In her hand she held a gold goblet full of obscenities and the impurities of her immorality. 
REV.17.5	A mysterious name was written on her forehead: “Babylon the Great, Mother of All Prostitutes and Obscenities in the World.” 
REV.17.6	I could see that she was drunk—drunk with the blood of God’s holy people who were witnesses for Jesus. I stared at her in complete amazement.
REV.17.7	“Why are you so amazed?” the angel asked. “I will tell you the mystery of this woman and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns on which she sits. 
REV.17.8	The beast you saw was once alive but isn’t now. And yet he will soon come up out of the bottomless pit
REV.17.9	“This calls for a mind with understanding: The seven heads of the beast represent the seven hills where the woman rules. They also represent seven kings. 
REV.17.10	Five kings have already fallen, the sixth now reigns, and the seventh is yet to come, but his reign will be brief.
REV.17.11	“The scarlet beast that was, but is no longer, is the eighth king. He is like the other seven, and he, too, is headed for destruction. 
REV.17.12	The ten horns of the beast are ten kings who have not yet risen to power. They will be appointed to their kingdoms for one brief moment to reign with the beast. 
REV.17.13	They will all agree to give him their power and authority. 
REV.17.14	Together they will go to war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will defeat them because he is Lord of all lords and King of all kings. And his called and chosen and faithful ones will be with him.”
REV.17.15	Then the angel said to me, “The waters where the prostitute is ruling represent masses of people of every nation and language. 
REV.17.16	The scarlet beast and his ten horns all hate the prostitute. They will strip her naked, eat her flesh, and burn her remains with fire. 
REV.17.17	For God has put a plan into their minds, a plan that will carry out his purposes. They will agree to give their authority to the scarlet beast, and so the words of God will be fulfilled. 
REV.17.18	And this woman you saw in your vision represents the great city that rules over the kings of the world.”
REV.18.1	After all this I saw another angel come down from heaven with great authority, and the earth grew bright with his splendor. 
REV.18.2	He gave a mighty shout:
REV.18.2	“Babylon is fallen—that great city is fallen!
REV.18.2	She has become a home for demons.
REV.18.2	She is a hideout for every foul
REV.18.2	a hideout for every foul vulture
REV.18.2	and every foul and dreadful animal.
REV.18.3	For all the nations have fallen
REV.18.3	because of the wine of her passionate immorality.
REV.18.3	The kings of the world
REV.18.3	have committed adultery with her.
REV.18.3	Because of her desires for extravagant luxury,
REV.18.3	the merchants of the world have grown rich.”
REV.18.4	Then I heard another voice calling from heaven,
REV.18.4	“Come away from her, my people.
REV.18.4	Do not take part in her sins,
REV.18.4	or you will be punished with her.
REV.18.5	For her sins are piled as high as heaven,
REV.18.5	and God remembers her evil deeds.
REV.18.6	Do to her as she has done to others.
REV.18.6	Double her penalty
REV.18.6	She brewed a cup of terror for others,
REV.18.6	so brew twice as much
REV.18.7	She glorified herself and lived in luxury,
REV.18.7	so match it now with torment and sorrow.
REV.18.7	She boasted in her heart,
REV.18.7	‘I am queen on my throne.
REV.18.7	I am no helpless widow,
REV.18.7	and I have no reason to mourn.’
REV.18.8	Therefore, these plagues will overtake her in a single day—
REV.18.8	death and mourning and famine.
REV.18.8	She will be completely consumed by fire,
REV.18.8	for the Lord God who judges her is mighty.”
REV.18.9	And the kings of the world who committed adultery with her and enjoyed her great luxury will mourn for her as they see the smoke rising from her charred remains. 
REV.18.10	They will stand at a distance, terrified by her great torment. They will cry out,
REV.18.10	“How terrible, how terrible for you,
REV.18.10	O Babylon, you great city!
REV.18.10	In a single moment
REV.18.10	God’s judgment came on you.”
REV.18.11	The merchants of the world will weep and mourn for her, for there is no one left to buy their goods. 
REV.18.12	She bought great quantities of gold, silver, jewels, and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet cloth; things made of fragrant thyine wood, ivory goods, and objects made of expensive wood; and bronze, iron, and marble. 
REV.18.13	She also bought cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, wagons, and bodies—that is, human slaves.
REV.18.14	“The fancy things you loved so much
REV.18.14	are gone,” they cry.
REV.18.14	“All your luxuries and splendor
REV.18.14	are gone forever,
REV.18.14	never to be yours again.”
REV.18.15	The merchants who became wealthy by selling her these things will stand at a distance, terrified by her great torment. They will weep and cry out,
REV.18.16	“How terrible, how terrible for that great city!
REV.18.16	She was clothed in finest purple and scarlet linens,
REV.18.16	decked out with gold and precious stones and pearls!
REV.18.17	In a single moment
REV.18.17	all the wealth of the city is gone!”
REV.18.17	And all the captains of the merchant ships and their passengers and sailors and crews will stand at a distance. 
REV.18.18	They will cry out as they watch the smoke ascend, and they will say, “Where is there another city as great as this?” 
REV.18.19	And they will weep and throw dust on their heads to show their grief. And they will cry out,
REV.18.19	“How terrible, how terrible for that great city!
REV.18.19	The shipowners became wealthy
REV.18.19	by transporting her great wealth on the seas.
REV.18.19	In a single moment it is all gone.”
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her fate, O heaven
REV.18.20	and people of God and apostles and prophets!
REV.18.20	For at last God has judged her
REV.18.20	for your sakes.
REV.18.21	Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a huge millstone. He threw it into the ocean and shouted,
REV.18.21	“Just like this, the great city Babylon
REV.18.21	will be thrown down with violence
REV.18.21	and will never be found again.
REV.18.22	The sound of harps, singers, flutes, and trumpets
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you again.
REV.18.22	No craftsmen and no trades
REV.18.22	will ever be found in you again.
REV.18.22	The sound of the mill
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you again.
REV.18.23	The light of a lamp
REV.18.23	will never shine in you again.
REV.18.23	The happy voices of brides and grooms
REV.18.23	will never be heard in you again.
REV.18.23	For your merchants were the greatest in the world,
REV.18.23	and you deceived the nations with your sorceries.
REV.18.24	In your
REV.18.24	and the blood of people slaughtered all over the world.”
REV.19.1	After this, I heard what sounded like a vast crowd in heaven shouting,
REV.19.1	“Praise the 
REV.19.1	Salvation and glory and power belong to our God.
REV.19.2	His judgments are true and just.
REV.19.2	He has punished the great prostitute
REV.19.2	who corrupted the earth with her immorality.
REV.19.2	He has avenged the murder of his servants.”
REV.19.3	And again their voices rang out:
REV.19.3	“Praise the 
REV.19.3	The smoke from that city ascends forever and ever!”
REV.19.4	Then the twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshiped God, who was sitting on the throne. They cried out, “Amen! Praise the 
REV.19.5	And from the throne came a voice that said,
REV.19.5	“Praise our God,
REV.19.5	all his servants,
REV.19.5	all who fear him,
REV.19.5	from the least to the greatest.”
REV.19.6	Then I heard again what sounded like the shout of a vast crowd or the roar of mighty ocean waves or the crash of loud thunder:
REV.19.6	“Praise the 
REV.19.6	For the Lord our God,
REV.19.7	Let us be glad and rejoice,
REV.19.7	and let us give honor to him.
REV.19.7	For the time has come for the wedding feast of the Lamb,
REV.19.7	and his bride has prepared herself.
REV.19.8	She has been given the finest of pure white linen to wear.”
REV.19.8	For the fine linen represents the good deeds of God’s holy people.
REV.19.9	And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb.” And he added, “These are true words that come from God.”
REV.19.10	Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said, “No, don’t worship me. I am a servant of God, just like you and your brothers and sisters
REV.19.11	Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. Its rider was named Faithful and True, for he judges fairly and wages a righteous war. 
REV.19.12	His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself. 
REV.19.13	He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title was the Word of God. 
REV.19.14	The armies of heaven, dressed in the finest of pure white linen, followed him on white horses. 
REV.19.15	From his mouth came a sharp sword to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He will release the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty, like juice flowing from a winepress. 
REV.19.16	On his robe at his thigh
REV.19.17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, shouting to the vultures flying high in the sky: “Come! Gather together for the great banquet God has prepared. 
REV.19.18	Come and eat the flesh of kings, generals, and strong warriors; of horses and their riders; and of all humanity, both free and slave, small and great.”
REV.19.19	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the world and their armies gathered together to fight against the one sitting on the horse and his army. 
REV.19.20	And the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who did mighty miracles on behalf of the beast—miracles that deceived all who had accepted the mark of the beast and who worshiped his statue. Both the beast and his false prophet were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. 
REV.19.21	Their entire army was killed by the sharp sword that came from the mouth of the one riding the white horse. And the vultures all gorged themselves on the dead bodies.
REV.20.1	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven with the key to the bottomless pit
REV.20.2	He seized the dragon—that old serpent, who is the devil, Satan—and bound him in chains for a thousand years. 
REV.20.3	The angel threw him into the bottomless pit, which he then shut and locked so Satan could not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were finished. Afterward he must be released for a little while.
REV.20.4	Then I saw thrones, and the people sitting on them had been given the authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony about Jesus and for proclaiming the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his statue, nor accepted his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They all came to life again, and they reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
REV.20.5	This is the first resurrection. (The rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years had ended.) 
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. For them the second death holds no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him a thousand years.
REV.20.7	When the thousand years come to an end, Satan will be let out of his prison. 
REV.20.8	He will go out to deceive the nations—called Gog and Magog—in every corner of the earth. He will gather them together for battle—a mighty army, as numberless as sand along the seashore. 
REV.20.9	And I saw them as they went up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded God’s people and the beloved city. But fire from heaven came down on the attacking armies and consumed them.
REV.20.10	Then the devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the fiery lake of burning sulfur, joining the beast and the false prophet. There they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
REV.20.11	And I saw a great white throne and the one sitting on it. The earth and sky fled from his presence, but they found no place to hide. 
REV.20.12	I saw the dead, both great and small, standing before God’s throne. And the books were opened, including the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to what they had done, as recorded in the books. 
REV.20.13	The sea gave up its dead, and death and the grave
REV.20.14	Then death and the grave were thrown into the lake of fire. This lake of fire is the second death. 
REV.20.15	And anyone whose name was not found recorded in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire.
REV.21.1	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the old heaven and the old earth had disappeared. And the sea was also gone. 
REV.21.2	And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
REV.21.3	I heard a loud shout from the throne, saying, “Look, God’s home is now among his people! He will live with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them.
REV.21.4	He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain. All these things are gone forever.”
REV.21.5	And the one sitting on the throne said, “Look, I am making everything new!” And then he said to me, “Write this down, for what I tell you is trustworthy and true.” 
REV.21.6	And he also said, “It is finished! I am the Alpha and the Omega—the Beginning and the End. To all who are thirsty I will give freely from the springs of the water of life. 
REV.21.7	All who are victorious will inherit all these blessings, and I will be their God, and they will be my children.
REV.21.8	“But cowards, unbelievers, the corrupt, murderers, the immoral, those who practice witchcraft, idol worshipers, and all liars—their fate is in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”
REV.21.9	Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls containing the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come with me! I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”
REV.21.10	So he took me in the Spirit
REV.21.11	It shone with the glory of God and sparkled like a precious stone—like jasper as clear as crystal. 
REV.21.12	The city wall was broad and high, with twelve gates guarded by twelve angels. And the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written on the gates. 
REV.21.13	There were three gates on each side—east, north, south, and west. 
REV.21.14	The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
REV.21.15	The angel who talked to me held in his hand a gold measuring stick to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 
REV.21.16	When he measured it, he found it was a square, as wide as it was long. In fact, its length and width and height were each 1,400 miles.
REV.21.17	Then he measured the walls and found them to be 216 feet thick
REV.21.18	The wall was made of jasper, and the city was pure gold, as clear as glass. 
REV.21.19	The wall of the city was built on foundation stones inlaid with twelve precious stones:
REV.21.20	the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
REV.21.21	The twelve gates were made of pearls—each gate from a single pearl! And the main street was pure gold, as clear as glass.
REV.21.22	I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 
REV.21.23	And the city has no need of sun or moon, for the glory of God illuminates the city, and the Lamb is its light. 
REV.21.24	The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the world will enter the city in all their glory. 
REV.21.25	Its gates will never be closed at the end of day because there is no night there. 
REV.21.26	And all the nations will bring their glory and honor into the city. 
REV.21.27	Nothing evil
REV.22.1	Then the angel showed me a river with the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb. 
REV.22.2	It flowed down the center of the main street. On each side of the river grew a tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit,
REV.22.3	No longer will there be a curse upon anything. For the throne of God and of the Lamb will be there, and his servants will worship him. 
REV.22.4	And they will see his face, and his name will be written on their foreheads. 
REV.22.5	And there will be no night there—no need for lamps or sun—for the Lord God will shine on them. And they will reign forever and ever.
REV.22.6	Then the angel said to me, “Everything you have heard and seen is trustworthy and true. The Lord God, who inspires his prophets,
REV.22.8	I, John, am the one who heard and saw all these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me. 
REV.22.9	But he said, “No, don’t worship me. I am a servant of God, just like you and your brothers the prophets, as well as all who obey what is written in this book. Worship only God!”
REV.22.10	Then he instructed me, “Do not seal up the prophetic words in this book, for the time is near. 
REV.22.11	Let the one who is doing harm continue to do harm; let the one who is vile continue to be vile; let the one who is righteous continue to live righteously; let the one who is holy continue to be holy.”
REV.22.14	Blessed are those who wash their robes. They will be permitted to enter through the gates of the city and eat the fruit from the tree of life. 
REV.22.15	Outside the city are the dogs—the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idol worshipers, and all who love to live a lie.
REV.22.17	The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.” Let anyone who hears this say, “Come.” Let anyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone who desires drink freely from the water of life. 
REV.22.18	And I solemnly declare to everyone who hears the words of prophecy written in this book: If anyone adds anything to what is written here, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book. 
REV.22.19	And if anyone removes any of the words from this book of prophecy, God will remove that person’s share in the tree of life and in the holy city that are described in this book.
REV.22.20	He who is the faithful witness to all these things says, 
REV.22.20	Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!
REV.22.21	May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s holy people.
