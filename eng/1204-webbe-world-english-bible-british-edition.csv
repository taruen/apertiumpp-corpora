GEN.1.1	In the beginning, God
GEN.1.2	The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
GEN.1.3	God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
GEN.1.4	God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first day.
GEN.1.6	God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” 
GEN.1.7	God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. 
GEN.1.8	God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
GEN.1.9	God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so. 
GEN.1.10	God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.11	God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;” and it was so. 
GEN.1.12	The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.13	There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
GEN.1.14	God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years; 
GEN.1.15	and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth;” and it was so. 
GEN.1.16	God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars. 
GEN.1.17	God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth, 
GEN.1.18	and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.19	There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
GEN.1.20	God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.” 
GEN.1.21	God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.22	God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” 
GEN.1.23	There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
GEN.1.24	God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;” and it was so. 
GEN.1.25	God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.26	God said, “Let’s make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” 
GEN.1.27	God created man in his own image. In God’s image he created him; male and female he created them. 
GEN.1.28	God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” 
GEN.1.29	God said, “Behold,
GEN.1.30	To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so.
GEN.1.31	God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.
GEN.2.1	The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished. 
GEN.2.2	On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. 
GEN.2.3	God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had done.
GEN.2.4	This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the 
GEN.2.5	No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the 
GEN.2.6	but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground. 
GEN.2.7	The 
GEN.2.8	The 
GEN.2.9	Out of the ground the 
GEN.2.10	A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers. 
GEN.2.11	The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 
GEN.2.12	and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium
GEN.2.13	The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush. 
GEN.2.14	The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. 
GEN.2.15	The 
GEN.2.16	The 
GEN.2.17	but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”
GEN.2.18	The 
GEN.2.19	Out of the ground the 
GEN.2.20	The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to him. 
GEN.2.21	The 
GEN.2.22	The 
GEN.2.23	The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken out of Man.” 
GEN.2.24	Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh. 
GEN.2.25	The man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed.
GEN.3.1	Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which the 
GEN.3.2	The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden, 
GEN.3.3	but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’”
GEN.3.4	The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die, 
GEN.3.5	for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
GEN.3.6	When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too. 
GEN.3.7	Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves. 
GEN.3.8	They heard the 
GEN.3.9	The 
GEN.3.10	The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.”
GEN.3.11	God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
GEN.3.12	The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
GEN.3.13	The 
GEN.3.13	The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
GEN.3.14	The 
GEN.3.14	“Because you have done this,
GEN.3.14	you are cursed above all livestock,
GEN.3.14	and above every animal of the field.
GEN.3.14	You shall go on your belly
GEN.3.14	and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.
GEN.3.15	I will put hostility between you and the woman,
GEN.3.15	and between your offspring and her offspring.
GEN.3.15	He will bruise your head,
GEN.3.15	and you will bruise his heel.”
GEN.3.16	To the woman he said,
GEN.3.16	“I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.
GEN.3.16	You will bear children in pain.
GEN.3.16	Your desire will be for your husband,
GEN.3.16	and he will rule over you.”
GEN.3.17	To Adam he said,
GEN.3.17	“Because you have listened to your wife’s voice,
GEN.3.17	and have eaten from the tree,
GEN.3.17	about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’
GEN.3.17	the ground is cursed for your sake.
GEN.3.17	You will eat from it with much labour all the days of your life.
GEN.3.18	It will yield thorns and thistles to you;
GEN.3.18	and you will eat the herb of the field.
GEN.3.19	You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground,
GEN.3.19	for you were taken out of it.
GEN.3.19	For you are dust,
GEN.3.19	and you shall return to dust.”
GEN.3.20	The man called his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all the living. 
GEN.3.21	The 
GEN.3.22	The 
GEN.3.23	Therefore the 
GEN.3.24	So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim
GEN.4.1	The man knew
GEN.4.2	Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 
GEN.4.3	As time passed, Cain brought an offering to the 
GEN.4.4	Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. The 
GEN.4.5	but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell. 
GEN.4.6	The 
GEN.4.7	If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.” 
GEN.4.8	Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
GEN.4.9	The 
GEN.4.9	He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”
GEN.4.10	The 
GEN.4.11	Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 
GEN.4.12	From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.”
GEN.4.13	Cain said to the 
GEN.4.14	Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.”
GEN.4.15	The 
GEN.4.16	Cain left the 
GEN.4.17	Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch. 
GEN.4.18	Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech. 
GEN.4.19	Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. 
GEN.4.21	His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe. 
GEN.4.22	Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah. 
GEN.4.23	Lamech said to his wives,
GEN.4.23	“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.
GEN.4.23	You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,
GEN.4.23	for I have slain a man for wounding me,
GEN.4.23	a young man for bruising me.
GEN.4.24	If Cain will be avenged seven times,
GEN.4.24	truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”
GEN.4.25	Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.” 
GEN.4.26	A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the 
GEN.5.1	This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in God’s likeness. 
GEN.5.2	He created them male and female, and blessed them. On the day they were created, he named them Adam.
GEN.5.3	Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth. 
GEN.5.4	The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.5	All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, then he died.
GEN.5.6	Seth lived one hundred and five years, then became the father of Enosh. 
GEN.5.7	Seth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.8	All of the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, then he died.
GEN.5.9	Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan. 
GEN.5.10	Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.11	All of the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, then he died.
GEN.5.12	Kenan lived seventy years, then became the father of Mahalalel. 
GEN.5.13	Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters 
GEN.5.14	and all of the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, then he died.
GEN.5.15	Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Jared. 
GEN.5.16	Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.17	All of the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, then he died.
GEN.5.18	Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, then became the father of Enoch. 
GEN.5.19	Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.20	All of the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, then he died.
GEN.5.21	Enoch lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	After Methuselah’s birth, Enoch walked with God for three hundred years, and became the father of more sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.23	All the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. 
GEN.5.24	Enoch walked with God, and he was not found, for God took him.
GEN.5.25	Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, then became the father of Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred and eighty-two years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.27	All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, then he died.
GEN.5.28	Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, then became the father of a son. 
GEN.5.29	He named him Noah, saying, “This one will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, caused by the ground which the 
GEN.5.30	Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred and ninety-five years, and became the father of other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.31	All the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, then he died.
GEN.5.32	Noah was five hundred years old, then Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	When men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them, 
GEN.6.2	God’s sons saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives. 
GEN.6.3	The 
GEN.6.4	The Nephilim
GEN.6.5	The 
GEN.6.6	The 
GEN.6.7	The 
GEN.6.8	But Noah found favour in the 
GEN.6.9	This is the history of the generations of Noah: Noah was a righteous man, blameless amongst the people of his time. Noah walked with God. 
GEN.6.10	Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
GEN.6.11	The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
GEN.6.12	God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
GEN.6.13	God said to Noah, “I will bring an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them and the earth. 
GEN.6.14	Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch. 
GEN.6.15	This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship shall be three hundred cubits,
GEN.6.16	You shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels. 
GEN.6.17	I, even I, will bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die. 
GEN.6.18	But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. 
GEN.6.19	Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. 
GEN.6.20	Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort will come to you, to keep them alive. 
GEN.6.21	Take with you some of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you, and for them.” 
GEN.6.22	Thus Noah did. He did all that God commanded him.
GEN.7.1	The 
GEN.7.2	You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female. 
GEN.7.3	Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth. 
GEN.7.4	In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will destroy every living thing that I have made from the surface of the ground.”
GEN.7.5	Noah did everything that the 
GEN.7.6	Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth. 
GEN.7.7	Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, because of the floodwaters. 
GEN.7.8	Clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground 
GEN.7.9	went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	After the seven days, the floodwaters came on the earth. 
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the sky’s windows opened. 
GEN.7.12	It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights.
GEN.7.13	In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth—the sons of Noah—and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship— 
GEN.7.14	they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort. 
GEN.7.15	Pairs from all flesh with the breath of life in them went into the ship to Noah. 
GEN.7.16	Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; then the 
GEN.7.17	The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth. 
GEN.7.18	The waters rose, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters. 
GEN.7.19	The waters rose very high on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered. 
GEN.7.20	The waters rose fifteen cubits
GEN.7.21	All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man. 
GEN.7.22	All on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died. 
GEN.7.23	Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship. 
GEN.7.24	The waters flooded the earth one hundred and fifty days.
GEN.8.1	God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided. 
GEN.8.2	The deep’s fountains and the sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained. 
GEN.8.3	The waters continually receded from the earth. After the end of one hundred and fifty days the waters receded. 
GEN.8.4	The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat’s mountains. 
GEN.8.5	The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible.
GEN.8.6	At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made, 
GEN.8.7	and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth. 
GEN.8.8	He himself sent out a dove to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground, 
GEN.8.9	but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned into the ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship. 
GEN.8.10	He waited yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the ship. 
GEN.8.11	The dove came back to him at evening and, behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth. 
GEN.8.12	He waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn’t return to him any more.
GEN.8.13	In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dry. 
GEN.8.14	In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
GEN.8.15	God spoke to Noah, saying, 
GEN.8.16	“Go out of the ship, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you. 
GEN.8.17	Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.”
GEN.8.18	Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him. 
GEN.8.19	Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
GEN.8.20	Noah built an altar to the 
GEN.8.21	The 
GEN.8.22	While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.”
GEN.9.1	God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth. 
GEN.9.2	The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that moves along the ground, and all the fish of the sea, are delivered into your hand. 
GEN.9.3	Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I gave you the green herb, I have given everything to you. 
GEN.9.4	But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat. 
GEN.9.5	I will surely require accounting for your life’s blood. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man. 
GEN.9.6	Whoever sheds man’s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image. 
GEN.9.7	Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.”
GEN.9.8	God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 
GEN.9.9	“As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you, 
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth. 
GEN.9.11	I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood. There will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.” 
GEN.9.12	God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 
GEN.9.13	I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between me and the earth. 
GEN.9.14	When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud, 
GEN.9.15	I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
GEN.9.16	The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” 
GEN.9.17	God said to Noah, “This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”
GEN.9.18	The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan. 
GEN.9.19	These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated.
GEN.9.20	Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard. 
GEN.9.21	He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent. 
GEN.9.22	Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. 
GEN.9.23	Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness. 
GEN.9.24	Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him. 
GEN.9.25	He said,
GEN.9.25	“Canaan is cursed.
GEN.9.25	He will be a servant of servants to his brothers.”
GEN.9.26	He said,
GEN.9.26	“Blessed be the 
GEN.9.26	Let Canaan be his servant.
GEN.9.27	May God enlarge Japheth.
GEN.9.27	Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.
GEN.9.27	Let Canaan be his servant.”
GEN.9.28	Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood. 
GEN.9.29	All the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and then he died.
GEN.10.1	Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 
GEN.10.3	The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
GEN.10.4	The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
GEN.10.5	Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations.
GEN.10.6	The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 
GEN.10.7	The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan. 
GEN.10.8	Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
GEN.10.9	He was a mighty hunter before the 
GEN.10.10	The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
GEN.10.11	Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, 
GEN.10.12	and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah. 
GEN.10.13	Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 
GEN.10.14	Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.
GEN.10.15	Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth, 
GEN.10.16	the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 
GEN.10.17	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 
GEN.10.18	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad. 
GEN.10.19	The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go towards Gerar—to Gaza—as you go towards Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha. 
GEN.10.20	These are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.
GEN.10.21	Children were also born to Shem (the elder brother of Japheth), the father of all the children of Eber. 
GEN.10.22	The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. 
GEN.10.23	The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 
GEN.10.24	Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber. 
GEN.10.25	To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan. 
GEN.10.26	Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 
GEN.10.30	Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go towards Sephar, the mountain of the east. 
GEN.10.31	These are the sons of Shem, by their families, according to their languages, lands, and nations.
GEN.10.32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood.
GEN.11.1	The whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 
GEN.11.2	As they travelled east,
GEN.11.3	They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. 
GEN.11.4	They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.”
GEN.11.5	The 
GEN.11.6	The 
GEN.11.7	Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.” 
GEN.11.8	So the 
GEN.11.9	Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the 
GEN.11.10	This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood. 
GEN.11.11	Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN.11.12	Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah. 
GEN.11.13	Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN.11.14	Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber. 
GEN.11.15	Shelah lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN.11.16	Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg. 
GEN.11.17	Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN.11.18	Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu. 
GEN.11.19	Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug. 
GEN.11.21	Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor. 
GEN.11.23	Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN.11.24	Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah. 
GEN.11.25	Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot. 
GEN.11.28	Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees, while his father Terah was still alive. 
GEN.11.29	Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was also the father of Iscah. 
GEN.11.30	Sarai was barren. She had no child. 
GEN.11.31	Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there. 
GEN.11.32	The days of Terah were two hundred and five years. Terah died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	Now the 
GEN.12.2	I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing. 
GEN.12.3	I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who treats you with contempt. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.”
GEN.12.4	So Abram went, as the 
GEN.12.5	Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother’s son, all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan. They entered into the land of Canaan. 
GEN.12.6	Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time, Canaanites were in the land.
GEN.12.7	The 
GEN.12.7	He built an altar there to the 
GEN.12.8	He left from there to go to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the 
GEN.12.9	Abram travelled, still going on towards the South.
GEN.12.10	There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land. 
GEN.12.11	When he had come near to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at. 
GEN.12.12	It will happen that when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me, but they will save you alive. 
GEN.12.13	Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.”
GEN.12.14	When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. 
GEN.12.15	The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. 
GEN.12.16	He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels. 
GEN.12.17	The 
GEN.12.18	Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.”
GEN.12.20	Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they escorted him away with his wife and all that he had.
GEN.13.1	Abram went up out of Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into the South. 
GEN.13.2	Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. 
GEN.13.3	He went on his journeys from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 
GEN.13.4	to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on the 
GEN.13.5	Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents. 
GEN.13.6	The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their possessions were so great that they couldn’t live together. 
GEN.13.7	There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time. 
GEN.13.8	Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives. 
GEN.13.9	Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”
GEN.13.10	Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before the 
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot travelled east, and they separated themselves from one other. 
GEN.13.12	Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom. 
GEN.13.13	Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against the 
GEN.13.14	The 
GEN.13.15	for I will give all the land which you see to you and to your offspring forever. 
GEN.13.16	I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be counted. 
GEN.13.17	Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.”
GEN.13.18	Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to the 
GEN.14.1	In the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar; Arioch, king of Ellasar; Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; and Tidal, king of Goiim, 
GEN.14.2	they made war with Bera, king of Sodom; Birsha, king of Gomorrah; Shinab, king of Admah; Shemeber, king of Zeboiim; and the king of Bela (also called Zoar). 
GEN.14.3	All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea). 
GEN.14.4	They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
GEN.14.5	In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to El Paran, which is by the wilderness. 
GEN.14.7	They returned, and came to En Mishpat (also called Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar. 
GEN.14.8	The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim 
GEN.14.9	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. 
GEN.14.10	Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and some fell there. Those who remained fled to the hills. 
GEN.14.11	They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way. 
GEN.14.12	They took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
GEN.14.13	One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. At that time, he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner. They were allies of Abram. 
GEN.14.14	When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led out his three hundred and eighteen trained men, born in his house, and pursued as far as Dan. 
GEN.14.15	He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot and his goods, and the women also, and the other people.
GEN.14.17	The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 
GEN.14.18	Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High. 
GEN.14.19	He blessed him, and said, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth. 
GEN.14.20	Blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”
GEN.14.20	Abram gave him a tenth of all.
GEN.14.21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself.”
GEN.14.22	Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to the 
GEN.14.23	that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ 
GEN.14.24	I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.”
GEN.15.1	After these things the 
GEN.15.2	Abram said, “Lord
GEN.15.3	Abram said, “Behold, you have given no children to me: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.”
GEN.15.4	Behold, the 
GEN.15.5	The 
GEN.15.6	He believed in the 
GEN.15.7	He said to Abram, “I am the 
GEN.15.8	He said, “Lord GOD, how will I know that I will inherit it?”
GEN.15.9	He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” 
GEN.15.10	He brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds. 
GEN.15.11	The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him. 
GEN.15.13	He said to Abram, “Know for sure that your offspring will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years. 
GEN.15.14	I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth; 
GEN.15.15	but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age. 
GEN.15.16	In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.” 
GEN.15.17	It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. 
GEN.15.18	In that day the 
GEN.15.19	the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 
GEN.15.21	the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children. She had a servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. 
GEN.16.2	Sarai said to Abram, “See now, the 
GEN.16.3	Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. 
GEN.16.4	He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. 
GEN.16.5	Sarai said to Abram, “This wrong is your fault. I gave my servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, she despised me. May The 
GEN.16.6	But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good in your eyes.” Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.
GEN.16.7	The 
GEN.16.8	He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s servant, where did you come from? Where are you going?”
GEN.16.8	She said, “I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.”
GEN.16.9	The 
GEN.16.10	The 
GEN.16.11	The 
GEN.16.12	He will be like a wild donkey amongst men. His hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him. He will live opposed to all of his brothers.”
GEN.16.13	She called the name of the 
GEN.16.14	Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi.
GEN.16.15	Hagar bore a son for Abram. Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
GEN.17.1	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the 
GEN.17.2	I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.”
GEN.17.3	Abram fell on his face. God talked with him, saying, 
GEN.17.4	“As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations. 
GEN.17.5	Your name will no more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. 
GEN.17.6	I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you. 
GEN.17.7	I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your offspring after you. 
GEN.17.8	I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are travelling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God.”
GEN.17.9	God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations. 
GEN.17.10	This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you. Every male amongst you shall be circumcised. 
GEN.17.11	You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you. 
GEN.17.12	He who is eight days old shall be circumcised amongst you, every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring. 
GEN.17.13	He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
GEN.17.14	The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant.”
GEN.17.15	God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name shall be Sarah. 
GEN.17.16	I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her.”
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?” 
GEN.17.18	Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!”
GEN.17.19	God said, “No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call his name Isaac.
GEN.17.20	As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.”
GEN.17.22	When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham. 
GEN.17.23	Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money: every male amongst the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him. 
GEN.17.24	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.25	Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
GEN.17.26	In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised. 
GEN.17.27	All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	The 
GEN.18.2	He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood near him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, 
GEN.18.3	and said, “My lord, if now I have found favour in your sight, please don’t go away from your servant. 
GEN.18.4	Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. 
GEN.18.5	I will get a piece of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.”
GEN.18.5	They said, “Very well, do as you have said.”
GEN.18.6	Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly prepare three seahs
GEN.18.7	Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it. 
GEN.18.8	He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
GEN.18.9	They asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?”
GEN.18.9	He said, “There, in the tent.”
GEN.18.10	He said, “I will certainly return to you at about this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.”
GEN.18.10	Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him. 
GEN.18.11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. 
GEN.18.12	Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?”
GEN.18.13	The 
GEN.18.14	Is anything too hard for the 
GEN.18.15	Then Sarah denied it, saying, “I didn’t laugh,” for she was afraid.
GEN.18.15	He said, “No, but you did laugh.”
GEN.18.16	The men rose up from there, and looked towards Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way. 
GEN.18.17	The 
GEN.18.18	since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him? 
GEN.18.19	For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the 
GEN.18.20	The 
GEN.18.21	I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know.”
GEN.18.22	The men turned from there, and went towards Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before the 
GEN.18.23	Abraham came near, and said, “Will you consume the righteous with the wicked? 
GEN.18.24	What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it? 
GEN.18.25	May it be far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn’t the Judge of all the earth do right?”
GEN.18.26	The 
GEN.18.27	Abraham answered, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, although I am dust and ashes. 
GEN.18.28	What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?”
GEN.18.28	He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”
GEN.18.29	He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?”
GEN.18.29	He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.”
GEN.18.30	He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?”
GEN.18.30	He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”
GEN.18.31	He said, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there?”
GEN.18.31	He said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.”
GEN.18.32	He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?”
GEN.18.32	He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.”
GEN.18.33	The 
GEN.19.1	The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth, 
GEN.19.2	and he said, “See now, my lords, please come into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.”
GEN.19.2	They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”
GEN.19.3	He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 
GEN.19.4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter. 
GEN.19.5	They called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.”
GEN.19.6	Lot went out to them through the door, and shut the door after himself. 
GEN.19.7	He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly. 
GEN.19.8	See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.”
GEN.19.9	They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now we will deal worse with you than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break the door. 
GEN.19.10	But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door. 
GEN.19.11	They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
GEN.19.12	The men said to Lot, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place: 
GEN.19.13	for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before the 
GEN.19.14	Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for the 
GEN.19.14	But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking. 
GEN.19.15	When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.” 
GEN.19.16	But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, the 
GEN.19.17	It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!”
GEN.19.18	Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord. 
GEN.19.19	See now, your servant has found favour in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die. 
GEN.19.20	See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.”
GEN.19.21	He said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. 
GEN.19.22	Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
GEN.19.23	The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. 
GEN.19.24	Then the 
GEN.19.25	He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground. 
GEN.19.26	But Lot’s wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
GEN.19.27	Abraham went up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the 
GEN.19.28	He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
GEN.19.29	When God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
GEN.19.30	Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters. 
GEN.19.31	The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth. 
GEN.19.32	Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.” 
GEN.19.33	They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
GEN.19.34	It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let’s make him drink wine again tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.” 
GEN.19.35	They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up. 
GEN.19.36	Thus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father. 
GEN.19.37	The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. 
GEN.19.38	The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.
GEN.20.1	Abraham travelled from there towards the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar. 
GEN.20.2	Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man’s wife.”
GEN.20.4	Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation? 
GEN.20.5	Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister’? She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”
GEN.20.6	God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her. 
GEN.20.7	Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.”
GEN.20.8	Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!” 
GEN.20.10	Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”
GEN.20.11	Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’ 
GEN.20.12	Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
GEN.20.13	When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”
GEN.20.14	Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him. 
GEN.20.15	Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.” 
GEN.20.16	To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.”
GEN.20.17	Abraham prayed to God. So God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children. 
GEN.20.18	For the 
GEN.21.1	The 
GEN.21.2	Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
GEN.21.3	Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
GEN.21.4	Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 
GEN.21.5	Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him. 
GEN.21.6	Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.” 
GEN.21.7	She said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.”
GEN.21.8	The child grew and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 
GEN.21.9	Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. 
GEN.21.10	Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this servant and her son! For the son of this servant will not be heir with my son, Isaac.”
GEN.21.11	The thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son. 
GEN.21.12	God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your servant. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring will be named through Isaac. 
GEN.21.13	I will also make a nation of the son of the servant, because he is your child.” 
GEN.21.14	Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a container of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
GEN.21.15	The water in the container was spent, and she put the child under one of the shrubs. 
GEN.21.16	She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.” She sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. 
GEN.21.17	God heard the voice of the boy.
GEN.21.17	The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. 
GEN.21.18	Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him with your hand. For I will make him a great nation.”
GEN.21.19	God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the container with water, and gave the boy a drink.
GEN.21.20	God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and as he grew up, he became an archer. 
GEN.21.21	He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother got a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.22	At that time, Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do. 
GEN.21.23	Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.”
GEN.21.24	Abraham said, “I will swear.” 
GEN.21.25	Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away. 
GEN.21.26	Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t hear of it until today.”
GEN.21.27	Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant. 
GEN.21.28	Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
GEN.21.29	Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs, which you have set by themselves, mean?”
GEN.21.30	He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.” 
GEN.21.31	Therefore he called that place Beersheba,
GEN.21.32	So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 
GEN.21.33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the 
GEN.21.34	Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.
GEN.22.1	After these things, God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!”
GEN.22.1	He said, “Here I am.”
GEN.22.2	He said, “Now take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.”
GEN.22.3	Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey; and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off. 
GEN.22.5	Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there. We will worship, and come back to you.” 
GEN.22.6	Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together. 
GEN.22.7	Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?”
GEN.22.7	He said, “Here I am, my son.”
GEN.22.7	He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
GEN.22.8	Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they both went together. 
GEN.22.9	They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood. 
GEN.22.10	Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.
GEN.22.11	The 
GEN.22.11	He said, “Here I am.”
GEN.22.12	He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”
GEN.22.13	Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son. 
GEN.22.14	Abraham called the name of that place “The 
GEN.22.15	The 
GEN.22.16	and said, “‘I have sworn by myself,’ says the 
GEN.22.17	that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your offspring greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the gate of his enemies. 
GEN.22.18	All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring, because you have obeyed my voice.’”
GEN.22.19	So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.
GEN.22.20	After these things, Abraham was told, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor: 
GEN.22.21	Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
GEN.22.22	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. 
GEN.22.24	His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah’s life. 
GEN.23.2	Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 
GEN.23.3	Abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke to the children of Heth, saying, 
GEN.23.4	“I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”
GEN.23.5	The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, 
GEN.23.6	“Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God amongst us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.”
GEN.23.7	Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth. 
GEN.23.8	He talked with them, saying, “If you agree that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 
GEN.23.9	that he may sell me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him sell it to me amongst you as a possession for a burial place.”
GEN.23.10	Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying, 
GEN.23.11	“No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.”
GEN.23.12	Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land. 
GEN.23.13	He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.”
GEN.23.14	Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 
GEN.23.15	“My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver
GEN.23.16	Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard.
GEN.23.17	So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded 
GEN.23.18	to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city. 
GEN.23.19	After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.20	The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham by the children of Heth as a possession for a burial place.
GEN.24.1	Abraham was old, and well advanced in age. The 
GEN.24.2	Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh. 
GEN.24.3	I will make you swear by the 
GEN.24.4	But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”
GEN.24.5	The servant said to him, “What if the woman isn’t willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?”
GEN.24.6	Abraham said to him, “Beware that you don’t bring my son there again. 
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	If the woman isn’t willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath to me. Only you shall not bring my son there again.”
GEN.24.9	The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter. 
GEN.24.10	The servant took ten of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. 
GEN.24.11	He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. 
GEN.24.12	He said, “The 
GEN.24.13	Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. 
GEN.24.14	Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,’ then she says, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,’—let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”
GEN.24.15	Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder. 
GEN.24.16	The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up. 
GEN.24.17	The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.”
GEN.24.18	She said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have finished drinking.” 
GEN.24.20	She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
GEN.24.21	The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether the 
GEN.24.22	As the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a shekel
GEN.24.23	and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay?”
GEN.24.24	She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” 
GEN.24.25	She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in.”
GEN.24.26	The man bowed his head, and worshipped the 
GEN.24.27	He said, “Blessed be the 
GEN.24.28	The young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words. 
GEN.24.29	Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring. 
GEN.24.30	When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. 
GEN.24.31	He said, “Come in, you blessed of the 
GEN.24.32	The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 
GEN.24.33	Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.”
GEN.24.33	Laban said, “Speak on.”
GEN.24.34	He said, “I am Abraham’s servant. 
GEN.24.35	The 
GEN.24.36	Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him. 
GEN.24.37	My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, 
GEN.24.38	but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’ 
GEN.24.39	I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’ 
GEN.24.40	He said to me, ‘The 
GEN.24.41	Then you will be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’ 
GEN.24.42	I came today to the spring, and said, ‘The 
GEN.24.43	behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,” 
GEN.24.44	then she tells me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let her be the woman whom the 
GEN.24.45	Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ 
GEN.24.46	She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink. 
GEN.24.47	I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands. 
GEN.24.48	I bowed my head, and worshipped the 
GEN.24.49	Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.”
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from the 
GEN.24.51	Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as the 
GEN.24.52	When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to the 
GEN.24.53	The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother. 
GEN.24.54	They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”
GEN.24.55	Her brother and her mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go.”
GEN.24.56	He said to them, “Don’t hinder me, since the 
GEN.24.57	They said, “We will call the young lady, and ask her.” 
GEN.24.58	They called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?”
GEN.24.58	She said, “I will go.”
GEN.24.59	They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham’s servant, and his men. 
GEN.24.60	They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them.”
GEN.24.61	Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way. 
GEN.24.62	Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South. 
GEN.24.63	Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes and looked. Behold, there were camels coming. 
GEN.24.64	Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she got off the camel. 
GEN.24.65	She said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?”
GEN.24.65	The servant said, “It is my master.”
GEN.24.65	She took her veil, and covered herself. 
GEN.24.66	The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. 
GEN.24.67	Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
GEN.25.1	Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 
GEN.25.4	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 
GEN.25.5	Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac, 
GEN.25.6	but Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Abraham’s concubines. While he still lived, he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country. 
GEN.25.7	These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years. 
GEN.25.8	Abraham gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people. 
GEN.25.9	Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is near Mamre, 
GEN.25.10	the field which Abraham purchased from the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife. 
GEN.25.11	After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.
GEN.25.12	Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham. 
GEN.25.13	These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations. 
GEN.25.17	These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people. 
GEN.25.18	They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go towards Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.
GEN.25.19	This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac. 
GEN.25.20	Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife. 
GEN.25.21	Isaac entreated the 
GEN.25.22	The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is like this, why do I live?” She went to enquire of the 
GEN.25.23	The 
GEN.25.23	“Two nations are in your womb.
GEN.25.23	Two peoples will be separated from your body.
GEN.25.23	The one people will be stronger than the other people.
GEN.25.23	The elder will serve the younger.”
GEN.25.24	When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.25.25	The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau. 
GEN.25.26	After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
GEN.25.27	The boys grew. Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. 
GEN.25.28	Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob. 
GEN.25.29	Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished. 
GEN.25.30	Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom.
GEN.25.31	Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”
GEN.25.32	Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”
GEN.25.33	Jacob said, “Swear to me first.”
GEN.25.33	He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob. 
GEN.25.34	Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.
GEN.26.1	There was a famine in the land, in addition to the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar. 
GEN.26.2	The 
GEN.26.3	Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. 
GEN.26.4	I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring. In your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed, 
GEN.26.5	because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”
GEN.26.6	Isaac lived in Gerar. 
GEN.26.7	The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.” 
GEN.26.8	When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife. 
GEN.26.9	Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’”
GEN.26.9	Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”
GEN.26.10	Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”
GEN.26.11	Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”
GEN.26.12	Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. The 
GEN.26.13	The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great. 
GEN.26.14	He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him. 
GEN.26.15	Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. 
GEN.26.16	Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”
GEN.26.17	Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.
GEN.26.18	Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 
GEN.26.19	Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of flowing
GEN.26.20	The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek,
GEN.26.21	They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. So he called its name Sitnah.
GEN.26.22	He left that place, and dug another well. They didn’t argue over that one. So he called it Rehoboth.
GEN.26.23	He went up from there to Beersheba. 
GEN.26.24	The 
GEN.26.25	He built an altar there, and called on the 
GEN.26.26	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army. 
GEN.26.27	Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?”
GEN.26.28	They said, “We saw plainly that the 
GEN.26.29	that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of the 
GEN.26.30	He made them a feast, and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	They rose up some time in the morning, and swore an oath to one another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
GEN.26.32	The same day, Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” 
GEN.26.33	He called it “Shibah”.
GEN.26.34	When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
GEN.26.35	They grieved Isaac’s and Rebekah’s spirits.
GEN.27.1	When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, “My son?”
GEN.27.1	He said to him, “Here I am.”
GEN.27.2	He said, “See now, I am old. I don’t know the day of my death. 
GEN.27.3	Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and get me venison. 
GEN.27.4	Make me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.”
GEN.27.5	Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 
GEN.27.6	Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring me venison, and make me savoury food, that I may eat, and bless you before the 
GEN.27.8	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you. 
GEN.27.9	Go now to the flock and get me two good young goats from there. I will make them savoury food for your father, such as he loves. 
GEN.27.10	You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”
GEN.27.11	Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. 
GEN.27.12	What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.”
GEN.27.13	His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.”
GEN.27.14	He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savoury food, such as his father loved. 
GEN.27.15	Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son. 
GEN.27.16	She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck. 
GEN.27.17	She gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
GEN.27.18	He came to his father, and said, “My father?”
GEN.27.18	He said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”
GEN.27.19	Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.”
GEN.27.20	Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?”
GEN.27.20	He said, “Because the 
GEN.27.21	Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.”
GEN.27.22	Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 
GEN.27.23	He didn’t recognise him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau’s hands. So he blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	He said, “Are you really my son Esau?”
GEN.27.24	He said, “I am.”
GEN.27.25	He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you.”
GEN.27.25	He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank. 
GEN.27.26	His father Isaac said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.” 
GEN.27.27	He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said,
GEN.27.27	“Behold, the smell of my son
GEN.27.27	is as the smell of a field which the 
GEN.27.28	God give you of the dew of the sky,
GEN.27.28	of the fatness of the earth,
GEN.27.28	and plenty of grain and new wine.
GEN.27.29	Let peoples serve you,
GEN.27.29	and nations bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	Be lord over your brothers.
GEN.27.29	Let your mother’s sons bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	Cursed be everyone who curses you.
GEN.27.29	Blessed be everyone who blesses you.”
GEN.27.30	As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
GEN.27.31	He also made savoury food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.”
GEN.27.32	Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?”
GEN.27.32	He said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”
GEN.27.33	Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.”
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my father.”
GEN.27.35	He said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.”
GEN.27.36	He said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?”
GEN.27.37	Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?”
GEN.27.38	Esau said to his father, “Do you have just one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.” Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
GEN.27.39	Isaac his father answered him,
GEN.27.39	“Behold, your dwelling will be of the fatness of the earth,
GEN.27.39	and of the dew of the sky from above.
GEN.27.40	You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother.
GEN.27.40	It will happen, when you will break loose,
GEN.27.40	that you will shake his yoke from off your neck.”
GEN.27.41	Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
GEN.27.42	The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. 
GEN.27.43	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran. 
GEN.27.44	Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away— 
GEN.27.45	until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”
GEN.27.46	Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?”
GEN.28.1	Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. 
GEN.28.3	May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples, 
GEN.28.4	and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.”
GEN.28.5	Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.
GEN.28.6	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;” 
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram. 
GEN.28.8	Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father. 
GEN.28.9	So Esau went to Ishmael, and took, in addition to the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
GEN.28.10	Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went towards Haran. 
GEN.28.11	He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep. 
GEN.28.12	He dreamt and saw a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. 
GEN.28.13	Behold, the 
GEN.28.14	Your offspring will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your offspring, all the families of the earth will be blessed. 
GEN.28.15	Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you until I have done that which I have spoken of to you.”
GEN.28.16	Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, “Surely the 
GEN.28.17	He was afraid, and said, “How awesome this place is! This is none other than God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.”
GEN.28.18	Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top. 
GEN.28.19	He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. 
GEN.28.20	Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on, 
GEN.28.21	so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, and the 
GEN.28.22	then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God’s house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give a tenth to you.”
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east. 
GEN.29.2	He looked, and saw a well in the field, and saw three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well’s mouth was large. 
GEN.29.3	There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back on the well’s mouth in its place. 
GEN.29.4	Jacob said to them, “My relatives, where are you from?”
GEN.29.4	They said, “We are from Haran.”
GEN.29.5	He said to them, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?”
GEN.29.5	They said, “We know him.”
GEN.29.6	He said to them, “Is it well with him?”
GEN.29.6	They said, “It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.”
GEN.29.7	He said, “Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.”
GEN.29.8	They said, “We can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we will water the sheep.”
GEN.29.9	While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them. 
GEN.29.10	When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. 
GEN.29.11	Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 
GEN.29.12	Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative, and that he was Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father.
GEN.29.13	When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things. 
GEN.29.14	Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” Jacob stayed with him for a month. 
GEN.29.15	Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?”
GEN.29.16	Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive. 
GEN.29.18	Jacob loved Rachel. He said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.”
GEN.29.19	Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.”
GEN.29.20	Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.
GEN.29.21	Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.”
GEN.29.22	Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 
GEN.29.23	In the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. He went in to her. 
GEN.29.24	Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant. 
GEN.29.25	In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”
GEN.29.26	Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn. 
GEN.29.27	Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for seven more years.”
GEN.29.28	Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife. 
GEN.29.29	Laban gave Bilhah, his servant, to his daughter Rachel to be her servant. 
GEN.29.30	He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him seven more years.
GEN.29.31	The 
GEN.29.32	Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, “Because the 
GEN.29.33	She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, “Because the 
GEN.29.34	She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi. 
GEN.29.35	She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “This time I will praise the 
GEN.30.1	When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I will die.”
GEN.30.2	Jacob’s anger burnt against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in God’s place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”
GEN.30.3	She said, “Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.” 
GEN.30.4	She gave him Bilhah her servant as wife, and Jacob went in to her. 
GEN.30.5	Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.6	Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan. 
GEN.30.7	Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	Rachel said, “I have wrestled with my sister with mighty wrestlings, and have prevailed.” She named him Naphtali.
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her servant, and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
GEN.30.10	Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.11	Leah said, “How fortunate!” She named him Gad. 
GEN.30.12	Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.13	Leah said, “Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.” She named him Asher.
GEN.30.14	Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.15	Leah said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes, also?”
GEN.30.15	Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.16	Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.16	He lay with her that night. 
GEN.30.17	God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
GEN.30.18	Leah said, “God has given me my hire, because I gave my servant to my husband.” She named him Issachar. 
GEN.30.19	Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob. 
GEN.30.20	Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons.” She named him Zebulun. 
GEN.30.21	Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.
GEN.30.22	God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb. 
GEN.30.23	She conceived, bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.” 
GEN.30.24	She named him Joseph,
GEN.30.25	When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.”
GEN.30.27	Laban said to him, “If now I have found favour in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that the 
GEN.30.28	He said, “Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.”
GEN.30.29	Jacob said to him, “You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me. 
GEN.30.30	For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. The 
GEN.30.31	Laban said, “What shall I give you?”
GEN.30.31	Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it. 
GEN.30.32	I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one amongst the sheep, and the spotted and speckled amongst the goats. This will be my hire. 
GEN.30.33	So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted amongst the goats, and black amongst the sheep, that might be with me, will be considered stolen.”
GEN.30.34	Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.”
GEN.30.35	That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones amongst the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 
GEN.30.36	He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.
GEN.30.37	Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, and plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. 
GEN.30.38	He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink. 
GEN.30.39	The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
GEN.30.40	Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards the streaked and all the black in Laban’s flock. He put his own droves apart, and didn’t put them into Laban’s flock. 
GEN.30.41	Whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in front of the eyes of the flock in the watering troughs, that they might conceive amongst the rods; 
GEN.30.42	but when the flock were feeble, he didn’t put them in. So the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s. 
GEN.30.43	The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
GEN.31.1	Jacob heard Laban’s sons’ words, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s. He has obtained all this wealth from that which was our father’s.” 
GEN.31.2	Jacob saw the expression on Laban’s face, and, behold, it was not towards him as before. 
GEN.31.3	The 
GEN.31.4	Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock, 
GEN.31.5	and said to them, “I see the expression on your father’s face, that it is not towards me as before; but the God of my father has been with me. 
GEN.31.6	You know that I have served your father with all of my strength. 
GEN.31.7	Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t allow him to hurt me. 
GEN.31.8	If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled. If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked. 
GEN.31.9	Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me. 
GEN.31.10	During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leapt on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. 
GEN.31.11	The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’ 
GEN.31.12	He said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you. 
GEN.31.13	I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”
GEN.31.14	Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? 
GEN.31.15	Aren’t we considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and has also used up our money. 
GEN.31.16	For all the riches which God has taken away from our father are ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.”
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels, 
GEN.31.18	and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.31.19	Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the teraphim
GEN.31.20	Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away. 
GEN.31.21	So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face towards the mountain of Gilead.
GEN.31.22	Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled. 
GEN.31.23	He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.”
GEN.31.25	Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead. 
GEN.31.26	Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword? 
GEN.31.27	Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp; 
GEN.31.28	and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly. 
GEN.31.29	It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.’ 
GEN.31.30	Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my gods?”
GEN.31.31	Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.’ 
GEN.31.32	Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them.
GEN.31.33	Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn’t find them. He went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent. 
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but didn’t find them. 
GEN.31.35	She said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up before you; for I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the teraphim.
GEN.31.36	Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? 
GEN.31.37	Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.
GEN.31.38	“These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks. 
GEN.31.39	That which was torn of animals, I didn’t bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 
GEN.31.40	This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes. 
GEN.31.41	These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. 
GEN.31.42	Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”
GEN.31.43	Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine! What can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne? 
GEN.31.44	Now come, let’s make a covenant, you and I. Let it be for a witness between me and you.”
GEN.31.45	Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 
GEN.31.46	Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap. 
GEN.31.47	Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha,
GEN.31.48	Laban said, “This heap is witness between me and you today.” Therefore it was named Galeed 
GEN.31.49	and Mizpah, for he said, “The 
GEN.31.50	If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.” 
GEN.31.51	Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you. 
GEN.31.52	May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. 
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac. 
GEN.31.54	Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain. 
GEN.31.55	Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.
GEN.32.1	Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
GEN.32.2	When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now. 
GEN.32.5	I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in your sight.’” 
GEN.32.6	The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” 
GEN.32.7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two companies. 
GEN.32.8	He said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.” 
GEN.32.9	Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the 
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies. 
GEN.32.11	Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children. 
GEN.32.12	You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can’t be counted because there are so many.’”
GEN.32.13	He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother: 
GEN.32.14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. 
GEN.32.16	He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.” 
GEN.32.17	He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’ 
GEN.32.18	Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’” 
GEN.32.19	He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him. 
GEN.32.20	You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”
GEN.32.21	So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.
GEN.32.22	He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok. 
GEN.32.23	He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. 
GEN.32.24	Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day. 
GEN.32.25	When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained as he wrestled. 
GEN.32.26	The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.”
GEN.32.26	Jacob said, “I won’t let you go unless you bless me.”
GEN.32.27	He said to him, “What is your name?”
GEN.32.27	He said, “Jacob”.
GEN.32.28	He said, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.”
GEN.32.29	Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.”
GEN.32.29	He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” So he blessed him there.
GEN.32.30	Jacob called the name of the place Peniel;
GEN.32.31	The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh. 
GEN.32.32	Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.
GEN.33.1	Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two servants. 
GEN.33.2	He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. 
GEN.33.3	He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
GEN.33.4	Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept. 
GEN.33.5	He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?”
GEN.33.5	He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.” 
GEN.33.6	Then the servants came near with their children, and they bowed themselves. 
GEN.33.7	Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
GEN.33.8	Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?”
GEN.33.8	Jacob said, “To find favour in the sight of my lord.”
GEN.33.9	Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.”
GEN.33.10	Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now found favour in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me. 
GEN.33.11	Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it.
GEN.33.12	Esau said, “Let’s take our journey, and let’s go, and I will go before you.”
GEN.33.13	Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die. 
GEN.33.14	Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.”
GEN.33.15	Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with me.”
GEN.33.15	He said, “Why? Let me find favour in the sight of my lord.”
GEN.33.16	So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. 
GEN.33.17	Jacob travelled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
GEN.33.18	Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city. 
GEN.33.19	He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money. 
GEN.33.20	He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.
GEN.34.1	Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 
GEN.34.2	Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her. 
GEN.34.3	His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady. 
GEN.34.4	Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.”
GEN.34.5	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came. 
GEN.34.6	Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him. 
GEN.34.7	The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter, a thing that ought not to be done. 
GEN.34.8	Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife. 
GEN.34.9	Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. 
GEN.34.10	You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.”
GEN.34.11	Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favour in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give. 
GEN.34.12	Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife.”
GEN.34.13	The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit when they spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, 
GEN.34.14	and said to them, “We can’t do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us. 
GEN.34.15	Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised, 
GEN.34.16	then will we give our daughters to you; and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 
GEN.34.17	But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our sister,
GEN.34.18	Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. 
GEN.34.19	The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was honoured above all the house of his father. 
GEN.34.20	Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying, 
GEN.34.21	“These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let’s take their daughters to us for wives, and let’s give them our daughters. 
GEN.34.22	Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male amongst us is circumcised, as they are circumcised. 
GEN.34.23	Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let’s give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.”
GEN.34.24	All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city. 
GEN.34.25	On the third day, when they were sore, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males. 
GEN.34.26	They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away. 
GEN.34.27	Jacob’s sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
GEN.34.28	They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field, 
GEN.34.29	and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house. 
GEN.34.30	Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, amongst the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.”
GEN.34.31	They said, “Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?”
GEN.35.1	God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.”
GEN.35.2	Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are amongst you, purify yourselves, change your garments. 
GEN.35.3	Let’s arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.”
GEN.35.4	They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 
GEN.35.5	They travelled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn’t pursue the sons of Jacob. 
GEN.35.6	So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. 
GEN.35.7	He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 
GEN.35.8	Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth.
GEN.35.9	God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	God said to him, “Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel.” He named him Israel. 
GEN.35.11	God said to him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body. 
GEN.35.12	The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your offspring after you I will give the land.”
GEN.35.13	God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him. 
GEN.35.14	Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it. 
GEN.35.15	Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him “Bethel”.
GEN.35.16	They travelled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labour. 
GEN.35.17	When she was in hard labour, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for now you will have another son.”
GEN.35.18	As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Benoni,
GEN.35.19	Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem). 
GEN.35.20	Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day. 
GEN.35.21	Israel travelled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder. 
GEN.35.22	While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel heard of it.
GEN.35.22	Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. 
GEN.35.23	The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 
GEN.35.24	The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.35.25	The sons of Bilhah (Rachel’s servant): Dan and Naphtali. 
GEN.35.26	The sons of Zilpah (Leah’s servant): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. 
GEN.35.27	Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners.
GEN.35.28	The days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. 
GEN.35.29	Isaac gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.
GEN.36.1	Now this is the history of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom). 
GEN.36.2	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon, the Hittite; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite; 
GEN.36.3	and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 
GEN.36.4	Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz. Basemath bore Reuel. 
GEN.36.5	Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.36.6	Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, with his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	For their substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their travels couldn’t bear them because of their livestock. 
GEN.36.8	Esau lived in the hill country of Seir. Esau is Edom.
GEN.36.9	This is the history of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir: 
GEN.36.10	these are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; and Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau. 
GEN.36.11	The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 
GEN.36.12	Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau’s son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the descendants of Adah, Esau’s wife. 
GEN.36.13	These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the descendants of Basemath, Esau’s wife. 
GEN.36.14	These were the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
GEN.36.15	These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. 
GEN.36.17	These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. 
GEN.36.18	These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife. 
GEN.36.19	These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
GEN.36.20	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs who came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. 
GEN.36.22	The children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan’s sister was Timna. 
GEN.36.23	These are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 
GEN.36.24	These are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father. 
GEN.36.25	These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. 
GEN.36.26	These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. 
GEN.36.27	These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. 
GEN.36.28	These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 
GEN.36.29	These are the chiefs who came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah, 
GEN.36.30	chief Dishon, chief Ezer, and chief Dishan. These are the chiefs who came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.31	These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before any king reigned over the children of Israel. 
GEN.36.32	Bela, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom. The name of his city was Dinhabah. 
GEN.36.33	Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.34	Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.35	Husham died, and Hadad, the son of Bedad, who struck Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place. The name of his city was Avith. 
GEN.36.36	Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.37	Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the river, reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.38	Shaul died, and Baal Hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place. 
GEN.36.39	Baal Hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place. The name of his city was Pau. His wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
GEN.36.40	These are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau, according to their families, after their places, and by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth, 
GEN.36.41	chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	chief Magdiel, and chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.
GEN.37.1	Jacob lived in the land of his father’s travels, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.37.2	This is the history of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father. 
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a tunic of many colours. 
GEN.37.4	His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn’t speak peaceably to him.
GEN.37.5	Joseph dreamt a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more. 
GEN.37.6	He said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamt: 
GEN.37.7	for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf.”
GEN.37.8	His brothers asked him, “Will you indeed reign over us? Will you indeed have dominion over us?” They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words. 
GEN.37.9	He dreamt yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamt yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.” 
GEN.37.10	He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamt? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to the earth before you?” 
GEN.37.11	His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.
GEN.37.12	His brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.” He said to him, “Here I am.”
GEN.37.14	He said to him, “Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
GEN.37.15	A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, “What are you looking for?”
GEN.37.16	He said, “I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock.”
GEN.37.17	The man said, “They have left here, for I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’”
GEN.37.17	Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan. 
GEN.37.18	They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	They said to one another, “Behold, this dreamer comes. 
GEN.37.20	Come now therefore, and let’s kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, ‘An evil animal has devoured him.’ We will see what will become of his dreams.”
GEN.37.21	Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, “Let’s not take his life.” 
GEN.37.22	Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him”—that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. 
GEN.37.23	When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colours that was on him; 
GEN.37.24	and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.
GEN.37.25	They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. 
GEN.37.26	Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? 
GEN.37.27	Come, and let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh.” His brothers listened to him. 
GEN.37.28	Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. The merchants brought Joseph into Egypt.
GEN.37.29	Reuben returned to the pit, and saw that Joseph wasn’t in the pit; and he tore his clothes. 
GEN.37.30	He returned to his brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where will I go?” 
GEN.37.31	They took Joseph’s tunic, and killed a male goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood. 
GEN.37.32	They took the tunic of many colours, and they brought it to their father, and said, “We have found this. Examine it, now, and see if it is your son’s tunic or not.”
GEN.37.33	He recognised it, and said, “It is my son’s tunic. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.” 
GEN.37.34	Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days. 
GEN.37.35	All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, “For I will go down to Sheol
GEN.37.36	The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.
GEN.38.1	At that time, Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 
GEN.38.2	There, Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite man named Shua. He took her, and went in to her. 
GEN.38.3	She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er. 
GEN.38.4	She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan. 
GEN.38.5	She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him. 
GEN.38.6	Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the 
GEN.38.8	Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.” 
GEN.38.9	Onan knew that the offspring wouldn’t be his; and when he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother. 
GEN.38.10	The thing which he did was evil in the 
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;” for he said, “Lest he also die, like his brothers.” Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.
GEN.38.12	After many days, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite. 
GEN.38.13	Tamar was told, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” 
GEN.38.14	She took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn’t given to him as a wife. 
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. 
GEN.38.16	He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law.
GEN.38.16	She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”
GEN.38.17	He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.”
GEN.38.17	She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”
GEN.38.18	He said, “What pledge will I give you?”
GEN.38.18	She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.”
GEN.38.18	He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him. 
GEN.38.19	She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 
GEN.38.20	Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her. 
GEN.38.21	Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?”
GEN.38.21	They said, “There has been no prostitute here.”
GEN.38.22	He returned to Judah, and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.’” 
GEN.38.23	Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven’t found her.”
GEN.38.24	About three months later, Judah was told, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute. Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.”
GEN.38.24	Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burnt.” 
GEN.38.25	When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with child by the man who owns these.” She also said, “Please discern whose these are—the signet, and the cords, and the staff.”
GEN.38.26	Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.”
GEN.38.26	He knew her again no more. 
GEN.38.27	In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb. 
GEN.38.28	When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This came out first.” 
GEN.38.29	As he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “Why have you made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called Perez.
GEN.38.30	Afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.
GEN.39.1	Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there. 
GEN.39.2	The 
GEN.39.3	His master saw that the 
GEN.39.4	Joseph found favour in his sight. He ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 
GEN.39.5	From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, the 
GEN.39.6	He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.
GEN.39.6	Joseph was well-built and handsome. 
GEN.39.7	After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.”
GEN.39.8	But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand. 
GEN.39.9	No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”
GEN.39.10	As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn’t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her. 
GEN.39.11	About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside. 
GEN.39.12	She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!”
GEN.39.12	He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside. 
GEN.39.13	When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside, 
GEN.39.14	she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. 
GEN.39.15	When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.” 
GEN.39.16	She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. 
GEN.39.17	She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me, 
GEN.39.18	and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”
GEN.39.19	When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your servant did to me,” his wrath was kindled. 
GEN.39.20	Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody. 
GEN.39.21	But the 
GEN.39.22	The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it. 
GEN.39.23	The keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because the 
GEN.40.1	After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt. 
GEN.40.2	Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker. 
GEN.40.3	He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 
GEN.40.4	The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days. 
GEN.40.5	They both dreamt a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. 
GEN.40.6	Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad. 
GEN.40.7	He asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?”
GEN.40.8	They said to him, “We have dreamt a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.”
GEN.40.8	Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.”
GEN.40.9	The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me, 
GEN.40.10	and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes. 
GEN.40.11	Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.”
GEN.40.12	Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. 
GEN.40.13	Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cup bearer. 
GEN.40.14	But remember me when it is well with you. Please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. 
GEN.40.15	For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.”
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head. 
GEN.40.17	In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.”
GEN.40.18	Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days. 
GEN.40.19	Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.” 
GEN.40.20	On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker amongst his servants. 
GEN.40.21	He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand; 
GEN.40.22	but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
GEN.40.23	Yet the chief cup bearer didn’t remember Joseph, but forgot him.
GEN.41.1	At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamt, and behold, he stood by the river. 
GEN.41.2	Behold, seven cattle came up out of the river. They were sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass. 
GEN.41.3	Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river. 
GEN.41.4	The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke. 
GEN.41.5	He slept and dreamt a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good. 
GEN.41.6	Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 
GEN.41.7	The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. 
GEN.41.8	In the morning, his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt’s magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
GEN.41.9	Then the chief cup bearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my faults today. 
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, with the chief baker. 
GEN.41.11	We dreamt a dream in one night, he and I. Each man dreamt according to the interpretation of his dream. 
GEN.41.12	There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. He interpreted to each man according to his dream. 
GEN.41.13	As he interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.”
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.15	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamt a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”
GEN.41.16	Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It isn’t in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”
GEN.41.17	Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river; 
GEN.41.18	and behold, seven fat and sleek cattle came up out of the river. They fed in the marsh grass; 
GEN.41.19	and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness. 
GEN.41.20	The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle; 
GEN.41.21	and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 
GEN.41.22	I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good; 
GEN.41.23	and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 
GEN.41.24	The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”
GEN.41.25	Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh. 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one. 
GEN.41.27	The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine. 
GEN.41.28	That is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.29	Behold, seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt are coming. 
GEN.41.30	Seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, 
GEN.41.31	and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous. 
GEN.41.32	The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
GEN.41.33	“Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years. 
GEN.41.35	Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and store grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. 
GEN.41.36	The food will be to supply the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; so that the land will not perish through the famine.”
GEN.41.37	The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 
GEN.41.38	Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?” 
GEN.41.39	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has shown you all of this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you. 
GEN.41.40	You shall be over my house. All my people will be ruled according to your word. Only in the throne I will be greater than you.” 
GEN.41.41	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck. 
GEN.41.43	He made him ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.44	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh. Without you, no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.45	Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah. He gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.46	Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.47	In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly. 
GEN.41.48	He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. He stored food in each city from the fields around that city. 
GEN.41.49	Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number. 
GEN.41.50	To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. 
GEN.41.51	Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh,
GEN.41.52	The name of the second, he called Ephraim:
GEN.41.53	The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end. 
GEN.41.54	The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
GEN.41.55	When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.” 
GEN.41.56	The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.57	All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
GEN.42.1	Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” 
GEN.42.2	He said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.” 
GEN.42.3	Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to him.” 
GEN.42.5	The sons of Israel came to buy amongst those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.42.6	Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth. 
GEN.42.7	Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognised them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?”
GEN.42.7	They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”
GEN.42.8	Joseph recognised his brothers, but they didn’t recognise him. 
GEN.42.9	Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamt about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.”
GEN.42.10	They said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. 
GEN.42.11	We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.”
GEN.42.12	He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”
GEN.42.13	They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.”
GEN.42.14	Joseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’ 
GEN.42.15	By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here. 
GEN.42.16	Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.” 
GEN.42.17	He put them all together into custody for three days.
GEN.42.18	Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God. 
GEN.42.19	If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses. 
GEN.42.20	Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.”
GEN.42.20	They did so. 
GEN.42.21	They said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.” 
GEN.42.22	Reuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.” 
GEN.42.23	They didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them. 
GEN.42.24	He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from amongst them, and bound him before their eyes. 
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.
GEN.42.26	They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there. 
GEN.42.27	As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. 
GEN.42.28	He said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?” 
GEN.42.29	They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying, 
GEN.42.30	“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. 
GEN.42.31	We said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies. 
GEN.42.32	We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’ 
GEN.42.33	The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way. 
GEN.42.34	Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’”
GEN.42.35	As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. 
GEN.42.36	Jacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.”
GEN.42.37	Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.”
GEN.42.38	He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”
GEN.43.1	The famine was severe in the land. 
GEN.43.2	When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.”
GEN.43.3	Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ 
GEN.43.4	If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food; 
GEN.43.5	but if you don’t send him, we won’t go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’”
GEN.43.6	Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?”
GEN.43.7	They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down?’”
GEN.43.8	Judah said to Israel, his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones. 
GEN.43.9	I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever; 
GEN.43.10	for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.”
GEN.43.11	Their father, Israel, said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds; 
GEN.43.12	and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight. 
GEN.43.13	Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man. 
GEN.43.14	May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”
GEN.43.15	The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.”
GEN.43.17	The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house. 
GEN.43.18	The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time, we’re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.” 
GEN.43.19	They came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house, 
GEN.43.20	and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food. 
GEN.43.21	When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand. 
GEN.43.22	We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in our sacks.”
GEN.43.23	He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon out to them. 
GEN.43.24	The man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder. 
GEN.43.25	They prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
GEN.43.26	When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to the earth before him. 
GEN.43.27	He asked them of their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?”
GEN.43.28	They said, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down humbly. 
GEN.43.29	He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be gracious to you, my son.” 
GEN.43.30	Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there. 
GEN.43.31	He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.”
GEN.43.32	They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians don’t eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. 
GEN.43.33	They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marvelled with one another. 
GEN.43.34	He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.
GEN.44.1	He commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth. 
GEN.44.2	Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.” He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
GEN.44.3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded evil for good? 
GEN.44.5	Isn’t this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.’” 
GEN.44.6	He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.
GEN.44.7	They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing! 
GEN.44.8	Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house? 
GEN.44.9	With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”
GEN.44.10	He said, “Now also let it be according to your words. He with whom it is found will be my slave; and you will be blameless.”
GEN.44.11	Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack. 
GEN.44.12	He searched, beginning with the oldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
GEN.44.13	Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him. 
GEN.44.15	Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Don’t you know that such a man as I can indeed do divination?”
GEN.44.16	Judah said, “What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? How will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup is found.”
GEN.44.17	He said, “Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”
GEN.44.18	Then Judah came near to him, and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh. 
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	We said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.’ 
GEN.44.21	You said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’ 
GEN.44.22	We said to my lord, ‘The boy can’t leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’ 
GEN.44.23	You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.’ 
GEN.44.24	When we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 
GEN.44.25	Our father said, ‘Go again and buy us a little food.’ 
GEN.44.26	We said, ‘We can’t go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 
GEN.44.27	Your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons. 
GEN.44.28	One went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces;” and I haven’t seen him since. 
GEN.44.29	If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to Sheol.’
GEN.44.30	Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up in the boy’s life; 
GEN.44.31	it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the grey hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol.
GEN.44.32	For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I don’t bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.’ 
GEN.44.33	Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, my lord’s slave; and let the boy go up with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn’t with me?—lest I see the evil that will come on my father.”
GEN.45.1	Then Joseph couldn’t control himself before all those who stood before him, and he called out, “Cause everyone to go out from me!” No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 
GEN.45.2	He wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. 
GEN.45.3	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Does my father still live?”
GEN.45.3	His brothers couldn’t answer him; for they were terrified at his presence. 
GEN.45.4	Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.”
GEN.45.4	They came near. He said, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	Now don’t be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life. 
GEN.45.6	For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be no ploughing and no harvest. 
GEN.45.7	God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance. 
GEN.45.8	So now it wasn’t you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.45.9	Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says, “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t wait. 
GEN.45.10	You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children’s children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. 
GEN.45.11	There I will provide for you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.”’ 
GEN.45.12	Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you. 
GEN.45.13	You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here.” 
GEN.45.14	He fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. 
GEN.45.15	He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.
GEN.45.16	The report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. 
GEN.45.17	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.45.18	Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’ 
GEN.45.19	Now you are commanded to do this: Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. 
GEN.45.20	Also, don’t concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.”
GEN.45.21	The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 
GEN.45.22	He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing. 
GEN.45.23	He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way. 
GEN.45.24	So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, “See that you don’t quarrel on the way.”
GEN.45.25	They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father. 
GEN.45.26	They told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” His heart fainted, for he didn’t believe them. 
GEN.45.27	They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived. 
GEN.45.28	Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	Israel travelled with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac. 
GEN.46.2	God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, “Jacob, Jacob!”
GEN.46.2	He said, “Here I am.”
GEN.46.3	He said, “I am God, the God of your father. Don’t be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation. 
GEN.46.4	I will go down with you into Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph’s hand will close your eyes.”
GEN.46.5	Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
GEN.46.6	They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt—Jacob, and all his offspring with him, 
GEN.46.7	his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and he brought all his offspring with him into Egypt.
GEN.46.8	These are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn. 
GEN.46.9	The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 
GEN.46.10	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. 
GEN.46.11	The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
GEN.46.12	The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 
GEN.46.13	The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. 
GEN.46.14	The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 
GEN.46.15	These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three. 
GEN.46.16	The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 
GEN.46.17	The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 
GEN.46.18	These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls. 
GEN.46.19	The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	To Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. 
GEN.46.21	The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 
GEN.46.22	These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. 
GEN.46.23	The son of Dan: Hushim. 
GEN.46.24	The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 
GEN.46.25	These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob: all the souls were seven. 
GEN.46.26	All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct offspring, in addition to Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were sixty-six. 
GEN.46.27	The sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.
GEN.46.28	Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen. 
GEN.46.29	Joseph prepared his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 
GEN.46.30	Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.”
GEN.46.31	Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father’s house, “I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, ‘My brothers, and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me. 
GEN.46.32	These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.’ 
GEN.46.33	It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
GEN.46.34	that you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:’ that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.”
GEN.47.1	Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.2	From amongst his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.3	Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?”
GEN.47.3	They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.” 
GEN.47.4	They also said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.”
GEN.47.5	Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
GEN.47.6	The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men amongst them, then put them in charge of my livestock.”
GEN.47.7	Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.8	Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old are you?”
GEN.47.9	Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years. The days of the years of my life have been few and evil. They have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.” 
GEN.47.10	Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
GEN.47.11	Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
GEN.47.12	Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household with bread, according to the sizes of their families.
GEN.47.13	There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. 
GEN.47.14	Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. 
GEN.47.15	When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails.”
GEN.47.16	Joseph said, “Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone.”
GEN.47.17	They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year. 
GEN.47.18	When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands. 
GEN.47.19	Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be desolate.”
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh’s. 
GEN.47.21	As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it. 
GEN.47.22	Only he didn’t buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn’t sell their land. 
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. 
GEN.47.24	It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.”
GEN.47.25	They said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favour in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”
GEN.47.26	Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become Pharaoh’s.
GEN.47.27	Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. 
GEN.47.28	Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred and forty-seven years. 
GEN.47.29	The time came near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, “If now I have found favour in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt, 
GEN.47.30	but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place.”
GEN.47.30	Joseph said, “I will do as you have said.”
GEN.47.31	Israel said, “Swear to me,” and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself on the bed’s head.
GEN.48.1	After these things, someone said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
GEN.48.2	Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed. 
GEN.48.3	Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
GEN.48.4	and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’ 
GEN.48.5	Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine. 
GEN.48.6	Your offspring, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance. 
GEN.48.7	As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).”
GEN.48.8	Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?”
GEN.48.9	Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.”
GEN.48.9	He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.” 
GEN.48.10	Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see well. Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 
GEN.48.11	Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.” 
GEN.48.12	Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
GEN.48.13	Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand towards Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him. 
GEN.48.14	Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn. 
GEN.48.15	He blessed Joseph, and said,
GEN.48.15	“The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,
GEN.48.15	the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,
GEN.48.16	the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads,
GEN.48.16	and let my name be named on them,
GEN.48.16	and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.
GEN.48.16	Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.”
GEN.48.17	When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. 
GEN.48.18	Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”
GEN.48.19	His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.” 
GEN.48.20	He blessed them that day, saying, “Israel will bless in you, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh’” He set Ephraim before Manasseh. 
GEN.48.21	Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers. 
GEN.48.22	Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.”
GEN.49.1	Jacob called to his sons, and said: “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come.
GEN.49.2	Assemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob.
GEN.49.2	Listen to Israel, your father.
GEN.49.3	“Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength,
GEN.49.3	excelling in dignity, and excelling in power.
GEN.49.4	Boiling over like water, you shall not excel,
GEN.49.4	because you went up to your father’s bed,
GEN.49.4	then defiled it. He went up to my couch.
GEN.49.5	“Simeon and Levi are brothers.
GEN.49.5	Their swords are weapons of violence.
GEN.49.6	My soul, don’t come into their council.
GEN.49.6	My glory, don’t be united to their assembly;
GEN.49.6	for in their anger they killed men.
GEN.49.6	In their self-will they hamstrung cattle.
GEN.49.7	Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;
GEN.49.7	and their wrath, for it was cruel.
GEN.49.7	I will divide them in Jacob,
GEN.49.7	and scatter them in Israel.
GEN.49.8	“Judah, your brothers will praise you.
GEN.49.8	Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies.
GEN.49.8	Your father’s sons will bow down before you.
GEN.49.9	Judah is a lion’s cub.
GEN.49.9	From the prey, my son, you have gone up.
GEN.49.9	He stooped down, he crouched as a lion,
GEN.49.9	as a lioness.
GEN.49.9	Who will rouse him up?
GEN.49.10	The sceptre will not depart from Judah,
GEN.49.10	nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,
GEN.49.10	until he comes to whom it belongs.
GEN.49.10	The obedience of the peoples will be to him.
GEN.49.11	Binding his foal to the vine,
GEN.49.11	his donkey’s colt to the choice vine,
GEN.49.11	he has washed his garments in wine,
GEN.49.11	his robes in the blood of grapes.
GEN.49.12	His eyes will be red with wine,
GEN.49.12	his teeth white with milk.
GEN.49.13	“Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea.
GEN.49.13	He will be for a haven of ships.
GEN.49.13	His border will be on Sidon.
GEN.49.14	“Issachar is a strong donkey,
GEN.49.14	lying down between the saddlebags.
GEN.49.15	He saw a resting place, that it was good,
GEN.49.15	the land, that it was pleasant.
GEN.49.15	He bows his shoulder to the burden,
GEN.49.15	and becomes a servant doing forced labour.
GEN.49.16	“Dan will judge his people,
GEN.49.16	as one of the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan will be a serpent on the trail,
GEN.49.17	an adder in the path,
GEN.49.17	that bites the horse’s heels,
GEN.49.17	so that his rider falls backward.

GEN.49.22	a fruitful vine by a spring.
GEN.49.22	His branches run over the wall.
GEN.49.23	The archers have severely grieved him,
GEN.49.23	shot at him, and persecuted him:
GEN.49.24	But his bow remained strong.
GEN.49.24	The arms of his hands were made strong,
GEN.49.24	by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,
GEN.49.24	(from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),
GEN.49.25	even by the God of your father, who will help you,
GEN.49.25	by the Almighty, who will bless you,
GEN.49.25	with blessings of heaven above,
GEN.49.25	blessings of the deep that lies below,
GEN.49.25	blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
GEN.49.26	The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors,
GEN.49.26	above the boundaries of the ancient hills.
GEN.49.26	They will be on the head of Joseph,
GEN.49.26	on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers.
GEN.49.27	“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf.
GEN.49.27	In the morning he will devour the prey.
GEN.49.27	At evening he will divide the plunder.”
GEN.49.28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them, and blessed them. He blessed everyone according to his own blessing. 
GEN.49.29	He instructed them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
GEN.49.30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place. 
GEN.49.31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah: 
GEN.49.32	the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.” 
GEN.49.33	When Jacob finished charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, breathed his last breath, and was gathered to his people.
GEN.50.1	Joseph fell on his father’s face, wept on him, and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
GEN.50.3	Forty days were used for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians wept for Israel for seventy days.
GEN.50.4	When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s staff, saying, “If now I have found favour in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
GEN.50.5	‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.’”
GEN.50.6	Pharaoh said, “Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.”
GEN.50.7	Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
GEN.50.8	all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	Both chariots and horsemen went up with him. It was a very great company. 
GEN.50.10	They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days. 
GEN.50.11	When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. 
GEN.50.12	His sons did to him just as he commanded them, 
GEN.50.13	for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, as a possession for a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre. 
GEN.50.14	Joseph returned into Egypt—he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
GEN.50.15	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.” 
GEN.50.16	They sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before he died, saying, 
GEN.50.17	‘You shall tell Joseph, “Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.”’ Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 
GEN.50.18	His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, “Behold, we are your servants.” 
GEN.50.19	Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for am I in the place of God? 
GEN.50.20	As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to save many people alive, as is happening today. 
GEN.50.21	Now therefore don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your little ones.” He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
GEN.50.22	Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father’s house. Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. 
GEN.50.23	Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph’s knees. 
GEN.50.24	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” 
GEN.50.25	Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.” 
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob): 
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
EXO.1.4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	All the souls who came out of Jacob’s body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already. 
EXO.1.6	Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation. 
EXO.1.7	The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.
EXO.1.8	Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn’t know Joseph. 
EXO.1.9	He said to his people, “Behold,
EXO.1.10	Come, let’s deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies and fight against us, and escape out of the land.” 
EXO.1.11	Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses. 
EXO.1.12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They started to dread the children of Israel. 
EXO.1.13	The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve, 
EXO.1.14	and they made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.
EXO.1.15	The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah, 
EXO.1.16	and he said, “When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.” 
EXO.1.17	But the midwives feared God,
EXO.1.18	The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, “Why have you done this thing and saved the boys alive?”
EXO.1.19	The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women; for they are vigourous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.”
EXO.1.20	God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty. 
EXO.1.21	Because the midwives feared God, he gave them families. 
EXO.1.22	Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.”
EXO.2.1	A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife. 
EXO.2.2	The woman conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months. 
EXO.2.3	When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank. 
EXO.2.4	His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him. 
EXO.2.5	Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket amongst the reeds, and sent her servant to get it. 
EXO.2.6	She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”
EXO.2.7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?”
EXO.2.8	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.”
EXO.2.8	The young woman went and called the child’s mother. 
EXO.2.9	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.”
EXO.2.9	The woman took the child, and nursed it. 
EXO.2.10	The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses,
EXO.2.11	In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers. 
EXO.2.12	He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
EXO.2.13	He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?”
EXO.2.14	He said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?”
EXO.2.14	Moses was afraid, and said, “Surely this thing is known.” 
EXO.2.15	Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
EXO.2.17	The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
EXO.2.18	When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, “How is it that you have returned so early today?”
EXO.2.19	They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.”
EXO.2.20	He said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”
EXO.2.21	Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter. 
EXO.2.22	She bore a son, and he named him Gershom,
EXO.2.23	In the course of those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage. 
EXO.2.24	God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them.
EXO.3.1	Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God’s mountain, to Horeb. 
EXO.3.2	The 
EXO.3.3	Moses said, “I will go now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.”
EXO.3.4	When the 
EXO.3.4	He said, “Here I am.”
EXO.3.5	He said, “Don’t come close. Take off your sandals, for the place you are standing on is holy ground.” 
EXO.3.6	Moreover he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”
EXO.3.6	Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.
EXO.3.7	The 
EXO.3.8	I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
EXO.3.9	Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. 
EXO.3.10	Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”
EXO.3.11	Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?”
EXO.3.12	He said, “Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.”
EXO.3.13	Moses said to God, “Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what should I tell them?”
EXO.3.14	God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM,” and he said, “You shall tell the children of Israel this: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” 
EXO.3.15	God said moreover to Moses, “You shall tell the children of Israel this, ‘The 
EXO.3.16	Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, ‘The 
EXO.3.17	I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’ 
EXO.3.18	They will listen to your voice. You shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, ‘The 
EXO.3.19	I know that the king of Egypt won’t give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand. 
EXO.3.20	I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do amongst them, and after that he will let you go. 
EXO.3.21	I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed. 
EXO.3.22	But every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing. You shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians.”
EXO.4.1	Moses answered, “But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, ‘The 
EXO.4.2	The 
EXO.4.2	He said, “A rod.”
EXO.4.3	He said, “Throw it on the ground.”
EXO.4.3	He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.
EXO.4.4	The 
EXO.4.4	He stretched out his hand, and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand.
EXO.4.5	“This is so that they may believe that the 
EXO.4.6	The 
EXO.4.6	He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.
EXO.4.7	He said, “Put your hand inside your cloak again.”
EXO.4.7	He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.
EXO.4.8	“It will happen, if they will not believe you or listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 
EXO.4.9	It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.”
EXO.4.10	Moses said to the 
EXO.4.11	The 
EXO.4.12	Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak.”
EXO.4.13	Moses said, “Oh, Lord, please send someone else.”
EXO.4.14	The 
EXO.4.15	You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do. 
EXO.4.16	He will be your spokesman to the people. It will happen that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God. 
EXO.4.17	You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.”
EXO.4.18	Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.”
EXO.4.18	Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”
EXO.4.19	The 
EXO.4.20	Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took God’s rod in his hand. 
EXO.4.21	The 
EXO.4.22	You shall tell Pharaoh, ‘The 
EXO.4.23	and I have said to you, “Let my son go, that he may serve me;” and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your firstborn son.’”
EXO.4.24	On the way at a lodging place, the 
EXO.4.25	Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”
EXO.4.26	So he let him alone. Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.
EXO.4.27	The 
EXO.4.27	He went, and met him on God’s mountain, and kissed him. 
EXO.4.28	Moses told Aaron all the 
EXO.4.29	Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. 
EXO.4.30	Aaron spoke all the words which the 
EXO.4.31	The people believed, and when they heard that the 
EXO.5.1	Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, “This is what the 
EXO.5.2	Pharaoh said, “Who is the 
EXO.5.3	They said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the 
EXO.5.4	The king of Egypt said to them, “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!” 
EXO.5.5	Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens.” 
EXO.5.6	The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying, 
EXO.5.7	“You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
EXO.5.8	You shall require from them the number of the bricks which they made before. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, saying, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to our God.’ 
EXO.5.9	Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labour in it. Don’t let them pay any attention to lying words.”
EXO.5.10	The taskmasters of the people went out with their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you straw. 
EXO.5.11	Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.’” 
EXO.5.12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
EXO.5.13	The taskmasters were urgent saying, “Fulfil your work quota daily, as when there was straw!” 
EXO.5.14	The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why haven’t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?”
EXO.5.15	Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants? 
EXO.5.16	No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, ‘Make brick!’ and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.”
EXO.5.17	But Pharaoh said, “You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let’s go and sacrifice to the 
EXO.5.18	Go therefore now, and work; for no straw shall be given to you; yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!”
EXO.5.19	The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble when it was said, “You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!”
EXO.5.20	They met Moses and Aaron, who stood along the way, as they came out from Pharaoh. 
EXO.5.21	They said to them, “May the 
EXO.5.22	Moses returned to the 
EXO.5.23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people. You have not rescued your people at all!”
EXO.6.1	The 
EXO.6.2	God spoke to Moses, and said to him, “I am the 
EXO.6.3	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name the 
EXO.6.4	I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens. 
EXO.6.5	Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant. 
EXO.6.6	Therefore tell the children of Israel, ‘I am the 
EXO.6.7	I will take you to myself for a people. I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the 
EXO.6.8	I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the 
EXO.6.9	Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn’t listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
EXO.6.10	The 
EXO.6.11	“Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.”
EXO.6.12	Moses spoke before the 
EXO.6.13	The 
EXO.6.14	These are the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. 
EXO.6.15	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon. 
EXO.6.16	These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty-seven years. 
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 
EXO.6.18	The sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred and thirty-three years. 
EXO.6.19	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 
EXO.6.20	Amram took Jochebed his father’s sister to himself as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. The years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven years. 
EXO.6.21	The sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 
EXO.6.22	The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri. 
EXO.6.23	Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, as his wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 
EXO.6.24	The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. 
EXO.6.25	Eleazar Aaron’s son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites according to their families. 
EXO.6.26	These are that Aaron and Moses to whom the 
EXO.6.27	These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron.
EXO.6.28	On the day when the 
EXO.6.29	The 
EXO.6.30	Moses said before the 
EXO.7.1	The 
EXO.7.2	You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
EXO.7.3	I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.4	But Pharaoh will not listen to you, so I will lay my hand on Egypt, and bring out my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgements. 
EXO.7.5	The Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.7.6	Moses and Aaron did so. As the 
EXO.7.7	Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
EXO.7.8	The 
EXO.7.9	“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Perform a miracle!’ then you shall tell Aaron, ‘Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, and it will become a serpent.’”
EXO.7.10	Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as the 
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same thing with their enchantments. 
EXO.7.12	For they each cast down their rods, and they became serpents; but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods. 
EXO.7.13	Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t listen to them, as the 
EXO.7.14	The 
EXO.7.15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, he is going out to the water. You shall stand by the river’s bank to meet him. You shall take the rod which was turned to a serpent in your hand. 
EXO.7.16	You shall tell him, ‘The 
EXO.7.17	The 
EXO.7.18	The fish that are in the river will die and the river will become foul. The Egyptians will loathe to drink water from the river.”’” 
EXO.7.19	The 
EXO.7.20	Moses and Aaron did so, as the 
EXO.7.21	The fish that were in the river died. The river became foul. The Egyptians couldn’t drink water from the river. The blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.7.22	The magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments. So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t listen to them, as the 
EXO.7.23	Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he didn’t even take this to heart. 
EXO.7.24	All the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink; for they couldn’t drink the river water. 
EXO.7.25	Seven days were fulfilled, after the 
EXO.8.1	The 
EXO.8.2	If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your borders with frogs. 
EXO.8.3	The river will swarm with frogs, which will go up and come into your house, and into your bedroom, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs. 
EXO.8.4	The frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.”’” 
EXO.8.5	The 
EXO.8.6	Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.7	The magicians did the same thing with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, “Entreat the 
EXO.8.9	Moses said to Pharaoh, “I give you the honour of setting the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only.”
EXO.8.10	Pharaoh said, “Tomorrow.”
EXO.8.10	Moses said, “Let it be according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like the 
EXO.8.11	The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only.”
EXO.8.12	Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the 
EXO.8.13	The 
EXO.8.14	They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and didn’t listen to them, as the 
EXO.8.16	The 
EXO.8.17	They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.18	The magicians tried with their enchantments to produce lice, but they couldn’t. There were lice on man, and on animal. 
EXO.8.19	Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is God’s finger;” but Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t listen to them, as the 
EXO.8.20	The 
EXO.8.21	Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground they are on. 
EXO.8.22	I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there, to the end you may know that I am the 
EXO.8.23	I will put a division between my people and your people. This sign shall happen by tomorrow.”’” 
EXO.8.24	The 
EXO.8.25	Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!”
EXO.8.26	Moses said, “It isn’t appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the 
EXO.8.27	We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.28	Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.29	Moses said, “Behold, I am going out from you. I will pray to the 
EXO.8.30	Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to the 
EXO.8.31	The 
EXO.8.32	Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he didn’t let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still, 
EXO.9.3	behold, the 
EXO.9.4	The 
EXO.9.5	The 
EXO.9.6	The 
EXO.9.7	Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn’t let the people go.
EXO.9.8	The 
EXO.9.9	It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be boils and blisters breaking out on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt.”
EXO.9.10	They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up towards the sky; and it became boils and blisters breaking out on man and on animal. 
EXO.9.11	The magicians couldn’t stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians. 
EXO.9.12	The 
EXO.9.13	The 
EXO.9.14	For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth. 
EXO.9.15	For now I would have stretched out my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth; 
EXO.9.16	but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth, 
EXO.9.17	because you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won’t let them go. 
EXO.9.18	Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. 
EXO.9.19	Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter. The hail will come down on every man and animal that is found in the field, and isn’t brought home, and they will die.”’”
EXO.9.20	Those who feared the 
EXO.9.21	Whoever didn’t respect the 
EXO.9.22	The 
EXO.9.23	Moses stretched out his rod towards the heavens, and the 
EXO.9.24	So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
EXO.9.25	The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field. 
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.
EXO.9.27	Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “I have sinned this time. The 
EXO.9.28	Pray to the 
EXO.9.29	Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the 
EXO.9.30	But as for you and your servants, I know that you don’t yet fear the 
EXO.9.31	The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley had ripened and the flax was blooming. 
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up. 
EXO.9.33	Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to the 
EXO.9.34	When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
EXO.9.35	The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didn’t let the children of Israel go, just as the 
EXO.10.1	The 
EXO.10.2	and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your son’s son, what things I have done to Egypt, and my signs which I have done amongst them; that you may know that I am the 
EXO.10.3	Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, “This is what the 
EXO.10.4	Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country, 
EXO.10.5	and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won’t be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field. 
EXO.10.6	Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.’” He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
EXO.10.7	Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the 
EXO.10.8	Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve the 
EXO.10.9	Moses said, “We will go with our young and with our old. We will go with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds; for we must hold a feast to the 
EXO.10.10	He said to them, “The 
EXO.10.11	Not so! Go now you who are men, and serve the 
EXO.10.12	The 
EXO.10.13	Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and the 
EXO.10.14	The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, nor will there ever be again. 
EXO.10.15	For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, “I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to the 
EXO.10.18	Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to the 
EXO.10.19	The 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	The 
EXO.10.22	Moses stretched out his hand towards the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days. 
EXO.10.23	They didn’t see one another, and nobody rose from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
EXO.10.24	Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, “Go, serve the 
EXO.10.25	Moses said, “You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the 
EXO.10.26	Our livestock also shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for of it we must take to serve the 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!”
EXO.10.29	Moses said, “You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more.”
EXO.11.1	The 
EXO.11.2	Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man ask of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.” 
EXO.11.3	The 
EXO.11.4	Moses said, “This is what the 
EXO.11.5	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill, and all the firstborn of livestock. 
EXO.11.6	There will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor will be any more. 
EXO.11.7	But against any of the children of Israel a dog won’t even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal, that you may know that the 
EXO.11.8	All these servants of yours will come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, “Get out, with all the people who follow you;” and after that I will go out.’” He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
EXO.11.9	The 
EXO.11.10	Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the 
EXO.12.1	The 
EXO.12.2	“This month shall be to you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you. 
EXO.12.3	Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household; 
EXO.12.4	and if the household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbour next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls. You shall make your count for the lamb according to what everyone can eat. 
EXO.12.5	Your lamb shall be without defect, a male a year old. You shall take it from the sheep or from the goats. 
EXO.12.6	You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening. 
EXO.12.7	They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two door posts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it. 
EXO.12.8	They shall eat the meat in that night, roasted with fire, with unleavened bread. They shall eat it with bitter herbs. 
EXO.12.9	Don’t eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts. 
EXO.12.10	You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire. 
EXO.12.11	This is how you shall eat it: with your belt on your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is the 
EXO.12.12	For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal. I will execute judgements against all the gods of Egypt. I am the 
EXO.12.13	The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt. 
EXO.12.14	This day shall be a memorial for you. You shall keep it as a feast to the 
EXO.12.15	“‘Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 
EXO.12.16	In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no kind of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, only that may be done by you. 
EXO.12.17	You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever. 
EXO.12.18	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty first day of the month at evening. 
EXO.12.19	There shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a foreigner, or one who is born in the land. 
EXO.12.20	You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.’”
EXO.12.21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, “Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover. 
EXO.12.22	You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two door posts with the blood that is in the basin. None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. 
EXO.12.23	For the 
EXO.12.24	You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever. 
EXO.12.25	It shall happen when you have come to the land which the 
EXO.12.26	It will happen, when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’ 
EXO.12.27	that you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the 
EXO.12.27	The people bowed their heads and worshipped. 
EXO.12.28	The children of Israel went and did so; as the 
EXO.12.29	At midnight, the 
EXO.12.30	Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 
EXO.12.31	He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise up, get out from amongst my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the 
EXO.12.32	Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!”
EXO.12.33	The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We are all dead men.” 
EXO.12.34	The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. 
EXO.12.35	The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing. 
EXO.12.36	The 
EXO.12.37	The children of Israel travelled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, in addition to children. 
EXO.12.38	A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock. 
EXO.12.39	They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn’t leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn’t wait, and they had not prepared any food for themselves. 
EXO.12.40	Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. 
EXO.12.41	At the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the day, all of the 
EXO.12.42	It is a night to be much observed to the 
EXO.12.43	The 
EXO.12.44	but every man’s servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it. 
EXO.12.45	A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it. 
EXO.12.46	It must be eaten in one house. You shall not carry any of the meat outside of the house. Do not break any of its bones. 
EXO.12.47	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
EXO.12.48	When a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, and would like to keep the Passover to the 
EXO.12.49	One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner amongst you.” 
EXO.12.50	All the children of Israel did so. As the 
EXO.12.51	That same day, the 
EXO.13.1	The 
EXO.13.2	“Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb amongst the children of Israel, both of man and of animal. It is mine.”
EXO.13.3	Moses said to the people, “Remember this day, in which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the 
EXO.13.4	Today you go out in the month Abib. 
EXO.13.5	It shall be, when the 
EXO.13.6	Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the 
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you. No yeast shall be seen with you, within all your borders. 
EXO.13.8	You shall tell your son in that day, saying, ‘It is because of that which the 
EXO.13.9	It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the 
EXO.13.10	You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
EXO.13.11	“It shall be, when the 
EXO.13.12	that you shall set apart to the 
EXO.13.13	Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man amongst your sons. 
EXO.13.14	It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ that you shall tell him, ‘By strength of hand the 
EXO.13.15	When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the 
EXO.13.16	It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes; for by strength of hand the 
EXO.13.17	When Pharaoh had let the people go, God didn’t lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt”; 
EXO.13.18	but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt. 
EXO.13.19	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the children of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you.” 
EXO.13.20	They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
EXO.13.21	The 
EXO.13.22	the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn’t depart from before the people.
EXO.14.1	The 
EXO.14.2	“Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea. 
EXO.14.3	Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, ‘They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.’ 
EXO.14.4	I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get honour over Pharaoh, and over all his armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.14.5	The king of Egypt was told that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?” 
EXO.14.6	He prepared his chariot, and took his army with him; 
EXO.14.7	and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, with captains over all of them. 
EXO.14.8	The 
EXO.14.9	The Egyptians pursued them. All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
EXO.14.10	When Pharaoh came near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to the 
EXO.14.11	They said to Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us out of Egypt? 
EXO.14.12	Isn’t this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?’ For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”
EXO.14.13	Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	The 
EXO.14.16	Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. Then the children of Israel shall go into the middle of the sea on dry ground. 
EXO.14.17	Behold, I myself will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in after them. I will get myself honour over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots, and over his horsemen. 
EXO.14.18	The Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.14.19	The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them. 
EXO.14.20	It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. There was the cloud and the darkness, yet it gave light by night. One didn’t come near the other all night.
EXO.14.21	Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the 
EXO.14.22	The children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. 
EXO.14.23	The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the middle of the sea: all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
EXO.14.24	In the morning watch, the 
EXO.14.25	He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, “Let’s flee from the face of Israel, for the 
EXO.14.26	The 
EXO.14.27	Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. The 
EXO.14.28	The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh’s army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them. 
EXO.14.29	But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. 
EXO.14.30	Thus the 
EXO.14.31	Israel saw the great work which the 
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the 
EXO.15.1	“I will sing to the 
EXO.15.1	He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.
EXO.15.2	The 
EXO.15.2	He has become my salvation.
EXO.15.2	This is my God, and I will praise him;
EXO.15.2	my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.4	He has cast Pharaoh’s chariots and his army into the sea.
EXO.15.4	His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.
EXO.15.5	The deeps cover them.
EXO.15.5	They went down into the depths like a stone.
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, 
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, 
EXO.15.7	In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you.
EXO.15.7	You send out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.
EXO.15.8	With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up.
EXO.15.8	The floods stood upright as a heap.
EXO.15.8	The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, ‘I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the plunder.
EXO.15.9	My desire will be satisfied on them.
EXO.15.9	I will draw my sword. My hand will destroy them.’
EXO.15.10	You blew with your wind.
EXO.15.10	The sea covered them.
EXO.15.10	They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	Who is like you, 
EXO.15.11	Who is like you, glorious in holiness,
EXO.15.11	fearful in praises, doing wonders?
EXO.15.12	You stretched out your right hand.
EXO.15.12	The earth swallowed them.
EXO.15.13	“You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed.
EXO.15.13	You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.
EXO.15.14	The peoples have heard.
EXO.15.14	They tremble.
EXO.15.14	Pangs have taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.
EXO.15.15	Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed.
EXO.15.15	Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab.
EXO.15.15	All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
EXO.15.16	Terror and dread falls on them.
EXO.15.16	By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone,
EXO.15.16	until your people pass over, 
EXO.15.16	until the people you have purchased pass over.
EXO.15.17	You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,

EXO.15.20	Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances. 
EXO.15.21	Miriam answered them,
EXO.15.21	“Sing to the 
EXO.15.21	He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.”
EXO.15.22	Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 
EXO.15.23	When they came to Marah, they couldn’t drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore its name was called Marah.
EXO.15.24	The people murmured against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?” 
EXO.15.25	Then he cried to the 
EXO.15.26	He said, “If you will diligently listen to the 
EXO.15.27	They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. They encamped there by the waters.
EXO.16.1	They took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 
EXO.16.2	The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness; 
EXO.16.3	and the children of Israel said to them, “We wish that we had died by the 
EXO.16.4	Then the 
EXO.16.5	It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”
EXO.16.6	Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, “At evening, you shall know that the 
EXO.16.7	In the morning, you shall see the 
EXO.16.8	Moses said, “Now the 
EXO.16.9	Moses said to Aaron, “Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come close to the 
EXO.16.10	As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, the 
EXO.16.11	The 
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the 
EXO.16.13	In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp. 
EXO.16.14	When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground. 
EXO.16.15	When the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they didn’t know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread which the 
EXO.16.16	This is the thing which the 
EXO.16.17	The children of Israel did so, and some gathered more, some less. 
EXO.16.18	When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They each gathered according to his eating. 
EXO.16.19	Moses said to them, “Let no one leave of it until the morning.” 
EXO.16.20	Notwithstanding they didn’t listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, so it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them. 
EXO.16.21	They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted. 
EXO.16.22	On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
EXO.16.23	He said to them, “This is that which the 
EXO.16.24	They laid it up until the morning, as Moses ordered, and it didn’t become foul, and there were no worms in it. 
EXO.16.25	Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the 
EXO.16.26	Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none.” 
EXO.16.27	On the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none. 
EXO.16.28	The 
EXO.16.29	Behold, because the 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	The house of Israel called its name “Manna”,
EXO.16.32	Moses said, “This is the thing which the 
EXO.16.33	Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before the 
EXO.16.34	As the 
EXO.16.35	The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan. 
EXO.16.36	Now an omer is one tenth of an ephah.
EXO.17.1	All the congregation of the children of Israel travelled from the wilderness of Sin, starting according to the 
EXO.17.2	Therefore the people quarrelled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.”
EXO.17.2	Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the 
EXO.17.3	The people were thirsty for water there; so the people murmured against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?”
EXO.17.4	Moses cried to the 
EXO.17.5	The 
EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
EXO.17.7	He called the name of the place Massah,
EXO.17.8	Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
EXO.17.9	Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us, and go out to fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God’s rod in my hand.” 
EXO.17.10	So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. When he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
EXO.17.12	But Moses’ hands were heavy; so they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset. 
EXO.17.13	Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
EXO.17.14	The 
EXO.17.15	Moses built an altar, and called its name “The 
EXO.17.16	He said, “The 
EXO.18.1	Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the 
EXO.18.2	Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away, 
EXO.18.3	and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom,
EXO.18.4	The name of the other was Eliezer,
EXO.18.5	Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with Moses’ sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God. 
EXO.18.6	He said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her.”
EXO.18.7	Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent. 
EXO.18.8	Moses told his father-in-law all that the 
EXO.18.9	Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the 
EXO.18.10	Jethro said, “Blessed be the 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the 
EXO.18.12	Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
EXO.18.13	On the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening. 
EXO.18.14	When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, “What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?”
EXO.18.15	Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to enquire of God. 
EXO.18.16	When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbour, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.” 
EXO.18.17	Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good. 
EXO.18.18	You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone. 
EXO.18.19	Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God. 
EXO.18.20	You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
EXO.18.21	Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men which fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
EXO.18.22	Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you. 
EXO.18.23	If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.”
EXO.18.24	So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. 
EXO.18.25	Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
EXO.18.26	They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard cases to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 
EXO.18.27	Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.
EXO.19.1	In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. 
EXO.19.2	When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain. 
EXO.19.3	Moses went up to God, and the 
EXO.19.4	‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to myself. 
EXO.19.5	Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from amongst all peoples; for all the earth is mine; 
EXO.19.6	and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.”
EXO.19.7	Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the 
EXO.19.8	All the people answered together, and said, “All that the 
EXO.19.8	Moses reported the words of the people to the 
EXO.19.9	The 
EXO.19.10	The 
EXO.19.11	and be ready for the third day; for on the third day the 
EXO.19.12	You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death. 
EXO.19.13	No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.”
EXO.19.14	Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 
EXO.19.15	He said to the people, “Be ready by the third day. Don’t have sexual relations with a woman.”
EXO.19.16	On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled. 
EXO.19.17	Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain. 
EXO.19.18	All of Mount Sinai smoked, because the 
EXO.19.19	When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice. 
EXO.19.20	The 
EXO.19.21	The 
EXO.19.22	Let the priests also, who come near to the 
EXO.19.23	Moses said to the 
EXO.19.24	The 
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down to the people, and told them.
EXO.20.1	God
EXO.20.2	“I am the 
EXO.20.3	“You shall have no other gods before me.
EXO.20.4	“You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 
EXO.20.5	you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, the 
EXO.20.6	and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
EXO.20.7	“You shall not misuse the name of the 
EXO.20.8	“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
EXO.20.9	You shall labour six days, and do all your work, 
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the 
EXO.20.11	for in six days the 
EXO.20.12	“Honour your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the 
EXO.20.13	“You shall not murder.
EXO.20.14	“You shall not commit adultery.
EXO.20.15	“You shall not steal.
EXO.20.16	“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbour.
EXO.20.17	“You shall not covet your neighbour’s house. You shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbour’s.”
EXO.20.18	All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance. 
EXO.20.19	They said to Moses, “Speak with us yourself, and we will listen; but don’t let God speak with us, lest we die.”
EXO.20.20	Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his fear may be before you, that you won’t sin.” 
EXO.20.21	The people stayed at a distance, and Moses came near to the thick darkness where God was.
EXO.20.22	The 
EXO.20.23	You shall most certainly not make gods of silver or gods of gold for yourselves to be alongside me. 
EXO.20.24	You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you. 
EXO.20.25	If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it. 
EXO.20.26	You shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.’
EXO.21.1	“Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them:
EXO.21.2	“If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything. 
EXO.21.3	If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself. If he is married, then his wife shall go out with him. 
EXO.21.4	If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself. 
EXO.21.5	But if the servant shall plainly say, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children. I will not go out free;’ 
EXO.21.6	then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him forever.
EXO.21.7	“If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not go out as the male servants do. 
EXO.21.8	If she doesn’t please her master, who has married her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her. 
EXO.21.9	If he marries her to his son, he shall deal with her as a daughter. 
EXO.21.10	If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marital rights. 
EXO.21.11	If he doesn’t do these three things for her, she may go free without paying any money.
EXO.21.12	“One who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death, 
EXO.21.13	but not if it is unintentional, but God allows it to happen; then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee. 
EXO.21.14	If a man schemes and comes presumptuously on his neighbour to kill him, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.
EXO.21.15	“Anyone who attacks his father or his mother shall be surely put to death.
EXO.21.16	“Anyone who kidnaps someone and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
EXO.21.17	“Anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
EXO.21.18	“If men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he doesn’t die, but is confined to bed; 
EXO.21.19	if he rises again and walks around with his staff, then he who struck him shall be cleared; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for his healing until he is thoroughly healed.
EXO.21.20	“If a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod, and he dies under his hand, the man shall surely be punished. 
EXO.21.21	Notwithstanding, if his servant gets up after a day or two, he shall not be punished, for the servant is his property.
EXO.21.22	“If men fight and hurt a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely, and yet no harm follows, he shall be surely fined as much as the woman’s husband demands and the judges allow. 
EXO.21.23	But if any harm follows, then you must take life for life, 
EXO.21.24	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
EXO.21.25	burning for burning, wound for wound, and bruise for bruise.
EXO.21.26	“If a man strikes his servant’s eye, or his maid’s eye, and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake. 
EXO.21.27	If he strikes out his male servant’s tooth, or his female servant’s tooth, he shall let the servant go free for his tooth’s sake.
EXO.21.28	“If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull shall surely be stoned, and its meat shall not be eaten; but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible. 
EXO.21.29	But if the bull had a habit of goring in the past, and this has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in, but it has killed a man or a woman, the bull shall be stoned, and its owner shall also be put to death. 
EXO.21.30	If a ransom is imposed on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is imposed. 
EXO.21.31	Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter, according to this judgement it shall be done to him. 
EXO.21.32	If the bull gores a male servant or a female servant, thirty shekels
EXO.21.33	“If a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and doesn’t cover it, and a bull or a donkey falls into it, 
EXO.21.34	the owner of the pit shall make it good. He shall give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall be his.
EXO.21.35	“If one man’s bull injures another’s, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live bull, and divide its price; and they shall also divide the dead animal. 
EXO.21.36	Or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of goring in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall surely pay bull for bull, and the dead animal shall be his own.
EXO.22.1	“If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. 
EXO.22.2	If the thief is found breaking in, and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him. 
EXO.22.3	If the sun has risen on him, he is guilty of bloodshed. He shall make restitution. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. 
EXO.22.4	If the stolen property is found in his hand alive, whether it is ox, donkey, or sheep, he shall pay double.
EXO.22.5	“If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten by letting his animal loose, and it grazes in another man’s field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field, and from the best of his own vineyard.
EXO.22.6	“If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
EXO.22.7	“If a man delivers to his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the man’s house, if the thief is found, he shall pay double. 
EXO.22.8	If the thief isn’t found, then the master of the house shall come near to God, to find out whether or not he has put his hand on his neighbour’s goods. 
EXO.22.9	For every matter of trespass, whether it is for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any kind of lost thing, about which one says, ‘This is mine,’ the cause of both parties shall come before God. He whom God condemns shall pay double to his neighbour.

EXO.22.13	If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it for evidence. He shall not make good that which was torn.
EXO.22.14	“If a man borrows anything of his neighbour’s, and it is injured, or dies, its owner not being with it, he shall surely make restitution. 
EXO.22.15	If its owner is with it, he shall not make it good. If it is a leased thing, it came for its lease.
EXO.22.16	“If a man entices a virgin who isn’t pledged to be married, and lies with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife. 
EXO.22.17	If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
EXO.22.18	“You shall not allow a sorceress to live.
EXO.22.19	“Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death.

EXO.22.22	“You shall not take advantage of any widow or fatherless child. 
EXO.22.23	If you take advantage of them at all, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry; 
EXO.22.24	and my wrath will grow hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
EXO.22.25	“If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be to him as a creditor. You shall not charge him interest. 
EXO.22.26	If you take your neighbour’s garment as collateral, you shall restore it to him before the sun goes down, 
EXO.22.27	for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin. What would he sleep in? It will happen, when he cries to me, that I will hear, for I am gracious.
EXO.22.28	“You shall not blaspheme God, nor curse a ruler of your people.
EXO.22.29	“You shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses.

EXO.23.1	“You shall not spread a false report. Don’t join your hand with the wicked to be a malicious witness.
EXO.23.2	“You shall not follow a crowd to do evil. You shall not testify in court to side with a multitude to pervert justice. 
EXO.23.3	You shall not favour a poor man in his cause.
EXO.23.4	“If you meet your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you shall surely bring it back to him again. 
EXO.23.5	If you see the donkey of him who hates you fallen down under his burden, don’t leave him. You shall surely help him with it.
EXO.23.6	“You shall not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits.
EXO.23.7	“Keep far from a false charge, and don’t kill the innocent and righteous; for I will not justify the wicked.
EXO.23.8	“You shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds those who have sight and perverts the words of the righteous.
EXO.23.9	“You shall not oppress an alien, for you know the heart of an alien, since you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
EXO.23.10	“For six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather in its increase, 
EXO.23.11	but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave the animal of the field shall eat. In the same way, you shall deal with your vineyard and with your olive grove.
EXO.23.12	“Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest, that your ox and your donkey may have rest, and the son of your servant, and the alien may be refreshed.

EXO.29.35	“You shall do so to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. You shall consecrate them seven days. 
EXO.29.36	Every day you shall offer the bull of sin offering for atonement. You shall cleanse the altar when you make atonement for it. You shall anoint it, to sanctify it. 
EXO.29.37	Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and the altar shall be most holy. Whatever touches the altar shall be holy.
EXO.29.38	“Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually. 
EXO.29.39	The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at evening; 
EXO.29.40	and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah
EXO.29.41	The other lamb you shall offer at evening, and shall do to it according to the meal offering of the morning and according to its drink offering, for a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to the

EXO.29.43	There I will meet with the children of Israel; and the place shall be sanctified by my glory. 
EXO.29.44	I will sanctify the Tent of Meeting and the altar. I will also sanctify Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest’s office. 
EXO.29.45	I will dwell amongst the children of Israel, and will be their God. 
EXO.29.46	They shall know that I am the

EXO.30.2	Its length shall be a cubit,
EXO.30.3	You shall overlay it with pure gold, its top, its sides around it, and its horns; and you shall make a gold moulding around it. 
EXO.30.4	You shall make two golden rings for it under its moulding; on its two ribs, on its two sides you shall make them; and they shall be for places for poles with which to bear it. 
EXO.30.5	You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 
EXO.30.6	You shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the covenant, before the mercy seat that is over the covenant, where I will meet with you. 
EXO.30.7	Aaron shall burn incense of sweet spices on it every morning. When he tends the lamps, he shall burn it. 
EXO.30.8	When Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the 
EXO.30.9	You shall offer no strange incense on it, nor burnt offering, nor meal offering; and you shall pour no drink offering on it. 
EXO.30.10	Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once in the year; with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once in the year he shall make atonement for it throughout your generations. It is most holy to the

EXO.30.14	Everyone who passes over to those who are counted, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering to the 
EXO.30.15	The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel,
EXO.30.16	You shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the Tent of Meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before the 
EXO.30.17	The 
EXO.30.18	“You shall also make a basin of bronze, and its base of bronze, in which to wash. You shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it. 
EXO.30.19	Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it. 
EXO.30.20	When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to the 
EXO.30.21	So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die. This shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his descendants throughout their generations.”
EXO.30.22	Moreover the 
EXO.30.23	“Also take fine spices: of liquid myrrh, five hundred shekels;
EXO.30.24	and of cassia five hundred, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; and a hin

EXO.30.26	You shall use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the covenant,

EXO.30.30	You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest’s office. 
EXO.30.31	You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘This shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations. 
EXO.30.32	It shall not be poured on man’s flesh, and do not make any like it, according to its composition. It is holy. It shall be holy to you. 
EXO.30.33	Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.’”
EXO.30.34	The 
EXO.30.35	You shall make incense of it, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy. 
EXO.30.36	You shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before the covenant in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be to you most holy. 
EXO.30.37	You shall not make this incense, according to its composition, for yourselves: it shall be to you holy for the 
EXO.30.38	Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it, he shall be cut off from his people.”
EXO.31.1	The 
EXO.31.2	“Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 
EXO.31.3	I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship, 
EXO.31.4	to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, 
EXO.31.5	and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship. 
EXO.31.6	Behold, I myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you: 
EXO.31.7	the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent, 
EXO.31.8	the table and its vessels, the pure lamp stand with all its vessels, the altar of incense, 
EXO.31.9	the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base, 
EXO.31.10	the finely worked garments—the holy garments for Aaron the priest, the garments of his sons to minister in the priest’s office— 
EXO.31.11	the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do.”
EXO.31.12	The 
EXO.31.13	“Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths; for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the 
EXO.31.14	You shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from amongst his people. 
EXO.31.15	Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the 
EXO.31.16	Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
EXO.31.17	It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days the 
EXO.31.18	When he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave Moses the two tablets of the covenant, stone tablets, written with God’s finger.
EXO.32.1	When the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.”
EXO.32.2	Aaron said to them, “Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.”
EXO.32.3	All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron. 
EXO.32.4	He received what they handed him, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a moulded calf. Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”
EXO.32.5	When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the 
EXO.32.6	They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
EXO.32.7	The 
EXO.32.8	They have turned away quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a moulded calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’”
EXO.32.9	The 
EXO.32.10	Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.”
EXO.32.11	Moses begged the 
EXO.32.12	Why should the Egyptians talk, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and turn away from this evil against your people. 
EXO.32.13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring
EXO.32.14	So The 
EXO.32.15	Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides. They were written on one side and on the other. 
EXO.32.16	The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
EXO.32.17	When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the noise of war in the camp.”
EXO.32.18	He said, “It isn’t the voice of those who shout for victory. It is not the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear.” 
EXO.32.19	As soon as he came near to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Then Moses’ anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain. 
EXO.32.20	He took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink it.
EXO.32.21	Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?”
EXO.32.22	Aaron said, “Don’t let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil. 
EXO.32.23	For they said to me, ‘Make us gods, which shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.’ 
EXO.32.24	I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them take it off.’ So they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”
EXO.32.25	When Moses saw that the people were out of control, (for Aaron had let them lose control, causing derision amongst their enemies), 
EXO.32.26	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on the 
EXO.32.26	All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him. 
EXO.32.27	He said to them, “The 
EXO.32.28	The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. About three thousand men fell of the people that day. 
EXO.32.29	Moses said, “Consecrate yourselves today to the 
EXO.32.30	On the next day, Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to the 
EXO.32.31	Moses returned to the 
EXO.32.32	Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written.”
EXO.32.33	The 
EXO.32.34	Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin.” 
EXO.32.35	The 
EXO.33.1	The 
EXO.33.2	I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
EXO.33.3	Go to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up amongst you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you on the way.”
EXO.33.4	When the people heard this evil news, they mourned; and no one put on his jewellery.
EXO.33.5	The 
EXO.33.6	The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewellery from Mount Horeb onward.
EXO.33.7	Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it “The Tent of Meeting.” Everyone who sought the 
EXO.33.8	When Moses went out to the Tent, all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent. 
EXO.33.9	When Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and the 
EXO.33.10	All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshipped, everyone at their tent door. 
EXO.33.11	The 
EXO.33.12	Moses said to the 
EXO.33.13	Now therefore, if I have found favour in your sight, please show me your way, now, that I may know you, so that I may find favour in your sight; and consider that this nation is your people.”
EXO.33.14	He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
EXO.33.15	Moses said to him, “If your presence doesn’t go with me, don’t carry us up from here. 
EXO.33.16	For how would people know that I have found favour in your sight, I and your people? Isn’t it that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?”
EXO.33.17	The 
EXO.33.18	Moses said, “Please show me your glory.”
EXO.33.19	He said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the 
EXO.33.20	He said, “You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live.” 
EXO.33.21	The 
EXO.33.22	It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; 
EXO.33.23	then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen.”
EXO.34.1	The 
EXO.34.2	Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain. 
EXO.34.3	No one shall come up with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain. Do not let the flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain.”
EXO.34.4	He chiselled two tablets of stone like the first; then Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as the 
EXO.34.5	The 
EXO.34.6	The 
EXO.34.7	keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children’s children, on the third and on the fourth generation.”
EXO.34.8	Moses hurried and bowed his head towards the earth, and worshipped. 
EXO.34.9	He said, “If now I have found favour in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go amongst us, even though this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.”
EXO.34.10	He said, “Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people amongst whom you are shall see the work of the 
EXO.34.11	Observe that which I command you today. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
EXO.34.12	Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare amongst you; 
EXO.34.13	but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherah poles; 
EXO.34.14	for you shall worship no other god; for the 
EXO.34.15	“Don’t make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice; 
EXO.34.16	and you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods.
EXO.34.17	“You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.
EXO.34.18	“You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out of Egypt.
EXO.34.19	“All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep. 
EXO.34.20	You shall redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb. If you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear before me empty.
EXO.34.21	“Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in ploughing time and in harvest you shall rest.
EXO.34.22	“You shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at the year’s end. 
EXO.34.23	Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 
EXO.34.24	For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before the 
EXO.34.25	“You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread. The sacrifice of the feast of the Passover shall not be left to the morning.
EXO.34.26	“You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of the 
EXO.34.26	“You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
EXO.34.27	The 
EXO.34.28	He was there with the 
EXO.34.29	When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mountain, Moses didn’t know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him. 
EXO.34.30	When Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him. 
EXO.34.31	Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them. 
EXO.34.32	Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all the commandments that the 
EXO.34.33	When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face. 
EXO.34.34	But when Moses went in before the 
EXO.34.35	The children of Israel saw Moses’ face, that the skin of Moses’ face shone; so Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
EXO.35.1	Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, “These are the words which the 
EXO.35.2	‘Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of solemn rest to the 
EXO.35.3	You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the Sabbath day.’”
EXO.35.4	Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “This is the thing which the 
EXO.35.5	‘Take from amongst you an offering to the 
EXO.35.6	blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats’ hair, 
EXO.35.7	rams’ skins dyed red, sea cow hides, acacia wood, 
EXO.35.8	oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense, 
EXO.35.9	onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.
EXO.35.10	“‘Let every wise-hearted man amongst you come, and make all that the 
EXO.35.11	the tabernacle, its outer covering, its roof, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 
EXO.35.12	the ark, and its poles, the mercy seat, the veil of the screen; 
EXO.35.13	the table with its poles and all its vessels, and the show bread; 
EXO.35.14	the lamp stand also for the light, with its vessels, its lamps, and the oil for the light; 
EXO.35.15	and the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle; 
EXO.35.16	the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its vessels, the basin and its base; 
EXO.35.17	the hangings of the court, its pillars, their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court; 
EXO.35.18	the pins of the tabernacle, the pins of the court, and their cords; 
EXO.35.19	the finely worked garments for ministering in the holy place—the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons—to minister in the priest’s office.’”
EXO.35.20	All the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
EXO.35.21	They came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and brought the 
EXO.35.22	They came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man who offered an offering of gold to the 
EXO.35.23	Everyone with whom was found blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats’ hair, rams’ skins dyed red, and sea cow hides, brought them. 
EXO.35.24	Everyone who offered an offering of silver and bronze brought the 
EXO.35.25	All the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun: the blue, the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen. 
EXO.35.26	All the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats’ hair. 
EXO.35.27	The rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate; 
EXO.35.28	with the spice and the oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 
EXO.35.29	The children of Israel brought a free will offering to the 
EXO.35.30	Moses said to the children of Israel, “Behold, the 
EXO.35.31	He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship; 
EXO.35.32	and to make skilful works, to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, 
EXO.35.33	in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of skilful workmanship. 
EXO.35.34	He has put in his heart that he may teach, both he and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
EXO.35.35	He has filled them with wisdom of heart to work all kinds of workmanship, of the engraver, of the skilful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any workmanship, and of those who make skilful works.
EXO.36.1	“Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise-hearted man, in whom the 
EXO.36.2	Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart the 
EXO.36.3	They received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. They kept bringing free will offerings to him every morning. 
EXO.36.4	All the wise men, who performed all the work of the sanctuary, each came from his work which he did. 
EXO.36.5	They spoke to Moses, saying, “The people have brought much more than enough for the service of the work which the 
EXO.36.6	Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, “Let neither man nor woman make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing. 
EXO.36.7	For the stuff they had was sufficient to do all the work, and too much.
EXO.36.8	All the wise-hearted men amongst those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet. They made them with cherubim, the work of a skilful workman. 
EXO.36.9	The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits,
EXO.36.10	He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another. 
EXO.36.11	He made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the edge in the coupling. Likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second coupling. 
EXO.36.12	He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling. The loops were opposite to one another. 
EXO.36.13	He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains to one another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was a unit.
EXO.36.14	He made curtains of goats’ hair for a covering over the tabernacle. He made them eleven curtains. 
EXO.36.15	The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the width of each curtain. The eleven curtains had one measure. 
EXO.36.16	He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 
EXO.36.17	He made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the coupling, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain which was outermost in the second coupling. 
EXO.36.18	He made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together, that it might be a unit. 
EXO.36.19	He made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of sea cow hides above.
EXO.36.20	He made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up. 
EXO.36.21	Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the width of each board. 
EXO.36.22	Each board had two tenons, joined to one another. He made all the boards of the tabernacle this way. 
EXO.36.23	He made the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward. 
EXO.36.24	He made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards: two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 
EXO.36.25	For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards 
EXO.36.26	and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
EXO.36.27	For the far part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
EXO.36.28	He made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle in the far part. 
EXO.36.29	They were double beneath, and in the same way they were all the way to its top to one ring. He did this to both of them in the two corners. 
EXO.36.30	There were eight boards and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets—under every board two sockets.
EXO.36.31	He made bars of acacia wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 
EXO.36.32	and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward. 
EXO.36.33	He made the middle bar to pass through in the middle of the boards from the one end to the other.

LEV.8.4	Moses did as the 
LEV.8.5	Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing which the 
LEV.8.6	Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 
LEV.8.7	He put the tunic on him, tied the sash on him, clothed him with the robe, put the ephod on him, and he tied the skilfully woven band of the ephod on him and fastened it to him with it. 
LEV.8.8	He placed the breastplate on him. He put the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate. 
LEV.8.9	He set the turban on his head. He set the golden plate, the holy crown, on the front of the turban, as the 
LEV.8.10	Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them. 
LEV.8.11	He sprinkled it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the basin and its base, to sanctify them. 
LEV.8.12	He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. 
LEV.8.13	Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and tied sashes on them, and put headbands on them, as the 
LEV.8.14	He brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. 
LEV.8.15	He killed it; and Moses took the blood, and put it around on the horns of the altar with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it. 
LEV.8.16	He took all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burnt it on the altar. 
LEV.8.17	But the bull, and its skin, and its meat, and its dung, he burnt with fire outside the camp, as the 
LEV.8.18	He presented the ram of the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.19	He killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar. 
LEV.8.20	He cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat. 
LEV.8.21	He washed the innards and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to the 
LEV.8.22	He presented the other ram, the ram of consecration. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.23	He killed it; and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot. 
LEV.8.24	He brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar.

LEV.8.26	and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the 
LEV.8.27	He put all these in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the 
LEV.8.28	Moses took them from their hands, and burnt them on the altar on the burnt offering. They were a consecration offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to the 
LEV.8.29	Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the 
LEV.8.30	Moses took some of the anointing oil, and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.
LEV.8.31	Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’ 
LEV.8.32	What remains of the meat and of the bread you shall burn with fire.

LEV.8.35	You shall stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night seven days, and keep the 
LEV.8.36	Aaron and his sons did all the things which the 
LEV.9.1	On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

LEV.9.5	They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting. All the congregation came near and stood before the 
LEV.9.6	Moses said, “This is the thing which the 
LEV.9.7	Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as the 
LEV.9.8	So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 
LEV.9.9	The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar; 
LEV.9.10	but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar, as the 
LEV.9.11	The meat and the skin he burnt with fire outside the camp. 
LEV.9.12	He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 
LEV.9.13	They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head. He burnt them upon the altar. 
LEV.9.14	He washed the innards and the legs, and burnt them on the burnt offering on the altar. 
LEV.9.15	He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first. 
LEV.9.16	He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. 
LEV.9.17	He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burnt it upon the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning. 
LEV.9.18	He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people. Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar; 
LEV.9.19	and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver; 
LEV.9.20	and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat on the altar. 
LEV.9.21	Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh for a wave offering before the 
LEV.9.22	Aaron lifted up his hands towards the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
LEV.9.23	Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and the 
LEV.9.24	Fire came out from before the 
LEV.10.1	Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before the 
LEV.10.2	Fire came out from before the 
LEV.10.3	Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the 
LEV.10.3	‘I will show myself holy to those who come near me,
LEV.10.3	and before all the people I will be glorified.’”
LEV.10.3	Aaron held his peace. 
LEV.10.4	Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.” 
LEV.10.5	So they came near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said.
LEV.10.6	Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Don’t let the hair of your heads go loose, and don’t tear your clothes, so that you don’t die, and so that he will not be angry with all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the 
LEV.10.7	You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of the

LEV.10.11	You are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the 
LEV.10.12	Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, “Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of the 
LEV.10.13	and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons’ portion, of the offerings of the 
LEV.10.14	The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel. 
LEV.10.15	They shall bring the heaved thigh and the waved breast with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the 
LEV.10.16	Moses diligently enquired about the goat of the sin offering, and, behold,
LEV.10.17	“Why haven’t you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and he has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the 
LEV.10.18	Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.”
LEV.10.19	Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the 
LEV.10.20	When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight.

LEV.13.1	The 
LEV.13.2	“When a man shall have a swelling in his body’s skin, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes in the skin of his body the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests. 
LEV.13.3	The priest shall examine the plague in the skin of the body. If the hair in the plague has turned white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the body’s skin, it is the plague of leprosy; so the priest shall examine him and pronounce him unclean. 
LEV.13.4	If the bright spot is white in the skin of his body, and its appearance isn’t deeper than the skin, and its hair hasn’t turned white, then the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days. 
LEV.13.5	The priest shall examine him on the seventh day. Behold, if in his eyes the plague is arrested and the plague hasn’t spread in the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days. 
LEV.13.6	The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day. Behold, if the plague has faded and the plague hasn’t spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. It is a scab. He shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 
LEV.13.7	But if the scab spreads on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again. 
LEV.13.8	The priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is leprosy.
LEV.13.9	“When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest; 
LEV.13.10	and the priest shall examine him. Behold, if there is a white swelling in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling, 
LEV.13.11	it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not isolate him, for he is already unclean.
LEV.13.12	“If the leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the infected person from his head even to his feet, as far as it appears to the priest, 
LEV.13.13	then the priest shall examine him. Behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean of the plague. It has all turned white: he is clean. 
LEV.13.14	But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean. 
LEV.13.15	The priest shall examine the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean. It is leprosy. 
LEV.13.16	Or if the raw flesh turns again, and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest. 
LEV.13.17	The priest shall examine him. Behold, if the plague has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean of the plague. He is clean.
LEV.13.18	“When the body has a boil on its skin, and it has healed, 
LEV.13.19	and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be shown to the priest. 
LEV.13.20	The priest shall examine it. Behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and its hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy. It has broken out in the boil. 
LEV.13.21	But if the priest examines it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it, and it isn’t deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall isolate him seven days. 
LEV.13.22	If it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a plague. 
LEV.13.23	But if the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn’t spread, it is the scar from the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
LEV.13.24	“Or when the body has a burn from fire on its skin, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white, 
LEV.13.25	then the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and its appearance is deeper than the skin, it is leprosy. It has broken out in the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy. 
LEV.13.26	But if the priest examines it, and behold, there is no white hair in the bright spot, and it isn’t deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall isolate him seven days. 
LEV.13.27	The priest shall examine him on the seventh day. If it has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy. 
LEV.13.28	If the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn’t spread in the skin, but is faded, it is the swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar from the burn.
LEV.13.29	“When a man or woman has a plague on the head or on the beard, 
LEV.13.30	then the priest shall examine the plague; and behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is an itch. It is leprosy of the head or of the beard. 
LEV.13.31	If the priest examines the plague of itching, and behold, its appearance isn’t deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate the person infected with itching seven days. 
LEV.13.32	On the seventh day the priest shall examine the plague; and behold, if the itch hasn’t spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the appearance of the itch isn’t deeper than the skin, 
LEV.13.33	then he shall be shaved, but he shall not shave the itch. Then the priest shall isolate the one who has the itch seven more days. 
LEV.13.34	On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the itch; and behold, if the itch hasn’t spread in the skin, and its appearance isn’t deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean. 
LEV.13.35	But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing, 
LEV.13.36	then the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest shall not look for the yellow hair; he is unclean. 
LEV.13.37	But if in his eyes the itch is arrested and black hair has grown in it, then the itch is healed. He is clean. The priest shall pronounce him clean.
LEV.13.38	“When a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of the body, even white bright spots, 
LEV.13.39	then the priest shall examine them. Behold, if the bright spots on the skin of their body are a dull white, it is a harmless rash. It has broken out in the skin. He is clean.
LEV.13.40	“If a man’s hair has fallen from his head, he is bald. He is clean. 
LEV.13.41	If his hair has fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald. He is clean. 
LEV.13.42	But if a reddish-white plague is in the bald head or the bald forehead, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head or his bald forehead. 
LEV.13.43	Then the priest shall examine him. Behold, if the swelling of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body, 
LEV.13.44	he is a leprous man. He is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean. His plague is on his head.
LEV.13.45	“The leper in whom the plague is shall wear torn clothes, and the hair of his head shall hang loose. He shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’ 
LEV.13.46	All the days in which the plague is in him he shall be unclean. He is unclean. He shall dwell alone. His dwelling shall be outside of the camp.
LEV.13.47	“The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it is a woollen garment, or a linen garment; 
LEV.13.48	whether it is in warp or woof;
LEV.13.49	if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the leather, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything made of leather; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be shown to the priest. 
LEV.13.50	The priest shall examine the plague, and isolate the plague seven days. 
LEV.13.51	He shall examine the plague on the seventh day. If the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever use the skin is used for, the plague is a destructive mildew. It is unclean. 
LEV.13.52	He shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of leather, in which the plague is, for it is a destructive mildew. It shall be burnt in the fire.
LEV.13.53	“If the priest examines it, and behold, the plague hasn’t spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; 
LEV.13.54	then the priest shall command that they wash the thing that the plague is in, and he shall isolate it seven more days. 
LEV.13.55	Then the priest shall examine it, after the plague is washed; and behold, if the plague hasn’t changed its colour, and the plague hasn’t spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire. It is a mildewed spot, whether the bareness is inside or outside. 
LEV.13.56	If the priest looks, and behold, the plague has faded after it is washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof; 
LEV.13.57	and if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading. You shall burn what the plague is in with fire. 
LEV.13.58	The garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing of skin it is, which you shall wash, if the plague has departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and it will be clean.”
LEV.13.59	This is the law of the plague of mildew in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or in anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
LEV.14.1	The 
LEV.14.2	“This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest, 
LEV.14.3	and the priest shall go out of the camp. The priest shall examine him. Behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper, 
LEV.14.4	then the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed two living clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop. 
LEV.14.5	The priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water. 
LEV.14.6	As for the living bird, he shall take it, the cedar wood, the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. 
LEV.14.7	He shall sprinkle on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird go into the open field.
LEV.14.8	“He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean. After that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days. 
LEV.14.9	It shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows. He shall shave off all his hair. He shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his body in water. Then he shall be clean.

LEV.14.13	He shall kill the male lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for as the sin offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass offering. It is most holy. 
LEV.14.14	The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

LEV.14.18	The rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, and the priest shall make atonement for him before the 
LEV.14.19	“The priest shall offer the sin offering, and make atonement for him who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness. Afterward he shall kill the burnt offering; 
LEV.14.20	then the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meal offering on the altar. The priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
LEV.14.21	“If he is poor, and can’t afford so much, then he shall take one male lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth of an ephah

LEV.14.36	The priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goes in to examine the plague, that all that is in the house not be made unclean. Afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house. 
LEV.14.37	He shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall, 
LEV.14.38	then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days. 
LEV.14.39	The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls of the house, 
LEV.14.40	then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city. 
LEV.14.41	He shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over. They shall pour out the mortar that they scraped off outside of the city into an unclean place. 
LEV.14.42	They shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.

LEV.25.52	If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption. 
LEV.25.53	As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him. He shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight. 
LEV.25.54	If he isn’t redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee: he and his children with him.

NUM.7.89	When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with the 
NUM.8.1	The 
NUM.8.2	“Speak to Aaron, and tell him, ‘When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lamp stand.’”
NUM.8.3	Aaron did so. He lit its lamps to light the area in front of the lamp stand, as the 
NUM.8.4	This was the workmanship of the lamp stand, beaten work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work. He made the lamp stand according to the pattern which the 
NUM.8.5	The 
NUM.8.6	“Take the Levites from amongst the children of Israel, and cleanse them. 
NUM.8.7	You shall do this to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves. 
NUM.8.8	Then let them take a young bull and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering. 
NUM.8.9	You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel. 
NUM.8.10	You shall present the Levites before the 
NUM.8.11	and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the 
NUM.8.12	“The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the 
NUM.8.13	You shall set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to the 
NUM.8.14	Thus you shall separate the Levites from amongst the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.
NUM.8.15	“After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting. You shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering. 
NUM.8.16	For they are wholly given to me from amongst the children of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel, I have taken them to me. 
NUM.8.17	For all the firstborn amongst the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself. 
NUM.8.18	I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn amongst the children of Israel. 
NUM.8.19	I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from amongst the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, so that there will be no plague amongst the children of Israel when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary.”
NUM.8.20	Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites. According to all that the 
NUM.8.21	The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before the 
NUM.8.22	After that, the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron and before his sons: as the 
NUM.8.23	The 
NUM.8.24	“This is what is assigned to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting; 
NUM.8.25	and from the age of fifty years they shall retire from doing the work, and shall serve no more, 
NUM.8.26	but shall assist their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall perform no service. This is how you shall have the Levites do their duties.”
NUM.9.1	The 
NUM.9.2	“Let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season. 
NUM.9.3	On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed season. You shall keep it according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances.”
NUM.9.4	Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover. 
NUM.9.5	They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that the 
NUM.9.6	There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day. 
NUM.9.7	Those men said to him, “We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of the 
NUM.9.8	Moses answered them, “Wait, that I may hear what the 
NUM.9.9	The 
NUM.9.10	“Say to the children of Israel, ‘If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to the 
NUM.9.11	In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
NUM.9.12	They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it. 
NUM.9.13	But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Because he didn’t offer the offering of the

NUM.9.16	So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. 
NUM.9.17	Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel travelled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped. 
NUM.9.18	At the commandment of the 
NUM.9.19	When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the 
NUM.9.20	Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of the 
NUM.9.21	Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they travelled; or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they travelled. 
NUM.9.22	Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Israel remained encamped, and didn’t travel; but when it was taken up, they travelled. 
NUM.9.23	At the commandment of the 
NUM.10.1	The 
NUM.10.2	“Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps. 
NUM.10.3	When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.10.4	If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you. 
NUM.10.5	When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward. 
NUM.10.6	When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys. 
NUM.10.7	But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
NUM.10.8	“The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations. 
NUM.10.9	When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before the 
NUM.10.10	“Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am the

NUM.10.12	The children of Israel went forward on their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran. 
NUM.10.13	They first went forward according to the commandment of the 
NUM.10.14	First, the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies. Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army. 
NUM.10.15	Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar. 
NUM.10.16	Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun. 
NUM.10.17	The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward. 
NUM.10.18	The standard of the camp of Reuben went forward according to their armies. Elizur the son of Shedeur was over his army. 
NUM.10.19	Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon. 
NUM.10.20	Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad.
NUM.10.21	The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary. The others set up the tabernacle before they arrived.
NUM.10.22	The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies. Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army. 
NUM.10.23	Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh. 
NUM.10.24	Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin.
NUM.10.25	The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their armies. Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army. 
NUM.10.26	Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher. 
NUM.10.27	Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali. 
NUM.10.28	Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies; and they went forward.
NUM.10.29	Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are journeying to the place of which the 
NUM.10.30	He said to him, “I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives.”
NUM.10.31	Moses said, “Don’t leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes. 
NUM.10.32	It shall be, if you go with us—yes, it shall be—that whatever good the

NUM.11.3	The name of that place was called Taberah,
NUM.11.4	The mixed multitude that was amongst them lusted exceedingly; and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, “Who will give us meat to eat? 
NUM.11.5	We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; 
NUM.11.6	but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at.” 
NUM.11.7	The manna was like coriander seed, and it looked like bdellium.
NUM.11.8	The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil. 
NUM.11.9	When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.
NUM.11.10	Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and the 
NUM.11.11	Moses said to the 
NUM.11.12	Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?’ 
NUM.11.13	Where could I get meat to give all these people? For they weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’ 
NUM.11.14	I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. 
NUM.11.15	If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favour in your sight; and don’t let me see my wretchedness.”
NUM.11.16	The 
NUM.11.17	I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you don’t bear it yourself alone.
NUM.11.18	“Say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of the 
NUM.11.19	You will not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, 
NUM.11.20	but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because you have rejected the 
NUM.11.21	Moses said, “The people, amongst whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month.’ 
NUM.11.22	Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?”
NUM.11.23	The 
NUM.11.24	Moses went out, and told the people the 
NUM.11.25	The 
NUM.11.26	But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the Spirit rested on them. They were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. 
NUM.11.27	A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”
NUM.11.28	Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, “My lord Moses, forbid them!”
NUM.11.29	Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the 
NUM.11.30	Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. 
NUM.11.31	A wind from the 
NUM.11.32	The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers;
NUM.11.33	While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the 
NUM.11.34	The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah,
NUM.11.35	From Kibroth Hattaavah the people travelled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth.
NUM.12.1	Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman. 
NUM.12.2	They said, “Has the

NUM.12.4	The 
NUM.12.4	The three of them came out. 
NUM.12.5	The 
NUM.12.6	He said, “Now hear my words. If there is a prophet amongst you, I, the 
NUM.12.7	My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house. 
NUM.12.8	With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see the 
NUM.12.9	The 
NUM.12.10	The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
NUM.12.11	Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, please don’t count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned. 
NUM.12.12	Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”
NUM.12.13	Moses cried to the 
NUM.12.14	The 
NUM.12.15	Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn’t travel until Miriam was brought in again. 
NUM.12.16	Afterward the people travelled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM.13.1	The 
NUM.13.2	“Send men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel. Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince amongst them.”
NUM.13.3	Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of the 
NUM.13.4	These were their names:
NUM.13.4	Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
NUM.13.5	Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
NUM.13.6	Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
NUM.13.7	Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
NUM.13.8	Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.
NUM.13.9	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
NUM.13.10	Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
NUM.13.11	Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
NUM.13.12	Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
NUM.13.13	Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
NUM.13.14	Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
NUM.13.15	Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua. 
NUM.13.17	Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country. 
NUM.13.18	See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; 
NUM.13.19	and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; 
NUM.13.20	and what the land is, whether it is fertile or poor, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.
NUM.13.21	So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath. 
NUM.13.22	They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
NUM.13.23	They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs. 
NUM.13.24	That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there. 
NUM.13.25	They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days. 
NUM.13.26	They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the land. 
NUM.13.27	They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us. Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. 
NUM.13.28	However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there. 
NUM.13.29	Amalek dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.”
NUM.13.30	Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let’s go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!”
NUM.13.31	But the men who went up with him said, “We aren’t able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.” 
NUM.13.32	They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature. 
NUM.13.33	There we saw the Nephilim,
NUM.14.1	All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. 
NUM.14.2	All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, “We wish that we had died in the land of Egypt, or that we had died in this wilderness! 
NUM.14.3	Why does the 
NUM.14.4	They said to one another, “Let’s choose a leader, and let’s return into Egypt.”
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
NUM.14.6	Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes. 
NUM.14.7	They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land. 
NUM.14.8	If the 
NUM.14.9	Only don’t rebel against the 
NUM.14.10	But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones.
NUM.14.10	The 
NUM.14.11	The 
NUM.14.12	I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”
NUM.14.13	Moses said to the 
NUM.14.14	They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you 
NUM.14.15	Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying, 
NUM.14.16	‘Because the

NUM.14.39	Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly. 
NUM.14.40	They rose up early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, “Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which the

NUM.16.3	They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, “You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and the

NUM.16.13	Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us? 
NUM.16.14	Moreover you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We won’t come up.”
NUM.16.15	Moses was very angry, and said to the 
NUM.16.16	Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company go before the

NUM.16.23	The 
NUM.16.24	“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!’”
NUM.16.25	Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 
NUM.16.26	He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!”
NUM.16.27	So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.

NUM.16.49	Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, in addition to those who died about the matter of Korah.

NUM.17.6	Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, a total of twelve rods. Aaron’s rod was amongst their rods. 
NUM.17.7	Moses laid up the rods before the

NUM.20.11	Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice, and water came out abundantly. The congregation and their livestock drank.
NUM.20.12	The 
NUM.20.13	These are the waters of Meribah;

NUM.20.16	When we cried to the 
NUM.20.17	“Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink from the water of the wells. We will go along the king’s highway. We will not turn away to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border.”
NUM.20.18	Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you.”
NUM.20.19	The children of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway; and if we drink your water, I and my livestock, then I will give its price. Only let me, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.”
NUM.20.20	He said, “You shall not pass through.” Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand. 
NUM.20.21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him.
NUM.20.22	They travelled from Kadesh, and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.

NUM.21.13	From there they travelled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	Therefore it is said in 
NUM.21.15	the slope of the valleys that incline towards the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab.”

NUM.21.18	which the nobles of the people dug,
NUM.21.18	with the sceptre, and with their poles.”
NUM.21.18	From the wilderness they travelled to Mattanah; 
NUM.21.19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; 
NUM.21.20	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert. 
NUM.21.21	Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
NUM.21.22	“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn away into field or vineyard. We will not drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed your border.”
NUM.21.23	Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel. 
NUM.21.24	Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was fortified. 
NUM.21.25	Israel took all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages. 
NUM.21.26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon. 
NUM.21.27	Therefore those who speak in proverbs say,
NUM.21.27	“Come to Heshbon.
NUM.21.27	Let the city of Sihon be built and established;
NUM.21.28	for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,
NUM.21.28	a flame from the city of Sihon.
NUM.21.28	It has devoured Ar of Moab,
NUM.21.28	The lords of the high places of the Arnon.
NUM.21.29	Woe to you, Moab!
NUM.21.29	You are undone, people of Chemosh!
NUM.21.29	He has given his sons as fugitives,
NUM.21.29	and his daughters into captivity,
NUM.21.29	to Sihon king of the Amorites.
NUM.21.30	We have shot at them.
NUM.21.30	Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.
NUM.21.30	We have laid waste even to Nophah,
NUM.21.30	Which reaches to Medeba.”
NUM.21.31	Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. 
NUM.21.32	Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its villages, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
NUM.21.33	They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
NUM.21.34	The 
NUM.21.35	So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were no survivors; and they possessed his land.
NUM.22.1	The children of Israel travelled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. 
NUM.22.2	Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
NUM.22.3	Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many. Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 
NUM.22.4	Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.”
NUM.22.4	Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 
NUM.22.5	He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me. 
NUM.22.6	Please come now therefore, and curse this people for me; for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”
NUM.22.7	The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand. They came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.
NUM.22.8	He said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the 
NUM.22.9	God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?”
NUM.22.10	Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me, 
NUM.22.11	‘Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt covers the surface of the earth. Now, come curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.’”
NUM.22.12	God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”
NUM.22.13	Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land; for the 
NUM.22.14	The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”
NUM.22.15	Balak again sent princes, more, and more honourable than they. 
NUM.22.16	They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Balak the son of Zippor says, ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me, 
NUM.22.17	for I will promote you to very great honour, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.’”
NUM.22.18	Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the word of the 
NUM.22.19	Now therefore please stay here tonight as well, that I may know what else the 
NUM.22.20	God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.”
NUM.22.21	Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab. 
NUM.22.22	God’s anger burnt because he went; and the 
NUM.22.23	The donkey saw the 
NUM.22.24	Then the 
NUM.22.25	The donkey saw the 
NUM.22.26	The 
NUM.22.27	The donkey saw the 
NUM.22.28	The 
NUM.22.29	Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.”
NUM.22.30	The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long until today? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?”
NUM.22.30	He said, “No.”
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	The 
NUM.22.33	The donkey saw me, and turned away before me these three times. Unless she had turned away from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive.”
NUM.22.34	Balaam said to the 
NUM.22.35	The 
NUM.22.35	So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
NUM.22.36	When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. 
NUM.22.37	Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I earnestly send for you to summon you? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honour?”
NUM.22.38	Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? I will speak the word that God puts in my mouth.”
NUM.22.39	Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him. 
NUM.22.41	In the morning, Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there part of the people.
NUM.23.1	Balaam said to Balak, “Build here seven altars for me, and prepare here seven bulls and seven rams for me.”
NUM.23.2	Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram. 
NUM.23.3	Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the 
NUM.23.3	He went to a bare height. 
NUM.23.4	God met Balaam, and he said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.”
NUM.23.5	The 
NUM.23.6	He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab. 
NUM.23.7	He took up his parable, and said,
NUM.23.7	“From Aram has Balak brought me,
NUM.23.7	the king of Moab from the mountains of the East.
NUM.23.7	Come, curse Jacob for me.
NUM.23.7	Come, defy Israel.
NUM.23.8	How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?
NUM.23.8	How shall I defy whom the 
NUM.23.9	For from the top of the rocks I see him.
NUM.23.9	From the hills I see him.
NUM.23.9	Behold, it is a people that dwells alone,
NUM.23.9	and shall not be listed amongst the nations.
NUM.23.10	Who can count the dust of Jacob,
NUM.23.10	or count the fourth part of Israel?
NUM.23.10	Let me die the death of the righteous!
NUM.23.10	Let my last end be like his!”
NUM.23.11	Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether.”
NUM.23.12	He answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which the 
NUM.23.13	Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, where you may see them. You shall see just part of them, and shall not see them all. Curse them from there for me.”
NUM.23.14	He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar. 
NUM.23.15	He said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet God over there.”
NUM.23.16	The 
NUM.23.17	He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, “What has the 
NUM.23.18	He took up his parable, and said,
NUM.23.18	“Rise up, Balak, and hear!
NUM.23.18	Listen to me, you son of Zippor.
NUM.23.19	God is not a man, that he should lie,
NUM.23.19	nor a son of man, that he should repent.
NUM.23.19	Has he said, and he won’t do it?
NUM.23.19	Or has he spoken, and he won’t make it good?
NUM.23.20	Behold, I have received a command to bless.
NUM.23.20	He has blessed, and I can’t reverse it.
NUM.23.21	He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.
NUM.23.21	Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel.
NUM.23.21	The 
NUM.23.21	The shout of a king is amongst them.
NUM.23.22	God brings them out of Egypt.
NUM.23.22	He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.
NUM.23.23	Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob;
NUM.23.23	Neither is there any divination with Israel.
NUM.23.23	Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,
NUM.23.23	‘What has God done!’
NUM.23.24	Behold, a people rises up as a lioness.
NUM.23.24	As a lion he lifts himself up.
NUM.23.24	He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey,
NUM.23.24	and drinks the blood of the slain.”
NUM.23.25	Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.”
NUM.23.26	But Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘All that the 
NUM.23.27	Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”
NUM.23.28	Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert. 
NUM.23.29	Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”
NUM.23.30	Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
NUM.24.1	When Balaam saw that it pleased the 
NUM.24.2	Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him. 
NUM.24.3	He took up his parable, and said,
NUM.24.3	“Balaam the son of Beor says,
NUM.24.3	the man whose eyes are open says;
NUM.24.4	he says, who hears the words of God,
NUM.24.4	who sees the vision of the Almighty,
NUM.24.4	falling down, and having his eyes open:
NUM.24.5	How goodly are your tents, Jacob,
NUM.24.5	and your dwellings, Israel!
NUM.24.6	As valleys they are spread out,
NUM.24.6	as gardens by the riverside,
NUM.24.6	as aloes which the 
NUM.24.6	as cedar trees beside the waters.
NUM.24.7	Water shall flow from his buckets.
NUM.24.7	His seed shall be in many waters.
NUM.24.7	His king shall be higher than Agag.
NUM.24.7	His kingdom shall be exalted.
NUM.24.8	God brings him out of Egypt.
NUM.24.8	He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.
NUM.24.8	He shall consume the nations his adversaries,
NUM.24.8	shall break their bones in pieces,
NUM.24.8	and pierce them with his arrows.
NUM.24.9	He couched, he lay down as a lion,
NUM.24.9	as a lioness;
NUM.24.9	who shall rouse him up?
NUM.24.9	Everyone who blesses you is blessed.
NUM.24.9	Everyone who curses you is cursed.”
NUM.24.10	Balak’s anger burnt against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times. 
NUM.24.11	Therefore, flee to your place, now! I thought to promote you to great honour; but, behold, the 
NUM.24.12	Balaam said to Balak, “Didn’t I also tell your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, 
NUM.24.13	‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the 
NUM.24.14	Now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.”
NUM.24.15	He took up his parable, and said,
NUM.24.15	“Balaam the son of Beor says,
NUM.24.15	the man whose eyes are open says;
NUM.24.16	he says, who hears the words of God,
NUM.24.16	knows the knowledge of the Most High,
NUM.24.16	and who sees the vision of the Almighty,
NUM.24.16	falling down, and having his eyes open:
NUM.24.17	I see him, but not now.
NUM.24.17	I see him, but not near.
NUM.24.17	A star will come out of Jacob.
NUM.24.17	A sceptre will rise out of Israel,
NUM.24.17	and shall strike through the corners of Moab,
NUM.24.17	and crush all the sons of Sheth.
NUM.24.18	Edom shall be a possession.
NUM.24.18	Seir, his enemy, also shall be a possession,
NUM.24.18	while Israel does valiantly.
NUM.24.19	Out of Jacob shall one have dominion,
NUM.24.19	and shall destroy the remnant from the city.”
NUM.24.20	He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,
NUM.24.20	“Amalek was the first of the nations,
NUM.24.20	But his latter end shall come to destruction.”
NUM.24.21	He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,
NUM.24.21	“Your dwelling place is strong.
NUM.24.21	Your nest is set in the rock.
NUM.24.22	Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,
NUM.24.22	until Asshur carries you away captive.”
NUM.24.23	He took up his parable, and said,
NUM.24.23	“Alas, who shall live when God does this?
NUM.24.24	But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim.
NUM.24.24	They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.
NUM.24.24	He also shall come to destruction.”
NUM.24.25	Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
NUM.25.1	Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab; 
NUM.25.2	for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods. The people ate and bowed down to their gods. 
NUM.25.3	Israel joined himself to Baal Peor, and the 
NUM.25.4	The 
NUM.25.5	Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.”
NUM.25.6	Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
NUM.25.7	When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the middle of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand. 
NUM.25.8	He went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stopped amongst the children of Israel. 
NUM.25.9	Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
NUM.25.10	The 
NUM.25.11	“Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy amongst them, so that I didn’t consume the children of Israel in my jealousy. 
NUM.25.12	Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace. 
NUM.25.13	It shall be to him, and to his offspring after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.’”
NUM.25.14	Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house amongst the Simeonites. 
NUM.25.15	The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian.
NUM.25.16	The 
NUM.25.17	“Harass the Midianites, and strike them; 
NUM.25.18	for they harassed you with their wiles, wherein they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the incident regarding Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.”
NUM.26.1	After the plague, the 
NUM.26.2	“Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ houses, all who are able to go out to war in Israel.” 
NUM.26.3	Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, 
NUM.26.4	“Take a census, from twenty years old and upward, as the 
NUM.26.4	These are those who came out of the land of Egypt. 
NUM.26.5	Reuben, the firstborn of Israel; the sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;

NUM.26.8	The son of Pallu: Eliab. 
NUM.26.9	The sons of Eliab: Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are that Dathan and Abiram who were called by the congregation, who rebelled against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah when they rebelled against the 
NUM.26.10	and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah when that company died; at the time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, and they became a sign.

NUM.32.7	Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the 
NUM.32.8	Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. 
NUM.32.9	For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the

NUM.32.13	The 
NUM.32.14	“Behold, you have risen up in your fathers’ place, an increase of sinful men, to increase the fierce anger of the 
NUM.32.15	For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all these people.”
NUM.32.16	They came near to him, and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones; 
NUM.32.17	but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. Our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 
NUM.32.18	We will not return to our houses until the children of Israel have all received their inheritance. 
NUM.32.19	For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.”

NUM.32.21	and every one of your armed men will pass over the Jordan before the 
NUM.32.22	and the land is subdued before the 
NUM.32.23	“But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the 
NUM.32.24	Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.”
NUM.32.25	The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do as my lord commands. 
NUM.32.26	Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock shall be there in the cities of Gilead; 
NUM.32.27	but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before the 
NUM.32.28	So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the children of Israel. 
NUM.32.29	Moses said to them, “If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle before the 
NUM.32.30	but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions amongst you in the land of Canaan.”
NUM.32.31	The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, “As the 
NUM.32.32	We will pass over armed before the 
NUM.32.33	Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan; the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land.

NUM.32.37	The children of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
NUM.32.38	Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah. They gave other names to the cities which they built. 
NUM.32.39	The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein.

NUM.36.13	These are the commandments and the ordinances which the 
DEU.1.1	These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suf, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
DEU.1.2	It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea. 
DEU.1.3	In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the 
DEU.1.4	after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. 
DEU.1.5	Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying, 
DEU.1.6	“The 
DEU.1.7	Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the places near there: in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the South, by the seashore, in the land of the Canaanites, and in Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. 
DEU.1.8	Behold,
DEU.1.9	I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone. 
DEU.1.10	The 
DEU.1.11	The 
DEU.1.12	How can I myself alone bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife? 
DEU.1.13	Take wise men of understanding who are respected amongst your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.”
DEU.1.14	You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.” 
DEU.1.15	So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. 
DEU.1.16	I commanded your judges at that time, saying, “Hear cases between your brothers and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him. 
DEU.1.17	You shall not show partiality in judgement; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgement is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.” 
DEU.1.18	I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do. 
DEU.1.19	We travelled from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the 
DEU.1.20	I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the 
DEU.1.21	Behold, the 
DEU.1.22	You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let’s send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.”
DEU.1.23	The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of your men, one man for every tribe. 
DEU.1.24	They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. 
DEU.1.25	They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which the 
DEU.1.26	Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the 
DEU.1.27	You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because the 
DEU.1.28	Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’”
DEU.1.29	Then I said to you, “Don’t be terrified. Don’t be afraid of them. 
DEU.1.30	The 
DEU.1.31	and in the wilderness where you have seen how that the 
DEU.1.32	Yet in this thing you didn’t believe the 
DEU.1.33	who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day. 
DEU.1.34	The 
DEU.1.35	“Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers, 
DEU.1.36	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on to him and to his children, because he has wholly followed the 
DEU.1.37	Also the 
DEU.1.38	Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
DEU.1.39	Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give it to them, and they shall possess it. 
DEU.1.40	But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”
DEU.1.41	Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against the 
DEU.1.42	The 
DEU.1.43	So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of the 
DEU.1.44	The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah. 
DEU.1.45	You returned and wept before the 
DEU.1.46	So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.
DEU.2.1	Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as the 
DEU.2.2	The 
DEU.2.3	“You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward. 
DEU.2.4	Command the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be careful. 
DEU.2.5	Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession. 
DEU.2.6	You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.’”
DEU.2.7	For the 
DEU.2.8	So we passed by from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
DEU.2.9	The 
DEU.2.10	(The Emim lived there before, a great and numerous people, and tall as the Anakim. 
DEU.2.11	These also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 
DEU.2.12	The Horites also lived in Seir in the past, but the children of Esau succeeded them. They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the 
DEU.2.13	“Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered.
DEU.2.14	The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the brook Zered were thirty-eight years: until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as the 
DEU.2.15	Moreover the 
DEU.2.16	So, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from amongst the people, 
DEU.2.17	the 
DEU.2.18	“You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab, today. 
DEU.2.19	When you come near the border of the children of Ammon, don’t bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.”
DEU.2.20	(That also is considered a land of Rephaim. Rephaim lived there in the past, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, 
DEU.2.21	a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but the 
DEU.2.22	as he did for the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day. 
DEU.2.23	Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.)
DEU.2.24	“Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 
DEU.2.25	Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.”
DEU.2.26	I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
DEU.2.27	“Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway. I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left. 
DEU.2.28	You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet, 
DEU.2.29	as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I pass over the Jordan into the land which the 
DEU.2.30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the 
DEU.2.31	The 
DEU.2.32	Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. 
DEU.2.33	The 
DEU.2.34	We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining. 
DEU.2.35	Only the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities which we had taken. 
DEU.2.36	From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. The 
DEU.2.37	Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near: all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the 
DEU.3.1	Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
DEU.3.2	The 
DEU.3.3	So the 
DEU.3.4	We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.5	All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great many villages without walls. 
DEU.3.6	We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. 
DEU.3.7	But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves. 
DEU.3.8	We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon. 
DEU.3.9	(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.) 
DEU.3.10	We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits
DEU.3.12	This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites; 
DEU.3.13	and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh—all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim. 
DEU.3.14	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.) 
DEU.3.15	I gave Gilead to Machir. 
DEU.3.16	To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 
DEU.3.17	the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
DEU.3.18	I commanded you at that time, saying, “The 
DEU.3.19	But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you, 
DEU.3.20	until the 
DEU.3.21	I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that the 
DEU.3.22	You shall not fear them; for the 
DEU.3.23	I begged GOD at that time, saying, 
DEU.3.24	“Lord
DEU.3.25	Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.”
DEU.3.26	But the 
DEU.3.27	Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan. 
DEU.3.28	But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.” 
DEU.3.29	So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
DEU.4.1	Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.4.2	You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the 
DEU.4.3	Your eyes have seen what the 
DEU.4.4	But you who were faithful to the 
DEU.4.5	Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as the 
DEU.4.6	Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who shall hear all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.” 
DEU.4.7	For what great nation is there that has a god so near to them as the 
DEU.4.8	What great nation is there that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law which I set before you today?
DEU.4.9	Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children— 
DEU.4.10	the day that you stood before the 
DEU.4.11	You came near and stood under the mountain. The mountain burnt with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 
DEU.4.12	The 
DEU.4.13	He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets. 
DEU.4.14	The 
DEU.4.15	Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that the 
DEU.4.16	lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
DEU.4.17	the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky, 
DEU.4.18	the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth; 
DEU.4.19	and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which the 
DEU.4.20	But the 
DEU.4.21	Furthermore the 
DEU.4.22	but I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan, but you shall go over and possess that good land. 
DEU.4.23	Be careful, lest you forget the covenant of the 
DEU.4.24	For the 
DEU.4.25	When you father children and children’s children, and you have been long in the land, and then corrupt yourselves, and make a carved image in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in the 
DEU.4.26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan to possess it. You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed. 
DEU.4.27	The 
DEU.4.28	There you will serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
DEU.4.29	But from there you shall seek the 
DEU.4.30	When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to the 
DEU.4.31	For the 
DEU.4.32	For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as great as this thing is, or has been heard like it? 
DEU.4.33	Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live? 
DEU.4.34	Or has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from amongst another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the 
DEU.4.35	It was shown to you so that you might know that the 
DEU.4.36	Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire. 
DEU.4.37	Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; 
DEU.4.38	to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today. 
DEU.4.39	Know therefore today, and take it to heart, that the 
DEU.4.40	You shall keep his statutes and his commandments which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which the 
DEU.4.41	Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan towards the sunrise, 
DEU.4.42	that the man slayer might flee there, who kills his neighbour unintentionally and didn’t hate him in time past, and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live: 
DEU.4.43	Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
DEU.4.44	This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel. 
DEU.4.45	These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt, 
DEU.4.46	beyond the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck when they came out of Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan towards the sunrise; 
DEU.4.48	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (also called Hermon), 
DEU.4.49	and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, “Hear, Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears today, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.” 
DEU.5.2	The 
DEU.5.3	The 
DEU.5.4	The 
DEU.5.5	(I stood between the 
DEU.5.6	“I am the 
DEU.5.7	“You shall have no other gods before me.
DEU.5.8	“You shall not make a carved image for yourself—any likeness of what is in heaven above, or what is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 
DEU.5.9	You shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them; for I, the 
DEU.5.10	and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
DEU.5.11	“You shall not misuse the name of the 
DEU.5.12	“Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the 
DEU.5.13	You shall labour six days, and do all your work; 
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the 
DEU.5.15	You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the 
DEU.5.16	“Honour your father and your mother, as the 
DEU.5.17	“You shall not murder.
DEU.5.18	“You shall not commit adultery.
DEU.5.19	“You shall not steal.
DEU.5.20	“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbour.
DEU.5.21	“You shall not covet your neighbour’s wife. Neither shall you desire your neighbour’s house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbour’s.”
DEU.5.22	The 
DEU.5.23	When you heard the voice out of the middle of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 
DEU.5.24	and you said, “Behold, the 
DEU.5.25	Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the 
DEU.5.26	For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as we have, and lived? 
DEU.5.27	Go near, and hear all that the 
DEU.5.28	The 
DEU.5.29	Oh that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them and with their children forever!
DEU.5.30	“Go tell them, ‘Return to your tents.’ 
DEU.5.31	But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess.”
DEU.5.32	You shall observe to do therefore as the 
DEU.5.33	You shall walk in all the way which the 
DEU.6.1	Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances, which the 
DEU.6.2	that you might fear the 
DEU.6.3	Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it, that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as the 
DEU.6.4	Hear, Israel: the 
DEU.6.5	You shall love the 
DEU.6.6	These words, which I command you today, shall be on your heart; 
DEU.6.7	and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
DEU.6.8	You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. 
DEU.6.9	You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates.
DEU.6.10	It shall be, when the 
DEU.6.11	and houses full of all good things which you didn’t fill, and cisterns dug out which you didn’t dig, vineyards and olive trees which you didn’t plant, and you shall eat and be full; 
DEU.6.12	then beware lest you forget the 
DEU.6.13	You shall fear the 
DEU.6.14	You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around you, 
DEU.6.15	for the 
DEU.6.16	You shall not tempt the 
DEU.6.17	You shall diligently keep the commandments of the 
DEU.6.18	You shall do that which is right and good in the 
DEU.6.19	to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as the 
DEU.6.20	When your son asks you in time to come, saying, “What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances, which the 
DEU.6.21	then you shall tell your son, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt. The 
DEU.6.22	and the 
DEU.6.23	and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers. 
DEU.6.24	The 
DEU.6.25	It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all these commandments before the 
DEU.7.1	When the 
DEU.7.2	and when the 
DEU.7.3	You shall not make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son. 
DEU.7.4	For that would turn away your sons from following me, that they may serve other gods. So the 
DEU.7.5	But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their engraved images with fire. 
DEU.7.6	For you are a holy people to the 
DEU.7.7	The 
DEU.7.8	but because the 
DEU.7.9	Know therefore that the 
DEU.7.10	and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face. 
DEU.7.11	You shall therefore keep the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances which I command you today, to do them. 
DEU.7.12	It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances and keep and do them, that the 
DEU.7.13	He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you. 
DEU.7.14	You will be blessed above all peoples. There won’t be male or female barren amongst you, or amongst your livestock. 
DEU.7.15	The 
DEU.7.16	You shall consume all the peoples whom the 
DEU.7.17	If you shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?” 
DEU.7.18	you shall not be afraid of them. You shall remember well what the 
DEU.7.19	the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the 
DEU.7.20	Moreover the 
DEU.7.21	You shall not be scared of them; for the 
DEU.7.22	The 
DEU.7.23	But the 
DEU.7.24	He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under the sky. No one will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them. 
DEU.7.25	You shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to the 
DEU.7.26	You shall not bring an abomination into your house and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it. You shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
DEU.8.1	You shall observe to do all the commandments which I command you today, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.8.2	You shall remember all the way which the 
DEU.8.3	He humbled you, allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna, which you didn’t know, neither did your fathers know, that he might teach you that man does not live by bread only, but man lives by every word that proceeds out of the 
DEU.8.4	Your clothing didn’t grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years. 
DEU.8.5	You shall consider in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the 
DEU.8.6	You shall keep the commandments of the 
DEU.8.7	For the 
DEU.8.8	a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey; 
DEU.8.9	a land in which you shall eat bread without scarcity, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper. 
DEU.8.10	You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless the 
DEU.8.11	Beware lest you forget the 
DEU.8.12	lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built fine houses and lived in them; 
DEU.8.13	and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; 
DEU.8.14	then your heart might be lifted up, and you forget the 
DEU.8.15	who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with venomous snakes and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who poured water for you out of the rock of flint; 
DEU.8.16	who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn’t know, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end; 
DEU.8.17	and lest you say in your heart, “My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.” 
DEU.8.18	But you shall remember the 
DEU.8.19	It shall be, if you shall forget the 
DEU.8.20	As the nations that the 
DEU.9.1	Hear, Israel! You are to pass over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky, 
DEU.9.2	a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?” 
DEU.9.3	Know therefore today that the 
DEU.9.4	Don’t say in your heart, after the 
DEU.9.5	Not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations the 
DEU.9.6	Know therefore that the 
DEU.9.7	Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked the 
DEU.9.8	Also in Horeb you provoked the 
DEU.9.9	When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant which the 
DEU.9.10	The 
DEU.9.11	It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that the 
DEU.9.12	The 
DEU.9.13	Furthermore the 
DEU.9.14	Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.”
DEU.9.15	So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. 
DEU.9.16	I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the 
DEU.9.17	I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. 
DEU.9.18	I fell down before the 
DEU.9.19	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the 
DEU.9.20	The 
DEU.9.21	I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain. 
DEU.9.22	At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked the 
DEU.9.23	When the 
DEU.9.24	You have been rebellious against the 
DEU.9.25	So I fell down before the 
DEU.9.26	I prayed to the 
DEU.9.27	Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin, 
DEU.9.28	lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because the 
DEU.9.29	Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.”
DEU.10.1	At that time the 
DEU.10.2	I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.” 
DEU.10.3	So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. 
DEU.10.4	He wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the 
DEU.10.5	I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are as the 
DEU.10.6	(The children of Israel travelled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his place. 
DEU.10.7	From there they travelled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. 
DEU.10.8	At that time the 
DEU.10.9	Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; the 
DEU.10.10	I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the 
DEU.10.11	The 
DEU.10.12	Now, Israel, what does the 
DEU.10.13	to keep the 
DEU.10.14	Behold, to the 
DEU.10.15	Only the 
DEU.10.16	Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked. 
DEU.10.17	For the 
DEU.10.18	He executes justice for the fatherless and widow and loves the foreigner in giving him food and clothing. 
DEU.10.19	Therefore love the foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	You shall fear the 
DEU.10.21	He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things which your eyes have seen. 
DEU.10.22	Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now the 
DEU.11.1	Therefore you shall love the 
DEU.11.2	Know this day—for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of the 
DEU.11.3	his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land; 
DEU.11.4	and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued you, and how the 
DEU.11.5	and what he did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place; 
DEU.11.6	and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben—how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the middle of all Israel; 
DEU.11.7	but your eyes have seen all of the 
DEU.11.8	Therefore you shall keep the entire commandment which I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land that you go over to possess; 
DEU.11.9	and that you may prolong your days in the land which the 
DEU.11.10	For the land, where you go in to possess isn’t like the land of Egypt that you came out of, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs; 
DEU.11.11	but the land that you go over to possess is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from the rain of the sky, 
DEU.11.12	a land which the 
DEU.11.13	It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you today, to love the 
DEU.11.14	that I will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil. 
DEU.11.15	I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full. 
DEU.11.16	Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn away to serve other gods and worship them; 
DEU.11.17	and the 
DEU.11.18	Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul. You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. 
DEU.11.19	You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. 
DEU.11.20	You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates; 
DEU.11.21	that your days and your children’s days may be multiplied in the land which the 
DEU.11.22	For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you—to do them, to love the 
DEU.11.23	then the 
DEU.11.24	Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the western sea shall be your border. 
DEU.11.25	No man will be able to stand before you. The 
DEU.11.26	Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse: 
DEU.11.27	the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of the 
DEU.11.28	and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of the 
DEU.11.29	It shall happen, when the 
DEU.11.30	Aren’t they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah near Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? 
DEU.11.31	For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the 
DEU.11.32	You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you today.
DEU.12.1	These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which the 
DEU.12.2	You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods: on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 
DEU.12.3	You shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, and burn their Asherah poles with fire. You shall cut down the engraved images of their gods. You shall destroy their name out of that place. 
DEU.12.4	You shall not do so to the 
DEU.12.5	But to the place which the 
DEU.12.6	You shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, your vows, your free will offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock there. 
DEU.12.7	There you shall eat before the 
DEU.12.8	You shall not do all the things that we do here today, every man whatever is right in his own eyes; 
DEU.12.9	for you haven’t yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the 
DEU.12.10	But when you go over the Jordan and dwell in the land which the 
DEU.12.11	then it shall happen that to the place which the 
DEU.12.12	You shall rejoice before the 
DEU.12.13	Be careful that you don’t offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see; 
DEU.12.14	but in the place which the 
DEU.12.15	Yet you may kill and eat meat within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to the 
DEU.12.16	Only you shall not eat the blood. You shall pour it out on the earth like water. 
DEU.12.17	You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your free will offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand; 
DEU.12.18	but you shall eat them before the 
DEU.12.19	Be careful that you don’t forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
DEU.12.20	When the 
DEU.12.21	If the place which the 
DEU.12.22	Even as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten, so you shall eat of it. The unclean and the clean may eat of it alike. 
DEU.12.23	Only be sure that you don’t eat the blood; for the blood is the life. You shall not eat the life with the meat. 
DEU.12.24	You shall not eat it. You shall pour it out on the earth like water. 
DEU.12.25	You shall not eat it, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, when you do that which is right in the 
DEU.12.26	Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take and go to the place which the 
DEU.12.27	You shall offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the blood, on the 
DEU.12.28	Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in the 
DEU.12.29	When the 
DEU.12.30	be careful that you are not ensnared to follow them after they are destroyed from before you, and that you not enquire after their gods, saying, “How do these nations serve their gods? I will do likewise.” 
DEU.12.31	You shall not do so to the 
DEU.12.32	Whatever thing I command you, that you shall observe to do. You shall not add to it, nor take away from it.
DEU.13.1	If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises amongst you, and he gives you a sign or a wonder, 
DEU.13.2	and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, “Let’s go after other gods” (which you have not known) “and let’s serve them,” 
DEU.13.3	you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams; for the 
DEU.13.4	You shall walk after the 
DEU.13.5	That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against the 
DEU.13.6	If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, entices you secretly, saying, “Let’s go and serve other gods”—which you have not known, you, nor your fathers; 
DEU.13.7	of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth— 
DEU.13.8	you shall not consent to him nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him; 
DEU.13.9	but you shall surely kill him. Your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hands of all the people. 
DEU.13.10	You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from the 
DEU.13.11	All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more wickedness like this amongst you.
DEU.13.12	If you hear about one of your cities, which the 
DEU.13.13	certain wicked fellows have gone out from amongst you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, “Let’s go and serve other gods,” which you have not known, 
DEU.13.14	then you shall enquire, investigate, and ask diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination was done amongst you, 
DEU.13.15	you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, with all that is therein and its livestock, with the edge of the sword. 
DEU.13.16	You shall gather all its plunder into the middle of its street, and shall burn with fire the city, with all of its plunder, to the 
DEU.13.17	Nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand, that the 
DEU.13.18	when you listen to the 
DEU.14.1	You are the children of the 
DEU.14.2	For you are a holy people to the 
DEU.14.3	You shall not eat any abominable thing. 
DEU.14.4	These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, 
DEU.14.5	the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the chamois. 
DEU.14.6	Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof split in two and chews the cud, amongst the animals, you may eat. 
DEU.14.7	Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who have the hoof split: the camel, the hare, and the rabbit. Because they chew the cud but don’t part the hoof, they are unclean to you. 
DEU.14.8	The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn’t chew the cud, is unclean to you. You shall not eat their meat. You shall not touch their carcasses. 
DEU.14.9	These you may eat of all that are in the waters: you may eat whatever has fins and scales. 
DEU.14.10	You shall not eat whatever doesn’t have fins and scales. It is unclean to you. 
DEU.14.11	Of all clean birds you may eat. 
DEU.14.12	But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey, 
DEU.14.13	the red kite, the falcon, the kite of any kind, 
DEU.14.14	every raven of any kind, 
DEU.14.15	the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, the hawk of any kind, 
DEU.14.16	the little owl, the great owl, the horned owl, 
DEU.14.17	the pelican, the vulture, the cormorant, 
DEU.14.18	the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat. 
DEU.14.19	All winged creeping things are unclean to you. They shall not be eaten. 
DEU.14.20	Of all clean birds you may eat.
DEU.14.21	You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself. You may give it to the foreigner living amongst you who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a holy people to the 
DEU.14.21	You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.
DEU.14.22	You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed, that which comes out of the field year by year. 
DEU.14.23	You shall eat before the 
DEU.14.24	If the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it because the place which the 
DEU.14.25	then you shall turn it into money, bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which the 
DEU.14.26	You shall trade the money for whatever your soul desires: for cattle, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you. You shall eat there before the 
DEU.14.27	You shall not forsake the Levite who is within your gates, for he has no portion nor inheritance with you. 
DEU.14.28	At the end of every three years you shall bring all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall store it within your gates. 
DEU.14.29	The Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, as well as the foreigner living amongst you, the fatherless, and the widow who are within your gates shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the 
DEU.15.1	At the end of every seven years, you shall cancel debts. 
DEU.15.2	This is the way it shall be done: every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbour. He shall not require payment from his neighbour and his brother, because the 
DEU.15.3	Of a foreigner you may require it; but whatever of yours is with your brother, your hand shall release. 
DEU.15.4	However there will be no poor with you (for the 
DEU.15.5	if only you diligently listen to the 
DEU.15.6	For the 
DEU.15.7	If a poor man, one of your brothers, is with you within any of your gates in your land which the 
DEU.15.8	but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need, which he lacks. 
DEU.15.9	Beware that there not be a wicked thought in your heart, saying, “The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand,” and your eye be evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing; and he cry to the 
DEU.15.10	You shall surely give, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him, because it is for this thing the 
DEU.15.11	For the poor will never cease out of the land. Therefore I command you to surely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land. 
DEU.15.12	If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and serves you six years, then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. 
DEU.15.13	When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty. 
DEU.15.14	You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your wine press. As the 
DEU.15.15	You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the 
DEU.15.16	It shall be, if he tells you, “I will not go out from you,” because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you, 
DEU.15.17	then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall do likewise. 
DEU.15.18	It shall not seem hard to you when you let him go free from you, for he has been double the value of a hired hand as he served you six years. The 
DEU.15.19	You shall dedicate all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock to the 
DEU.15.20	You shall eat it before the 
DEU.15.21	If it has any defect—is lame or blind, or has any defect whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to the 
DEU.15.22	You shall eat it within your gates. The unclean and the clean shall eat it alike, as the gazelle and as the deer. 
DEU.15.23	Only you shall not eat its blood. You shall pour it out on the ground like water.
DEU.16.1	Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to the 
DEU.16.2	You shall sacrifice the Passover to the 
DEU.16.3	You shall eat no leavened bread with it. You shall eat unleavened bread with it seven days, even the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste) that you may remember the day when you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life. 
DEU.16.4	No yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the meat, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning. 
DEU.16.5	You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates which the 
DEU.16.6	but at the place which the 
DEU.16.7	You shall roast and eat it in the place which the 
DEU.16.8	Six days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the 
DEU.16.9	You shall count for yourselves seven weeks. From the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to count seven weeks. 
DEU.16.10	You shall keep the feast of weeks to the 
DEU.16.11	You shall rejoice before the 
DEU.16.12	You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt. You shall observe and do these statutes.
DEU.16.13	You shall keep the feast of booths seven days, after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your wine press. 
DEU.16.14	You shall rejoice in your feast, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow who are within your gates. 
DEU.16.15	You shall keep a feast to the 
DEU.16.16	Three times in a year all of your males shall appear before the 
DEU.16.17	Every man shall give as he is able, according to the 
DEU.16.18	You shall make judges and officers in all your gates, which the 
DEU.16.19	You shall not pervert justice. You shall not show partiality. You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous. 
DEU.16.20	You shall follow that which is altogether just, that you may live and inherit the land which the 
DEU.16.21	You shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the 
DEU.16.22	Neither shall you set yourself up a sacred stone which the 
DEU.17.1	You shall not sacrifice to the 
DEU.17.2	If there is found amongst you, within any of your gates which the 
DEU.17.3	and has gone and served other gods and worshipped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the stars of the sky, which I have not commanded, 
DEU.17.4	and you are told, and you have heard of it, then you shall enquire diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Israel, 
DEU.17.5	then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil thing to your gates, even that same man or woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones. 
DEU.17.6	At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death. At the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death. 
DEU.17.7	The hands of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall remove the evil from amongst you.
DEU.17.8	If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgement, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise, and go up to the place which the 
DEU.17.9	You shall come to the priests who are Levites and to the judge who shall be in those days. You shall enquire, and they shall give you the verdict. 
DEU.17.10	You shall do according to the decisions of the verdict which they shall give you from that place which the 
DEU.17.11	According to the decisions of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgement which they shall tell you, you shall do. You shall not turn away from the sentence which they announce to you, to the right hand, nor to the left. 
DEU.17.12	The man who does presumptuously in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before the 
DEU.17.13	All the people shall hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
DEU.17.14	When you have come to the land which the 
DEU.17.15	you shall surely set him whom the 
DEU.17.16	Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; because the 
DEU.17.17	He shall not multiply wives to himself, that his heart not turn away. He shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
DEU.17.18	It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write himself a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the Levitical priests. 
DEU.17.19	It shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the 
DEU.17.20	that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not turn away from the commandment to the right hand, or to the left, to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the middle of Israel.
DEU.18.1	The priests and the Levites—all the tribe of Levi—shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel. They shall eat the offerings of the 
DEU.18.2	They shall have no inheritance amongst their brothers. The 
DEU.18.3	This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest: the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the inner parts. 
DEU.18.4	You shall give him the first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep. 
DEU.18.5	For the 
DEU.18.6	If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel where he lives, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which the 
DEU.18.7	then he shall minister in the name of the 
DEU.18.8	They shall have like portions to eat, in addition to that which comes from the sale of his family possessions.
DEU.18.9	When you have come into the land which the 
DEU.18.10	There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who tells fortunes, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, 
DEU.18.11	or a charmer, or someone who consults with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 
DEU.18.12	For whoever does these things is an abomination to the 
DEU.18.13	You shall be blameless with the 
DEU.18.14	For these nations that you shall dispossess listen to those who practise sorcery and to diviners; but as for you, the 
DEU.18.15	The 
DEU.18.16	This is according to all that you desired of the 
DEU.18.17	The 
DEU.18.18	I will raise them up a prophet from amongst their brothers, like you. I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him. 
DEU.18.19	It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. 
DEU.18.20	But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.”
DEU.18.21	You may say in your heart, “How shall we know the word which the 
DEU.18.22	When a prophet speaks in the 
DEU.19.1	When the 
DEU.19.2	you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the middle of your land, which the 
DEU.19.3	You shall prepare the way, and divide the borders of your land which the 
DEU.19.4	This is the case of the man slayer who shall flee there and live: Whoever kills his neighbour unintentionally, and didn’t hate him in time past— 
DEU.19.5	as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbour to chop wood and his hand swings the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle and hits his neighbour so that he dies—he shall flee to one of these cities and live. 
DEU.19.6	Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the man slayer while hot anger is in his heart and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally, even though he was not worthy of death, because he didn’t hate him in time past. 
DEU.19.7	Therefore I command you to set apart three cities for yourselves. 
DEU.19.8	If the 
DEU.19.9	and if you keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you today, to love the 
DEU.19.10	This is so that innocent blood will not be shed in the middle of your land which the 
DEU.19.11	But if any man hates his neighbour, lies in wait for him, rises up against him, strikes him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities; 
DEU.19.12	then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 
DEU.19.13	Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the innocent blood from Israel that it may go well with you.
DEU.19.14	You shall not remove your neighbour’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that the 
DEU.19.15	One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin that he sins. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established. 
DEU.19.16	If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing, 
DEU.19.17	then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the 
DEU.19.18	and the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother, 
DEU.19.19	then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother. So you shall remove the evil from amongst you. 
DEU.19.20	Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and will never again commit any such evil amongst you. 
DEU.19.21	Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
DEU.20.1	When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more numerous than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for the 
DEU.20.2	It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people, 
DEU.20.3	and shall tell them, “Hear, Israel, you draw near today to battle against your enemies. Don’t let your heart faint! Don’t be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them; 
DEU.20.4	for the 
DEU.20.5	The officers shall speak to the people, saying, “What man is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. 
DEU.20.6	What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit. 
DEU.20.7	What man is there who has pledged to be married to a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.” 
DEU.20.8	The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, “What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brother’s heart melt as his heart.” 
DEU.20.9	It shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people.
DEU.20.10	When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it. 
DEU.20.11	It shall be, if it gives you answer of peace and opens to you, then it shall be that all the people who are found therein shall become forced labourers to you, and shall serve you. 
DEU.20.12	If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it. 
DEU.20.13	When the 
DEU.20.14	but the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its plunder, you shall take for plunder for yourself. You may use the plunder of your enemies, which the 
DEU.20.15	Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations. 
DEU.20.16	But of the cities of these peoples that the 
DEU.20.17	but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as the 
DEU.20.18	that they not teach you to follow all their abominations, which they have done for their gods; so would you sin against the 
DEU.20.19	When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them. You shall not cut them down, for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged by you? 
DEU.20.20	Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down. You shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.
DEU.21.1	If someone is found slain in the land which the 
DEU.21.2	then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain. 
DEU.21.3	It shall be that the elders of the city which is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn’t been worked with and which has not drawn in the yoke. 
DEU.21.4	The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither ploughed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley. 
DEU.21.5	The priests the sons of Levi shall come near, for them the 
DEU.21.6	All the elders of that city which is nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. 
DEU.21.7	They shall answer and say, “Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. 
DEU.21.8	Forgive, the 
DEU.21.9	So you shall put away the innocent blood from amongst you, when you shall do that which is right in the 
DEU.21.10	When you go out to battle against your enemies, and the 
DEU.21.11	and see amongst the captives a beautiful woman, and you are attracted to her, and desire to take her as your wife, 
DEU.21.12	then you shall bring her home to your house. She shall shave her head and trim her nails. 
DEU.21.13	She shall take off the clothing of her captivity, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month. After that you shall go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife. 
DEU.21.14	It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she desires; but you shall not sell her at all for money. You shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her.
DEU.21.15	If a man has two wives, the one beloved and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated, and if the firstborn son is hers who was hated, 
DEU.21.16	then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not give the son of the beloved the rights of the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn; 
DEU.21.17	but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his.
DEU.21.18	If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not listen to them, 
DEU.21.19	then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his place. 
DEU.21.20	They shall tell the elders of his city, “This our son is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard.” 
DEU.21.21	All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall remove the evil from amongst you. All Israel shall hear, and fear.
DEU.21.22	If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree, 
DEU.21.23	his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God. Don’t defile your land which the 
DEU.22.1	You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep go astray and hide yourself from them. You shall surely bring them again to your brother. 
DEU.22.2	If your brother isn’t near to you, or if you don’t know him, then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall be with you until your brother comes looking for it, and you shall restore it to him. 
DEU.22.3	So you shall do with his donkey. So you shall do with his garment. So you shall do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost and you have found. You may not hide yourself. 
DEU.22.4	You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them. You shall surely help him to lift them up again.
DEU.22.5	A woman shall not wear men’s clothing, neither shall a man put on women’s clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the 
DEU.22.6	If you come across a bird’s nest on the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young. 
DEU.22.7	You shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take for yourself, that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.
DEU.22.8	When you build a new house, then you shall make a railing around your roof, so that you don’t bring blood on your house if anyone falls from there.
DEU.22.9	You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest all the fruit be defiled, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard. 
DEU.22.10	You shall not plough with an ox and a donkey together. 
DEU.22.11	You shall not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
DEU.22.12	You shall make yourselves fringes
DEU.22.13	If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, hates her, 
DEU.22.14	accuses her of shameful things, gives her a bad name, and says, “I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I didn’t find in her the tokens of virginity;” 
DEU.22.15	then the young lady’s father and mother shall take and bring the tokens of the young lady’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate. 
DEU.22.16	The young lady’s father shall tell the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man as his wife, and he hates her. 
DEU.22.17	Behold, he has accused her of shameful things, saying, ‘I didn’t find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;’ and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity.” They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. 
DEU.22.18	The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him. 
DEU.22.19	They shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver,
DEU.22.20	But if this thing is true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady, 
DEU.22.21	then they shall bring out the young lady to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done folly in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father’s house. So you shall remove the evil from amongst you.
DEU.22.22	If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both die, the man who lay with the woman and the woman. So you shall remove the evil from Israel. 
DEU.22.23	If there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband, and a man finds her in the city, and lies with her, 
DEU.22.24	then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the lady, because she didn’t cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbour’s wife. So you shall remove the evil from amongst you. 
DEU.22.25	But if the man finds the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die; 
DEU.22.26	but to the lady you shall do nothing. There is in the lady no sin worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbour and kills him, even so is this matter; 
DEU.22.27	for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was no one to save her. 
DEU.22.28	If a man finds a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, grabs her and lies with her, and they are found, 
DEU.22.29	then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady’s father fifty shekels
DEU.22.30	A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt.
DEU.23.1	He who is emasculated by crushing or cutting shall not enter into the 
DEU.23.2	A person born of a forbidden union shall not enter into the 
DEU.23.3	An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the 
DEU.23.4	because they didn’t meet you with bread and with water on the way when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you. 
DEU.23.5	Nevertheless the 
DEU.23.6	You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever. 
DEU.23.7	You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother. You shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in his land. 
DEU.23.8	The children of the third generation who are born to them may enter into the 
DEU.23.9	When you go out and camp against your enemies, then you shall keep yourselves from every evil thing. 
DEU.23.10	If there is amongst you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens to him by night, then shall he go outside of the camp. He shall not come within the camp; 
DEU.23.11	but it shall be, when evening comes, he shall bathe himself in water. When the sun is down, he shall come within the camp. 
DEU.23.12	You shall have a place also outside of the camp where you go relieve yourself. 
DEU.23.13	You shall have a trowel amongst your weapons. It shall be, when you relieve yourself, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement; 
DEU.23.14	for the 
DEU.23.15	You shall not deliver to his master a servant who has escaped from his master to you. 
DEU.23.16	He shall dwell with you, amongst you, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best. You shall not oppress him.
DEU.23.17	There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel. 
DEU.23.18	You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages of a male prostitute,
DEU.23.19	You shall not lend on interest to your brother: interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest. 
DEU.23.20	You may charge a foreigner interest; but you shall not charge your brother interest, that the 
DEU.23.21	When you vow a vow to the 
DEU.23.22	But if you refrain from making a vow, it shall be no sin in you. 
DEU.23.23	You shall observe and do that which has gone out of your lips. Whatever you have vowed to the 
DEU.23.24	When you come into your neighbour’s vineyard, then you may eat your fill of grapes at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your container. 
DEU.23.25	When you come into your neighbour’s standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not use a sickle on your neighbour’s standing grain.
DEU.24.1	When a man takes a wife and marries her, then it shall be, if she finds no favour in his eyes because he has found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a certificate of divorce, put it in her hand, and send her out of his house. 
DEU.24.2	When she has departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife. 
DEU.24.3	If the latter husband hates her, and write her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the latter husband dies, who took her to be his wife; 
DEU.24.4	her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife after she is defiled; for that would be an abomination to the 
DEU.24.5	When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army, neither shall he be assigned any business. He shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken.
DEU.24.6	No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone as a pledge, for he takes a life in pledge.
DEU.24.7	If a man is found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel, and he deals with him as a slave, or sells him, then that thief shall die. So you shall remove the evil from amongst you.
DEU.24.8	Be careful in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently and do according to all that the Levitical priests teach you. As I commanded them, so you shall observe to do. 
DEU.24.9	Remember what the 
DEU.24.10	When you lend your neighbour any kind of loan, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge. 
DEU.24.11	You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you lend shall bring the pledge outside to you. 
DEU.24.12	If he is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge. 
DEU.24.13	You shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment and bless you. It shall be righteousness to you before the 
DEU.24.14	You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your brothers or one of the foreigners who are in your land within your gates. 
DEU.24.15	In his day you shall give him his wages, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor and sets his heart on it; lest he cry against you to the 
DEU.24.16	The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers. Every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
DEU.24.17	You shall not deprive the foreigner or the fatherless of justice, nor take a widow’s clothing in pledge; 
DEU.24.18	but you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and the 
DEU.24.19	When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it. It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow, that the 
DEU.24.20	When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again. It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
DEU.24.21	When you harvest your vineyard, you shall not glean it after yourselves. It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 
DEU.24.22	You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt. Therefore I command you to do this thing.
DEU.25.1	If there is a controversy between men, and they come to judgement and the judges judge them, then they shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked. 
DEU.25.2	It shall be, if the wicked man is worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by number. 
DEU.25.3	He may sentence him to no more than forty stripes. He shall not give more, lest if he should give more and beat him more than that many stripes, then your brother will be degraded in your sight.
DEU.25.4	You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain.
DEU.25.5	If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the dead shall not be married outside to a stranger. Her husband’s brother shall go in to her, and take her as his wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her. 
DEU.25.6	It shall be that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name not be blotted out of Israel.
DEU.25.7	If the man doesn’t want to take his brother’s wife, then his brother’s wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to raise up to his brother a name in Israel. He will not perform the duty of a husband’s brother to me.” 
DEU.25.8	Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him. If he stands and says, “I don’t want to take her,” 
DEU.25.9	then his brother’s wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his sandal from off his foot, and spit in his face. She shall answer and say, “So shall it be done to the man who does not build up his brother’s house.” 
DEU.25.10	His name shall be called in Israel, “The house of him who had his sandal removed.”
DEU.25.11	When men strive against each other, and the wife of one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him, and puts out her hand, and grabs him by his private parts, 
DEU.25.12	then you shall cut off her hand. Your eye shall have no pity.
DEU.25.13	You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, one heavy and one light. 
DEU.25.14	You shall not have in your house diverse measures, one large and one small. 
DEU.25.15	You shall have a perfect and just weight. You shall have a perfect and just measure, that your days may be long in the land which the 
DEU.25.16	For all who do such things, all who do unrighteously, are an abomination to the 
DEU.25.17	Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came out of Egypt; 
DEU.25.18	how he met you by the way, and struck the rearmost of you, all who were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary; and he didn’t fear God. 
DEU.25.19	Therefore it shall be, when the 
DEU.26.1	It shall be, when you have come in to the land which the 
DEU.26.2	that you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land that the 
DEU.26.3	You shall come to the priest who shall be in those days, and tell him, “I profess today to the 
DEU.26.4	The priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it down before the 
DEU.26.5	You shall answer and say before the 
DEU.26.6	The Egyptians mistreated us, afflicted us, and imposed hard labour on us. 
DEU.26.7	Then we cried to the 
DEU.26.8	The 
DEU.26.9	and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
DEU.26.10	Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which you, the 
DEU.26.11	You shall rejoice in all the good which the 
DEU.26.12	When you have finished tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within your gates and be filled. 
DEU.26.13	You shall say before the 
DEU.26.14	I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor given of it for the dead. I have listened to the 
DEU.26.15	Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the ground which you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.”
DEU.26.16	Today the 
DEU.26.17	You have declared today that the 
DEU.26.18	The 
DEU.26.19	He will make you high above all nations that he has made, in praise, in name, and in honour; and that you may be a holy people to the 
DEU.27.1	Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, “Keep all the commandment which I command you today. 
DEU.27.2	It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which the 
DEU.27.3	You shall write on them all the words of this law, when you have passed over, that you may go in to the land which the 
DEU.27.4	It shall be, when you have crossed over the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you today, on Mount Ebal, and you shall coat them with plaster. 
DEU.27.5	There you shall build an altar to the 
DEU.27.6	You shall build the 
DEU.27.7	You shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there. You shall rejoice before the 
DEU.27.8	You shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.”
DEU.27.9	Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying, “Be silent and listen, Israel! Today you have become the people of the 
DEU.27.10	You shall therefore obey the 
DEU.27.11	Moses commanded the people the same day, saying, 
DEU.27.12	“These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you have crossed over the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 
DEU.27.13	These shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 
DEU.27.14	With a loud voice, the Levites shall say to all the men of Israel, 
DEU.27.15	‘Cursed is the man who makes an engraved or molten image, an abomination to the 
DEU.27.15	All the people shall answer and say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.16	‘Cursed is he who dishonours his father or his mother.’
DEU.27.16	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.17	‘Cursed is he who removes his neighbour’s landmark.’
DEU.27.17	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.18	‘Cursed is he who leads the blind astray on the road.’
DEU.27.18	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.19	‘Cursed is he who withholds justice from the foreigner, fatherless, and widow.’
DEU.27.19	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.20	‘Cursed is he who lies with
DEU.27.20	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.21	‘Cursed is he who lies with any kind of animal.’
DEU.27.21	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.22	‘Cursed is he who lies with his sister, his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter.’
DEU.27.22	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.23	‘Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law.’
DEU.27.23	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.24	‘Cursed is he who secretly kills his neighbour.’
DEU.27.24	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.25	‘Cursed is he who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person.’
DEU.27.25	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
DEU.27.26	‘Cursed is he who doesn’t uphold the words of this law by doing them.’
DEU.27.26	All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’”
DEU.28.1	It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to the 
DEU.28.2	All these blessings will come upon you, and overtake you, if you listen to the 
DEU.28.3	You shall be blessed in the city, and you shall be blessed in the field. 
DEU.28.4	You shall be blessed in the fruit of your body, the fruit of your ground, the fruit of your animals, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock. 
DEU.28.5	Your basket and your kneading trough shall be blessed. 
DEU.28.6	You shall be blessed when you come in, and you shall be blessed when you go out. 
DEU.28.7	The 
DEU.28.8	The 
DEU.28.9	The 
DEU.28.10	All the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the 
DEU.28.11	The 
DEU.28.12	The 
DEU.28.13	The 
DEU.28.14	and shall not turn away from any of the words which I command you today, to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
DEU.28.15	But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to the 
DEU.28.16	You will be cursed in the city, and you will be cursed in the field. 
DEU.28.17	Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed. 
DEU.28.18	The fruit of your body, the fruit of your ground, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock will be cursed. 
DEU.28.19	You will be cursed when you come in, and you will be cursed when you go out. 
DEU.28.20	The 
DEU.28.21	The 
DEU.28.22	The 
DEU.28.23	Your sky that is over your head will be bronze, and the earth that is under you will be iron. 
DEU.28.24	The 
DEU.28.25	The 
DEU.28.26	Your dead bodies will be food to all birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth; and there will be no one to frighten them away. 
DEU.28.27	The 
DEU.28.28	The 
DEU.28.29	You will grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways. You will only be oppressed and robbed always, and there will be no one to save you. 
DEU.28.30	You will betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her. You will build a house, and you won’t dwell in it. You will plant a vineyard, and not use its fruit. 
DEU.28.31	Your ox will be slain before your eyes, and you will not eat any of it. Your donkey will be violently taken away from before your face, and will not be restored to you. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and you will have no one to save you. 
DEU.28.32	Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people. Your eyes will look, and fail with longing for them all day long. There will be no power in your hand. 
DEU.28.33	A nation which you don’t know will eat the fruit of your ground and all of your work. You will only be oppressed and crushed always, 
DEU.28.34	so that the sights that you see with your eyes will drive you mad. 
DEU.28.35	The 
DEU.28.36	The 
DEU.28.37	You will become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword amongst all the peoples where the 
DEU.28.38	You will carry much seed out into the field, and will gather little in, for the locust will consume it. 
DEU.28.39	You will plant vineyards and dress them, but you will neither drink of the wine, nor harvest, because worms will eat them. 
DEU.28.40	You will have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you won’t anoint yourself with the oil, for your olives will drop off. 
DEU.28.41	You will father sons and daughters, but they will not be yours, for they will go into captivity. 
DEU.28.42	Locusts will consume all of your trees and the fruit of your ground. 
DEU.28.43	The foreigner who is amongst you will mount up above you higher and higher, and you will come down lower and lower. 
DEU.28.44	He will lend to you, and you won’t lend to him. He will be the head, and you will be the tail.
DEU.28.45	All these curses will come on you, and will pursue you and overtake you, until you are destroyed, because you didn’t listen to the 
DEU.28.46	They will be for a sign and for a wonder to you and to your offspring forever. 
DEU.28.47	Because you didn’t serve the 
DEU.28.48	therefore you will serve your enemies whom the 
DEU.28.49	The 
DEU.28.50	a nation of fierce facial expressions, that doesn’t respect the elderly, nor show favour to the young. 
DEU.28.51	They will eat the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed. They also won’t leave you grain, new wine, oil, the increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish. 
DEU.28.52	They will besiege you in all your gates until your high and fortified walls in which you trusted come down throughout all your land. They will besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land which the 
DEU.28.53	You will eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom the 
DEU.28.54	The man who is tender amongst you, and very delicate, his eye will be evil towards his brother, towards the wife whom he loves, and towards the remnant of his children whom he has remaining, 
DEU.28.55	so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he will eat, because he has nothing left to him, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in all your gates. 
DEU.28.56	The tender and delicate woman amongst you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye will be evil towards the husband that she loves, towards her son, towards her daughter, 
DEU.28.57	towards her young one who comes out from between her feet, and towards her children whom she bears; for she will eat them secretly for lack of all things in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in your gates. 
DEU.28.58	If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, THE 
DEU.28.59	then the 
DEU.28.60	He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they will cling to you. 
DEU.28.61	Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, the 
DEU.28.62	You will be left few in number, even though you were as the stars of the sky for multitude, because you didn’t listen to the 
DEU.28.63	It will happen that as the 
DEU.28.64	The 
DEU.28.65	Amongst these nations you will find no ease, and there will be no rest for the sole of your foot; but the 
DEU.28.66	Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will be afraid night and day, and will have no assurance of your life. 
DEU.28.67	In the morning you will say, “I wish it were evening!” and at evening you will say, “I wish it were morning!” for the fear of your heart which you will fear, and for the sights which your eyes will see. 
DEU.28.68	The 
DEU.29.1	These are the words of the covenant which the 
DEU.29.2	Moses called to all Israel, and said to them:
DEU.29.2	Your eyes have seen all that the 
DEU.29.3	the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders. 
DEU.29.4	But the 
DEU.29.5	I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not grown old on you, and your sandals have not grown old on your feet. 
DEU.29.6	You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am the 
DEU.29.7	When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we struck them. 
DEU.29.8	We took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites. 
DEU.29.9	Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do. 
DEU.29.10	All of you stand today in the presence of the 
DEU.29.11	your little ones, your wives, and the foreigners who are in the middle of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water, 
DEU.29.12	that you may enter into the covenant of the 
DEU.29.13	that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may be your God, as he spoke to you and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
DEU.29.14	Neither do I make this covenant and this oath with you only, 
DEU.29.15	but with those who stand here with us today before the 
DEU.29.16	(for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the middle of the nations through which you passed; 
DEU.29.17	and you have seen their abominations and their idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which were amongst them); 
DEU.29.18	lest there should be amongst you man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart turns away today from the 
DEU.29.19	and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, “I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,” to destroy the moist with the dry. 
DEU.29.20	The 
DEU.29.21	The 
DEU.29.22	The generation to come—your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will come from a far land—will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which the 
DEU.29.23	that all of its land is sulphur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, doesn’t produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the 
DEU.29.24	Even all the nations will say, “Why has the 
DEU.29.25	Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of the 
DEU.29.26	and went and served other gods and worshipped them, gods that they didn’t know and that he had not given to them. 
DEU.29.27	Therefore the 
DEU.29.28	The 
DEU.29.29	The secret things belong to the 
DEU.30.1	It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind amongst all the nations where the 
DEU.30.2	and return to the 
DEU.30.3	that then the 
DEU.30.4	If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there the 
DEU.30.5	The 
DEU.30.6	The 
DEU.30.7	The 
DEU.30.8	You shall return and obey the 
DEU.30.9	The 
DEU.30.10	if you will obey the 
DEU.30.11	For this commandment which I command you today is not too hard for you or too distant. 
DEU.30.12	It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up for us to heaven, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?” 
DEU.30.13	Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the sea for us, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?” 
DEU.30.14	But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it. 
DEU.30.15	Behold, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and evil. 
DEU.30.16	For I command you today to love the 
DEU.30.17	But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away and worship other gods, and serve them, 
DEU.30.18	I declare to you today that you will surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it. 
DEU.30.19	I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your descendants, 
DEU.30.20	to love the 
DEU.31.1	Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 
DEU.31.2	He said to them, “I am one hundred and twenty years old today. I can no more go out and come in. The 
DEU.31.3	The 
DEU.31.4	The 
DEU.31.5	The 
DEU.31.6	Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or scared of them; for the 
DEU.31.7	Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which the 
DEU.31.8	The 
DEU.31.9	Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the 
DEU.31.10	Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths, 
DEU.31.11	when all Israel has come to appear before the 
DEU.31.12	Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and the foreigners who are within your gates, that they may hear, learn, fear the 
DEU.31.13	and that their children, who have not known, may hear and learn to fear the 
DEU.31.14	The 
DEU.31.14	Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.
DEU.31.15	The 
DEU.31.16	The 
DEU.31.17	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t these evils come on us because our God is not amongst us?’ 
DEU.31.18	I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods.
DEU.31.19	“Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. 
DEU.31.20	For when I have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat, then they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant. 
DEU.31.21	It will happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths of their descendants; for I know their ways and what they are doing today, before I have brought them into the land which I promised them.”
DEU.31.22	So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.
DEU.31.23	He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them. I will be with you.”
DEU.31.24	When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 
DEU.31.25	Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the 
DEU.31.26	“Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the 
DEU.31.27	For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you today, you have been rebellious against the 
DEU.31.28	Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. 
DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn away from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days, because you will do that which is evil in the 
DEU.31.30	Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.
DEU.32.1	Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.
DEU.32.1	Let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
DEU.32.2	My doctrine will drop as the rain.
DEU.32.2	My speech will condense as the dew,
DEU.32.2	as the misty rain on the tender grass,
DEU.32.2	as the showers on the herb.
DEU.32.3	For I will proclaim the 
DEU.32.3	Ascribe greatness to our God!
DEU.32.4	The Rock: his work is perfect,
DEU.32.4	for all his ways are just.
DEU.32.4	A God of faithfulness who does no wrong,
DEU.32.4	just and right is he.
DEU.32.5	They have dealt corruptly with him.
DEU.32.5	They are not his children, because of their defect.
DEU.32.5	They are a perverse and crooked generation.
DEU.32.6	Is this the way you repay the 
DEU.32.6	foolish and unwise people?
DEU.32.6	Isn’t he your father who has bought you?
DEU.32.6	He has made you and established you.
DEU.32.7	Remember the days of old.
DEU.32.7	Consider the years of many generations.
DEU.32.7	Ask your father, and he will show you;
DEU.32.7	your elders, and they will tell you.
DEU.32.8	When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,
DEU.32.8	when he separated the children of men,
DEU.32.8	he set the bounds of the peoples
DEU.32.8	according to the number of the children of Israel.
DEU.32.9	For the 
DEU.32.9	Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
DEU.32.10	He found him in a desert land,
DEU.32.10	in the waste howling wilderness.
DEU.32.10	He surrounded him.
DEU.32.10	He cared for him.
DEU.32.10	He kept him as the apple of his eye.
DEU.32.11	As an eagle that stirs up her nest,
DEU.32.11	that flutters over her young,
DEU.32.11	he spread abroad his wings,
DEU.32.11	he took them,
DEU.32.11	he bore them on his feathers.
DEU.32.12	The 
DEU.32.12	There was no foreign god with him.
DEU.32.13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth.
DEU.32.13	He ate the increase of the field.
DEU.32.13	He caused him to suck honey out of the rock,
DEU.32.13	oil out of the flinty rock;
DEU.32.14	butter from the herd, and milk from the flock,
DEU.32.14	with fat of lambs,
DEU.32.14	rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,
DEU.32.14	with the finest of the wheat.
DEU.32.14	From the blood of the grape, you drank wine.
DEU.32.15	But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.
DEU.32.15	You have grown fat.
DEU.32.15	You have grown thick.
DEU.32.15	You have become sleek.
DEU.32.15	Then he abandoned God who made him,
DEU.32.15	and rejected the Rock of his salvation.
DEU.32.16	They moved him to jealousy with strange gods.
DEU.32.16	They provoked him to anger with abominations.
DEU.32.17	They sacrificed to demons, not God,
DEU.32.17	to gods that they didn’t know,
DEU.32.17	to new gods that came up recently,
DEU.32.17	which your fathers didn’t dread.
DEU.32.18	Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,
DEU.32.18	and have forgotten God who gave you birth.
DEU.32.19	The 
DEU.32.19	because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
DEU.32.20	He said, “I will hide my face from them.
DEU.32.20	I will see what their end will be;
DEU.32.20	for they are a very perverse generation,
DEU.32.20	children in whom is no faithfulness.
DEU.32.21	They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.
DEU.32.21	They have provoked me to anger with their vanities.
DEU.32.21	I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.
DEU.32.21	I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
DEU.32.22	For a fire is kindled in my anger,
DEU.32.22	that burns to the lowest Sheol,
DEU.32.22	devours the earth with its increase,
DEU.32.22	and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.
DEU.32.23	“I will heap evils on them.
DEU.32.23	I will spend my arrows on them.
DEU.32.24	They shall be wasted with hunger,
DEU.32.24	and devoured with burning heat
DEU.32.24	and bitter destruction.
DEU.32.24	I will send the teeth of animals on them,
DEU.32.24	with the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.
DEU.32.25	Outside the sword will bereave,
DEU.32.25	and in the rooms,
DEU.32.25	terror on both young man and virgin,
DEU.32.25	the nursing infant with the grey-haired man.
DEU.32.26	I said that I would scatter them afar.
DEU.32.26	I would make their memory to cease from amongst men;
DEU.32.27	were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,
DEU.32.27	lest their adversaries should judge wrongly,
DEU.32.27	lest they should say, ‘Our hand is exalted,
DEU.32.27	The 
DEU.32.28	For they are a nation void of counsel.
DEU.32.28	There is no understanding in them.
DEU.32.29	Oh that they were wise, that they understood this,
DEU.32.29	that they would consider their latter end!
DEU.32.30	How could one chase a thousand,
DEU.32.30	and two put ten thousand to flight,
DEU.32.30	unless their Rock had sold them,
DEU.32.30	and the 
DEU.32.31	For their rock is not as our Rock,
DEU.32.31	even our enemies themselves concede.
DEU.32.32	For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,
DEU.32.32	of the fields of Gomorrah.
DEU.32.32	Their grapes are poison grapes.
DEU.32.32	Their clusters are bitter.
DEU.32.33	Their wine is the poison of serpents,
DEU.32.33	the cruel venom of asps.
DEU.32.34	“Isn’t this laid up in store with me,
DEU.32.34	sealed up amongst my treasures?
DEU.32.35	Vengeance is mine, and recompense,
DEU.32.35	at the time when their foot slides;
DEU.32.35	for the day of their calamity is at hand.
DEU.32.35	Their doom rushes at them.”
DEU.32.36	For the 
DEU.32.36	and have compassion on his servants,
DEU.32.36	when he sees that their power is gone;
DEU.32.36	that there is no one remaining, shut up or left at large.
DEU.32.37	He will say, “Where are their gods,
DEU.32.37	the rock in which they took refuge;
DEU.32.38	which ate the fat of their sacrifices,
DEU.32.38	and drank the wine of their drink offering?
DEU.32.38	Let them rise up and help you!
DEU.32.38	Let them be your protection.
DEU.32.39	“See now that I myself am he.
DEU.32.39	There is no god with me.
DEU.32.39	I kill and I make alive.
DEU.32.39	I wound and I heal.
DEU.32.39	There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.
DEU.32.40	For I lift up my hand to heaven and declare,
DEU.32.40	as I live forever,
DEU.32.41	if I sharpen my glittering sword,
DEU.32.41	my hand grasps it in judgement;
DEU.32.41	I will take vengeance on my adversaries,
DEU.32.41	and will repay those who hate me.
DEU.32.42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood.
DEU.32.42	My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives,
DEU.32.42	from the head of the leaders of the enemy.”
DEU.32.43	Rejoice, you nations, with his people,
DEU.32.43	for he will avenge the blood of his servants.
DEU.32.43	He will take vengeance on his adversaries,
DEU.32.43	and will make atonement for his land and for his people.
DEU.32.44	Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun. 
DEU.32.45	Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel. 
DEU.32.46	He said to them, “Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you today, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. 
DEU.32.47	For it is no vain thing for you, because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”
DEU.32.48	The 
DEU.32.49	“Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession. 
DEU.32.50	Die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people; 
DEU.32.51	because you trespassed against me amongst the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn’t uphold my holiness amongst the children of Israel. 
DEU.32.52	For you shall see the land from a distance; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel.”
DEU.33.1	This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. 
DEU.33.2	He said,
DEU.33.2	“The 
DEU.33.2	and rose from Seir to them.
DEU.33.2	He shone from Mount Paran.
DEU.33.2	He came from the ten thousands of holy ones.
DEU.33.2	At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
DEU.33.3	Yes, he loves the people.
DEU.33.3	All his saints are in your hand.
DEU.33.3	They sat down at your feet.
DEU.33.3	Each receives your words.
DEU.33.4	Moses commanded us a law,
DEU.33.4	an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
DEU.33.5	He was king in Jeshurun,
DEU.33.5	when the heads of the people were gathered,
DEU.33.5	all the tribes of Israel together.
DEU.33.6	“Let Reuben live, and not die;
DEU.33.6	Nor let his men be few.”
DEU.33.7	This is for Judah. He said,
DEU.33.7	“Hear, 
DEU.33.7	Bring him in to his people.
DEU.33.7	With his hands he contended for himself.
DEU.33.7	You shall be a help against his adversaries.”
DEU.33.8	About Levi he said,
DEU.33.8	“Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one,
DEU.33.8	whom you proved at Massah,
DEU.33.8	with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah.
DEU.33.9	He said of his father, and of his mother, ‘I have not seen him.’
DEU.33.9	He didn’t acknowledge his brothers,
DEU.33.9	nor did he know his own children;
DEU.33.9	for they have observed your word,
DEU.33.9	and keep your covenant.
DEU.33.10	They shall teach Jacob your ordinances,
DEU.33.10	and Israel your law.
DEU.33.10	They shall put incense before you,
DEU.33.10	and whole burnt offering on your altar.
DEU.33.11	, bless his skills.
DEU.33.11	Accept the work of his hands.
DEU.33.11	Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him,
DEU.33.11	of those who hate him, that they not rise again.”
DEU.33.12	About Benjamin he said,
DEU.33.12	“The beloved of the 
DEU.33.12	He covers him all day long.
DEU.33.12	He dwells between his shoulders.”
DEU.33.13	About Joseph he said,
DEU.33.13	“His land is blessed by the 
DEU.33.13	for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew,
DEU.33.13	for the deep that couches beneath,
DEU.33.14	for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,
DEU.33.14	for the precious things that the moon can yield,
DEU.33.15	for the best things of the ancient mountains,
DEU.33.15	for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
DEU.33.16	for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,
DEU.33.16	the good will of him who lived in the bush.
DEU.33.16	Let this come on the head of Joseph,
DEU.33.16	on the crown of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.
DEU.33.17	Majesty belongs to the firstborn of his herd.
DEU.33.17	His horns are the horns of the wild ox.
DEU.33.17	With them he will push all the peoples to the ends of the earth.
DEU.33.17	They are the ten thousands of Ephraim.
DEU.33.17	They are the thousands of Manasseh.”
DEU.33.18	About Zebulun he said,
DEU.33.18	“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
DEU.33.18	and Issachar, in your tents.
DEU.33.19	They will call the peoples to the mountain.
DEU.33.19	There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness,
DEU.33.19	for they will draw out the abundance of the seas,
DEU.33.19	the hidden treasures of the sand.”
DEU.33.20	About Gad he said,
DEU.33.20	“He who enlarges Gad is blessed.
DEU.33.20	He dwells as a lioness,
DEU.33.20	and tears the arm and the crown of the head.
DEU.33.21	He provided the first part for himself,
DEU.33.21	for the lawgiver’s portion reserved was reserved for him.
DEU.33.21	He came with the heads of the people.
DEU.33.21	He executed the righteousness of the 
DEU.33.21	His ordinances with Israel.”
DEU.33.22	About Dan he said,
DEU.33.22	“Dan is a lion’s cub
DEU.33.22	that leaps out of Bashan.”
DEU.33.23	About Naphtali he said,
DEU.33.23	“Naphtali, satisfied with favour,
DEU.33.23	full of the 
DEU.33.23	Possess the west and the south.”
DEU.33.24	About Asher he said,
DEU.33.24	“Asher is blessed with children.
DEU.33.24	Let him be acceptable to his brothers.
DEU.33.24	Let him dip his foot in oil.
DEU.33.25	Your bars will be iron and bronze.
DEU.33.25	As your days, so your strength will be.
DEU.33.26	“There is no one like God, Jeshurun,
DEU.33.26	who rides on the heavens for your help,
DEU.33.26	in his excellency on the skies.
DEU.33.27	The eternal God is your dwelling place.
DEU.33.27	Underneath are the everlasting arms.
DEU.33.27	He thrust out the enemy from before you,
DEU.33.27	and said, ‘Destroy!’
DEU.33.28	Israel dwells in safety,
DEU.33.28	the fountain of Jacob alone,
DEU.33.28	In a land of grain and new wine.
DEU.33.28	Yes, his heavens drop down dew.
DEU.33.29	You are happy, Israel!
DEU.33.29	Who is like you, a people saved by the 
DEU.33.29	the shield of your help,
DEU.33.29	the sword of your excellency?
DEU.33.29	Your enemies will submit themselves to you.
DEU.33.29	You will tread on their high places.”
DEU.34.1	Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite Jericho. The 
DEU.34.2	and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the Western Sea, 
DEU.34.3	and the south,
DEU.34.4	The 
DEU.34.5	So Moses the servant of the 
DEU.34.6	He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor, but no man knows where his tomb is to this day. 
DEU.34.7	Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his strength gone. 
DEU.34.8	The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended. 
DEU.34.9	Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. The children of Israel listened to him, and did as the 
DEU.34.10	Since then, there has not arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the 
DEU.34.11	in all the signs and the wonders which the 
DEU.34.12	and in all the mighty hand, and in all the awesome deeds, which Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	Now after the death of Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.2	“Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go across this Jordan, you and all these people, to the land which I am giving to them, even to the children of Israel. 
JOS.1.3	I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses. 
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea towards the going down of the sun, shall be your border. 
JOS.1.5	No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.
JOS.1.6	“Be strong and courageous; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. 
JOS.1.7	Only be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded you. Don’t turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go. 
JOS.1.8	This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success. 
JOS.1.9	Haven’t I commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be dismayed, for the 
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 
JOS.1.11	“Pass through the middle of the camp, and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the 
JOS.1.12	Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying, 
JOS.1.13	“Remember the word which Moses the servant of the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valour, and shall help them 
JOS.1.15	until the 
JOS.1.16	They answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 
JOS.1.17	Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may the 
JOS.1.18	Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn’t listen to your words in all that you command him shall himself be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”
JOS.2.1	Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, including Jericho.” They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and slept there.
JOS.2.2	The king of Jericho was told, “Behold,
JOS.2.3	Jericho’s king sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered into your house; for they have come to spy out all the land.”
JOS.2.4	The woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I didn’t know where they came from. 
JOS.2.5	About the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, the men went out. Where the men went, I don’t know. Pursue them quickly. You may catch up with them.” 
JOS.2.6	But she had brought them up to the roof, and hidden them under the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof. 
JOS.2.7	The men pursued them along the way to the fords of the Jordan River. As soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate. 
JOS.2.8	Before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof. 
JOS.2.9	She said to the men, “I know that the 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, and there wasn’t any more spirit in any man, because of you: for the 
JOS.2.12	Now therefore, please swear to me by the 
JOS.2.13	and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.”
JOS.2.14	The men said to her, “Our life for yours, if you don’t talk about this business of ours; and it shall be, when the 
JOS.2.15	Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on the wall. 
JOS.2.16	She said to them, “Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you. Hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your way.”
JOS.2.17	The men said to her, “We will be guiltless of this your oath which you’ve made us to swear. 
JOS.2.18	Behold, when we come into the land, tie this line of scarlet thread in the window which you used to let us down. Gather to yourself into the house your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household. 
JOS.2.19	It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him. 
JOS.2.20	But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you’ve made us to swear.”
JOS.2.21	She said, “Let it be as you have said.” She sent them away, and they departed. Then she tied the scarlet line in the window.
JOS.2.22	They went and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them all along the way, but didn’t find them. 
JOS.2.23	Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain, crossed the river, and came to Joshua the son of Nun. They told him all that had happened to them. 
JOS.2.24	They said to Joshua, “Truly the 
JOS.3.1	Joshua got up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel. They camped there before they crossed over. 
JOS.3.2	After three days, the officers went through the middle of the camp; 
JOS.3.3	and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the 
JOS.3.4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits
JOS.3.5	Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow the 
JOS.3.6	Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and cross over before the people.” They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
JOS.3.7	The 
JOS.3.8	You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’”
JOS.3.9	Joshua said to the children of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of the 
JOS.3.10	Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is amongst you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite out from before you. 
JOS.3.11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord
JOS.3.12	Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man. 
JOS.3.13	It shall be that when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the 
JOS.3.14	When the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people, 
JOS.3.15	and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest), 
JOS.3.16	the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down towards the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people passed over near Jericho. 
JOS.3.17	The priests who bore the ark of the 
JOS.4.1	When all the nation had completely crossed over the Jordan, the 
JOS.4.2	“Take twelve men out of the people, a man out of every tribe, 
JOS.4.3	and command them, saying, ‘Take from out of the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, carry them over with you, and lay them down in the place where you’ll camp tonight.’”
JOS.4.4	Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, a man out of every tribe. 
JOS.4.5	Joshua said to them, “Cross before the ark of the 
JOS.4.6	that this may be a sign amongst you, that when your children ask in the future, saying, ‘What do you mean by these stones?’ 
JOS.4.7	then you shall tell them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the 
JOS.4.8	The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as the 
JOS.4.9	Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day. 
JOS.4.10	For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything was finished that the 
JOS.4.11	When all the people had completely crossed over, the 
JOS.4.12	The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them. 
JOS.4.13	About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war, passed over before the 
JOS.4.14	On that day, the 
JOS.4.15	The 
JOS.4.16	“Command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, that they come up out of the Jordan.”
JOS.4.17	Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, “Come up out of the Jordan!” 
JOS.4.18	When the priests who bore the ark of the 
JOS.4.19	The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.
JOS.4.20	Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal. 
JOS.4.21	He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’ 
JOS.4.22	Then you shall let your children know, saying, ‘Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. 
JOS.4.23	For the 
JOS.4.24	that all the peoples of the earth may know that the 
JOS.5.1	When all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how the 
JOS.5.2	At that time, the 
JOS.5.3	Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. 
JOS.5.4	This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way, after they came out of Egypt. 
JOS.5.5	For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised. 
JOS.5.6	For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they didn’t listen to the 
JOS.5.7	Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way. 
JOS.5.8	When they were done circumcising the whole nation, they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed.
JOS.5.9	The 
JOS.5.10	The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho. 
JOS.5.11	They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day. 
JOS.5.12	The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel didn’t have manna any more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
JOS.5.13	When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our enemies?”
JOS.5.14	He said, “No; but I have come now as commander of the 
JOS.5.14	Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and asked him, “What does my lord say to his servant?”
JOS.5.15	The prince of the 
JOS.6.1	Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in. 
JOS.6.2	The 
JOS.6.3	All of your men of war shall march around the city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days. 
JOS.6.4	Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. 
JOS.6.5	It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the city wall will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, every man straight in front of him.”
JOS.6.6	Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the 
JOS.6.7	They said to the people, “Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the 
JOS.6.8	It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the 
JOS.6.9	The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets sounded as they went.
JOS.6.10	Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.” 
JOS.6.11	So he caused the 
JOS.6.12	Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the 
JOS.6.13	The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the 
JOS.6.14	The second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days.
JOS.6.15	On the seventh day, they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. On this day only they marched around the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for the 
JOS.6.17	The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to the 
JOS.6.18	But as for you, only keep yourselves from what is devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so you would make the camp of Israel accursed and trouble it. 
JOS.6.19	But all the silver, gold, and vessels of bronze and iron are holy to the 
JOS.6.20	So the people shouted and the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight in front of him, and they took the city. 
JOS.6.21	They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.6.22	Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house, and bring the woman and all that she has out from there, as you swore to her.” 
JOS.6.23	The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all of her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Israel. 
JOS.6.24	They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron into the treasury of the 
JOS.6.25	But Rahab the prostitute, her father’s household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lives in the middle of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
JOS.6.26	Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed is the man before the 
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. Therefore the 
JOS.7.2	Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.”
JOS.7.2	The men went up and spied out Ai. 
JOS.7.3	They returned to Joshua, and said to him, “Don’t let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Don’t make all the people to toil there, for there are only a few of them.” 
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai. 
JOS.7.5	The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of them. They chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became like water. 
JOS.7.6	Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the 
JOS.7.7	Joshua said, “Alas, Lord GOD, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan! 
JOS.7.8	Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after Israel has turned their backs before their enemies? 
JOS.7.9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?”
JOS.7.10	The 
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken some of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it amongst their own stuff. 
JOS.7.12	Therefore the children of Israel can’t stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from amongst you. 
JOS.7.13	Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for the 
JOS.7.14	In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. It shall be that the tribe which the 
JOS.7.15	It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the 
JOS.7.16	So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes. The tribe of Judah was selected. 
JOS.7.17	He brought near the family of Judah, and he selected the family of the Zerahites. He brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was selected. 
JOS.7.18	He brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected. 
JOS.7.19	Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please give glory to the 
JOS.7.20	Achan answered Joshua, and said, “I have truly sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	When I saw amongst the plunder a beautiful Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it. 
JOS.7.23	They took them from the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel. They laid them down before the 
JOS.7.24	Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor. 
JOS.7.25	Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? The 
JOS.7.26	They raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. The 
JOS.8.1	The 
JOS.8.2	You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king, except you shall take its goods and its livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it.”
JOS.8.3	So Joshua arose, with all the warriors, to go up to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valour, and sent them out by night. 
JOS.8.4	He commanded them, saying, “Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Don’t go very far from the city, but all of you be ready. 
JOS.8.5	I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them. 
JOS.8.6	They will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, ‘They flee before us, like the first time.’ So we will flee before them, 
JOS.8.7	and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for the 
JOS.8.8	It shall be, when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do this according to the 
JOS.8.9	Joshua sent them out; and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai on the west side of Ai; but Joshua stayed amongst the people that night. 
JOS.8.10	Joshua rose up early in the morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	All the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up and came near, and came before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai. 
JOS.8.12	He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. 
JOS.8.13	So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the middle of the valley. 
JOS.8.14	When the king of Ai saw it, they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he didn’t know that there was an ambush against him behind the city. 
JOS.8.15	Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 
JOS.8.16	All the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them. They pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who didn’t go out after Israel. They left the city open, and pursued Israel.
JOS.8.18	The 
JOS.8.18	Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand towards the city. 
JOS.8.19	The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and entered into the city and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire. 
JOS.8.20	When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. The people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers. 
JOS.8.21	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned back and killed the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	The others came out of the city against them, so they were in the middle of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. They struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. 
JOS.8.23	They captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword. 
JOS.8.25	All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the people of Ai. 
JOS.8.26	For Joshua didn’t draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 
JOS.8.27	Israel took for themselves only the livestock and the goods of that city, according to the 
JOS.8.28	So Joshua burnt Ai and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day. 
JOS.8.29	He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the evening. At sundown, Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a great heap of stones on it that remains to this day.
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built an altar to the 
JOS.8.31	as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.8.32	He wrote there on the stones a copy of Moses’ law, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 
JOS.8.33	All Israel, with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests, who carried the ark of the 
JOS.8.34	Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua didn’t read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were amongst them.
JOS.9.1	When all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it 
JOS.9.2	they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord. 
JOS.9.3	But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai, 
JOS.9.4	they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys, and old, torn-up and bound up wine skins, 
JOS.9.5	and old and patched sandals on their feet, and wore old garments. All the bread of their food supply was dry and mouldy. 
JOS.9.6	They went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country. Now therefore make a covenant with us.”
JOS.9.7	The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “What if you live amongst us? How could we make a covenant with you?”
JOS.9.8	They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.”
JOS.9.8	Joshua said to them, “Who are you? Where do you come from?”
JOS.9.9	They said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of the 
JOS.9.10	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take supplies in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them. Tell them, “We are your servants. Now make a covenant with us.”’ 
JOS.9.12	This our bread we took hot for our supplies out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and has become mouldy. 
JOS.9.13	These wine skins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.”
JOS.9.14	The men sampled their provisions, and didn’t ask counsel from the 
JOS.9.15	Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation swore to them. 
JOS.9.16	At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they lived amongst them. 
JOS.9.17	The children of Israel travelled and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim. 
JOS.9.18	The children of Israel didn’t strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the 
JOS.9.19	But all the princes said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by the 
JOS.9.20	We will do this to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them.” 
JOS.9.21	The princes said to them, “Let them live.” So they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them.
JOS.9.22	Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you live amongst us? 
JOS.9.23	Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be slaves, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.”
JOS.9.24	They answered Joshua, and said, “Because your servants were certainly told how the 
JOS.9.25	Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do.”
JOS.9.26	He did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they didn’t kill them. 
JOS.9.27	That day Joshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the 
JOS.10.1	Now when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were amongst them, 
JOS.10.2	they were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty. 
JOS.10.3	Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
JOS.10.4	“Come up to me and help me. Let’s strike Gibeon; for they have made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.” 
JOS.10.5	Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it. 
JOS.10.6	The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Don’t abandon your servants! Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us.”
JOS.10.7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and the whole army with him, including all the mighty men of valour. 
JOS.10.8	The 
JOS.10.9	Joshua therefore came to them suddenly. He marched from Gilgal all night. 
JOS.10.10	The 
JOS.10.11	As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, the 
JOS.10.12	Then Joshua spoke to the 
JOS.10.13	The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn’t this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the middle of the sky, and didn’t hurry to go down about a whole day. 
JOS.10.14	There was no day like that before it or after it, that the 
JOS.10.15	Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal. 
JOS.10.16	These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	Joshua was told, saying, “The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”
JOS.10.18	Joshua said, “Roll large stones to cover the cave’s entrance, and set men by it to guard them; 
JOS.10.19	but don’t stay there. Pursue your enemies, and attack them from the rear. Don’t allow them to enter into their cities; for the 
JOS.10.20	When Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities, 
JOS.10.21	all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. 
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, “Open the cave entrance, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me.”
JOS.10.23	They did so, and brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	When they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, “Come near. Put your feet on the necks of these kings.”
JOS.10.24	They came near, and put their feet on their necks.
JOS.10.25	Joshua said to them, “Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and courageous, for the 
JOS.10.26	Afterward Joshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging on the trees until the evening. 
JOS.10.27	At the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and threw them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.
JOS.10.28	Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He utterly destroyed it and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining. He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
JOS.10.29	Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah. 
JOS.10.30	The 
JOS.10.31	Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it. 
JOS.10.32	The 
JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him no one remaining.
JOS.10.34	Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it and fought against it. 
JOS.10.35	They took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
JOS.10.36	Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it. 
JOS.10.37	They took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king and all its cities, and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were in it.
JOS.10.38	Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it. 
JOS.10.39	He took it, with its king and all its cities. They struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining. As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king. 
JOS.10.40	So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, the South, the lowland, the slopes, and all their kings. He left no one remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the 
JOS.10.41	Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time because the 
JOS.10.43	Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	When Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph, 
JOS.11.2	and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west, 
JOS.11.3	to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 
JOS.11.4	They went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots. 
JOS.11.5	All these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
JOS.11.6	The 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua came suddenly, with all the warriors, against them by the waters of Merom, and attacked them. 
JOS.11.8	The 
JOS.11.9	Joshua did to them as the 
JOS.11.10	Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms. 
JOS.11.11	They struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left who breathed. He burnt Hazor with fire. 
JOS.11.12	Joshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.11.13	But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burnt none of them, except Hazor only. Joshua burnt that. 
JOS.11.14	The children of Israel took all the plunder of these cities, with the livestock, as plunder for themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They didn’t leave any who breathed.
JOS.11.15	As the 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same; 
JOS.11.17	from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death. 
JOS.11.18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 
JOS.11.19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all in battle. 
JOS.11.20	For it was of the 
JOS.11.21	Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. 
JOS.11.22	There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain. 
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the 
JOS.12.1	Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan towards the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward: 
JOS.12.2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon; 
JOS.12.3	and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah: 
JOS.12.4	and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 
JOS.12.5	and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. 
JOS.12.6	Moses the servant of the 
JOS.12.7	These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir. Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions; 
JOS.12.8	in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
JOS.12.9	the king of Jericho, one;
JOS.12.9	the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
JOS.12.10	the king of Jerusalem, one;
JOS.12.10	the king of Hebron, one;
JOS.12.11	the king of Jarmuth, one;
JOS.12.11	the king of Lachish, one;

JOS.12.14	the king of Arad, one;
JOS.12.15	the king of Libnah, one;
JOS.12.15	the king of Adullam, one;
JOS.12.16	the king of Makkedah, one;
JOS.12.16	the king of Bethel, one;
JOS.12.17	the king of Tappuah, one;
JOS.12.17	the king of Hepher, one;
JOS.12.18	the king of Aphek, one;
JOS.12.18	the king of Lassharon, one;
JOS.12.19	the king of Madon, one;
JOS.12.19	the king of Hazor, one;
JOS.12.20	the king of Shimron Meron, one;
JOS.12.20	the king of Achshaph, one;
JOS.12.21	the king of Taanach, one;
JOS.12.21	the king of Megiddo, one;
JOS.12.22	the king of Kedesh, one;
JOS.12.22	the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
JOS.12.23	the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one;
JOS.12.23	the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;
JOS.12.24	the king of Tirzah, one:
JOS.12.24	all the kings thirty-one.
JOS.13.1	Now Joshua was old and well advanced in years. The 
JOS.13.2	“This is the land that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites; 
JOS.13.3	from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border of Ekron northward, which is counted as Canaanite; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim, 
JOS.13.4	on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border of the Amorites; 
JOS.13.5	and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, towards the sunrise, from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath; 
JOS.13.6	all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians. I will drive them out from before the children of Israel. Just allocate it to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you. 
JOS.13.7	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.” 
JOS.13.8	With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the 
JOS.13.9	from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon; 
JOS.13.10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon; 
JOS.13.11	and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah; 
JOS.13.12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (who was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses attacked these, and drove them out. 
JOS.13.13	Nevertheless the children of Israel didn’t drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath live within Israel to this day. 
JOS.13.14	Only he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The offerings of the 
JOS.13.15	Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families. 
JOS.13.16	Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba; 
JOS.13.17	Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon, 
JOS.13.18	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar in the mount of the valley, 
JOS.13.20	Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth Jeshimoth, 
JOS.13.21	all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land. 
JOS.13.22	The children of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword, amongst the rest of their slain.
JOS.13.23	The border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and its villages.
JOS.13.24	Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad, according to their families. 
JOS.13.25	Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is near Rabbah; 
JOS.13.26	and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir; 
JOS.13.27	and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan’s bank, to the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward. 
JOS.13.28	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages.
JOS.13.29	Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families. 
JOS.13.30	Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities. 
JOS.13.31	Half Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families.
JOS.13.32	These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward. 
JOS.13.33	But Moses gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The 
JOS.14.1	These are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed to them, 
JOS.14.2	by the lot of their inheritance, as the 
JOS.14.3	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance amongst them. 
JOS.14.4	For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. They gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property. 
JOS.14.5	The children of Israel did as the 
JOS.14.6	Then the children of Judah came near to Joshua in Gilgal. Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the thing that the 
JOS.14.7	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the 
JOS.14.8	Nevertheless, my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed the 
JOS.14.9	Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land where you walked shall be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have wholly followed the 
JOS.14.10	“Now, behold, the 
JOS.14.11	As yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, to go out and to come in. 
JOS.14.12	Now therefore give me this hill country, of which the 
JOS.14.13	Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. 
JOS.14.14	Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he followed the 
JOS.14.15	Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba, after the greatest man amongst the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.
JOS.15.1	The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south. 
JOS.15.2	Their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looks southward; 
JOS.15.3	and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea, and passed along by Hezron, went up to Addar, and turned towards Karka; 
JOS.15.4	and it passed along to Azmon, went out at the brook of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your south border. 
JOS.15.5	The east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Jordan. The border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan. 
JOS.15.6	The border went up to Beth Hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 
JOS.15.7	The border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking towards Gilgal, that faces the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river. The border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh, and ended at En Rogel. 
JOS.15.8	The border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite (also called Jerusalem) southward; and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the farthest part of the valley of Rephaim northward. 
JOS.15.9	The border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (also called Kiriath Jearim); 
JOS.15.10	and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim (also called Chesalon) on the north, and went down to Beth Shemesh, and passed along by Timnah; 
JOS.15.11	and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along to Mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea. 
JOS.15.12	The west border was to the shore of the great sea. This is the border of the children of Judah according to their families.
JOS.15.13	He gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion amongst the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the 
JOS.15.14	Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. 
JOS.15.15	He went up against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher. 
JOS.15.16	Caleb said, “He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it, to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife.” 
JOS.15.17	Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife. 
JOS.15.18	When she came, she had him ask her father for a field. She got off her donkey, and Caleb said, “What do you want?”
JOS.15.19	She said, “Give me a blessing. Because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.”
JOS.15.19	So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
JOS.15.20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families. 
JOS.15.21	The farthest cities of the tribe of the children of Judah towards the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 
JOS.15.22	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 
JOS.15.23	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, 
JOS.15.24	Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, 
JOS.15.25	Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (also called Hazor), 
JOS.15.26	Amam, Shema, Moladah,

JOS.15.28	Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah, 
JOS.15.29	Baalah, Iim, Ezem, 
JOS.15.30	Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah, 
JOS.15.31	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 
JOS.15.32	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon. All the cities are twenty-nine, with their villages.
JOS.15.33	In the lowland, Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, 
JOS.15.34	Zanoah, En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam, 
JOS.15.35	Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,

JOS.15.44	Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.
JOS.15.45	Ekron, with its towns and its villages; 
JOS.15.46	from Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages. 
JOS.15.47	Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; to the brook of Egypt, and the great sea with its coastline.
JOS.15.48	In the hill country, Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, 
JOS.15.49	Dannah, Kiriath Sannah (which is Debir), 
JOS.15.50	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, 
JOS.15.51	Goshen, Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
JOS.15.52	Arab, Dumah, Eshan, 
JOS.15.53	Janim, Beth Tappuah, Aphekah, 
JOS.15.54	Humtah, Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.
JOS.15.55	Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Jutah, 
JOS.15.56	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,

JOS.15.58	Halhul, Beth Zur, Gedor, 
JOS.15.59	Maarath, Beth Anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages. 
JOS.15.60	Kiriath Baal (also called Kiriath Jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.
JOS.15.61	In the wilderness, Beth Arabah, Middin, Secacah, 
JOS.15.62	Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities with their villages.
JOS.15.63	As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah couldn’t drive them out; but the Jebusites live with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
JOS.16.1	The lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel. 
JOS.16.2	It went out from Bethel to Luz, and passed along to the border of the Archites to Ataroth; 
JOS.16.3	and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, to the border of Beth Horon the lower, and on to Gezer; and ended at the sea.
JOS.16.4	The children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance. 
JOS.16.5	This was the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families. The border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Horon the upper. 
JOS.16.6	The border went out westward at Michmethath on the north. The border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah. 
JOS.16.7	It went down from Janoah to Ataroth, to Naarah, reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan. 
JOS.16.8	From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families; 
JOS.16.9	together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the middle of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. 
JOS.16.10	They didn’t drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell in the territory of Ephraim to this day, and have become servants to do forced labour.
JOS.17.1	This was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. 
JOS.17.2	So this was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, for the children of Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the children of Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida. These were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families. 
JOS.17.3	But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
JOS.17.4	They came to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the princes, saying, “The 
JOS.17.5	Ten parts fell to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan; 
JOS.17.6	because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance amongst his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh. 
JOS.17.7	The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem. The border went along to the right hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim. 
JOS.17.9	The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook. These cities belonged to Ephraim amongst the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and ended at the sea. 
JOS.17.10	Southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border. They reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east. 
JOS.17.11	Manasseh had three heights in Issachar, in Asher Beth Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns. 
JOS.17.12	Yet the children of Manasseh couldn’t drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
JOS.17.13	When the children of Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labour, and didn’t utterly drive them out. 
JOS.17.14	The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance, since we are a numerous people, because the 
JOS.17.15	Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest, and clear land for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.”
JOS.17.16	The children of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us. All the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.”
JOS.17.17	Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, that is, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, “You are a numerous people, and have great power. You shall not have one lot only; 
JOS.17.18	but the hill country shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it’s farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.”
JOS.18.1	The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The land was subdued before them. 
JOS.18.2	Seven tribes remained amongst the children of Israel, which had not yet divided their inheritance. 
JOS.18.3	Joshua said to the children of Israel, “How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land, which the 
JOS.18.4	Appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe. I will send them, and they shall arise, walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; then they shall come to me. 
JOS.18.5	They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall live in his borders on the south, and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north. 
JOS.18.6	You shall survey the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots for you here before the 
JOS.18.7	However, the Levites have no portion amongst you; for the priesthood of the 
JOS.18.8	The men arose and went. Joshua commanded those who went to survey the land, saying, “Go walk through the land, survey it, and come again to me. I will cast lots for you here before the 
JOS.18.9	The men went and passed through the land, and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book. They came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the 
JOS.18.11	The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families. The border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 
JOS.18.12	Their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan. The border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward. It ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven. 
JOS.18.13	The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz (also called Bethel), southward. The border went down to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Horon the lower. 
JOS.18.14	The border extended, and turned around on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward; and ended at Kiriath Baal (also called Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah. This was the west quarter. 
JOS.18.15	The south quarter was from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim. The border went out westward, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. 
JOS.18.16	The border went down to the farthest part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward. It went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En Rogel. 
JOS.18.17	It extended northward, went out at En Shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim. It went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 
JOS.18.18	It passed along to the side opposite the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah. 
JOS.18.19	The border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the south border. 
JOS.18.20	The Jordan was its border on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders around it, according to their families. 
JOS.18.21	Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, 
JOS.18.22	Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
JOS.18.23	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
JOS.18.24	Chephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages. 
JOS.18.25	Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 
JOS.18.26	Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, 
JOS.18.27	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
JOS.18.28	Zelah, Eleph, the Jebusite (also called Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
JOS.19.1	The second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families. Their inheritance was in the middle of the inheritance of the children of Judah. 
JOS.19.2	They had for their inheritance Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah, 
JOS.19.3	Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem, 
JOS.19.4	Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
JOS.19.5	Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah,

JOS.19.9	Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them. Therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the middle of their inheritance.

JOS.19.34	The border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out from there to Hukkok. It reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan towards the sunrise.

JOS.19.48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
JOS.19.49	So they finished distributing the land for inheritance by its borders. The children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun amongst them. 
JOS.19.50	According to the 
JOS.19.51	These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the 
JOS.20.1	The 
JOS.20.2	“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Assign the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses, 
JOS.20.3	that the man slayer who kills any person accidentally or unintentionally may flee there. They shall be to you for a refuge from the avenger of blood. 
JOS.20.4	He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his case in the ears of the elders of that city. They shall take him into the city with them, and give him a place, that he may live amongst them. 
JOS.20.5	If the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver up the man slayer into his hand; because he struck his neighbour unintentionally, and didn’t hate him before. 
JOS.20.6	He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgement, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days. Then the man slayer shall return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city he fled from.’”
JOS.20.7	They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 
JOS.20.8	Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. 
JOS.20.9	These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the alien who lives amongst them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stands trial before the congregation.
JOS.21.1	Then the heads of fathers’ houses of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel. 
JOS.21.2	They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “The 
JOS.21.3	The children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of the 
JOS.21.4	The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. The children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had thirteen cities by lot out of the tribe of Judah, out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin.

JOS.21.9	They gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are mentioned by name: 
JOS.21.10	and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot. 
JOS.21.11	They gave them Kiriath Arba, named after the father of Anak (also called Hebron), in the hill country of Judah, with its pasture lands around it. 
JOS.21.12	But they gave the fields of the city and its villages to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

JOS.21.39	Heshbon with its pasture lands, Jazer with its pasture lands: four cities in all. 
JOS.21.40	All these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites. Their lot was twelve cities.
JOS.21.41	All the cities of the Levites amongst the possessions of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands. 
JOS.21.42	Each of these cities included their pasture lands around them. It was this way with all these cities.
JOS.21.43	So the 
JOS.21.44	The 
JOS.21.45	Nothing failed of any good thing which the 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
JOS.22.2	and said to them, “You have kept all that Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.3	You have not left your brothers these many days to this day, but have performed the duty of the commandment of the 
JOS.22.4	Now the 
JOS.22.5	Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the 
JOS.22.6	So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their tents. 
JOS.22.7	Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but Joshua gave to the other half amongst their brothers beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them, 
JOS.22.8	and spoke to them, saying, “Return with much wealth to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the plunder of your enemies with your brothers.”
JOS.22.9	The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they owned, according to the commandment of the 
JOS.22.10	When they came to the region near the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a great altar to look at. 
JOS.22.11	The children of Israel heard this, “Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar along the border of the land of Canaan, in the region around the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the children of Israel.” 
JOS.22.12	When the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war. 
JOS.22.13	The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest. 
JOS.22.14	With him were ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were each head of their fathers’ houses amongst the thousands of Israel. 
JOS.22.15	They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying, 
JOS.22.16	“The whole congregation of the 
JOS.22.17	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a plague on the congregation of the 
JOS.22.18	that you must turn away today from following the 
JOS.22.19	However, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession of the 
JOS.22.20	Didn’t Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? That man didn’t perish alone in his iniquity.’”
JOS.22.21	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel, 
JOS.22.22	“The Mighty One, God, the 
JOS.22.23	that we have built us an altar to turn away from following the 
JOS.22.24	“If we have not out of concern done this, and for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, “What have you to do with the 
JOS.22.25	For the 
JOS.22.26	“Therefore we said, ‘Let’s now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; 
JOS.22.27	but it will be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may perform the service of the 
JOS.22.28	“Therefore we said, ‘It shall be, when they tell us or our generations this in time to come, that we shall say, “Behold the pattern of the 
JOS.22.29	“Far be it from us that we should rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well. 
JOS.22.31	Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, “Today we know that the 
JOS.22.32	Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. 
JOS.22.33	The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad lived. 
JOS.22.34	The children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar “A Witness Between Us that the 
JOS.23.1	After many days, when the 
JOS.23.2	Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said to them, “I am old and well advanced in years. 
JOS.23.3	You have seen all that the 
JOS.23.4	Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea towards the going down of the sun. 
JOS.23.5	The 
JOS.23.6	“Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that you not turn away from it to the right hand or to the left; 
JOS.23.7	that you not come amongst these nations, these that remain amongst you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves to them; 
JOS.23.8	but hold fast to the 
JOS.23.9	“For the 
JOS.23.10	One man of you shall chase a thousand; for it is the 
JOS.23.11	Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love the 
JOS.23.12	“But if you do at all go back, and hold fast to the remnant of these nations, even these who remain amongst you, and make marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you; 
JOS.23.13	know for a certainty that the 
JOS.23.14	“Behold, today I am going the way of all the earth. You know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the 
JOS.23.15	It shall happen that as all the good things have come on you of which the 
JOS.23.16	when you disobey the covenant of the 
JOS.24.1	Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God. 
JOS.24.2	Joshua said to all the people, “The 
JOS.24.3	I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his offspring,
JOS.24.4	I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau Mount Seir, to possess it. Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
JOS.24.5	“‘I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did amongst them: and afterward I brought you out. 
JOS.24.6	I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and you came to the sea. The Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea. 
JOS.24.7	When they cried out to the 
JOS.24.8	“‘I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand. You possessed their land, and I destroyed them from before you. 
JOS.24.9	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you, 
JOS.24.10	but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still. So I delivered you out of his hand.
JOS.24.11	“‘You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand. 
JOS.24.12	I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword, nor with your bow. 
JOS.24.13	I gave you a land on which you had not laboured, and cities which you didn’t build, and you live in them. You eat of vineyards and olive groves which you didn’t plant.’
JOS.24.14	“Now therefore fear the 
JOS.24.15	If it seems evil to you to serve the 
JOS.24.16	The people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake the 
JOS.24.17	for it is the 
JOS.24.18	The 
JOS.24.19	Joshua said to the people, “You can’t serve the 
JOS.24.20	If you forsake the 
JOS.24.21	The people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve the 
JOS.24.22	Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the 
JOS.24.22	They said, “We are witnesses.”
JOS.24.23	“Now therefore put away the foreign gods which are amongst you, and incline your heart to the 
JOS.24.24	The people said to Joshua, “We will serve the 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 
JOS.24.26	Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the 
JOS.24.27	Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the 
JOS.24.28	So Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.
JOS.24.29	After these things, Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JOS.24.30	They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. 
JOS.24.31	Israel served the 
JOS.24.32	They buried the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver.
JOS.24.33	Eleazar the son of Aaron died. They buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
JDG.1.1	After the death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked of the 
JDG.1.2	The 
JDG.1.3	Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot.” So Simeon went with him. 
JDG.1.4	Judah went up, and the 
JDG.1.5	They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and they fought against him. They struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
JDG.1.6	But Adoni-Bezek fled. They pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. 
JDG.1.7	Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their big toes cut off, scavenged under my table. As I have done, so God
JDG.1.8	The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, took it, struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
JDG.1.9	After that, the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland. 
JDG.1.10	Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron. (The name of Hebron before that was Kiriath Arba.) They struck Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
JDG.1.11	From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir before that was Kiriath Sepher.) 
JDG.1.12	Caleb said, “I will give Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it.” 
JDG.1.13	Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it, so he gave him Achsah his daughter as his wife.
JDG.1.14	When she came, she got him to ask her father for a field. She got off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, “What would you like?”
JDG.1.15	She said to him, “Give me a blessing; because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.” Then Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. 
JDG.1.16	The children of the Kenite, Moses’ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people. 
JDG.1.17	Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah. 
JDG.1.18	Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border. 
JDG.1.19	The 
JDG.1.20	They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove the three sons of Anak out of there. 
JDG.1.21	The children of Benjamin didn’t drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
JDG.1.22	The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the 
JDG.1.23	The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city before that was Luz.) 
JDG.1.24	The watchers saw a man come out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.” 
JDG.1.25	He showed them the entrance into the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go. 
JDG.1.26	The man went into the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.
JDG.1.27	Manasseh didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. 
JDG.1.28	When Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labour, and didn’t utterly drive them out. 
JDG.1.29	Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, but the Canaanites lived in Gezer amongst them. 
JDG.1.30	Zebulun didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived amongst them, and became subject to forced labour. 
JDG.1.31	Asher didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob; 
JDG.1.32	but the Asherites lived amongst the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they didn’t drive them out. 
JDG.1.33	Naphtali didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived amongst the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labour. 
JDG.1.34	The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley; 
JDG.1.35	but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labour. 
JDG.1.36	The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
JDG.2.1	The 
JDG.2.2	You shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You shall break down their altars.’ But you have not listened to my voice. Why have you done this? 
JDG.2.3	Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’”
JDG.2.4	When the 
JDG.2.5	They called the name of that place Bochim,
JDG.2.6	Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel each went to his inheritance to possess the land. 
JDG.2.7	The people served the 
JDG.2.8	Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the 
JDG.2.9	They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. 
JDG.2.10	After all that generation were gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who didn’t know the 
JDG.2.11	The children of Israel did that which was evil in the 
JDG.2.12	They abandoned the 
JDG.2.13	They abandoned the 
JDG.2.14	The 
JDG.2.15	Wherever they went out, the 
JDG.2.16	The 
JDG.2.17	Yet they didn’t listen to their judges; for they prostituted themselves to other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They quickly turned away from the way in which their fathers walked, obeying the 
JDG.2.18	When the 
JDG.2.19	But when the judge was dead, they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down to them. They didn’t cease what they were doing, or give up their stubborn ways. 
JDG.2.20	The 
JDG.2.21	I also will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died from before them; 
JDG.2.22	that by them I may test Israel, to see if they will keep the 
JDG.2.23	So the 
JDG.3.1	Now these are the nations which the 
JDG.3.2	only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least those who knew nothing of it before: 
JDG.3.3	the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath. 
JDG.3.4	They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the 
JDG.3.5	The children of Israel lived amongst the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
JDG.3.6	They took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods. 
JDG.3.7	The children of Israel did that which was evil in the 
JDG.3.8	Therefore the 
JDG.3.9	When the children of Israel cried to the 
JDG.3.10	The 
JDG.3.11	The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the 
JDG.3.13	He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees. 
JDG.3.14	The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. 
JDG.3.15	But when the children of Israel cried to the 
JDG.3.16	Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit
JDG.3.17	He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. 
JDG.3.18	When Ehud had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute. 
JDG.3.19	But he himself turned back from the stone idols that were by Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.”
JDG.3.19	The king said, “Keep silence!” All who stood by him left him.
JDG.3.20	Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, “I have a message from God to you.” He arose out of his seat. 
JDG.3.21	Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body. 
JDG.3.22	The handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind. 
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.
JDG.3.24	After he had gone, his servants came and saw that the doors of the upper room were locked. They said, “Surely he is covering his feet
JDG.3.25	They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn’t open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor.
JDG.3.26	Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them.
JDG.3.28	He said to them, “Follow me; for the 
JDG.3.29	They struck at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man and every man of valour. No man escaped. 
JDG.3.30	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had rest eighty years.
JDG.3.31	After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved Israel.
JDG.4.1	The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the 
JDG.4.2	The 
JDG.4.3	The children of Israel cried to the 
JDG.4.4	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	She lived under Deborah’s palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgement. 
JDG.4.6	She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, “Hasn’t the 
JDG.4.7	I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.’”
JDG.4.8	Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”
JDG.4.9	She said, “I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the journey that you take won’t be for your honour; for the 
JDG.4.10	Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him. 
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh. 
JDG.4.12	They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor. 
JDG.4.13	Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.
JDG.4.14	Deborah said to Barak, “Go; for this is the day in which the 
JDG.4.15	The 
JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left.
JDG.4.17	However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
JDG.4.18	Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
JDG.4.19	He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.”
JDG.4.19	She opened a container of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him.
JDG.4.20	He said to her, “Stand in the door of the tent, and if any man comes and enquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’”
JDG.4.21	Then Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and died. 
JDG.4.22	Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples. 
JDG.4.23	So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day. 
JDG.4.24	The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
JDG.5.1	Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
JDG.5.2	“Because the leaders took the lead in Israel,
JDG.5.2	because the people offered themselves willingly,
JDG.5.2	be blessed, the 
JDG.5.3	“Hear, you kings!
JDG.5.3	Give ear, you princes!
JDG.5.3	I, even I, will sing to the 
JDG.5.3	I will sing praise to the 
JDG.5.4	“
JDG.5.4	when you marched out of the field of Edom,
JDG.5.4	the earth trembled, the sky also dropped.
JDG.5.4	Yes, the clouds dropped water.
JDG.5.5	The mountains quaked at the 
JDG.5.5	even Sinai at the presence of the 
JDG.5.6	“In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,
JDG.5.6	in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied.
JDG.5.6	The travellers walked through byways.
JDG.5.7	The rulers ceased in Israel.
JDG.5.7	They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;
JDG.5.7	Until I arose a mother in Israel.
JDG.5.8	They chose new gods.
JDG.5.8	Then war was in the gates.
JDG.5.8	Was there a shield or spear seen amongst forty thousand in Israel?
JDG.5.9	My heart is towards the governors of Israel,
JDG.5.9	who offered themselves willingly amongst the people.
JDG.5.9	Bless the 
JDG.5.10	“Speak, you who ride on white donkeys,
JDG.5.10	you who sit on rich carpets,
JDG.5.10	and you who walk by the way.
JDG.5.11	Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water,
JDG.5.11	there they will rehearse the 
JDG.5.11	the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.
JDG.5.11	“Then the 
JDG.5.12	‘Awake, awake, Deborah!
JDG.5.12	Awake, awake, utter a song!
JDG.5.12	Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.’
JDG.5.13	“Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down.
JDG.5.13	The 
JDG.5.14	Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim,
JDG.5.14	after you, Benjamin, amongst your peoples.
JDG.5.14	Governors come down out of Machir.
JDG.5.14	Those who handle the marshal’s staff came out of Zebulun.
JDG.5.15	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah.
JDG.5.15	As was Issachar, so was Barak.
JDG.5.15	They rushed into the valley at his feet.
JDG.5.15	By the watercourses of Reuben,
JDG.5.15	there were great resolves of heart.
JDG.5.16	Why did you sit amongst the sheepfolds?
JDG.5.16	To hear the whistling for the flocks?
JDG.5.16	At the watercourses of Reuben,
JDG.5.16	there were great searchings of heart.
JDG.5.17	Gilead lived beyond the Jordan.
JDG.5.17	Why did Dan remain in ships?
JDG.5.17	Asher sat still at the haven of the sea,
JDG.5.17	and lived by his creeks.
JDG.5.18	Zebulun was a people that jeopardised their lives to the death;
JDG.5.18	Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
JDG.5.19	“The kings came and fought,
JDG.5.19	then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.
JDG.5.19	They took no plunder of silver.
JDG.5.20	From the sky the stars fought.
JDG.5.20	From their courses, they fought against Sisera.
JDG.5.21	The river Kishon swept them away,
JDG.5.21	that ancient river, the river Kishon.
JDG.5.21	My soul, march on with strength.
JDG.5.22	Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancing,
JDG.5.22	the prancing of their strong ones.
JDG.5.23	‘Curse Meroz,’ said the 
JDG.5.23	‘Curse bitterly its inhabitants,
JDG.5.23	because they didn’t come to help the 
JDG.5.23	to help the 
JDG.5.24	“Jael shall be blessed above women,
JDG.5.24	the wife of Heber the Kenite;
JDG.5.24	blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
JDG.5.25	He asked for water.
JDG.5.25	She gave him milk.
JDG.5.25	She brought him butter in a lordly dish.
JDG.5.26	She put her hand to the tent peg,
JDG.5.26	and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer.
JDG.5.26	With the hammer she struck Sisera.
JDG.5.26	She struck through his head.
JDG.5.26	Yes, she pierced and struck through his temples.
JDG.5.27	At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay.
JDG.5.27	At her feet he bowed, he fell.
JDG.5.27	Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
JDG.5.28	“Through the window she looked out, and cried:
JDG.5.28	Sisera’s mother looked through the lattice.
JDG.5.28	‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?
JDG.5.28	Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?’
JDG.5.29	Her wise ladies answered her,
JDG.5.29	Yes, she returned answer to herself,
JDG.5.30	‘Have they not found, have they not divided the plunder?
JDG.5.30	A lady, two ladies to every man;
JDG.5.30	to Sisera a plunder of dyed garments,
JDG.5.30	a plunder of dyed garments embroidered,
JDG.5.30	of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the plunder?’
JDG.5.31	“So let all your enemies perish, 
JDG.5.31	but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises in its strength.”
JDG.5.31	Then the land had rest forty years.
JDG.6.1	The children of Israel did that which was evil in the 
JDG.6.2	The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made themselves the dens which are in the mountains, the caves, and the strongholds. 
JDG.6.3	So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the children of the east came up against them. 
JDG.6.4	They encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, until you come to Gaza. They left no sustenance in Israel, and no sheep, ox, or donkey. 
JDG.6.5	For they came up with their livestock and their tents. They came in as locusts for multitude. Both they and their camels were without number; and they came into the land to destroy it. 
JDG.6.6	Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to the 
JDG.6.7	When the children of Israel cried to the 
JDG.6.8	The 
JDG.6.9	I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land. 
JDG.6.10	I said to you, “I am the 
JDG.6.11	The 
JDG.6.12	The 
JDG.6.13	Gideon said to him, “Oh, my lord, if the 
JDG.6.14	The 
JDG.6.15	He said to him, “O Lord,
JDG.6.16	The 
JDG.6.17	He said to him, “If now I have found favour in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me. 
JDG.6.18	Please don’t go away until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before you.”
JDG.6.18	He said, “I will wait until you come back.”
JDG.6.19	Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes of an ephah
JDG.6.20	The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.”
JDG.6.20	He did so. 
JDG.6.21	Then the 
JDG.6.22	Gideon saw that he was the 
JDG.6.23	The 
JDG.6.24	Then Gideon built an altar there to the 
JDG.6.25	That same night, the 
JDG.6.26	Then build an altar to the 
JDG.6.27	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the 
JDG.6.28	When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built. 
JDG.6.29	They said to one another, “Who has done this thing?”
JDG.6.29	When they enquired and asked, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.”
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.” 
JDG.6.31	Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? He who will contend for him, let him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has broken down his altar!” 
JDG.6.32	Therefore on that day he named him Jerub-Baal,
JDG.6.33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel. 
JDG.6.34	But the 
JDG.6.35	He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they also were gathered together to follow him. He sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
JDG.6.36	Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken, 
JDG.6.37	behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I’ll know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken.”
JDG.6.38	It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
JDG.6.39	Gideon said to God, “Don’t let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.”
JDG.6.40	God did so that night; for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
JDG.7.1	Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early and encamped beside the spring of Harod. Midian’s camp was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley. 
JDG.7.2	The 
JDG.7.3	Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.
JDG.7.4	The 
JDG.7.5	So he brought down the people to the water; and the 
JDG.7.6	The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water. 
JDG.7.7	The 
JDG.7.8	So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of the men of Israel to their own tents, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley. 
JDG.7.9	That same night, the 
JDG.7.10	But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp. 
JDG.7.11	You will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp.” Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.
JDG.7.12	The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude.
JDG.7.13	When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow. He said, “Behold, I dreamt a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.”
JDG.7.14	His fellow answered, “This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has delivered Midian into his hand, with all the army.”
JDG.7.15	It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshipped. Then he returned into the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the 
JDG.7.16	He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all them trumpets and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.
JDG.7.17	He said to them, “Watch me, and do likewise. Behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so you shall do. 
JDG.7.18	When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, ‘For the 
JDG.7.19	So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch. Then they blew the trumpets and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands. 
JDG.7.20	The three companies blew the trumpets, broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they shouted, “The sword of the 
JDG.7.21	They each stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight. 
JDG.7.22	They blew the three hundred trumpets, and the 
JDG.7.23	The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued Midian. 
JDG.7.24	Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian and take the waters before them as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan!” So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together and took the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan. 
JDG.7.25	They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at Oreb’s rock, and Zeeb they killed at Zeeb’s wine press, as they pursued Midian. Then they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
JDG.8.1	The men of Ephraim said to him, “Why have you treated us this way, that you didn’t call us when you went to fight with Midian?” They rebuked him sharply. 
JDG.8.2	He said to them, “What have I now done in comparison with you? Isn’t the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? 
JDG.8.3	God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb! What was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger was abated towards him when he had said that.
JDG.8.4	Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing. 
JDG.8.5	He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
JDG.8.6	The princes of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?”
JDG.8.7	Gideon said, “Therefore when the 
JDG.8.8	He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. 
JDG.8.9	He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.”
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew sword. 
JDG.8.11	Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army; for the army felt secure. 
JDG.8.12	Zebah and Zalmunna fled and he pursued them. He took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and confused all the army. 
JDG.8.13	Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres. 
JDG.8.14	He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him; and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, seventy-seven men. 
JDG.8.15	He came to the men of Succoth, and said, “See Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?’” 
JDG.8.16	He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. 
JDG.8.17	He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.
JDG.8.18	Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?”
JDG.8.18	They answered, “They were like you. They all resembled the children of a king.”
JDG.8.19	He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the 
JDG.8.20	He said to Jether his firstborn, “Get up and kill them!” But the youth didn’t draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “You rise and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’ necks.
JDG.8.22	Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you, your son, and your son’s son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.”
JDG.8.23	Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. The 
JDG.8.24	Gideon said to them, “I do have a request: that you would each give me the earrings of his plunder.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
JDG.8.25	They answered, “We will willingly give them.” They spread a garment, and every man threw the earrings of his plunder into it. 
JDG.8.26	The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred shekels
JDG.8.27	Gideon made an ephod out of it, and put it in Ophrah, his city. Then all Israel played the prostitute with it there; and it became a snare to Gideon and to his house. 
JDG.8.28	So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. The land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
JDG.8.29	Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house. 
JDG.8.30	Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body, for he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech. 
JDG.8.32	Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
JDG.8.33	As soon as Gideon was dead, the children of Israel turned again and played the prostitute following the Baals, and made Baal Berith their god. 
JDG.8.34	The children of Israel didn’t remember the 
JDG.8.35	neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.
JDG.9.1	Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s brothers, and spoke with them and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying, 
JDG.9.2	“Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, ‘Is it better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.”
JDG.9.3	His mother’s brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words. Their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, “He is our brother.” 
JDG.9.4	They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and reckless fellows who followed him. 
JDG.9.5	He went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself. 
JDG.9.6	All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together with all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem. 
JDG.9.7	When they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim and lifted up his voice, cried out, and said to them, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you. 
JDG.9.8	The trees set out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’
JDG.9.9	“But the olive tree said to them, ‘Should I stop producing my oil, with which they honour God and man by me, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’
JDG.9.10	“The trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and reign over us.’
JDG.9.11	“But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’
JDG.9.12	“The trees said to the vine, ‘Come and reign over us.’
JDG.9.13	“The vine said to them, ‘Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’
JDG.9.14	“Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘Come and reign over us.’
JDG.9.15	“The bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’
JDG.9.16	“Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands 
JDG.9.17	(for my father fought for you, risked his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian; 
JDG.9.18	and you have risen up against my father’s house today and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother); 
JDG.9.19	if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house today, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you; 
JDG.9.20	but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from the house of Millo and devour Abimelech.”
JDG.9.21	Jotham ran away and fled, and went to Beer
JDG.9.22	Abimelech was prince over Israel three years. 
JDG.9.23	Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, 
JDG.9.24	that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother who killed them, and on the men of Shechem who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers. 
JDG.9.25	The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them; and Abimelech was told about it.
JDG.9.26	Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him. 
JDG.9.27	They went out into the field, harvested their vineyards, trod the grapes, celebrated, and went into the house of their god and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. 
JDG.9.28	Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn’t he the son of Jerubbaal? Isn’t Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem, but why should we serve him? 
JDG.9.29	I wish that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech.” He said to Abimelech, “Increase your army and come out!”
JDG.9.30	When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burnt. 
JDG.9.31	He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and behold, they incite the city against you. 
JDG.9.32	Now therefore, go up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field. 
JDG.9.33	It shall be that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early and rush on the city. Behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.”
JDG.9.34	Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. 
JDG.9.35	Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. Abimelech rose up, and the people who were with him, from the ambush.
JDG.9.36	When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains.”
JDG.9.36	Zebul said to him, “You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.”
JDG.9.37	Gaal spoke again and said, “Behold, people are coming down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim.”
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul said to him, “Now where is your mouth, that you said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you have despised? Please go out now and fight with them.”
JDG.9.39	Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded, even to the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.9.41	Abimelech lived at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem. 
JDG.9.42	On the next day, the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech. 
JDG.9.43	He took the people and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came out of the city. So, he rose up against them and struck them. 
JDG.9.44	Abimelech and the companies that were with him rushed forward and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field and struck them. 
JDG.9.45	Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city and killed the people in it. He beat down the city and sowed it with salt.
JDG.9.46	When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith. 
JDG.9.47	Abimelech was told that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 
JDG.9.48	Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done!” 
JDG.9.49	All the people likewise each cut down his bough, followed Abimelech, and put them at the base of the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women. 
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez, and took it. 
JDG.9.51	But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women of the city fled there, and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
JDG.9.53	A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, and broke his skull.
JDG.9.54	Then he called hastily to the young man, his armour bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, that men not say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ His young man thrust him through, and he died.”
JDG.9.55	When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they each departed to his place. 
JDG.9.56	Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father in killing his seventy brothers; 
JDG.9.57	and God repaid all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads; and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came on them.
JDG.10.1	After Abimelech, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	After him Jair, the Gileadite, arose. He judged Israel twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts. They had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead. 
JDG.10.5	Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
JDG.10.6	The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the 
JDG.10.7	The 
JDG.10.8	They troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. 
JDG.10.9	The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was very distressed. 
JDG.10.10	The children of Israel cried to the 
JDG.10.11	The 
JDG.10.12	The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand. 
JDG.10.13	Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods. Therefore I will save you no more. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress!”
JDG.10.15	The children of Israel said to the 
JDG.10.16	They put away the foreign gods from amongst them and served the 
JDG.10.17	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead. The children of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in Mizpah. 
JDG.10.18	The people, the princes of Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
JDG.11.1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour. He was the son of a prostitute. Gilead became the father of Jephthah. 
JDG.11.2	Gilead’s wife bore him sons. When his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You will not inherit in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.” 
JDG.11.3	Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Outlaws joined up with Jephthah, and they went out with him.
JDG.11.4	After a while, the children of Ammon made war against Israel. 
JDG.11.5	When the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob. 
JDG.11.6	They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.”
JDG.11.7	Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?”
JDG.11.8	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us and fight with the children of Ammon. You will be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
JDG.11.9	Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and the 
JDG.11.10	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The 
JDG.11.11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them. Jephthah spoke all his words before the 
JDG.11.12	Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, “What do you have to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?”
JDG.11.13	The king of the children of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore restore that territory again peaceably.”
JDG.11.14	Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon; 
JDG.11.15	and he said to him, “Jephthah says: Israel didn’t take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon; 
JDG.11.16	but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh, 
JDG.11.17	then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let me pass through your land;’ but the king of Edom didn’t listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab, but he refused; so Israel stayed in Kadesh. 
JDG.11.18	Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn’t come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. 
JDG.11.19	Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, ‘Please let us pass through your land to my place.’ 
JDG.11.20	But Sihon didn’t trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
JDG.11.21	The 
JDG.11.22	They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan. 
JDG.11.23	So now the 
JDG.11.24	Won’t you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever the 
JDG.11.25	Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? 
JDG.11.26	Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along the side of the Arnon for three hundred years! Why didn’t you recover them within that time? 
JDG.11.27	Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. May The 
JDG.11.28	However, the king of the children of Ammon didn’t listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him. 
JDG.11.29	Then the 
JDG.11.30	Jephthah vowed a vow to the 
JDG.11.31	then it shall be, that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the 
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the 
JDG.11.33	He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
JDG.11.34	Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. She was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter. 
JDG.11.35	When he saw her, he tore his clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to the 
JDG.11.36	She said to him, “My father, you have opened your mouth to the 
JDG.11.37	Then she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me. Leave me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.”
JDG.11.38	He said, “Go.” He sent her away for two months; and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her virginity on the mountains. 
JDG.11.39	At the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed. She was a virgin. It became a custom in Israel 
JDG.11.40	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
JDG.12.1	The men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah, “Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didn’t call us to go with you? We will burn your house around you with fire!”
JDG.12.2	Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn’t save me out of their hand. 
JDG.12.3	When I saw that you didn’t save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the 
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim. The men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the middle of Ephraim, and in the middle of Manasseh.” 
JDG.12.5	The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. Whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said, “Let me go over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No;” 
JDG.12.6	then they said to him, “Now say ‘Shibboleth;’” and he said “Sibboleth”; for he couldn’t manage to pronounce it correctly, then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time, forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell.
JDG.12.7	Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in the cities of Gilead.
JDG.12.8	After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
JDG.12.9	He had thirty sons. He sent his thirty daughters outside his clan, and he brought in thirty daughters from outside his clan for his sons. He judged Israel seven years. 
JDG.12.10	Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. 
JDG.12.12	Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty sons’ sons who rode on seventy donkey colts. He judged Israel eight years. 
JDG.12.15	Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the 
JDG.13.2	There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and childless. 
JDG.13.3	The 
JDG.13.4	Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and don’t eat any unclean thing; 
JDG.13.5	for, behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son. No razor shall come on his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. He shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.”
JDG.13.6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome. I didn’t ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name; 
JDG.13.7	but he said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink. Don’t eat any unclean thing, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.’”
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah entreated the 
JDG.13.9	God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah, her husband, wasn’t with her. 
JDG.13.10	The woman hurried and ran, and told her husband, saying to him, “Behold, the man who came to me that day has appeared to me,”
JDG.13.11	Manoah arose and followed his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?”
JDG.13.11	He said, “I am.”
JDG.13.12	Manoah said, “Now let your words happen. What shall the child’s way of life and mission be?”
JDG.13.13	The 
JDG.13.14	She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. Let her observe all that I commanded her.”
JDG.13.15	Manoah said to the 
JDG.13.16	The 
JDG.13.17	Manoah said to the 
JDG.13.18	The 
JDG.13.19	So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to the 
JDG.13.20	For when the flame went up towards the sky from off the altar, the 
JDG.13.21	But the 
JDG.13.22	Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, because we have seen God.”
JDG.13.23	But his wife said to him, “If the 
JDG.13.24	The woman bore a son and named him Samson. The child grew, and the 
JDG.13.25	The 
JDG.14.1	Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. 
JDG.14.2	He came up, and told his father and his mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore get her for me as my wife.”
JDG.14.3	Then his father and his mother said to him, “Isn’t there a woman amongst your brothers’ daughters, or amongst all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?”
JDG.14.3	Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she pleases me well.”
JDG.14.4	But his father and his mother didn’t know that it was of the 
JDG.14.5	Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and his mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion roared at him. 
JDG.14.6	The 
JDG.14.7	He went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well. 
JDG.14.8	After a while he returned to take her, and he went over to see the carcass of the lion; and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. 
JDG.14.9	He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went. He came to his father and mother and gave to them, and they ate, but he didn’t tell them that he had taken the honey out of the lion’s body. 
JDG.14.10	His father went down to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men used to do so. 
JDG.14.11	When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.
JDG.14.12	Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle now. If you can tell me the answer within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing; 
JDG.14.13	but if you can’t tell me the answer, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.”
JDG.14.13	They said to him, “Tell us your riddle, that we may hear it.”
JDG.14.14	He said to them,
JDG.14.14	“Out of the eater came out food.
JDG.14.14	Out of the strong came out sweetness.”
JDG.14.14	They couldn’t in three days declare the riddle. 
JDG.14.15	On the seventh day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Isn’t that so?”
JDG.14.16	Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, “You just hate me, and don’t love me. You’ve told a riddle to the children of my people, and haven’t told it to me.”
JDG.14.16	He said to her, “Behold, I haven’t told my father or my mother, so why should I tell you?”
JDG.14.17	She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and on the seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told the riddle to the children of her people. 
JDG.14.18	The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?”
JDG.14.18	He said to them,
JDG.14.18	“If you hadn’t ploughed with my heifer,
JDG.14.18	you wouldn’t have found out my riddle.”
JDG.14.19	The 
JDG.14.20	But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his friend.
JDG.15.1	But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat. He said, “I will go in to my wife’s room.”
JDG.15.1	But her father wouldn’t allow him to go in. 
JDG.15.2	Her father said, “I most certainly thought that you utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please, take her instead.”
JDG.15.3	Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in the case of the Philistines when I harm them.” 
JDG.15.4	Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the middle between every two tails. 
JDG.15.5	When he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?”
JDG.15.6	They said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” The Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
JDG.15.7	Samson said to them, “If you behave like this, surely I will take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.” 
JDG.15.8	He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cave in Etam’s rock. 
JDG.15.9	Then the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
JDG.15.10	The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?”
JDG.15.10	They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.”
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cave in Etam’s rock, and said to Samson, “Don’t you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?”
JDG.15.11	He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”
JDG.15.12	They said to him, “We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.”
JDG.15.12	Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.”
JDG.15.13	They spoke to him, saying, “No, but we will bind you securely and deliver you into their hands; but surely we will not kill you.” They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
JDG.15.14	When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. Then the 
JDG.15.15	He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, put out his hand, took it, and struck a thousand men with it. 
JDG.15.16	Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men.” 
JDG.15.17	When he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.
JDG.15.18	He was very thirsty, and called on the 
JDG.15.19	But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day. 
JDG.15.20	He judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
JDG.16.1	Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a prostitute, and went in to her. 
JDG.16.2	The Gazites were told, “Samson is here!” They surrounded him and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, “Wait until morning light; then we will kill him.” 
JDG.16.3	Samson lay until midnight, then arose at midnight and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city, with the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.
JDG.16.4	It came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
JDG.16.5	The lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, “Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”
JDG.16.6	Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and what you might be bound to afflict you.”
JDG.16.7	Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.”
JDG.16.8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. 
JDG.16.9	Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner room. She said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He broke the cords as a flax thread is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.
JDG.16.10	Delilah said to Samson, “Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies. Now please tell me how you might be bound.”
JDG.16.11	He said to her, “If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.”
JDG.16.12	So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, then said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” The ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them off his arms like a thread.
JDG.16.13	Delilah said to Samson, “Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you might be bound.”
JDG.16.13	He said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the fabric on the loom.”
JDG.16.14	She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam and the fabric.
JDG.16.15	She said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies.”
JDG.16.16	When she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, his soul was troubled to death. 
JDG.16.17	He told her all his heart and said to her, “No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me and I will become weak, and be like any other man.”
JDG.16.18	When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand. 
JDG.16.19	She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. 
JDG.16.20	She said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!”
JDG.16.20	He awoke out of his sleep, and said, “I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free.” But he didn’t know that the 
JDG.16.21	The Philistines laid hold on him and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with fetters of bronze; and he ground at the mill in the prison. 
JDG.16.22	However, the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.
JDG.16.23	The lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.” 
JDG.16.24	When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, “Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand.”
JDG.16.25	When their hearts were merry, they said, “Call for Samson, that he may entertain us.” They called for Samson out of the prison; and he performed before them. They set him between the pillars; 
JDG.16.26	and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, “Allow me to feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean on them.” 
JDG.16.27	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson performed. 
JDG.16.28	Samson called to the 
JDG.16.29	Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested and leaned on them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left. 
JDG.16.30	Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his life.
JDG.16.31	Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father. He judged Israel twenty years.
JDG.17.1	There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. 
JDG.17.2	He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears—behold, the silver is with me. I took it.”
JDG.17.2	His mother said, “May the 
JDG.17.3	He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, then his mother said, “I most certainly dedicate the silver to the 
JDG.17.4	When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, who made a carved image and a molten image out of it. It was in the house of Micah.
JDG.17.5	The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim,
JDG.17.6	In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes. 
JDG.17.7	There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there. 
JDG.17.8	The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he travelled. 
JDG.17.9	Micah said to him, “Where did you come from?”
JDG.17.9	He said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking for a place to live.”
JDG.17.10	Micah said to him, “Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food.” So the Levite went in. 
JDG.17.11	The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons. 
JDG.17.12	Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 
JDG.17.13	Then Micah said, “Now I know that the 
JDG.18.1	In those days there was no king in Israel. In those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance had not fallen to them amongst the tribes of Israel. 
JDG.18.2	The children of Dan sent five men of their family from their whole number, men of valour, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it. They said to them, “Go, explore the land!”
JDG.18.2	They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. 
JDG.18.3	When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; so they went over there and said to him, “Who brought you here? What do you do in this place? What do you have here?”
JDG.18.4	He said to them, “Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I have become his priest.”
JDG.18.5	They said to him, “Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.”
JDG.18.6	The priest said to them, “Go in peace. Your way in which you go is before the 
JDG.18.7	Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, how they lived in safety, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no one in the land possessing authority, that might put them to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone else. 
JDG.18.8	They came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brothers asked them, “What do you say?”
JDG.18.9	They said, “Arise, and let’s go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Do you stand still? Don’t be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land. 
JDG.18.10	When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.”
JDG.18.11	The family of the Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol with six hundred men armed with weapons of war. 
JDG.18.12	They went up and encamped in Kiriath Jearim in Judah. Therefore they call that place Mahaneh Dan to this day. Behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim. 
JDG.18.13	They passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
JDG.18.14	Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brothers, “Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim,
JDG.18.15	They went over there and came to the house of the young Levite man, even to the house of Micah, and asked him how he was doing. 
JDG.18.16	The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate. 
JDG.18.17	The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.
JDG.18.18	When these went into Micah’s house, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
JDG.18.19	They said to him, “Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us. Be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”
JDG.18.20	The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went with the people. 
JDG.18.21	So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods before them. 
JDG.18.22	When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan. 
JDG.18.23	As they called to the children of Dan, they turned their faces, and said to Micah, “What ails you, that you come with such a company?”
JDG.18.24	He said, “You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away! What more do I have? How can you ask me, ‘What ails you?’”
JDG.18.25	The children of Dan said to him, “Don’t let your voice be heard amongst us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.”
JDG.18.26	The children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house. 
JDG.18.27	They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; then they burnt the city with fire. 
JDG.18.28	There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city and lived in it. 
JDG.18.29	They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; however the name of the city used to be Laish. 
JDG.18.30	The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land. 
JDG.18.31	So they set up for themselves Micah’s engraved image which he made, and it remained all the time that God’s house was in Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	In those days, when there was no king in Israel, there was a certain Levite living on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took for himself a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah. 
JDG.19.2	His concubine played the prostitute against him, and went away from him to her father’s house to Bethlehem Judah, and was there for four months. 
JDG.19.3	Her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him and a couple of donkeys. She brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. 
JDG.19.4	His father-in-law, the young lady’s father, kept him there; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank, and stayed there.
JDG.19.5	On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning, and he rose up to depart. The young lady’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.” 
JDG.19.6	So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together. Then the young lady’s father said to the man, “Please be pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.” 
JDG.19.7	The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he stayed there again. 
JDG.19.8	He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady’s father said, “Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines;” and they both ate.
JDG.19.9	When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady’s father, said to him, “Behold, now the day draws towards evening, please stay all night. Behold, the day is ending. Stay here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go on your way early, that you may go home.” 
JDG.19.10	But the man wouldn’t stay that night, but he rose up and went near Jebus (also called Jerusalem). With him were a couple of saddled donkeys. His concubine also was with him.
JDG.19.11	When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, “Please come and let’s enter into this city of the Jebusites, and stay in it.”
JDG.19.12	His master said to him, “We won’t enter into the city of a foreigner that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.” 
JDG.19.13	He said to his servant, “Come and let’s draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.” 
JDG.19.14	So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	They went over there, to go in to stay in Gibeah. He went in, and sat down in the street of the city; for there was no one who took them into his house to stay.
JDG.19.16	Behold, an old man came from his work out of the field at evening. Now the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he lived in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites. 
JDG.19.17	He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”
JDG.19.18	He said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem Judah. I am going to the 
JDG.19.19	Yet there is both straw and feed for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your servant, and for the young man who is with your servants. There is no lack of anything.”
JDG.19.20	The old man said, “Peace be to you! Just let me supply all your needs, but don’t sleep in the street.” 
JDG.19.21	So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder. Then they washed their feet, and ate and drank. 
JDG.19.22	As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain wicked fellows, surrounded the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came into your house, that we can have sex with him!”
JDG.19.23	The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, “No, my brothers, please don’t act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, don’t do this folly. 
JDG.19.24	Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them what seems good to you; but to this man don’t do any such folly.”
JDG.19.25	But the men wouldn’t listen to him; so the man grabbed his concubine, and brought her out to them; and they had sex with her, and abused her all night until the morning. When the day began to dawn, they let her go. 
JDG.19.26	Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord was, until it was light. 
JDG.19.27	Her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
JDG.19.28	He said to her, “Get up, and let’s get going!” but no one answered. Then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.
JDG.19.29	When he had come into his house, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	It was so, that all who saw it said, “Such a deed has not been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day! Consider it, take counsel, and speak.”
JDG.20.1	Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the 
JDG.20.2	The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword. 
JDG.20.3	(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel said, “Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?”
JDG.20.4	The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, “I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night. 
JDG.20.5	The men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house by night. They intended to kill me and they raped my concubine, and she is dead. 
JDG.20.6	I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.”
JDG.20.8	All the people arose as one man, saying, “None of us will go to his tent, neither will any of us turn to his house. 
JDG.20.9	But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot; 
JDG.20.10	and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that the men of Gibeah have done in Israel.” 
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
JDG.20.12	The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What wickedness is this that has happened amongst you? 
JDG.20.13	Now therefore deliver up the men, the wicked fellows who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel.”
JDG.20.13	But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the children of Israel. 
JDG.20.14	The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel. 
JDG.20.15	The children of Benjamin were counted on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, in addition to the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were counted seven hundred chosen men. 
JDG.20.16	Amongst all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. 
JDG.20.17	The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were counted four hundred thousand men who drew sword. All these were men of war.
JDG.20.18	The children of Israel arose, went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God. They asked, “Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?”
JDG.20.18	The 
JDG.20.19	The children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	The children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day destroyed twenty-two thousand of the Israelite men down to the ground. 
JDG.20.22	The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day. 
JDG.20.23	The children of Israel went up and wept before the 
JDG.20.23	The 
JDG.20.24	The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. 
JDG.20.25	Benjamin went out against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men. All these drew the sword.
JDG.20.26	Then all the children of Israel and all the people went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before the 
JDG.20.27	The children of Israel asked the 
JDG.20.28	and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?”
JDG.20.28	The 
JDG.20.29	Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah. 
JDG.20.30	The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. 
JDG.20.31	The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
JDG.20.32	The children of Benjamin said, “They are struck down before us, as at the first.” But the children of Israel said, “Let’s flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.”
JDG.20.33	All the men of Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar. Then the ambushers of Israel broke out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba. 
JDG.20.34	Ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel came over against Gibeah, and the battle was severe; but they didn’t know that disaster was close to them. 
JDG.20.35	The 
JDG.20.36	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck, for the men of Israel yielded to Benjamin because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.37	The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; then the ambushers spread out, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword. 
JDG.20.38	Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city. 
JDG.20.39	The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, “Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.” 
JDG.20.40	But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole city went up in smoke to the sky. 
JDG.20.41	The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that disaster had come on them. 
JDG.20.42	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness, but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the middle of it. 
JDG.20.43	They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and trod them down at their resting place, as far as near Gibeah towards the sunrise. 
JDG.20.44	Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valour. 
JDG.20.45	They turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. They gleaned five thousand men of them in the highways, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck two thousand men of them. 
JDG.20.46	So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword. All these were men of valour. 
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months. 
JDG.20.48	The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword—including the entire city, the livestock, and all that they found. Moreover they set all the cities which they found on fire.
JDG.21.1	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, “None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.” 
JDG.21.2	The people came to Bethel and sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept severely. 
JDG.21.3	They said, “The 
JDG.21.4	On the next day, the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 
JDG.21.5	The children of Israel said, “Who is there amongst all the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up in the assembly to the 
JDG.21.6	The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, “There is one tribe cut off from Israel today. 
JDG.21.7	How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by the 
JDG.21.8	They said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up to the 
JDG.21.9	For when the people were counted, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there. 
JDG.21.10	The congregation sent twelve thousand of the most valiant men there, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. 
JDG.21.11	This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain with a man.” 
JDG.21.12	They found amongst the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
JDG.21.13	The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them. 
JDG.21.14	Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead. There still weren’t enough for them. 
JDG.21.15	The people grieved for Benjamin, because the 
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, “How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?” 
JDG.21.17	They said, “There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel. 
JDG.21.18	However, we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, ‘Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.’” 
JDG.21.19	They said, “Behold, there is a feast of the 
JDG.21.20	They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards, 
JDG.21.21	and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously to us, because we didn’t take for each man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them; otherwise you would now be guilty.’”
JDG.21.23	The children of Benjamin did so, and took wives for themselves according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them. 
JDG.21.24	The children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they each went out from there to his own inheritance. 
JDG.21.25	In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.
RUT.1.1	In the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land. A certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to live in the country of Moab with his wife and his two sons. 
RUT.1.2	The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi. The names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah. They came into the country of Moab and lived there. 
RUT.1.3	Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left with her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	They took for themselves wives of the women of Moab. The name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other was Ruth. They lived there about ten years. 
RUT.1.5	Mahlon and Chilion both died, and the woman was bereaved of her two children and of her husband. 
RUT.1.6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab; for she had heard in the country of Moab how the 
RUT.1.7	She went out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her. They went on the way to return to the land of Judah. 
RUT.1.8	Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to her mother’s house. May the 
RUT.1.9	May The 
RUT.1.9	Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices, and wept. 
RUT.1.10	They said to her, “No, but we will return with you to your people.”
RUT.1.11	Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why do you want to go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 
RUT.1.12	Go back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, ‘I have hope,’ if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons, 
RUT.1.13	would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me seriously for your sakes, for the 
RUT.1.14	They lifted up their voices and wept again; then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth stayed with her. 
RUT.1.15	She said, “Behold,
RUT.1.16	Ruth said, “Don’t urge me to leave you, and to return from following you, for where you go, I will go; and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God
RUT.1.17	Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May The 
RUT.1.18	When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
RUT.1.19	So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. When they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was excited about them, and they asked, “Is this Naomi?”
RUT.1.20	She said to them, “Don’t call me Naomi.
RUT.1.21	I went out full, and the 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab. They came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	Naomi had a relative of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz. 
RUT.2.2	Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean amongst the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favour.”
RUT.2.2	She said to her, “Go, my daughter.” 
RUT.2.3	She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
RUT.2.4	Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May The 
RUT.2.4	They answered him, “May The 
RUT.2.5	Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?”
RUT.2.6	The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab. 
RUT.2.7	She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers amongst the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.”
RUT.2.8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens. 
RUT.2.9	Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.”
RUT.2.10	Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favour in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?”
RUT.2.11	Boaz answered her, “I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before. 
RUT.2.12	May the 
RUT.2.13	Then she said, “Let me find favour in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.”
RUT.2.14	At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.”
RUT.2.14	She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it. 
RUT.2.15	When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even amongst the sheaves, and don’t reproach her. 
RUT.2.16	Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.”
RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah
RUT.2.18	She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough.
RUT.2.19	Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.”
RUT.2.19	She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.” 
RUT.2.20	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by the 
RUT.2.21	Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’”
RUT.2.22	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.” 
RUT.2.23	So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you? 
RUT.3.2	Now isn’t Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he will be winnowing barley tonight on the threshing floor. 
RUT.3.3	Therefore wash yourself, anoint yourself, get dressed, and go down to the threshing floor; but don’t make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall note the place where he is lying. Then you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lay down. Then he will tell you what to do.”
RUT.3.5	She said to her, “All that you say, I will do.” 
RUT.3.6	She went down to the threshing floor, and did everything that her mother-in-law told her. 
RUT.3.7	When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. She came softly, uncovered his feet, and laid down. 
RUT.3.8	At midnight, the man was startled and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet. 
RUT.3.9	He said, “Who are you?”
RUT.3.9	She answered, “I am Ruth your servant. Therefore spread the corner of your garment over your servant; for you are a near kinsman.”
RUT.3.10	He said, “You are blessed by the 
RUT.3.11	Now, my daughter, don’t be afraid. I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people knows that you are a worthy woman. 
RUT.3.12	Now it is true that I am a near kinsman. However, there is a kinsman nearer than I. 
RUT.3.13	Stay this night, and in the morning, if he will perform for you the part of a kinsman, good. Let him do the kinsman’s duty. But if he will not do the duty of a kinsman for you, then I will do the duty of a kinsman for you, as the 
RUT.3.14	She lay at his feet until the morning, then she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.” 
RUT.3.15	He said, “Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it.” She held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; then he went into the city.
RUT.3.16	When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did it go, my daughter?”
RUT.3.16	She told her all that the man had done for her. 
RUT.3.17	She said, “He gave me these six measures of barley; for he said, ‘Don’t go empty to your mother-in-law.’”
RUT.3.18	Then she said, “Wait, my daughter, until you know what will happen; for the man will not rest until he has settled this today.”
RUT.4.1	Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there. Behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by. Boaz said to him, “Come over here, friend, and sit down!” He came over, and sat down. 
RUT.4.2	Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here,” and they sat down. 
RUT.4.3	He said to the near kinsman, “Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s. 
RUT.4.4	I thought I should tell you, saying, ‘Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.’ If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.”
RUT.4.4	He said, “I will redeem it.”
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.”
RUT.4.6	The near kinsman said, “I can’t redeem it for myself, lest I endanger my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can’t redeem it.”
RUT.4.7	Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man took off his sandal, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was the way of formalizing transactions in Israel. 
RUT.4.8	So the near kinsman said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” then he took off his sandal.
RUT.4.9	Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses today, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi. 
RUT.4.10	Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from amongst his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses today.”
RUT.4.11	All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May the 
RUT.4.12	Let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the offspring
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the 
RUT.4.14	The women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the 
RUT.4.15	He shall be to you a restorer of life and sustain you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.” 
RUT.4.16	Naomi took the child, laid him in her bosom, and became nurse to him. 
RUT.4.17	The women, her neighbours, gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi”. They named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
RUT.4.18	Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron, 
RUT.4.19	and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab, 
RUT.4.20	and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon, 
RUT.4.21	and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed, 
RUT.4.22	and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.
1SA.1.1	Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
1SA.1.2	He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 
1SA.1.3	This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to the 
1SA.1.4	When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters; 
1SA.1.5	but he gave a double portion to Hannah, for he loved Hannah, but the 
1SA.1.6	Her rival provoked her severely, to irritate her, because the 
1SA.1.7	So year by year, when she went up to the 
1SA.1.8	Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”
1SA.1.9	So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the 
1SA.1.10	She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the 
1SA.1.11	She vowed a vow, and said, “The 
1SA.1.12	As she continued praying before the 
1SA.1.13	Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. 
1SA.1.14	Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your wine!”
1SA.1.15	Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the 
1SA.1.16	Don’t consider your servant a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation.”
1SA.1.17	Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; and may the God
1SA.1.18	She said, “Let your servant find favour in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate; and her facial expression wasn’t sad any more.
1SA.1.19	They rose up in the morning early and worshipped the 
1SA.1.20	When the time had come, Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel,
1SA.1.21	The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the 
1SA.1.22	But Hannah didn’t go up, for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before the 
1SA.1.23	Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the 
1SA.1.23	So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned him. 
1SA.1.24	When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah
1SA.1.25	They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli. 
1SA.1.26	She said, “Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to the 
1SA.1.27	I prayed for this child, and the 
1SA.1.28	Therefore I have also given him to the 
1SA.2.1	Hannah prayed, and said:
1SA.2.1	“My heart exults in the 
1SA.2.1	My horn is exalted in the 
1SA.2.1	My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,
1SA.2.1	because I rejoice in your salvation.
1SA.2.2	There is no one as holy as the 
1SA.2.2	for there is no one besides you,
1SA.2.2	nor is there any rock like our God.
1SA.2.3	“Don’t keep talking so exceedingly proudly.
1SA.2.3	Don’t let arrogance come out of your mouth,
1SA.2.3	for the 
1SA.2.3	By him actions are weighed.
1SA.2.4	“The bows of the mighty men are broken.
1SA.2.4	Those who stumbled are armed with strength.
1SA.2.5	Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread.
1SA.2.5	Those who were hungry are satisfied.
1SA.2.5	Yes, the barren has borne seven.
1SA.2.5	She who has many children languishes.
1SA.2.6	“The 
1SA.2.6	He brings down to Sheol
1SA.2.7	The 
1SA.2.7	He brings low, he also lifts up.
1SA.2.8	He raises up the poor out of the dust.
1SA.2.8	He lifts up the needy from the dunghill
1SA.2.8	to make them sit with princes
1SA.2.8	and inherit the throne of glory.
1SA.2.8	For the pillars of the earth are the 
1SA.2.8	He has set the world on them.
1SA.2.9	He will keep the feet of his holy ones,
1SA.2.9	but the wicked will be put to silence in darkness;
1SA.2.9	for no man will prevail by strength.
1SA.2.10	Those who strive with the 
1SA.2.10	He will thunder against them in the sky.
1SA.2.10	“The 
1SA.2.10	He will give strength to his king,
1SA.2.10	and exalt the horn of his anointed.”
1SA.2.11	Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served the 
1SA.2.12	Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They didn’t know the 
1SA.2.13	The custom of the priests with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant came while the meat was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand; 
1SA.2.14	and he stabbed it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. The priest took all that the fork brought up for himself. They did this to all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh. 
1SA.2.15	Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.”
1SA.2.16	If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burnt first, and then take as much as your soul desires;” then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.” 
1SA.2.17	The sin of the young men was very great before the 
1SA.2.18	But Samuel ministered before the 
1SA.2.19	Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
1SA.2.20	Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, “May The 
1SA.2.21	The 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they slept with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
1SA.2.23	He said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people. 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear! You make the

1SA.2.26	The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the 
1SA.2.27	A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “The 
1SA.2.28	Didn’t I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? Didn’t I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire? 
1SA.2.29	Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honour your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’ 
1SA.2.30	“Therefore the 
1SA.2.31	Behold,
1SA.2.32	You will see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I will give Israel. There shall not be an old man in your house forever. 
1SA.2.33	The man of yours whom I don’t cut off from my altar will consume your eyes
1SA.2.34	This will be the sign to you that will come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they will both die. 
1SA.2.35	I will raise up a faithful priest for myself who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house. He will walk before my anointed forever. 
1SA.2.36	It will happen that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, “Please put me into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.”’”
1SA.3.1	The child Samuel ministered to the 
1SA.3.2	At that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see), 
1SA.3.3	and God’s lamp hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in the 
1SA.3.4	The 
1SA.3.5	He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.”
1SA.3.5	He said, “I didn’t call. Lie down again.”
1SA.3.5	He went and lay down. 
1SA.3.6	The 
1SA.3.6	Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.”
1SA.3.6	He answered, “I didn’t call, my son. Lie down again.” 
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel didn’t yet know the 
1SA.3.8	The 
1SA.3.8	Eli perceived that the 
1SA.3.9	Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down. It shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, the 
1SA.3.10	The 
1SA.3.10	Then Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant hears.”
1SA.3.11	The 
1SA.3.12	In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end. 
1SA.3.13	For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them. 
1SA.3.14	Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be removed with sacrifice or offering forever.”
1SA.3.15	Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the 
1SA.3.16	Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!”
1SA.3.16	He said, “Here I am.”
1SA.3.17	He said, “What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please don’t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you.”
1SA.3.18	Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him.
1SA.3.18	He said, “It is the 
1SA.3.19	Samuel grew, and the 
1SA.3.20	All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the 
1SA.3.21	The 
1SA.4.1	The word of Samuel came to all Israel.
1SA.4.1	Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek. 
1SA.4.2	The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. When they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field. 
1SA.4.3	When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the 
1SA.4.4	So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.5	When the ark of the 
1SA.4.6	When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” They understood that the 
1SA.4.7	The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” They said, “Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before. 
1SA.4.8	Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 
1SA.4.9	Be strong and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!” 
1SA.4.10	The Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter; for thirty thousand footmen of Israel fell. 
1SA.4.11	God’s ark was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
1SA.4.12	A man of Benjamin ran out of the army and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. 
1SA.4.13	When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for God’s ark. When the man came into the city and told about it, all the city cried out. 
1SA.4.14	When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, “What does the noise of this tumult mean?”
1SA.4.14	The man hurried, and came and told Eli. 
1SA.4.15	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old. His eyes were set, so that he could not see. 
1SA.4.16	The man said to Eli, “I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army.”
1SA.4.16	He said, “How did the matter go, my son?”
1SA.4.17	He who brought the news answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter amongst the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and God’s ark has been captured.”
1SA.4.18	When he made mention of God’s ark, Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died, for he was an old man and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
1SA.4.19	His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to giving birth. When she heard the news that God’s ark was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth; for her pains came on her. 
1SA.4.20	About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she didn’t answer, neither did she regard it. 
1SA.4.21	She named the child Ichabod,
1SA.4.22	She said, “The glory has departed from Israel; for God’s ark has been taken.”
1SA.5.1	Now the Philistines had taken God’s ark, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	The Philistines took God’s ark, and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	When the people of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the 
1SA.5.4	When they arose early on the following morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the 
1SA.5.5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon’s house step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day. 
1SA.5.6	But the 
1SA.5.7	When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us, for his hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.” 
1SA.5.8	They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?”
1SA.5.8	They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath.” They carried the ark of the God of Israel there. 
1SA.5.9	It was so, that after they had carried it there, the 
1SA.5.10	So they sent God’s ark to Ekron.
1SA.5.10	As God’s ark came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel here to us, to kill us and our people.” 
1SA.5.11	They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, “Send the ark of the God of Israel away, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly panic throughout all the city. The hand of God was very heavy there. 
1SA.5.12	The men who didn’t die were struck with the tumours; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	The 
1SA.6.2	The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the 
1SA.6.3	They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, don’t send it empty; but by all means return a trespass offering to him. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.”
1SA.6.4	Then they said, “What should the trespass offering be which we shall return to him?”
1SA.6.4	They said, “Five golden tumours and five golden mice, for the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. 
1SA.6.5	Therefore you shall make images of your tumours and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will release his hand from you, from your gods, and from your land. 
1SA.6.6	Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had worked wonderfully amongst them, didn’t they let the people go, and they departed?
1SA.6.7	“Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart and two milk cows on which there has come no yoke; and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them; 
1SA.6.8	and take the 
1SA.6.9	Behold, if it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil; but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us. It was a chance that happened to us.”
1SA.6.10	The men did so, and took two milk cows and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 
1SA.6.11	They put the 
1SA.6.12	The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh. They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and didn’t turn away to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh. 
1SA.6.13	The people of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. 
1SA.6.14	The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was a great stone. Then they split the wood of the cart and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to the 
1SA.6.15	The Levites took down the 
1SA.6.16	When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day. 
1SA.6.17	These are the golden tumours which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to the 
1SA.6.18	and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone on which they set down the 
1SA.6.19	He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the 
1SA.6.20	The men of Beth Shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the 
1SA.6.21	They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the 
1SA.7.1	The men of Kiriath Jearim came and took the 
1SA.7.2	From the day that the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, the time was long—for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel lamented after the 
1SA.7.3	Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you are returning to the 
1SA.7.4	Then the children of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served the 
1SA.7.5	Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the 
1SA.7.6	They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before the 
1SA.7.7	When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. 
1SA.7.8	The children of Israel said to Samuel, “Don’t stop crying to the 
1SA.7.9	Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to the 
1SA.7.10	As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines came near to battle against Israel; but the 
1SA.7.11	The men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them until they came under Beth Kar.
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer,
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped coming within the border of Israel. The 
1SA.7.14	The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
1SA.7.16	He went from year to year in a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places. 
1SA.7.17	His return was to Ramah, for his house was there, and he judged Israel there; and he built an altar to the 
1SA.8.1	When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel. 
1SA.8.2	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	His sons didn’t walk in his ways, but turned away after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel to Ramah. 
1SA.8.5	They said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons don’t walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.” 
1SA.8.6	But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.”
1SA.8.6	Samuel prayed to the 
1SA.8.7	The 
1SA.8.8	According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so they also do to you. 
1SA.8.9	Now therefore, listen to their voice. However, you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who will reign over them.”
1SA.8.10	Samuel told all the 
1SA.8.11	He said, “This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them as his servants, for his chariots and to be his horsemen; and they will run before his chariots. 
1SA.8.12	He will appoint them to him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plough his ground and to reap his harvest; and to make his instruments of war and the instruments of his chariots. 
1SA.8.13	He will take your daughters to be perfumers, to be cooks, and to be bakers. 
1SA.8.14	He will take your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, even your best, and give them to his servants. 
1SA.8.15	He will take one tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give it to his officers and to his servants. 
1SA.8.16	He will take your male servants, your female servants, your best young men, and your donkeys, and assign them to his own work. 
1SA.8.17	He will take one tenth of your flocks; and you will be his servants. 
1SA.8.18	You will cry out in that day because of your king whom you will have chosen for yourselves; and the 
1SA.8.19	But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No, but we will have a king over us, 
1SA.8.20	that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.”
1SA.8.21	Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the 
1SA.8.22	The 
1SA.8.22	Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Everyone go to your own city.”
1SA.9.1	Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valour. 
1SA.9.2	He had a son whose name was Saul, an impressive young man; and there was not amongst the children of Israel a more handsome person than he. From his shoulders and upward he was taller than any of the people.
1SA.9.3	The donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. Kish said to Saul his son, “Now take one of the servants with you, and arise, go look for the donkeys.” 
1SA.9.4	He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn’t find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they weren’t there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn’t find them.
1SA.9.5	When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come! Let’s return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys and be anxious for us.”
1SA.9.6	The servant said to him, “Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man who is held in honour. All that he says surely happens. Now let’s go there. Perhaps he can tell us which way to go.”
1SA.9.7	Then Saul said to his servant, “But behold, if we go, what should we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our sacks, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?”
1SA.9.8	The servant answered Saul again and said, “Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel
1SA.9.9	(In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, he said, “Come! Let’s go to the seer;” for he who is now called a prophet was before called a seer.)
1SA.9.10	Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said. Come! Let’s go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was. 
1SA.9.11	As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”
1SA.9.12	They answered them and said, “He is. Behold, he is before you. Hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place. 
1SA.9.13	As soon as you have come into the city, you will immediately find him before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice. Afterwards those who are invited eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you will find him.”
1SA.9.14	They went up to the city. As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out towards them to go up to the high place.
1SA.9.15	Now the 
1SA.9.16	“Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come to me.”
1SA.9.17	When Samuel saw Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Then Saul approached Samuel in the gateway, and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”
1SA.9.19	Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you are to eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart. 
1SA.9.20	As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don’t set your mind on them, for they have been found. For whom does all Israel desire? Is it not you and all your father’s house?”
1SA.9.21	Saul answered, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me like this?”
1SA.9.22	Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place amongst those who were invited, who were about thirty persons. 
1SA.9.23	Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it aside.’” 
1SA.9.24	The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. Samuel said, “Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before yourself and eat; because it has been kept for you for the appointed time, for I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
1SA.9.25	When they had come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop. 
1SA.9.26	They arose early; and about daybreak, Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, “Get up, that I may send you away.” Saul arose, and they both went outside, he and Samuel, together. 
1SA.9.27	As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” He went ahead, then Samuel said, “But stand still first, that I may cause you to hear God’s message.”
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it on his head, then kissed him and said, “Hasn’t the 
1SA.10.2	When you have departed from me today, then you will find two men by Rachel’s tomb, on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will tell you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, “What shall I do for my son?”’
1SA.10.3	“Then you will go on forward from there, and you will come to the oak of Tabor. Three men will meet you there going up to God to Bethel: one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a container of wine. 
1SA.10.4	They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hand.
1SA.10.5	“After that you will come to the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is; and it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lute, a tambourine, a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying. 
1SA.10.6	Then the 
1SA.10.7	Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do what is appropriate for the occasion; for God is with you.
1SA.10.8	“Go down ahead of me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Wait seven days, until I come to you and show you what you are to do.” 
1SA.10.9	It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs happened that day. 
1SA.10.10	When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied amongst them. 
1SA.10.11	When all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said to one another, “What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also amongst the prophets?”
1SA.10.12	One from the same place answered, “Who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also amongst the prophets?” 
1SA.10.13	When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
1SA.10.14	Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?”
1SA.10.14	He said, “To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.”
1SA.10.15	Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”
1SA.10.16	Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys were found.” But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn’t tell him.
1SA.10.17	Samuel called the people together to the 
1SA.10.18	and he said to the children of Israel, “The 
1SA.10.19	But you have today rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, ‘No! Set a king over us!’ Now therefore present yourselves before the 
1SA.10.20	So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen. 
1SA.10.21	He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families and the family of the Matrites was chosen. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen; but when they looked for him, he could not be found. 
1SA.10.22	Therefore they asked of the 
1SA.10.22	The 
1SA.10.23	They ran and got him there. When he stood amongst the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. 
1SA.10.24	Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom the 
1SA.10.24	All the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!”
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the 
1SA.10.26	Saul also went to his house in Gibeah; and the army went with him, whose hearts God had touched. 
1SA.10.27	But certain worthless fellows said, “How could this man save us?” They despised him, and brought him no tribute. But he held his peace.
1SA.11.1	Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.”
1SA.11.2	Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make it with you, that all your right eyes be gouged out. I will make this dishonour all Israel.”
1SA.11.3	The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you.” 
1SA.11.4	Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people, then all the people lifted up their voice and wept.
1SA.11.5	Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, “What ails the people that they weep?” They told him the words of the men of Jabesh. 
1SA.11.6	God’s Spirit came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger burnt hot. 
1SA.11.7	He took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, then sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever doesn’t come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.” The dread of the 
1SA.11.8	He counted them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 
1SA.11.9	They said to the messengers who came, “Tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will be rescued.’” The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. 
1SA.11.10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.” 
1SA.11.11	On the next day, Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the middle of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day. Those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
1SA.11.12	The people said to Samuel, “Who is he who said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring those men, that we may put them to death!”
1SA.11.13	Saul said, “No man shall be put to death today; for today the 
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come! Let’s go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.” 
1SA.11.15	All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the 
1SA.12.1	Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	Now, behold, the king walks before you. I am old and grey-headed. Behold, my sons are with you. I have walked before you from my youth to this day. 
1SA.12.3	Here I am. Witness against me before the 
1SA.12.4	They said, “You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything from anyone’s hand.”
1SA.12.5	He said to them, “The 
1SA.12.5	They said, “He is witness.” 
1SA.12.6	Samuel said to the people, “It is the 
1SA.12.7	Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before the 
1SA.12.8	“When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the 
1SA.12.9	But they forgot the 
1SA.12.10	They cried to the 
1SA.12.11	The 
1SA.12.12	“When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us,’ when the 
1SA.12.13	Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen and whom you have asked for. Behold, the 
1SA.12.14	If you will fear the 
1SA.12.15	But if you will not listen to the 
1SA.12.16	“Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which the 
1SA.12.17	Isn’t it wheat harvest today? I will call to the 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called to the 
1SA.12.19	All the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to the 
1SA.12.20	Samuel said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. You have indeed done all this evil; yet don’t turn away from following the 
1SA.12.21	Don’t turn away to go after vain things which can’t profit or deliver, for they are vain. 
1SA.12.22	For the 
1SA.12.23	Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the 
1SA.12.24	Only fear the 
1SA.12.25	But if you keep doing evil, you will be consumed, both you and your king.”
1SA.13.1	Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years.
1SA.13.2	Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. He sent the rest of the people to their own tents. 
1SA.13.3	Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!” 
1SA.13.4	All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was considered an abomination to the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal. 
1SA.13.5	The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel: thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven. 
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits. 
1SA.13.7	Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. 
1SA.13.8	He stayed seven days, according to the time set by Samuel; but Samuel didn’t come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him. 
1SA.13.9	Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering to me here, and the peace offerings.” He offered the burnt offering.
1SA.13.10	It came to pass that as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him. 
1SA.13.11	Samuel said, “What have you done?”
1SA.13.11	Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn’t come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash, 
1SA.13.12	therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven’t entreated the favour of the 
1SA.13.13	Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the 
1SA.13.14	But now your kingdom will not continue. The 
1SA.13.15	Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul counted the people who were present with him, about six hundred men. 
1SA.13.16	Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 
1SA.13.17	The raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual; 
1SA.13.18	another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim towards the wilderness. 
1SA.13.19	Now there was no blacksmith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears”; 
1SA.13.20	but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, each man to sharpen his own ploughshare, mattock, axe, and sickle. 
1SA.13.21	The price was one payim
1SA.13.22	So it came to pass in the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.
1SA.13.23	The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
1SA.14.1	Now it happened on a day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armour, “Come! Let’s go over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he didn’t tell his father. 
1SA.14.2	Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron; and the people who were with him were about six hundred men, 
1SA.14.3	including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of the 
1SA.14.4	Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba. 
1SA.14.6	Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armour, “Come! Let’s go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the 
1SA.14.7	His armour bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Go, and behold, I am with you according to your heart.”
1SA.14.8	Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will reveal ourselves to them. 
1SA.14.9	If they say this to us, ‘Wait until we come to you!’ then we will stand still in our place and will not go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say this, ‘Come up to us!’ then we will go up, for the 
1SA.14.11	Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, “Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!” 
1SA.14.12	The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armour bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something!”
1SA.14.12	Jonathan said to his armour bearer, “Come up after me, for the 
1SA.14.13	Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armour bearer after him, and they fell before Jonathan; and his armour bearer killed them after him. 
1SA.14.14	That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armour bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.
1SA.14.15	There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and amongst all the people; the garrison and the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked, so there was an exceedingly great trembling. 
1SA.14.16	The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away and scattered. 
1SA.14.17	Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count now, and see who is missing from us.” When they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armour bearer were not there.
1SA.14.18	Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring God’s ark here.” For God’s ark was with the children of Israel at that time. 
1SA.14.19	While Saul talked to the priest, the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand!”
1SA.14.20	Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle; and behold, they were all striking each other with their swords in very great confusion. 
1SA.14.21	Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before and who went up with them into the camp from all around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
1SA.14.22	Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. 
1SA.14.23	So the 
1SA.14.24	The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.
1SA.14.25	All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground. 
1SA.14.26	When the people had come to the forest, behold, honey was dripping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. 
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan didn’t hear when his father commanded the people with the oath. Therefore he put out the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened. 
1SA.14.28	Then one of the people answered, and said, “Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’” So the people were faint.
1SA.14.29	Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. 
1SA.14.30	How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the plunder of their enemies which they found? For now there has been no great slaughter amongst the Philistines.” 
1SA.14.31	They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint; 
1SA.14.32	and the people pounced on the plunder, and took sheep, cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood. 
1SA.14.33	Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against the 
1SA.14.33	He said, “You have dealt treacherously. Roll a large stone to me today!” 
1SA.14.34	Saul said, “Disperse yourselves amongst the people, and tell them, ‘Every man bring me here his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don’t sin against the 
1SA.14.35	Saul built an altar to the 
1SA.14.36	Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines by night, and take plunder amongst them until the morning light. Let’s not leave a man of them.”
1SA.14.36	They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.”
1SA.14.36	Then the priest said, “Let’s draw near here to God.”
1SA.14.37	Saul asked counsel of God: “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But he didn’t answer him that day. 
1SA.14.38	Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see in whom this sin has been today. 
1SA.14.39	For as the 
1SA.14.40	Then he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.”
1SA.14.40	The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”
1SA.14.41	Therefore Saul said to the 
1SA.14.41	Jonathan and Saul were chosen, but the people escaped.
1SA.14.42	Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.”
1SA.14.42	Jonathan was selected.
1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done!”
1SA.14.43	Jonathan told him, and said, “I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.”
1SA.14.44	Saul said, “God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”
1SA.14.45	The people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
1SA.14.47	Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned himself, he defeated them. 
1SA.14.48	He did valiantly and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them. 
1SA.14.49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal. 
1SA.14.50	The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 
1SA.14.51	Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man, he took him into his service.
1SA.15.1	Samuel said to Saul, “The 
1SA.15.2	The 
1SA.15.3	Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don’t spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”
1SA.15.4	Saul summoned the people, and counted them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah. 
1SA.15.5	Saul came to the city of Amalek, and set an ambush in the valley. 
1SA.15.6	Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from amongst the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from amongst the Amalekites.
1SA.15.7	Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, which is before Egypt. 
1SA.15.8	He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, of the cattle, of the fat calves, of the lambs, and all that was good, and were not willing to utterly destroy them; but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
1SA.15.10	Then the 
1SA.15.11	“It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king, for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.” Samuel was angry; and he cried to the 
1SA.15.12	Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and Samuel was told, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, turned, passed on, and went down to Gilgal.”
1SA.15.13	Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, “You are blessed by the 
1SA.15.14	Samuel said, “Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?”
1SA.15.15	Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stay, and I will tell you what the 
1SA.15.16	He said to him, “Say on.”
1SA.15.17	Samuel said, “Though you were little in your own sight, weren’t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? The 
1SA.15.18	and the 
1SA.15.19	Why then didn’t you obey the 
1SA.15.20	Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed the 
1SA.15.21	But the people took of the plunder, sheep and cattle, the best of the devoted things, to sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.22	Samuel said, “Has the 
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim.
1SA.15.24	Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the 
1SA.15.25	Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the 
1SA.15.26	Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected the 
1SA.15.27	As Samuel turned around to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore. 
1SA.15.28	Samuel said to him, “The 
1SA.15.29	Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.”
1SA.15.30	Then he said, “I have sinned; yet please honour me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship the 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel went back with Saul; and Saul worshipped the 
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag the king of the Amalekites here to me!”
1SA.15.32	Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”
1SA.15.33	Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless amongst women!” Then Samuel cut Agag in pieces before the 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 
1SA.15.35	Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death, but Samuel mourned for Saul. The 
1SA.16.1	The 
1SA.16.2	Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.”
1SA.16.2	The 
1SA.16.3	Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.”
1SA.16.4	Samuel did that which the 
1SA.16.5	He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the 
1SA.16.6	When they had come, he looked at Eliab, and said, “Surely the 
1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “The 
1SA.16.9	Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, “The 
1SA.16.10	Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, “The 
1SA.16.11	Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your children here?”
1SA.16.11	He said, “There remains yet the youngest. Behold, he is keeping the sheep.”
1SA.16.11	Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.”
1SA.16.12	He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with a handsome face and good appearance. The 
1SA.16.13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the middle of his brothers. Then the 
1SA.16.14	Now the 
1SA.16.15	Saul’s servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you. 
1SA.16.16	Let our lord now command your servants who are in front of you to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp. Then when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will play with his hand, and you will be well.”
1SA.16.17	Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.”
1SA.16.18	Then one of the young men answered and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilful in playing, a mighty man of valour, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and the 
1SA.16.19	Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.”
1SA.16.20	Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a container of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul. 
1SA.16.21	David came to Saul and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armour bearer. 
1SA.16.22	Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, for he has found favour in my sight.” 
1SA.16.23	When the spirit from God was on Saul, David took the harp and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephesdammim. 
1SA.17.2	Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them. 
1SA.17.4	A champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span
1SA.17.5	He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he wore a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels
1SA.17.6	He had bronze shin armour on his legs and a bronze javelin between his shoulders. 
1SA.17.7	The staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron.
1SA.17.8	He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. 
1SA.17.9	If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us.” 
1SA.17.10	The Philistine said, “I defy the armies of Israel today! Give me a man, that we may fight together!”
1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid. 
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons. The man was an elderly old man in the days of Saul. 
1SA.17.13	The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 
1SA.17.14	David was the youngest; and the three oldest followed Saul. 
1SA.17.15	Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.
1SA.17.16	The Philistine came near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
1SA.17.17	Jesse said to David his son, “Now take for your brothers an ephah
1SA.17.18	and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand; and see how your brothers are doing, and bring back news.” 
1SA.17.19	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
1SA.17.20	David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper, and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the place of the wagons as the army which was going out to the fight shouted for the battle. 
1SA.17.21	Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army. 
1SA.17.22	David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers. 
1SA.17.23	As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and said the same words; and David heard them. 
1SA.17.24	All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were terrified. 
1SA.17.25	The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? He has surely come up to defy Israel. The king will give great riches to the man who kills him, and will give him his daughter, and will make his father’s house tax-free in Israel.”
1SA.17.26	David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”
1SA.17.27	The people answered him in this way, saying, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.”
1SA.17.28	Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger burnt against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the evil of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle.”
1SA.17.29	David said, “What have I now done? Is there not a cause?” 
1SA.17.30	He turned away from him towards another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way. 
1SA.17.31	When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him. 
1SA.17.32	David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”
1SA.17.33	Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.”
1SA.17.34	David said to Saul, “Your servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, 
1SA.17.35	I went out after him, struck him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, struck him, and killed him. 
1SA.17.36	Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.” 
1SA.17.37	David said, “The 
1SA.17.37	Saul said to David, “Go! The 
1SA.17.38	Saul dressed David with his clothing. He put a helmet of bronze on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail. 
1SA.17.39	David strapped his sword on his clothing and he tried to move, for he had not tested it. David said to Saul, “I can’t go with these, for I have not tested them.” Then David took them off.
1SA.17.40	He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag which he had. His sling was in his hand; and he came near to the Philistine. 
1SA.17.41	The Philistine walked and came near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him. 
1SA.17.42	When the Philistine looked around and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and had a good looking face. 
1SA.17.43	The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
1SA.17.44	The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and to the animals of the field.”
1SA.17.45	Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to you in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	Today, the 
1SA.17.47	and that all this assembly may know that the 
1SA.17.48	When the Philistine arose, and walked and came near to meet David, David hurried and ran towards the army to meet the Philistine. 
1SA.17.49	David put his hand in his bag, took a stone and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth. 
1SA.17.50	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword David’s hand. 
1SA.17.51	Then David ran, stood over the Philistine, took his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it.
1SA.17.51	When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 
1SA.17.52	The men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as Gai and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and to Ekron. 
1SA.17.53	The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp. 
1SA.17.54	David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armour in his tent. 
1SA.17.55	When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?”
1SA.17.55	Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I can’t tell.”
1SA.17.56	The king said, “Enquire whose son the young man is!”
1SA.17.57	As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
1SA.17.58	Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, you young man?”
1SA.17.58	David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”
1SA.18.1	When he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 
1SA.18.2	Saul took him that day, and wouldn’t let him go home to his father’s house any more. 
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 
1SA.18.4	Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David with his clothing, even including his sword, his bow, and his sash.
1SA.18.5	David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely; and Saul set him over the men of war. It was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.
1SA.18.6	As they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music. 
1SA.18.7	The women sang to one another as they played, and said,
1SA.18.7	“Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.18.7	and David his ten thousands.”
1SA.18.8	Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, “They have creditd David with ten thousands, and they have only credited me with thousands. What can he have more but the kingdom?” 
1SA.18.9	Saul watched David from that day and forward. 
1SA.18.10	On the next day, an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house. David played with his hand, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand; 
1SA.18.11	and Saul threw the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” David escaped from his presence twice. 
1SA.18.12	Saul was afraid of David, because the 
1SA.18.13	Therefore Saul removed him from his presence, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
1SA.18.14	David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the 
1SA.18.15	When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him. 
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them. 
1SA.18.17	Saul said to David, “Behold, my elder daughter Merab. I will give her to you as wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight the 
1SA.18.18	David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”
1SA.18.19	But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.
1SA.18.20	Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. 
1SA.18.21	Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David a second time, “You shall today be my son-in-law.”
1SA.18.22	Saul commanded his servants, “Talk with David secretly, and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.’”
1SA.18.23	Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, “Does it seem to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man and little known?”
1SA.18.24	The servants of Saul told him, saying, “David spoke like this.”
1SA.18.25	Saul said, “Tell David, ‘The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies.’” Now Saul thought he would make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
1SA.18.26	When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the deadline, 
1SA.18.27	David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife. 
1SA.18.28	Saul saw and knew that the 
1SA.18.29	Saul was even more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.
1SA.18.30	Then the princes of the Philistines went out; and as often as they went out, David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.
1SA.19.1	Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, greatly delighted in David. 
1SA.19.2	Jonathan told David, saying, “Saul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself. 
1SA.19.3	I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my father about you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.”
1SA.19.4	Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Don’t let the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good towards you; 
1SA.19.5	for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and the 
1SA.19.6	Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, “As the 
1SA.19.7	Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as before.
1SA.19.8	There was war again. David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.
1SA.19.9	An evil spirit from the 
1SA.19.10	Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled, and escaped that night. 
1SA.19.11	Saul sent messengers to David’s house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning. Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you don’t save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.” 
1SA.19.12	So Michal let David down through the window. He went away, fled, and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	Michal took the teraphim,
1SA.19.14	When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”
1SA.19.15	Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.” 
1SA.19.16	When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’ hair at its head.
1SA.19.17	Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?”
1SA.19.17	Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’”
1SA.19.18	Now David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth. 
1SA.19.19	Saul was told, saying, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.”
1SA.19.20	Saul sent messengers to seize David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, God’s Spirit came on Saul’s messengers, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.21	When Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.22	Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?”
1SA.19.22	One said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.”
1SA.19.23	He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then God’s Spirit came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
1SA.19.24	He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also amongst the prophets?”
1SA.20.1	David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”
1SA.20.2	He said to him, “Far from it; you will not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me. Why would my father hide this thing from me? It is not so.”
1SA.20.3	David swore moreover, and said, “Your father knows well that I have found favour in your eyes; and he says, ‘Don’t let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved;’ but truly as the 
1SA.20.4	Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.”
1SA.20.5	David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening. 
1SA.20.6	If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’ 
1SA.20.7	If he says, ‘It is well,’ your servant shall have peace; but if he is angry, then know that evil is determined by him. 
1SA.20.8	Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the 
1SA.20.9	Jonathan said, “Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then wouldn’t I tell you that?”
1SA.20.10	Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?”
1SA.20.11	Jonathan said to David, “Come! Let’s go out into the field.” They both went out into the field. 
1SA.20.12	Jonathan said to David, “By the 
1SA.20.13	The 
1SA.20.14	You shall not only show me the loving kindness of the 
1SA.20.15	but you shall also not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when the 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made a covenant with David’s house, saying, “The 
1SA.20.17	Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul. 
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. 
1SA.20.19	When you have stayed three days, go down quickly, and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started, and remain by the stone Ezel. 
1SA.20.20	I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark. 
1SA.20.21	Behold, I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ If I tell the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are on this side of you. Take them;’ then come; for there is peace to you and no danger, as the 
1SA.20.22	But if I say this to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you;’ then go your way; for the 
1SA.20.23	Concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the 
1SA.20.24	So David hid himself in the field. When the new moon had come, the king sat himself down to eat food. 
1SA.20.25	The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty. 
1SA.20.26	Nevertheless Saul didn’t say anything that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean.”
1SA.20.27	On the next day after the new moon, the second day, David’s place was empty. Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why doesn’t the son of Jesse come to eat, either yesterday, or today?”
1SA.20.28	Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem. 
1SA.20.29	He said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favour in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the king’s table.”
1SA.20.30	Then Saul’s anger burnt against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? 
1SA.20.31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you will not be established, nor will your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!”
1SA.20.32	Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”
1SA.20.33	Saul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death. 
1SA.20.34	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully. 
1SA.20.35	In the morning, Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him. 
1SA.20.36	He said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 
1SA.20.37	When the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” 
1SA.20.38	Jonathan cried after the boy, “Go fast! Hurry! Don’t delay!” Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. 
1SA.20.39	But the boy didn’t know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter. 
1SA.20.40	Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.”
1SA.20.41	As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another, and wept with one another, and David wept the most. 
1SA.20.42	Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, because we have both sworn in the 
1SA.21.1	Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no man with you?” 
1SA.21.2	David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commanded me to do something, and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you. I have sent the young men to a certain place.’ 
1SA.21.3	Now therefore what is under your hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever is available.”
1SA.21.4	The priest answered David, and said, “I have no common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.”
1SA.21.5	David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us as usual these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was only a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?” 
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before the 
1SA.21.7	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the 
1SA.21.8	David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I haven’t brought my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”
1SA.21.9	The priest said, “Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you would like to take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.”
1SA.21.9	David said, “There is none like that. Give it to me.”
1SA.21.10	David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Didn’t they sing to one another about him in dances, saying,
1SA.21.11	‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.21.11	and David his ten thousands?’”
1SA.21.12	David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 
1SA.21.13	He changed his behaviour before them, and pretended to be insane in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard. 
1SA.21.14	Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why then have you brought him to me? 
1SA.21.15	Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Should this fellow come into my house?”
1SA.22.1	David therefore departed from there, and escaped to Adullam’s cave. When his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him. 
1SA.22.2	Everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them. There were with him about four hundred men. 
1SA.22.3	David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother come out with you, until I know what God will do for me.” 
1SA.22.4	He brought them before the king of Moab; and they lived with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. 
1SA.22.5	The prophet Gad said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold. Depart, and go into the land of Judah.”
1SA.22.5	Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth. 
1SA.22.6	Saul heard that David was discovered, with the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him. 
1SA.22.7	Saul said to his servants who stood around him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, 
1SA.22.8	that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes a treaty with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as it is today?”
1SA.22.9	Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 
1SA.22.10	He enquired of the 
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob; and they all came to the king. 
1SA.22.12	Saul said, “Hear now, you son of Ahitub.”
1SA.22.12	He answered, “Here I am, my lord.”
1SA.22.13	Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as it is today?”
1SA.22.14	Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, “Who amongst all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, captain of your body guard, and honoured in your house? 
1SA.22.15	Have I today begun to enquire of God for him? Be it far from me! Don’t let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more.”
1SA.22.16	The king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father’s house.” 
1SA.22.17	The king said to the guard who stood about him, “Turn, and kill the priests of the 
1SA.22.18	The king said to Doeg, “Turn and attack the priests!”
1SA.22.18	Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five people who wore a linen ephod. 
1SA.22.19	He struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies, and cattle and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword. 
1SA.22.20	One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. 
1SA.22.21	Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the 
1SA.22.22	David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father’s house. 
1SA.22.23	Stay with me. Don’t be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. For you will be safe with me.”
1SA.23.1	David was told, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.”
1SA.23.2	Therefore David enquired of the 
1SA.23.2	The 
1SA.23.3	David’s men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”
1SA.23.4	Then David enquired of the 
1SA.23.5	David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. 
1SA.23.6	When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand.
1SA.23.7	Saul was told that David had come to Keilah. Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in by entering into a town that has gates and bars.” 
1SA.23.8	Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 
1SA.23.9	David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.” 
1SA.23.10	Then David said, “O 
1SA.23.11	Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? 
1SA.23.11	The 
1SA.23.12	Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?”
1SA.23.12	The 
1SA.23.13	Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah; and he gave up going there. 
1SA.23.14	David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God didn’t deliver him into his hand. 
1SA.23.15	David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the woods.
1SA.23.16	Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the woods, and strengthened his hand in God. 
1SA.23.17	He said to him, “Don’t be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father won’t find you; and you will be king over Israel, and I will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also.” 
1SA.23.18	They both made a covenant before the 
1SA.23.19	Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the woods, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert? 
1SA.23.20	Now therefore, O king, come down. According to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part will be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.”
1SA.23.21	Saul said, “You are blessed by the 
1SA.23.22	Please go make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for I have been told that he is very cunning. 
1SA.23.23	See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come again to me with certainty, and I will go with you. It shall happen, if he is in the land, that I will search him out amongst all the thousands of Judah.”
1SA.23.24	They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert. 
1SA.23.25	Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon. 
1SA.23.26	Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David hurried to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them. 
1SA.23.27	But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!” 
1SA.23.28	So Saul returned from pursuing David, and went against the Philistines. Therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.
1SA.23.29	David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.
1SA.24.1	When Saul had returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.” 
1SA.24.2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats. 
1SA.24.3	He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were staying in the innermost parts of the cave. 
1SA.24.4	David’s men said to him, “Behold, the day of which the 
1SA.24.5	Afterward, David’s heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt. 
1SA.24.6	He said to his men, “The 
1SA.24.7	So David checked his men with these words, and didn’t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way. 
1SA.24.8	David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!”
1SA.24.8	When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect. 
1SA.24.9	David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to men’s words, saying, ‘Behold, David seeks to harm you?’ 
1SA.24.10	Behold, today your eyes have seen how the 
1SA.24.11	Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn’t kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it. 
1SA.24.12	May the 
1SA.24.13	As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness;’ but my hand will not be on you. 
1SA.24.14	Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea? 
1SA.24.15	May the 
1SA.24.16	It came to pass, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. 
1SA.24.17	He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you. 
1SA.24.18	You have declared today how you have dealt well with me, because when the 
1SA.24.19	For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may the 
1SA.24.20	Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. 
1SA.24.21	Swear now therefore to me by the 
1SA.24.22	David swore to Saul. Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
1SA.25.1	Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and mourned for him, and buried him at his house at Ramah.
1SA.25.1	Then David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. 
1SA.25.2	There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
1SA.25.3	Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail. This woman was intelligent and had a beautiful face; but the man was surly and evil in his doings. He was of the house of Caleb. 
1SA.25.4	David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
1SA.25.5	David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name. 
1SA.25.6	Tell him, ‘Long life to you! Peace be to you! Peace be to your house! Peace be to all that you have! 
1SA.25.7	Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we didn’t harm them. Nothing was missing from them all the time they were in Carmel. 
1SA.25.8	Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favour in your eyes; for we come on a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.’”
1SA.25.9	When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal all those words in the name of David, and waited.
1SA.25.10	Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants who break away from their masters these days. 
1SA.25.11	Shall I then take my bread, my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don’t know where they come from?”
1SA.25.12	So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him all these words.
1SA.25.13	David said to his men, “Every man put on his sword!”
1SA.25.13	Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David, and two hundred stayed by the baggage. 
1SA.25.14	But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master; and he insulted them. 
1SA.25.15	But the men were very good to us, and we were not harmed, and we didn’t miss anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields. 
1SA.25.16	They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 
1SA.25.17	Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can’t speak to him.”
1SA.25.18	Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two containers of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five seahs
1SA.25.19	She said to her young men, “Go on before me. Behold, I am coming after you.” But she didn’t tell her husband, Nabal. 
1SA.25.20	As she rode on her donkey, and came down hidden by the mountain, behold, David and his men came down towards her, and she met them.
1SA.25.21	Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good. 
1SA.25.22	God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.”
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got off her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground. 
1SA.25.24	She fell at his feet, and said, “On me, my lord, on me be the blame! Please let your servant speak in your ears. Hear the words of your servant. 
1SA.25.25	Please don’t let my lord pay attention to this worthless fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he. Nabal
1SA.25.26	Now therefore, my lord, as the 
1SA.25.27	Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord. 
1SA.25.28	Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For the 
1SA.25.29	Though men may rise up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord will be bound in the bundle of life with the 
1SA.25.30	It will come to pass, when the 
1SA.25.31	that this shall be no grief to you, nor offence of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. When the 
1SA.25.32	David said to Abigail, “Blessed is the 
1SA.25.33	Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, who have kept me today from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand. 
1SA.25.34	For indeed, as the 
1SA.25.35	So David received from her hand that which she had brought him. Then he said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request.”
1SA.25.36	Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. Therefore she told him nothing until the morning light. 
1SA.25.37	In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. 
1SA.25.38	About ten days later, the 
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed is the 
1SA.25.40	When David’s servants had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.”
1SA.25.41	She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, “Behold, your servant is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.” 
1SA.25.42	Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife. 
1SA.25.43	David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they both became his wives. 
1SA.25.44	Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
1SA.26.1	The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?” 
1SA.26.2	Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. 
1SA.26.3	Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. 
1SA.26.4	David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come. 
1SA.26.5	Then David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him.
1SA.26.6	Then David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?”
1SA.26.6	Abishai said, “I will go down with you.” 
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay around him. 
1SA.26.8	Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered up your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.”
1SA.26.9	David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against the 
1SA.26.10	David said, “As the 
1SA.26.11	The 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul’s head; and they went away. No man saw it, or knew it, nor did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the 
1SA.26.13	Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain far away, a great space being between them; 
1SA.26.14	and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Don’t you answer, Abner?”
1SA.26.14	Then Abner answered, “Who are you who cries to the king?”
1SA.26.15	David said to Abner, “Aren’t you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord. 
1SA.26.16	This thing isn’t good that you have done. As the 
1SA.26.17	Saul recognised David’s voice, and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?”
1SA.26.17	David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.” 
1SA.26.18	He said, “Why does my lord pursue his servant? For what have I done? What evil is in my hand? 
1SA.26.19	Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is so that the 
1SA.26.20	Now therefore, don’t let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the 
1SA.26.21	Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes today. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.”
1SA.26.22	David answered, “Behold the spear, O king! Then let one of the young men come over and get it. 
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	Behold, as your life was respected today in my eyes, so let my life be respected in the 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, “You are blessed, my son David. You will both do mightily, and will surely prevail.” So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1SA.27.1	David said in his heart, “I will now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel. So I will escape out of his hand.” 
1SA.27.2	David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife. 
1SA.27.4	Saul was told that David had fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him. 
1SA.27.5	David said to Achish, “If now I have found favour in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?” 
1SA.27.6	Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day. 
1SA.27.7	The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months. 
1SA.27.8	David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, on the way to Shur, even to the land of Egypt. 
1SA.27.9	David struck the land, and saved no man or woman alive, and took away the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned, and came to Achish.
1SA.27.10	Achish said, “Against whom have you made a raid today?”
1SA.27.10	David said, “Against the South of Judah, against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.” 
1SA.27.11	David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, “Lest they should tell about us, saying, ‘David did this, and this has been his way all the time he has lived in the country of the Philistines.’”
1SA.27.12	Achish believed David, saying, “He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him. Therefore he will be my servant forever.”
1SA.28.1	In those days, the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. Achish said to David, “Know assuredly that you will go out with me in the army, you and your men.”
1SA.28.2	David said to Achish, “Therefore you will know what your servant can do.”
1SA.28.2	Achish said to David, “Therefore I will make you my bodyguard forever.”
1SA.28.3	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. Saul had sent away those who had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land. 
1SA.28.4	The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. 
1SA.28.6	When Saul enquired of the 
1SA.28.7	Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek for me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her.”
1SA.28.7	His servants said to him, “Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at Endor.”
1SA.28.8	Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. Then he said, “Please consult for me by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomever I shall name to you.”
1SA.28.9	The woman said to him, “Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?”
1SA.28.10	Saul swore to her by the 
1SA.28.11	Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up to you?”
1SA.28.11	He said, “Bring Samuel up for me.”
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!”
1SA.28.13	The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid! What do you see?”
1SA.28.13	The woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.”
1SA.28.14	He said to her, “What does he look like?”
1SA.28.14	She said, “An old man comes up. He is covered with a robe.” Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and showed respect.
1SA.28.15	Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?”
1SA.28.15	Saul answered, “I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, by prophets, or by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.”
1SA.28.16	Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the 
1SA.28.17	The 
1SA.28.18	Because you didn’t obey the 
1SA.28.19	Moreover the 
1SA.28.20	Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was terrified, because of Samuel’s words. There was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all day long or all night long.
1SA.28.21	The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, “Behold, your servant has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me. 
1SA.28.22	Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your servant, and let me set a morsel of bread before you. Eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.”
1SA.28.23	But he refused, and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed. 
1SA.28.24	The woman had a fattened calf in the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it. 
1SA.28.25	She brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek; and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish.
1SA.29.3	Then the princes of the Philistines said, “What about these Hebrews?”
1SA.29.3	Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, “Isn’t this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years? I have found no fault in him since he fell away until today.”
1SA.29.4	But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, “Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For with what should this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Should it not be with the heads of these men? 
1SA.29.5	Isn’t this David, of whom people sang to one another in dances, saying,
1SA.29.5	‘Saul has slain his thousands,
1SA.29.5	and David his ten thousands?’”
1SA.29.6	Then Achish called David, and said to him, “As the 
1SA.29.7	Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease the lords of the Philistines.”
1SA.29.8	David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”
1SA.29.9	Achish answered David, “I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God. Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.’ 
1SA.29.10	Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.”
1SA.29.11	So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	When David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the South, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burnt it with fire, 
1SA.30.2	and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They didn’t kill any, but carried them off, and went their way. 
1SA.30.3	When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters were taken captive. 
1SA.30.4	Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep. 
1SA.30.5	David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
1SA.30.6	David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the souls of all the people were grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in the 
1SA.30.7	David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring the ephod here to me.”
1SA.30.7	Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 
1SA.30.8	David enquired of the 
1SA.30.8	He answered him, “Pursue; for you will surely overtake them, and will without fail recover all.”
1SA.30.9	So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed. 
1SA.30.10	But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn’t go over the brook Besor. 
1SA.30.11	They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink. 
1SA.30.12	They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, and drank no water for three days and three nights. 
1SA.30.13	David asked him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?”
1SA.30.13	He said, “I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I got sick. 
1SA.30.14	We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burnt Ziklag with fire.”
1SA.30.15	David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this troop?”
1SA.30.15	He said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and not deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.”
1SA.30.16	When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great plunder that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. 
1SA.30.17	David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled. 
1SA.30.18	David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither plunder, nor anything that they had taken. David brought them all back. 
1SA.30.20	David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, “This is David’s plunder.”
1SA.30.21	David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to the people, he greeted them. 
1SA.30.22	Then all the wicked men and worthless fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, “Because they didn’t go with us, we will not give them anything of the plunder that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.”
1SA.30.23	Then David said, “Do not do so, my brothers, with that which the 
1SA.30.24	Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays with the baggage. They shall share alike.” 
1SA.30.25	It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day. 
1SA.30.26	When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, “Behold, a present for you from the plunder of the 
1SA.30.27	He sent it to those who were in Bethel, to those who were in Ramoth of the South, to those who were in Jattir, 
1SA.30.28	to those who were in Aroer, to those who were in Siphmoth, to those who were in Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	to those who were in Racal, to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, to those who were in the cities of the Kenites, 
1SA.30.30	to those who were in Hormah, to those who were in Borashan, to those who were in Athach, 
1SA.30.31	to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay.
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
1SA.31.3	The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers. 
1SA.31.4	Then Saul said to his armour bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me!” But his armour bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it. 
1SA.31.5	When his armour bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour bearer, and all his men, that same day together.
1SA.31.7	When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them. 
1SA.31.8	On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	They cut off his head, stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people. 
1SA.31.10	They put his armour in the house of the Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan. 
1SA.31.11	When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	all the valiant men arose, went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. 
1SA.31.13	They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk
2SA.1.1	After the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag; 
2SA.1.2	on the third day, behold,
2SA.1.3	David said to him, “Where do you come from?”
2SA.1.3	He said to him, “I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.”
2SA.1.4	David said to him, “How did it go? Please tell me.”
2SA.1.4	He answered, “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead. Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.”
2SA.1.5	David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”
2SA.1.6	The young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed close behind him. 
2SA.1.7	When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, ‘Here I am.’ 
2SA.1.8	He said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ 
2SA.1.9	He said to me, ‘Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life lingers in me.’ 
2SA.1.10	So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.”
2SA.1.11	Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and all the men who were with him did likewise. 
2SA.1.12	They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the 
2SA.1.13	David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?”
2SA.1.13	He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”
2SA.1.14	David said to him, “Why were you not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy the 
2SA.1.15	David called one of the young men, and said, “Go near, and cut him down!” He struck him so that he died. 
2SA.1.16	David said to him, “Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have slain the 
2SA.1.17	David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son 
2SA.1.18	(and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
2SA.1.19	“Your glory, Israel, was slain on your high places!
2SA.1.19	How the mighty have fallen!
2SA.1.20	Don’t tell it in Gath.
2SA.1.20	Don’t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,
2SA.1.20	lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
2SA.1.20	lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
2SA.1.21	You mountains of Gilboa,
2SA.1.21	let there be no dew or rain on you, and no fields of offerings;
2SA.1.21	For there the shield of the mighty was defiled and cast away,
2SA.1.21	The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.
2SA.1.22	From the blood of the slain,
2SA.1.22	from the fat of the mighty,
2SA.1.22	Jonathan’s bow didn’t turn back.
2SA.1.22	Saul’s sword didn’t return empty.
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.
2SA.1.23	In their death, they were not divided.
2SA.1.23	They were swifter than eagles.
2SA.1.23	They were stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
2SA.1.24	who clothed you delicately in scarlet,
2SA.1.24	who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.
2SA.1.25	How the mighty have fallen in the middle of the battle!
2SA.1.25	Jonathan was slain on your high places.
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.
2SA.1.26	You have been very pleasant to me.
2SA.1.26	Your love to me was wonderful,
2SA.1.26	passing the love of women.
2SA.1.27	How the mighty have fallen,
2SA.1.27	and the weapons of war have perished!”
2SA.2.1	After this, David enquired of the 
2SA.2.1	The 
2SA.2.1	David said, “Where shall I go up?”
2SA.2.1	He said, “To Hebron.”
2SA.2.2	So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
2SA.2.3	David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household. They lived in the cities of Hebron. 
2SA.2.4	The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, “The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.” 
2SA.2.5	David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “Blessed are you by the 
2SA.2.6	Now may the 
2SA.2.7	Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.”
2SA.2.8	Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 
2SA.2.9	and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. 
2SA.2.10	Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. 
2SA.2.11	The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. 
2SA.2.12	Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	Joab the son of Zeruiah and David’s servants went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. 
2SA.2.14	Abner said to Joab, “Please let the young men arise and play before us!”
2SA.2.14	Joab said, “Let them arise!” 
2SA.2.15	Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of David’s servants. 
2SA.2.16	They each caught his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: therefore that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.
2SA.2.17	The battle was very severe that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before David’s servants. 
2SA.2.18	The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle. 
2SA.2.19	Asahel pursued Abner; and in going he didn’t turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner. 
2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him, and said, “Is that you, Asahel?”
2SA.2.20	He answered, “It is.”
2SA.2.21	Abner said to him, “Turn away to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armour.” But Asahel would not turn away from following him. 
2SA.2.22	Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn away from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I look Joab your brother in the face?” 
2SA.2.23	However he refused to turn away. Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. As many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. 
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. The sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. 
2SA.2.25	The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill. 
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called to Joab, and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Don’t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long will it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?”
2SA.2.27	Joab said, “As God
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued Israel no more, and they fought no more. 
2SA.2.29	Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim. 
2SA.2.30	Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen men of David’s and Asahel were missing. 
2SA.2.31	But David’s servants had struck Benjamin and of Abner’s men so that three hundred and sixty men died. 
2SA.2.32	They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.
2SA.3.1	Now there was long war between Saul’s house and David’s house. David grew stronger and stronger, but Saul’s house grew weaker and weaker. 
2SA.3.2	Sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 
2SA.3.3	and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 
2SA.3.4	and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; 
2SA.3.5	and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	While there was war between Saul’s house and David’s house, Abner made himself strong in Saul’s house. 
2SA.3.7	Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”
2SA.3.8	Then Abner was very angry about Ishbosheth’s words, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman! 
2SA.3.9	God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as the 
2SA.3.10	to transfer the kingdom from Saul’s house, and to set up David’s throne over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.”
2SA.3.11	He could not answer Abner another word, because he was afraid of him.
2SA.3.12	Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, “Whose is the land?” and saying, “Make your alliance with me, and behold, my hand will be with you, to bring all Israel around to you.”
2SA.3.13	He said, “Good. I will make a treaty with you, but one thing I require of you. That is, you will not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.”
2SA.3.14	David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I was given to marry for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”
2SA.3.15	Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish. 
2SA.3.16	Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go! Return!” and he returned. 
2SA.3.17	Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times past, you sought for David to be king over you. 
2SA.3.18	Now then do it; for the 
2SA.3.19	Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin. 
2SA.3.20	So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast. 
2SA.3.21	Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.” David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
2SA.3.22	Behold, David’s servants and Joab came from a raid, and brought in a great plunder with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”
2SA.3.24	Then Joab came to the king, and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, and he is already gone? 
2SA.3.25	You know Abner the son of Ner. He came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.”
2SA.3.26	When Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David didn’t know it. 
2SA.3.27	When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. 
2SA.3.28	Afterward, when David heard it, he said, “I and my kingdom are guiltless before the 
2SA.3.29	Let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house. Let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has a discharge, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.” 
2SA.3.30	So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. 
2SA.3.31	David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, and clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn in front of Abner.” King David followed the bier. 
2SA.3.32	They buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at Abner’s grave; and all the people wept. 
2SA.3.33	The king lamented for Abner, and said, “Should Abner die as a fool dies? 
2SA.3.34	Your hands weren’t bound, and your feet weren’t put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.”
2SA.3.34	All the people wept again over him. 
2SA.3.35	All the people came to urge David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun goes down.”
2SA.3.36	All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people. 
2SA.3.37	So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner. 
2SA.3.38	The king said to his servants, “Don’t you know that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel? 
2SA.3.39	I am weak today, though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May the 
2SA.4.1	When Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. 
2SA.4.2	Saul’s son had two men who were captains of raiding bands. The name of one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is considered a part of Benjamin: 
2SA.4.3	and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until today). 
2SA.4.4	Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news came about Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse picked him up and fled. As she hurried to flee, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth. 
2SA.4.5	The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon. 
2SA.4.6	They came there into the middle of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. 
2SA.4.7	Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, killed him, beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night. 
2SA.4.8	They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life! The 
2SA.4.9	David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the 
2SA.4.10	when someone told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ thinking that he brought good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news. 
2SA.4.11	How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, should I not now require his blood from your hand, and rid the earth of you?” 
2SA.4.12	David commanded his young men, and they killed them, cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in Abner’s grave in Hebron.
2SA.5.1	Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and spoke, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. 
2SA.5.2	In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led Israel out and in. The 
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the 
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. 
2SA.5.5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. 
2SA.5.6	The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “The blind and the lame will keep you out of here;” thinking, “David can’t come in here.” 
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. This is David’s city. 
2SA.5.8	David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him go up to the watercourse and strike those lame and blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.”
2SA.5.9	David lived in the stronghold, and called it David’s city. David built around from Millo and inward. 
2SA.5.10	David grew greater and greater; for the 
2SA.5.11	Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, with cedar trees, carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house. 
2SA.5.12	David perceived that the 
2SA.5.13	David took more concubines and wives for himself out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David. 
2SA.5.14	These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold. 
2SA.5.18	Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.19	David enquired of the 
2SA.5.19	The 
2SA.5.20	David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there. Then he said, “The 
2SA.5.21	They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.
2SA.5.22	The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.23	When David enquired of the 
2SA.5.24	When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then stir yourself up; for then the 
2SA.5.25	David did so, as the 
2SA.6.1	David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 
2SA.6.2	David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Baale Judah, to bring up from there God’s ark, which is called by the Name, even the name of the 
2SA.6.3	They set God’s ark on a new cart, and brought it out of Abinadab’s house that was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart. 
2SA.6.4	They brought it out of Abinadab’s house, which was in the hill, with God’s ark; and Ahio went before the ark. 
2SA.6.5	David and all the house of Israel played before the 
2SA.6.6	When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached for God’s ark, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled. 
2SA.6.7	The 
2SA.6.8	David was displeased, because the 
2SA.6.9	David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	So David would not move the 
2SA.6.11	The 
2SA.6.12	King David was told, “The 
2SA.6.12	So David went and brought up God’s ark from the house of Obed-Edom into David’s city with joy. 
2SA.6.13	When those who bore the 
2SA.6.14	David danced before the 
2SA.6.15	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the 
2SA.6.16	As the 
2SA.6.17	They brought in the 
2SA.6.18	When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	He gave to all the people, even amongst the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a portion of bread, dates, and raisins. So all the people departed, each to his own house. 
2SA.6.20	Then David returned to bless his household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How glorious the king of Israel was today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servants’ maids, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!”
2SA.6.21	David said to Michal, “It was before the 
2SA.6.22	I will be yet more vile than this, and will be worthless in my own sight. But the maids of whom you have spoken will honour me.”
2SA.6.23	Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
2SA.7.1	When the king lived in his house, and the 
2SA.7.2	the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but God’s ark dwells within curtains.”
2SA.7.3	Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart; for the 
2SA.7.4	That same night, the 
2SA.7.5	“Go and tell my servant David, ‘The 
2SA.7.6	For I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought the children of Israel up out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle. 
2SA.7.7	In all places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel, did I say a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’ 
2SA.7.8	Now therefore tell my servant David this, ‘The 
2SA.7.9	I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. 
2SA.7.10	I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not afflict them any more, as at the first, 
2SA.7.11	and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover the 
2SA.7.12	When your days are fulfilled, and you sleep with your fathers, I will set up your offspring after you, who will proceed out of your body, and I will establish his kingdom. 
2SA.7.13	He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 
2SA.7.14	I will be his father, and he will be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; 
2SA.7.15	but my loving kindness will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you. 
2SA.7.16	Your house and your kingdom will be made sure forever before you. Your throne will be established forever.”’” 
2SA.7.17	Nathan spoke to David all these words, and according to all this vision.
2SA.7.18	Then David the king went in, and sat before the 
2SA.7.19	This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord GOD; but you have spoken also of your servant’s house for a great while to come; and this amongst men, Lord GOD! 
2SA.7.20	What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord GOD. 
2SA.7.21	For your word’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it. 
2SA.7.22	Therefore you are great, 
2SA.7.23	What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeemed to yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods? 
2SA.7.24	You established for yourself your people Israel to be your people forever; and you, 
2SA.7.25	Now, 
2SA.7.26	Let your name be magnified forever, saying, ‘The 
2SA.7.27	For you, 
2SA.7.28	“Now, O Lord GOD, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your servant. 
2SA.7.29	Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord GOD, have spoken it. Let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing.”
2SA.8.1	After this, David struck the Philistines and subdued them; and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines. 
2SA.8.2	He struck Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. The Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute. 
2SA.8.3	David also struck Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River. 
2SA.8.4	David took from him one thousand and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots. 
2SA.8.5	When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck twenty two thousand men of the Syrians. 
2SA.8.6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. The 
2SA.8.7	David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
2SA.8.8	From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took a great quantity of bronze. 
2SA.8.9	When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer, 
2SA.8.10	then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him; for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. Joram brought with him vessels of silver, vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze. 
2SA.8.11	King David also dedicated these to the 
2SA.8.12	of Syria, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, of the Philistines, of Amalek, and of the plunder of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
2SA.8.13	David earned a reputation when he returned from striking down eighteen thousand men of the Syrians in the Valley of Salt. 
2SA.8.14	He put garrisons in Edom. Throughout all Edom, he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. The 
2SA.8.15	David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness for all his people. 
2SA.8.16	Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder, 
2SA.8.17	Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, Seraiah was scribe, 
2SA.8.18	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David’s sons were chief ministers.
2SA.9.1	David said, “Is there yet any who is left of Saul’s house, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 
2SA.9.2	There was of Saul’s house a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?”
2SA.9.2	He said, “I am your servant.”
2SA.9.3	The king said, “Is there not yet any of Saul’s house, that I may show the kindness of God to him?”
2SA.9.3	Ziba said to the king, “Jonathan still has a son, who is lame in his feet.”
2SA.9.4	The king said to him, “Where is he?”
2SA.9.4	Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.”
2SA.9.5	Then king David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar. 
2SA.9.6	Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and showed respect. David said, “Mephibosheth.”
2SA.9.6	He answered, “Behold, your servant!”
2SA.9.7	David said to him, “Don’t be afraid; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father. You will eat bread at my table continually.”
2SA.9.8	He bowed down, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look at such a dead dog as I am?” 
2SA.9.9	Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s son. 
2SA.9.10	Till the land for him, you, your sons, and your servants. Bring in the harvest, that your master’s son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth your master’s son will always eat bread at my table.”
2SA.9.10	Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 
2SA.9.11	Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth ate at the king’s table, like one of the king’s sons. 
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in Ziba’s house were servants to Mephibosheth. 
2SA.9.13	So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king’s table. He was lame in both his feet.
2SA.10.1	After this, the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place. 
2SA.10.2	David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
2SA.10.3	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David honours your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn’t David sent his servants to you to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?”
2SA.10.4	So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. 
2SA.10.5	When they told David this, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”
2SA.10.6	When the children of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men. 
2SA.10.7	When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men. 
2SA.10.8	The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate. The Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field. 
2SA.10.9	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. 
2SA.10.10	The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon. 
2SA.10.11	He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you. 
2SA.10.12	Be courageous, and let’s be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and may the 
2SA.10.13	So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him. 
2SA.10.14	When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. 
2SA.10.15	When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together. 
2SA.10.16	Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head. 
2SA.10.17	David was told that; and he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. 
2SA.10.18	The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven hundred charioteers of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that he died there. 
2SA.10.19	When all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the children of Ammon any more.
2SA.11.1	At the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. 
2SA.11.2	At evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at. 
2SA.11.3	David sent and enquired after the woman. One said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, Uriah the Hittite’s wife?”
2SA.11.4	David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house. 
2SA.11.5	The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, “I am with child.”
2SA.11.6	David sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” Joab sent Uriah to David. 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah had come to him, David asked him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered. 
2SA.11.8	David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him. 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn’t go down to his house. 
2SA.11.10	When they had told David, saying, “Uriah didn’t go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go down to your house?”
2SA.11.11	Uriah said to David, “The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!”
2SA.11.12	David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day. 
2SA.11.13	When David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn’t go down to his house. 
2SA.11.14	In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. 
2SA.11.15	He wrote in the letter, saying, “Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.”
2SA.11.16	When Joab kept watch on the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were. 
2SA.11.17	The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of David’s servants; and Uriah the Hittite died also. 
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; 
2SA.11.19	and he commanded the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king, 
2SA.11.20	it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he asks you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they would shoot from the wall? 
2SA.11.21	Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’”
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for. 
2SA.11.23	The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate. 
2SA.11.24	The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.”
2SA.11.25	Then David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.’ Encourage him.”
2SA.11.26	When Uriah’s wife heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. 
2SA.11.27	When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the 
2SA.12.1	The 
2SA.12.2	The rich man had very many flocks and herds, 
2SA.12.3	but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter to him. 
2SA.12.4	A traveller came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to prepare for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”
2SA.12.5	David’s anger burnt hot against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As the 
2SA.12.6	He must restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!”
2SA.12.7	Nathan said to David, “You are the man. This is what the 
2SA.12.8	I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things. 
2SA.12.9	Why have you despised the 
2SA.12.10	Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken Uriah the Hittite’s wife to be your wife.’
2SA.12.11	“This is what the 
2SA.12.12	For you did this secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’”
2SA.12.13	David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.13	Nathan said to David, “The 
2SA.12.14	However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the 
2SA.12.15	Nathan departed to his house.
2SA.12.15	The 
2SA.12.16	David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the ground. 
2SA.12.17	The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, and he didn’t eat bread with them. 
2SA.12.18	On the seventh day, the child died. David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn’t listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?”
2SA.12.19	But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?”
2SA.12.19	They said, “He is dead.”
2SA.12.20	Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into the 
2SA.12.21	Then his servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread.”
2SA.12.22	He said, “While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether the 
2SA.12.23	But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”
2SA.12.24	David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. The 
2SA.12.25	and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah,
2SA.12.26	Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. 
2SA.12.27	Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters. 
2SA.12.28	Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called by my name.”
2SA.12.29	David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. 
2SA.12.30	He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent
2SA.12.31	He brought out the people who were in it, and put them under saws, under iron picks, under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln; and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.13.1	After this, Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. 
2SA.13.2	Amnon was so troubled that he became sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her. 
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man. 
2SA.13.4	He said to him, “Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won’t you tell me?”
2SA.13.4	Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”
2SA.13.5	Jonadab said to him, “Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.’”
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”
2SA.13.7	Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.” 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. She took dough, and kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes. 
2SA.13.9	She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, “Have all men leave me.” Then every man went out from him. 
2SA.13.10	Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.” Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother. 
2SA.13.11	When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister!”
2SA.13.12	She answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don’t you do this folly. 
2SA.13.13	As for me, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.”
2SA.13.14	However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her. 
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone!”
2SA.13.16	She said to him, “Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!”
2SA.13.16	But he would not listen to her. 
2SA.13.17	Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, “Now put this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.”
2SA.13.18	She had a garment of various colours on her; for the king’s daughters who were virgins dressed in such robes. Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her. 
2SA.13.19	Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colours that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went. 
2SA.13.20	Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.”
2SA.13.20	So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house. 
2SA.13.21	But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry. 
2SA.13.22	Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.23	After two full years, Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons. 
2SA.13.24	Absalom came to the king, and said, “See now, your servant has sheep shearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.”
2SA.13.25	The king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let’s not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.” He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him.
2SA.13.26	Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.”
2SA.13.26	The king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”
2SA.13.27	But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him. 
2SA.13.28	Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “Mark now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!”
2SA.13.29	The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled. 
2SA.13.30	While they were on the way, the news came to David, saying, “Absalom has slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left!”
2SA.13.31	Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn. 
2SA.13.32	Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered, “Don’t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. 
2SA.13.33	Now therefore don’t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for only Amnon is dead.” 
2SA.13.34	But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him. 
2SA.13.35	Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.” 
2SA.13.36	As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly. 
2SA.13.37	But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day. 
2SA.13.38	So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. 
2SA.13.39	King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.
2SA.14.1	Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was towards Absalom. 
2SA.14.2	Joab sent to Tekoa, and brought a wise woman from there, and said to her, “Please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, please, and don’t anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead. 
2SA.14.3	Go in to the king, and speak like this to him.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.
2SA.14.4	When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said, “Help, O king!”
2SA.14.5	The king said to her, “What ails you?”
2SA.14.5	She answered, “Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead. 
2SA.14.6	Your servant had two sons, and they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him. 
2SA.14.7	Behold, the whole family has risen against your servant, and they say, ‘Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.’ Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth.”
2SA.14.8	The king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.”
2SA.14.9	The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, may the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and may the king and his throne be guiltless.”
2SA.14.10	The king said, “Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you any more.”
2SA.14.11	Then she said, “Please let the king remember the 
2SA.14.11	He said, “As the 
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.”
2SA.14.12	He said, “Say on.”
2SA.14.13	The woman said, “Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one. 
2SA.14.14	For we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground, which can’t be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him. 
2SA.14.15	Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid. Your servant said, ‘I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.’ 
2SA.14.16	For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. 
2SA.14.17	Then your servant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. May the 
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered the woman, “Please don’t hide anything from me that I ask you.”
2SA.14.18	The woman said, “Let my lord the king now speak.”
2SA.14.19	The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?”
2SA.14.19	The woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab urged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your servant. 
2SA.14.20	Your servant Joab has done this thing to change the face of the matter. My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.”
2SA.14.21	The king said to Joab, “Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, and bring the young man Absalom back.”
2SA.14.22	Joab fell to the ground on his face, showed respect, and blessed the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favour in your sight, my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.”
2SA.14.23	So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	The king said, “Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, and didn’t see the king’s face. 
2SA.14.25	Now in all Israel there was no one to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty. From the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no defect in him. 
2SA.14.26	When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels,
2SA.14.27	Three sons were born to Absalom, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a woman with a beautiful face. 
2SA.14.28	Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and he didn’t see the king’s face. 
2SA.14.29	Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. Then he sent again a second time, but he would not come. 
2SA.14.30	Therefore he said to his servants, “Behold, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
2SA.14.31	Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”
2SA.14.32	Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.”’”
2SA.14.33	So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	After this, Absalom prepared a chariot and horses for himself, and fifty men to run before him. 
2SA.15.2	Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. When any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgement, then Absalom called to him, and said, “What city are you from?”
2SA.15.2	He said, “Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.”
2SA.15.3	Absalom said to him, “Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you.” 
2SA.15.4	Absalom said moreover, “Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!” 
2SA.15.5	It was so, that when any man came near to bow down to him, he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him. 
2SA.15.6	Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgement. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. 
2SA.15.7	At the end of forty years, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the 
2SA.15.8	For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If the 
2SA.15.9	The king said to him, “Go in peace.”
2SA.15.9	So he arose, and went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’”
2SA.15.11	Two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn’t know anything. 
2SA.15.12	Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. 
2SA.15.13	A messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.”
2SA.15.14	David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise! Let’s flee; or else none of us will escape from Absalom. Hurry to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”
2SA.15.15	The king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses.”
2SA.15.16	The king went out, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house. 
2SA.15.17	The king went out, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak. 
2SA.15.18	All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. 
2SA.15.19	Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to your own place. 
2SA.15.20	Whereas you came but yesterday, should I today make you go up and down with us, since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you.”
2SA.15.21	Ittai answered the king, and said, “As the 
2SA.15.22	David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him. 
2SA.15.23	All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over. The king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, towards the way of the wilderness. 
2SA.15.24	Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down God’s ark; and Abiathar went up, until all the people finished passing out of the city. 
2SA.15.25	The king said to Zadok, “Carry God’s ark back into the city. If I find favour in the 
2SA.15.26	but if he says, ‘I have no delight in you;’ behold, here I am. Let him do to me as seems good to him.” 
2SA.15.27	The king said also to Zadok the priest, “Aren’t you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 
2SA.15.28	Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me.” 
2SA.15.29	Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried God’s ark to Jerusalem again; and they stayed there. 
2SA.15.30	David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot. All the people who were with him each covered his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
2SA.15.31	Someone told David, saying, “Ahithophel is amongst the conspirators with Absalom.”
2SA.15.31	David said, “
2SA.15.32	When David had come to the top, where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his tunic torn, and earth on his head. 
2SA.15.33	David said to him, “If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me; 
2SA.15.34	but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father’s servant in time past, so I will now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.’ 
2SA.15.35	Don’t you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? Therefore whatever you hear out of the king’s house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 
2SA.15.36	Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son. Send to me everything that you shall hear by them.”
2SA.15.37	So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
2SA.16.1	When David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a container of wine. 
2SA.16.2	The king said to Ziba, “What do you mean by these?”
2SA.16.2	Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that those who are faint in the wilderness may drink.”
2SA.16.3	The king said, “Where is your master’s son?”
2SA.16.3	Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem; for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father.’”
2SA.16.4	Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.”
2SA.16.4	Ziba said, “I bow down. Let me find favour in your sight, my lord, O king.”
2SA.16.5	When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of Saul’s house came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out and cursed as he came. 
2SA.16.6	He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 
2SA.16.7	Shimei said when he cursed, “Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and wicked fellow! 
2SA.16.8	The 
2SA.16.9	Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.” 
2SA.16.10	The king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because the 
2SA.16.11	David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, “Behold, my son, who came out of my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for the 
2SA.16.12	It may be that the 
2SA.16.13	So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust. 
2SA.16.14	The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.
2SA.16.15	Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 
2SA.16.16	When Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, had come to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
2SA.16.17	Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?”
2SA.16.18	Hushai said to Absalom, “No; but whomever the 
2SA.16.19	Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn’t I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so I will be in your presence.”
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel what we shall do.”
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.”
2SA.16.22	So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. 
2SA.16.23	The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man enquired at the inner sanctuary of God. All the counsel of Ahithophel both was like this with David and with Absalom.
2SA.17.1	Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight. 
2SA.17.2	I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him will flee. I will strike the king only, 
2SA.17.3	and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace.”
2SA.17.4	The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. 
2SA.17.5	Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let’s hear likewise what he says.”
2SA.17.6	When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up.”
2SA.17.7	Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.” 
2SA.17.8	Hushai said moreover, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. 
2SA.17.9	Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter amongst the people who follow Absalom!’ 
2SA.17.10	Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men. 
2SA.17.11	But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person. 
2SA.17.12	So we will come on him in some place where he will be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground, then we will not leave so much as one of him and of all the men who are with him. 
2SA.17.13	Moreover, if he has gone into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn’t one small stone found there.”
2SA.17.14	Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For the 
2SA.17.15	Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Ahithophel counselled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counselled this way. 
2SA.17.16	Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, ‘Don’t lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.’”
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David. For they might not be seen to come into the city. 
2SA.17.18	But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there. 
2SA.17.19	The woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and spread out crushed grain on it; and nothing was known. 
2SA.17.20	Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
2SA.17.20	The woman said to them, “They have gone over the brook of water.”
2SA.17.20	When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. 
2SA.17.21	After they had departed, they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, “Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counselled against you.”
2SA.17.22	Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan. 
2SA.17.23	When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father. 
2SA.17.24	Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 
2SA.17.25	Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. 
2SA.17.26	Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead. 
2SA.17.27	When David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, 
2SA.17.28	brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted grain, 
2SA.17.29	honey, butter, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat; for they said, “The people are hungry, weary, and thirsty in the wilderness.”
2SA.18.1	David counted the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 
2SA.18.2	David sent the people out, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, “I will also surely go out with you myself.”
2SA.18.3	But the people said, “You shall not go out; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.”
2SA.18.4	The king said to them, “I will do what seems best to you.”
2SA.18.4	The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. 
2SA.18.5	The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.” All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.
2SA.18.6	So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	The people of Israel were struck there before David’s servants, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. 
2SA.18.8	For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. 
2SA.18.9	Absalom happened to meet David’s servants. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on. 
2SA.18.10	A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”
2SA.18.11	Joab said to the man who told him, “Behold, you saw it, and why didn’t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash.”
2SA.18.12	The man said to Joab, “Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.’ 
2SA.18.13	Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me.”
2SA.18.14	Then Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this with you.” He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak. 
2SA.18.15	Ten young men who bore Joab’s armour surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him. 
2SA.18.16	Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held the people back. 
2SA.18.17	They took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled, each to his own tent. 
2SA.18.18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king’s valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in memory.” He called the pillar after his own name. It is called Absalom’s monument, to this day.
2SA.18.19	Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me now run and carry the king news, how the 
2SA.18.20	Joab said to him, “You must not be the bearer of news today, but you must carry news another day. But today you must carry no news, because the king’s son is dead.”
2SA.18.21	Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen!” The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
2SA.18.22	Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, “But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.”
2SA.18.22	Joab said, “Why do you want to run, my son, since you will have no reward for the news?”
2SA.18.23	“But come what may,” he said, “I will run.”
2SA.18.23	He said to him, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.
2SA.18.24	Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone. 
2SA.18.25	The watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” He came closer and closer.
2SA.18.26	The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper, and said, “Behold, a man running alone!”
2SA.18.26	The king said, “He also brings news.”
2SA.18.27	The watchman said, “I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.”
2SA.18.27	The king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.”
2SA.18.28	Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, “All is well.” He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, “Blessed is the 
2SA.18.29	The king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?”
2SA.18.29	Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don’t know what it was.”
2SA.18.30	The king said, “Come and stand here.” He came, and stood still.
2SA.18.31	Behold, the Cushite came. The Cushite said, “News for my lord the king, for the 
2SA.18.32	The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?”
2SA.18.32	The Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is.”
2SA.18.33	The king was much moved, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he said, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.1	Joab was told, “Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.” 
2SA.19.2	The victory that day was turned into mourning amongst all the people; for the people heard it said that day, “The king grieves for his son.”
2SA.19.3	The people sneaked into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 
2SA.19.4	The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, “My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.5	Joab came into the house to the king, and said, “Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants, who today have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines; 
2SA.19.6	in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared today that princes and servants are nothing to you. For today I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and we had all died today, then it would have pleased you well. 
2SA.19.7	Now therefore arise, go out, and speak to comfort your servants; for I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” All the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent. 
2SA.19.9	All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. 
2SA.19.10	Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don’t you speak a word of bringing the king back?”
2SA.19.11	King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house. 
2SA.19.12	You are my brothers. You are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’ 
2SA.19.13	Say to Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren’t captain of the army before me continually instead of Joab.’” 
2SA.19.14	He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, “Return, you and all your servants.”
2SA.19.15	So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan. 
2SA.19.16	Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. 
2SA.19.17	There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of Saul’s house, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king. 
2SA.19.18	A ferry boat went to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he had come over the Jordan. 
2SA.19.19	He said to the king, “Don’t let my lord impute iniquity to me, or remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. 
2SA.19.20	For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore behold, I have come today as the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.”
2SA.19.21	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the 
2SA.19.22	David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should be adversaries to me today? Shall any man be put to death today in Israel? For don’t I know that I am king over Israel today?” 
2SA.19.23	The king said to Shimei, “You will not die.” The king swore to him.
2SA.19.24	Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace. 
2SA.19.25	When he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”
2SA.19.26	He answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, ‘I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go with the king,’ because your servant is lame. 
2SA.19.27	He has slandered your servant to my lord the king, but my lord the king is as an angel of God. Therefore do what is good in your eyes. 
2SA.19.28	For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant amongst those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?”
2SA.19.29	The king said to him, “Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Ziba divide the land.”
2SA.19.30	Mephibosheth said to the king, “Yes, let him take all, because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house.” 
2SA.19.31	Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan. 
2SA.19.32	Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old. He had provided the king with sustenance while he stayed at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. 
2SA.19.33	The king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.” 
2SA.19.34	Barzillai said to the king, “How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	I am eighty years old, today. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear the voice of singing men and singing women any more? Why then should your servant be a burden to my lord the king? 
2SA.19.36	Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward? 
2SA.19.37	Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.”
2SA.19.38	The king answered, “Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you. Whatever you request of me, that I will do for you.”
2SA.19.39	All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. Then the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place. 
2SA.19.40	So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him. All the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel. 
2SA.19.41	Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, “Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?”
2SA.19.42	All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? Or has he given us any gift?”
2SA.19.43	The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, “We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more claim to David than you. Why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?” The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
2SA.20.1	There happened to be there a wicked fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the trumpet, and said, “We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, Israel!”
2SA.20.2	So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem. 
2SA.20.3	David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but didn’t go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.
2SA.20.4	Then the king said to Amasa, “Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here present.”
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him. 
2SA.20.6	David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.”
2SA.20.7	Joab’s men went out after him, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.8	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went along it fell out. 
2SA.20.9	Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand. So he struck him with it in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn’t strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.11	One of Joab’s young men stood by him, and said, “He who favours Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab!”
2SA.20.12	Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still. 
2SA.20.13	When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.14	He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites. They were gathered together, and went also after him. 
2SA.20.15	They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down. 
2SA.20.16	Then a wise woman cried out of the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come near here, that I may speak with you.’” 
2SA.20.17	He came near to her; and the woman said, “Are you Joab?”
2SA.20.17	He answered, “I am.”
2SA.20.17	Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your servant.”
2SA.20.17	He answered, “I’m listening.”
2SA.20.18	Then she spoke, saying, “They used to say in old times, ‘They shall surely ask counsel at Abel;’ and so they settled a matter. 
2SA.20.19	I am amongst those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the 
2SA.20.20	Joab answered, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. 
2SA.20.21	The matter is not so. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Just deliver him, and I will depart from the city.”
2SA.20.21	The woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.”
2SA.20.22	Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king. 
2SA.20.23	Now Joab was over all the army of Israel, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites, 
2SA.20.24	Adoram was over the men subject to forced labour, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder, 
2SA.20.25	Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests, 
2SA.20.26	and Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.
2SA.21.1	There was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David sought the face of the 
2SA.21.2	The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the children of Israel had sworn to them; and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah); 
2SA.21.3	and David said to the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? And with what should I make atonement, that you may bless the 
2SA.21.4	The Gibeonites said to him, “It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.”
2SA.21.4	He said, “I will do for you whatever you say.”
2SA.21.5	They said to the king, “The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel, 
2SA.21.6	let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to the 
2SA.21.6	The king said, “I will give them.”
2SA.21.7	But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the 
2SA.21.8	But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 
2SA.21.9	He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the mountain before the 
2SA.21.10	Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water poured on them from the sky. She allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night. 
2SA.21.11	David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 
2SA.21.12	So David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa; 
2SA.21.13	and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son. They also gathered the bones of those who were hanged. 
2SA.21.14	They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer for the land.
2SA.21.15	The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. David grew faint; 
2SA.21.16	and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze in weight, he being armed with a new sword, thought he would kill David. 
2SA.21.17	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “Don’t go out with us to battle any more, so that you don’t quench the lamp of Israel.”
2SA.21.18	After this, there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant. 
2SA.21.19	There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite’s brother, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
2SA.21.20	There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on every hand, and six toes on every foot, twenty four in count; and he also was born to the giant. 
2SA.21.21	When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, killed him. 
2SA.21.22	These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
2SA.22.1	David spoke to the 
2SA.22.2	and he said:
2SA.22.2	“The 
2SA.22.2	my fortress,
2SA.22.2	and my deliverer, even mine;
2SA.22.3	God is my rock in whom I take refuge;
2SA.22.3	my shield, and the horn of my salvation,
2SA.22.3	my high tower, and my refuge.
2SA.22.3	My saviour, you save me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I call on the 
2SA.22.4	So shall I be saved from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	For the waves of death surrounded me.
2SA.22.5	The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
2SA.22.6	The cords of Sheol
2SA.22.6	The snares of death caught me.
2SA.22.7	In my distress, I called on the 
2SA.22.7	Yes, I called to my God.
2SA.22.7	He heard my voice out of his temple.
2SA.22.7	My cry came into his ears.
2SA.22.8	Then the earth shook and trembled.
2SA.22.8	The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken,
2SA.22.8	because he was angry.
2SA.22.9	Smoke went up out of his nostrils.
2SA.22.9	Consuming fire came out of his mouth.
2SA.22.9	Coals were kindled by it.
2SA.22.10	He bowed the heavens also, and came down.
2SA.22.10	Thick darkness was under his feet.
2SA.22.11	He rode on a cherub, and flew.
2SA.22.11	Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.
2SA.22.12	He made darkness a shelter around himself:
2SA.22.12	gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
2SA.22.13	At the brightness before him,
2SA.22.13	coals of fire were kindled.
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.14	The Most High uttered his voice.
2SA.22.15	He sent out arrows and scattered them,
2SA.22.15	lightning and confused them.
2SA.22.16	Then the channels of the sea appeared.
2SA.22.16	The foundations of the world were laid bare by the 
2SA.22.16	at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
2SA.22.17	He sent from on high and he took me.
2SA.22.17	He drew me out of many waters.
2SA.22.18	He delivered me from my strong enemy,
2SA.22.18	from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
2SA.22.19	They came on me in the day of my calamity,
2SA.22.19	but the 
2SA.22.20	He also brought me out into a large place.
2SA.22.20	He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
2SA.22.21	The 
2SA.22.21	He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the 
2SA.22.22	and have not wickedly departed from my God.
2SA.22.23	For all his ordinances were before me.
2SA.22.23	As for his statutes, I didn’t depart from them.
2SA.22.24	I was also perfect towards him.
2SA.22.24	I kept myself from my iniquity.
2SA.22.25	Therefore the 
2SA.22.25	According to my cleanness in his eyesight.
2SA.22.26	With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
2SA.22.26	With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect.
2SA.22.27	With the pure you will show yourself pure.
2SA.22.27	With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.
2SA.22.28	You will save the afflicted people,
2SA.22.28	But your eyes are on the arrogant, that you may bring them down.
2SA.22.29	For you are my lamp, 
2SA.22.29	The 
2SA.22.30	For by you, I run against a troop.
2SA.22.30	By my God, I leap over a wall.
2SA.22.31	As for God, his way is perfect.
2SA.22.31	The 
2SA.22.31	He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
2SA.22.32	For who is God, besides the 
2SA.22.32	Who is a rock, besides our God?
2SA.22.33	God is my strong fortress.
2SA.22.33	He makes my way perfect.
2SA.22.34	He makes his feet like hinds’ feet,
2SA.22.34	and sets me on my high places.
2SA.22.35	He teaches my hands to war,
2SA.22.35	so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.
2SA.22.36	You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
2SA.22.36	Your gentleness has made me great.
2SA.22.37	You have enlarged my steps under me.
2SA.22.37	My feet have not slipped.
2SA.22.38	I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them.
2SA.22.38	I didn’t turn again until they were consumed.
2SA.22.39	I have consumed them,
2SA.22.39	and struck them through,
2SA.22.39	so that they can’t arise.
2SA.22.39	Yes, they have fallen under my feet.
2SA.22.40	For you have armed me with strength for the battle.
2SA.22.40	You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
2SA.22.41	You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,
2SA.22.41	that I might cut off those who hate me.
2SA.22.42	They looked, but there was no one to save;
2SA.22.42	even to the 
2SA.22.43	Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth.
2SA.22.43	I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.
2SA.22.44	You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people.
2SA.22.44	You have kept me to be the head of the nations.
2SA.22.44	A people whom I have not known will serve me.
2SA.22.45	The foreigners will submit themselves to me.
2SA.22.45	As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.
2SA.22.46	The foreigners will fade away,
2SA.22.46	and will come trembling out of their close places.
2SA.22.47	The 
2SA.22.47	Blessed be my rock!
2SA.22.47	Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
2SA.22.48	even the God who executes vengeance for me,
2SA.22.48	who brings down peoples under me,
2SA.22.49	who brings me away from my enemies.
2SA.22.49	Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.
2SA.22.49	You deliver me from the violent man.
2SA.22.50	Therefore I will give thanks to you, 
2SA.22.50	and will sing praises to your name.
2SA.22.51	He gives great deliverance to his king,
2SA.22.51	and shows loving kindness to his anointed,
2SA.22.51	to David and to his offspring, forever more.”
2SA.23.1	Now these are the last words of David.
2SA.23.1	David the son of Jesse says,
2SA.23.1	the man who was raised on high says,
2SA.23.1	the anointed of the God of Jacob,
2SA.23.1	the sweet psalmist of Israel:
2SA.23.2	“The 
2SA.23.2	His word was on my tongue.
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel said,
2SA.23.3	the Rock of Israel spoke to me,
2SA.23.3	‘One who rules over men righteously,
2SA.23.3	who rules in the fear of God,
2SA.23.4	shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises,
2SA.23.4	a morning without clouds,
2SA.23.4	when the tender grass springs out of the earth,
2SA.23.4	through clear shining after rain.’
2SA.23.5	Isn’t my house so with God?
2SA.23.5	Yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant,
2SA.23.5	ordered in all things, and sure,
2SA.23.5	for it is all my salvation and all my desire,
2SA.23.5	although he doesn’t make it grow.
2SA.23.6	But all the ungodly will be as thorns to be thrust away,
2SA.23.6	because they can’t be taken with the hand.
2SA.23.7	The man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear.
2SA.23.7	They will be utterly burnt with fire in their place.”
2SA.23.8	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; he was called Adino the Eznite, who killed eight hundred at one time. 
2SA.23.9	After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away. 
2SA.23.10	He arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and the 
2SA.23.11	After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines had gathered together into a troop, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines. 
2SA.23.12	But he stood in the middle of the plot and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the 
2SA.23.13	Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.23.14	David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. 
2SA.23.15	David longed, and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”
2SA.23.16	The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David; but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to the 
2SA.23.17	He said, “Be it far from me, 
2SA.23.18	Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name amongst the three. 
2SA.23.19	Wasn’t he most honourable of the three? Therefore he was made their captain. However he wasn’t included as one of the three. 
2SA.23.20	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit in a time of snow. 
2SA.23.21	He killed a huge Egyptian, and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear. 
2SA.23.22	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name amongst the three mighty men. 
2SA.23.23	He was more honourable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three. David set him over his guard. 
2SA.23.24	Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty: Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
2SA.23.25	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, 
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, 
2SA.23.27	Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 
2SA.23.29	Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, 
2SA.23.30	Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash. 
2SA.23.31	Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 
2SA.23.32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 
2SA.23.33	Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite, 
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 
2SA.23.35	Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, 
2SA.23.36	Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
2SA.23.37	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armour bearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
2SA.23.38	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
2SA.23.39	and Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.
2SA.24.1	Again the 
2SA.24.2	The king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him, “Now go back and forth through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and count the people, that I may know the sum of the people.”
2SA.24.3	Joab said to the king, “Now may the 
2SA.24.4	Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel. 
2SA.24.5	They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer; 
2SA.24.6	then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon, 
2SA.24.7	and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba. 
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
2SA.24.9	Joab gave up the sum of the counting of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men. 
2SA.24.10	David’s heart struck him after he had counted the people. David said to the 
2SA.24.11	When David rose up in the morning, the 
2SA.24.12	“Go and speak to David, ‘The 
2SA.24.13	So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.”
2SA.24.14	David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let us fall now into the 
2SA.24.15	So the 
2SA.24.16	When the angel stretched out his hand towards Jerusalem to destroy it, the 
2SA.24.17	David spoke to the 
2SA.24.18	Gad came that day to David, and said to him, “Go up, build an altar to the 
2SA.24.19	David went up according to the saying of Gad, as the 
2SA.24.20	Araunah looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on towards him. Then Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
2SA.24.21	Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”
2SA.24.21	David said, “To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to the 
2SA.24.22	Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. 
2SA.24.23	All this, O king, does Araunah give to the king.” Araunah said to the king, “May the 
2SA.24.24	The king said to Araunah, “No; but I will most certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the 
2SA.24.25	David built an altar to the 
1KI.1.1	Now king David was old and advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn’t keep warm. 
1KI.1.2	Therefore his servants said to him, “Let a young virgin be sought for my lord the king. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.” 
1KI.1.3	So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and served him; but the king didn’t know her intimately.
1KI.1.5	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” Then he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
1KI.1.6	His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, “Why have you done so?” and he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom. 
1KI.1.7	He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they followed Adonijah and helped him. 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. 
1KI.1.9	Adonijah killed sheep, cattle, and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants; 
1KI.1.10	but he didn’t call Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother. 
1KI.1.11	Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Haven’t you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn’t know it? 
1KI.1.12	Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and your son Solomon’s life. 
1KI.1.13	Go in to king David, and tell him, ‘Didn’t you, my lord, king, swear to your servant, saying, “Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?” Why then does Adonijah reign?’ 
1KI.1.14	Behold,
1KI.1.15	Bathsheba went in to the king in his room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king. 
1KI.1.16	Bathsheba bowed, and showed respect to the king. The king said, “What would you like?”
1KI.1.17	She said to him, “My lord, you swore by the 
1KI.1.18	Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, don’t know it. 
1KI.1.19	He has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn’t called Solomon your servant. 
1KI.1.20	You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
1KI.1.21	Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered criminals.”
1KI.1.22	Behold, while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 
1KI.1.23	They told the king, saying, “Behold, Nathan the prophet!”
1KI.1.23	When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
1KI.1.24	Nathan said, “My lord, king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?’ 
1KI.1.25	For he has gone down today, and has slain cattle, fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king’s sons, the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, ‘Long live king Adonijah!’ 
1KI.1.26	But he hasn’t called me, even me your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.27	Was this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven’t shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”
1KI.1.28	Then king David answered, “Call Bathsheba in to me.” She came into the king’s presence and stood before the king. 
1KI.1.29	The king swore, and said, “As the 
1KI.1.30	most certainly as I swore to you by the 
1KI.1.31	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and showed respect to the king, and said, “Let my lord king David live forever!”
1KI.1.32	King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” They came before the king. 
1KI.1.33	The king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. 
1KI.1.34	Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. Blow the trumpet, and say, ‘Long live king Solomon!’ 
1KI.1.35	Then come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.”
1KI.1.36	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, “Amen. May the 
1KI.1.37	As the 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. 
1KI.1.39	Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the Tent, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet; and all the people said, “Long live king Solomon!”
1KI.1.40	All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with their sound. 
1KI.1.41	Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?”
1KI.1.42	While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said, “Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.”
1KI.1.43	Jonathan answered Adonijah, “Most certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king. 
1KI.1.44	The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king’s mule. 
1KI.1.45	Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. They have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard. 
1KI.1.46	Also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom. 
1KI.1.47	Moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne;’ and the king bowed himself on the bed. 
1KI.1.48	Also thus said the king, ‘Blessed be the 
1KI.1.49	All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way. 
1KI.1.50	Adonijah was afraid because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and hung onto the horns of the altar. 
1KI.1.51	Solomon was told, “Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for, behold, he is hanging onto the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’”
1KI.1.52	Solomon said, “If he shows himself a worthy man, not a hair of his shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.”
1KI.1.53	So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”
1KI.2.1	Now the days of David came near that he should die; and he commanded Solomon his son, saying, 
1KI.2.2	“I am going the way of all the earth. You be strong therefore, and show yourself a man; 
1KI.2.3	and keep the instruction of the 
1KI.2.4	Then the 
1KI.2.5	“Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his sash that was around his waist, and in his sandals that were on his feet. 
1KI.2.6	Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don’t let his grey head go down to Sheol
1KI.2.7	But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be amongst those who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.
1KI.2.8	“Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the 
1KI.2.9	Now therefore don’t hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his grey head down to Sheol
1KI.2.10	David slept with his fathers, and was buried in David’s city. 
1KI.2.11	The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
1KI.2.12	Solomon sat on David his father’s throne; and his kingdom was firmly established.
1KI.2.13	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said, “Do you come peaceably?”
1KI.2.13	He said, “Peaceably. 
1KI.2.14	He said moreover, I have something to tell you.”
1KI.2.14	She said, “Say on.”
1KI.2.15	He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. However the kingdom is turned around, and has become my brother’s; for it was his from the 
1KI.2.16	Now I ask one petition of you. Don’t deny me.”
1KI.2.16	She said to him, “Say on.” 
1KI.2.17	He said, “Please speak to Solomon the king (for he will not tell you ‘no’), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.”
1KI.2.18	Bathsheba said, “All right. I will speak for you to the king.”
1KI.2.19	Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand. 
1KI.2.20	Then she said, “I ask one small petition of you; don’t deny me.”
1KI.2.20	The king said to her, “Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you.”
1KI.2.21	She said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.”
1KI.2.22	King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.” 
1KI.2.23	Then king Solomon swore by the 
1KI.2.24	Now therefore as the 
1KI.2.25	King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died. 
1KI.2.26	To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the Lord
1KI.2.27	So Solomon thrust Abiathar out from being priest to the 
1KI.2.28	This news came to Joab; for Joab had followed Adonijah, although he didn’t follow Absalom. Joab fled to the 
1KI.2.29	King Solomon was told, “Joab has fled to the 
1KI.2.30	Benaiah came to the 
1KI.2.30	He said, “No; but I will die here.”
1KI.2.30	Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, “This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.”
1KI.2.31	The king said to him, “Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house. 
1KI.2.32	The 
1KI.2.33	So their blood will return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his offspring
1KI.2.34	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 
1KI.2.35	The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar. 
1KI.2.36	The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and live there, and don’t go anywhere else. 
1KI.2.37	For on the day you go out and pass over the brook Kidron, know for certain that you will surely die. Your blood will be on your own head.”
1KI.2.38	Shimei said to the king, “What you say is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.
1KI.2.39	At the end of three years, two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, “Behold, your slaves are in Gath.”
1KI.2.40	Shimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his slaves; and Shimei went, and brought his slaves from Gath. 
1KI.2.41	Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.
1KI.2.42	The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Didn’t I adjure you by the 
1KI.2.43	Why then have you not kept the oath of the 
1KI.2.44	The king said moreover to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the wickedness that you did to David my father. Therefore the 
1KI.2.45	But king Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will be established before the 
1KI.2.46	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
1KI.3.1	Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into David’s city, until he had finished building his own house, the 
1KI.3.2	However the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was not yet a house built for the 
1KI.3.3	Solomon loved the 
1KI.3.4	The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. 
1KI.3.5	In Gibeon, the 
1KI.3.6	Solomon said, “You have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, because he walked before you in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you. You have kept for him this great loving kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today. 
1KI.3.7	Now, 
1KI.3.8	Your servant is amongst your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can’t be numbered or counted for multitude. 
1KI.3.9	Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this great people of yours?”
1KI.3.10	This request pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. 
1KI.3.11	God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have you asked for riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice; 
1KI.3.12	behold, I have done according to your word. Behold, I have given you a wise and understanding heart; so that there has been no one like you before you, and after you none will arise like you. 
1KI.3.13	I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honour, so that there will not be any amongst the kings like you for all your days. 
1KI.3.14	If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”
1KI.3.15	Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the 
1KI.3.16	Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king, and stood before him. 
1KI.3.17	The one woman said, “Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. I delivered a child with her in the house. 
1KI.3.18	The third day after I delivered, this woman delivered also. We were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, just us two in the house. 
1KI.3.19	This woman’s child died in the night, because she lay on it. 
1KI.3.20	She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your servant slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 
1KI.3.21	When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore.”
1KI.3.22	The other woman said, “No; but the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.”
1KI.3.22	The first one said, “No; but the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son.” They argued like this before the king.
1KI.3.23	Then the king said, “One says, ‘This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead;’ and the other says, ‘No; but your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.’”
1KI.3.24	The king said, “Get me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king.
1KI.3.25	The king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.”
1KI.3.26	Then the woman whose the living child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill him!”
1KI.3.26	But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours. Divide him.”
1KI.3.27	Then the king answered, “Give her the living child, and definitely do not kill him. She is his mother.”
1KI.3.28	All Israel heard of the judgement which the king had judged; and they feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.
1KI.4.1	King Solomon was king over all Israel. 
1KI.4.2	These were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; 
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; 
1KI.4.4	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 
1KI.4.5	Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, the king’s friend; 
1KI.4.6	Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced labour.
1KI.4.7	Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household. Each man had to make provision for a month in the year. 
1KI.4.8	These are their names: Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim; 
1KI.4.9	Ben Deker, in Makaz, in Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan; 
1KI.4.10	Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (Socoh and all the land of Hepher belonged to him); 
1KI.4.11	Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath, Solomon’s daughter, as wife); 
1KI.4.12	Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam; 
1KI.4.13	Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, belonged to him; and the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars, belonged to him); 
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; 
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife); 
1KI.4.16	Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; 
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; 
1KI.4.18	Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; 
1KI.4.19	Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the land.
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel were numerous as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry. 
1KI.4.21	Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life. 
1KI.4.22	Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty cors
1KI.4.23	ten head of fat cattle, twenty head of cattle out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep, in addition to deer, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fattened fowl. 
1KI.4.24	For he had dominion over all on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides around him. 
1KI.4.25	Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 
1KI.4.26	Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
1KI.4.27	Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon’s table, every man in his month. They let nothing be lacking. 
1KI.4.28	They also brought Barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where the officers were, each man according to his duty. 
1KI.4.29	God gave Solomon abundant wisdom and understanding, and very great understanding, even as the sand that is on the seashore. 
1KI.4.30	Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
1KI.4.31	For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations all around. 
1KI.4.32	He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs numbered one thousand and five. 
1KI.4.33	He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows out of the wall; he also spoke of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish. 
1KI.4.34	People of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, sent by all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
1KI.5.1	Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father, and Hiram had always loved David. 
1KI.5.2	Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 
1KI.5.3	“You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the 
1KI.5.4	But now the 
1KI.5.5	Behold, I intend to build a house for the name of the 
1KI.5.6	Now therefore command that cedar trees be cut for me out of Lebanon. My servants will be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you say. For you know that there is nobody amongst us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”
1KI.5.7	When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed is the 
1KI.5.8	Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message which you have sent to me. I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning cypress timber. 
1KI.5.9	My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you specify to me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and you will receive them. You will accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.”
1KI.5.10	So Hiram gave Solomon cedar timber and cypress timber according to all his desire. 
1KI.5.11	Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors
1KI.5.12	The 
1KI.5.13	King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 
1KI.5.14	He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; for a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labour. 
1KI.5.15	Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains; 
1KI.5.16	besides Solomon’s chief officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who ruled over the people who laboured in the work. 
1KI.5.17	The king commanded, and they cut out large stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone. 
1KI.5.18	Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.
1KI.6.1	In the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, he began to build the 
1KI.6.2	The house which king Solomon built for the 
1KI.6.3	The porch in front of the temple of the house had a length of twenty cubits, which was along the width of the house. Ten cubits was its width in front of the house. 
1KI.6.4	He made windows of fixed lattice work for the house. 
1KI.6.5	Against the wall of the house, he built floors all around, against the walls of the house all around, both of the temple and of the inner sanctuary; and he made side rooms all around. 
1KI.6.6	The lowest floor was five cubits wide, and the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around, that the beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house. 
1KI.6.7	The house, when it was under construction, was built of stone prepared at the quarry; and no hammer or axe or any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was under construction. 
1KI.6.8	The door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house. They went up by winding stairs into the middle floor, and out of the middle into the third. 
1KI.6.9	So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar. 
1KI.6.10	He built the floors all along the house, each five cubits high; and they rested on the house with timbers of cedar.
1KI.6.11	The 
1KI.6.12	“Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father. 
1KI.6.13	I will dwell amongst the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.”
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 
1KI.6.15	He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with cypress boards. 
1KI.6.16	He built twenty cubits on the back part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling. He built them for it within, for an inner sanctuary, even for the most holy place. 
1KI.6.17	In front of the temple sanctuary was forty cubits. 
1KI.6.18	There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and open flowers. All was cedar. No stone was visible. 
1KI.6.19	He prepared an inner sanctuary in the middle of the house within, to set the ark of the 
1KI.6.20	Within the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in its height; and he overlaid it with pure gold; and he covered the altar with cedar. 
1KI.6.21	So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold. He drew chains of gold across before the inner sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold. 
1KI.6.22	He overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. He also overlaid the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary with gold. 
1KI.6.23	In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim
1KI.6.24	Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub. From the tip of one wing to the tip of the other was ten cubits. 
1KI.6.25	The other cherub was ten cubits. Both the cherubim were of one measure and one form. 
1KI.6.26	One cherub was ten cubits high, and so was the other cherub. 
1KI.6.27	He set the cherubim within the inner house. The wings of the cherubim were stretched out, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the middle of the house. 
1KI.6.28	He overlaid the cherubim with gold. 
1KI.6.29	He carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, inside and outside. 
1KI.6.30	He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, inside and outside. 
1KI.6.31	For the entrance of the inner sanctuary, he made doors of olive wood. The lintel and door posts were a fifth part of the wall. 
1KI.6.32	So he made two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold. He spread the gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees. 
1KI.6.33	He also did so for the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part of the wall; 
1KI.6.34	and two doors of cypress wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. 
1KI.6.35	He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work. 
1KI.6.36	He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and a course of cedar beams. 
1KI.6.37	The foundation of the 
1KI.6.38	In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all its parts, and according to all its specifications. So he spent seven years building it.
1KI.7.1	Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. 
1KI.7.2	For he built the House of the Forest of Lebanon. Its length was one hundred cubits,
1KI.7.3	It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars, fifteen in a row. 
1KI.7.4	There were beams in three rows, and window was facing window in three ranks. 
1KI.7.5	All the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was facing window in three ranks. 
1KI.7.6	He made the porch of pillars. Its length was fifty cubits and its width thirty cubits; with a porch before them, and pillars and a threshold before them. 
1KI.7.7	He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgement; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor. 
1KI.7.8	His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch. 
1KI.7.9	All these were of costly stones, even of cut stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court. 
1KI.7.10	The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 
1KI.7.11	Above were costly stones, even cut stone, according to measure, and cedar wood. 
1KI.7.12	The great court around had three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams; like the inner court of the 
1KI.7.13	King Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre. 
1KI.7.14	He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in bronze. He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work. 
1KI.7.15	For he fashioned the two pillars of bronze, eighteen cubits high apiece; and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them. 
1KI.7.16	He made two capitals of molten bronze, to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. 
1KI.7.17	There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital. 
1KI.7.18	So he made the pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and he did so for the other capital. 
1KI.7.19	The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits. 
1KI.7.20	There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network. There were two hundred pomegranates in rows around the other capital. 
1KI.7.21	He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple. He set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz. 
1KI.7.22	On the top of the pillars was lily work: so the work of the pillars was finished. 
1KI.7.23	He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in shape. Its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it. 
1KI.7.24	Under its brim around there were buds which encircled it for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast. 
1KI.7.25	It stood on twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward. 
1KI.7.26	It was a hand width thick. Its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths. 
1KI.7.27	He made the ten bases of bronze. The length of one base was four cubits, four cubits its width, and three cubits its height. 
1KI.7.28	The work of the bases was like this: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges; 
1KI.7.29	and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work. 
1KI.7.30	Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of bronze; and the four feet of it had supports. The supports were cast beneath the basin, with wreaths at the side of each. 
1KI.7.31	Its mouth within the capital and above was a cubit. Its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth were engravings, and their panels were square, not round. 
1KI.7.32	The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base. The height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. 
1KI.7.33	The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel. Their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all of cast metal. 
1KI.7.34	There were four supports at the four corners of each base. Its supports were of the base itself. 
1KI.7.35	In the top of the base there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its supports and its panels were the same. 
1KI.7.36	On the plates of its supports, and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, each in its space, with wreaths all around. 
1KI.7.37	He made the ten bases in this way: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form. 
1KI.7.38	He made ten basins of bronze. One basin contained forty baths;
1KI.7.39	He set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward and towards the south. 
1KI.7.40	Hiram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the 
1KI.7.41	the two pillars; the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; 
1KI.7.42	the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars; 
1KI.7.43	the ten bases; the ten basins on the bases; 
1KI.7.44	the one sea; the twelve oxen under the sea; 
1KI.7.45	the pots; the shovels; and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the 
1KI.7.46	The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 
1KI.7.47	Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them. The weight of the bronze could not be determined. 
1KI.7.48	Solomon made all the vessels that were in the 
1KI.7.49	and the lamp stands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; 
1KI.7.50	the cups, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold. 
1KI.7.51	Thus all the work that king Solomon did in the 
1KI.8.1	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, with all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the 
1KI.8.2	All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. 
1KI.8.3	All the elders of Israel came, and the priests picked up the ark. 
1KI.8.4	They brought up the 
1KI.8.5	King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted or numbered for multitude. 
1KI.8.6	The priests brought in the ark of the 
1KI.8.7	For the cherubim spread their wings out over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above. 
1KI.8.8	The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary; but they were not seen outside. They are there to this day. 
1KI.8.9	There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, when the 
1KI.8.10	It came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the 
1KI.8.11	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the 
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon said, “The 
1KI.8.13	I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.”
1KI.8.14	The king turned his face around, and blessed all the assembly of Israel; and all the assembly of Israel stood. 
1KI.8.15	He said, “Blessed is the 
1KI.8.16	‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.’
1KI.8.17	“Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the 
1KI.8.18	But the 
1KI.8.19	Nevertheless, you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.’ 
1KI.8.20	The 
1KI.8.21	There I have set a place for the ark, in which is the 
1KI.8.22	Solomon stood before the 
1KI.8.23	and he said, “
1KI.8.24	who has kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is today. 
1KI.8.25	Now therefore, may 
1KI.8.26	“Now therefore, God of Israel, please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father. 
1KI.8.27	But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain you; how much less this house that I have built! 
1KI.8.28	Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and for his supplication, 
1KI.8.29	that your eyes may be open towards this house night and day, even towards the place of which you have said, ‘My name shall be there;’ to listen to the prayer which your servant prays towards this place. 
1KI.8.30	Listen to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they pray towards this place. Yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.
1KI.8.31	“If a man sins against his neighbour, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house; 
1KI.8.32	then hear in heaven, and act, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
1KI.8.33	“When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; if they turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you in this house; 
1KI.8.34	then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers.
1KI.8.35	“When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray towards this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them, 
1KI.8.36	then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
1KI.8.37	“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight, mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there is; 
1KI.8.38	whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall each know the plague of his own heart, and spread out his hands towards this house, 
1KI.8.39	then hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive, and act, and give to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men); 
1KI.8.40	that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.
1KI.8.41	“Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he comes out of a far country for your name’s sake 
1KI.8.42	(for they shall hear of your great name, and of your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm); when he comes and prays towards this house; 
1KI.8.43	hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.
1KI.8.44	“If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to the 
1KI.8.45	then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 
1KI.8.46	If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn’t sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near; 
1KI.8.47	yet if they repent in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive, saying, ‘We have sinned, and have done perversely; we have dealt wickedly;’ 
1KI.8.48	if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to you towards their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name; 
1KI.8.49	then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven, your dwelling place, and maintain their cause; 
1KI.8.50	and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them 
1KI.8.51	(for they are your people, and your inheritance, which you brought out of Egypt, from the middle of the iron furnace); 
1KI.8.52	that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you. 
1KI.8.53	For you separated them from amongst all the peoples of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke by Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord GOD.”
1KI.8.54	It was so, that when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication to the 
1KI.8.55	He stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 
1KI.8.56	“Blessed be the 
1KI.8.57	May the 
1KI.8.58	that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers. 
1KI.8.59	Let these my words, with which I have made supplication before the 
1KI.8.60	that all the peoples of the earth may know that the 
1KI.8.61	“Let your heart therefore be perfect with the 
1KI.8.62	The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the 
1KI.8.63	Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the 
1KI.8.64	The same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before the 
1KI.8.65	So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before the 
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad in their hearts for all the goodness that the 
1KI.9.1	When Solomon had finished the building of the 
1KI.9.2	The 
1KI.9.3	The 
1KI.9.4	As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances; 
1KI.9.5	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised to David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail from you a man on the throne of Israel.’ 
1KI.9.6	But if you turn away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them; 
1KI.9.7	then I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and I will cast this house, which I have made holy for my name, out of my sight; and Israel will be a proverb and a byword amongst all peoples. 
1KI.9.8	Though this house is so high, yet everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss; and they will say, ‘Why has the 
1KI.9.9	and they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the 
1KI.9.10	At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the 
1KI.9.11	(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and cypress trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 
1KI.9.12	Hiram came out of Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they didn’t please him. 
1KI.9.13	He said, “What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?” He called them the land of Cabul
1KI.9.14	Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents
1KI.9.15	This is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the 
1KI.9.16	Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, taken Gezer, burnt it with fire, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it for a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. 
1KI.9.17	Solomon built in the land Gezer, Beth Horon the lower, 
1KI.9.18	Baalath, Tamar in the wilderness, 
1KI.9.19	all the storage cities that Solomon had, the cities for his chariots, the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 
1KI.9.20	As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel; 
1KI.9.21	their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day. 
1KI.9.22	But of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants; but they were the men of war, his servants, his princes, his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. 
1KI.9.23	These were the five hundred and fifty chief officers who were over Solomon’s work, who ruled over the people who laboured in the work. 
1KI.9.24	But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of David’s city to her house which Solomon had built for her. Then he built Millo. 
1KI.9.25	Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the 
1KI.9.26	King Solomon made a fleet of ships in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. 
1KI.9.27	Hiram sent in the fleet his servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 
1KI.9.28	They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents,
1KI.10.1	When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the 
1KI.10.2	She came to Jerusalem with a very great caravan, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious stones; and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him about all that was in her heart. 
1KI.10.3	Solomon answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything hidden from the king which he didn’t tell her. 
1KI.10.4	When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, 
1KI.10.5	the food of his table, the sitting of his servants, the attendance of his officials, their clothing, his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the 
1KI.10.6	She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom. 
1KI.10.7	However I didn’t believe the words until I came and my eyes had seen it. Behold, not even half was told me! Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard. 
1KI.10.8	Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, who hear your wisdom. 
1KI.10.9	Blessed is the 
1KI.10.10	She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again was there such an abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
1KI.10.11	The fleet of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir, also brought in from Ophir great quantities of almug trees
1KI.10.12	The king made of the almug trees pillars for the 
1KI.10.13	King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, in addition to that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants. 
1KI.10.14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents
1KI.10.15	in addition to that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mixed people, and of the governors of the country. 
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels
1KI.10.17	he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas
1KI.10.18	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. 
1KI.10.19	There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were armrests on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests. 
1KI.10.20	Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps. Nothing like it was made in any kingdom. 
1KI.10.21	All king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver, because it was considered of little value in the days of Solomon. 
1KI.10.22	For the king had a fleet of Tarshish at sea with Hiram’s fleet. Once every three years the fleet of Tarshish came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. 
1KI.10.23	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. 
1KI.10.24	All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
1KI.10.25	Year after year, every man brought his tribute, vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, armour, spices, horses, and mules. 
1KI.10.26	Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he kept in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem. 
1KI.10.27	The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedars as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland. 
1KI.10.28	The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt. The king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price. 
1KI.10.29	A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels
1KI.11.1	Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites; 
1KI.11.2	of the nations concerning which the 
1KI.11.3	He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. His wives turned his heart away. 
1KI.11.4	When Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with the 
1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.6	Solomon did that which was evil in the 
1KI.11.7	Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon. 
1KI.11.8	So he did for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods. 
1KI.11.9	The 
1KI.11.10	and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he didn’t keep that which the 
1KI.11.11	Therefore the 
1KI.11.12	Nevertheless, I will not do it in your days, for David your father’s sake; but I will tear it out of your son’s hand. 
1KI.11.13	However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.”
1KI.11.14	The 
1KI.11.15	For when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army had gone up to bury the slain, and had struck every male in Edom 
1KI.11.16	(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom); 
1KI.11.17	Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt, when Hadad was still a little child. 
1KI.11.18	They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him food, and gave him land. 
1KI.11.19	Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 
1KI.11.20	The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house amongst the sons of Pharaoh. 
1KI.11.21	When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.”
1KI.11.22	Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own country?”
1KI.11.22	He answered, “Nothing, however only let me depart.”
1KI.11.23	God raised up an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah. 
1KI.11.24	He gathered men to himself, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them of Zobah. They went to Damascus, and lived there, and reigned in Damascus. 
1KI.11.25	He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, in addition to the mischief of Hadad. He abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria. 
1KI.11.26	Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king. 
1KI.11.27	This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of his father David’s city. 
1KI.11.28	The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he put him in charge of all the labour of the house of Joseph. 
1KI.11.29	At that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the way. Now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and the two of them were alone in the field. 
1KI.11.30	Ahijah took the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces. 
1KI.11.31	He said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces; for the 
1KI.11.32	(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel); 
1KI.11.33	because they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon. They have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my ordinances, as David his father did.
1KI.11.34	“‘However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes; 
1KI.11.35	but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes. 
1KI.11.36	I will give one tribe to his son, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for myself to put my name there. 
1KI.11.37	I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel. 
1KI.11.38	It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you. 
1KI.11.39	I will afflict the offspring of David for this, but not forever.’”
1KI.11.40	Therefore Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. 
1KI.11.41	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren’t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon? 
1KI.11.42	The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. 
1KI.11.43	Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in his father David’s city; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
1KI.12.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt, 
1KI.12.3	and they sent and called him), Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
1KI.12.4	“Your father made our yoke difficult. Now therefore make the hard service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.”
1KI.12.5	He said to them, “Depart for three days, then come back to me.”
1KI.12.5	So the people departed.
1KI.12.6	King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, “What counsel do you give me to answer these people?”
1KI.12.7	They replied, “If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them, and answer them with good words, then they will be your servants forever.”
1KI.12.8	But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. 
1KI.12.9	He said to them, “What counsel do you give, that we may answer these people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’”
1KI.12.10	The young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Tell these people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter to us;’ tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. 
1KI.12.11	Now my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’”
1KI.12.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.” 
1KI.12.13	The king answered the people roughly, and abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, 
1KI.12.14	and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”
1KI.12.15	So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about from the 
1KI.12.16	When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion have we in David? We don’t have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So Israel departed to their tents.
1KI.12.17	But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
1KI.12.18	Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labour; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam hurried to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
1KI.12.19	So Israel rebelled against David’s house to this day. 
1KI.12.20	When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. There was no one who followed David’s house, except for the tribe of Judah only. 
1KI.12.21	When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
1KI.12.22	But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
1KI.12.23	“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying, 
1KI.12.24	‘The 
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived in it; and he went out from there, and built Penuel. 
1KI.12.26	Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom will return to David’s house. 
1KI.12.27	If this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the 
1KI.12.28	So the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Look and behold your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt!” 
1KI.12.29	He set the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. 
1KI.12.30	This thing became a sin; for the people went even as far as Dan to worship before the one there. 
1KI.12.31	He made houses of high places, and made priests from amongst all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi. 
1KI.12.32	Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar. He did so in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made, and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made. 
1KI.12.33	He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense.
1KI.13.1	Behold, a man of God came out of Judah by the 
1KI.13.2	He cried against the altar by the 
1KI.13.3	He gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign which the 
1KI.13.4	When the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam put out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” His hand, which he put out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to himself. 
1KI.13.5	The altar was also split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the 
1KI.13.6	The king answered the man of God, “Now intercede for the favour of the 
1KI.13.6	The man of God interceded with the 
1KI.13.7	The king said to the man of God, “Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”
1KI.13.8	The man of God said to the king, “Even if you gave me half of your house, I would not go in with you, neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place; 
1KI.13.9	for so was it commanded me by the 
1KI.13.10	So he went another way, and didn’t return by the way that he came to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	Now an old prophet lived in Bethel, and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king.
1KI.13.12	Their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who came from Judah. 
1KI.13.13	He said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it. 
1KI.13.14	He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. He said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?”
1KI.13.14	He said, “I am.” 
1KI.13.15	Then he said to him, “Come home with me, and eat bread.”
1KI.13.16	He said, “I may not return with you, nor go in with you. I will not eat bread or drink water with you in this place. 
1KI.13.17	For it was said to me by the 
1KI.13.18	He said to him, “I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the 
1KI.13.19	So he went back with him, ate bread in his house, and drank water. 
1KI.13.20	As they sat at the table, the 
1KI.13.21	and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “The 
1KI.13.22	but came back, and have eaten bread and drank water in the place of which he said to you, “Eat no bread, and drink no water;” your body will not come to the tomb of your fathers.’”
1KI.13.23	After he had eaten bread, and after he drank, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
1KI.13.24	When he had gone, a lion met him by the way and killed him. His body was thrown on the path, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the body. 
1KI.13.25	Behold, men passed by, and saw the body thrown on the path, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived. 
1KI.13.26	When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who was disobedient to the 
1KI.13.27	He said to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me,” and they saddled it. 
1KI.13.28	He went and found his body thrown on the path, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body, nor mauled the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn, and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”
1KI.13.31	After he had buried him, he spoke to his sons, saying, “When I am dead, bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones. 
1KI.13.32	For the saying which he cried by the 
1KI.13.33	After this thing Jeroboam didn’t return from his evil way, but again made priests of the high places from amongst all the people. Whoever wanted to, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places. 
1KI.13.34	This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick. 
1KI.14.2	Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please get up and disguise yourself, so that you won’t be recognised as Jeroboam’s wife. Go to Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who said that I would be king over this people. 
1KI.14.3	Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the child.”
1KI.14.4	Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to Ahijah’s house. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. 
1KI.14.5	The 
1KI.14.6	So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, Jeroboam’s wife! Why do you pretend to be another? For I am sent to you with heavy news. 
1KI.14.7	Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘The 
1KI.14.8	and tore the kingdom away from David’s house, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes, 
1KI.14.9	but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods, molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back; 
1KI.14.10	therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall,
1KI.14.11	The dogs will eat he who belongs to Jeroboam who dies in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field: for the 
1KI.14.12	Arise therefore, and go to your house. When your feet enter into the city, the child will die. 
1KI.14.13	All Israel will mourn for him and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam will come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing towards the 
1KI.14.14	Moreover the 
1KI.14.15	For the 
1KI.14.16	He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.”
1KI.14.17	Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. 
1KI.14.18	All Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the 
1KI.14.19	The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
1KI.14.20	The days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty two years, then he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.
1KI.14.21	Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
1KI.14.22	Judah did that which was evil in the 
1KI.14.23	For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree. 
1KI.14.24	There were also sodomites in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the 
1KI.14.25	In the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, 
1KI.14.26	and he took away the treasures of the 
1KI.14.27	King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. 
1KI.14.28	It was so, that as often as the king went into the 
1KI.14.29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
1KI.14.30	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
1KI.14.31	Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam his son reigned in his place.
1KI.15.1	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah. 
1KI.15.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.3	He walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with the 
1KI.15.4	Nevertheless for David’s sake, the 
1KI.15.5	because David did that which was right in the 
1KI.15.6	Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. 
1KI.15.7	The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
1KI.15.8	Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Asa his son reigned in his place.
1KI.15.9	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah. 
1KI.15.10	He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.11	Asa did that which was right in the 
1KI.15.12	He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 
1KI.15.13	He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah. Asa cut down her image and burnt it at the brook Kidron. 
1KI.15.14	But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with the 
1KI.15.15	He brought into the 
1KI.15.16	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 
1KI.15.17	Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
1KI.15.18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that was left in the treasures of the 
1KI.15.19	“There is a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.”
1KI.15.20	Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah. 
1KI.15.22	Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah. No one was exempted. They carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa used it to build Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. 
1KI.15.23	Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
1KI.15.24	Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in his father David’s city; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.
1KI.15.25	Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years. 
1KI.15.26	He did that which was evil in the 
1KI.15.27	Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon. 
1KI.15.28	Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha killed him, and reigned in his place. 
1KI.15.29	As soon as he was king, he struck all the house of Jeroboam. He didn’t leave to Jeroboam any who breathed, until he had destroyed him; according to the saying of the 
1KI.15.30	for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked the 
1KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.15.32	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah for twenty-four years. 
1KI.15.34	He did that which was evil in the 
1KI.16.1	The 
1KI.16.2	“Because I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; 
1KI.16.3	behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	The dogs will eat Baasha’s descendants who die in the city; and he who dies of his in the field, the birds of the sky will eat.”
1KI.16.5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.6	Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his place.
1KI.16.7	Moreover the 
1KI.16.8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah for two years. 
1KI.16.9	His servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah; 
1KI.16.10	and Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.
1KI.16.11	When he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, he attacked all the house of Baasha. He didn’t leave him a single one who urinates on a wall
1KI.16.12	Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the 
1KI.16.13	for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin, to provoke the 
1KI.16.14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 
1KI.16.16	The people who were encamped heard that Zimri had conspired, and had also killed the king. Therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
1KI.16.17	Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the fortified part of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died, 
1KI.16.19	for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the 
1KI.16.20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he committed, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.21	Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. 
1KI.16.22	But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. 
1KI.16.23	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel for twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirzah. 
1KI.16.24	He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents
1KI.16.25	Omri did that which was evil in the 
1KI.16.26	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the 
1KI.16.27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.16.28	So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place.
1KI.16.29	In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel. Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. 
1KI.16.30	Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the 
1KI.16.31	As if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him. 
1KI.16.32	He raised up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. 
1KI.16.33	Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did more yet to provoke the 
1KI.16.34	In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho. He laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the 
1KI.17.1	Elijah the Tishbite, who was one of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the 
1KI.17.2	Then the 
1KI.17.3	“Go away from here, turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. 
1KI.17.4	You shall drink from the brook. I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.” 
1KI.17.5	So he went and did according to the 
1KI.17.6	The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook. 
1KI.17.7	After a while, the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
1KI.17.8	The 
1KI.17.9	“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain you.”
1KI.17.10	So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her, and said, “Please get me a little water in a jar, that I may drink.”
1KI.17.11	As she was going to get it, he called to her, and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.”
1KI.17.12	She said, “As the 
1KI.17.13	Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do as you have said; but make me a little cake from it first, and bring it out to me, and afterward make some for you and for your son. 
1KI.17.14	For the 
1KI.17.15	She went and did according to the saying of Elijah; and she, and he, and her house, ate many days. 
1KI.17.16	The jar of meal didn’t run out, and the jar of oil didn’t fail, according to the 
1KI.17.17	After these things, the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. 
1KI.17.18	She said to Elijah, “What have I to do with you, you man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to memory, and to kill my son!”
1KI.17.19	He said to her, “Give me your son.” He took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the room where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed. 
1KI.17.20	He cried to the 
1KI.17.21	He stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to the 
1KI.17.22	The 
1KI.17.23	Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the room into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Elijah said, “Behold, your son lives.”
1KI.17.24	The woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the 
1KI.18.1	After many days, the 
1KI.18.2	Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria. 
1KI.18.3	Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the 
1KI.18.4	for when Jezebel cut off the 
1KI.18.5	Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the animals.”
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. 
1KI.18.7	As Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. He recognised him, and fell on his face, and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”
1KI.18.8	He answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here!’”
1KI.18.9	He said, “How have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? 
1KI.18.10	As the 
1KI.18.11	Now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’ 
1KI.18.12	It will happen, as soon as I leave you, that the 
1KI.18.13	Wasn’t it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the 
1KI.18.14	Now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here”.’ He will kill me.”
1KI.18.15	Elijah said, “As the 
1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
1KI.18.17	When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”
1KI.18.18	He answered, “I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father’s house, in that you have forsaken the 
1KI.18.19	Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and four hundred and fifty of the prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”
1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	Elijah came near to all the people, and said, “How long will you waver between the two sides? If the 
1KI.18.21	The people didn’t say a word.
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left as a prophet of the 
1KI.18.23	Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it. 
1KI.18.24	You call on the name of your god, and I will call on the 
1KI.18.24	All the people answered, “What you say is good.”
1KI.18.25	Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.”
1KI.18.26	They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, “Baal, hear us!” But there was no voice, and nobody answered. They leapt about the altar which was made. 
1KI.18.27	At noon, Elijah mocked them, and said, “Cry aloud; for he is a god. Either he is deep in thought, or he has gone somewhere, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened.”
1KI.18.28	They cried aloud, and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them. 
1KI.18.29	When midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the evening offering; but there was no voice, no answer, and nobody paid attention.
1KI.18.30	Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me!”; and all the people came near to him. He repaired the 
1KI.18.31	Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the 
1KI.18.32	With the stones he built an altar in the 
1KI.18.33	He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, “Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.” 
1KI.18.34	He said, “Do it a second time;” and they did it the second time. He said, “Do it a third time;” and they did it the third time. 
1KI.18.35	The water ran around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.
1KI.18.36	At the time of the evening offering, Elijah the prophet came near, and said, “
1KI.18.37	Hear me, 
1KI.18.38	Then the 
1KI.18.39	When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. They said, “The 
1KI.18.40	Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Don’t let one of them escape!”
1KI.18.40	They seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there. 
1KI.18.41	Elijah said to Ahab, “Get up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.”
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees. 
1KI.18.43	He said to his servant, “Go up now, and look towards the sea.”
1KI.18.43	He went up, and looked, and said, “There is nothing.”
1KI.18.43	He said, “Go again” seven times.
1KI.18.44	On the seventh time, he said, “Behold, a small cloud, like a man’s hand, is rising out of the sea.”
1KI.18.44	He said, “Go up, tell Ahab, ‘Get ready and go down, so that the rain doesn’t stop you.’”
1KI.18.45	In a little while, the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. 
1KI.18.46	The 
1KI.19.1	Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 
1KI.19.2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I don’t make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time!”
1KI.19.3	When he saw that, he arose, and ran for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there. 
1KI.19.4	But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree. Then he requested for himself that he might die, and said, “It is enough. Now, O 
1KI.19.5	He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise and eat!”
1KI.19.6	He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again. 
1KI.19.7	The 
1KI.19.8	He arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, God’s Mountain. 
1KI.19.9	He came to a cave there, and camped there; and behold, the 
1KI.19.10	He said, “I have been very jealous for the 
1KI.19.11	He said, “Go out, and stand on the mountain before the 
1KI.19.11	Behold, the 
1KI.19.12	After the earthquake a fire passed; but the 
1KI.19.13	When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle, went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. Behold, a voice came to him, and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
1KI.19.14	He said, “I have been very jealous for the 
1KI.19.15	The 
1KI.19.16	Anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel; and anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your place. 
1KI.19.17	He who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill. 
1KI.19.18	Yet I reserved seven thousand in Israel, all the knees of which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.”
1KI.19.19	So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth. Elijah went over to him, and put his mantle on him. 
1KI.19.20	Elisha left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me please kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.”
1KI.19.20	He said to him, “Go back again; for what have I done to you?”
1KI.19.21	He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their meat with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and served him.
1KI.20.1	Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together; and there were thirty-two kings with him, with horses and chariots. He went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it. 
1KI.20.2	He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him, “Ben Hadad says, 
1KI.20.3	‘Your silver and your gold is mine. Your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.’”
1KI.20.4	The king of Israel answered, “It is according to your saying, my lord, O king. I am yours, and all that I have.”
1KI.20.5	The messengers came again, and said, “Ben Hadad says, ‘I sent indeed to you, saying, “You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children; 
1KI.20.6	but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they will search your house, and the houses of your servants; whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they will put it in their hand, and take it away.”’”
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, “Please notice how this man seeks mischief; for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn’t deny him.”
1KI.20.8	All the elders and all the people said to him, “Don’t listen, and don’t consent.”
1KI.20.9	Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you sent for to your servant at the first I will do; but this thing I cannot do.’”
1KI.20.9	The messengers departed, and brought him back the message. 
1KI.20.10	Ben Hadad sent to him, and said, “The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria will be enough for handfuls for all the people who follow me.”
1KI.20.11	The king of Israel answered, “Tell him, ‘Don’t let him who puts on his armour brag like he who takes it off.’”
1KI.20.12	When Ben Hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, he said to his servants, “Prepare to attack!” So they prepared to attack the city.
1KI.20.13	Behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, “The 
1KI.20.14	Ahab said, “By whom?”
1KI.20.14	He said, “The 
1KI.20.14	Then he said, “Who shall begin the battle?”
1KI.20.14	He answered, “You.”
1KI.20.15	Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two. After them, he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand. 
1KI.20.16	They went out at noon. But Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him. 
1KI.20.17	The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, “Men are coming out from Samaria.”
1KI.20.18	He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.”
1KI.20.19	So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them. 
1KI.20.20	They each killed his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen. 
1KI.20.21	The king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter. 
1KI.20.22	The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.”
1KI.20.23	The servants of the king of Syria said to him, “Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we. But let’s fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they. 
1KI.20.24	Do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their place. 
1KI.20.25	Muster an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. We will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they are.”
1KI.20.25	He listened to their voice, and did so. 
1KI.20.26	At the return of the year, Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. 
1KI.20.27	The children of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and went against them. The children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of young goats; but the Syrians filled the country. 
1KI.20.28	A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, “The 
1KI.20.29	They encamped opposite each other for seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the Syrians in one day. 
1KI.20.30	But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner room. 
1KI.20.31	His servants said to him, “See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let us put sackcloth on our bodies, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he will save your life.”
1KI.20.32	So they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, “Your servant Ben Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’”
1KI.20.32	He said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”
1KI.20.33	Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to take this phrase; and they said, “Your brother Ben Hadad.”
1KI.20.33	Then he said, “Go, bring him.”
1KI.20.33	Then Ben Hadad came out to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. 
1KI.20.34	Ben Hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore. You shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.”
1KI.20.34	“I”, said Ahab, “will let you go with this covenant.” So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.
1KI.20.35	A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the 
1KI.20.35	The man refused to strike him. 
1KI.20.36	Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the 
1KI.20.37	Then he found another man, and said, “Please strike me.”
1KI.20.37	The man struck him and wounded him. 
1KI.20.38	So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes. 
1KI.20.39	As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said, “Your servant went out into the middle of the battle; and behold, a man came over, and brought a man to me, and said, ‘Guard this man! If by any means he is missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent
1KI.20.40	As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.”
1KI.20.40	The king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgement be. You yourself have decided it.”
1KI.20.41	He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognised that he was one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	He said to him, “The 
1KI.20.43	The king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.
1KI.21.1	After these things, Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
1KI.21.2	Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near my house; and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.”
1KI.21.3	Naboth said to Ahab, “May the 
1KI.21.4	Ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” He laid himself down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. 
1KI.21.5	But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, “Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?”
1KI.21.6	He said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ He answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”
1KI.21.7	Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.” 
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, who lived with Naboth. 
1KI.21.9	She wrote in the letters, saying, “Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high amongst the people. 
1KI.21.10	Set two men, wicked fellows, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, ‘You cursed God and the king!’ Then carry him out, and stone him to death.”
1KI.21.11	The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had instructed them in the letters which she had written and sent to them. 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high amongst the people. 
1KI.21.13	The two men, the wicked fellows, came in and sat before him. The wicked fellows testified against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king!” Then they carried him out of the city and stoned him to death with stones. 
1KI.21.14	Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned, and is dead.”
1KI.21.15	When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned, and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.”
1KI.21.16	When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
1KI.21.17	The 
1KI.21.18	“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it. 
1KI.21.19	You shall speak to him, saying, ‘The 
1KI.21.20	Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, my enemy?”
1KI.21.20	He answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the 
1KI.21.21	Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall,
1KI.21.22	I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.” 
1KI.21.23	The 
1KI.21.24	The dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field.”
1KI.21.25	But there was no one like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the 
1KI.21.26	He did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the 
1KI.21.27	When Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
1KI.21.28	The 
1KI.21.29	“See how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but I will bring the evil on his house in his son’s day.”
1KI.22.1	They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. 
1KI.22.2	In the third year, Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.3	The king of Israel said to his servants, “You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we do nothing, and don’t take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?” 
1KI.22.4	He said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead?”
1KI.22.4	Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” 
1KI.22.5	Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please enquire first for the 
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Should I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or should I refrain?”
1KI.22.6	They said, “Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of the 
1KI.22.8	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may enquire of the 
1KI.22.8	Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.”
1KI.22.9	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, “Quickly get Micaiah the son of Imlah.”
1KI.22.10	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 
1KI.22.11	Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron, and said, “The 
1KI.22.12	All the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for the 
1KI.22.13	The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “See now, the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak good.”
1KI.22.14	Micaiah said, “As the 
1KI.22.15	When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?”
1KI.22.15	He answered him, “Go up and prosper; and the 
1KI.22.16	The king said to him, “How many times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the 
1KI.22.17	He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. The 
1KI.22.18	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”
1KI.22.19	Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the 
1KI.22.20	The 
1KI.22.21	A spirit came out and stood before the 
1KI.22.22	The 
1KI.22.22	He said, ‘I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’
1KI.22.22	He said, ‘You will entice him, and will also prevail. Go out and do so.’ 
1KI.22.23	Now therefore, behold, the 
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the 
1KI.22.25	Micaiah said, “Behold, you will see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.”
1KI.22.26	The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son. 
1KI.22.27	Say, ‘The king says, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.”’”
1KI.22.28	Micaiah said, “If you return at all in peace, the 
1KI.22.29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. 
1KI.22.30	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes.” The king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
1KI.22.31	Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, “Don’t fight with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.”
1KI.22.32	When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely that is the king of Israel!” and they came over to fight against him. Jehoshaphat cried out. 
1KI.22.33	When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
1KI.22.34	A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armour. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn your hand, and carry me out of the battle; for I am severely wounded.” 
1KI.22.35	The battle increased that day. The king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot. 
1KI.22.36	A cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, “Every man to his city, and every man to his country!”
1KI.22.37	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. 
1KI.22.38	They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves; according to the 
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.
1KI.22.41	Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	He walked in all the way of Asa his father. He didn’t turn away from it, doing that which was right in the 
1KI.22.44	Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he fought, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
1KI.22.46	The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land. 
1KI.22.47	There was no king in Edom. A deputy ruled. 
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they didn’t go; for the ships wrecked at Ezion Geber. 
1KI.22.49	Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat would not. 
1KI.22.50	Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in his father David’s city. Jehoram his son reigned in his place.
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. 
1KI.22.52	He did that which was evil in the 
1KI.22.53	He served Baal and worshipped him, and provoked the 
2KI.1.1	Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 
2KI.1.2	Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, “Go, enquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.”
2KI.1.3	But the 
2KI.1.4	Now therefore the 
2KI.1.5	The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?”
2KI.1.6	They said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, “The 
2KI.1.7	He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?”
2KI.1.8	They answered him, “He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.”
2KI.1.8	He said, “It’s Elijah the Tishbite.”
2KI.1.9	Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold,
2KI.1.10	Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.11	Again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He answered him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’”
2KI.1.12	Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Then God’s fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.13	Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty of your servants, be precious in your sight. 
2KI.1.14	Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.”
2KI.1.15	The 
2KI.1.15	Then he arose, and went down with him to the king. 
2KI.1.16	He said to him, “The 
2KI.1.17	So he died according to the 
2KI.1.18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.2.1	When the 
2KI.2.2	Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for the 
2KI.2.2	Elisha said, “As the 
2KI.2.3	The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that the 
2KI.2.3	He said, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”
2KI.2.4	Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please wait here, for the 
2KI.2.4	He said, “As the 
2KI.2.5	The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that the 
2KI.2.5	He answered, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”
2KI.2.6	Elijah said to him, “Please wait here, for the 
2KI.2.6	He said, “As the 
2KI.2.7	Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan. 
2KI.2.8	Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground. 
2KI.2.9	When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.”
2KI.2.9	Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.”
2KI.2.10	He said, “You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so for you; but if not, it will not be so.”
2KI.2.11	As they continued on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. 
2KI.2.12	Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”
2KI.2.12	He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces. 
2KI.2.13	He also took up Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	He took Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is the 
2KI.2.15	When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho facing him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. 
2KI.2.16	They said to him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps the 
2KI.2.16	He said, “Don’t send them.”
2KI.2.17	When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.”
2KI.2.17	Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him. 
2KI.2.18	They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go?’”
2KI.2.19	The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.”
2KI.2.20	He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” Then they brought it to him. 
2KI.2.21	He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “The 
2KI.2.22	So the waters were healed to this day, according to Elisha’s word which he spoke.
2KI.2.23	He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!” 
2KI.2.24	He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the 
2KI.2.25	He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. 
2KI.3.2	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from them. 
2KI.3.4	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he supplied the king of Israel with the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams. 
2KI.3.5	But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel. 
2KI.3.7	He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?”
2KI.3.7	He said, “I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” 
2KI.3.8	He said, “Which way shall we go up?”
2KI.3.8	He answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.” 
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched for seven days along a circuitous route. There was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them. 
2KI.3.10	The king of Israel said, “Alas! For the 
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of the 
2KI.3.11	One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah, is here.”
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat said, “The 
2KI.3.13	Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.”
2KI.3.13	The king of Israel said to him, “No, for the 
2KI.3.14	Elisha said, “As the 
2KI.3.15	But now bring me a musician.” When the musician played, the 
2KI.3.16	He said, “The 
2KI.3.17	For the 
2KI.3.18	This is an easy thing in the 
2KI.3.19	You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’”
2KI.3.20	In the morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
2KI.3.21	Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armour, young and old, and stood on the border. 
2KI.3.22	They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood. 
2KI.3.23	They said, “This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the plunder!”
2KI.3.24	When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land attacking the Moabites. 
2KI.3.25	They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land each man cast his stone, and filled it. They also stopped all the springs of water, and cut down all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth all they left was its stones; however the men armed with slings went around it, and attacked it. 
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew a sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not. 
2KI.3.27	Then he took his oldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
2KI.4.1	Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared the 
2KI.4.2	Elisha said to her, “What should I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?”
2KI.4.2	She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.”
2KI.4.3	Then he said, “Go, borrow empty containers from all your neighbours. Don’t borrow just a few containers. 
2KI.4.4	Go in and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour oil into all those containers; and set aside those which are full.”
2KI.4.5	So she went from him, and shut the door on herself and on her sons. They brought the containers to her, and she poured oil. 
2KI.4.6	When the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.”
2KI.4.6	He said to her, “There isn’t another container.” Then the oil stopped flowing.
2KI.4.7	Then she came and told the man of God. He said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.”
2KI.4.8	One day Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread. 
2KI.4.9	She said to her husband, “See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passes by us continually. 
2KI.4.10	Please let’s make a little room on the roof. Let’s set a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand for him there. When he comes to us, he can stay there.”
2KI.4.11	One day he came there, and he went to the room and lay there. 
2KI.4.12	He said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him. 
2KI.4.13	He said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?’”
2KI.4.13	She answered, “I dwell amongst my own people.”
2KI.4.14	He said, “What then is to be done for her?”
2KI.4.14	Gehazi answered, “Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old.”
2KI.4.15	He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the door. 
2KI.4.16	He said, “At this season, when the time comes around, you will embrace a son.”
2KI.4.16	She said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your servant.”
2KI.4.17	The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her. 
2KI.4.18	When the child was grown, one day he went out to his father to the reapers. 
2KI.4.19	He said to his father, “My head! My head!”
2KI.4.19	He said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”
2KI.4.20	When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died. 
2KI.4.21	She went up and laid him on the man of God’s bed, and shut the door on him, and went out. 
2KI.4.22	She called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.”
2KI.4.23	He said, “Why would you want go to him today? It is not a new moon or a Sabbath.”
2KI.4.23	She said, “It’s all right.”
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward! Don’t slow down for me, unless I ask you to.”
2KI.4.25	So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her afar off, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Behold, there is the Shunammite. 
2KI.4.26	Please run now to meet her, and ask her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with your child?’”
2KI.4.26	She answered, “It is well.”
2KI.4.27	When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, “Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled within her; and the 
2KI.4.28	Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don’t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don’t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the child’s face.”
2KI.4.30	The child’s mother said, “As the 
2KI.4.30	So he arose, and followed her.
2KI.4.31	Gehazi went ahead of them, and laid the staff on the child’s face; but there was no voice and no hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, “The child has not awakened.”
2KI.4.32	When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lying on his bed. 
2KI.4.33	He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to the 
2KI.4.34	He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the child’s flesh grew warm. 
2KI.4.35	Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself out on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. 
2KI.4.36	He called Gehazi, and said, “Call this Shunammite!” So he called her.
2KI.4.36	When she had come in to him, he said, “Take up your son.”
2KI.4.37	Then she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; then she picked up her son, and went out.
2KI.4.38	Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Get the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”
2KI.4.39	One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds from it, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew; for they didn’t recognise them. 
2KI.4.40	So they poured out for the men to eat. As they were eating some of the stew, they cried out, and said, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it.
2KI.4.41	But he said, “Then bring meal.” He threw it into the pot; and he said, “Serve it to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
2KI.4.42	A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God some bread of the first fruits: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, “Give to the people, that they may eat.”
2KI.4.43	His servant said, “What, should I set this before a hundred men?”
2KI.4.43	But he said, “Give the people, that they may eat; for the 
2KI.4.44	So he set it before them, and they ate, and had some left over, according to the 
2KI.5.1	Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the 
2KI.5.2	The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman’s wife. 
2KI.5.3	She said to her mistress, “I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.”
2KI.5.4	Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, “The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this.”
2KI.5.5	The king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”
2KI.5.5	He departed, and took with him ten talents
2KI.5.6	He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, “Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.”
2KI.5.7	When the king of Israel had read the letter, he tore his clothes, and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.”
2KI.5.8	It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”
2KI.5.9	So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. 
2KI.5.10	Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.”
2KI.5.11	But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the 
2KI.5.12	Aren’t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them, and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.
2KI.5.13	His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn’t you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean?’”
2KI.5.14	Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. 
2KI.5.15	He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, “See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.”
2KI.5.16	But he said, “As the 
2KI.5.16	He urged him to take it; but he refused. 
2KI.5.17	Naaman said, “If not, then, please let two mules’ burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the 
2KI.5.18	In this thing may the 
2KI.5.19	He said to him, “Go in peace.”
2KI.5.19	So he departed from him a little way. 
2KI.5.20	But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As the 
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?”
2KI.5.22	He said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent
2KI.5.23	Naaman said, “Be pleased to take two talents.” He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him. 
2KI.5.24	When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed. 
2KI.5.25	But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where did you come from, Gehazi?”
2KI.5.25	He said, “Your servant went nowhere.”
2KI.5.26	He said to him, “Didn’t my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants? 
2KI.5.27	Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your offspring
2KI.5.27	He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.
2KI.6.1	The sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See now, the place where we live and meet with you is too small for us. 
2KI.6.2	Please let us go to the Jordan, and each man take a beam from there, and let’s make us a place there, where we may live.”
2KI.6.2	He answered, “Go!”
2KI.6.3	One said, “Please be pleased to go with your servants.”
2KI.6.3	He answered, “I will go.” 
2KI.6.4	So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood. 
2KI.6.5	But as one was cutting down a tree, the axe head fell into the water. Then he cried, and said, “Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.”
2KI.6.6	The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” He showed him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float. 
2KI.6.7	He said, “Take it.” So he put out his hand and took it.
2KI.6.8	Now the king of Syria was at war against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, “My camp will be in such and such a place.”
2KI.6.9	The man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you not pass this place; for the Syrians are coming down there.” 
2KI.6.10	The king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once or twice. 
2KI.6.11	The king of Syria’s heart was very troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them, “Won’t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?”
2KI.6.12	One of his servants said, “No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”
2KI.6.13	He said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.”
2KI.6.13	He was told, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”
2KI.6.14	Therefore he sent horses, chariots, and a great army there. They came by night, and surrounded the city. 
2KI.6.15	When the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”
2KI.6.16	He answered, “Don’t be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” 
2KI.6.17	Elisha prayed, and said, “
2KI.6.18	When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the 
2KI.6.18	He struck them with blindness according to Elisha’s word. 
2KI.6.19	Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” He led them to Samaria. 
2KI.6.20	When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, “
2KI.6.20	The 
2KI.6.21	The king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, “My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?”
2KI.6.22	He answered, “You shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.”
2KI.6.23	He prepared a great feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria stopped raiding the land of Israel.
2KI.6.24	After this, Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	There was a great famine in Samaria. Behold, they besieged it, until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab
2KI.6.26	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”
2KI.6.27	He said, “If the 
2KI.6.28	The king said to her, “What is your problem?”
2KI.6.28	She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him;’ and she has hidden her son.”
2KI.6.30	When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. Now he was passing by on the wall, and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his body. 
2KI.6.31	Then he said, “God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat stays on him today.”
2KI.6.32	But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a man from before him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door shut against him. Isn’t the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”
2KI.6.33	While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. Then he said, “Behold, this evil is from the 
2KI.7.1	Elisha said, “Hear the 
2KI.7.2	Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, “Behold, if the 
2KI.7.2	He said, “Behold, you will see it with your eyes, but will not eat of it.”
2KI.7.3	Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said to one another, “Why do we sit here until we die? 
2KI.7.4	If we say, ‘We will enter into the city,’ then the famine is in the city, and we will die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let’s surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die.”
2KI.7.5	They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, no man was there. 
2KI.7.6	For the Lord
2KI.7.7	Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. 
2KI.7.8	When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried things from there also, and went and hid them. 
2KI.7.9	Then they said to one another, “We aren’t doing right. Today is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let’s go and tell the king’s household.”
2KI.7.10	So they came and called to the city gatekeepers; and they told them, “We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, not even a man’s voice, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.”
2KI.7.11	He called the gatekeepers; and they told it to the king’s household within. 
2KI.7.12	The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, “I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.’”
2KI.7.13	One of his servants answered, “Please let some people take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let’s send and see.”
2KI.7.14	Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them out to the Syrian army, saying, “Go and see.”
2KI.7.15	They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the path was full of garments and equipment which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king. 
2KI.7.16	The people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a seah
2KI.7.17	The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate; and the people trampled over him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him. 
2KI.7.18	It happened as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two seahs
2KI.7.19	and that captain answered the man of God, and said, “Now, behold, if the 
2KI.7.20	It happened like that to him; for the people trampled over him in the gate, and he died.
2KI.8.1	Now Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise, and go, you and your household, and stay for a while wherever you can; for the 
2KI.8.2	The woman arose, and did according to the man of God’s word. She went with her household, and lived in the land of the Philistines for seven years. 
2KI.8.3	At the end of seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. Then she went out to beg the king for her house and for her land. 
2KI.8.4	Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.” 
2KI.8.5	As he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, begged the king for her house and for her land. Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.”
2KI.8.6	When the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, “Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.”
2KI.8.7	Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick. He was told, “The man of God has come here.”
2KI.8.8	The king said to Hazael, “Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the 
2KI.8.9	So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, “Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Will I recover from this sickness?’”
2KI.8.10	Elisha said to him, “Go, tell him, ‘You will surely recover;’ however the 
2KI.8.11	He settled his gaze steadfastly on him, until he was ashamed. Then the man of God wept.
2KI.8.12	Hazael said, “Why do you weep, my lord?”
2KI.8.12	He answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and will dash their little ones in pieces, and rip up their pregnant women.”
2KI.8.13	Hazael said, “But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he could do this great thing?”
2KI.8.13	Elisha answered, “The 
2KI.8.14	Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?”
2KI.8.14	He answered, “He told me that you would surely recover.”
2KI.8.15	On the next day, he took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died. Then Hazael reigned in his place.
2KI.8.16	In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.8.17	He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign. He reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2KI.8.18	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did Ahab’s house; for he married Ahab’s daughter. He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.8.19	However the 
2KI.8.20	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. 
2KI.8.21	Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents. 
2KI.8.22	So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. 
2KI.8.23	The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.8.24	Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place. 
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	He walked in the way of Ahab’s house, and did that which was evil in the 
2KI.8.28	He went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram. 
2KI.8.29	King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel from the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2KI.9.1	Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, “Put your belt on your waist, take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead. 
2KI.9.2	When you come there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him rise up from amongst his brothers, and take him to an inner room. 
2KI.9.3	Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, ‘The 
2KI.9.4	So the young man, even the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead. 
2KI.9.5	When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting. Then he said, “I have a message for you, captain.”
2KI.9.5	Jehu said, “To which of us all?”
2KI.9.5	He said, “To you, O captain.” 
2KI.9.6	He arose, and went into the house. Then he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, “The 
2KI.9.7	You must strike your master Ahab’s house, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the 
2KI.9.8	For the whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall,
2KI.9.9	I will make Ahab’s house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	The dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel, and there shall be no one to bury her.’” Then he opened the door and fled.
2KI.9.11	When Jehu came out to the servants of his lord, and one said to him, “Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?”
2KI.9.11	He said to them, “You know the man and how he talks.” 
2KI.9.12	They said, “That is a lie. Tell us now.”
2KI.9.12	He said, “He said to me, ‘The 
2KI.9.13	Then they hurried, and each man took his cloak, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king.”
2KI.9.14	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria; 
2KI.9.15	but king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, “If this is your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.” 
2KI.9.16	So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram. 
2KI.9.17	Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.”
2KI.9.17	Joram said, “Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”
2KI.9.18	So one went on horseback to meet him, and said, “the king says, ‘Is it peace?’”
2KI.9.18	Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”
2KI.9.18	The watchman said, “The messenger came to them, but he isn’t coming back.”
2KI.9.19	Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, “The king says, ‘Is it peace?’”
2KI.9.19	Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”
2KI.9.20	The watchman said, “He came to them, and isn’t coming back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”
2KI.9.21	Joram said, “Get ready!”
2KI.9.21	They got his chariot ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him on Naboth the Jezreelite’s land. 
2KI.9.22	When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?”
2KI.9.22	He answered, “What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?”
2KI.9.23	Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “This is treason, Ahaziah!”
2KI.9.24	Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. 
2KI.9.25	Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, “Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab his father, the 
2KI.9.26	‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,’ says the 
2KI.9.27	But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, “Strike him also in the chariot!” They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there. 
2KI.9.28	His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in David’s city. 
2KI.9.29	In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.
2KI.9.30	When Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out at the window. 
2KI.9.31	As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, “Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?”
2KI.9.32	He lifted up his face to the window, and said, “Who is on my side? Who?”
2KI.9.32	Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
2KI.9.33	He said, “Throw her down!”
2KI.9.33	So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot. 
2KI.9.34	When he had come in, he ate and drank. Then he said, “See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.”
2KI.9.35	They went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands. 
2KI.9.36	Therefore they came back, and told him.
2KI.9.36	He said, “This is the 
2KI.9.37	and the body of Jezebel will be as dung on the face of the field on Jezreel’s land, so that they won’t say, “This is Jezebel.”’”
2KI.10.1	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up Ahab’s sons, saying, 
2KI.10.2	“Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armour, 
2KI.10.3	Select the best and fittest of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”
2KI.10.4	But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Behold, the two kings didn’t stand before him! How then shall we stand?” 
2KI.10.5	He who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who raised the children, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and will do all that you ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good in your eyes.”
2KI.10.6	Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men who are your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time.”
2KI.10.6	Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up. 
2KI.10.7	When the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and killed them, even seventy people, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	A messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”
2KI.10.8	He said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.” 
2KI.10.9	In the morning, he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, “You are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these? 
2KI.10.10	Know now that nothing will fall to the earth of the 
2KI.10.11	So Jehu struck all that remained of Ahab’s house in Jezreel, with all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him no one remaining.
2KI.10.12	He arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way, 
2KI.10.13	Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who are you?”
2KI.10.13	They answered, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen.”
2KI.10.14	He said, “Take them alive!”
2KI.10.14	They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even forty-two men. He didn’t leave any of them.
2KI.10.15	When he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?”
2KI.10.15	Jehonadab answered, “It is.”
2KI.10.15	“If it is, give me your hand.” He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. 
2KI.10.16	He said, “Come with me, and see my zeal for the 
2KI.10.17	When he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the 
2KI.10.18	Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much. 
2KI.10.19	Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all of his worshippers, and all of his priests. Let no one be absent; for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent, he shall not live.” But Jehu did deceptively, intending to destroy the worshippers of Baal.
2KI.10.20	Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!”
2KI.10.20	So they proclaimed it. 
2KI.10.21	Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn’t come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another. 
2KI.10.22	He said to him who kept the wardrobe, “Bring out robes for all the worshippers of Baal!”
2KI.10.22	So he brought robes out to them. 
2KI.10.23	Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal. Then he said to the worshippers of Baal, “Search, and see that none of the servants of the 
2KI.10.24	So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men outside, and said, “If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.”
2KI.10.25	As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in and kill them! Let no one escape.” So they struck them with the edge of the sword. The guard and the captains threw the bodies out, and went to the inner shrine of the house of Baal. 
2KI.10.26	They brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burnt them. 
2KI.10.27	They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day. 
2KI.10.28	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2KI.10.29	However, Jehu didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, the golden calves that were in Bethel and that were in Dan. 
2KI.10.30	The 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the 
2KI.10.32	In those days the 
2KI.10.33	from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. 
2KI.10.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.10.35	Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place. 
2KI.10.36	The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2KI.11.1	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring. 
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from amongst the king’s sons who were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedroom; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain. 
2KI.11.3	He was with her hidden in the 
2KI.11.4	In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the 
2KI.11.5	He commanded them, saying, “This is what you must do: a third of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king’s house; 
2KI.11.6	a third of you shall be at the gate Sur; and a third of you at the gate behind the guard. So you shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier. 
2KI.11.7	The two companies of you, even all who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of the 
2KI.11.8	You shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks, let him be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.”
2KI.11.9	The captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 
2KI.11.10	The priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David’s, which were in the 
2KI.11.11	The guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king. 
2KI.11.12	Then he brought out the king’s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!”
2KI.11.13	When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the 
2KI.11.14	and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the tradition was, with the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, “Treason! Treason!”
2KI.11.15	Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks. Kill anyone who follows her with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t let her be slain in the 
2KI.11.16	So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses’ entry to the king’s house, and she was slain there. 
2KI.11.17	Jehoiada made a covenant between the 
2KI.11.18	All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down. They broke his altars and his images in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. The priest appointed officers over the 
2KI.11.19	He took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the 
2KI.11.20	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. They had slain Athaliah with the sword at the king’s house.
2KI.11.21	Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
2KI.12.1	Jehoash began to reign in the seventh year of Jehu, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba. 
2KI.12.2	Jehoash did that which was right in the 
2KI.12.3	However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. 
2KI.12.4	Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the holy things that is brought into the 
2KI.12.5	let the priests take it to them, each man from his donor; and they shall repair the damage to the house, wherever any damage is found.”
2KI.12.6	But it was so, that in the twenty-third year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the damage to the house. 
2KI.12.7	Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, “Why don’t you repair the damage to the house? Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for repair of the damage to the house.”
2KI.12.8	The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, and not repair the damage to the house. 
2KI.12.9	But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the 
2KI.12.10	When they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put it in bags and counted the money that was found in the 
2KI.12.11	They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the 
2KI.12.12	and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the damage to the 
2KI.12.13	But there were not made for the 
2KI.12.14	for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired the 
2KI.12.15	Moreover they didn’t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully. 
2KI.12.16	The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings was not brought into the 
2KI.12.17	Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 
2KI.12.18	Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own holy things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the 
2KI.12.19	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.12.20	His servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla. 
2KI.12.21	For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in David’s city; and Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
2KI.13.1	In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years. 
2KI.13.2	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.13.3	The 
2KI.13.4	Jehoahaz begged the 
2KI.13.5	(The 
2KI.13.6	Nevertheless they didn’t depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained in Samaria.) 
2KI.13.7	For he didn’t leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing. 
2KI.13.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.9	Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son reigned in his place.
2KI.13.10	In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria for sixteen years. 
2KI.13.11	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.13.12	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.13.13	Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne. Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2KI.13.14	Now Elisha became sick with the illness of which he died; and Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over him, and said, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”
2KI.13.15	Elisha said to him, “Take bow and arrows;” and he took bow and arrows for himself. 
2KI.13.16	He said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow;” and he put his hand on it. Elisha laid his hands on the king’s hands. 
2KI.13.17	He said, “Open the window eastward;” and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot!” and he shot. He said, “The 
2KI.13.18	He said, “Take the arrows;” and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground;” and he struck three times, and stopped. 
2KI.13.19	The man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it; whereas now you will strike Syria just three times.”
2KI.13.20	Elisha died, and they buried him.
2KI.13.20	Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. 
2KI.13.21	As they were burying a man, behold, they saw a band of raiders; and they threw the man into Elisha’s tomb. As soon as the man touched Elisha’s bones, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
2KI.13.22	Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 
2KI.13.23	But the 
2KI.13.24	Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his place. 
2KI.13.25	Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Joash struck him three times, and recovered the cities of Israel.
2KI.14.1	In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.14.2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem. 
2KI.14.3	He did that which was right in the 
2KI.14.4	However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. 
2KI.14.5	As soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, he killed his servants who had slain the king his father, 
2KI.14.6	but the children of the murderers he didn’t put to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as the 
2KI.14.7	He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel, to this day. 
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let’s look one another in the face.”
2KI.14.9	Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle. 
2KI.14.10	You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your harm, that you fall, even you, and Judah with you?’” 
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 
2KI.14.12	Judah was defeated by Israel; and each man fled to his tent. 
2KI.14.13	Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2KI.14.14	He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the 
2KI.14.15	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
2KI.14.16	Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his place.
2KI.14.17	Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
2KI.14.18	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.14.19	They made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there. 
2KI.14.20	They brought him on horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in David’s city.
2KI.14.21	All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah. 
2KI.14.22	He built Elath, and restored it to Judah. After that the king slept with his fathers.

2KI.15.9	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.15.10	Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him before the people, and killed him, and reigned in his place. 
2KI.15.11	Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

2KI.15.14	Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, came to Samaria, struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, killed him, and reigned in his place. 
2KI.15.15	Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.16	Then Menahem attacked Tiphsah, and all who were in it, and its border areas, from Tirzah. He attacked it because they didn’t open their gates to him, and he ripped up all their women who were with child. 
2KI.15.17	In the thirty ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel for ten years in Samaria. 
2KI.15.18	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.15.19	Pul the king of Assyria came against the land, and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents
2KI.15.20	Menahem exacted the money from Israel, even from all the mighty men of wealth, from each man fifty shekels

2KI.15.29	In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria. 
2KI.15.30	Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, attacked him, killed him, and reigned in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 
2KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

2KI.15.34	He did that which was right in the 
2KI.15.35	However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the 
2KI.15.36	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.15.37	In those days, the 
2KI.15.38	Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in his father David’s city, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
2KI.16.1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.16.2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He didn’t do that which was right in the 
2KI.16.3	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the 
2KI.16.4	He sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree. 
2KI.16.5	Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war. They besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him. 
2KI.16.6	At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and lived there, to this day. 
2KI.16.7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.” 
2KI.16.8	Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the 
2KI.16.9	The king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin. 
2KI.16.10	King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest a drawing of the altar and plans to build it. 
2KI.16.11	Urijah the priest built an altar. According to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus. 
2KI.16.12	When the king had come from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king came near to the altar, and offered on it. 
2KI.16.13	He burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering, poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar. 
2KI.16.14	The bronze altar, which was before the 
2KI.16.15	King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, the evening meal offering, the king’s burnt offering, his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their meal offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the bronze altar will be for me to enquire by.” 
2KI.16.16	Urijah the priest did so, according to all that king Ahaz commanded. 
2KI.16.17	King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone. 
2KI.16.18	He removed the covered way for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry outside to the 
2KI.16.19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.16.20	Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city, and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel for nine years. 
2KI.17.2	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.17.3	Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute. 
2KI.17.4	The king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria seized him, and bound him in prison. 
2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. 
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. 
2KI.17.7	It was so because the children of Israel had sinned against the 
2KI.17.8	and walked in the statutes of the nations whom the 
2KI.17.9	The children of Israel secretly did things that were not right against the 
2KI.17.10	and they set up for themselves pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill, and under every green tree; 
2KI.17.11	and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as the nations whom the 
2KI.17.12	and they served idols, of which the 
2KI.17.13	Yet the 
2KI.17.14	Notwithstanding, they would not listen, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who didn’t believe in the 
2KI.17.15	They rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom the 
2KI.17.16	They abandoned all the commandments of the 
2KI.17.17	They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the 
2KI.17.18	Therefore the 
2KI.17.19	Also Judah didn’t keep the commandments of the 
2KI.17.20	The 
2KI.17.21	For he tore Israel from David’s house; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the 
2KI.17.22	The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn’t depart from them 
2KI.17.23	until the 
2KI.17.24	The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, from Cuthah, from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and lived in its cities. 
2KI.17.25	So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn’t fear the 
2KI.17.26	Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria don’t know the law of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions amongst them, and behold, they kill them, because they don’t know the law of the god of the land.”
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.”
2KI.17.28	So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the 
2KI.17.29	However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived. 
2KI.17.30	The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
2KI.17.31	and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
2KI.17.32	So they feared the 
2KI.17.33	They feared the 
2KI.17.34	To this day they do what they did before. They don’t fear the 
2KI.17.35	with whom the 
2KI.17.36	but you shall fear the 
2KI.17.37	The statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever more. You shall not fear other gods. 
2KI.17.38	You shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods. 
2KI.17.39	But you shall fear the 
2KI.17.40	However they didn’t listen, but they did what they did before. 
2KI.17.41	So these nations feared the 
2KI.18.1	Now in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. 
2KI.18.2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. 
2KI.18.3	He did that which was right in the 
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, because in those days the children of Israel burnt incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan. 
2KI.18.5	He trusted in the 
2KI.18.6	For he joined with the 
2KI.18.7	The 
2KI.18.8	He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
2KI.18.9	In the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. 
2KI.18.10	At the end of three years they took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. 
2KI.18.11	The king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, 
2KI.18.12	because they didn’t obey the 
2KI.18.13	Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them. 
2KI.18.14	Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, “I have offended you. Return from me. That which you put on me, I will bear.” The king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents
2KI.18.15	Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the 
2KI.18.16	At that time, Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the 
2KI.18.17	The king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field. 
2KI.18.18	When they had called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came out to them. 
2KI.18.19	Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says, “What confidence is this in which you trust? 
2KI.18.20	You say (but they are but vain words), ‘There is counsel and strength for war.’ Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? 
2KI.18.21	Now, behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt. If a man leans on it, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him. 
2KI.18.22	But if you tell me, ‘We trust in the 
2KI.18.23	Now therefore, please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. 
2KI.18.24	How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
2KI.18.25	Have I now come up without the 
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it. Don’t speak with us in the Jews’ language, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”
2KI.18.27	But Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you, to speak these words? Hasn’t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?” 
2KI.18.28	Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spoke, saying, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
2KI.18.29	The king says, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand. 
2KI.18.30	Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
2KI.18.31	Don’t listen to Hezekiah.’ For the king of Assyria says, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone of you eat from his own vine, and everyone from his own fig tree, and everyone drink water from his own cistern; 
2KI.18.32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die. Don’t listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, “The 
2KI.18.33	Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 
2KI.18.35	Who are they amongst all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the 
2KI.18.36	But the people stayed quiet, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.” 
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, came with Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him Rabshakeh’s words.
2KI.19.1	When king Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the 
2KI.19.2	He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
2KI.19.3	They said to him, “Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them. 
2KI.19.4	It may be the 
2KI.19.5	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
2KI.19.6	Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master this: ‘The 
2KI.19.7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”
2KI.19.8	So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish. 
2KI.19.9	When he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “Behold, he has come out to fight against you, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying, 
2KI.19.10	‘Tell Hezekiah king of Judah this: “Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
2KI.19.11	Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Will you be delivered? 
2KI.19.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar? 
2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?”’”
2KI.19.14	Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the 
2KI.19.15	Hezekiah prayed before the 
2KI.19.16	Incline your ear, 
2KI.19.17	Truly, 
2KI.19.18	and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them. 
2KI.19.19	Now therefore, 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “The 
2KI.19.21	This is the word that the 
2KI.19.22	Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel! 
2KI.19.23	By your messengers, you have defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots, I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon, and I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees; and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field. 
2KI.19.24	I have dug and drunk strange waters, and I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt with the sole of my feet.” 
2KI.19.25	Haven’t you heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps. 
2KI.19.26	Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like grain blasted before it has grown up. 
2KI.19.27	But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me. 
2KI.19.28	Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.’
2KI.19.29	“This will be the sign to you: This year, you will eat that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from that; and in the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat its fruit. 
2KI.19.30	The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. 
2KI.19.31	For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape. The 
2KI.19.32	“Therefore the 
2KI.19.33	He will return the same way that he came, and he will not come to this city,’ says the 
2KI.19.34	‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.’”
2KI.19.35	That night, the 
2KI.19.36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh. 
2KI.19.37	As he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.
2KI.20.1	In those days Hezekiah was sick and dying. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “The 
2KI.20.2	Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the 
2KI.20.3	“Remember now, 
2KI.20.4	Before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city, the 
2KI.20.5	“Turn back, and tell Hezekiah the prince of my people, ‘The 
2KI.20.6	I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.”’”
2KI.20.7	Isaiah said, “Take a cake of figs.”
2KI.20.7	They took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. 
2KI.20.8	Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the 
2KI.20.9	Isaiah said, “This will be the sign to you from the 
2KI.20.10	Hezekiah answered, “It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. No, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.”
2KI.20.11	Isaiah the prophet cried to the 
2KI.20.12	At that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. 
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the storehouse of his precious things, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, or in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them.
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?”
2KI.20.14	Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, even from Babylon.”
2KI.20.15	He said, “What have they seen in your house?”
2KI.20.15	Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing amongst my treasures that I have not shown them.”
2KI.20.16	Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the 
2KI.20.17	‘Behold, the days come that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says the 
2KI.20.18	‘They will take away some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will father; and they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”
2KI.20.19	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The 
2KI.20.20	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.20.21	Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah. 
2KI.21.2	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.21.3	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he raised up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel did, and worshipped all the army of the sky, and served them. 
2KI.21.4	He built altars in the 
2KI.21.5	He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the 
2KI.21.6	He made his son to pass through the fire, practised sorcery, used enchantments, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards. He did much evil in the 
2KI.21.7	He set the engraved image of Asherah that he had made in the house of which the 
2KI.21.8	I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.” 
2KI.21.9	But they didn’t listen, and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than the nations did whom the 
2KI.21.10	The 
2KI.21.11	“Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has also made Judah to sin with his idols; 
2KI.21.12	therefore the 
2KI.21.13	I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of Ahab’s house; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. 
2KI.21.14	I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hands of their enemies. They will become a prey and a plunder to all their enemies, 
2KI.21.15	because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.’”
2KI.21.16	Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; in addition to his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the 
2KI.21.17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.18	Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his place.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.21.21	He walked in all the ways that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them; 
2KI.21.22	and he abandoned the 
2KI.21.23	The servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house. 
2KI.21.24	But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place. 
2KI.21.25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.21.26	He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son reigned in his place.
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. 
2KI.22.2	He did that which was right in the 
2KI.22.3	In the eighteenth year of king Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the 
2KI.22.4	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money which is brought into the 
2KI.22.5	Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the 
2KI.22.6	to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house. 
2KI.22.7	However no accounting shall be made with them of the money delivered into their hand; for they deal faithfully.”
2KI.22.8	Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in the 
2KI.22.9	Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hands of the workmen who have the oversight of the 
2KI.22.10	Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me.” Then Shaphan read it before the king.
2KI.22.11	When the king had heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. 
2KI.22.12	The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying, 
2KI.22.13	“Go enquire of the 
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with her. 
2KI.22.15	She said to them, “The 
2KI.22.16	“The 
2KI.22.17	Because they have forsaken me, and have burnt incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.’” 
2KI.22.18	But to the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of The 
2KI.22.19	because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before the 
2KI.22.20	‘Therefore behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place.’”’” So they brought this message back to the king.
2KI.23.1	The king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. 
2KI.23.2	The king went up to the 
2KI.23.3	The king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before the 
2KI.23.4	The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of the 
2KI.23.5	He got rid of the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; those also who burnt incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the army of the sky. 
2KI.23.6	He brought out the Asherah from the 
2KI.23.7	He broke down the houses of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the 
2KI.23.8	He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burnt incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city. 
2KI.23.9	Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn’t come up to the 
2KI.23.10	He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. 
2KI.23.11	He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the 
2KI.23.12	The king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the 
2KI.23.13	The king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon. 
2KI.23.14	He broke in pieces the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with men’s bones. 
2KI.23.15	Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burnt the high place and beat it to dust, and burnt the Asherah. 
2KI.23.16	As Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burnt them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the 
2KI.23.17	Then he said, “What monument is that which I see?”
2KI.23.17	The men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.”
2KI.23.18	He said, “Let him be! Let no one move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria. 
2KI.23.19	All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the 
2KI.23.20	He killed all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burnt men’s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem.
2KI.23.21	The king commanded all the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to the 
2KI.23.22	Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; 
2KI.23.23	but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, this Passover was kept to the 
2KI.23.24	Moreover Josiah removed those who had familiar spirits, the wizards, and the teraphim,
2KI.23.25	There was no king like him before him, who turned to the 
2KI.23.26	Notwithstanding, the 
2KI.23.27	The 
2KI.23.28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.23.29	In his days Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and king Josiah went against him; and Pharaoh Necoh killed him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. 
2KI.23.30	His servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.23.33	Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent
2KI.23.34	Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but he took Jehoahaz away, and he came to Egypt and died there. 
2KI.23.35	Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, from everyone according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Necoh. 
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
2KI.23.37	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.24.1	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years. Then he turned and rebelled against him. 
2KI.24.2	The 
2KI.24.3	Surely at the commandment of the 
2KI.24.4	and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the 
2KI.24.5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
2KI.24.6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
2KI.24.7	The king of Egypt didn’t come out of his land any more; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that belonged to the king of Egypt.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.24.10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. 
2KI.24.11	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it, 
2KI.24.12	and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers; and the king of Babylon captured him in the eighth year of his reign. 
2KI.24.13	He carried out from there all the treasures of the 
2KI.24.14	He carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths. No one remained, except the poorest people of the land. 
2KI.24.15	He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, with the king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officers, and the chief men of the land. He carried them into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
2KI.24.16	All the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand, all of them strong and fit for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. 
2KI.24.17	The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s father’s brother, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah. 
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
2KI.24.19	He did that which was evil in the 
2KI.24.20	For through the anger of the 
2KI.24.20	Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2KI.25.1	In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it around it. 
2KI.25.2	So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
2KI.25.3	On the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. 
2KI.25.4	Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city around it); and the king went by the way of the Arabah. 
2KI.25.5	But the Chaldean army pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. 
2KI.25.6	Then they captured the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they passed judgement on him. 
2KI.25.7	They killed Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, then put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.9	He burnt the 
2KI.25.10	All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.11	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude. 
2KI.25.12	But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields. 
2KI.25.13	The Chaldeans broke up the pillars of bronze that were in the 
2KI.25.14	They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered. 
2KI.25.15	The captain of the guard took away the fire pans, the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver. 
2KI.25.16	The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the 
2KI.25.17	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits,
2KI.25.18	The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold; 
2KI.25.19	and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the city. 
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	The king of Babylon attacked them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land. 
2KI.25.22	As for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor. 
2KI.25.23	Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. 
2KI.25.24	Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said to them, “Don’t be afraid because of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.”
2KI.25.25	But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedaliah, so that he died, with the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah. 
2KI.25.26	All the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans. 
2KI.25.27	In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; 
2KI.25.28	and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon, 
2KI.25.29	and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life; 
2KI.25.30	and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him from the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.

1CH.11.5	The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. The same is David’s city. 
1CH.11.6	David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief. 
1CH.11.7	David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it David’s city.

1CH.11.13	He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. 
1CH.11.14	They stood in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the 
1CH.11.15	Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.11.16	David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time. 
1CH.11.17	David longed, and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”
1CH.11.18	The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink any of it, but poured it out to the 
1CH.11.19	and said, “My God forbid me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.
1CH.11.20	Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name amongst the three. 
1CH.11.21	Of the three, he was more honourable than the two, and was made their captain; however he wasn’t included in the three. 
1CH.11.22	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day. 
1CH.11.23	He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits
1CH.11.24	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name amongst the three mighty men. 
1CH.11.25	Behold, he was more honourable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three; and David set him over his guard.
1CH.11.26	The mighty men of the armies also include Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
1CH.11.27	Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 
1CH.11.28	Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, 
1CH.11.29	Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 
1CH.11.30	Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, 
1CH.11.31	Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 
1CH.11.32	Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 
1CH.11.33	Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 
1CH.11.34	the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite, 
1CH.11.35	Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 
1CH.11.36	Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 
1CH.11.37	Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, 
1CH.11.38	Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, 
1CH.11.39	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armour bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
1CH.11.40	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
1CH.11.41	Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 
1CH.11.42	Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, 
1CH.11.43	Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 
1CH.11.44	Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, 
1CH.11.45	Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, 
1CH.11.46	Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite, 
1CH.11.47	Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
1CH.12.1	Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag, while he was a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish. They were amongst the mighty men, his helpers in war. 
1CH.12.2	They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow. They were of Saul’s relatives of the tribe of Benjamin. 
1CH.12.3	The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite; 
1CH.12.4	Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man amongst the thirty and a leader of the thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad the Gederathite; 
1CH.12.5	Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Haruphite; 
1CH.12.6	Elkanah, Isshiah Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; 
1CH.12.7	and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 
1CH.12.8	Some Gadites joined David in the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valour, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains: 
1CH.12.9	Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
1CH.12.10	Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 
1CH.12.11	Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
1CH.12.12	Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
1CH.12.13	Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh. 
1CH.12.14	These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army: he who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest to one thousand. 
1CH.12.15	These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all who lived in the valleys, both towards the east and towards the west. 
1CH.12.16	Some of the children of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David. 
1CH.12.17	David went out to meet them, and answered them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see this and rebuke it.” 
1CH.12.18	Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, “We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse. Peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.” Then David received them, and made them captains of the band. 
1CH.12.19	Some of Manasseh also joined David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle; but they didn’t help them; for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.”
1CH.12.20	As he went to Ziklag, some from Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh. 
1CH.12.21	They helped David against the band of rovers; for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the army. 
1CH.12.22	For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like God’s army.
1CH.12.23	These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the 
1CH.12.24	The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war. 
1CH.12.25	Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war: seven thousand and one hundred. 
1CH.12.26	Of the children of Levi: four thousand and six hundred. 
1CH.12.27	Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron; and with him were three thousand and seven hundred, 
1CH.12.28	and Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house twenty-two captains. 
1CH.12.29	Of the children of Benjamin, Saul’s relatives: three thousand, for until then, the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to Saul’s house. 
1CH.12.30	Of the children of Ephraim: twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous men in their fathers’ houses. 
1CH.12.31	Of the half-tribe of Manasseh: eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king. 
1CH.12.32	Of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their heads were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their command. 
1CH.12.33	Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, with all kinds of instruments of war: fifty thousand who could command and were not of double heart. 
1CH.12.34	Of Naphtali: one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand. 
1CH.12.35	Of the Danites who could set the battle in array: twenty-eight thousand and six hundred. 
1CH.12.36	Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array: forty thousand. 
1CH.12.37	On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle: one hundred and twenty thousand. 
1CH.12.38	All these were men of war, who could order the battle array, and came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. 
1CH.12.39	They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had supplied provisions for them. 
1CH.12.40	Moreover those who were near to them, as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, on camels, on mules, and on oxen: supplies of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Israel.
1CH.13.1	David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader. 
1CH.13.2	David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is of the 
1CH.13.3	Also, let’s bring the ark of our God back to us again; for we didn’t seek it in the days of Saul.”
1CH.13.4	All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. 
1CH.13.5	So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor River of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring God’s ark from Kiriath Jearim.
1CH.13.6	David went up with all Israel to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there God the 
1CH.13.7	They carried God’s ark on a new cart, and brought it out of Abinadab’s house; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. 
1CH.13.8	David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, with harps, with stringed instruments, with tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
1CH.13.9	When they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. 
1CH.13.10	The 
1CH.13.11	David was displeased, because the 
1CH.13.12	David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring God’s ark home to me?” 
1CH.13.13	So David didn’t move the ark with him into David’s city, but carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house. 
1CH.13.14	God’s ark remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months; and the 
1CH.14.1	Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. 
1CH.14.2	David perceived that the 
1CH.14.3	David took more wives at Jerusalem, and David became the father of more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out against them. 
1CH.14.9	Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.14.10	David enquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?”
1CH.14.10	The 
1CH.14.11	So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like waters breaking out. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
1CH.14.12	They left their gods there; and David gave a command, and they were burnt with fire.
1CH.14.13	The Philistines made a another raid in the valley. 
1CH.14.14	David enquired again of God; and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them opposite the mulberry trees. 
1CH.14.15	When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”
1CH.14.16	David did as God commanded him; and they attacked the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	The fame of David went out into all lands; and the 
1CH.15.1	David made himself houses in David’s city; and he prepared a place for God’s ark, and pitched a tent for it. 
1CH.15.2	Then David said, “No one ought to carry God’s ark but the Levites. For the 
1CH.15.3	David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the 
1CH.15.4	David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: 
1CH.15.5	of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred and twenty; 
1CH.15.6	of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred and twenty; 
1CH.15.7	of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred and thirty; 
1CH.15.8	of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred; 
1CH.15.9	of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty; 
1CH.15.10	of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred and twelve. 
1CH.15.11	David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, 
1CH.15.12	and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring the ark of the 
1CH.15.13	For because you didn’t carry it at first, the 
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.15	The children of the Levites bore God’s ark on their shoulders with its poles, as Moses commanded according to the 
1CH.15.16	David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of music, stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up their voices with joy. 
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
1CH.15.18	and with them their brothers of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers. 
1CH.15.19	So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of bronze to sound aloud; 
1CH.15.20	and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth; 
1CH.15.21	and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead. 
1CH.15.22	Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the singing. He taught the singers, because he was skilful. 
1CH.15.23	Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
1CH.15.24	Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before God’s ark; and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1CH.15.25	So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring the ark of the 
1CH.15.26	When God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the 
1CH.15.27	David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the choir master with the singers; and David had an ephod of linen on him. 
1CH.15.28	Thus all Israel brought the ark of the 
1CH.15.29	As the ark of the 
1CH.16.1	They brought in God’s ark, and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. 
1CH.16.2	When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the 
1CH.16.3	He gave to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. 
1CH.16.4	He appointed some of the Levites to minister before the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; 
1CH.16.6	with Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
1CH.16.7	Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.8	Oh give thanks to the 
1CH.16.8	Call on his name.
1CH.16.8	Make what he has done known amongst the peoples.
1CH.16.9	Sing to him.
1CH.16.9	Sing praises to him.
1CH.16.9	Tell of all his marvellous works.
1CH.16.10	Glory in his holy name.
1CH.16.10	Let the heart of those who seek the 
1CH.16.11	Seek the 
1CH.16.11	Seek his face forever more.
1CH.16.12	Remember his marvellous works that he has done,
1CH.16.12	his wonders, and the judgements of his mouth,
1CH.16.13	you offspring
1CH.16.13	you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
1CH.16.14	He is the 
1CH.16.14	His judgements are in all the earth.
1CH.16.15	Remember his covenant forever,
1CH.16.15	the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
1CH.16.16	the covenant which he made with Abraham,
1CH.16.16	his oath to Isaac.
1CH.16.17	He confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,
1CH.16.17	and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
1CH.16.18	saying, “I will give you the land of Canaan,
1CH.16.18	The lot of your inheritance,”
1CH.16.19	when you were but a few men in number,
1CH.16.19	yes, very few, and foreigners in it.
1CH.16.20	They went about from nation to nation,
1CH.16.20	from one kingdom to another people.
1CH.16.21	He allowed no man to do them wrong.
1CH.16.21	Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,
1CH.16.22	“Don’t touch my anointed ones!
1CH.16.22	Do my prophets no harm!”
1CH.16.23	Sing to the 
1CH.16.23	Display his salvation from day to day.
1CH.16.24	Declare his glory amongst the nations,
1CH.16.24	and his marvellous works amongst all the peoples.
1CH.16.25	For great is the 
1CH.16.25	He also is to be feared above all gods.
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
1CH.16.26	but the 
1CH.16.27	Honour and majesty are before him.
1CH.16.27	Strength and gladness are in his place.
1CH.16.28	Ascribe to the 
1CH.16.28	ascribe to the 
1CH.16.29	Ascribe to the 
1CH.16.29	Bring an offering, and come before him.
1CH.16.29	Worship the 
1CH.16.30	Tremble before him, all the earth.
1CH.16.30	The world also is established that it can’t be moved.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad,
1CH.16.31	and let the earth rejoice!
1CH.16.31	Let them say amongst the nations, “The 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar, and its fullness!
1CH.16.32	Let the field exult, and all that is in it!
1CH.16.33	Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the 
1CH.16.33	for he comes to judge the earth.
1CH.16.34	Oh give thanks to the 
1CH.16.34	for his loving kindness endures forever.
1CH.16.35	Say, “Save us, God of our salvation!
1CH.16.35	Gather us together and deliver us from the nations,
1CH.16.35	to give thanks to your holy name,
1CH.16.35	to triumph in your praise.”
1CH.16.36	Blessed be the 
1CH.16.36	from everlasting even to everlasting.
1CH.16.36	All the people said, “Amen,” and praised the 
1CH.16.37	So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the 
1CH.16.38	and Obed-Edom with their brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers; 
1CH.16.39	and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the 
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings to the 
1CH.16.41	and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.42	and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate. 
1CH.16.43	All the people departed, each man to his house; and David returned to bless his house.
1CH.17.1	When David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the 
1CH.17.2	Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.”
1CH.17.3	That same night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
1CH.17.4	“Go and tell David my servant, ‘The 
1CH.17.5	for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another. 
1CH.17.6	In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’
1CH.17.7	“Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, ‘The 
1CH.17.8	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. 
1CH.17.9	I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first, 
1CH.17.10	and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that the 
1CH.17.11	It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your offspring after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 
1CH.17.12	He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. 
1CH.17.13	I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you; 
1CH.17.14	but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne will be established forever.”’” 
1CH.17.15	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
1CH.17.16	Then David the king went in, and sat before the 
1CH.17.17	This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the standard of a man of high degree, 
1CH.17.18	What can David say yet more to you concerning the honour which is done to your servant? For you know your servant. 
1CH.17.19	, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things. 
1CH.17.20	, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
1CH.17.21	What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed out of Egypt? 
1CH.17.22	For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, 
1CH.17.23	Now, 
1CH.17.24	Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘The 
1CH.17.25	For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you. 
1CH.17.26	Now, 
1CH.17.27	Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, 
1CH.18.1	After this, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 
1CH.18.2	He defeated Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute. 
1CH.18.3	David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 
1CH.18.4	David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them enough for one hundred chariots. 
1CH.18.5	When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians. 
1CH.18.6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. The 
1CH.18.7	David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, the pillars, and the vessels of bronze.
1CH.18.9	When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 
1CH.18.10	he sent Hadoram his son to king David to Greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and bronze. 
1CH.18.11	King David also dedicated these to the 
1CH.18.12	Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
1CH.18.13	He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. The 
1CH.18.14	David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness for all his people. 
1CH.18.15	Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 
1CH.18.16	Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was scribe; 
1CH.18.17	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief officials serving the king.
1CH.19.1	After this, Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place. 
1CH.19.2	David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.”
1CH.19.2	So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun to comfort him. 
1CH.19.3	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honours your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?” 
1CH.19.4	So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away. 
1CH.19.5	Then some people went and told David how the men were treated. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”
1CH.19.6	When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents
1CH.19.7	So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people, who came and encamped near Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 
1CH.19.8	When David heard of it, he sent Joab with all the army of the mighty men. 
1CH.19.9	The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. 
1CH.19.10	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose some of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. 
1CH.19.11	The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon. 
1CH.19.12	He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you. 
1CH.19.13	Be courageous, and let’s be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May the 
1CH.19.14	So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him. 
1CH.19.15	When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and called out the Syrians who were beyond the River,
1CH.19.17	David was told that; so he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, came to them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. 
1CH.19.18	The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrian men seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and also killed Shophach the captain of the army. 
1CH.19.19	When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and served him. The Syrians would not help the children of Ammon any more.
1CH.20.1	At the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, Joab led out the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it. 
1CH.20.2	David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold,
1CH.20.3	He brought out the people who were in it, and had them cut with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.20.4	After this, war arose at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.
1CH.20.5	Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
1CH.20.6	There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant. 
1CH.20.7	When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother killed him. 
1CH.20.8	These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
1CH.21.1	Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to take a census of Israel. 
1CH.21.2	David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are.”
1CH.21.3	Joab said, “May the 
1CH.21.4	Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	Joab gave up the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew a sword. 
1CH.21.6	But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin amongst them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.
1CH.21.7	God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel. 
1CH.21.8	David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.”
1CH.21.9	The 
1CH.21.10	“Go and speak to David, saying, ‘The 
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David, and said to him, “The 
1CH.21.12	either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of the 
1CH.21.13	David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, the 
1CH.21.16	David lifted up his eyes, and saw the 
1CH.21.16	Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces. 
1CH.21.17	David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O 
1CH.21.18	Then the 
1CH.21.19	David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the 
1CH.21.20	Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
1CH.21.21	As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to the 
1CH.21.23	Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.”
1CH.21.24	King David said to Ornan, “No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for the 
1CH.21.25	So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels
1CH.21.26	David built an altar to the 
1CH.21.27	Then The 
1CH.21.28	At that time, when David saw that the 
1CH.21.29	For the 
1CH.21.30	But David couldn’t go before it to enquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the 
1CH.22.1	Then David said, “This is the house of the 
1CH.22.2	David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut dressed stones to build God’s house. 
1CH.22.3	David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and bronze in abundance without weight; 
1CH.22.4	and cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David. 
1CH.22.5	David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the 
1CH.22.6	Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for the 
1CH.22.7	David said to Solomon his son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of the 
1CH.22.8	But the 
1CH.22.9	Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. 
1CH.22.10	He shall build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ 
1CH.22.11	Now, my son, may the 
1CH.22.12	May the 
1CH.22.13	Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which the 
1CH.22.14	Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the 
1CH.22.15	There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skilful in every kind of work; 
1CH.22.16	of the gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may the 
1CH.22.17	David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 
1CH.22.18	“Isn’t the 
1CH.22.19	Now set your heart and your soul to follow the 
1CH.23.1	Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
1CH.23.2	He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
1CH.23.3	The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand. 
1CH.23.4	David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the 
1CH.23.5	four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised the 
1CH.23.6	David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1CH.23.7	Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei. 
1CH.23.8	The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three. 
1CH.23.9	The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan. 
1CH.23.10	The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. 
1CH.23.11	Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before the 
1CH.23.14	But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named amongst the tribe of Levi. 
1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 
1CH.23.16	The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 
1CH.23.17	The sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

1CH.23.21	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. 
1CH.23.22	Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives. 
1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
1CH.23.24	These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the 
1CH.23.25	For David said, “The 
1CH.23.26	Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.” 
1CH.23.27	For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward. 
1CH.23.28	For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the 
1CH.23.29	for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all measurements of quantity and size; 
1CH.23.30	and to stand every morning to thank and praise the 
1CH.23.31	and to offer all burnt offerings to the 
1CH.23.32	and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service of the 
1CH.24.1	These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
1CH.24.2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office. 
1CH.24.3	David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service. 
1CH.24.4	There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight. 
1CH.24.5	Thus they were divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
1CH.24.6	Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

1CH.24.31	These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; the fathers’ households of the chief even as those of his younger brother.
1CH.25.1	Moreover, David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments, and with cymbals. The number of those who did the work according to their service was: 
1CH.25.2	of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah. The sons of Asaph were under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied at the order of the king.

1CH.26.32	His brothers, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred, heads of fathers’ households, whom king David made overseers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God, and for the affairs of the king.
1CH.27.1	Now the children of Israel after their number, the heads of fathers’ households and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the king, in any matter of the divisions which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year—of every division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.2	Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.3	He was of the children of Perez, the chief of all the captains of the army for the first month. 
1CH.27.4	Over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite, and his division; and Mikloth the ruler: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.5	The third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the chief priest. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.6	This is that Benaiah who was the mighty man of the thirty, and over the thirty: and of his division was Ammizabad his son. 
1CH.27.7	The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.8	The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.9	The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.10	The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.11	The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zerahites. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.12	The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjamites. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.13	The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zerahites. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.14	The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.15	The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
1CH.27.16	Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: of the Reubenites, Eliezer the son of Zichri was the ruler; of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah; 
1CH.27.17	of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; of Aaron, Zadok; 
1CH.27.18	of Judah, Elihu, one of the brothers of David; of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael; 
1CH.27.19	of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah; of Naphtali, Jeremoth the son of Azriel; 
1CH.27.20	of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah; of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah; 
1CH.27.21	of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah; of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner; 
1CH.27.22	of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel. 
1CH.27.23	But David didn’t take the number of them from twenty years old and under, because the 
1CH.27.24	Joab the son of Zeruiah began to take a census, but didn’t finish; and wrath came on Israel for this. The number wasn’t put into the account in the chronicles of king David.
1CH.27.25	Over the king’s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah; 
1CH.27.26	Over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub; 
1CH.27.27	and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite; and over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite; 
1CH.27.28	and over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowland was Baal Hanan the Gederite; and over the cellars of oil was Joash; 
1CH.27.29	and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite; and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai; 
1CH.27.30	and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite; and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite; and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite. 
1CH.27.31	All these were the rulers of the property which was king David’s.
1CH.27.32	Also Jonathan, David’s uncle, was a counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe. Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons. 
1CH.27.33	Ahithophel was the king’s counsellor. Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend. 
1CH.27.34	After Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. Joab was the captain of the king’s army.
1CH.28.1	David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, the captains of the companies who served the king by division, the captains of thousands, the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valour, to Jerusalem. 
1CH.28.2	Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, “Hear me, my brothers, and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the 
1CH.28.3	But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.’ 
1CH.28.4	However the 
1CH.28.5	Of all my sons (for the 
1CH.28.6	He said to me, ‘Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. 
1CH.28.7	I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as it is today.’
1CH.28.8	Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the 
1CH.28.9	You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for the 
1CH.28.10	Take heed now; for the 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave to Solomon his son the plans for the porch of the temple, for its houses, for its treasuries, for its upper rooms, for its inner rooms, for the place of the mercy seat; 
1CH.28.12	and the plans of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the 
1CH.28.13	also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of the 
1CH.28.14	of gold by weight for the gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service; 
1CH.28.15	by weight also for the lamp stands of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps; and for the lamp stands of silver, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps, according to the use of every lamp stand; 
1CH.28.16	and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver; 
1CH.28.17	and the forks, the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl; 
1CH.28.18	and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the plans for the chariot, and the cherubim that spread out and cover the ark of the 
1CH.28.19	“All this”, David said, “I have been made to understand in writing from the 
1CH.28.20	David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed; for the 
1CH.28.21	Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of God’s house. Every willing man who has skill, for any kind of service, shall be with you in all kinds of work. Also the captains and all the people will be entirely at your command.”
1CH.29.1	David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for the 
1CH.29.2	Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, the bronze for the things of bronze, iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; also onyx stones, stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, of various colours, all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 
1CH.29.3	In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, 
1CH.29.4	even three thousand talents of gold,
1CH.29.5	of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself today to the 
1CH.29.6	Then the princes of the fathers’ households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly; 
1CH.29.7	and they gave for the service of God’s house of gold five thousand talents
1CH.29.8	People with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to the 
1CH.29.10	Therefore David blessed the 
1CH.29.11	Yours, 
1CH.29.12	Both riches and honour come from you, and you rule over all! In your hand is power and might! It is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all! 
1CH.29.13	Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name. 
1CH.29.14	But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and we have given you of your own. 
1CH.29.15	For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining. 
1CH.29.16	 our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own. 
1CH.29.17	I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now I have seen with joy your people, who are present here, offer willingly to you. 
1CH.29.18	, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you; 
1CH.29.19	and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.”
1CH.29.20	Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless the 
1CH.29.20	All the assembly blessed the 
1CH.29.21	They sacrificed sacrifices to the 
1CH.29.22	and ate and drank before the 
1CH.29.23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the 
1CH.29.24	All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king. 
1CH.29.25	The 
1CH.29.26	Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
1CH.29.28	He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour; and Solomon his son reigned in his place. 
1CH.29.29	Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer, 
1CH.29.30	with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
2CH.1.1	Solomon the son of David was firmly established in his kingdom, and the 
2CH.1.2	Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ households. 
2CH.1.3	So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for God’s Tent of Meeting was there, which the 
2CH.1.4	But David had brought God’s ark up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.5	Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before the 
2CH.1.6	Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the 
2CH.1.7	That night, God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for what you want me to give you.”
2CH.1.8	Solomon said to God, “You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place. 
2CH.1.9	Now, 
2CH.1.10	Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of yours?”
2CH.1.11	God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, honour, or the life of those who hate you, nor yet have you asked for long life; but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king, 
2CH.1.12	therefore wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you, and none after you will have.”
2CH.1.13	So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.
2CH.1.14	Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.15	The king made silver and gold to be as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars to be as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland. 
2CH.1.16	The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue. The king’s merchants purchased them from Kue. 
2CH.1.17	They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty.
2CH.2.1	Now Solomon decided to build a house for the 
2CH.2.2	Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them. 
2CH.2.3	Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, “As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me. 
2CH.2.4	Behold,
2CH.2.5	“The house which I am building will be great; for our God is greater than all gods. 
2CH.2.6	But who is able to build him a house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense before him?
2CH.2.7	“Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skilful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
2CH.2.8	“Send me also cedar trees, cypress trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. Behold, my servants will be with your servants, 
2CH.2.9	even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful. 
2CH.2.10	Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand cors
2CH.2.11	Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, “Because the 
2CH.2.12	Huram continued, “Blessed be the 
2CH.2.13	Now I have sent a skilful man, endowed with understanding, Huram-abi,
2CH.2.14	the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, in timber, and in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any kind of engraving and to devise any device; that there may be a place appointed to him with your skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David your father.
2CH.2.15	“Now therefore the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants; 
2CH.2.16	and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you need. We will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa; then you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.”
2CH.2.17	Solomon counted all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the census with which David his father had counted them; and they found one hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred. 
2CH.2.18	He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to assign the people their work.
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the 
2CH.3.2	He began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. 
2CH.3.3	Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God’s house. The length by cubits
2CH.3.4	The porch that was in front, its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold. 
2CH.3.5	He made the larger room with a ceiling of cypress wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains. 
2CH.3.6	He decorated the house with precious stones for beauty. The gold was gold from Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	He also overlaid the house, the beams, the thresholds, its walls, and its doors with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls.
2CH.3.8	He made the most holy place. Its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
2CH.3.9	The weight of the nails was fifty shekels
2CH.3.10	In the most holy place he made two cherubim by carving; and they overlaid them with gold. 
2CH.3.11	The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. 
2CH.3.12	The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, joining to the wing of the other cherub. 
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubim spread themselves out twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, and their faces were towards the house. 
2CH.3.14	He made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim.
2CH.3.15	Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits height, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits. 
2CH.3.16	He made chains in the inner sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. 
2CH.3.17	He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
2CH.4.1	Then he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits
2CH.4.2	Also he made the molten sea
2CH.4.3	Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast. 
2CH.4.4	It stood on twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward. 
2CH.4.5	It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It received and held three thousand baths.
2CH.4.6	He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them. The things that belonged to the burnt offering were washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
2CH.4.7	He made the ten lamp stands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. 
2CH.4.8	He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. He made one hundred basins of gold. 
2CH.4.9	Furthermore he made the court of the priests, the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze. 
2CH.4.10	He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, towards the south.
2CH.4.11	Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins.
2CH.4.11	So Huram finished doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God’s house: 
2CH.4.12	the two pillars, the bowls, the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, 
2CH.4.13	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars. 
2CH.4.14	He also made the bases, and he made the basins on the bases; 
2CH.4.15	one sea, and the twelve oxen under it. 
2CH.4.16	Huram his father also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for king Solomon, for the 
2CH.4.17	The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. 
2CH.4.18	Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance; for the weight of the bronze could not be determined.
2CH.4.19	Solomon made all the vessels that were in God’s house, the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them; 
2CH.4.20	and the lamp stands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; 
2CH.4.21	and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold that was perfect gold; 
2CH.4.22	and the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans of pure gold. As for the entry of the house, its inner doors for the most holy place and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold.
2CH.5.1	Thus all the work that Solomon did for the 
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the 
2CH.5.3	So all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month. 
2CH.5.4	All the elders of Israel came. The Levites took up the ark; 
2CH.5.5	and they brought up the ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these the Levitical priests brought up. 
2CH.5.6	King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered for multitude. 
2CH.5.7	The priests brought in the ark of the 
2CH.5.8	For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above. 
2CH.5.9	The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark in front of the inner sanctuary; but they were not seen outside; and it is there to this day. 
2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put at Horeb, when the 
2CH.5.11	When the priests had come out of the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and didn’t keep their divisions; 
2CH.5.12	also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets); 
2CH.5.13	when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the 
2CH.5.13	“For he is good;
2CH.5.13	for his loving kindness endures forever!”
2CH.5.13	then the house was filled with a cloud, even the 
2CH.5.14	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the 
2CH.6.1	Then Solomon said, “The 
2CH.6.2	But I have built you a house and home, a place for you to dwell in forever.”
2CH.6.3	The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.
2CH.6.4	He said, “Blessed be the 
2CH.6.5	‘Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there and I chose no man to be prince over my people Israel; 
2CH.6.6	but now I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ 
2CH.6.7	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the 
2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who will come out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.’
2CH.6.10	“The 
2CH.6.11	There I have set the ark, in which is the 
2CH.6.12	He stood before the 
2CH.6.13	(for Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits
2CH.6.14	and he said, “
2CH.6.15	who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is today.
2CH.6.16	“Now therefore, 
2CH.6.17	Now therefore, 
2CH.6.18	“But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain you; how much less this house which I have built! 
2CH.6.19	Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, 
2CH.6.20	that your eyes may be open towards this house day and night, even towards the place where you have said that you would put your name; to listen to the prayer which your servant will pray towards this place. 
2CH.6.21	Listen to the petitions of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they pray towards this place. Yes, hear from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive.
2CH.6.22	“If a man sins against his neighbour, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house; 
2CH.6.23	then hear from heaven, act, and judge your servants, bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring his way on his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
2CH.6.24	“If your people Israel are struck down before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and they turn again and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house; 
2CH.6.25	then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.
2CH.6.26	“When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray towards this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them; 
2CH.6.27	then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
2CH.6.28	“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is; 
2CH.6.29	whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who will each know his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread out his hands towards this house; 
2CH.6.30	then hear from heaven your dwelling place and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know (for you, even you only, know the hearts of the children of men) 
2CH.6.31	that they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.
2CH.6.32	“Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he comes from a far country for your great name’s sake, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; when they come and pray towards this house; 
2CH.6.33	then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.
2CH.6.34	“If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you send them, and they pray to you towards this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name; 
2CH.6.35	then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
2CH.6.36	“If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn’t sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near; 
2CH.6.37	yet if they come to their senses in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;’ 
2CH.6.38	if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captive, and pray towards their land, which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and towards the house which I have built for your name; 
2CH.6.39	then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.
2CH.6.40	“Now, my God, let, I beg you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.
2CH.6.41	“Now therefore arise, 
2CH.6.42	“
2CH.7.1	Now when Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the 
2CH.7.2	The priests could not enter into the 
2CH.7.3	All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the 
2CH.7.3	“For he is good;
2CH.7.3	for his loving kindness endures forever.”
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the 
2CH.7.5	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated God’s house. 
2CH.7.6	The priests stood, according to their positions; the Levites also with instruments of music of the 
2CH.7.7	Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court that was before the 
2CH.7.8	So Solomon held the feast at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.
2CH.7.9	On the eighth day, they held a solemn assembly; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. 
2CH.7.10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that the 
2CH.7.11	Thus Solomon finished the 
2CH.7.12	The 
2CH.7.13	“If I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence amongst my people; 
2CH.7.14	if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. 
2CH.7.15	Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to prayer that is made in this place. 
2CH.7.16	For now I have chosen and made this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart will be there perpetually.
2CH.7.17	“As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances; 
2CH.7.18	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.’
2CH.7.19	But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; 
2CH.7.20	then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword amongst all peoples. 
2CH.7.21	This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, ‘Why has the 
2CH.7.22	They shall answer, ‘Because they abandoned the 
2CH.8.1	At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the 
2CH.8.2	Solomon built the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
2CH.8.3	Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it. 
2CH.8.4	He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	Also he built Beth Horon the upper and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 
2CH.8.6	and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
2CH.8.7	As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel; 
2CH.8.8	of their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel didn’t consume, of them Solomon conscripted forced labour to this day. 
2CH.8.9	But of the children of Israel, Solomon made no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. 
2CH.8.10	These were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two-hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people.
2CH.8.11	Solomon brought up Pharaoh’s daughter out of David’s city to the house that he had built for her; for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where the 
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the 
2CH.8.13	even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times per year, during the feast of unleavened bread, during the feast of weeks, and during the feast of booths.
2CH.8.14	He appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate, for David the man of God had so commanded. 
2CH.8.15	They didn’t depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
2CH.8.16	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared from the day of the foundation of the 
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and brought from there four hundred and fifty talents
2CH.9.1	When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to test Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great caravan, including camels that bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. When she had come to Solomon, she talked with him about all that was in her heart. 
2CH.9.2	Solomon answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything hidden from Solomon which he didn’t tell her. 
2CH.9.3	When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, 
2CH.9.4	the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers, their clothing, his cup bearers also, their clothing, and his ascent by which he went up to the 
2CH.9.5	She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom. 
2CH.9.6	However I didn’t believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold half of the greatness of your wisdom wasn’t told me. You exceed the fame that I heard! 
2CH.9.7	Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom. 
2CH.9.8	Blessed be the 
2CH.9.9	She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents
2CH.9.10	The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees
2CH.9.11	The king used algum tree wood to make terraces for the 
2CH.9.12	King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, in addition to that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents
2CH.9.14	in addition to that which the traders and merchants brought. All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
2CH.9.15	King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold. Six hundred shekels
2CH.9.16	He made three hundred shields of beaten gold. Three hundred shekels
2CH.9.17	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	There were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and armrests on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests. 
2CH.9.19	Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps. There was nothing like it made in any other kingdom. 
2CH.9.20	All king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon. 
2CH.9.21	For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with Huram’s servants. Once every three years, the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
2CH.9.22	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
2CH.9.23	All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
2CH.9.24	They each brought tribute, vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, armour, spices, horses, and mules every year. 
2CH.9.25	Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
2CH.9.26	He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. 
2CH.9.27	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as abundant as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland. 
2CH.9.28	They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt and out of all lands.
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, aren’t they written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
2CH.9.30	Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
2CH.9.31	Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in his father David’s city: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
2CH.10.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. 
2CH.10.3	They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
2CH.10.4	“Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.”
2CH.10.5	He said to them, “Come again to me after three days.”
2CH.10.5	So the people departed. 
2CH.10.6	King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, “What counsel do you give me about how to answer these people?”
2CH.10.7	They spoke to him, saying, “If you are kind to these people, please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”
2CH.10.8	But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. 
2CH.10.9	He said to them, “What counsel do you give, that we may give an answer to these people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’”
2CH.10.10	The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us;’ thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. 
2CH.10.11	Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’”
2CH.10.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.” 
2CH.10.13	The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam abandoned the counsel of the old men, 
2CH.10.14	and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”
2CH.10.15	So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was brought about by God, that the 
2CH.10.16	When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion do we have in David? We don’t have an inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So all Israel departed to their tents.
2CH.10.17	But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
2CH.10.18	Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labour; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam hurried to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
2CH.10.19	So Israel rebelled against David’s house to this day.
2CH.11.1	When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. 
2CH.11.2	But the 
2CH.11.3	“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 
2CH.11.4	‘The 
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. 
2CH.11.6	He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, oil and wine. 
2CH.11.12	He put shields and spears in every city, and made them exceedingly strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.
2CH.11.13	The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him out of all their territory. 
2CH.11.14	For the Levites left their pasture lands and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office to the 
2CH.11.15	He himself appointed priests for the high places, for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made. 
2CH.11.16	After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, those who set their hearts to seek the 
2CH.11.17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam took a wife for himself, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse. 
2CH.11.19	She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	After her, he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. 
2CH.11.22	Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the prince amongst his brothers; for he intended to make him king. 
2CH.11.23	He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city. He gave them food in abundance and he sought many wives for them.
2CH.12.1	When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned the 
2CH.12.2	In the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against the 
2CH.12.3	with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians. 
2CH.12.4	He took the fortified cities which belonged to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.12.5	Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “The 
2CH.12.6	Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, “The 
2CH.12.7	When the 
2CH.12.8	Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”
2CH.12.9	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the 
2CH.12.10	King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. 
2CH.12.11	As often as the king entered into the 
2CH.12.12	When he humbled himself, the 
2CH.12.13	So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned; for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
2CH.12.14	He did that which was evil, because he didn’t set his heart to seek the 
2CH.12.15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren’t they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, in the genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
2CH.12.16	Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in David’s city; and Abijah his son reigned in his place.
2CH.13.1	In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah. 
2CH.13.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valour. 
2CH.13.4	Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel: 
2CH.13.5	Ought you not to know that the 
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord. 
2CH.13.7	Worthless men were gathered to him, wicked fellows who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender hearted, and could not withstand them.
2CH.13.8	“Now you intend to withstand the kingdom of the 
2CH.13.9	Haven’t you driven out the priests of the 
2CH.13.10	“But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	and they burn to the 
2CH.13.12	Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don’t fight against the 
2CH.13.13	But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them; so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them. 
2CH.13.14	When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to the 
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah gave a shout. As the men of Judah shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
2CH.13.16	The children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand. 
2CH.13.17	Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter, so five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel fell down slain. 
2CH.13.18	Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the 
2CH.13.19	Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages.
2CH.13.20	Jeroboam didn’t recover strength again in the days of Abijah. The 
2CH.13.21	But Abijah grew mighty, and took for himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.
2CH.14.1	So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days, the land was quiet ten years. 
2CH.14.2	Asa did that which was good and right in the 
2CH.14.3	for he took away the foreign altars and the high places, broke down the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, 
2CH.14.4	and commanded Judah to seek the 
2CH.14.5	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images; and the kingdom was quiet before him. 
2CH.14.6	He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because the 
2CH.14.7	For he said to Judah, “Let’s build these cities, and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought the 
2CH.14.8	Asa had an army of three hundred thousand out of Judah who bore bucklers and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand out of Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valour.
2CH.14.9	Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million troops and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah. 
2CH.14.10	Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
2CH.14.11	Asa cried to the 
2CH.14.12	So the 
2CH.14.13	Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and so many of the Ethiopians fell that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the 
2CH.14.14	They struck all the cities around Gerar; for the fear of the 
2CH.14.15	They also struck the tents of livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded: 
2CH.15.2	and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin! The 
2CH.15.3	Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law. 
2CH.15.4	But when in their distress they turned to the 
2CH.15.5	In those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands. 
2CH.15.6	They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with all adversity. 
2CH.15.7	But you be strong, and don’t let your hands be slack; for your work will be rewarded.”
2CH.15.8	When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed the 
2CH.15.9	He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who lived with them out of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon; for they came to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that the 
2CH.15.10	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign. 
2CH.15.11	They sacrificed to the 
2CH.15.12	They entered into the covenant to seek the 
2CH.15.13	and that whoever would not seek the 
2CH.15.14	They swore to the 
2CH.15.15	All Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found by them. Then the 
2CH.15.16	Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; so Asa cut down her image, ground it into dust, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. 
2CH.15.17	But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 
2CH.15.18	He brought the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, gold, and vessels into God’s house. 
2CH.15.19	There was no more war to the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
2CH.16.2	Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the 
2CH.16.3	“Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.”
2CH.16.4	Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali. 
2CH.16.5	When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease. 
2CH.16.6	Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Rama, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and he built Geba and Mizpah with them.
2CH.16.7	At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the 
2CH.16.8	Weren’t the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and exceedingly many horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the 
2CH.16.9	For the 
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
2CH.16.11	Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.16.12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa was diseased in his feet. His disease was exceedingly great: yet in his disease he didn’t seek the 
2CH.16.13	Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the forty-first year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	They buried him in his own tomb, which he had dug out for himself in David’s city, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers’ art; and they made a very great fire for him.
2CH.17.1	Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. 
2CH.17.3	The 
2CH.17.4	but sought the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not in the ways of Israel. 
2CH.17.5	Therefore the 
2CH.17.6	His heart was lifted up in the ways of the 
2CH.17.7	Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; 
2CH.17.8	and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. 
2CH.17.9	They taught in Judah, having the book of the 
2CH.17.10	The fear of the 
2CH.17.11	Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats. 
2CH.17.12	Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah. 
2CH.17.13	He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valour, in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	This was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: From Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valour; 
2CH.17.15	and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand; 
2CH.17.16	and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the 
2CH.17.17	From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valour, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield; 
2CH.17.18	and next to him Jehozabad, and with him one hundred and eighty thousand ready and prepared for war. 
2CH.17.19	These were those who waited on the king, in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
2CH.18.1	Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance; and he allied himself with Ahab. 
2CH.18.2	After some years, he went down to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead. 
2CH.18.3	Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?”
2CH.18.3	He answered him, “I am as you are, and my people as your people. We will be with you in the war.” 
2CH.18.4	Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please enquire first for the 
2CH.18.5	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?”
2CH.18.5	They said, “Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of the 
2CH.18.7	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may enquire of the 
2CH.18.7	Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.”
2CH.18.8	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, “Get Micaiah the son of Imla quickly.”
2CH.18.9	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah each sat on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 
2CH.18.10	Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron and said, “The 
2CH.18.11	All the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for the 
2CH.18.12	The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Let your word therefore, please be like one of theirs, and speak good.”
2CH.18.13	Micaiah said, “As the 
2CH.18.14	When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?”
2CH.18.14	He said, “Go up, and prosper. They shall be delivered into your hand.”
2CH.18.15	The king said to him, “How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the 
2CH.18.16	He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. The 
2CH.18.17	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”
2CH.18.18	Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the 
2CH.18.19	The 
2CH.18.20	A spirit came out, stood before the 
2CH.18.20	“The 
2CH.18.21	“He said, ‘I will go, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’
2CH.18.21	“He said, ‘You will entice him, and will prevail also. Go and do so.’
2CH.18.22	“Now therefore, behold, the 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the 
2CH.18.24	Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.”
2CH.18.25	The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son; 
2CH.18.26	and say, ‘The king says, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.”’”
2CH.18.27	Micaiah said, “If you return at all in peace, the 
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. 
2CH.18.29	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle. 
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, “Don’t fight with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.”
2CH.18.31	When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel!” Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the 
2CH.18.32	When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
2CH.18.33	A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armour. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, “Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded.” 
2CH.18.34	The battle increased that day. However the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening; and at about sunset, he died.
2CH.19.1	Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked, and love those who hate the 
2CH.19.3	Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God.”
2CH.19.4	Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem; and he went out again amongst the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to the 
2CH.19.5	He set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, 
2CH.19.6	and said to the judges, “Consider what you do, for you don’t judge for man, but for the 
2CH.19.7	Now therefore let the fear of the 
2CH.19.8	Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests, and of the heads of the fathers’ households of Israel, for the judgement of the 
2CH.19.9	He commanded them, saying, “You shall do this in the fear of the 
2CH.19.10	Whenever any controversy comes to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you must warn them, that they not be guilty towards the 
2CH.19.11	Behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the 
2CH.20.1	After this, the children of Moab, the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. 
2CH.20.2	Then some came who told Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Syria. Behold, they are in Hazazon Tamar” (that is, En Gedi). 
2CH.20.3	Jehoshaphat was alarmed, and set himself to seek to the 
2CH.20.4	Judah gathered themselves together to seek help from the 
2CH.20.5	Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the 
2CH.20.6	and he said, “
2CH.20.7	Didn’t you, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it to the offspring
2CH.20.8	They lived in it, and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name, saying, 
2CH.20.9	‘If evil comes on us—the sword, judgement, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this house, and before you (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.’ 
2CH.20.10	Now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned away from them, and didn’t destroy them; 
2CH.20.11	behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit. 
2CH.20.12	Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us. We don’t know what to do, but our eyes are on you.”
2CH.20.13	All Judah stood before the 
2CH.20.14	Then the 
2CH.20.15	and he said, “Listen, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, king Jehoshaphat. The 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow, go down against them. Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	You will not need to fight this battle. Set yourselves, stand still, and see the salvation of the 
2CH.20.18	Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the 
2CH.20.19	The Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise the 
2CH.20.20	They rose early in the morning, and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. As they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in the 
2CH.20.21	When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to the 
2CH.20.22	When they began to sing and to praise, the 
2CH.20.23	For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. When they had finished the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy each other.
2CH.20.24	When Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped. 
2CH.20.25	When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their plunder, they found amongst them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. They took plunder for three days, it was so much. 
2CH.20.26	On the fourth day, they assembled themselves in Beracah
2CH.20.27	Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the 
2CH.20.28	They came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments, harps, and trumpets to the 
2CH.20.29	The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that the 
2CH.20.30	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.
2CH.20.31	Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
2CH.20.32	He walked in the way of Asa his father, and didn’t turn away from it, doing that which was right in the 
2CH.20.33	However the high places were not taken away, and the people had still not set their hearts on the God of their fathers. 
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is included in the book of the kings of Israel. 
2CH.20.35	After this, Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. The same did very wickedly. 
2CH.20.36	He joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish. They made the ships in Ezion Geber. 
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, the 
2CH.21.1	Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city, and Jehoram his son reigned in his place. 
2CH.21.2	He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 
2CH.21.3	Their father gave them great gifts of silver, of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn. 
2CH.21.4	Now when Jehoram had risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel. 
2CH.21.5	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.21.6	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did Ahab’s house; for he had Ahab’s daughter as his wife. He did that which was evil in the 
2CH.21.7	However the 
2CH.21.8	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. 
2CH.21.9	Then Jehoram went there with his captains and all his chariots with him. He rose up by night and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, along with the captains of the chariots. 
2CH.21.10	So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken the 
2CH.21.11	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem play the prostitute, and led Judah astray. 
2CH.21.12	A letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, “the 
2CH.21.13	but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute like Ahab’s house did, and also have slain your brothers of your father’s house, who were better than yourself, 
2CH.21.14	behold, the 
2CH.21.15	and you will have great sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.’”
2CH.21.16	The 
2CH.21.17	and they came up against Judah, broke into it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, including his sons and his wives; so that there was no son left him, except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
2CH.21.18	After all this the 
2CH.21.19	In process of time, at the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of severe diseases. His people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. 
2CH.21.20	He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He departed without being missed; and they buried him in David’s city, but not in the tombs of the kings.
2CH.22.1	The inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, because the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the oldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. 
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of Ahab’s house, because his mother was his counsellor in acting wickedly. 
2CH.22.4	He did that which was evil in the 
2CH.22.5	He also followed their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram. 
2CH.22.6	He returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2CH.22.7	Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram; for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the 
2CH.22.8	When Jehu was executing judgement on Ahab’s house, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, serving Ahaziah, and killed them. 
2CH.22.9	He sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and killed him; and they buried him, for they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the 
2CH.22.10	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah. 
2CH.22.11	But Jehoshabeath, the king’s daughter, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stealthily rescued him from amongst the king’s sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she didn’t kill him. 
2CH.22.12	He was with them hidden in God’s house six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.
2CH.23.1	In the seventh year, Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into a covenant with him. 
2CH.23.2	They went around in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers’ households of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.23.3	All the assembly made a covenant with the king in God’s house. He said to them, “Behold, the king’s son must reign, as the 
2CH.23.4	This is the thing that you must do. A third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be gatekeepers of the thresholds. 
2CH.23.5	A third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation. All the people will be in the courts of the 
2CH.23.6	But let no one come into the 
2CH.23.7	The Levites shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand. Whoever comes into the house, let him be slain. Be with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out.”
2CH.23.8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest didn’t dismiss the shift. 
2CH.23.9	Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David’s, which were in God’s house. 
2CH.23.10	He set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, near the altar and the house, around the king. 
2CH.23.11	Then they brought out the king’s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant, and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and they said, “Long live the king!”
2CH.23.12	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the 
2CH.23.13	Then she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king. All the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. The singers also played musical instruments, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, “Treason! treason!”
2CH.23.14	Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t kill her in the 
2CH.23.15	So they made way for her. She went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king’s house; and they killed her there.
2CH.23.16	Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, all the people, and the king, that they should be the 
2CH.23.17	All the people went to the house of Baal, broke it down, broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 
2CH.23.18	Jehoiada appointed the officers of the 
2CH.23.19	He set the gatekeepers at the gates of the 
2CH.23.20	He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the 
2CH.23.21	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. They had slain Athaliah with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah, of Beersheba. 
2CH.24.2	Joash did that which was right in the 
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada took for him two wives, and he became the father of sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	After this, Joash intended to restore the 
2CH.24.5	He gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to year. See that you expedite this matter.” However the Levites didn’t do it right away. 
2CH.24.6	The king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, “Why haven’t you required of the Levites to bring in the tax of Moses the servant of the 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up God’s house; and they also gave all the dedicated things of the 
2CH.24.8	So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the 
2CH.24.9	They made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for the 
2CH.24.10	All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had filled it. 
2CH.24.11	Whenever the chest was brought to the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. 
2CH.24.12	The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the 
2CH.24.13	So the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands. They set up God’s house as it was designed, and strengthened it. 
2CH.24.14	When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, from which were made vessels for the 
2CH.24.15	But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died. He was one hundred and thirty years old when he died. 
2CH.24.16	They buried him in David’s city amongst the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and towards God and his house.
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came, and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them. 
2CH.24.18	They abandoned the house of the 
2CH.24.19	Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to the 
2CH.24.20	The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them, “God says, ‘Why do you disobey the 
2CH.24.21	They conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the 
2CH.24.22	Thus Joash the king didn’t remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. When he died, he said, “May the 
2CH.24.23	At the end of the year, the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from amongst the people, and sent all their plunder to the king of Damascus. 
2CH.24.24	For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and the 
2CH.24.25	When they had departed from him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died. They buried him in David’s city, but they didn’t bury him in the tombs of the kings. 
2CH.24.26	These are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 
2CH.24.27	Now concerning his sons, the greatness of the burdens laid on him, and the rebuilding of God’s house, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	He did that which was right in the 
2CH.25.3	Now when the kingdom was established to him, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king. 
2CH.25.4	But he didn’t put their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as the 
2CH.25.5	Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers’ houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin. He counted them from twenty years old and upward, and found that there were three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go out to war, who could handle spear and shield. 
2CH.25.6	He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for one hundred talents
2CH.25.7	A man of God came to him, saying, “O king, don’t let the army of Israel go with you, for the 
2CH.25.8	But if you will go, take action, and be strong for the battle. God will overthrow you before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to overthrow.”
2CH.25.9	Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do for the hundred talents
2CH.25.9	The man of God answered, “The 
2CH.25.10	Then Amaziah separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again. Therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger. 
2CH.25.11	Amaziah took courage, and led his people out, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir. 
2CH.25.12	The children of Judah carried away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and threw them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces. 
2CH.25.13	But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much plunder.
2CH.25.14	Now after Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burnt incense to them. 
2CH.25.15	Therefore the 
2CH.25.16	As he talked with him, the king said to him, “Have we made you one of the king’s counsellors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?”
2CH.25.16	Then the prophet stopped, and said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel.”
2CH.25.17	Then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come! Let’s look one another in the face.”
2CH.25.18	Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as his wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle. 
2CH.25.19	You say to yourself that you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast. Now stay at home. Why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?’”
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not listen; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom. 
2CH.25.21	So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 
2CH.25.22	Judah was defeated by Israel; so every man fled to his tent.
2CH.25.23	Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2CH.25.24	He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in God’s house with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.25	Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. 
2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren’t they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 
2CH.25.27	Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following the 
2CH.25.28	They brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah.
2CH.26.1	All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah. 
2CH.26.2	He built Eloth and restored it to Judah. After that the king slept with his fathers. 
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	He did that which was right in the 
2CH.26.5	He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God; and as long as he sought the 
2CH.26.6	He went out and fought against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and amongst the Philistines. 
2CH.26.7	God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunim. 
2CH.26.8	The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah. His name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he grew exceedingly strong. 
2CH.26.9	Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them. 
2CH.26.10	He built towers in the wilderness, and dug out many cisterns, for he had much livestock; in the lowland also, and in the plain. He had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields, for he loved farming. 
2CH.26.11	Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, who went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains. 
2CH.26.12	The whole number of the heads of fathers’ households, even the mighty men of valour, was two thousand and six hundred. 
2CH.26.13	Under their hand was an army, three hundred and seven thousand and five hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. 
2CH.26.14	Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging. 
2CH.26.15	In Jerusalem, he made devices, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spread far abroad, because he was marvellously helped until he was strong.
2CH.26.16	But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against the 
2CH.26.17	Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of the 
2CH.26.18	They resisted Uzziah the king, and said to him, “It isn’t for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the 
2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah was angry. He had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the 
2CH.26.20	Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from there. Yes, he himself also hurried to go out, because the 
2CH.26.21	Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the 
2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote. 
2CH.26.23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” Jotham his son reigned in his place.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	He did that which was right in the 
2CH.27.3	He built the upper gate of the 
2CH.27.4	Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers. 
2CH.27.5	He also fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents
2CH.27.6	So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the 
2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He didn’t do that which was right in the 
2CH.28.2	but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also made molten images for the Baals. 
2CH.28.3	Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the 
2CH.28.4	He sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2CH.28.5	Therefore the 
2CH.28.6	For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men, because they had forsaken the 
2CH.28.7	Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king. 
2CH.28.8	The children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much plunder from them, and brought the plunder to Samaria. 
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	Now you intend to degrade the children of Judah and Jerusalem as male and female slaves for yourselves. Aren’t there even with you trespasses of your own against the 
2CH.28.11	Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives that you have taken captive from your brothers, for the fierce wrath of the 
2CH.28.12	Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war, 
2CH.28.13	and said to them, “You must not bring in the captives here, for you intend that which will bring on us a trespass against the 
2CH.28.14	So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the princes and all the assembly. 
2CH.28.15	The men who have been mentioned by name rose up and took the captives, and with the plunder clothed all who were naked amongst them, dressed them, gave them sandals, and gave them something to eat and to drink, anointed them, carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him. 
2CH.28.17	For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and carried away captives. 
2CH.28.18	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and also Gimzo and its villages; and they lived there. 
2CH.28.19	For the 
2CH.28.20	Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and gave him trouble, but didn’t strengthen him. 
2CH.28.21	For Ahaz took away a portion out of the 
2CH.28.22	In the time of his distress, he trespassed yet more against the 
2CH.28.23	For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him. He said, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, so I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. 
2CH.28.24	Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God’s house, and cut the vessels of God’s house in pieces, and shut up the doors of the 
2CH.28.25	In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked the 
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.28.27	Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem, because they didn’t bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	He did that which was right in the 
2CH.29.3	In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the 
2CH.29.4	He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the wide place on the east, 
2CH.29.5	and said to them, “Listen to me, you Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the 
2CH.29.6	For our fathers were unfaithful, and have done that which was evil in the 
2CH.29.7	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burnt incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	Therefore the 
2CH.29.9	For, behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 
2CH.29.10	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the 
2CH.29.11	My sons, don’t be negligent now; for the 
2CH.29.12	Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah; 
2CH.29.13	and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; 
2CH.29.14	and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. 
2CH.29.15	They gathered their brothers, sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the 
2CH.29.16	The priests went into the inner part of the 
2CH.29.17	Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, “We have cleansed all the 
2CH.29.19	Moreover, we have prepared and sanctified all the vessels which king Ahaz threw away in his reign, when he was unfaithful. Behold, they are before the 
2CH.29.20	Then Hezekiah the king arose early, gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the 
2CH.29.21	They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. He commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the 
2CH.29.22	So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar. They killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 
2CH.29.23	They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them. 
2CH.29.24	Then the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
2CH.29.25	He set the Levites in the 
2CH.29.26	The Levites stood with David’s instruments, and the priests with the trumpets. 
2CH.29.27	Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the 
2CH.29.28	All the assembly worshipped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
2CH.29.29	When they had finished offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped. 
2CH.29.30	Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to the 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah answered, “Now you have consecrated yourselves to the 
2CH.29.32	The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs. All these were for a burnt offering to the 
2CH.29.33	The consecrated things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep. 
2CH.29.34	But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings. Therefore their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. 
2CH.29.35	Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the 
2CH.29.36	Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced, because of that which God had prepared for the people; for the thing was done suddenly.
2CH.30.1	Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the 
2CH.30.2	For the king had taken counsel with his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem to keep the Passover in the second month. 
2CH.30.3	For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, and the people had not gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.4	The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly. 
2CH.30.5	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to the 
2CH.30.6	So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, “You children of Israel, turn again to the 
2CH.30.7	Don’t be like your fathers and like your brothers, who trespassed against the 
2CH.30.8	Now don’t be stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the 
2CH.30.9	For if you turn again to the 
2CH.30.10	So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun, but people ridiculed them and mocked them. 
2CH.30.11	Nevertheless some men of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	Also the hand of God came on Judah to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the 
2CH.30.13	Many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly. 
2CH.30.14	They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away all the altars for incense and threw them into the brook Kidron. 
2CH.30.15	Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the 
2CH.30.16	They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites. 
2CH.30.17	For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to the 
2CH.30.18	For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover other than the way it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “May the good the 
2CH.30.19	who sets his heart to seek God, the 
2CH.30.20	The 
2CH.30.21	The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness. The Levites and the priests praised the 
2CH.30.22	Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of the 
2CH.30.23	The whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days, and they kept another seven days with gladness. 
2CH.30.24	For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. 
2CH.30.25	All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced. 
2CH.30.26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was nothing like this in Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.27	Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people. Their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.
2CH.31.1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, also in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
2CH.31.2	Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the 
2CH.31.3	He also appointed the king’s portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the 
2CH.31.4	Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the 
2CH.31.5	As soon as the commandment went out, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and of all the increase of the field; and they brought in the tithe of all things abundantly. 
2CH.31.6	The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to the 
2CH.31.7	In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. 
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the 
2CH.31.9	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps. 
2CH.31.10	Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, “Since people began to bring the offerings into the 
2CH.31.11	Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the 
2CH.31.12	They brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated things faithfully. Conaniah the Levite was ruler over them, and Shimei his brother was second. 
2CH.31.13	Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of God’s house. 
2CH.31.14	Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east gate, was over the free will offerings of God, to distribute the 
2CH.31.15	Under him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, to the great as well as to the small; 
2CH.31.16	in addition to those who were listed by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into the 
2CH.31.17	and those who were listed by genealogy of the priests by their fathers’ houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions; 
2CH.31.18	and those who were listed by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation; for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness. 
2CH.31.19	Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the pasture lands of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males amongst the priests, and to all who were listed by genealogy amongst the Levites.
2CH.31.20	Hezekiah did so throughout all Judah; and he did that which was good, right, and faithful before the 
2CH.31.21	In every work that he began in the service of God’s house, in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
2CH.32.1	After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and intended to win them for himself. 
2CH.32.2	When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he was planning to fight against Jerusalem, 
2CH.32.3	he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city, and they helped him. 
2CH.32.4	So, many people gathered together and they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the middle of the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find abundant water?”
2CH.32.5	He took courage, built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, with the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in David’s city, and made weapons and shields in abundance. 
2CH.32.6	He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the wide place at the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying, 
2CH.32.7	“Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or dismayed because of the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with him; for there is a greater one with us than with him. 
2CH.32.8	An arm of flesh is with him, but the 
2CH.32.9	After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying, 
2CH.32.10	Sennacherib king of Assyria says, “In whom do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem? 
2CH.32.11	Doesn’t Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, ‘The 
2CH.32.12	Hasn’t the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You shall worship before one altar, and you shall burn incense on it?’ 
2CH.32.13	Don’t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand? 
2CH.32.14	Who was there amongst all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand? 
2CH.32.15	Now therefore don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this way. Don’t believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand?”
2CH.32.16	His servants spoke yet more against the 
2CH.32.17	He also wrote letters insulting the 
2CH.32.18	They called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. 
2CH.32.19	They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands.
2CH.32.20	Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.
2CH.32.21	The 
2CH.32.22	Thus the 
2CH.32.23	Many brought gifts to the 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah was terminally ill, and he prayed to the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah didn’t reciprocate appropriate to the benefit done for him, because his heart was lifted up. Therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.32.26	Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the 
2CH.32.27	Hezekiah had exceedingly much riches and honour. He provided himself with treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of valuable vessels; 
2CH.32.28	also storehouses for the increase of grain, new wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of animals, and flocks in folds. 
2CH.32.29	Moreover he provided for himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him abundant possessions. 
2CH.32.30	This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of David’s city. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
2CH.32.31	However concerning the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.32.33	Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honoured him at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.2	He did that which was evil in the 
2CH.33.3	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he raised up altars for the Baals, made Asheroth, and worshipped all the army of the sky, and served them. 
2CH.33.4	He built altars in the 
2CH.33.5	He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the 
2CH.33.6	He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom. He practised sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits and with wizards. He did much evil in the 
2CH.33.7	He set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made, in God’s house, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever. 
2CH.33.8	I will not any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law, the statutes, and the ordinances given by Moses.” 
2CH.33.9	Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil than did the nations whom the 
2CH.33.10	The 
2CH.33.11	Therefore the 
2CH.33.12	When he was in distress, he begged the 
2CH.33.13	He prayed to him; and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the 
2CH.33.14	Now after this, he built an outer wall to David’s city, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate. He encircled Ophel with it, and raised it up to a very great height; and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah. 
2CH.33.15	He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the 
2CH.33.16	He built up the 
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only to the 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the 
2CH.33.19	His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherah poles and the engraved images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.
2CH.33.20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his place.
2CH.33.21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.22	He did that which was evil in the 
2CH.33.23	He didn’t humble himself before the 
2CH.33.24	His servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house. 
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.2	He did that which was right in the 
2CH.34.3	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, the Asherah poles, the engraved images, and the molten images. 
2CH.34.4	They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and he cut down the incense altars that were on high above them. He broke the Asherah poles, the engraved images, and the molten images in pieces, made dust of them, and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. 
2CH.34.5	He burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.6	He did this in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins. 
2CH.34.7	He broke down the altars, and beat the Asherah poles and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, then returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the 
2CH.34.9	They came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into God’s house, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered from the hands of Manasseh, Ephraim, of all the remnant of Israel, of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.10	They delivered it into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the 
2CH.34.11	They gave it to the carpenters and to the builders, to buy cut stone and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. 
2CH.34.12	The men did the work faithfully. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to give direction; and others of the Levites, who were all skilful with musical instruments. 
2CH.34.13	Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and directed all who did the work in every kind of service. Of the Levites, there were scribes, officials, and gatekeepers.
2CH.34.14	When they brought out the money that was brought into the 
2CH.34.15	Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in the 
2CH.34.16	Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, “All that was committed to your servants, they are doing. 
2CH.34.17	They have emptied out the money that was found in the 
2CH.34.18	Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book.” Shaphan read from it to the king.
2CH.34.19	When the king had heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes. 
2CH.34.20	The king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying, 
2CH.34.21	“Go enquire of the 
2CH.34.22	So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect.
2CH.34.23	She said to them, “The 
2CH.34.24	“The 
2CH.34.25	Because they have forsaken me, and have burnt incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath is poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.’”’ 
2CH.34.26	But to the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the 
2CH.34.27	because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me, I also have heard you,” says the 
2CH.34.28	“Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes won’t see all the evil that I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.”’”
2CH.34.28	They brought back word to the king.
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	The king went up to the 
2CH.34.31	The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the 
2CH.34.32	He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. 
2CH.34.33	Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve the 
2CH.35.1	Josiah kept a Passover to the 
2CH.35.2	He set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them in the service of the 
2CH.35.3	He said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to the 
2CH.35.4	Prepare yourselves after your fathers’ houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son. 
2CH.35.5	Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brothers the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a fathers’ house of the Levites. 
2CH.35.6	Kill the Passover, sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the 
2CH.35.7	Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and young goats, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls. These were of the king’s substance. 
2CH.35.8	His princes gave a free will offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the rulers of God’s house, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small livestock, and three hundred head of cattle. 
2CH.35.9	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock and five hundred head of cattle.
2CH.35.10	So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king’s commandment. 
2CH.35.11	They killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the Levites skinned them. 
2CH.35.12	They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer to the 
2CH.35.13	They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance. They boiled the holy offerings in pots, in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people. 
2CH.35.14	Afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night. Therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron. 
2CH.35.15	The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the gatekeepers were at every gate. They didn’t need to depart from their service, because their brothers the Levites prepared for them.
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the 
2CH.35.17	The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 
2CH.35.18	There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, nor did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests, the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	This Passover was kept in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah.
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him. 
2CH.35.21	But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you today, but against the house with which I have war. God has commanded me to make haste. Beware that it is God who is with me, that he not destroy you.”
2CH.35.22	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and didn’t listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. 
2CH.35.23	The archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, because I am seriously wounded!”
2CH.35.24	So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 
2CH.35.25	Jeremiah lamented for Josiah, and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel. Behold, they are written in the lamentations. 
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the 
2CH.35.27	and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.1	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s place in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.2	Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.3	The king of Egypt removed him from office at Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent
2CH.36.4	The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in the 
2CH.36.6	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also carried some of the vessels of the 
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in the 
2CH.36.10	At the return of the year, king Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the valuable vessels of the 
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.36.12	He did that which was evil in the 
2CH.36.13	He also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to the 
2CH.36.14	Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the 
2CH.36.15	The 
2CH.36.16	but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the 
2CH.36.17	Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or grey-headed. He gave them all into his hand. 
2CH.36.18	All the vessels of God’s house, great and small, and the treasures of the 
2CH.36.19	They burnt God’s house, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all of its valuable vessels. 
2CH.36.20	He carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon, and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia, 
2CH.36.21	to fulfil the 
2CH.36.22	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the 
2CH.36.23	“Cyrus king of Persia says, ‘The 
EZR.1.1	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the 
EZR.1.2	“Cyrus king of Persia says, ‘The 
EZR.1.3	Whoever there is amongst you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the 
EZR.1.4	Whoever is left, in any place where he lives, let the men of his place help him with silver, with gold, with goods, and with animals, in addition to the free will offering for God’s house which is in Jerusalem.’”
EZR.1.5	Then the heads of fathers’ households of Judah and Benjamin, the priests, and the Levites, all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the 
EZR.1.6	All those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with animals, and with precious things, in addition to all that was willingly offered. 
EZR.1.7	Also Cyrus the king brought out the vessels of the 
EZR.1.8	even those, Cyrus king of Persia brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. 
EZR.1.9	This is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, one thousand platters of silver, twenty-nine knives, 
EZR.1.10	thirty bowls of gold, four hundred and ten silver bowls of a second sort, and one thousand other vessels. 
EZR.1.11	All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. Sheshbazzar brought all these up when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
EZR.2.1	Now these are the children of the province, who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his city;

EZR.2.62	These sought their place amongst those who were registered by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore they were deemed disqualified and removed from the priesthood. 
EZR.2.63	The governor told them that they should not eat of the most holy things until a priest stood up to serve with Urim and with Thummim.
EZR.2.64	The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand and three hundred and sixty,

EZR.2.70	So the priests and the Levites, with some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants, lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
EZR.3.1	When the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. 
EZR.3.2	Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak stood up with his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. 
EZR.3.3	In spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands, they set the altar on its base; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the 
EZR.3.4	They kept the feast of booths, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required; 
EZR.3.5	and afterward the continual burnt offering, the offerings of the new moons, of all the set feasts of the 
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month, they began to offer burnt offerings to the 
EZR.3.7	They also gave money to the masons, and to the carpenters. They also gave food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from Cyrus King of Persia.
EZR.3.8	Now in the second year of their coming to God’s house at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the 
EZR.3.9	Then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in God’s house: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites. 
EZR.3.10	When the builders laid the foundation of the 
EZR.3.11	They sang to one another in praising and giving thanks to the 
EZR.3.12	But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ households, the old men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice. Many also shouted aloud for joy, 
EZR.3.13	so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard far away.
EZR.4.1	Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to the 
EZR.4.2	they came near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’ households, and said to them, “Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as you do; and we have been sacrificing to him since the days of Esar Haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.”
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ households of Israel, said to them, “You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the 
EZR.4.4	Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building. 
EZR.4.5	They hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
EZR.4.6	In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.4.7	In the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian, and delivered in the Syrian language. 
EZR.4.8	Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows; 
EZR.4.9	then Rehum the chancellor, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites, 
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth, wrote.
EZR.4.11	This is the copy of the letter that they sent:
EZR.4.11	To King Artaxerxes,
EZR.4.11	From your servants the men beyond the River.
EZR.4.12	Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem. They are building the rebellious and bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations. 
EZR.4.13	Be it known now to the king that if this city is built and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings. 
EZR.4.14	Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not appropriate for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore we have sent and informed the king, 
EZR.4.15	that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will see in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have started rebellions within it in the past. That is why this city was destroyed. 
EZR.4.16	We inform the king that if this city is built and the walls finished, then you will have no possession beyond the River.
EZR.4.17	Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions who live in Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River:
EZR.4.17	Peace.
EZR.4.18	The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me. 
EZR.4.19	I decreed, and search has been made, and it was found that this city has made insurrection against kings in the past, and that rebellion and revolts have been made in it. 
EZR.4.20	There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid to them. 
EZR.4.21	Make a decree now to cause these men to cease, and that this city not be built, until a decree is made by me. 
EZR.4.22	Be careful that you not be slack doing so. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
EZR.4.23	Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force of arms. 
EZR.4.24	Then work stopped on God’s house which is at Jerusalem. It stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
EZR.5.1	Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem. They prophesied to them in the name of the God of Israel. 
EZR.5.2	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build God’s house which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them. 
EZR.5.3	At the same time Tattenai, the governor beyond the River came to them, with Shetharbozenai, and their companions, and asked them, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?” 
EZR.5.4	They also asked for the names of the men were who were making this building. 
EZR.5.5	But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they didn’t make them cease, until the matter should come to Darius, and an answer should be returned by letter concerning it.
EZR.5.6	The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shetharbozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king follows. 
EZR.5.7	They sent a letter to him, in which was written:
EZR.5.7	To Darius the king, all peace.
EZR.5.8	Be it known to the king that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls. This work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands. 
EZR.5.9	Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?” 
EZR.5.10	We asked them their names also, to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head. 
EZR.5.11	Thus they returned us answer, saying, “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished. 
EZR.5.12	But after our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. 
EZR.5.13	But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God. 
EZR.5.14	The gold and silver vessels of God’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those Cyrus the king also took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor. 
EZR.5.15	He said to him, ‘Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let God’s house be built in its place.’ 
EZR.5.16	Then the same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of God’s house which is in Jerusalem. Since that time even until now it has been being built, and yet it is not completed.
EZR.5.17	Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the king’s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.”
EZR.6.1	Then Darius the king made a decree, and the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon, was searched. 
EZR.6.2	A scroll was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, and in it this was written for a record:
EZR.6.3	In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning God’s house at Jerusalem, let the house be built, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be strongly laid; with its height sixty cubits,
EZR.6.4	with three courses of great stones and a course of new timber. Let the expenses be given out of the king’s house. 
EZR.6.5	Also let the gold and silver vessels of God’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, everything to its place. You shall put them in God’s house.
EZR.6.6	Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, you must stay far from there. 
EZR.6.7	Leave the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place. 
EZR.6.8	Moreover I make a decree what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses must be given with all diligence to these men, that they not be hindered. 
EZR.6.9	That which they have need of, including young bulls, rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail; 
EZR.6.10	that they may offer sacrifices of pleasant aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. 
EZR.6.11	I have also made a decree that whoever alters this message, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened on it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. 
EZR.6.12	May the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who stretch out their hand to alter this, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree. Let it be done with all diligence.
EZR.6.13	Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and their companions did accordingly with all diligence, because Darius the king had sent a decree.
EZR.6.14	The elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 
EZR.6.15	This house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
EZR.6.16	The children of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy. 
EZR.6.17	They offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
EZR.6.18	They set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	The children of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. 
EZR.6.20	Because the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together, all of them were pure. They killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves. 
EZR.6.21	The children of Israel who had returned out of the captivity, and all who had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek the 
EZR.6.22	and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; because the 
EZR.7.1	Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 
EZR.7.2	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest— 
EZR.7.6	this Ezra went up from Babylon. He was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which the 
EZR.7.7	Some of the children of Israel, including some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. 
EZR.7.8	He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 
EZR.7.9	For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him. 
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had set his heart to seek the 
EZR.7.11	Now this is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the 
EZR.7.12	Artaxerxes, king of kings,
EZR.7.12	To Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the perfect God of heaven.
EZR.7.12	Now 
EZR.7.13	I make a decree, that all those of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, who intend of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with you. 
EZR.7.14	Because you are sent by the king and his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand, 
EZR.7.15	and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, 
EZR.7.16	and all the silver and gold that you will find in all the province of Babylon, with the free will offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem; 
EZR.7.17	therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls, rams, lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.18	Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do that according to the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	The vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.20	Whatever more will be needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to give, give it out of the king’s treasure house.
EZR.7.21	I, even I Artaxerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it shall be done with all diligence, 
EZR.7.22	up to one hundred talents
EZR.7.23	Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
EZR.7.24	Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or labourers of this house of God.
EZR.7.25	You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people who are beyond the River, who all know the laws of your God; and teach him who doesn’t know them. 
EZR.7.26	Whoever will not do the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgement be executed on him with all diligence, whether it is to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
EZR.7.27	Blessed be the 
EZR.7.28	and has extended loving kindness to me before the king and his counsellors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. I was strengthened according to the 
EZR.8.1	Now these are the heads of their fathers’ households, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:
EZR.8.2	Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom.
EZR.8.2	Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel.
EZR.8.2	Of the sons of David, Hattush.
EZR.8.3	Of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were listed by genealogy of the males one hundred and fifty.
EZR.8.4	Of the sons of Pahathmoab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males.
EZR.8.5	Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males.
EZR.8.6	Of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males.
EZR.8.7	Of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males.
EZR.8.8	Of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him eighty males.
EZR.8.9	Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
EZR.8.10	Of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him one hundred and sixty males.
EZR.8.11	Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty-eight males.
EZR.8.12	Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him one hundred and ten males.
EZR.8.13	Of the sons of Adonikam, who were the last; and these are their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah; and with them sixty males.
EZR.8.14	Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males.
EZR.8.15	I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I looked around at the people and the priests, and found there were none of the sons of Levi. 
EZR.8.16	Then I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, for Elnathan, for Jarib, for Elnathan, for Nathan, for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib and for Elnathan, who were teachers. 
EZR.8.17	I sent them out to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should tell Iddo, and his brothers the temple servants, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God. 
EZR.8.18	According to the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen; 
EZR.8.19	and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty; 
EZR.8.20	and of the temple servants, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty temple servants. All of them were mentioned by name.
EZR.8.21	Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our possessions. 
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, “The hand of our God is on all those who seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all those who forsake him.” 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and begged our God for this: and he granted our request.
EZR.8.24	Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them, 
EZR.8.25	and weighed to them the silver, the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, his counsellors, his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered. 
EZR.8.26	I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver,
EZR.8.27	twenty bowls of gold weighing one thousand darics;
EZR.8.28	I said to them, “You are holy to the 
EZR.8.29	Watch and keep them, until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’ households of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the rooms of the 
EZR.8.30	So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God. 
EZR.8.31	Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the bandit by the way. 
EZR.8.32	We came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days. 
EZR.8.33	On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite; 
EZR.8.34	everything by number and by weight; and all the weight was written at that time.
EZR.8.35	The children of the captivity, who had come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the 
EZR.8.36	They delivered the king’s commissions to the king’s local governors, and to the governors beyond the River. So they supported the people and God’s house.
EZR.9.1	Now when these things were done, the princes came near to me, saying, “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, following their abominations, even those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 
EZR.9.2	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy offspring have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands. Yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.”
EZR.9.3	When I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled the hair out of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded. 
EZR.9.4	Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel were assembled to me, because of their trespass of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening offering.
EZR.9.5	At the evening offering I rose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn; and I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to the 
EZR.9.6	and I said, “My God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God; for our iniquities have increased over our head, and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens. 
EZR.9.7	Since the days of our fathers we have been exceedingly guilty to this day; and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests, have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. 
EZR.9.8	Now for a little moment grace has been shown from the 
EZR.9.9	For we are bondservants; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended loving kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to set up the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	“Now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments, 
EZR.9.11	which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness. 
EZR.9.12	Now therefore don’t give your daughters to their sons. Don’t take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever; that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.’
EZR.9.13	“After all that has come on us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, since you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a remnant, 
EZR.9.14	shall we again break your commandments, and join ourselves with the peoples that do these abominations? Wouldn’t you be angry with us until you had consumed us, so that there would be no remnant, nor any to escape? 
EZR.9.15	, the God of Israel, you are righteous; for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is today. Behold,
EZR.10.1	Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before God’s house, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very bitterly. 
EZR.10.2	Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered Ezra, “We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land. Yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing. 
EZR.10.3	Now therefore let’s make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and those who are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let it be done according to the law. 
EZR.10.4	Arise; for the matter belongs to you, and we are with you. Be courageous, and do it.”
EZR.10.5	Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore. 
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra rose up from before God’s house, and went into the room of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. When he came there, he ate no bread, nor drank water; for he mourned because of the trespass of those of the captivity. 
EZR.10.7	They made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem; 
EZR.10.8	and that whoever didn’t come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his possessions should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.
EZR.10.9	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the wide place in front of God’s house, trembling because of this matter, and because of the great rain.
EZR.10.10	Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel. 
EZR.10.11	Now therefore make confession to the 
EZR.10.12	Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, “We must do as you have said concerning us. 
EZR.10.13	But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside. This is not a work of one day or two, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter. 
EZR.10.14	Now let our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God is turned from us, until this matter is resolved.”
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
EZR.10.16	The children of the captivity did so. Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers’ households, after their fathers’ houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. 
EZR.10.17	They finished with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
EZR.10.18	Amongst the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women:
EZR.10.18	of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.

EZR.10.39	and Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah, 
EZR.10.40	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 
EZR.10.41	Azarel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah, Joseph.
EZR.10.43	Of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Iddo, and Joel, Benaiah.
EZR.10.44	All these had taken foreign wives; and some of them had wives by whom they had children.
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.
NEH.1.1	Now in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the palace, 
NEH.1.2	Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them about the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 
NEH.1.3	They said to me, “The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down, and its gates are burnt with fire.”
NEH.1.4	When I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned several days; and I fasted and prayed before the God
NEH.1.5	and said, “I beg you, 
NEH.1.6	Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father’s house have sinned. 
NEH.1.7	We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses.
NEH.1.8	“Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you trespass, I will scatter you amongst the peoples; 
NEH.1.9	but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.’
NEH.1.10	“Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand. 
NEH.1.11	Lord,
NEH.1.11	Now I was cup bearer to the king.
NEH.2.1	In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, I picked up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad before in his presence. 
NEH.2.2	The king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart.”
NEH.2.2	Then I was very much afraid. 
NEH.2.3	I said to the king, “Let the king live forever! Why shouldn’t my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?”
NEH.2.4	Then the king said to me, “What is your request?”
NEH.2.4	So I prayed to the God of heaven. 
NEH.2.5	I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favour in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may build it.”
NEH.2.6	The king said to me (the queen was also sitting by him), “How long will your journey be? When will you return?”
NEH.2.6	So it pleased the king to send me, and I set a time for him. 
NEH.2.7	Moreover I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah; 
NEH.2.8	and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house that I will occupy.”
NEH.2.8	The king granted my requests, because of the good hand of my God on me. 
NEH.2.9	Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. 
NEH.2.10	When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. 
NEH.2.11	So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. 
NEH.2.12	I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There wasn’t any animal with me, except the animal that I rode on. 
NEH.2.13	I went out by night by the valley gate, even towards the jackal’s well, then to the dung gate, and inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire. 
NEH.2.14	Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king’s pool, but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass. 
NEH.2.15	Then I went up in the night by the brook, and inspected the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned. 
NEH.2.16	The rulers didn’t know where I went, or what I did. I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work.
NEH.2.17	Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burnt with fire. Come, let’s build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we won’t be disgraced.” 
NEH.2.18	I told them about the hand of my God which was good on me, and also about the king’s words that he had spoken to me.
NEH.2.18	They said, “Let’s rise up and build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work.
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us, and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”
NEH.2.20	Then I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, his servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.”
NEH.3.1	Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate. They sanctified it, and set up its doors. They sanctified it even to the tower of Hammeah, to the tower of Hananel. 
NEH.3.2	Next to him the men of Jericho built. Next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.
NEH.3.3	The sons of Hassenaah built the fish gate. They laid its beams, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.4	Next to them, Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz made repairs. Next to them, Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel made repairs. Next to them, Zadok the son of Baana made repairs. 
NEH.3.5	Next to them, the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles didn’t put their necks to the Lord’s work.
NEH.3.6	Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the old gate. They laid its beams, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its bars. 
NEH.3.7	Next to them, Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, repaired the residence of the governor beyond the River. 
NEH.3.8	Next to him, Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths, made repairs. Next to him, Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs, and they fortified Jerusalem even to the wide wall. 
NEH.3.9	Next to them, Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs. 
NEH.3.10	Next to them, Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs across from his house. Next to him, Hattush the son of Hashabneiah made repairs. 
NEH.3.11	Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired another portion, and the tower of the furnaces. 
NEH.3.12	Next to him, Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, he and his daughters, made repairs.
NEH.3.13	Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the valley gate. They built it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and one thousand cubits
NEH.3.14	Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth Haccherem repaired the dung gate. He built it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars.
NEH.3.15	Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah repaired the spring gate. He built it, and covered it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king’s garden, even to the stairs that go down from David’s city. 
NEH.3.16	After him, Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth Zur, made repairs to the place opposite the tombs of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the house of the mighty men. 
NEH.3.17	After him, the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani made repairs. Next to him, Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, made repairs for his district. 
NEH.3.18	After him, their brothers, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of Keilah made repairs. 
NEH.3.19	Next to him, Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, repaired another portion, across from the ascent to the armoury at the turning of the wall. 
NEH.3.20	After him, Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion, from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 
NEH.3.21	After him, Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib. 
NEH.3.22	After him, the priests, the men of the Plain made repairs. 
NEH.3.23	After them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs across from their house. After them, Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah made repairs beside his own house. 
NEH.3.24	After him, Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another portion, from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall, and to the corner. 
NEH.3.25	Palal the son of Uzai made repairs opposite the turning of the wall, and the tower that stands out from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs. 
NEH.3.26	(Now the temple servants lived in Ophel, to the place opposite the water gate towards the east, and the tower that stands out.) 
NEH.3.27	After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, opposite the great tower that stands out, and to the wall of Ophel.
NEH.3.28	Above the horse gate, the priests made repairs, everyone across from his own house. 
NEH.3.29	After them, Zadok the son of Immer made repairs across from his own house. After him, Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate made repairs. 
NEH.3.30	After him, Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another portion. After him, Meshullam the son of Berechiah made repairs across from his room. 
NEH.3.31	After him, Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths to the house of the temple servants, and of the merchants, made repairs opposite the gate of Hammiphkad, and to the ascent of the corner. 
NEH.3.32	Between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs.
NEH.4.1	But when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and was very indignant, and mocked the Jews. 
NEH.4.2	He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, since they are burnt?”
NEH.4.3	Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, “What they are building, if a fox climbed up it, he would break down their stone wall.”
NEH.4.4	“Hear, our God; for we are despised. Turn back their reproach on their own head. Give them up for a plunder in a land of captivity. 
NEH.4.5	Don’t cover their iniquity. Don’t let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they have insulted the builders.”
NEH.4.6	So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height: for the people had a mind to work.
NEH.4.7	But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be filled, they were very angry; 
NEH.4.8	and they all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion amongst us. 
NEH.4.9	But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night because of them. 
NEH.4.10	Judah said, “The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading, and there is much rubble; so that we are not able to build the wall.” 
NEH.4.11	Our adversaries said, “They will not know or see, until we come in amongst them and kill them, and cause the work to cease.”
NEH.4.12	When the Jews who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”
NEH.4.13	Therefore I set guards in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places. I set the people by family groups with their swords, their spears, and their bows. 
NEH.4.14	I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them! Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”
NEH.4.15	When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work. 
NEH.4.16	From that time forth, half of my servants did the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. 
NEH.4.17	Those who built the wall, and those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands did the work, and with the other held his weapon. 
NEH.4.18	Amongst the builders, everyone wore his sword at his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was by me. 
NEH.4.19	I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another. 
NEH.4.20	Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally there to us. Our God will fight for us.”
NEH.4.21	So we did the work. Half of the people held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared. 
NEH.4.22	Likewise at the same time I said to the people, “Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day.” 
NEH.4.23	So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes. Everyone took his weapon to the water.
NEH.5.1	Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews. 
NEH.5.2	For there were some who said, “We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain, that we may eat and live.” 
NEH.5.3	There were also some who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain, because of the famine.” 
NEH.5.4	There were also some who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral. 
NEH.5.5	Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children. Behold,
NEH.5.6	I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. 
NEH.5.7	Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, “You exact usury, everyone of his brother.” I held a great assembly against them. 
NEH.5.8	I said to them, “We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us?” Then they held their peace, and found not a word to say. 
NEH.5.9	Also I said, “The thing that you do is not good. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies? 
NEH.5.10	I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. Please let us stop this usury. 
NEH.5.11	Please restore to them, even today, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them.”
NEH.5.12	Then they said, “We will restore them, and will require nothing of them. We will do so, even as you say.”
NEH.5.12	Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise. 
NEH.5.13	Also I shook out my lap, and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that doesn’t perform this promise; even may he be shaken out and emptied like this.”
NEH.5.13	All the assembly said, “Amen,” and praised the 
NEH.5.14	Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor. 
NEH.5.15	But the former governors who were before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine from them, plus forty shekels
NEH.5.16	Yes, I also continued in the work of this wall. We didn’t buy any land. All my servants were gathered there to the work. 
NEH.5.17	Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred and fifty men, in addition to those who came to us from amongst the nations that were around us. 
NEH.5.18	Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine. Yet for all this, I didn’t demand the governor’s pay, because the bondage was heavy on this people. 
NEH.5.19	Remember me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.
NEH.6.1	Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates) 
NEH.6.2	Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come! Let’s meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to harm me.
NEH.6.3	I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that I can’t come down. Why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?” 
NEH.6.4	They sent to me four times like this; and I answered them the same way. 
NEH.6.5	Then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand, 
NEH.6.6	in which was written, “It is reported amongst the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel. Because of that, you are building the wall. You would be their king, according to these words. 
NEH.6.7	You have also appointed prophets to proclaim of you at Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let’s take counsel together.”
NEH.6.8	Then I sent to him, saying, “There are no such things done as you say, but you imagine them out of your own heart.” 
NEH.6.9	For they all would have made us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it not be done.” But now, strengthen my hands.
NEH.6.10	I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home; and he said, “Let us meet together in God’s house, within the temple, and let’s shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to kill you. Yes, in the night they will come to kill you.”
NEH.6.11	I said, “Should a man like me flee? Who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.” 
NEH.6.12	I discerned, and behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
NEH.6.13	He was hired so that I would be afraid, do so, and sin, and that they might have material for an evil report, that they might reproach me. 
NEH.6.14	“Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.”
NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days. 
NEH.6.16	When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations that were around us were afraid, and they lost their confidence; for they perceived that this work was done by our God. 
NEH.6.17	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them. 
NEH.6.18	For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife. 
NEH.6.19	Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
NEH.7.1	Now when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed, 
NEH.7.2	I put my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. 
NEH.7.3	I said to them, “Don’t let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut the doors, and you bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, with everyone near his house.”
NEH.7.4	Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.
NEH.7.5	My God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be listed by genealogy. I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found this written in it:
NEH.7.6	These are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, everyone to his city, 
NEH.7.7	who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.
NEH.7.7	The number of the men of the people of Israel:
NEH.7.8	The children of Parosh: two thousand and one hundred and seventy-two.
NEH.7.9	The children of Shephatiah: three hundred and seventy-two.
NEH.7.10	The children of Arah: six hundred and fifty-two.

NEH.7.19	The children of Bigvai: two thousand and sixty-seven.
NEH.7.20	The children of Adin: six hundred and fifty-five.
NEH.7.21	The children of Ater: of Hezekiah, ninety-eight.
NEH.7.22	The children of Hashum: three hundred and twenty-eight.
NEH.7.23	The children of Bezai: three hundred and twenty-four.
NEH.7.24	The children of Hariph: one hundred and twelve.
NEH.7.25	The children of Gibeon: ninety-five.
NEH.7.26	The men of Bethlehem and Netophah: one hundred and eighty-eight.
NEH.7.27	The men of Anathoth: one hundred and twenty-eight.
NEH.7.28	The men of Beth Azmaveth: forty-two.
NEH.7.29	The men of Kiriath Jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth: seven hundred and forty-three.
NEH.7.30	The men of Ramah and Geba: six hundred and twenty-one.
NEH.7.31	The men of Michmas: one hundred and twenty-two.
NEH.7.32	The men of Bethel and Ai: one hundred and twenty-three.
NEH.7.33	The men of the other Nebo: fifty-two.

NEH.7.51	the children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, 
NEH.7.52	the children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephushesim, 
NEH.7.53	the children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur,

NEH.7.55	the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah,

NEH.7.57	The children of Solomon’s servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida, 
NEH.7.58	the children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel, 
NEH.7.59	the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim, and the children of Amon. 
NEH.7.60	All the temple servants and the children of Solomon’s servants were three hundred and ninety-two.
NEH.7.61	These were those who went up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show their fathers’ houses, nor their offspring,
NEH.7.62	The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda: six hundred and forty-two.
NEH.7.63	Of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
NEH.7.64	These searched for their genealogical records, but couldn’t find them. Therefore they were deemed disqualified and removed from the priesthood. 
NEH.7.65	The governor told them not to eat of the most holy things until a priest stood up to minister with Urim and Thummim.
NEH.7.66	The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand and three hundred and sixty, 
NEH.7.67	in addition to their male servants and their female servants, of whom there were seven thousand and three hundred and thirty-seven. They had two hundred and forty-five singing men and singing women. 
NEH.7.68	Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six; their mules, two hundred and forty-five; 
NEH.7.69	their camels, four hundred and thirty-five; their donkeys, six thousand and seven hundred and twenty.
NEH.7.70	Some from amongst the heads of fathers’ households gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold,
NEH.7.71	Some of the heads of fathers’ households gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred minas
NEH.7.72	That which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, plus two thousand minas of silver, and sixty-seven priests’ garments.
NEH.7.73	So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel, lived in their cities.
NEH.7.73	When the seventh month had come, the children of Israel were in their cities.
NEH.8.1	All the people gathered themselves together as one man into the wide place that was in front of the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the 
NEH.8.2	Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month. 
NEH.8.3	He read from it before the wide place that was in front of the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those who could understand. The ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. 
NEH.8.4	Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. 
NEH.8.5	Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people), and when he opened it, all the people stood up. 
NEH.8.6	Then Ezra blessed the 
NEH.8.6	All the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” with the lifting up of their hands. They bowed their heads, and worshipped the 
NEH.8.7	Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law; and the people stayed in their place. 
NEH.8.8	They read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.
NEH.8.9	Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, “Today is holy to the 
NEH.8.10	Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared, for today is holy to our Lord. Don’t be grieved, for the joy of the 
NEH.8.11	So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Hold your peace, for the day is holy. Don’t be grieved.”
NEH.8.12	All the people went their way to eat, to drink, to send portions, and to celebrate, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.
NEH.8.13	On the second day, the heads of fathers’ households of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered together to Ezra the scribe, to study the words of the law. 
NEH.8.14	They found written in the law how the 
NEH.8.15	and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and get olive branches, branches of wild olive, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make temporary shelters,
NEH.8.16	So the people went out, and brought them, and made themselves temporary shelters,
NEH.8.17	All the assembly of those who had come back out of the captivity made temporary shelters,
NEH.8.18	Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. They kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.
NEH.9.1	Now in the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, with sackcloth, and dirt on them. 
NEH.9.2	The offspring of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. 
NEH.9.3	They stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the 
NEH.9.4	Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani of the Levites stood up on the stairs, and cried with a loud voice to the 
NEH.9.5	Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless the 
NEH.9.6	You are the 
NEH.9.7	You are the 
NEH.9.8	found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his offspring, and have performed your words; for you are righteous.
NEH.9.9	“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea, 
NEH.9.10	and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and made a name for yourself, as it is today. 
NEH.9.11	You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the middle of the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters. 
NEH.9.12	Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.
NEH.9.13	“You also came down on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments, 
NEH.9.14	and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant, 
NEH.9.15	and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought water out of the rock for them for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.
NEH.9.16	“But they and our fathers behaved proudly, hardened their neck, didn’t listen to your commandments, 
NEH.9.17	and refused to obey. They weren’t mindful of your wonders that you did amongst them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn’t forsake them. 
NEH.9.18	Yes, when they had made themselves a moulded calf, and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed awful blasphemies; 
NEH.9.19	yet you in your manifold mercies didn’t forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud didn’t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither did the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go. 
NEH.9.20	You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn’t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.
NEH.9.21	“Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their clothes didn’t grow old, and their feet didn’t swell. 
NEH.9.22	Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted according to their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. 
NEH.9.23	You also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.
NEH.9.24	“So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they pleased. 
NEH.9.25	They took fortified cities and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.
NEH.9.26	“Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, cast your law behind their back, killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies. 
NEH.9.27	Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. In the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviours who saved them out of the hands of their adversaries. 
NEH.9.28	But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore you left them in the hands of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies, 
NEH.9.29	and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they were arrogant, and didn’t listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances (which if a man does, he shall live in them), turned their backs, stiffened their neck, and would not hear. 
NEH.9.30	Yet many years you put up with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they would not listen. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
NEH.9.31	“Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you didn’t make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.
NEH.9.32	Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, don’t let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, on our priests, on our prophets, on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day. 
NEH.9.33	However you are just in all that has come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly. 
NEH.9.34	Also our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them. 
NEH.9.35	For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land which you gave before them. They didn’t turn from their wicked works.
NEH.9.36	“Behold, we are servants today, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good, behold, we are servants in it. 
NEH.9.37	It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. Also they have power over our bodies and over our livestock, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress. 
NEH.9.38	Yet for all this, we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal it.”
NEH.10.1	Now those who sealed were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah, 
NEH.10.2	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.10.3	Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah, 
NEH.10.4	Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, 
NEH.10.5	Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah, 
NEH.10.6	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, 
NEH.10.7	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, 
NEH.10.8	Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah. These were the priests. 
NEH.10.9	The Levites: namely, Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel; 
NEH.10.10	and their brothers, Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, 
NEH.10.11	Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, 
NEH.10.12	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah, 
NEH.10.13	Hodiah, Bani, and Beninu. 
NEH.10.14	The chiefs of the people: Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 
NEH.10.15	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, 
NEH.10.16	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 
NEH.10.17	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 
NEH.10.18	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, 
NEH.10.19	Hariph, Anathoth, Nobai, 
NEH.10.20	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, 
NEH.10.21	Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua, 
NEH.10.22	Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah, 
NEH.10.23	Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub, 
NEH.10.24	Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek, 
NEH.10.25	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, 
NEH.10.26	Ahiah, Hanan, Anan, 
NEH.10.27	Malluch, Harim, and Baanah.
NEH.10.28	The rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters—everyone who had knowledge, and understanding— 
NEH.10.29	joined with their brothers, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the 
NEH.10.30	and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons; 
NEH.10.31	and if the peoples of the land bring wares or any grain on the Sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy from them on the Sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
NEH.10.32	Also we made ordinances for ourselves, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel
NEH.10.33	for the show bread, for the continual meal offering, for the continual burnt offering, for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God. 
NEH.10.34	We, the priests, the Levites, and the people, cast lots for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathers’ houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn on the 
NEH.10.35	and to bring the first fruits of our ground, and the first fruits of all fruit of all kinds of trees, year by year, to the 
NEH.10.36	also the firstborn of our sons, and of our livestock, as it is written in the law, and the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God; 
NEH.10.37	and that we should bring the first fruits of our dough, our wave offerings, the fruit of all kinds of trees, and the new wine and the oil, to the priests, to the rooms of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground to the Levites; for they, the Levites, take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage. 
NEH.10.38	The priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes. The Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, to the rooms, into the treasure house. 
NEH.10.39	For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the wave offering of the grain, of the new wine, and of the oil, to the rooms, where the vessels of the sanctuary are, and the priests who minister, with the gatekeepers and the singers. We will not forsake the house of our God.
NEH.11.1	The princes of the people lived in Jerusalem. The rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the other cities. 
NEH.11.2	The people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem.
NEH.11.3	Now these are the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem; but in the cities of Judah everyone lived in his possession in their cities: Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the children of Solomon’s servants. 
NEH.11.4	Some of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez; 
NEH.11.5	and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite. 
NEH.11.6	All the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were four hundred and sixty-eight valiant men.
NEH.11.7	These are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah. 
NEH.11.8	After him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred and twenty-eight. 
NEH.11.9	Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer; and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city.
NEH.11.10	Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin, 
NEH.11.11	Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of God’s house, 
NEH.11.12	and their brothers who did the work of the house, eight hundred and twenty-two; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, 
NEH.11.13	and his brothers, chiefs of fathers’ households, two hundred and forty-two; and Amashsai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, 
NEH.11.14	and their brothers, mighty men of valour, one hundred and twenty-eight; and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of Haggedolim.
NEH.11.15	Of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 
NEH.11.16	and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chiefs of the Levites, who had the oversight of the outward business of God’s house; 
NEH.11.17	and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second amongst his brothers; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 
NEH.11.18	All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred and eighty-four.
NEH.11.19	Moreover the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers, who kept watch at the gates, were one hundred and seventy-two. 
NEH.11.20	The residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, everyone in his inheritance. 
NEH.11.21	But the temple servants lived in Ophel: and Ziha and Gishpa were over the temple servants.
NEH.11.22	The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of God’s house. 
NEH.11.23	For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as every day required. 
NEH.11.24	Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people.
NEH.11.25	As for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its towns, in Dibon and its towns, in Jekabzeel and its villages, 
NEH.11.26	in Jeshua, in Moladah, Beth Pelet, 
NEH.11.27	in Hazar Shual, in Beersheba and its towns, 
NEH.11.28	in Ziklag, in Meconah and in its towns, 
NEH.11.29	in En Rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth, 
NEH.11.30	Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, and Azekah and its towns. So they encamped from Beersheba to the valley of Hinnom. 
NEH.11.31	The children of Benjamin also lived from Geba onward, at Michmash and Aija, and at Bethel and its towns, 
NEH.11.32	at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 
NEH.11.33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 
NEH.11.34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 
NEH.11.35	Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. 
NEH.11.36	Of the Levites, certain divisions in Judah settled in Benjamin’s territory.
NEH.12.1	Now these are the priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 
NEH.12.2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 
NEH.12.3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 
NEH.12.4	Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, 
NEH.12.5	Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 
NEH.12.6	Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah, 
NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua.
NEH.12.8	Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brothers. 
NEH.12.9	Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brothers, were close to them according to their offices. 
NEH.12.10	Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada, 
NEH.12.11	and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua.
NEH.12.12	In the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers’ households: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; 
NEH.12.13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
NEH.12.14	of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 
NEH.12.15	of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 
NEH.12.16	of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
NEH.12.17	of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; 
NEH.12.18	of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
NEH.12.19	and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
NEH.12.20	of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 
NEH.12.21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
NEH.12.22	As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathers’ households; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian. 
NEH.12.23	The sons of Levi, heads of fathers’ households, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. 
NEH.12.24	The chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers close to them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next to watch. 
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates. 
NEH.12.26	These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest and scribe.
NEH.12.27	At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with giving thanks, and with singing, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and with harps. 
NEH.12.28	The sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites; 
NEH.12.29	also from Beth Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	The priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
NEH.12.31	Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession. One went on the right hand on the wall towards the dung gate; 
NEH.12.32	and after them went Hoshaiah, with half of the princes of Judah, 
NEH.12.33	and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph; 
NEH.12.36	and his brothers, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them. 
NEH.12.37	By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of David’s city, at the ascent of the wall, above David’s house, even to the water gate eastward.
NEH.12.38	The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, on the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even to the wide wall, 
NEH.12.39	and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard. 
NEH.12.40	So the two companies of those who gave thanks in God’s house stood, and I, and the half of the rulers with me; 
NEH.12.41	and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; 
NEH.12.42	and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. 
NEH.12.43	They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women and the children also rejoiced; so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even far away.
NEH.12.44	On that day, men were appointed over the rooms for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who served. 
NEH.12.45	They performed the duty of their God, and the duty of the purification, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son. 
NEH.12.46	For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
NEH.12.47	All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the gatekeepers, as every day required; and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.
NEH.13.1	On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and it was found written in it that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever, 
NEH.13.2	because they didn’t meet the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them; however our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
NEH.13.3	It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.
NEH.13.4	Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah, 
NEH.13.5	had prepared for him a great room, where before they laid the meal offerings, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers; and the wave offerings for the priests. 
NEH.13.6	But in all this, I was not at Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king; and after some days I asked leave of the king, 
NEH.13.7	and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a room in the courts of God’s house. 
NEH.13.8	It grieved me severely. Therefore I threw all Tobiah’s household stuff out of the room. 
NEH.13.9	Then I commanded, and they cleansed the rooms. I brought into them the vessels of God’s house, with the meal offerings and the frankincense again.
NEH.13.10	I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had each fled to his field. 
NEH.13.11	Then I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is God’s house forsaken?” I gathered them together, and set them in their place. 
NEH.13.12	Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the treasuries. 
NEH.13.13	I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers.
NEH.13.14	Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don’t wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its observances.
NEH.13.15	In those days I saw some men treading wine presses on the Sabbath in Judah, bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys; also with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; and I testified against them in the day in which they sold food. 
NEH.13.16	Some men of Tyre also lived there, who brought in fish and all kinds of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.17	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day? 
NEH.13.18	Didn’t your fathers do this, and didn’t our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”
NEH.13.19	It came to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I set some of my servants over the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day. 
NEH.13.20	So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares camped outside of Jerusalem once or twice. 
NEH.13.21	Then I testified against them, and said to them, “Why do you stay around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they didn’t come on the Sabbath. 
NEH.13.22	I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember me for this also, my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness.
NEH.13.23	In those days I also saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab; 
NEH.13.24	and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people. 
NEH.13.25	I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves. 
NEH.13.26	Didn’t Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet amongst many nations there was no king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin. 
NEH.13.27	Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?”
NEH.13.28	One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased him from me. 
NEH.13.29	Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
NEH.13.30	Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners, and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work; 
NEH.13.31	and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.
EST.1.1	Now in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces), 
EST.1.2	in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Susa the palace, 
EST.1.3	in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him. 
EST.1.4	He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred and eighty days. 
EST.1.5	When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Susa the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace. 
EST.1.6	There were hangings of white and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble. 
EST.1.7	They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king. 
EST.1.8	In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.
EST.1.9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, 
EST.1.11	to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful. 
EST.1.12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the eunuchs. Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burnt in him.
EST.1.13	Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times (for it was the king’s custom to consult those who knew law and judgement; 
EST.1.14	and next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and sat first in the kingdom), 
EST.1.15	“What shall we do to Queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?”
EST.1.16	Memucan answered before the king and the princes, “Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus. 
EST.1.17	For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn’t come.’ 
EST.1.18	Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s deed will tell all the king’s princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath.
EST.1.19	“If it pleases the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written amongst the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she. 
EST.1.20	When the king’s decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honour, both great and small.”
EST.1.21	This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan: 
EST.1.22	for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people.
EST.2.1	After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. 
EST.2.2	Then the king’s servants who served him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. 
EST.2.3	Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women’s house, to the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them; 
EST.2.4	and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The thing pleased the king, and he did so.
EST.2.5	There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite, 
EST.2.6	who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. 
EST.2.7	He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.
EST.2.8	So, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. 
EST.2.9	The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king’s house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women’s house. 
EST.2.10	Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known. 
EST.2.11	Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women’s house, to find out how Esther was doing, and what would become of her.
EST.2.12	Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women). 
EST.2.13	The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women’s house to the king’s house. 
EST.2.14	In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women’s house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name. 
EST.2.15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favour in the sight of all those who looked at her.
EST.2.16	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 
EST.2.17	The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favour and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
EST.2.18	Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king’s bounty.
EST.2.19	When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate. 
EST.2.20	Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him. 
EST.2.21	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus. 
EST.2.22	This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name. 
EST.2.23	When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king’s presence.
EST.3.1	After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him. 
EST.3.2	All the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn’t bow down or pay him homage. 
EST.3.3	Then the king’s servants, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s commandment?” 
EST.3.4	Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn’t listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew. 
EST.3.5	When Haman saw that Mordecai didn’t bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath. 
EST.3.6	But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai’s people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai’s people.
EST.3.7	In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. 
EST.3.8	Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed amongst the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different from other people’s. They don’t keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not for the king’s profit to allow them to remain. 
EST.3.9	If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents
EST.3.10	The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy. 
EST.3.11	The king said to Haman, “The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.”
EST.3.12	Then the king’s scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king’s local governors, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king’s ring. 
EST.3.13	Letters were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions. 
EST.3.14	A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day. 
EST.3.15	The couriers went out in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was perplexed.
EST.4.1	Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, and wailed loudly and bitterly. 
EST.4.2	He came even before the king’s gate, for no one is allowed inside the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth. 
EST.4.3	In every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning amongst the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
EST.4.4	Esther’s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn’t receive it. 
EST.4.5	Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was. 
EST.4.6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king’s gate. 
EST.4.7	Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. 
EST.4.8	He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Susa to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.
EST.4.9	Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. 
EST.4.10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai: 
EST.4.11	“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.”
EST.4.12	They told Esther’s words to Mordecai. 
EST.4.13	Then Mordecai asked them to return this answer to Esther: “Don’t think to yourself that you will escape in the king’s house any more than all the Jews. 
EST.4.14	For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you haven’t come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”
EST.4.15	Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai, 
EST.4.16	“Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Susa, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.” 
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
EST.5.1	Now on the third day, Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, next to the king’s house. The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house. 
EST.5.2	When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favour in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the sceptre. 
EST.5.3	Then the king asked her, “What would you like, queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.”
EST.5.4	Esther said, “If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”
EST.5.5	Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
EST.5.6	The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”
EST.5.7	Then Esther answered and said, “My petition and my request is this. 
EST.5.8	If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.”
EST.5.9	Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he didn’t stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. 
EST.5.10	Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife. 
EST.5.11	Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. 
EST.5.12	Haman also said, “Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king. 
EST.5.13	Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”
EST.5.14	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows be made fifty cubits
EST.6.1	On that night, the king couldn’t sleep. He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king. 
EST.6.2	It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus. 
EST.6.3	The king said, “What honour and dignity has been given to Mordecai for this?”
EST.6.3	Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”
EST.6.4	The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king’s house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
EST.6.5	The king’s servants said to him, “Behold,
EST.6.5	The king said, “Let him come in.” 
EST.6.6	So Haman came in. The king said to him, “What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honour?”
EST.6.6	Now Haman said in his heart, “Who would the king delight to honour more than myself?” 
EST.6.7	Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honour, 
EST.6.8	let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a royal crown is set. 
EST.6.9	Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honour with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honour!’”
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.”
EST.6.11	Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honour!”
EST.6.12	Mordecai came back to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered. 
EST.6.13	Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him.” 
EST.6.14	While they were yet talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. 
EST.7.2	The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, “What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”
EST.7.3	Then Esther the queen answered, “If I have found favour in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. 
EST.7.4	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for male and female slaves, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s loss.”
EST.7.5	Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, “Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?”
EST.7.6	Esther said, “An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!”
EST.7.6	Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. 
EST.7.7	The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. 
EST.7.8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house?” As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
EST.7.9	Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said, “Behold, the gallows fifty cubits
EST.7.9	The king said, “Hang him on it!”
EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath was pacified.
EST.8.1	On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews’ enemy, to Esther the queen. Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her. 
EST.8.2	The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
EST.8.3	Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his plan that he had planned against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king. 
EST.8.5	She said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seems right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces. 
EST.8.6	For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?”
EST.8.7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews. 
EST.8.8	Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may not be reversed by any man.”
EST.8.9	Then the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which is the month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the local governors, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language. 
EST.8.10	He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback, riding on royal horses that were bred from swift steeds. 
EST.8.11	In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their life, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to plunder their possessions, 
EST.8.12	on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. 
EST.8.13	A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 
EST.8.14	So the couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.
EST.8.15	Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad. 
EST.8.16	The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honour. 
EST.8.17	In every province, and in every city, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast, and a good day. Many from amongst the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews had fallen on them.
EST.9.1	Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king’s commandment and his decree came near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it was turned out the opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated them), 
EST.9.2	the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them. No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people. 
EST.9.3	All the princes of the provinces, the local governors, the governors, and those who did the king’s business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them. 
EST.9.4	For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater. 
EST.9.5	The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them. 
EST.9.6	In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. 
EST.9.7	They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy, but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.
EST.9.11	On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king. 
EST.9.12	The king said to Esther the queen, “The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your further request? It shall be done.”
EST.9.13	Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”
EST.9.14	The king commanded this to be done. A decree was given out in Susa; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons. 
EST.9.15	The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Susa; but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.
EST.9.16	The other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder. 
EST.9.17	This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
EST.9.18	But the Jews who were in Susa assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 
EST.9.19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents of food to one another.
EST.9.20	Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far, 
EST.9.21	to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly, 
EST.9.22	as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy. 
EST.9.23	The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them; 
EST.9.24	because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast “Pur”, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them; 
EST.9.25	but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked plan, which he had planned against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
EST.9.26	Therefore they called these days “Purim”,
EST.9.27	the Jews established and imposed on themselves, and on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to its appointed time, every year; 
EST.9.28	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from amongst the Jews, nor their memory perish from their offspring.
EST.9.29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim. 
EST.9.30	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, 
EST.9.31	to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry. 
EST.9.32	The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
EST.10.1	King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands of the sea. 
EST.10.2	Aren’t all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 
EST.10.3	For Mordecai the Jew was next to King Ahasuerus, and great amongst the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brothers, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his descendants.
JOB.1.1	There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God,
JOB.1.2	There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.1.3	His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. 
JOB.1.4	His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
JOB.1.5	It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.
JOB.1.6	Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before the 
JOB.1.7	The 
JOB.1.7	Then Satan answered the 
JOB.1.8	The 
JOB.1.9	Then Satan answered the 
JOB.1.10	Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
JOB.1.11	But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”
JOB.1.12	The 
JOB.1.12	So Satan went out from the presence of the 
JOB.1.13	It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.14	that a messenger came to Job, and said, “The oxen were ploughing, and the donkeys feeding beside them, 
JOB.1.15	and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.16	While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burnt up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.17	While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.18	While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.19	and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”
JOB.1.20	Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped. 
JOB.1.21	He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return there. The 
JOB.1.22	In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.
JOB.2.1	Again, on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before the 
JOB.2.2	The 
JOB.2.2	Satan answered the 
JOB.2.3	The 
JOB.2.4	Satan answered the 
JOB.2.5	But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.”
JOB.2.6	The 
JOB.2.7	So Satan went out from the presence of the 
JOB.2.8	He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat amongst the ashes. 
JOB.2.9	Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”
JOB.2.10	But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?”
JOB.2.10	In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips. 
JOB.2.11	Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathise with him and to comfort him. 
JOB.2.12	When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognise him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads towards the sky. 
JOB.2.13	So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.
JOB.3.1	After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth. 
JOB.3.2	Job answered:
JOB.3.3	“Let the day perish in which I was born,
JOB.3.3	the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’
JOB.3.4	Let that day be darkness.
JOB.3.4	Don’t let God from above seek for it,
JOB.3.4	neither let the light shine on it.
JOB.3.5	Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.
JOB.3.5	Let a cloud dwell on it.
JOB.3.5	Let all that makes the day black terrify it.
JOB.3.6	As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.
JOB.3.6	Let it not rejoice amongst the days of the year.
JOB.3.6	Let it not come into the number of the months.
JOB.3.7	Behold, let that night be barren.
JOB.3.7	Let no joyful voice come therein.
JOB.3.8	Let them curse it who curse the day,
JOB.3.8	who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
JOB.3.9	Let the stars of its twilight be dark.
JOB.3.9	Let it look for light, but have none,
JOB.3.9	neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,
JOB.3.10	because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,
JOB.3.10	nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
JOB.3.11	“Why didn’t I die from the womb?
JOB.3.11	Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees receive me?
JOB.3.12	Or why the breast, that I should nurse?
JOB.3.13	For now I should have lain down and been quiet.
JOB.3.13	I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,
JOB.3.14	with kings and counsellors of the earth,
JOB.3.14	who built up waste places for themselves;
JOB.3.15	or with princes who had gold,
JOB.3.15	who filled their houses with silver:
JOB.3.16	or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,
JOB.3.16	as infants who never saw light.
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease from troubling.
JOB.3.17	There the weary are at rest.
JOB.3.18	There the prisoners are at ease together.
JOB.3.18	They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.
JOB.3.19	The small and the great are there.
JOB.3.19	The servant is free from his master.
JOB.3.20	“Why is light given to him who is in misery,
JOB.3.20	life to the bitter in soul,
JOB.3.21	Who long for death, but it doesn’t come;
JOB.3.21	and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
JOB.3.22	who rejoice exceedingly,
JOB.3.22	and are glad, when they can find the grave?
JOB.3.23	Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,
JOB.3.23	whom God has hedged in?
JOB.3.24	For my sighing comes before I eat.
JOB.3.24	My groanings are poured out like water.
JOB.3.25	For the thing which I fear comes on me,
JOB.3.25	That which I am afraid of comes to me.
JOB.3.26	I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither do I have rest;
JOB.3.26	but trouble comes.”
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
JOB.4.2	“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?
JOB.4.2	But who can withhold himself from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Behold, you have instructed many,
JOB.4.3	you have strengthened the weak hands.
JOB.4.4	Your words have supported him who was falling,
JOB.4.4	You have made the feeble knees firm.
JOB.4.5	But now it has come to you, and you faint.
JOB.4.5	It touches you, and you are troubled.
JOB.4.6	Isn’t your piety your confidence?
JOB.4.6	Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?
JOB.4.7	“Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?
JOB.4.7	Or where were the upright cut off?
JOB.4.8	According to what I have seen, those who plough iniquity,
JOB.4.8	and sow trouble,
JOB.4.8	reap the same.
JOB.4.9	By the breath of God they perish.
JOB.4.9	By the blast of his anger are they consumed.
JOB.4.10	The roaring of the lion,
JOB.4.10	and the voice of the fierce lion,
JOB.4.10	the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
JOB.4.11	The old lion perishes for lack of prey.
JOB.4.11	The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.
JOB.4.12	“Now a thing was secretly brought to me.
JOB.4.12	My ear received a whisper of it.
JOB.4.13	In thoughts from the visions of the night,
JOB.4.13	when deep sleep falls on men,
JOB.4.14	fear came on me, and trembling,
JOB.4.14	which made all my bones shake.
JOB.4.15	Then a spirit passed before my face.
JOB.4.15	The hair of my flesh stood up.
JOB.4.16	It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance.
JOB.4.16	A form was before my eyes.
JOB.4.16	Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,
JOB.4.17	‘Shall mortal man be more just than God?
JOB.4.17	Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
JOB.4.18	Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.
JOB.4.18	He charges his angels with error.
JOB.4.19	How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay,
JOB.4.19	whose foundation is in the dust,
JOB.4.19	who are crushed before the moth!
JOB.4.20	Between morning and evening they are destroyed.
JOB.4.20	They perish forever without any regarding it.
JOB.4.21	Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them?
JOB.4.21	They die, and that without wisdom.’
JOB.5.1	“Call now; is there any who will answer you?
JOB.5.1	To which of the holy ones will you turn?
JOB.5.2	For resentment kills the foolish man,
JOB.5.2	and jealousy kills the simple.
JOB.5.3	I have seen the foolish taking root,
JOB.5.3	but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
JOB.5.4	His children are far from safety.
JOB.5.4	They are crushed in the gate.
JOB.5.4	Neither is there any to deliver them,
JOB.5.5	whose harvest the hungry eats up,
JOB.5.5	and take it even out of the thorns.
JOB.5.5	The snare gapes for their substance.
JOB.5.6	For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust,
JOB.5.6	neither does trouble spring out of the ground;
JOB.5.7	but man is born to trouble,
JOB.5.7	as the sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	“But as for me, I would seek God.
JOB.5.8	I would commit my cause to God,
JOB.5.9	who does great things that can’t be fathomed,
JOB.5.9	marvellous things without number;
JOB.5.10	who gives rain on the earth,
JOB.5.10	and sends waters on the fields;
JOB.5.11	so that he sets up on high those who are low,
JOB.5.11	those who mourn are exalted to safety.
JOB.5.12	He frustrates the plans of the crafty,
JOB.5.12	So that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.
JOB.5.13	He takes the wise in their own craftiness;
JOB.5.13	the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.
JOB.5.14	They meet with darkness in the day time,
JOB.5.14	and grope at noonday as in the night.
JOB.5.15	But he saves from the sword of their mouth,
JOB.5.15	even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
JOB.5.16	So the poor has hope,
JOB.5.16	and injustice shuts her mouth.
JOB.5.17	“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects.
JOB.5.17	Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.
JOB.5.18	For he wounds and binds up.
JOB.5.18	He injures and his hands make whole.
JOB.5.19	He will deliver you in six troubles;
JOB.5.19	yes, in seven no evil will touch you.
JOB.5.20	In famine he will redeem you from death;
JOB.5.20	in war, from the power of the sword.
JOB.5.21	You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
JOB.5.21	neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes.
JOB.5.22	You will laugh at destruction and famine,
JOB.5.22	neither will you be afraid of the animals of the earth.
JOB.5.23	For you will be allied with the stones of the field.
JOB.5.23	The animals of the field will be at peace with you.
JOB.5.24	You will know that your tent is in peace.
JOB.5.24	You will visit your fold, and will miss nothing.
JOB.5.25	You will know also that your offspring
JOB.5.25	Your offspring as the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	You will come to your grave in a full age,
JOB.5.26	like a shock of grain comes in its season.
JOB.5.27	Look at this. We have searched it. It is so.
JOB.5.27	Hear it, and know it for your good.”
JOB.6.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.6.2	“Oh that my anguish were weighed,
JOB.6.2	and all my calamity laid in the balances!
JOB.6.3	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,
JOB.6.3	therefore my words have been rash.
JOB.6.4	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.
JOB.6.4	My spirit drinks up their poison.
JOB.6.4	The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
JOB.6.5	Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?
JOB.6.5	Or does the ox low over his fodder?
JOB.6.6	Can that which has no flavour be eaten without salt?
JOB.6.6	Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
JOB.6.7	My soul refuses to touch them.
JOB.6.7	They are as loathsome food to me.
JOB.6.8	“Oh that I might have my request,
JOB.6.8	that God would grant the thing that I long for,
JOB.6.9	even that it would please God to crush me;
JOB.6.9	that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
JOB.6.10	Let it still be my consolation,
JOB.6.10	yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare,
JOB.6.10	that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	What is my strength, that I should wait?
JOB.6.11	What is my end, that I should be patient?
JOB.6.12	Is my strength the strength of stones?
JOB.6.12	Or is my flesh of bronze?
JOB.6.13	Isn’t it that I have no help in me,
JOB.6.13	that wisdom is driven away from me?
JOB.6.14	“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend;
JOB.6.14	even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,
JOB.6.15	as the channel of brooks that pass away;
JOB.6.16	Which are black by reason of the ice,
JOB.6.16	in which the snow hides itself.
JOB.6.17	In the dry season, they vanish.
JOB.6.17	When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
JOB.6.18	The caravans that travel beside them turn away.
JOB.6.18	They go up into the waste, and perish.
JOB.6.19	The caravans of Tema looked.
JOB.6.19	The companies of Sheba waited for them.
JOB.6.20	They were distressed because they were confident.
JOB.6.20	They came there, and were confounded.
JOB.6.21	For now you are nothing.
JOB.6.21	You see a terror, and are afraid.
JOB.6.22	Did I say, ‘Give to me?’
JOB.6.22	or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’
JOB.6.23	or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?’
JOB.6.23	or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?’
JOB.6.24	“Teach me, and I will hold my peace.
JOB.6.24	Cause me to understand my error.
JOB.6.25	How forcible are words of uprightness!
JOB.6.25	But your reproof, what does it reprove?
JOB.6.26	Do you intend to reprove words,
JOB.6.26	since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?
JOB.6.27	Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,
JOB.6.27	and make merchandise of your friend.
JOB.6.28	Now therefore be pleased to look at me,
JOB.6.28	for surely I will not lie to your face.
JOB.6.29	Please return.
JOB.6.29	Let there be no injustice.
JOB.6.29	Yes, return again.
JOB.6.29	My cause is righteous.
JOB.6.30	Is there injustice on my tongue?
JOB.6.30	Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?
JOB.7.1	“Isn’t a man forced to labour on earth?
JOB.7.1	Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?
JOB.7.2	As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow,
JOB.7.2	as a hireling who looks for his wages,
JOB.7.3	so I am made to possess months of misery,
JOB.7.3	wearisome nights are appointed to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down, I say,
JOB.7.4	‘When will I arise, and the night be gone?’
JOB.7.4	I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.
JOB.7.5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.
JOB.7.5	My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.
JOB.7.6	My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,
JOB.7.6	and are spent without hope.
JOB.7.7	Oh remember that my life is a breath.
JOB.7.7	My eye will no more see good.
JOB.7.8	The eye of him who sees me will see me no more.
JOB.7.8	Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.
JOB.7.9	As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,
JOB.7.9	so he who goes down to Sheol
JOB.7.10	He will return no more to his house,
JOB.7.10	neither will his place know him any more.
JOB.7.11	“Therefore I will not keep silent.
JOB.7.11	I will speak in the anguish of my spirit.
JOB.7.11	I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.7.12	Am I a sea, or a sea monster,
JOB.7.12	that you put a guard over me?
JOB.7.13	When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me.
JOB.7.13	My couch will ease my complaint;’
JOB.7.14	then you scare me with dreams,
JOB.7.14	and terrify me through visions:
JOB.7.15	so that my soul chooses strangling,
JOB.7.15	death rather than my bones.
JOB.7.16	I loathe my life.
JOB.7.16	I don’t want to live forever.
JOB.7.16	Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.
JOB.7.17	What is man, that you should magnify him,
JOB.7.17	that you should set your mind on him,
JOB.7.18	that you should visit him every morning,
JOB.7.18	and test him every moment?
JOB.7.19	How long will you not look away from me,
JOB.7.19	nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?
JOB.7.20	If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men?
JOB.7.20	Why have you set me as a mark for you,
JOB.7.20	so that I am a burden to myself?
JOB.7.21	Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity?
JOB.7.21	For now will I lie down in the dust.
JOB.7.21	You will seek me diligently, but I will not be.”
JOB.8.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
JOB.8.2	“How long will you speak these things?
JOB.8.2	Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
JOB.8.3	Does God pervert justice?
JOB.8.3	Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
JOB.8.4	If your children have sinned against him,
JOB.8.4	he has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.
JOB.8.5	If you want to seek God diligently,
JOB.8.5	make your supplication to the Almighty.
JOB.8.6	If you were pure and upright,
JOB.8.6	surely now he would awaken for you,
JOB.8.6	and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.
JOB.8.7	Though your beginning was small,
JOB.8.7	yet your latter end would greatly increase.
JOB.8.8	“Please enquire of past generations.
JOB.8.8	Find out about the learning of their fathers.
JOB.8.9	(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
JOB.8.9	because our days on earth are a shadow.)
JOB.8.10	Shall they not teach you, tell you,
JOB.8.10	and utter words out of their heart?
JOB.8.11	“Can the papyrus grow up without mire?
JOB.8.11	Can the rushes grow without water?
JOB.8.12	While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down,
JOB.8.12	it withers before any other reed.
JOB.8.13	So are the paths of all who forget God.
JOB.8.13	The hope of the godless man will perish,
JOB.8.14	Whose confidence will break apart,
JOB.8.14	Whose trust is a spider’s web.
JOB.8.15	He will lean on his house, but it will not stand.
JOB.8.15	He will cling to it, but it will not endure.
JOB.8.16	He is green before the sun.
JOB.8.16	His shoots go out along his garden.
JOB.8.17	His roots are wrapped around the rock pile.
JOB.8.17	He sees the place of stones.
JOB.8.18	If he is destroyed from his place,
JOB.8.18	then it will deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’
JOB.8.19	Behold, this is the joy of his way:
JOB.8.19	out of the earth, others will spring.
JOB.8.20	“Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man,
JOB.8.20	neither will he uphold the evildoers.
JOB.8.21	He will still fill your mouth with laughter,
JOB.8.21	your lips with shouting.
JOB.8.22	Those who hate you will be clothed with shame.
JOB.8.22	The tent of the wicked will be no more.”
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.9.2	“Truly I know that it is so,
JOB.9.2	but how can man be just with God?
JOB.9.3	If he is pleased to contend with him,
JOB.9.3	he can’t answer him one time in a thousand.
JOB.9.4	God is wise in heart, and mighty in strength.
JOB.9.4	Who has hardened himself against him and prospered?
JOB.9.5	He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it,
JOB.9.5	when he overturns them in his anger.
JOB.9.6	He shakes the earth out of its place.
JOB.9.6	Its pillars tremble.
JOB.9.7	He commands the sun and it doesn’t rise,
JOB.9.7	and seals up the stars.
JOB.9.8	He alone stretches out the heavens,
JOB.9.8	and treads on the waves of the sea.
JOB.9.9	He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
JOB.9.9	and the rooms of the south.
JOB.9.10	He does great things past finding out;
JOB.9.10	yes, marvellous things without number.
JOB.9.11	Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him.
JOB.9.11	He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him.
JOB.9.12	Behold, he snatches away.
JOB.9.12	Who can hinder him?
JOB.9.12	Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’
JOB.9.13	“God will not withdraw his anger.
JOB.9.13	The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.
JOB.9.14	How much less will I answer him,
JOB.9.14	And choose my words to argue with him?
JOB.9.15	Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him.
JOB.9.15	I would make supplication to my judge.
JOB.9.16	If I had called, and he had answered me,
JOB.9.16	yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice.
JOB.9.17	For he breaks me with a storm,
JOB.9.17	and multiplies my wounds without cause.
JOB.9.18	He will not allow me to catch my breath,
JOB.9.18	but fills me with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty!
JOB.9.19	If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’
JOB.9.20	Though I am righteous, my own mouth will condemn me.
JOB.9.20	Though I am blameless, it will prove me perverse.
JOB.9.21	I am blameless.
JOB.9.21	I don’t respect myself.
JOB.9.21	I despise my life.
JOB.9.22	“It is all the same.
JOB.9.22	Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked.
JOB.9.23	If the scourge kills suddenly,
JOB.9.23	he will mock at the trial of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.
JOB.9.24	He covers the faces of its judges.
JOB.9.24	If not he, then who is it?
JOB.9.25	“Now my days are swifter than a runner.
JOB.9.25	They flee away. They see no good.
JOB.9.26	They have passed away as the swift ships,
JOB.9.26	as the eagle that swoops on the prey.
JOB.9.27	If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
JOB.9.27	I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;’
JOB.9.28	I am afraid of all my sorrows,
JOB.9.28	I know that you will not hold me innocent.
JOB.9.29	I will be condemned.
JOB.9.29	Why then do I labour in vain?
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with snow,
JOB.9.30	and cleanse my hands with lye,
JOB.9.31	yet you will plunge me in the ditch.
JOB.9.31	My own clothes will abhor me.
JOB.9.32	For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,
JOB.9.32	that we should come together in judgement.
JOB.9.33	There is no umpire between us,
JOB.9.33	that might lay his hand on us both.
JOB.9.34	Let him take his rod away from me.
JOB.9.34	Let his terror not make me afraid;
JOB.9.35	then I would speak, and not fear him,
JOB.9.35	for I am not so in myself.
JOB.10.1	“My soul is weary of my life.
JOB.10.1	I will give free course to my complaint.
JOB.10.1	I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will tell God, ‘Do not condemn me.
JOB.10.2	Show me why you contend with me.
JOB.10.3	Is it good to you that you should oppress,
JOB.10.3	that you should despise the work of your hands,
JOB.10.3	and smile on the counsel of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Do you have eyes of flesh?
JOB.10.4	Or do you see as man sees?
JOB.10.5	Are your days as the days of mortals,
JOB.10.5	or your years as man’s years,
JOB.10.6	that you enquire after my iniquity,
JOB.10.6	and search after my sin?
JOB.10.7	Although you know that I am not wicked,
JOB.10.7	there is no one who can deliver out of your hand.
JOB.10.8	“‘Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether,
JOB.10.8	yet you destroy me.
JOB.10.9	Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay.
JOB.10.9	Will you bring me into dust again?
JOB.10.10	Haven’t you poured me out like milk,
JOB.10.10	and curdled me like cheese?
JOB.10.11	You have clothed me with skin and flesh,
JOB.10.11	and knit me together with bones and sinews.
JOB.10.12	You have granted me life and loving kindness.
JOB.10.12	Your visitation has preserved my spirit.
JOB.10.13	Yet you hid these things in your heart.
JOB.10.13	I know that this is with you:
JOB.10.14	if I sin, then you mark me.
JOB.10.14	You will not acquit me from my iniquity.
JOB.10.15	If I am wicked, woe to me.
JOB.10.15	If I am righteous, I still will not lift up my head,
JOB.10.15	being filled with disgrace,
JOB.10.15	and conscious of my affliction.
JOB.10.16	If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion.
JOB.10.16	Again you show yourself powerful to me.
JOB.10.17	You renew your witnesses against me,
JOB.10.17	and increase your indignation on me.
JOB.10.17	Changes and warfare are with me.
JOB.10.18	“‘Why, then, have you brought me out of the womb?
JOB.10.18	I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me.
JOB.10.19	I should have been as though I had not been.
JOB.10.19	I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
JOB.10.20	Aren’t my days few?
JOB.10.20	Stop!
JOB.10.20	Leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort,
JOB.10.21	before I go where I will not return from,
JOB.10.21	to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;
JOB.10.22	the land dark as midnight,
JOB.10.22	of the shadow of death,
JOB.10.22	without any order,
JOB.10.22	where the light is as midnight.’”
JOB.11.1	Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,
JOB.11.2	“Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered?
JOB.11.2	Should a man full of talk be justified?
JOB.11.3	Should your boastings make men hold their peace?
JOB.11.3	When you mock, will no man make you ashamed?
JOB.11.4	For you say, ‘My doctrine is pure.
JOB.11.4	I am clean in your eyes.’
JOB.11.5	But oh that God would speak,
JOB.11.5	and open his lips against you,
JOB.11.6	that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!
JOB.11.6	For true wisdom has two sides.
JOB.11.6	Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.
JOB.11.7	“Can you fathom the mystery of God?
JOB.11.7	Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
JOB.11.8	They are high as heaven. What can you do?
JOB.11.8	They are deeper than Sheol.
JOB.11.9	Its measure is longer than the earth,
JOB.11.9	and broader than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If he passes by, or confines,
JOB.11.10	or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?
JOB.11.11	For he knows false men.
JOB.11.11	He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn’t consider it.
JOB.11.12	An empty-headed man becomes wise
JOB.11.12	when a man is born as a wild donkey’s colt.
JOB.11.13	“If you set your heart aright,
JOB.11.13	stretch out your hands towards him.
JOB.11.14	If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away.
JOB.11.14	Don’t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.
JOB.11.15	Surely then you will lift up your face without spot;
JOB.11.15	Yes, you will be steadfast, and will not fear:
JOB.11.16	for you will forget your misery.
JOB.11.16	You will remember it like waters that have passed away.
JOB.11.17	Life will be clearer than the noonday.
JOB.11.17	Though there is darkness, it will be as the morning.
JOB.11.18	You will be secure, because there is hope.
JOB.11.18	Yes, you will search, and will take your rest in safety.
JOB.11.19	Also you will lie down, and no one will make you afraid.
JOB.11.19	Yes, many will court your favour.
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked will fail.
JOB.11.20	They will have no way to flee.
JOB.11.20	Their hope will be the giving up of the spirit.”
JOB.12.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.12.2	“No doubt, but you are the people,
JOB.12.2	and wisdom will die with you.
JOB.12.3	But I have understanding as well as you;
JOB.12.3	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.12.3	Yes, who doesn’t know such things as these?
JOB.12.4	I am like one who is a joke to his neighbour,
JOB.12.4	I, who called on God, and he answered.
JOB.12.4	The just, the blameless man is a joke.
JOB.12.5	In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune.
JOB.12.5	It is ready for them whose foot slips.
JOB.12.6	The tents of robbers prosper.
JOB.12.6	Those who provoke God are secure,
JOB.12.6	who carry their god in their hands.
JOB.12.7	“But ask the animals, now, and they will teach you;
JOB.12.7	the birds of the sky, and they will tell you.
JOB.12.8	Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you.
JOB.12.8	The fish of the sea will declare to you.
JOB.12.9	Who doesn’t know that in all these,
JOB.12.9	The 
JOB.12.10	in whose hand is the life of every living thing,
JOB.12.10	and the breath of all mankind?
JOB.12.11	Doesn’t the ear try words,
JOB.12.11	even as the palate tastes its food?
JOB.12.12	With aged men is wisdom,
JOB.12.12	in length of days understanding.
JOB.12.13	“With God is wisdom and might.
JOB.12.13	He has counsel and understanding.
JOB.12.14	Behold, he breaks down, and it can’t be built again.
JOB.12.14	He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.
JOB.12.15	Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up.
JOB.12.15	Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.
JOB.12.16	With him is strength and wisdom.
JOB.12.16	The deceived and the deceiver are his.
JOB.12.17	He leads counsellors away stripped.
JOB.12.17	He makes judges fools.
JOB.12.18	He loosens the bond of kings.
JOB.12.18	He binds their waist with a belt.
JOB.12.19	He leads priests away stripped,
JOB.12.19	and overthrows the mighty.
JOB.12.20	He removes the speech of those who are trusted,
JOB.12.20	and takes away the understanding of the elders.
JOB.12.21	He pours contempt on princes,
JOB.12.21	and loosens the belt of the strong.
JOB.12.22	He uncovers deep things out of darkness,
JOB.12.22	and brings out to light the shadow of death.
JOB.12.23	He increases the nations, and he destroys them.
JOB.12.23	He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive.
JOB.12.24	He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth,
JOB.12.24	and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
JOB.12.25	They grope in the dark without light.
JOB.12.25	He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
JOB.13.1	“Behold, my eye has seen all this.
JOB.13.1	My ear has heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	What you know, I know also.
JOB.13.2	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.13.3	“Surely I would speak to the Almighty.
JOB.13.3	I desire to reason with God.
JOB.13.4	But you are forgers of lies.
JOB.13.4	You are all physicians of no value.
JOB.13.5	Oh that you would be completely silent!
JOB.13.5	Then you would be wise.
JOB.13.6	Hear now my reasoning.
JOB.13.6	Listen to the pleadings of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Will you speak unrighteously for God,
JOB.13.7	and talk deceitfully for him?
JOB.13.8	Will you show partiality to him?
JOB.13.8	Will you contend for God?
JOB.13.9	Is it good that he should search you out?
JOB.13.9	Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?
JOB.13.10	He will surely reprove you
JOB.13.10	if you secretly show partiality.
JOB.13.11	Shall not his majesty make you afraid,
JOB.13.11	and his dread fall on you?
JOB.13.12	Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes.
JOB.13.12	Your defences are defences of clay.
JOB.13.13	“Be silent!
JOB.13.13	Leave me alone, that I may speak.
JOB.13.13	Let come on me what will.
JOB.13.14	Why should I take my flesh in my teeth,
JOB.13.14	and put my life in my hand?
JOB.13.15	Behold, he will kill me.
JOB.13.15	I have no hope.
JOB.13.15	Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him.
JOB.13.16	This also will be my salvation,
JOB.13.16	that a godless man will not come before him.
JOB.13.17	Listen carefully to my speech.
JOB.13.17	Let my declaration be in your ears.
JOB.13.18	See now, I have set my cause in order.
JOB.13.18	I know that I am righteous.
JOB.13.19	Who is he who will contend with me?
JOB.13.19	For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit.
JOB.13.20	“Only don’t do two things to me,
JOB.13.20	then I will not hide myself from your face:
JOB.13.21	withdraw your hand far from me,
JOB.13.21	and don’t let your terror make me afraid.
JOB.13.22	Then call, and I will answer,
JOB.13.22	or let me speak, and you answer me.
JOB.13.23	How many are my iniquities and sins?
JOB.13.23	Make me know my disobedience and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Why do you hide your face,
JOB.13.24	and consider me your enemy?
JOB.13.25	Will you harass a driven leaf?
JOB.13.25	Will you pursue the dry stubble?
JOB.13.26	For you write bitter things against me,
JOB.13.26	and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth:
JOB.13.27	You also put my feet in the stocks,
JOB.13.27	and mark all my paths.
JOB.13.27	You set a bound to the soles of my feet,
JOB.13.28	though I am decaying like a rotten thing,
JOB.13.28	like a garment that is moth-eaten.
JOB.14.1	“Man, who is born of a woman,
JOB.14.1	is of few days, and full of trouble.
JOB.14.2	He grows up like a flower, and is cut down.
JOB.14.2	He also flees like a shadow, and doesn’t continue.
JOB.14.3	Do you open your eyes on such a one,
JOB.14.3	and bring me into judgement with you?
JOB.14.4	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?
JOB.14.4	Not one.
JOB.14.5	Seeing his days are determined,
JOB.14.5	the number of his months is with you,
JOB.14.5	and you have appointed his bounds that he can’t pass;
JOB.14.6	Look away from him, that he may rest,
JOB.14.6	until he accomplishes, as a hireling, his day.
JOB.14.7	“For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down,
JOB.14.7	that it will sprout again,
JOB.14.7	that the tender branch of it will not cease.
JOB.14.8	Though its root grows old in the earth,
JOB.14.8	and its stock dies in the ground,
JOB.14.9	yet through the scent of water it will bud,
JOB.14.9	and sprout boughs like a plant.
JOB.14.10	But man dies, and is laid low.
JOB.14.10	Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?
JOB.14.11	As the waters fail from the sea,
JOB.14.11	and the river wastes and dries up,
JOB.14.12	so man lies down and doesn’t rise.
JOB.14.12	Until the heavens are no more, they will not awake,
JOB.14.12	nor be roused out of their sleep.
JOB.14.13	“Oh that you would hide me in Sheol,
JOB.14.13	that you would keep me secret until your wrath is past,
JOB.14.13	that you would appoint me a set time and remember me!
JOB.14.14	If a man dies, will he live again?
JOB.14.14	I would wait all the days of my warfare,
JOB.14.14	until my release should come.
JOB.14.15	You would call, and I would answer you.
JOB.14.15	You would have a desire for the work of your hands.
JOB.14.16	But now you count my steps.
JOB.14.16	Don’t you watch over my sin?
JOB.14.17	My disobedience is sealed up in a bag.
JOB.14.17	You fasten up my iniquity.
JOB.14.18	“But the mountain falling comes to nothing.
JOB.14.18	The rock is removed out of its place;
JOB.14.19	The waters wear the stones.
JOB.14.19	The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth.
JOB.14.19	So you destroy the hope of man.
JOB.14.20	You forever prevail against him, and he departs.
JOB.14.20	You change his face, and send him away.
JOB.14.21	His sons come to honour, and he doesn’t know it.
JOB.14.21	They are brought low, but he doesn’t perceive it of them.
JOB.14.22	But his flesh on him has pain,
JOB.14.22	and his soul within him mourns.”
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
JOB.15.2	“Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge,
JOB.15.2	and fill himself with the east wind?
JOB.15.3	Should he reason with unprofitable talk,
JOB.15.3	or with speeches with which he can do no good?
JOB.15.4	Yes, you do away with fear,
JOB.15.4	and hinder devotion before God.
JOB.15.5	For your iniquity teaches your mouth,
JOB.15.5	and you choose the language of the crafty.
JOB.15.6	Your own mouth condemns you, and not I.
JOB.15.6	Yes, your own lips testify against you.
JOB.15.7	“Are you the first man who was born?
JOB.15.7	Or were you brought out before the hills?
JOB.15.8	Have you heard the secret counsel of God?
JOB.15.8	Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
JOB.15.9	What do you know that we don’t know?
JOB.15.9	What do you understand which is not in us?
JOB.15.10	With us are both the grey-headed and the very aged men,
JOB.15.10	much older than your father.
JOB.15.11	Are the consolations of God too small for you,
JOB.15.11	even the word that is gentle towards you?
JOB.15.12	Why does your heart carry you away?
JOB.15.12	Why do your eyes flash,
JOB.15.13	that you turn your spirit against God,
JOB.15.13	and let such words go out of your mouth?
JOB.15.14	What is man, that he should be clean?
JOB.15.14	What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
JOB.15.15	Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones.
JOB.15.15	Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;
JOB.15.16	how much less one who is abominable and corrupt,
JOB.15.16	a man who drinks iniquity like water!
JOB.15.17	“I will show you, listen to me;
JOB.15.17	that which I have seen I will declare
JOB.15.18	(which wise men have told by their fathers,
JOB.15.18	and have not hidden it;
JOB.15.19	to whom alone the land was given,
JOB.15.19	and no stranger passed amongst them):
JOB.15.20	the wicked man writhes in pain all his days,
JOB.15.20	even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.
JOB.15.21	A sound of terrors is in his ears.
JOB.15.21	In prosperity the destroyer will come on him.
JOB.15.22	He doesn’t believe that he will return out of darkness.
JOB.15.22	He is waited for by the sword.
JOB.15.23	He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’
JOB.15.23	He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
JOB.15.24	Distress and anguish make him afraid.
JOB.15.24	They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
JOB.15.25	Because he has stretched out his hand against God,
JOB.15.25	and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty,
JOB.15.26	he runs at him with a stiff neck,
JOB.15.26	with the thick shields of his bucklers,
JOB.15.27	because he has covered his face with his fatness,
JOB.15.27	and gathered fat on his thighs.
JOB.15.28	He has lived in desolate cities,
JOB.15.28	in houses which no one inhabited,
JOB.15.28	which were ready to become heaps.
JOB.15.29	He will not be rich, neither will his substance continue,
JOB.15.29	neither will their possessions be extended on the earth.
JOB.15.30	He will not depart out of darkness.
JOB.15.30	The flame will dry up his branches.
JOB.15.30	He will go away by the breath of God’s mouth.
JOB.15.31	Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself;
JOB.15.31	for emptiness will be his reward.
JOB.15.32	It will be accomplished before his time.
JOB.15.32	His branch will not be green.
JOB.15.33	He will shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
JOB.15.33	and will cast off his flower as the olive tree.
JOB.15.34	For the company of the godless will be barren,
JOB.15.34	and fire will consume the tents of bribery.
JOB.15.35	They conceive mischief and produce iniquity.
JOB.15.35	Their heart prepares deceit.”
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.16.2	“I have heard many such things.
JOB.16.2	You are all miserable comforters!
JOB.16.3	Shall vain words have an end?
JOB.16.3	Or what provokes you that you answer?
JOB.16.4	I also could speak as you do.
JOB.16.4	If your soul were in my soul’s place,
JOB.16.4	I could join words together against you,
JOB.16.4	and shake my head at you,
JOB.16.5	but I would strengthen you with my mouth.
JOB.16.5	The solace of my lips would relieve you.
JOB.16.6	“Though I speak, my grief is not subsided.
JOB.16.6	Though I forbear, what am I eased?
JOB.16.7	But now, God, you have surely worn me out.
JOB.16.7	You have made all my company desolate.
JOB.16.8	You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me.
JOB.16.8	My leanness rises up against me.
JOB.16.8	It testifies to my face.
JOB.16.9	He has torn me in his wrath and persecuted me.
JOB.16.9	He has gnashed on me with his teeth.
JOB.16.9	My adversary sharpens his eyes on me.
JOB.16.10	They have gaped on me with their mouth.
JOB.16.10	They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully.
JOB.16.10	They gather themselves together against me.
JOB.16.11	God delivers me to the ungodly,
JOB.16.11	and casts me into the hands of the wicked.
JOB.16.12	I was at ease, and he broke me apart.
JOB.16.12	Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces.
JOB.16.12	He has also set me up for his target.
JOB.16.13	His archers surround me.
JOB.16.13	He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare.
JOB.16.13	He pours out my bile on the ground.
JOB.16.14	He breaks me with breach on breach.
JOB.16.14	He runs at me like a giant.
JOB.16.15	I have sewed sackcloth on my skin,
JOB.16.15	and have thrust my horn in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is red with weeping.
JOB.16.16	Deep darkness is on my eyelids,
JOB.16.17	although there is no violence in my hands,
JOB.16.17	and my prayer is pure.
JOB.16.18	“Earth, don’t cover my blood.
JOB.16.18	Let my cry have no place to rest.
JOB.16.19	Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven.
JOB.16.19	He who vouches for me is on high.
JOB.16.20	My friends scoff at me.
JOB.16.20	My eyes pour out tears to God,
JOB.16.21	that he would maintain the right of a man with God,
JOB.16.21	of a son of man with his neighbour!
JOB.16.22	For when a few years have come,
JOB.16.22	I will go the way of no return.
JOB.17.1	“My spirit is consumed.
JOB.17.1	My days are extinct,
JOB.17.1	and the grave is ready for me.
JOB.17.2	Surely there are mockers with me.
JOB.17.2	My eye dwells on their provocation.
JOB.17.3	“Now give a pledge. Be collateral for me with yourself.
JOB.17.3	Who is there who will strike hands with me?
JOB.17.4	For you have hidden their heart from understanding,
JOB.17.4	Therefore you will not exalt them.
JOB.17.5	He who denounces his friends for plunder,
JOB.17.5	Even the eyes of his children will fail.
JOB.17.6	“But he has made me a byword of the people.
JOB.17.6	They spit in my face.
JOB.17.7	My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow.
JOB.17.7	All my members are as a shadow.
JOB.17.8	Upright men will be astonished at this.
JOB.17.8	The innocent will stir himself up against the godless.
JOB.17.9	Yet the righteous will hold to his way.
JOB.17.9	He who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger.
JOB.17.10	But as for you all, come back.
JOB.17.10	I will not find a wise man amongst you.
JOB.17.11	My days are past.
JOB.17.11	My plans are broken off,
JOB.17.11	as are the thoughts of my heart.
JOB.17.12	They change the night into day,
JOB.17.12	saying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness.
JOB.17.13	If I look for Sheol
JOB.17.13	if I have spread my couch in the darkness,
JOB.17.14	if I have said to corruption, ‘You are my father;’
JOB.17.14	to the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘My sister,’
JOB.17.15	where then is my hope?
JOB.17.15	As for my hope, who will see it?
JOB.17.16	Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol,
JOB.17.16	or descend together into the dust?”
JOB.18.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
JOB.18.2	“How long will you hunt for words?
JOB.18.2	Consider, and afterwards we will speak.
JOB.18.3	Why are we counted as animals,
JOB.18.3	which have become unclean in your sight?
JOB.18.4	You who tear yourself in your anger,
JOB.18.4	will the earth be forsaken for you?
JOB.18.4	Or will the rock be removed out of its place?
JOB.18.5	“Yes, the light of the wicked will be put out.
JOB.18.5	The spark of his fire won’t shine.
JOB.18.6	The light will be dark in his tent.
JOB.18.6	His lamp above him will be put out.
JOB.18.7	The steps of his strength will be shortened.
JOB.18.7	His own counsel will cast him down.
JOB.18.8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
JOB.18.8	and he wanders into its mesh.
JOB.18.9	A snare will take him by the heel.
JOB.18.9	A trap will catch him.
JOB.18.10	A noose is hidden for him in the ground,
JOB.18.10	a trap for him on the path.
JOB.18.11	Terrors will make him afraid on every side,
JOB.18.11	and will chase him at his heels.
JOB.18.12	His strength will be famished.
JOB.18.12	Calamity will be ready at his side.
JOB.18.13	The members of his body will be devoured.
JOB.18.13	The firstborn of death will devour his members.
JOB.18.14	He will be rooted out of the security of his tent.
JOB.18.14	He will be brought to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	There will dwell in his tent that which is none of his.
JOB.18.15	Sulphur will be scattered on his habitation.
JOB.18.16	His roots will be dried up beneath.
JOB.18.16	His branch will be cut off above.
JOB.18.17	His memory will perish from the earth.
JOB.18.17	He will have no name in the street.
JOB.18.18	He will be driven from light into darkness,
JOB.18.18	and chased out of the world.
JOB.18.19	He will have neither son nor grandson amongst his people,
JOB.18.19	nor any remaining where he lived.
JOB.18.20	Those who come after will be astonished at his day,
JOB.18.20	as those who went before were frightened.
JOB.18.21	Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous.
JOB.18.21	This is the place of him who doesn’t know God.”
JOB.19.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.19.2	“How long will you torment me,
JOB.19.2	and crush me with words?
JOB.19.3	You have reproached me ten times.
JOB.19.3	You aren’t ashamed that you attack me.
JOB.19.4	If it is true that I have erred,
JOB.19.4	my error remains with myself.
JOB.19.5	If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me,
JOB.19.5	and plead against me my reproach,
JOB.19.6	know now that God has subverted me,
JOB.19.6	and has surrounded me with his net.
JOB.19.7	“Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard.
JOB.19.7	I cry for help, but there is no justice.
JOB.19.8	He has walled up my way so that I can’t pass,
JOB.19.8	and has set darkness in my paths.
JOB.19.9	He has stripped me of my glory,
JOB.19.9	and taken the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone.
JOB.19.10	He has plucked my hope up like a tree.
JOB.19.11	He has also kindled his wrath against me.
JOB.19.11	He counts me amongst his adversaries.
JOB.19.12	His troops come on together,
JOB.19.12	build a siege ramp against me,
JOB.19.12	and encamp around my tent.
JOB.19.13	“He has put my brothers far from me.
JOB.19.13	My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My relatives have gone away.
JOB.19.14	My familiar friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	Those who dwell in my house and my maids consider me a stranger.
JOB.19.15	I am an alien in their sight.
JOB.19.16	I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer.
JOB.19.16	I beg him with my mouth.
JOB.19.17	My breath is offensive to my wife.
JOB.19.17	I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.
JOB.19.18	Even young children despise me.
JOB.19.18	If I arise, they speak against me.
JOB.19.19	All my familiar friends abhor me.
JOB.19.19	They whom I loved have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh.
JOB.19.20	I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	“Have pity on me. Have pity on me, you my friends;
JOB.19.21	for the hand of God has touched me.
JOB.19.22	Why do you persecute me as God,
JOB.19.22	and are not satisfied with my flesh?
JOB.19.23	“Oh that my words were now written!
JOB.19.23	Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
JOB.19.24	That with an iron pen and lead
JOB.19.24	they were engraved in the rock forever!
JOB.19.25	But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives.
JOB.19.25	In the end, he will stand upon the earth.
JOB.19.26	After my skin is destroyed,
JOB.19.26	then I will see God in my flesh,
JOB.19.27	whom I, even I, will see on my side.
JOB.19.27	My eyes will see, and not as a stranger.
JOB.19.27	“My heart is consumed within me.
JOB.19.28	If you say, ‘How we will persecute him!’
JOB.19.28	because the root of the matter is found in me,
JOB.19.29	be afraid of the sword,
JOB.19.29	for wrath brings the punishments of the sword,
JOB.19.29	that you may know there is a judgement.”
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
JOB.20.2	“Therefore my thoughts answer me,
JOB.20.2	even by reason of my haste that is in me.
JOB.20.3	I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame.
JOB.20.3	The spirit of my understanding answers me.
JOB.20.4	Don’t you know this from old time,
JOB.20.4	since man was placed on earth,
JOB.20.5	that the triumphing of the wicked is short,
JOB.20.5	the joy of the godless but for a moment?
JOB.20.6	Though his height mount up to the heavens,
JOB.20.6	and his head reach to the clouds,
JOB.20.7	yet he will perish forever like his own dung.
JOB.20.7	Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’
JOB.20.8	He will fly away as a dream, and will not be found.
JOB.20.8	Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night.
JOB.20.9	The eye which saw him will see him no more,
JOB.20.9	neither will his place see him any more.
JOB.20.10	His children will seek the favour of the poor.
JOB.20.10	His hands will give back his wealth.
JOB.20.11	His bones are full of his youth,
JOB.20.11	but youth will lie down with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	“Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth,
JOB.20.12	though he hide it under his tongue,
JOB.20.13	though he spare it, and will not let it go,
JOB.20.13	but keep it still within his mouth;
JOB.20.14	yet his food in his bowels is turned.
JOB.20.14	It is cobra venom within him.
JOB.20.15	He has swallowed down riches, and he will vomit them up again.
JOB.20.15	God will cast them out of his belly.
JOB.20.16	He will suck cobra venom.
JOB.20.16	The viper’s tongue will kill him.
JOB.20.17	He will not look at the rivers,
JOB.20.17	the flowing streams of honey and butter.
JOB.20.18	He will restore that for which he laboured, and will not swallow it down.
JOB.20.18	He will not rejoice according to the substance that he has gotten.
JOB.20.19	For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor.
JOB.20.19	He has violently taken away a house, and he will not build it up.
JOB.20.20	“Because he knew no quietness within him,
JOB.20.20	he will not save anything of that in which he delights.
JOB.20.21	There was nothing left that he didn’t devour,
JOB.20.21	therefore his prosperity will not endure.
JOB.20.22	In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress will overtake him.
JOB.20.22	The hand of everyone who is in misery will come on him.
JOB.20.23	When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him.
JOB.20.23	It will rain on him while he is eating.
JOB.20.24	He will flee from the iron weapon.
JOB.20.24	The bronze arrow will strike him through.
JOB.20.25	He draws it out, and it comes out of his body.
JOB.20.25	Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver.
JOB.20.25	Terrors are on him.
JOB.20.26	All darkness is laid up for his treasures.
JOB.20.26	An unfanned fire will devour him.
JOB.20.26	It will consume that which is left in his tent.
JOB.20.27	The heavens will reveal his iniquity.
JOB.20.27	The earth will rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The increase of his house will depart.
JOB.20.28	They will rush away in the day of his wrath.
JOB.20.29	This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
JOB.20.29	the heritage appointed to him by God.”
JOB.21.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.21.2	“Listen diligently to my speech.
JOB.21.2	Let this be your consolation.
JOB.21.3	Allow me, and I also will speak;
JOB.21.3	After I have spoken, mock on.
JOB.21.4	As for me, is my complaint to man?
JOB.21.4	Why shouldn’t I be impatient?
JOB.21.5	Look at me, and be astonished.
JOB.21.5	Lay your hand on your mouth.
JOB.21.6	When I remember, I am troubled.
JOB.21.6	Horror takes hold of my flesh.
JOB.21.7	“Why do the wicked live,
JOB.21.7	become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?
JOB.21.8	Their child is established with them in their sight,
JOB.21.8	their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their houses are safe from fear,
JOB.21.9	neither is the rod of God upon them.
JOB.21.10	Their bulls breed without fail.
JOB.21.10	Their cows calve, and don’t miscarry.
JOB.21.11	They send out their little ones like a flock.
JOB.21.11	Their children dance.
JOB.21.12	They sing to the tambourine and harp,
JOB.21.12	and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in prosperity.
JOB.21.13	In an instant they go down to Sheol.
JOB.21.14	They tell God, ‘Depart from us,
JOB.21.14	for we don’t want to know about your ways.
JOB.21.15	What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
JOB.21.15	What profit should we have, if we pray to him?’
JOB.21.16	Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand.
JOB.21.16	The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.21.17	“How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out,
JOB.21.17	that their calamity comes on them,
JOB.21.17	that God distributes sorrows in his anger?
JOB.21.18	How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind,
JOB.21.18	as chaff that the storm carries away?
JOB.21.19	You say, ‘God lays up his iniquity for his children.’
JOB.21.19	Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it.
JOB.21.20	Let his own eyes see his destruction.
JOB.21.20	Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For what does he care for his house after him,
JOB.21.21	when the number of his months is cut off?
JOB.21.22	“Shall any teach God knowledge,
JOB.21.22	since he judges those who are high?
JOB.21.23	One dies in his full strength,
JOB.21.23	being wholly at ease and quiet.
JOB.21.24	His pails are full of milk.
JOB.21.24	The marrow of his bones is moistened.
JOB.21.25	Another dies in bitterness of soul,
JOB.21.25	and never tastes of good.
JOB.21.26	They lie down alike in the dust.
JOB.21.26	The worm covers them.
JOB.21.27	“Behold, I know your thoughts,
JOB.21.27	the plans with which you would wrong me.
JOB.21.28	For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince?
JOB.21.28	Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?’
JOB.21.29	Haven’t you asked wayfaring men?
JOB.21.29	Don’t you know their evidences,
JOB.21.30	that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity,
JOB.21.30	That they are led out to the day of wrath?
JOB.21.31	Who will declare his way to his face?
JOB.21.31	Who will repay him what he has done?
JOB.21.32	Yet he will be borne to the grave.
JOB.21.32	Men will keep watch over the tomb.
JOB.21.33	The clods of the valley will be sweet to him.
JOB.21.33	All men will draw after him,
JOB.21.33	as there were innumerable before him.
JOB.21.34	So how can you comfort me with nonsense,
JOB.21.34	because in your answers there remains only falsehood?”
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
JOB.22.2	“Can a man be profitable to God?
JOB.22.2	Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.
JOB.22.3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous?
JOB.22.3	Or does it benefit him that you make your ways perfect?
JOB.22.4	Is it for your piety that he reproves you,
JOB.22.4	that he enters with you into judgement?
JOB.22.5	Isn’t your wickedness great?
JOB.22.5	Neither is there any end to your iniquities.
JOB.22.6	For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing,
JOB.22.6	and stripped the naked of their clothing.
JOB.22.7	You haven’t given water to the weary to drink,
JOB.22.7	and you have withheld bread from the hungry.
JOB.22.8	But as for the mighty man, he had the earth.
JOB.22.8	The honourable man, he lived in it.
JOB.22.9	You have sent widows away empty,
JOB.22.9	and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
JOB.22.10	Therefore snares are around you.
JOB.22.10	Sudden fear troubles you,
JOB.22.11	or darkness, so that you can not see,
JOB.22.11	and floods of waters cover you.
JOB.22.12	“Isn’t God in the heights of heaven?
JOB.22.12	See the height of the stars, how high they are!
JOB.22.13	You say, ‘What does God know?
JOB.22.13	Can he judge through the thick darkness?
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn’t see.
JOB.22.14	He walks on the vault of the sky.’
JOB.22.15	Will you keep the old way,
JOB.22.15	which wicked men have trodden,
JOB.22.16	who were snatched away before their time,
JOB.22.16	whose foundation was poured out as a stream,
JOB.22.17	who said to God, ‘Depart from us;’
JOB.22.17	and, ‘What can the Almighty do for us?’
JOB.22.18	Yet he filled their houses with good things,
JOB.22.18	but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.22.19	The righteous see it, and are glad.
JOB.22.19	The innocent ridicule them,
JOB.22.20	saying, ‘Surely those who rose up against us are cut off.
JOB.22.20	The fire has consumed their remnant.’
JOB.22.21	“Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace.
JOB.22.21	By it, good will come to you.
JOB.22.22	Please receive instruction from his mouth,
JOB.22.22	and lay up his words in your heart.
JOB.22.23	If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up,
JOB.22.23	if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.
JOB.22.24	Lay your treasure in the dust,
JOB.22.24	the gold of Ophir amongst the stones of the brooks.
JOB.22.25	The Almighty will be your treasure,
JOB.22.25	and precious silver to you.
JOB.22.26	For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,
JOB.22.26	and will lift up your face to God.
JOB.22.27	You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you.
JOB.22.27	You will pay your vows.
JOB.22.28	You will also decree a thing, and it will be established to you.
JOB.22.28	Light will shine on your ways.
JOB.22.29	When they cast down, you will say, ‘be lifted up.’
JOB.22.29	He will save the humble person.
JOB.22.30	He will even deliver him who is not innocent.
JOB.22.30	Yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.23.2	“Even today my complaint is rebellious.
JOB.23.2	His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
JOB.23.3	Oh that I knew where I might find him!
JOB.23.3	That I might come even to his seat!
JOB.23.4	I would set my cause in order before him,
JOB.23.4	and fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would know the words which he would answer me,
JOB.23.5	and understand what he would tell me.
JOB.23.6	Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?
JOB.23.6	No, but he would listen to me.
JOB.23.7	There the upright might reason with him,
JOB.23.7	so I should be delivered forever from my judge.
JOB.23.8	“If I go east, he is not there;
JOB.23.8	if west, I can’t find him;
JOB.23.9	He works to the north, but I can’t see him.
JOB.23.9	He turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of him.
JOB.23.10	But he knows the way that I take.
JOB.23.10	When he has tried me, I will come out like gold.
JOB.23.11	My foot has held fast to his steps.
JOB.23.11	I have kept his way, and not turned away.
JOB.23.12	I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips.
JOB.23.12	I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
JOB.23.13	But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?
JOB.23.13	What his soul desires, even that he does.
JOB.23.14	For he performs that which is appointed for me.
JOB.23.14	Many such things are with him.
JOB.23.15	Therefore I am terrified at his presence.
JOB.23.15	When I consider, I am afraid of him.
JOB.23.16	For God has made my heart faint.
JOB.23.16	The Almighty has terrified me.
JOB.23.17	Because I was not cut off before the darkness,
JOB.23.17	neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
JOB.24.1	“Why aren’t times laid up by the Almighty?
JOB.24.1	Why don’t those who know him see his days?
JOB.24.2	There are people who remove the landmarks.
JOB.24.2	They violently take away flocks, and feed them.
JOB.24.3	They drive away the donkey of the fatherless,
JOB.24.3	and they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
JOB.24.4	They turn the needy out of the way.
JOB.24.4	The poor of the earth all hide themselves.
JOB.24.5	Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert,
JOB.24.5	they go out to their work, seeking diligently for food.
JOB.24.5	The wilderness yields them bread for their children.
JOB.24.6	They cut their food in the field.
JOB.24.6	They glean the vineyard of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	They lie all night naked without clothing,
JOB.24.7	and have no covering in the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
JOB.24.8	and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.
JOB.24.9	There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast,
JOB.24.9	and take a pledge of the poor,
JOB.24.10	So that they go around naked without clothing.
JOB.24.10	Being hungry, they carry the sheaves.
JOB.24.11	They make oil within the walls of these men.
JOB.24.11	They tread wine presses, and suffer thirst.
JOB.24.12	From out of the populous city, men groan.
JOB.24.12	The soul of the wounded cries out,
JOB.24.12	yet God doesn’t regard the folly.
JOB.24.13	“These are of those who rebel against the light.
JOB.24.13	They don’t know its ways,
JOB.24.13	nor stay in its paths.
JOB.24.14	The murderer rises with the light.
JOB.24.14	He kills the poor and needy.
JOB.24.14	In the night he is like a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight,
JOB.24.15	saying, ‘No eye will see me.’
JOB.24.15	He disguises his face.
JOB.24.16	In the dark they dig through houses.
JOB.24.16	They shut themselves up in the daytime.
JOB.24.16	They don’t know the light.
JOB.24.17	For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness,
JOB.24.17	for they know the terrors of the thick darkness.
JOB.24.18	“They are foam on the surface of the waters.
JOB.24.18	Their portion is cursed in the earth.
JOB.24.18	They don’t turn into the way of the vineyards.
JOB.24.19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters,
JOB.24.19	so does Sheol
JOB.24.20	The womb will forget him.
JOB.24.20	The worm will feed sweetly on him.
JOB.24.20	He will be no more remembered.
JOB.24.20	Unrighteousness will be broken as a tree.
JOB.24.21	He devours the barren who don’t bear.
JOB.24.21	He shows no kindness to the widow.
JOB.24.22	Yet God preserves the mighty by his power.
JOB.24.22	He rises up who has no assurance of life.
JOB.24.23	God gives them security, and they rest in it.
JOB.24.23	His eyes are on their ways.
JOB.24.24	They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone.
JOB.24.24	Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others,
JOB.24.24	and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.
JOB.24.25	If it isn’t so now, who will prove me a liar,
JOB.24.25	and make my speech worth nothing?”
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
JOB.25.2	“Dominion and fear are with him.
JOB.25.2	He makes peace in his high places.
JOB.25.3	Can his armies be counted?
JOB.25.3	On whom does his light not arise?
JOB.25.4	How then can man be just with God?
JOB.25.4	Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean?
JOB.25.5	Behold, even the moon has no brightness,
JOB.25.5	and the stars are not pure in his sight;
JOB.25.6	How much less man, who is a worm,
JOB.25.6	the son of man, who is a worm!”
JOB.26.1	Then Job answered,
JOB.26.2	“How have you helped him who is without power!
JOB.26.2	How have you saved the arm that has no strength!
JOB.26.3	How have you counselled him who has no wisdom,
JOB.26.3	and plentifully declared sound knowledge!
JOB.26.4	To whom have you uttered words?
JOB.26.4	Whose spirit came out of you?
JOB.26.5	“The departed spirits tremble,
JOB.26.5	those beneath the waters and all that live in them.
JOB.26.6	Sheol
JOB.26.6	and Abaddon
JOB.26.7	He stretches out the north over empty space,
JOB.26.7	and hangs the earth on nothing.
JOB.26.8	He binds up the waters in his thick clouds,
JOB.26.8	and the cloud is not burst under them.
JOB.26.9	He encloses the face of his throne,
JOB.26.9	and spreads his cloud on it.
JOB.26.10	He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters,
JOB.26.10	and to the confines of light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of heaven tremble
JOB.26.11	and are astonished at his rebuke.
JOB.26.12	He stirs up the sea with his power,
JOB.26.12	and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab.
JOB.26.13	By his Spirit the heavens are garnished.
JOB.26.13	His hand has pierced the swift serpent.
JOB.26.14	Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways.
JOB.26.14	How small a whisper do we hear of him!
JOB.26.14	But the thunder of his power who can understand?”
JOB.27.1	Job again took up his parable, and said,
JOB.27.2	“As God lives, who has taken away my right,
JOB.27.2	the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter
JOB.27.3	(for the length of my life is still in me,
JOB.27.3	and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);
JOB.27.4	surely my lips will not speak unrighteousness,
JOB.27.4	neither will my tongue utter deceit.
JOB.27.5	Far be it from me that I should justify you.
JOB.27.5	Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
JOB.27.6	I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go.
JOB.27.6	My heart will not reproach me so long as I live.
JOB.27.7	“Let my enemy be as the wicked.
JOB.27.7	Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.
JOB.27.8	For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?
JOB.27.10	Will he delight himself in the Almighty,
JOB.27.10	and call on God at all times?
JOB.27.11	I will teach you about the hand of God.
JOB.27.11	I will not conceal that which is with the Almighty.
JOB.27.12	Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves;
JOB.27.12	why then have you become altogether vain?
JOB.27.13	“This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
JOB.27.13	the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.
JOB.27.14	If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword.
JOB.27.14	His offspring will not be satisfied with bread.
JOB.27.15	Those who remain of him will be buried in death.
JOB.27.15	His widows will make no lamentation.
JOB.27.16	Though he heap up silver as the dust,
JOB.27.16	and prepare clothing as the clay;
JOB.27.17	he may prepare it, but the just will put it on,
JOB.27.17	and the innocent will divide the silver.
JOB.27.18	He builds his house as the moth,
JOB.27.18	as a booth which the watchman makes.
JOB.27.19	He lies down rich, but he will not do so again.
JOB.27.19	He opens his eyes, and he is not.
JOB.27.20	Terrors overtake him like waters.
JOB.27.20	A storm steals him away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind carries him away, and he departs.
JOB.27.21	It sweeps him out of his place.
JOB.27.22	For it hurls at him, and does not spare,
JOB.27.22	as he flees away from his hand.
JOB.27.23	Men will clap their hands at him,
JOB.27.23	and will hiss him out of his place.
JOB.28.1	“Surely there is a mine for silver,
JOB.28.1	and a place for gold which they refine.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken out of the earth,
JOB.28.2	and copper is smelted out of the ore.
JOB.28.3	Man sets an end to darkness,
JOB.28.3	and searches out, to the furthest bound,
JOB.28.3	the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.
JOB.28.4	He breaks open a shaft away from where people live.
JOB.28.4	They are forgotten by the foot.
JOB.28.4	They hang far from men, they swing back and forth.
JOB.28.5	As for the earth, out of it comes bread.
JOB.28.5	Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.
JOB.28.6	Sapphires come from its rocks.
JOB.28.6	It has dust of gold.
JOB.28.7	That path no bird of prey knows,
JOB.28.7	neither has the falcon’s eye seen it.
JOB.28.8	The proud animals have not trodden it,
JOB.28.8	nor has the fierce lion passed by there.
JOB.28.9	He puts his hand on the flinty rock,
JOB.28.9	and he overturns the mountains by the roots.
JOB.28.10	He cuts out channels amongst the rocks.
JOB.28.10	His eye sees every precious thing.
JOB.28.11	He binds the streams that they don’t trickle.
JOB.28.11	The thing that is hidden he brings out to light.
JOB.28.12	“But where will wisdom be found?
JOB.28.12	Where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.13	Man doesn’t know its price;
JOB.28.13	Neither is it found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The deep says, ‘It isn’t in me.’
JOB.28.14	The sea says, ‘It isn’t with me.’
JOB.28.15	It can’t be gotten for gold,
JOB.28.15	neither will silver be weighed for its price.
JOB.28.16	It can’t be valued with the gold of Ophir,
JOB.28.16	with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
JOB.28.17	Gold and glass can’t equal it,
JOB.28.17	neither will it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
JOB.28.18	No mention will be made of coral or of crystal.
JOB.28.18	Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies.
JOB.28.19	The topaz of Ethiopia will not equal it,
JOB.28.19	nor will it be valued with pure gold.
JOB.28.20	Where then does wisdom come from?
JOB.28.20	Where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.21	Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living,
JOB.28.21	and kept close from the birds of the sky.
JOB.28.22	Destruction and Death say,
JOB.28.22	‘We have heard a rumour of it with our ears.’
JOB.28.23	“God understands its way,
JOB.28.23	and he knows its place.
JOB.28.24	For he looks to the ends of the earth,
JOB.28.24	and sees under the whole sky.
JOB.28.25	He establishes the force of the wind.
JOB.28.25	Yes, he measures out the waters by measure.
JOB.28.26	When he made a decree for the rain,
JOB.28.26	and a way for the lightning of the thunder,
JOB.28.27	then he saw it, and declared it.
JOB.28.27	He established it, yes, and searched it out.
JOB.28.28	To man he said,
JOB.28.28	‘Behold, the fear of the Lord,
JOB.28.28	To depart from evil is understanding.’”
JOB.29.1	Job again took up his parable, and said,
JOB.29.2	“Oh that I were as in the months of old,
JOB.29.2	as in the days when God watched over me;
JOB.29.3	when his lamp shone on my head,
JOB.29.3	and by his light I walked through darkness,
JOB.29.4	as I was in my prime,
JOB.29.4	when the friendship of God was in my tent,
JOB.29.5	when the Almighty was yet with me,
JOB.29.5	and my children were around me,
JOB.29.6	when my steps were washed with butter,
JOB.29.6	and the rock poured out streams of oil for me,
JOB.29.7	when I went out to the city gate,
JOB.29.7	when I prepared my seat in the street.
JOB.29.8	The young men saw me and hid themselves.
JOB.29.8	The aged rose up and stood.
JOB.29.9	The princes refrained from talking,
JOB.29.9	and laid their hand on their mouth.
JOB.29.10	The voice of the nobles was hushed,
JOB.29.10	and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.
JOB.29.11	For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;
JOB.29.11	and when the eye saw me, it commended me:
JOB.29.12	Because I delivered the poor who cried,
JOB.29.12	and the fatherless also, who had no one to help him,
JOB.29.13	the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,
JOB.29.13	and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.
JOB.29.14	My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind,
JOB.29.15	and feet to the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the needy.
JOB.29.16	I researched the cause of him whom I didn’t know.
JOB.29.17	I broke the jaws of the unrighteous
JOB.29.17	and plucked the prey out of his teeth.
JOB.29.18	Then I said, ‘I will die in my own house,
JOB.29.18	I will count my days as the sand.
JOB.29.19	My root is spread out to the waters.
JOB.29.19	The dew lies all night on my branch.
JOB.29.20	My glory is fresh in me.
JOB.29.20	My bow is renewed in my hand.’
JOB.29.21	“Men listened to me, waited,
JOB.29.21	and kept silence for my counsel.
JOB.29.22	After my words they didn’t speak again.
JOB.29.22	My speech fell on them.
JOB.29.23	They waited for me as for the rain.
JOB.29.23	Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.
JOB.29.24	I smiled on them when they had no confidence.
JOB.29.24	They didn’t reject the light of my face.
JOB.29.25	I chose out their way, and sat as chief.
JOB.29.25	I lived as a king in the army,
JOB.29.25	as one who comforts the mourners.
JOB.30.1	“But now those who are younger than I have me in derision,
JOB.30.1	whose fathers I considered unworthy to put with my sheep dogs.
JOB.30.2	Of what use is the strength of their hands to me,
JOB.30.2	men in whom ripe age has perished?
JOB.30.3	They are gaunt from lack and famine.
JOB.30.3	They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation.
JOB.30.4	They pluck salt herbs by the bushes.
JOB.30.4	The roots of the broom tree are their food.
JOB.30.5	They are driven out from amongst men.
JOB.30.5	They cry after them as after a thief;
JOB.30.6	So that they dwell in frightful valleys,
JOB.30.6	and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.
JOB.30.7	They bray amongst the bushes.
JOB.30.7	They are gathered together under the nettles.
JOB.30.8	They are children of fools, yes, children of wicked men.
JOB.30.8	They were flogged out of the land.
JOB.30.9	“Now I have become their song.
JOB.30.9	Yes, I am a byword to them.
JOB.30.10	They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,
JOB.30.10	and don’t hesitate to spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me;
JOB.30.11	and they have thrown off restraint before me.
JOB.30.12	On my right hand rise the rabble.
JOB.30.12	They thrust aside my feet,
JOB.30.12	They cast up against me their ways of destruction.
JOB.30.13	They mar my path.
JOB.30.13	They promote my destruction
JOB.30.13	without anyone’s help.
JOB.30.14	As through a wide breach they come.
JOB.30.14	They roll themselves in amid the ruin.
JOB.30.15	Terrors have turned on me.
JOB.30.15	They chase my honour as the wind.
JOB.30.15	My welfare has passed away as a cloud.
JOB.30.16	“Now my soul is poured out within me.
JOB.30.16	Days of affliction have taken hold of me.
JOB.30.17	In the night season my bones are pierced in me,
JOB.30.17	and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.
JOB.30.18	My garment is disfigured by great force.
JOB.30.18	It binds me about as the collar of my tunic.
JOB.30.19	He has cast me into the mire.
JOB.30.19	I have become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	I cry to you, and you do not answer me.
JOB.30.20	I stand up, and you gaze at me.
JOB.30.21	You have turned to be cruel to me.
JOB.30.21	With the might of your hand you persecute me.
JOB.30.22	You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it.
JOB.30.22	You dissolve me in the storm.
JOB.30.23	For I know that you will bring me to death,
JOB.30.23	to the house appointed for all living.
JOB.30.24	“However doesn’t one stretch out a hand in his fall?
JOB.30.24	Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?
JOB.30.25	Didn’t I weep for him who was in trouble?
JOB.30.25	Wasn’t my soul grieved for the needy?
JOB.30.26	When I looked for good, then evil came.
JOB.30.26	When I waited for light, darkness came.
JOB.30.27	My heart is troubled, and doesn’t rest.
JOB.30.27	Days of affliction have come on me.
JOB.30.28	I go mourning without the sun.
JOB.30.28	I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.
JOB.30.29	I am a brother to jackals,
JOB.30.29	and a companion to ostriches.
JOB.30.30	My skin grows black and peels from me.
JOB.30.30	My bones are burnt with heat.
JOB.30.31	Therefore my harp has turned to mourning,
JOB.30.31	and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.
JOB.31.1	“I made a covenant with my eyes,
JOB.31.1	how then should I look lustfully at a young woman?
JOB.31.2	For what is the portion from God above,
JOB.31.2	and the heritage from the Almighty on high?
JOB.31.3	Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,
JOB.31.3	and disaster to the workers of iniquity?
JOB.31.4	Doesn’t he see my ways,
JOB.31.4	and count all my steps?
JOB.31.5	“If I have walked with falsehood,
JOB.31.5	and my foot has hurried to deceit
JOB.31.6	(let me be weighed in an even balance,
JOB.31.6	that God may know my integrity);
JOB.31.7	if my step has turned out of the way,
JOB.31.7	if my heart walked after my eyes,
JOB.31.7	if any defilement has stuck to my hands,
JOB.31.8	then let me sow, and let another eat.
JOB.31.8	Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.
JOB.31.9	“If my heart has been enticed to a woman,
JOB.31.9	and I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door,
JOB.31.10	then let my wife grind for another,
JOB.31.10	and let others sleep with her.
JOB.31.11	For that would be a heinous crime.
JOB.31.11	Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
JOB.31.12	for it is a fire that consumes to destruction,
JOB.31.12	and would root out all my increase.
JOB.31.13	“If I have despised the cause of my male servant
JOB.31.13	or of my female servant,
JOB.31.13	when they contended with me,
JOB.31.14	what then will I do when God rises up?
JOB.31.14	When he visits, what will I answer him?
JOB.31.15	Didn’t he who made me in the womb make him?
JOB.31.15	Didn’t one fashion us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	“If I have withheld the poor from their desire,
JOB.31.16	or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
JOB.31.17	or have eaten my morsel alone,
JOB.31.17	and the fatherless has not eaten of it
JOB.31.18	(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,
JOB.31.18	I have guided her from my mother’s womb);
JOB.31.19	if I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
JOB.31.19	or that the needy had no covering;
JOB.31.20	if his heart hasn’t blessed me,
JOB.31.20	if he hasn’t been warmed with my sheep’s fleece;
JOB.31.21	if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
JOB.31.21	because I saw my help in the gate,
JOB.31.22	then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade,
JOB.31.22	and my arm be broken from the bone.
JOB.31.23	For calamity from God is a terror to me.
JOB.31.23	Because of his majesty, I can do nothing.
JOB.31.24	“If I have made gold my hope,
JOB.31.24	and have said to the fine gold, ‘You are my confidence;’
JOB.31.25	If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,
JOB.31.25	and because my hand had gotten much;
JOB.31.26	if I have seen the sun when it shined,
JOB.31.26	or the moon moving in splendour,
JOB.31.27	and my heart has been secretly enticed,
JOB.31.27	and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,
JOB.31.28	this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
JOB.31.28	for I should have denied the God who is above.
JOB.31.29	“If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,
JOB.31.29	or lifted up myself when evil found him
JOB.31.30	(yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sin
JOB.31.30	by asking his life with a curse);
JOB.31.31	if the men of my tent have not said,
JOB.31.31	‘Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?’
JOB.31.32	(the foreigner has not camped in the street,
JOB.31.32	but I have opened my doors to the traveller);
JOB.31.33	if like Adam I have covered my transgressions,
JOB.31.33	by hiding my iniquity in my heart,
JOB.31.34	because I feared the great multitude,
JOB.31.34	and the contempt of families terrified me,
JOB.31.34	so that I kept silence, and didn’t go out of the door—
JOB.31.35	oh that I had one to hear me!
JOB.31.35	Behold, here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!
JOB.31.35	Let the accuser write my indictment!
JOB.31.36	Surely I would carry it on my shoulder;
JOB.31.36	and I would bind it to me as a crown.
JOB.31.37	I would declare to him the number of my steps.
JOB.31.37	I would go near to him like a prince.
JOB.31.38	If my land cries out against me,
JOB.31.38	and its furrows weep together;
JOB.31.39	if I have eaten its fruits without money,
JOB.31.39	or have caused its owners to lose their life,
JOB.31.40	let briers grow instead of wheat,
JOB.31.40	and stinkweed instead of barley.”
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
JOB.32.2	Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God. 
JOB.32.3	Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were elder than he. 
JOB.32.5	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.
JOB.32.6	Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered,
JOB.32.6	“I am young, and you are very old;
JOB.32.6	Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion.
JOB.32.7	I said, ‘Days should speak,
JOB.32.7	and multitude of years should teach wisdom.’
JOB.32.8	But there is a spirit in man,
JOB.32.8	and the Spirit
JOB.32.9	It is not the great who are wise,
JOB.32.9	nor the aged who understand justice.
JOB.32.10	Therefore I said, ‘Listen to me;
JOB.32.10	I also will show my opinion.’
JOB.32.11	“Behold, I waited for your words,
JOB.32.11	and I listened for your reasoning,
JOB.32.11	while you searched out what to say.
JOB.32.12	Yes, I gave you my full attention,
JOB.32.12	but there was no one who convinced Job,
JOB.32.12	or who answered his words, amongst you.
JOB.32.13	Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom.
JOB.32.13	God may refute him, not man;’
JOB.32.14	for he has not directed his words against me;
JOB.32.14	neither will I answer him with your speeches.
JOB.32.15	“They are amazed. They answer no more.
JOB.32.15	They don’t have a word to say.
JOB.32.16	Shall I wait, because they don’t speak,
JOB.32.16	because they stand still, and answer no more?
JOB.32.17	I also will answer my part,
JOB.32.17	and I also will show my opinion.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of words.
JOB.32.18	The spirit within me constrains me.
JOB.32.19	Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent;
JOB.32.19	like new wineskins it is ready to burst.
JOB.32.20	I will speak, that I may be refreshed.
JOB.32.20	I will open my lips and answer.
JOB.32.21	Please don’t let me respect any man’s person,
JOB.32.21	neither will I give flattering titles to any man.
JOB.32.22	For I don’t know how to give flattering titles,
JOB.32.22	or else my Maker would soon take me away.
JOB.33.1	“However, Job, please hear my speech,
JOB.33.1	and listen to all my words.
JOB.33.2	See now, I have opened my mouth.
JOB.33.2	My tongue has spoken in my mouth.
JOB.33.3	My words will utter the uprightness of my heart.
JOB.33.3	That which my lips know they will speak sincerely.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God has made me,
JOB.33.4	and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
JOB.33.5	If you can, answer me.
JOB.33.5	Set your words in order before me, and stand up.
JOB.33.6	Behold, I am towards God even as you are.
JOB.33.6	I am also formed out of the clay.
JOB.33.7	Behold, my terror will not make you afraid,
JOB.33.7	neither will my pressure be heavy on you.
JOB.33.8	“Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
JOB.33.8	I have heard the voice of your words, saying,
JOB.33.9	‘I am clean, without disobedience.
JOB.33.9	I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.
JOB.33.10	Behold, he finds occasions against me.
JOB.33.10	He counts me for his enemy.
JOB.33.11	He puts my feet in the stocks.
JOB.33.11	He marks all my paths.’
JOB.33.12	“Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just,
JOB.33.12	for God is greater than man.
JOB.33.13	Why do you strive against him,
JOB.33.13	because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?
JOB.33.14	For God speaks once,
JOB.33.14	yes twice, though man pays no attention.
JOB.33.15	In a dream, in a vision of the night,
JOB.33.15	when deep sleep falls on men,
JOB.33.15	in slumbering on the bed;
JOB.33.16	Then he opens the ears of men,
JOB.33.16	and seals their instruction,
JOB.33.17	that he may withdraw man from his purpose,
JOB.33.17	and hide pride from man.
JOB.33.18	He keeps back his soul from the pit,
JOB.33.18	and his life from perishing by the sword.
JOB.33.19	“He is chastened also with pain on his bed,
JOB.33.19	with continual strife in his bones,
JOB.33.20	so that his life abhors bread,
JOB.33.20	and his soul dainty food.
JOB.33.21	His flesh is so consumed away that it can’t be seen.
JOB.33.21	His bones that were not seen stick out.
JOB.33.22	Yes, his soul draws near to the pit,
JOB.33.22	and his life to the destroyers.
JOB.33.23	“If there is beside him an angel,
JOB.33.23	an interpreter, one amongst a thousand,
JOB.33.23	to show to man what is right for him;
JOB.33.24	then God is gracious to him, and says,
JOB.33.24	‘Deliver him from going down to the pit,
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom.’
JOB.33.25	His flesh will be fresher than a child’s.
JOB.33.25	He returns to the days of his youth.
JOB.33.26	He prays to God, and he is favourable to him,
JOB.33.26	so that he sees his face with joy.
JOB.33.26	He restores to man his righteousness.
JOB.33.27	He sings before men, and says,
JOB.33.27	‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,
JOB.33.27	and it didn’t profit me.
JOB.33.28	He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit.
JOB.33.28	My life will see the light.’
JOB.33.29	“Behold, God does all these things,
JOB.33.29	twice, yes three times, with a man,
JOB.33.30	to bring back his soul from the pit,
JOB.33.30	that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
JOB.33.31	Mark well, Job, and listen to me.
JOB.33.31	Hold your peace, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	If you have anything to say, answer me.
JOB.33.32	Speak, for I desire to justify you.
JOB.33.33	If not, listen to me.
JOB.33.33	Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”
JOB.34.1	Moreover Elihu answered,
JOB.34.2	“Hear my words, you wise men.
JOB.34.2	Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.
JOB.34.3	For the ear tries words,
JOB.34.3	as the palate tastes food.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose for us that which is right.
JOB.34.4	Let us know amongst ourselves what is good.
JOB.34.5	For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,
JOB.34.5	God has taken away my right:
JOB.34.6	Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar.
JOB.34.6	My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’
JOB.34.7	What man is like Job,
JOB.34.7	who drinks scorn like water,
JOB.34.8	Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,
JOB.34.8	and walks with wicked men?
JOB.34.9	For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing
JOB.34.9	that he should delight himself with God.’
JOB.34.10	“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:
JOB.34.10	far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,
JOB.34.10	from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
JOB.34.11	For the work of a man he will render to him,
JOB.34.11	and cause every man to find according to his ways.
JOB.34.12	Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,
JOB.34.12	neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
JOB.34.13	Who put him in charge of the earth?
JOB.34.13	Or who has appointed him over the whole world?
JOB.34.14	If he set his heart on himself,
JOB.34.14	if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,
JOB.34.15	all flesh would perish together,
JOB.34.15	and man would turn again to dust.
JOB.34.16	“If now you have understanding, hear this.
JOB.34.16	Listen to the voice of my words.
JOB.34.17	Should even one who hates justice govern?
JOB.34.17	Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?—
JOB.34.18	Who says to a king, ‘Vile!’
JOB.34.18	or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?
JOB.34.19	He doesn’t respect the persons of princes,
JOB.34.19	nor respect the rich more than the poor;
JOB.34.19	for they all are the work of his hands.
JOB.34.20	In a moment they die, even at midnight.
JOB.34.20	The people are shaken and pass away.
JOB.34.20	The mighty are taken away without a hand.
JOB.34.21	“For his eyes are on the ways of a man.
JOB.34.21	He sees all his goings.
JOB.34.22	There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,
JOB.34.22	where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
JOB.34.23	For he doesn’t need to consider a man further,
JOB.34.23	that he should go before God in judgement.
JOB.34.24	He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out,
JOB.34.24	and sets others in their place.
JOB.34.25	Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.
JOB.34.25	He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
JOB.34.26	He strikes them as wicked men
JOB.34.26	in the open sight of others;
JOB.34.27	because they turned away from following him,
JOB.34.27	and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,
JOB.34.28	so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.
JOB.34.28	He heard the cry of the afflicted.
JOB.34.29	When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?
JOB.34.29	When he hides his face, who then can see him?
JOB.34.29	He is over a nation or a man alike,
JOB.34.30	that the godless man may not reign,
JOB.34.30	that there be no one to ensnare the people.
JOB.34.31	“For has any said to God,
JOB.34.31	‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.
JOB.34.32	Teach me that which I don’t see.
JOB.34.32	If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?
JOB.34.33	Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?
JOB.34.33	For you must choose, and not I.
JOB.34.33	Therefore speak what you know.
JOB.34.34	Men of understanding will tell me,
JOB.34.34	yes, every wise man who hears me:
JOB.34.35	‘Job speaks without knowledge.
JOB.34.35	His words are without wisdom.’
JOB.34.36	I wish that Job were tried to the end,
JOB.34.36	because of his answering like wicked men.
JOB.34.37	For he adds rebellion to his sin.
JOB.34.37	He claps his hands amongst us,
JOB.34.37	and multiplies his words against God.”
JOB.35.1	Moreover Elihu answered,
JOB.35.2	“Do you think this to be your right,
JOB.35.2	or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’
JOB.35.3	that you ask, ‘What advantage will it be to you?
JOB.35.3	What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?’
JOB.35.4	I will answer you,
JOB.35.4	and your companions with you.
JOB.35.5	Look to the skies, and see.
JOB.35.5	See the skies, which are higher than you.
JOB.35.6	If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him?
JOB.35.6	If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
JOB.35.7	If you are righteous, what do you give him?
JOB.35.7	Or what does he receive from your hand?
JOB.35.8	Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are,
JOB.35.8	and your righteousness may profit a son of man.
JOB.35.9	“By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out.
JOB.35.9	They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
JOB.35.10	But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,
JOB.35.10	who gives songs in the night,
JOB.35.11	who teaches us more than the animals of the earth,
JOB.35.11	and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’
JOB.35.12	There they cry, but no one answers,
JOB.35.12	because of the pride of evil men.
JOB.35.13	Surely God will not hear an empty cry,
JOB.35.13	neither will the Almighty regard it.
JOB.35.14	How much less when you say you don’t see him.
JOB.35.14	The cause is before him, and you wait for him!
JOB.35.15	But now, because he has not visited in his anger,
JOB.35.15	neither does he greatly regard arrogance,
JOB.35.16	therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk,
JOB.35.16	and he multiplies words without knowledge.”
JOB.36.1	Elihu also continued, and said,
JOB.36.2	“Bear with me a little, and I will show you;
JOB.36.2	for I still have something to say on God’s behalf.
JOB.36.3	I will get my knowledge from afar,
JOB.36.3	and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	For truly my words are not false.
JOB.36.4	One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
JOB.36.5	“Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone.
JOB.36.5	He is mighty in strength of understanding.
JOB.36.6	He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked,
JOB.36.6	but gives justice to the afflicted.
JOB.36.7	He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous,
JOB.36.7	but with kings on the throne,
JOB.36.7	he sets them forever, and they are exalted.
JOB.36.8	If they are bound in fetters,
JOB.36.8	and are taken in the cords of afflictions,
JOB.36.9	then he shows them their work,
JOB.36.9	and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
JOB.36.10	He also opens their ears to instruction,
JOB.36.10	and commands that they return from iniquity.
JOB.36.11	If they listen and serve him,
JOB.36.11	they will spend their days in prosperity,
JOB.36.11	and their years in pleasures.
JOB.36.12	But if they don’t listen, they will perish by the sword;
JOB.36.12	they will die without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	“But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.
JOB.36.13	They don’t cry for help when he binds them.
JOB.36.14	They die in youth.
JOB.36.14	Their life perishes amongst the unclean.
JOB.36.15	He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,
JOB.36.15	and opens their ear in oppression.
JOB.36.16	Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,
JOB.36.16	into a wide place, where there is no restriction.
JOB.36.16	That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.
JOB.36.17	“But you are full of the judgement of the wicked.
JOB.36.17	Judgement and justice take hold of you.
JOB.36.18	Don’t let riches entice you to wrath,
JOB.36.18	neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.
JOB.36.19	Would your wealth sustain you in distress,
JOB.36.19	or all the might of your strength?
JOB.36.20	Don’t desire the night,
JOB.36.20	when people are cut off in their place.
JOB.36.21	Take heed, don’t regard iniquity;
JOB.36.21	for you have chosen this rather than affliction.
JOB.36.22	Behold, God is exalted in his power.
JOB.36.22	Who is a teacher like him?
JOB.36.23	Who has prescribed his way for him?
JOB.36.23	Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness?’
JOB.36.24	“Remember that you magnify his work,
JOB.36.24	about which men have sung.
JOB.36.25	All men have looked on it.
JOB.36.25	Man sees it afar off.
JOB.36.26	Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him.
JOB.36.26	The number of his years is unsearchable.
JOB.36.27	For he draws up the drops of water,
JOB.36.27	which distill in rain from his vapour,
JOB.36.28	which the skies pour down
JOB.36.28	and which drop on man abundantly.
JOB.36.29	Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds,
JOB.36.29	and the thunderings of his pavilion?
JOB.36.30	Behold, he spreads his light around him.
JOB.36.30	He covers the bottom of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For by these he judges the people.
JOB.36.31	He gives food in abundance.
JOB.36.32	He covers his hands with the lightning,
JOB.36.32	and commands it to strike the mark.
JOB.36.33	Its noise tells about him,
JOB.36.33	and the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up.
JOB.37.1	“Yes, at this my heart trembles,
JOB.37.1	and is moved out of its place.
JOB.37.2	Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,
JOB.37.2	the sound that goes out of his mouth.
JOB.37.3	He sends it out under the whole sky,
JOB.37.3	and his lightning to the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After it a voice roars.
JOB.37.4	He thunders with the voice of his majesty.
JOB.37.4	He doesn’t hold back anything when his voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God thunders marvellously with his voice.
JOB.37.5	He does great things, which we can’t comprehend.
JOB.37.6	For he says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’
JOB.37.6	likewise to the shower of rain,
JOB.37.6	and to the showers of his mighty rain.
JOB.37.7	He seals up the hand of every man,
JOB.37.7	that all men whom he has made may know it.
JOB.37.8	Then the animals take cover,
JOB.37.8	and remain in their dens.
JOB.37.9	Out of its room comes the storm,
JOB.37.9	and cold out of the north.
JOB.37.10	By the breath of God, ice is given,
JOB.37.10	and the width of the waters is frozen.
JOB.37.11	Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture.
JOB.37.11	He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning.
JOB.37.12	It is turned around by his guidance,
JOB.37.12	that they may do whatever he commands them
JOB.37.12	on the surface of the habitable world,
JOB.37.13	Whether it is for correction, or for his land,
JOB.37.13	or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come.
JOB.37.14	“Listen to this, Job.
JOB.37.14	Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God controls them,
JOB.37.15	and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?
JOB.37.16	Do you know the workings of the clouds,
JOB.37.16	the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
JOB.37.17	You whose clothing is warm,
JOB.37.17	when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?
JOB.37.18	Can you, with him, spread out the sky,
JOB.37.18	which is strong as a cast metal mirror?
JOB.37.19	Teach us what we will tell him,
JOB.37.19	for we can’t make our case by reason of darkness.
JOB.37.20	Will it be told him that I would speak?
JOB.37.20	Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
JOB.37.21	Now men don’t see the light which is bright in the skies,
JOB.37.21	but the wind passes, and clears them.
JOB.37.22	Out of the north comes golden splendour.
JOB.37.22	With God is awesome majesty.
JOB.37.23	We can’t reach the Almighty.
JOB.37.23	He is exalted in power.
JOB.37.23	In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress.
JOB.37.24	Therefore men revere him.
JOB.37.24	He doesn’t regard any who are wise of heart.”
JOB.38.1	Then the 
JOB.38.2	“Who is this who darkens counsel
JOB.38.2	by words without knowledge?
JOB.38.3	Brace yourself like a man,
JOB.38.3	for I will question you, then you answer me!
JOB.38.4	“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
JOB.38.4	Declare, if you have understanding.
JOB.38.5	Who determined its measures, if you know?
JOB.38.5	Or who stretched the line on it?
JOB.38.6	What were its foundations fastened on?
JOB.38.6	Or who laid its cornerstone,
JOB.38.7	when the morning stars sang together,
JOB.38.7	and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
JOB.38.8	“Or who shut up the sea with doors,
JOB.38.8	when it broke out of the womb,
JOB.38.9	when I made clouds its garment,
JOB.38.9	and wrapped it in thick darkness,
JOB.38.10	marked out for it my bound,
JOB.38.10	set bars and doors,
JOB.38.11	and said, ‘You may come here, but no further.
JOB.38.11	Your proud waves shall be stopped here’?
JOB.38.12	“Have you commanded the morning in your days,
JOB.38.12	and caused the dawn to know its place,
JOB.38.13	that it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
JOB.38.13	and shake the wicked out of it?
JOB.38.14	It is changed as clay under the seal,
JOB.38.14	and presented as a garment.
JOB.38.15	From the wicked, their light is withheld.
JOB.38.15	The high arm is broken.
JOB.38.16	“Have you entered into the springs of the sea?
JOB.38.16	Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been revealed to you?
JOB.38.17	Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
JOB.38.18	Have you comprehended the earth in its width?
JOB.38.18	Declare, if you know it all.
JOB.38.19	“What is the way to the dwelling of light?
JOB.38.19	As for darkness, where is its place,
JOB.38.20	that you should take it to its bound,
JOB.38.20	that you should discern the paths to its house?
JOB.38.21	Surely you know, for you were born then,
JOB.38.21	and the number of your days is great!
JOB.38.22	Have you entered the treasuries of the snow,
JOB.38.22	or have you seen the treasures of the hail,
JOB.38.23	which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
JOB.38.23	against the day of battle and war?
JOB.38.24	By what way is the lightning distributed,
JOB.38.24	or the east wind scattered on the earth?
JOB.38.25	Who has cut a channel for the flood water,
JOB.38.25	or the path for the thunder storm,
JOB.38.26	to cause it to rain on a land where there is no man,
JOB.38.26	on the wilderness, in which there is no man,
JOB.38.27	to satisfy the waste and desolate ground,
JOB.38.27	to cause the tender grass to grow?
JOB.38.28	Does the rain have a father?
JOB.38.28	Or who fathers the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	Whose womb did the ice come out of?
JOB.38.29	Who has given birth to the grey frost of the sky?
JOB.38.30	The waters become hard like stone,
JOB.38.30	when the surface of the deep is frozen.
JOB.38.31	“Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades,
JOB.38.31	or loosen the cords of Orion?
JOB.38.32	Can you lead the constellations out in their season?
JOB.38.32	Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?
JOB.38.33	Do you know the laws of the heavens?
JOB.38.33	Can you establish its dominion over the earth?
JOB.38.34	“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,
JOB.38.34	That abundance of waters may cover you?
JOB.38.35	Can you send out lightnings, that they may go?
JOB.38.35	Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?
JOB.38.36	Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?
JOB.38.36	Or who has given understanding to the mind?
JOB.38.37	Who can count the clouds by wisdom?
JOB.38.37	Or who can pour out the containers of the sky,
JOB.38.38	when the dust runs into a mass,
JOB.38.38	and the clods of earth stick together?
JOB.38.39	“Can you hunt the prey for the lioness,
JOB.38.39	or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
JOB.38.40	when they crouch in their dens,
JOB.38.40	and lie in wait in the thicket?
JOB.38.41	Who provides for the raven his prey,
JOB.38.41	when his young ones cry to God,
JOB.38.41	and wander for lack of food?
JOB.39.1	“Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth?
JOB.39.1	Do you watch when the doe bears fawns?
JOB.39.2	Can you count the months that they fulfil?
JOB.39.2	Or do you know the time when they give birth?
JOB.39.3	They bow themselves. They bear their young.
JOB.39.3	They end their labour pains.
JOB.39.4	Their young ones become strong.
JOB.39.4	They grow up in the open field.
JOB.39.4	They go out, and don’t return again.
JOB.39.5	“Who has set the wild donkey free?
JOB.39.5	Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey,
JOB.39.6	whose home I have made the wilderness,
JOB.39.6	and the salt land his dwelling place?
JOB.39.7	He scorns the tumult of the city,
JOB.39.7	neither does he hear the shouting of the driver.
JOB.39.8	The range of the mountains is his pasture,
JOB.39.8	He searches after every green thing.
JOB.39.9	“Will the wild ox be content to serve you?
JOB.39.9	Or will he stay by your feeding trough?
JOB.39.10	Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness?
JOB.39.10	Or will he till the valleys after you?
JOB.39.11	Will you trust him, because his strength is great?
JOB.39.11	Or will you leave to him your labour?
JOB.39.12	Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed,
JOB.39.12	and gather the grain of your threshing floor?
JOB.39.13	“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;
JOB.39.13	but are they the feathers and plumage of love?
JOB.39.14	For she leaves her eggs on the earth,
JOB.39.14	warms them in the dust,
JOB.39.15	and forgets that the foot may crush them,
JOB.39.15	or that the wild animal may trample them.
JOB.39.16	She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers.
JOB.39.16	Though her labour is in vain, she is without fear,
JOB.39.17	because God has deprived her of wisdom,
JOB.39.17	neither has he imparted to her understanding.
JOB.39.18	When she lifts up herself on high,
JOB.39.18	she scorns the horse and his rider.
JOB.39.19	“Have you given the horse might?
JOB.39.19	Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?
JOB.39.20	Have you made him to leap as a locust?
JOB.39.20	The glory of his snorting is awesome.
JOB.39.21	He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength.
JOB.39.21	He goes out to meet the armed men.
JOB.39.22	He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed,
JOB.39.22	neither does he turn back from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The quiver rattles against him,
JOB.39.23	the flashing spear and the javelin.
JOB.39.24	He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage,
JOB.39.24	neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
JOB.39.25	As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, ‘Aha!’
JOB.39.25	He smells the battle afar off,
JOB.39.25	the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
JOB.39.26	“Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars,
JOB.39.26	and stretches her wings towards the south?
JOB.39.27	Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up,
JOB.39.27	and makes his nest on high?
JOB.39.28	On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home,
JOB.39.28	on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.
JOB.39.29	From there he spies out the prey.
JOB.39.29	His eyes see it afar off.
JOB.39.30	His young ones also suck up blood.
JOB.39.30	Where the slain are, there he is.”
JOB.40.1	Moreover the 
JOB.40.2	“Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty?
JOB.40.2	He who argues with God, let him answer it.”
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the 
JOB.40.4	“Behold, I am of small account. What will I answer you?
JOB.40.4	I lay my hand on my mouth.
JOB.40.5	I have spoken once, and I will not answer;
JOB.40.5	Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”
JOB.40.6	Then the 
JOB.40.7	“Now brace yourself like a man.
JOB.40.7	I will question you, and you will answer me.
JOB.40.8	Will you even annul my judgement?
JOB.40.8	Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?
JOB.40.9	Or do you have an arm like God?
JOB.40.9	Can you thunder with a voice like him?
JOB.40.10	“Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity.
JOB.40.10	Array yourself with honour and majesty.
JOB.40.11	Pour out the fury of your anger.
JOB.40.11	Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.
JOB.40.12	Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him.
JOB.40.12	Crush the wicked in their place.
JOB.40.13	Hide them in the dust together.
JOB.40.13	Bind their faces in the hidden place.
JOB.40.14	Then I will also admit to you
JOB.40.14	that your own right hand can save you.
JOB.40.15	“See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you.
JOB.40.15	He eats grass as an ox.
JOB.40.16	Look now, his strength is in his thighs.
JOB.40.16	His force is in the muscles of his belly.
JOB.40.17	He moves his tail like a cedar.
JOB.40.17	The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
JOB.40.18	His bones are like tubes of bronze.
JOB.40.18	His limbs are like bars of iron.
JOB.40.19	He is the chief of the ways of God.
JOB.40.19	He who made him gives him his sword.
JOB.40.20	Surely the mountains produce food for him,
JOB.40.20	where all the animals of the field play.
JOB.40.21	He lies under the lotus trees,
JOB.40.21	in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.
JOB.40.22	The lotuses cover him with their shade.
JOB.40.22	The willows of the brook surround him.
JOB.40.23	Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble.
JOB.40.23	He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.
JOB.40.24	Shall any take him when he is on the watch,
JOB.40.24	or pierce through his nose with a snare?
JOB.41.1	“Can you draw out Leviathan
JOB.41.1	or press down his tongue with a cord?
JOB.41.2	Can you put a rope into his nose,
JOB.41.2	or pierce his jaw through with a hook?
JOB.41.3	Will he make many petitions to you,
JOB.41.3	or will he speak soft words to you?
JOB.41.4	Will he make a covenant with you,
JOB.41.4	that you should take him for a servant forever?
JOB.41.5	Will you play with him as with a bird?
JOB.41.5	Or will you bind him for your girls?
JOB.41.6	Will traders barter for him?
JOB.41.6	Will they part him amongst the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Can you fill his skin with barbed irons,
JOB.41.7	or his head with fish spears?
JOB.41.8	Lay your hand on him.
JOB.41.8	Remember the battle, and do so no more.
JOB.41.9	Behold, the hope of him is in vain.
JOB.41.9	Won’t one be cast down even at the sight of him?
JOB.41.10	None is so fierce that he dare stir him up.
JOB.41.10	Who then is he who can stand before me?
JOB.41.11	Who has first given to me, that I should repay him?
JOB.41.11	Everything under the heavens is mine.
JOB.41.12	“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,
JOB.41.12	nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.
JOB.41.13	Who can strip off his outer garment?
JOB.41.13	Who will come within his jaws?
JOB.41.14	Who can open the doors of his face?
JOB.41.14	Around his teeth is terror.
JOB.41.15	Strong scales are his pride,
JOB.41.15	shut up together with a close seal.
JOB.41.16	One is so near to another,
JOB.41.16	that no air can come between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined to one another.
JOB.41.17	They stick together, so that they can’t be pulled apart.
JOB.41.18	His sneezing flashes out light.
JOB.41.18	His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
JOB.41.19	Out of his mouth go burning torches.
JOB.41.19	Sparks of fire leap out.
JOB.41.20	Out of his nostrils a smoke goes,
JOB.41.20	as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.
JOB.41.21	His breath kindles coals.
JOB.41.21	A flame goes out of his mouth.
JOB.41.22	There is strength in his neck.
JOB.41.22	Terror dances before him.
JOB.41.23	The flakes of his flesh are joined together.
JOB.41.23	They are firm on him.
JOB.41.23	They can’t be moved.
JOB.41.24	His heart is as firm as a stone,
JOB.41.24	yes, firm as the lower millstone.
JOB.41.25	When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid.
JOB.41.25	They retreat before his thrashing.
JOB.41.26	If one attacks him with the sword, it can’t prevail;
JOB.41.26	nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.
JOB.41.27	He counts iron as straw;
JOB.41.27	and bronze as rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	The arrow can’t make him flee.
JOB.41.28	Sling stones are like chaff to him.
JOB.41.29	Clubs are counted as stubble.
JOB.41.29	He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.
JOB.41.30	His undersides are like sharp potsherds,
JOB.41.30	leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.
JOB.41.31	He makes the deep to boil like a pot.
JOB.41.31	He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
JOB.41.32	He makes a path shine after him.
JOB.41.32	One would think the deep had white hair.
JOB.41.33	On earth there is not his equal,
JOB.41.33	that is made without fear.
JOB.41.34	He sees everything that is high.
JOB.41.34	He is king over all the sons of pride.”
JOB.42.1	Then Job answered the 
JOB.42.2	“I know that you can do all things,
JOB.42.2	and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.
JOB.42.3	You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’
JOB.42.3	therefore I have uttered that which I didn’t understand,
JOB.42.3	things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.
JOB.42.4	You said, ‘Listen, now, and I will speak;
JOB.42.4	I will question you, and you will answer me.’
JOB.42.5	I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,
JOB.42.5	but now my eye sees you.
JOB.42.6	Therefore I abhor myself,
JOB.42.6	and repent in dust and ashes.”
JOB.42.7	It was so, that after the 
JOB.42.8	Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did what the 
JOB.42.10	The 
JOB.42.11	Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, came to him and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that the 
JOB.42.12	So the 
JOB.42.13	He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch. 
JOB.42.15	In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance amongst their brothers. 
JOB.42.16	After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations. 
JOB.42.17	So Job died, being old and full of days.
PSA.1.1	Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,
PSA.1.1	nor stand on the path of sinners,
PSA.1.1	nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
PSA.1.2	but his delight is in the 
PSA.1.2	On his law he meditates day and night.
PSA.1.3	He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,
PSA.1.3	that produces its fruit in its season,
PSA.1.3	whose leaf also does not wither.
PSA.1.3	Whatever he does shall prosper.
PSA.1.4	The wicked are not so,
PSA.1.4	but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
PSA.1.5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgement,
PSA.1.5	nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
PSA.1.6	For the 
PSA.1.6	but the way of the wicked shall perish.
PSA.2.1	Why do the nations rage,
PSA.2.1	and the peoples plot a vain thing?
PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth take a stand,
PSA.2.2	and the rulers take counsel together,
PSA.2.2	against the 
PSA.2.3	“Let’s break their bonds apart,
PSA.2.3	and cast their cords from us.”
PSA.2.4	He who sits in the heavens will laugh.
PSA.2.4	The Lord
PSA.2.5	Then he will speak to them in his anger,
PSA.2.5	and terrify them in his wrath:
PSA.2.6	“Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”
PSA.2.7	I will tell of the decree:
PSA.2.7	The 
PSA.2.7	Today I have become your father.
PSA.2.8	Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,
PSA.2.8	the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
PSA.2.9	You shall break them with a rod of iron.
PSA.2.9	You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”
PSA.2.10	Now therefore be wise, you kings.
PSA.2.10	Be instructed, you judges of the earth.
PSA.2.11	Serve the 
PSA.2.11	and rejoice with trembling.
PSA.2.12	Give sincere homage to the Son,
PSA.2.12	for his wrath will soon be kindled.
PSA.2.12	Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.
PSA.3.1	, how my adversaries have increased!
PSA.3.1	Many are those who rise up against me.
PSA.3.2	Many there are who say of my soul,
PSA.3.2	“There is no help for him in God.”
PSA.3.3	But you, 
PSA.3.3	my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
PSA.3.4	I cry to the 
PSA.3.4	and he answers me out of his holy hill. 
PSA.3.5	I laid myself down and slept.
PSA.3.5	I awakened; for the 
PSA.3.6	I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people
PSA.3.6	who have set themselves against me on every side.
PSA.3.7	Arise, 
PSA.3.7	Save me, my God!
PSA.3.7	For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone.
PSA.3.7	You have broken the teeth of the wicked.
PSA.3.8	Salvation belongs to the 
PSA.3.8	May your blessing be on your people. 
PSA.4.1	Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.
PSA.4.1	Give me relief from my distress.
PSA.4.1	Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.
PSA.4.2	You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonour?
PSA.4.2	Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? 
PSA.4.3	But know that the 
PSA.4.3	The 
PSA.4.4	Stand in awe, and don’t sin.
PSA.4.4	Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. 
PSA.4.5	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness.
PSA.4.5	Put your trust in the 
PSA.4.6	Many say, “Who will show us any good?”
PSA.4.6	, let the light of your face shine on us.
PSA.4.7	You have put gladness in my heart,
PSA.4.7	more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.
PSA.4.8	In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep,
PSA.4.8	for you, the 
PSA.5.1	Give ear to my words, 
PSA.5.1	Consider my meditation.
PSA.5.2	Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God;
PSA.5.2	for I pray to you.
PSA.5.3	, in the morning you will hear my voice.
PSA.5.3	In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.
PSA.5.4	For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness.
PSA.5.4	Evil can’t live with you.
PSA.5.5	The arrogant will not stand in your sight.
PSA.5.5	You hate all workers of iniquity.
PSA.5.6	You will destroy those who speak lies.
PSA.5.6	The 
PSA.5.7	But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house.
PSA.5.7	I will bow towards your holy temple in reverence of you.
PSA.5.8	Lead me, 
PSA.5.8	Make your way straight before my face.
PSA.5.9	For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.
PSA.5.9	Their heart is destruction.
PSA.5.9	Their throat is an open tomb.
PSA.5.9	They flatter with their tongue.
PSA.5.10	Hold them guilty, God.
PSA.5.10	Let them fall by their own counsels.
PSA.5.10	Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,
PSA.5.10	for they have rebelled against you.
PSA.5.11	But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice.
PSA.5.11	Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them.
PSA.5.11	Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.
PSA.5.12	For you will bless the righteous.
PSA.5.12	, you will surround him with favour as with a shield.
PSA.6.1	, don’t rebuke me in your anger,
PSA.6.1	neither discipline me in your wrath.
PSA.6.2	Have mercy on me, 
PSA.6.2	, heal me, for my bones are troubled.
PSA.6.3	My soul is also in great anguish.
PSA.6.3	But you, 
PSA.6.4	Return, 
PSA.6.4	and save me for your loving kindness’ sake.
PSA.6.5	For in death there is no memory of you.
PSA.6.5	In Sheol,
PSA.6.6	I am weary with my groaning.
PSA.6.6	Every night I flood my bed.
PSA.6.6	I drench my couch with my tears.
PSA.6.7	My eye wastes away because of grief.
PSA.6.7	It grows old because of all my adversaries.
PSA.6.8	Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,
PSA.6.8	for the 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.10	May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed.
PSA.6.10	They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.
PSA.7.1	, my God, I take refuge in you.
PSA.7.1	Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
PSA.7.2	lest they tear apart my soul like a lion,
PSA.7.2	ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver.
PSA.7.3	, my God, if I have done this,
PSA.7.3	if there is iniquity in my hands,
PSA.7.4	if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me
PSA.7.4	(yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),
PSA.7.5	let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;
PSA.7.5	yes, let him tread my life down to the earth,
PSA.7.5	and lay my glory in the dust. 
PSA.7.6	Arise, 
PSA.7.6	Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries.
PSA.7.6	Awake for me. You have commanded judgement.
PSA.7.7	Let the congregation of the peoples surround you.
PSA.7.7	Rule over them on high.
PSA.7.8	The 
PSA.7.8	Judge me, 
PSA.7.8	and to my integrity that is in me.
PSA.7.9	Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,
PSA.7.9	but establish the righteous;
PSA.7.9	their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.
PSA.7.10	My shield is with God,
PSA.7.10	who saves the upright in heart.
PSA.7.11	God is a righteous judge,
PSA.7.11	yes, a God who has indignation every day.
PSA.7.12	If a man doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword;
PSA.7.12	he has bent and strung his bow.
PSA.7.13	He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death.
PSA.7.13	He makes ready his flaming arrows.
PSA.7.14	Behold,
PSA.7.14	Yes, he has conceived mischief,
PSA.7.14	and brought out falsehood.
PSA.7.15	He has dug a hole,
PSA.7.15	and has fallen into the pit which he made.
PSA.7.16	The trouble he causes shall return to his own head.
PSA.7.16	His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.
PSA.7.17	I will give thanks to the 
PSA.7.17	and will sing praise to the name of the 
PSA.8.1	, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
PSA.8.1	You have set your glory above the heavens!
PSA.8.2	From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,
PSA.8.2	because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.8.3	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,
PSA.8.3	the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;
PSA.8.4	what is man, that you think of him?
PSA.8.4	What is the son of man, that you care for him?
PSA.8.5	For you have made him a little lower than the angels,
PSA.8.5	and crowned him with glory and honour.
PSA.8.6	You make him ruler over the works of your hands.
PSA.8.6	You have put all things under his feet:
PSA.8.7	All sheep and cattle,
PSA.8.7	yes, and the animals of the field,
PSA.8.8	the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,
PSA.8.8	and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
PSA.8.9	, our Lord,
PSA.8.9	how majestic is your name in all the earth!
PSA.9.1	I will give thanks to the 
PSA.9.1	I will tell of all your marvellous works.
PSA.9.2	I will be glad and rejoice in you.
PSA.9.2	I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
PSA.9.3	When my enemies turn back,
PSA.9.3	they stumble and perish in your presence.
PSA.9.4	For you have maintained my just cause.
PSA.9.4	You sit on the throne judging righteously.
PSA.9.5	You have rebuked the nations.
PSA.9.5	You have destroyed the wicked.
PSA.9.5	You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
PSA.9.6	The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin.
PSA.9.6	The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.
PSA.9.7	But the 
PSA.9.7	He has prepared his throne for judgement.
PSA.9.8	He will judge the world in righteousness.
PSA.9.8	He will administer judgement to the peoples in uprightness.
PSA.9.9	The 
PSA.9.9	a high tower in times of trouble.
PSA.9.10	Those who know your name will put their trust in you,
PSA.9.10	for you, 
PSA.9.11	Sing praises to the 
PSA.9.11	and declare amongst the people what he has done.
PSA.9.12	For he who avenges blood remembers them.
PSA.9.12	He doesn’t forget the cry of the afflicted.
PSA.9.13	Have mercy on me, 
PSA.9.13	See my affliction by those who hate me,
PSA.9.13	and lift me up from the gates of death,
PSA.9.14	that I may show all of your praise.
PSA.9.14	I will rejoice in your salvation in the gates of the daughter of Zion.
PSA.9.15	The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made.
PSA.9.15	In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.
PSA.9.16	The 
PSA.9.16	He has executed judgement.
PSA.9.16	The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. 
PSA.9.17	The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,
PSA.9.17	even all the nations that forget God.
PSA.9.18	For the needy shall not always be forgotten,
PSA.9.18	nor the hope of the poor perish forever.
PSA.9.19	Arise, 
PSA.9.19	Let the nations be judged in your sight.
PSA.9.20	Put them in fear, 
PSA.9.20	Let the nations know that they are only men. 
PSA.10.1	Why do you stand far off, 
PSA.10.1	Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
PSA.10.2	In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak.
PSA.10.2	They are caught in the schemes that they devise.
PSA.10.3	For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings.
PSA.10.3	He blesses the greedy and condemns the 
PSA.10.4	The wicked, in the pride of his face,
PSA.10.4	has no room in his thoughts for God.
PSA.10.5	His ways are prosperous at all times.
PSA.10.5	He is arrogant, and your laws are far from his sight.
PSA.10.5	As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.
PSA.10.6	He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken.
PSA.10.6	For generations I shall have no trouble.”
PSA.10.7	His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.
PSA.10.7	Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
PSA.10.8	He lies in wait near the villages.
PSA.10.8	From ambushes, he murders the innocent.
PSA.10.8	His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.
PSA.10.9	He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush.
PSA.10.9	He lies in wait to catch the helpless.
PSA.10.9	He catches the helpless when he draws him in his net.
PSA.10.10	The helpless are crushed.
PSA.10.10	They collapse.
PSA.10.10	They fall under his strength.
PSA.10.11	He says in his heart, “God has forgotten.
PSA.10.11	He hides his face.
PSA.10.11	He will never see it.”
PSA.10.12	Arise, 
PSA.10.12	God, lift up your hand!
PSA.10.12	Don’t forget the helpless.
PSA.10.13	Why does the wicked person condemn God,
PSA.10.13	and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account?”
PSA.10.14	But you do see trouble and grief.
PSA.10.14	You consider it to take it into your hand.
PSA.10.14	You help the victim and the fatherless.
PSA.10.15	Break the arm of the wicked.
PSA.10.15	As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.
PSA.10.16	The 
PSA.10.16	The nations will perish out of his land.
PSA.10.17	, you have heard the desire of the humble.
PSA.10.17	You will prepare their heart.
PSA.10.17	You will cause your ear to hear,
PSA.10.18	to judge the fatherless and the oppressed,
PSA.10.18	that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.
PSA.11.1	In the 
PSA.11.1	How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain”?
PSA.11.2	For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.
PSA.11.2	They set their arrows on the strings,
PSA.11.2	that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
PSA.11.3	If the foundations are destroyed,
PSA.11.3	what can the righteous do?
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.4	His eyes observe.
PSA.11.4	His eyes examine the children of men.
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.5	but his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence.
PSA.11.6	On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;
PSA.11.6	fire, sulphur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
PSA.11.7	For the 
PSA.11.7	He loves righteousness.
PSA.11.7	The upright shall see his face.
PSA.12.1	Help, 
PSA.12.1	For the faithful fail from amongst the children of men.
PSA.12.2	Everyone lies to his neighbour.
PSA.12.2	They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.
PSA.12.3	May the 
PSA.12.3	and the tongue that boasts,
PSA.12.4	who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail.
PSA.12.4	Our lips are our own.
PSA.12.4	Who is lord over us?”
PSA.12.5	“Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy,
PSA.12.5	I will now arise,” says the 
PSA.12.5	“I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”
PSA.12.6	The 
PSA.12.6	as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.
PSA.12.7	You will keep them, 
PSA.12.7	You will preserve them from this generation forever.
PSA.12.8	The wicked walk on every side,
PSA.12.8	when what is vile is exalted amongst the sons of men.
PSA.13.1	How long, 
PSA.13.1	Will you forget me forever?
PSA.13.1	How long will you hide your face from me?
PSA.13.2	How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
PSA.13.2	having sorrow in my heart every day?
PSA.13.2	How long shall my enemy triumph over me?
PSA.13.3	Behold, and answer me, 
PSA.13.3	Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;
PSA.13.4	lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;”
PSA.13.4	lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.
PSA.13.5	But I trust in your loving kindness.
PSA.13.5	My heart rejoices in your salvation.
PSA.13.6	I will sing to the 
PSA.13.6	because he has been good to me.
PSA.14.1	The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”
PSA.14.1	They are corrupt.
PSA.14.1	They have done abominable deeds.
PSA.14.1	There is no one who does good.
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.2	to see if there were any who understood,
PSA.14.2	who sought after God.
PSA.14.3	They have all gone aside.
PSA.14.3	They have together become corrupt.
PSA.14.3	There is no one who does good, no, not one.
PSA.14.4	Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,
PSA.14.4	who eat up my people as they eat bread,
PSA.14.4	and don’t call on the 
PSA.14.5	There they were in great fear,
PSA.14.5	for God is in the generation of the righteous.
PSA.14.6	You frustrate the plan of the poor,
PSA.14.6	because the 
PSA.14.7	Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!
PSA.14.7	When the 
PSA.14.7	then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
PSA.15.1	, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?
PSA.15.1	Who shall live on your holy hill?
PSA.15.2	He who walks blamelessly and does what is right,
PSA.15.2	and speaks truth in his heart;
PSA.15.3	he who doesn’t slander with his tongue,
PSA.15.3	nor does evil to his friend,
PSA.15.3	nor casts slurs against his fellow man;
PSA.15.4	in whose eyes a vile man is despised,
PSA.15.4	but who honours those who fear the 
PSA.15.4	he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change;
PSA.15.5	he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury,
PSA.15.5	nor take a bribe against the innocent.
PSA.15.5	He who does these things shall never be shaken.
PSA.16.1	Preserve me, God, for I take refuge in you.
PSA.16.2	My soul, you have said to the 
PSA.16.2	Apart from you I have no good thing.”
PSA.16.3	As for the saints who are in the earth,
PSA.16.3	they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.
PSA.16.4	Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god.
PSA.16.4	Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,
PSA.16.4	nor take their names on my lips.
PSA.16.5	The 
PSA.16.5	You made my lot secure.
PSA.16.6	The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.
PSA.16.6	Yes, I have a good inheritance.
PSA.16.7	I will bless the 
PSA.16.7	Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.
PSA.16.8	I have set the 
PSA.16.8	Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
PSA.16.9	Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices.
PSA.16.9	My body shall also dwell in safety.
PSA.16.10	For you will not leave my soul in Sheol,
PSA.16.10	neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.
PSA.16.11	You will show me the path of life.
PSA.16.11	In your presence is fullness of joy.
PSA.16.11	In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.
PSA.17.1	Hear, 
PSA.17.1	Give ear to my prayer that doesn’t go out of deceitful lips.
PSA.17.2	Let my sentence come out of your presence.
PSA.17.2	Let your eyes look on equity.
PSA.17.3	You have proved my heart.
PSA.17.3	You have visited me in the night.
PSA.17.3	You have tried me, and found nothing.
PSA.17.3	I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.
PSA.17.4	As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips,
PSA.17.4	I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.
PSA.17.5	My steps have held fast to your paths.
PSA.17.5	My feet have not slipped.
PSA.17.6	I have called on you, for you will answer me, God.
PSA.17.6	Turn your ear to me.
PSA.17.6	Hear my speech.
PSA.17.7	Show your marvellous loving kindness,
PSA.17.7	you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.
PSA.17.8	Keep me as the apple of your eye.
PSA.17.8	Hide me under the shadow of your wings,
PSA.17.9	from the wicked who oppress me,
PSA.17.9	my deadly enemies, who surround me.
PSA.17.10	They close up their callous hearts.
PSA.17.10	With their mouth they speak proudly.
PSA.17.11	They have now surrounded us in our steps.
PSA.17.11	They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.
PSA.17.12	He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,
PSA.17.12	as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
PSA.17.13	Arise, 
PSA.17.13	Cast him down.
PSA.17.13	Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,
PSA.17.14	from men by your hand, 
PSA.17.14	from men of the world, whose portion is in this life.
PSA.17.14	You fill the belly of your cherished ones.
PSA.17.14	Your sons have plenty,
PSA.17.14	and they store up wealth for their children.
PSA.17.15	As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness.
PSA.17.15	I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.
PSA.18.1	I love you, 
PSA.18.2	The 
PSA.18.2	my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;
PSA.18.2	my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.
PSA.18.3	I call on the 
PSA.18.3	and I am saved from my enemies.
PSA.18.4	The cords of death surrounded me.
PSA.18.4	The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
PSA.18.5	The cords of Sheol
PSA.18.5	The snares of death came on me.
PSA.18.6	In my distress I called on the 
PSA.18.6	and cried to my God.
PSA.18.6	He heard my voice out of his temple.
PSA.18.6	My cry before him came into his ears.
PSA.18.7	Then the earth shook and trembled.
PSA.18.7	The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken,
PSA.18.7	because he was angry.
PSA.18.8	Smoke went out of his nostrils.
PSA.18.8	Consuming fire came out of his mouth.
PSA.18.8	Coals were kindled by it.
PSA.18.9	He bowed the heavens also, and came down.
PSA.18.9	Thick darkness was under his feet.
PSA.18.10	He rode on a cherub, and flew.
PSA.18.10	Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,
PSA.18.11	darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
PSA.18.12	At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,
PSA.18.12	hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.13	The 
PSA.18.13	The Most High uttered his voice:
PSA.18.13	hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.14	He sent out his arrows, and scattered them.
PSA.18.14	He routed them with great lightning bolts.
PSA.18.15	Then the channels of waters appeared.
PSA.18.15	The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, 
PSA.18.15	at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
PSA.18.16	He sent from on high.
PSA.18.16	He took me.
PSA.18.16	He drew me out of many waters.
PSA.18.17	He delivered me from my strong enemy,
PSA.18.17	from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
PSA.18.18	They came on me in the day of my calamity,
PSA.18.18	but the 
PSA.18.19	He brought me out also into a large place.
PSA.18.19	He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
PSA.18.20	The 
PSA.18.20	According to the cleanness of my hands, he has recompensed me.
PSA.18.21	For I have kept the ways of the 
PSA.18.21	and have not wickedly departed from my God.
PSA.18.22	For all his ordinances were before me.
PSA.18.22	I didn’t put away his statutes from me.
PSA.18.23	I was also blameless with him.
PSA.18.23	I kept myself from my iniquity.
PSA.18.24	Therefore the 
PSA.18.24	according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
PSA.18.25	With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
PSA.18.25	With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.
PSA.18.26	With the pure, you will show yourself pure.
PSA.18.26	With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.
PSA.18.27	For you will save the afflicted people,
PSA.18.27	but the arrogant eyes you will bring down.
PSA.18.28	For you will light my lamp, 
PSA.18.28	My God will light up my darkness.
PSA.18.29	For by you, I advance through a troop.
PSA.18.29	By my God, I leap over a wall.
PSA.18.30	As for God, his way is perfect.
PSA.18.30	The 
PSA.18.30	He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
PSA.18.31	For who is God, except the 
PSA.18.31	Who is a rock, besides our God,
PSA.18.32	the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?
PSA.18.33	He makes my feet like deer’s feet,
PSA.18.33	and sets me on my high places.
PSA.18.34	He teaches my hands to war,
PSA.18.34	so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.
PSA.18.35	You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
PSA.18.35	Your right hand sustains me.
PSA.18.35	Your gentleness has made me great.
PSA.18.36	You have enlarged my steps under me,
PSA.18.36	My feet have not slipped.
PSA.18.37	I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.
PSA.18.37	I won’t turn away until they are consumed.
PSA.18.38	I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.
PSA.18.38	They shall fall under my feet.
PSA.18.39	For you have armed me with strength to the battle.
PSA.18.39	You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
PSA.18.40	You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,
PSA.18.40	that I might cut off those who hate me.
PSA.18.41	They cried, but there was no one to save;
PSA.18.41	even to the 
PSA.18.42	Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.
PSA.18.42	I cast them out as the mire of the streets.
PSA.18.43	You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.
PSA.18.43	You have made me the head of the nations.
PSA.18.43	A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
PSA.18.44	As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.
PSA.18.44	The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.
PSA.18.45	The foreigners shall fade away,
PSA.18.45	and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.
PSA.18.46	The 
PSA.18.46	Exalted be the God of my salvation,
PSA.18.47	even the God who executes vengeance for me,
PSA.18.47	and subdues peoples under me.
PSA.18.48	He rescues me from my enemies.
PSA.18.48	Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.
PSA.18.48	You deliver me from the violent man.
PSA.18.49	Therefore I will give thanks to you, 
PSA.18.49	and will sing praises to your name.
PSA.18.50	He gives great deliverance to his king,
PSA.18.50	and shows loving kindness to his anointed,
PSA.18.50	to David and to his offspring,
PSA.19.1	The heavens declare the glory of God.
PSA.19.1	The expanse shows his handiwork.
PSA.19.2	Day after day they pour out speech,
PSA.19.2	and night after night they display knowledge.
PSA.19.3	There is no speech nor language,
PSA.19.3	where their voice is not heard.
PSA.19.4	Their voice has gone out through all the earth,
PSA.19.4	their words to the end of the world.
PSA.19.4	In them he has set a tent for the sun,
PSA.19.5	which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room,
PSA.19.5	like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.
PSA.19.6	His going out is from the end of the heavens,
PSA.19.6	his circuit to its ends.
PSA.19.6	There is nothing hidden from its heat.
PSA.19.7	The 
PSA.19.7	The 
PSA.19.8	The 
PSA.19.8	The 
PSA.19.9	The fear of the 
PSA.19.9	The 
PSA.19.10	They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold,
PSA.19.10	sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.
PSA.19.11	Moreover your servant is warned by them.
PSA.19.11	In keeping them there is great reward.
PSA.19.12	Who can discern his errors?
PSA.19.12	Forgive me from hidden errors.
PSA.19.13	Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.
PSA.19.13	Let them not have dominion over me.
PSA.19.13	Then I will be upright.
PSA.19.13	I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.
PSA.19.14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
PSA.19.14	be acceptable in your sight,
PSA.19.14	, my rock, and my redeemer.
PSA.20.1	May the 
PSA.20.1	May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,
PSA.20.2	send you help from the sanctuary,
PSA.20.2	grant you support from Zion,
PSA.20.3	remember all your offerings,
PSA.20.3	and accept your burnt sacrifice. 
PSA.20.4	May he grant you your heart’s desire,
PSA.20.4	and fulfil all your counsel.
PSA.20.5	We will triumph in your salvation.
PSA.20.5	In the name of our God, we will set up our banners.
PSA.20.5	May the 
PSA.20.6	Now I know that the 
PSA.20.6	He will answer him from his holy heaven,
PSA.20.6	with the saving strength of his right hand.
PSA.20.7	Some trust in chariots, and some in horses,
PSA.20.7	but we trust in the name of the 
PSA.20.8	They are bowed down and fallen,
PSA.20.8	but we rise up, and stand upright.
PSA.20.9	Save, 
PSA.20.9	Let the King answer us when we call!
PSA.21.1	The king rejoices in your strength, 
PSA.21.1	How greatly he rejoices in your salvation!
PSA.21.2	You have given him his heart’s desire,
PSA.21.2	and have not withheld the request of his lips. 
PSA.21.3	For you meet him with the blessings of goodness.
PSA.21.3	You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
PSA.21.4	He asked life of you and you gave it to him,
PSA.21.4	even length of days forever and ever.
PSA.21.5	His glory is great in your salvation.
PSA.21.5	You lay honour and majesty on him.
PSA.21.6	For you make him most blessed forever.
PSA.21.6	You make him glad with joy in your presence.
PSA.21.7	For the king trusts in the 
PSA.21.7	Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved.
PSA.21.8	Your hand will find out all of your enemies.
PSA.21.8	Your right hand will find out those who hate you.
PSA.21.9	You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger.
PSA.21.9	The 
PSA.21.9	The fire shall devour them.
PSA.21.10	You will destroy their descendants from the earth,
PSA.21.10	their posterity from amongst the children of men.
PSA.21.11	For they intended evil against you.
PSA.21.11	They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed.
PSA.21.12	For you will make them turn their back,
PSA.21.12	when you aim drawn bows at their face.
PSA.21.13	Be exalted, 
PSA.21.13	so we will sing and praise your power.
PSA.22.1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
PSA.22.1	Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?
PSA.22.2	My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer;
PSA.22.2	in the night season, and am not silent.
PSA.22.3	But you are holy,
PSA.22.3	you who inhabit the praises of Israel.
PSA.22.4	Our fathers trusted in you.
PSA.22.4	They trusted, and you delivered them.
PSA.22.5	They cried to you, and were delivered.
PSA.22.5	They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.
PSA.22.6	But I am a worm, and no man;
PSA.22.6	a reproach of men, and despised by the people.
PSA.22.7	All those who see me mock me.
PSA.22.7	They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,
PSA.22.8	“He trusts in the 
PSA.22.8	Let him deliver him.
PSA.22.8	Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.”
PSA.22.9	But you brought me out of the womb.
PSA.22.9	You made me trust while at my mother’s breasts.
PSA.22.10	I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb.
PSA.22.10	You are my God since my mother bore me.
PSA.22.11	Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near.
PSA.22.11	For there is no one to help.
PSA.22.12	Many bulls have surrounded me.
PSA.22.12	Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.
PSA.22.13	They open their mouths wide against me,
PSA.22.13	lions tearing prey and roaring.
PSA.22.14	I am poured out like water.
PSA.22.14	All my bones are out of joint.
PSA.22.14	My heart is like wax.
PSA.22.14	It is melted within me.
PSA.22.15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd.
PSA.22.15	My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.
PSA.22.15	You have brought me into the dust of death.
PSA.22.16	For dogs have surrounded me.
PSA.22.16	A company of evildoers have enclosed me.
PSA.22.16	They have pierced my hands and feet.
PSA.22.17	I can count all of my bones.
PSA.22.17	They look and stare at me.
PSA.22.18	They divide my garments amongst them.
PSA.22.18	They cast lots for my clothing.
PSA.22.19	But don’t be far off, 
PSA.22.19	You are my help. Hurry to help me!
PSA.22.20	Deliver my soul from the sword,
PSA.22.20	my precious life from the power of the dog.
PSA.22.21	Save me from the lion’s mouth!
PSA.22.21	Yes, you have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen.
PSA.22.22	I will declare your name to my brothers.
PSA.22.22	Amongst the assembly, I will praise you.
PSA.22.23	You who fear the 
PSA.22.23	All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him!
PSA.22.23	Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!
PSA.22.24	For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted,
PSA.22.24	Neither has he hidden his face from him;
PSA.22.24	but when he cried to him, he heard.
PSA.22.25	My praise of you comes in the great assembly.
PSA.22.25	I will pay my vows before those who fear him.
PSA.22.26	The humble shall eat and be satisfied.
PSA.22.26	They shall praise the 
PSA.22.26	Let your hearts live forever.
PSA.22.27	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the 
PSA.22.27	All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.
PSA.22.28	For the kingdom is the 
PSA.22.28	He is the ruler over the nations.
PSA.22.29	All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.
PSA.22.29	All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,
PSA.22.29	even he who can’t keep his soul alive.
PSA.22.30	Posterity shall serve him.
PSA.22.30	Future generations shall be told about the Lord.
PSA.22.31	They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born,
PSA.22.31	for he has done it.
PSA.23.1	The 
PSA.23.1	I shall lack nothing.
PSA.23.2	He makes me lie down in green pastures.
PSA.23.2	He leads me beside still waters.
PSA.23.3	He restores my soul.
PSA.23.3	He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.
PSA.23.4	Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
PSA.23.4	I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
PSA.23.4	Your rod and your staff,
PSA.23.4	they comfort me.
PSA.23.5	You prepare a table before me
PSA.23.5	in the presence of my enemies.
PSA.23.5	You anoint my head with oil.
PSA.23.5	My cup runs over.
PSA.23.6	Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life,
PSA.23.6	and I will dwell in the 
PSA.24.1	The earth is the 
PSA.24.1	the world, and those who dwell in it.
PSA.24.2	For he has founded it on the seas,
PSA.24.2	and established it on the floods.
PSA.24.3	Who may ascend to the 
PSA.24.3	Who may stand in his holy place?
PSA.24.4	He who has clean hands and a pure heart;
PSA.24.4	who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood,
PSA.24.4	and has not sworn deceitfully.
PSA.24.5	He shall receive a blessing from the 
PSA.24.5	righteousness from the God of his salvation.
PSA.24.6	This is the generation of those who seek Him,
PSA.24.6	who seek your face—even Jacob. 
PSA.24.7	Lift up your heads, you gates!
PSA.24.7	Be lifted up, you everlasting doors,
PSA.24.7	and the King of glory will come in.
PSA.24.8	Who is the King of glory?
PSA.24.8	The 
PSA.24.8	The 
PSA.24.9	Lift up your heads, you gates;
PSA.24.9	yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors,
PSA.24.9	and the King of glory will come in.
PSA.24.10	Who is this King of glory?
PSA.24.10	The 
PSA.25.1	To you, 
PSA.25.2	My God, I have trusted in you.
PSA.25.2	Don’t let me be shamed.
PSA.25.2	Don’t let my enemies triumph over me.
PSA.25.3	Yes, no one who waits for you will be shamed.
PSA.25.3	They will be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.
PSA.25.4	Show me your ways, 
PSA.25.4	Teach me your paths.
PSA.25.5	Guide me in your truth, and teach me,
PSA.25.5	For you are the God of my salvation,
PSA.25.5	I wait for you all day long.
PSA.25.6	, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness,
PSA.25.6	for they are from old times.
PSA.25.7	Don’t remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.

PSA.25.7	for your goodness’ sake, 
PSA.25.8	Good and upright is the 
PSA.25.8	therefore he will instruct sinners in the way.
PSA.25.9	He will guide the humble in justice.
PSA.25.9	He will teach the humble his way.
PSA.25.10	All the paths of the 
PSA.25.10	to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
PSA.25.11	For your name’s sake, 
PSA.25.11	pardon my iniquity, for it is great.
PSA.25.12	What man is he who fears the 
PSA.25.12	He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose.
PSA.25.13	His soul will dwell at ease.
PSA.25.13	His offspring will inherit the land.
PSA.25.14	The friendship of the 
PSA.25.14	He will show them his covenant.
PSA.25.15	My eyes are ever on the 
PSA.25.15	for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
PSA.25.16	Turn to me, and have mercy on me,
PSA.25.16	for I am desolate and afflicted.
PSA.25.17	The troubles of my heart are enlarged.
PSA.25.17	Oh bring me out of my distresses.
PSA.25.18	Consider my affliction and my travail.
PSA.25.18	Forgive all my sins.
PSA.25.19	Consider my enemies, for they are many.
PSA.25.19	They hate me with cruel hatred.
PSA.25.20	Oh keep my soul, and deliver me.
PSA.25.20	Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you.
PSA.25.21	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,
PSA.25.21	for I wait for you.
PSA.25.22	God, redeem Israel
PSA.25.22	out of all his troubles.
PSA.26.1	Judge me, 
PSA.26.1	I have trusted also in 
PSA.26.2	Examine me, 
PSA.26.2	Try my heart and my mind.
PSA.26.3	For your loving kindness is before my eyes.
PSA.26.3	I have walked in your truth.
PSA.26.4	I have not sat with deceitful men,
PSA.26.4	neither will I go in with hypocrites.
PSA.26.5	I hate the assembly of evildoers,
PSA.26.5	and will not sit with the wicked.
PSA.26.6	I will wash my hands in innocence,
PSA.26.6	so I will go about your altar, 
PSA.26.7	that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard
PSA.26.7	and tell of all your wondrous deeds.
PSA.26.8	, I love the habitation of your house,
PSA.26.8	the place where your glory dwells.
PSA.26.9	Don’t gather my soul with sinners,
PSA.26.9	nor my life with bloodthirsty men;
PSA.26.10	in whose hands is wickedness,
PSA.26.10	their right hand is full of bribes.
PSA.26.11	But as for me, I will walk in my integrity.
PSA.26.11	Redeem me, and be merciful to me.
PSA.26.12	My foot stands in an even place.
PSA.26.12	In the congregations I will bless the 
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	Whom shall I fear?
PSA.27.1	The 
PSA.27.1	Of whom shall I be afraid?
PSA.27.2	When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh,
PSA.27.2	even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
PSA.27.3	Though an army should encamp against me,
PSA.27.3	my heart shall not fear.
PSA.27.3	Though war should rise against me,
PSA.27.3	even then I will be confident.
PSA.27.4	One thing I have asked of the 
PSA.27.4	that I may dwell in the 
PSA.27.4	to see the 
PSA.27.4	and to enquire in his temple.
PSA.27.5	For in the day of trouble, he will keep me secretly in his pavilion.
PSA.27.5	In the secret place of his tabernacle, he will hide me.
PSA.27.5	He will lift me up on a rock.
PSA.27.6	Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me.
PSA.27.6	I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.
PSA.27.6	I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the 
PSA.27.7	Hear, 
PSA.27.7	Have mercy also on me, and answer me.
PSA.27.8	When you said, “Seek my face,”
PSA.27.8	my heart said to you, “I will seek your face, 
PSA.27.9	Don’t hide your face from me.
PSA.27.9	Don’t put your servant away in anger.
PSA.27.9	You have been my help.
PSA.27.9	Don’t abandon me,
PSA.27.9	neither forsake me, God of my salvation.
PSA.27.10	When my father and my mother forsake me,
PSA.27.10	then the 
PSA.27.11	Teach me your way, 
PSA.27.11	Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies.
PSA.27.12	Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,
PSA.27.12	for false witnesses have risen up against me,
PSA.27.12	such as breathe out cruelty.
PSA.27.13	I am still confident of this:
PSA.27.13	I will see the goodness of the 
PSA.27.14	Wait for the 
PSA.27.14	Be strong, and let your heart take courage.
PSA.27.14	Yes, wait for the 
PSA.28.1	To you, 
PSA.28.1	My rock, don’t be deaf to me,
PSA.28.1	lest, if you are silent to me,
PSA.28.1	I would become like those who go down into the pit.
PSA.28.2	Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you,
PSA.28.2	when I lift up my hands towards your Most Holy Place.
PSA.28.3	Don’t draw me away with the wicked,
PSA.28.3	with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbours,
PSA.28.3	but mischief is in their hearts.
PSA.28.4	Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings.
PSA.28.4	Give them according to the operation of their hands.
PSA.28.4	Bring back on them what they deserve.
PSA.28.5	Because they don’t respect the works of the 
PSA.28.5	nor the operation of his hands,
PSA.28.5	he will break them down and not build them up.
PSA.28.6	Blessed be the 
PSA.28.6	because he has heard the voice of my petitions.
PSA.28.7	The 
PSA.28.7	My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped.
PSA.28.7	Therefore my heart greatly rejoices.
PSA.28.7	With my song I will thank him.
PSA.28.8	The 
PSA.28.8	He is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.
PSA.28.9	Save your people,
PSA.28.9	and bless your inheritance.
PSA.28.9	Be their shepherd also,
PSA.28.9	and bear them up forever.

PSA.29.5	The 
PSA.29.5	Yes, the 
PSA.29.6	He makes them also to skip like a calf;

PSA.29.10	Yes, the 
PSA.29.11	The 
PSA.29.11	The 
PSA.30.1	I will extol you, 
PSA.30.1	and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.
PSA.30.2	 my God, I cried to you,
PSA.30.2	and you have healed me.
PSA.30.3	, you have brought up my soul from Sheol.
PSA.30.3	You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
PSA.30.4	Sing praise to the 
PSA.30.4	Give thanks to his holy name.
PSA.30.5	For his anger is but for a moment.
PSA.30.5	His favour is for a lifetime.
PSA.30.5	Weeping may stay for the night,
PSA.30.5	but joy comes in the morning.
PSA.30.6	As for me, I said in my prosperity,
PSA.30.6	“I shall never be moved.”
PSA.30.7	You, 
PSA.30.7	but when you hid your face, I was troubled.
PSA.30.8	I cried to you, 
PSA.30.8	I made supplication to the Lord:
PSA.30.9	“What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit?
PSA.30.9	Shall the dust praise you?
PSA.30.9	Shall it declare your truth?
PSA.30.10	Hear, 
PSA.30.10	, be my helper.”
PSA.30.11	You have turned my mourning into dancing for me.
PSA.30.11	You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,
PSA.30.12	to the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent.
PSA.30.12	 my God, I will give thanks to you forever!
PSA.31.1	In you, 
PSA.31.1	Let me never be disappointed.
PSA.31.1	Deliver me in your righteousness.
PSA.31.2	Bow down your ear to me.
PSA.31.2	Deliver me speedily.
PSA.31.2	Be to me a strong rock,
PSA.31.2	a house of defence to save me.
PSA.31.3	For you are my rock and my fortress,
PSA.31.3	therefore for your name’s sake lead me and guide me.
PSA.31.4	Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,
PSA.31.4	for you are my stronghold.
PSA.31.5	Into your hand I commend my spirit.
PSA.31.5	You redeem me, 
PSA.31.6	I hate those who regard lying vanities,
PSA.31.6	but I trust in the 
PSA.31.7	I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness,
PSA.31.7	for you have seen my affliction.
PSA.31.7	You have known my soul in adversities.
PSA.31.8	You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.
PSA.31.8	You have set my feet in a large place.
PSA.31.9	Have mercy on me, 
PSA.31.9	My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief.
PSA.31.10	For my life is spent with sorrow,
PSA.31.10	my years with sighing.
PSA.31.10	My strength fails because of my iniquity.
PSA.31.10	My bones are wasted away.
PSA.31.11	Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbours,
PSA.31.11	a horror to my acquaintances.
PSA.31.11	Those who saw me on the street fled from me.
PSA.31.12	I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man.
PSA.31.12	I am like broken pottery.
PSA.31.13	For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side,
PSA.31.13	while they conspire together against me,
PSA.31.13	they plot to take away my life.
PSA.31.14	But I trust in you, 
PSA.31.14	I said, “You are my God.”
PSA.31.15	My times are in your hand.
PSA.31.15	Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.
PSA.31.16	Make your face to shine on your servant.
PSA.31.16	Save me in your loving kindness.
PSA.31.17	Let me not be disappointed, 
PSA.31.17	Let the wicked be disappointed.
PSA.31.17	Let them be silent in Sheol.
PSA.31.18	Let the lying lips be mute,
PSA.31.18	which speak against the righteous insolently, with pride and contempt.
PSA.31.19	Oh how great is your goodness,
PSA.31.19	which you have laid up for those who fear you,
PSA.31.19	which you have worked for those who take refuge in you,
PSA.31.19	before the sons of men!
PSA.31.20	In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man.
PSA.31.20	You will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues.
PSA.31.21	Praise be to the 
PSA.31.21	for he has shown me his marvellous loving kindness in a strong city.
PSA.31.22	As for me, I said in my haste, “I am cut off from before your eyes.”
PSA.31.22	Nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when I cried to you.
PSA.31.23	Oh love the 
PSA.31.23	The 
PSA.31.23	and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly.
PSA.31.24	Be strong, and let your heart take courage,
PSA.31.24	all you who hope in the 
PSA.32.1	Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven,
PSA.32.1	whose sin is covered.
PSA.32.2	Blessed is the man to whom the 
PSA.32.2	in whose spirit there is no deceit.
PSA.32.3	When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
PSA.32.4	For day and night your hand was heavy on me.
PSA.32.4	My strength was sapped in the heat of summer. 
PSA.32.5	I acknowledged my sin to you.
PSA.32.5	I didn’t hide my iniquity.
PSA.32.5	I said, I will confess my transgressions to the 
PSA.32.5	and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. 
PSA.32.6	For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found.
PSA.32.6	Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.
PSA.32.7	You are my hiding place.
PSA.32.7	You will preserve me from trouble.
PSA.32.7	You will surround me with songs of deliverance. 
PSA.32.8	I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.
PSA.32.8	I will counsel you with my eye on you.
PSA.32.9	Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding,
PSA.32.9	who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you.
PSA.32.10	Many sorrows come to the wicked,
PSA.32.10	but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in the 
PSA.32.11	Be glad in the 
PSA.32.11	Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!
PSA.33.1	Rejoice in the 
PSA.33.1	Praise is fitting for the upright.
PSA.33.2	Give thanks to the 
PSA.33.2	Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.
PSA.33.3	Sing to him a new song.
PSA.33.3	Play skilfully with a shout of joy!
PSA.33.4	For the 
PSA.33.4	All his work is done in faithfulness.
PSA.33.5	He loves righteousness and justice.
PSA.33.5	The earth is full of the loving kindness of the 
PSA.33.6	By the 
PSA.33.6	all their army by the breath of his mouth.
PSA.33.7	He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.
PSA.33.7	He lays up the deeps in storehouses.
PSA.33.8	Let all the earth fear the 
PSA.33.8	Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
PSA.33.9	For he spoke, and it was done.
PSA.33.9	He commanded, and it stood firm.
PSA.33.10	The 
PSA.33.10	He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
PSA.33.11	The counsel of the 
PSA.33.11	the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
PSA.33.12	Blessed is the nation whose God is the 
PSA.33.12	the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.
PSA.33.13	The 
PSA.33.13	He sees all the sons of men.
PSA.33.14	From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth,
PSA.33.15	he who fashions all of their hearts;
PSA.33.15	and he considers all of their works.
PSA.33.16	There is no king saved by the multitude of an army.
PSA.33.16	A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
PSA.33.17	A horse is a vain thing for safety,
PSA.33.17	neither does he deliver any by his great power.
PSA.33.18	Behold, the 
PSA.33.18	on those who hope in his loving kindness,
PSA.33.19	to deliver their soul from death,
PSA.33.19	to keep them alive in famine.
PSA.33.20	Our soul has waited for the 
PSA.33.20	He is our help and our shield.
PSA.33.21	For our heart rejoices in him,
PSA.33.21	because we have trusted in his holy name.
PSA.33.22	Let your loving kindness be on us, 
PSA.33.22	since we have hoped in you.
PSA.34.1	His praise will always be in my mouth.
PSA.34.2	My soul shall boast in the 
PSA.34.2	The humble shall hear of it and be glad.
PSA.34.3	Oh magnify the 
PSA.34.3	Let’s exalt his name together.
PSA.34.4	I sought the 
PSA.34.4	and delivered me from all my fears.
PSA.34.5	They looked to him, and were radiant.
PSA.34.5	Their faces shall never be covered with shame.
PSA.34.6	This poor man cried, and the 
PSA.34.6	and saved him out of all his troubles.
PSA.34.7	The 
PSA.34.7	and delivers them.
PSA.34.8	Oh taste and see that the 
PSA.34.8	Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
PSA.34.9	Oh fear the 
PSA.34.9	for there is no lack with those who fear him.
PSA.34.10	The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger,
PSA.34.10	but those who seek the 
PSA.34.11	Come, you children, listen to me.
PSA.34.11	I will teach you the fear of the 
PSA.34.12	Who is someone who desires life,
PSA.34.12	and loves many days, that he may see good?
PSA.34.13	Keep your tongue from evil,
PSA.34.13	and your lips from speaking lies.
PSA.34.14	Depart from evil, and do good.
PSA.34.14	Seek peace, and pursue it.
PSA.34.15	The 
PSA.34.15	His ears listen to their cry.
PSA.34.16	The 
PSA.34.16	to cut off their memory from the earth.
PSA.34.17	The righteous cry, and the 
PSA.34.17	and delivers them out of all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.18	and saves those who have a crushed spirit.
PSA.34.19	Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
PSA.34.19	but the 
PSA.34.20	He protects all of his bones.
PSA.34.20	Not one of them is broken.
PSA.34.21	Evil shall kill the wicked.
PSA.34.21	Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned.
PSA.34.22	The 
PSA.34.22	None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.
PSA.35.1	Contend, 
PSA.35.1	Fight against those who fight against me.
PSA.35.2	Take hold of shield and buckler,
PSA.35.2	and stand up for my help.
PSA.35.3	Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me.
PSA.35.3	Tell my soul, “I am your salvation.”
PSA.35.4	Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonour.
PSA.35.4	Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded.
PSA.35.5	Let them be as chaff before the wind,
PSA.35.5	The 
PSA.35.6	Let their way be dark and slippery,
PSA.35.6	The 
PSA.35.7	For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me.
PSA.35.7	Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.
PSA.35.8	Let destruction come on him unawares.
PSA.35.8	Let his net that he has hidden catch himself.
PSA.35.8	Let him fall into that destruction.
PSA.35.9	My soul shall be joyful in the 
PSA.35.9	It shall rejoice in his salvation.
PSA.35.10	All my bones shall say, “
PSA.35.10	who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him;
PSA.35.10	yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?”
PSA.35.11	Unrighteous witnesses rise up.
PSA.35.11	They ask me about things that I don’t know about.
PSA.35.12	They reward me evil for good,
PSA.35.12	to the bereaving of my soul.
PSA.35.13	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth.
PSA.35.13	I afflicted my soul with fasting.
PSA.35.13	My prayer returned into my own bosom.
PSA.35.14	I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother.
PSA.35.14	I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother.
PSA.35.15	But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together.
PSA.35.15	The attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I didn’t know it.
PSA.35.15	They tore at me, and didn’t cease.
PSA.35.16	Like the profane mockers in feasts,
PSA.35.16	they gnashed their teeth at me.
PSA.35.17	Lord, how long will you look on?
PSA.35.17	Rescue my soul from their destruction,
PSA.35.17	my precious life from the lions.
PSA.35.18	I will give you thanks in the great assembly.
PSA.35.18	I will praise you amongst many people.
PSA.35.19	Don’t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;
PSA.35.19	neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.
PSA.35.20	For they don’t speak peace,
PSA.35.20	but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.
PSA.35.21	Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.
PSA.35.21	They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!”
PSA.35.22	You have seen it, 
PSA.35.22	Lord, don’t be far from me.
PSA.35.23	Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God!
PSA.35.23	My Lord, contend for me!
PSA.35.24	Vindicate me, 
PSA.35.24	Don’t let them gloat over me.
PSA.35.25	Don’t let them say in their heart, “Aha! That’s the way we want it!”
PSA.35.25	Don’t let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”
PSA.35.26	Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity.
PSA.35.26	Let them be clothed with shame and dishonour who magnify themselves against me.
PSA.35.27	Let those who favour my righteous cause shout for joy and be glad.
PSA.35.27	Yes, let them say continually, “May The 
PSA.35.27	who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!”
PSA.35.28	My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long.
PSA.36.1	A revelation is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked:
PSA.36.1	“There is no fear of God before his eyes.”
PSA.36.2	For he flatters himself in his own eyes,
PSA.36.2	too much to detect and hate his sin.
PSA.36.3	The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit.
PSA.36.3	He has ceased to be wise and to do good.
PSA.36.4	He plots iniquity on his bed.
PSA.36.4	He sets himself in a way that is not good.
PSA.36.4	He doesn’t abhor evil.
PSA.36.5	Your loving kindness, 
PSA.36.5	Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
PSA.36.6	Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.
PSA.36.6	Your judgements are like a great deep.
PSA.36.6	, you preserve man and animal.
PSA.36.7	How precious is your loving kindness, God!
PSA.36.7	The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.
PSA.36.8	They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house.
PSA.36.8	You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.
PSA.36.9	For with you is the spring of life.
PSA.36.9	In your light we will see light.
PSA.36.10	Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you,
PSA.36.10	your righteousness to the upright in heart.
PSA.36.11	Don’t let the foot of pride come against me.
PSA.36.11	Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.
PSA.36.12	There the workers of iniquity are fallen.
PSA.36.12	They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
PSA.37.1	Don’t fret because of evildoers,
PSA.37.1	neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.
PSA.37.2	For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,
PSA.37.2	and wither like the green herb.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.3	Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.
PSA.37.4	Also delight yourself in the 
PSA.37.4	and he will give you the desires of your heart.
PSA.37.5	Commit your way to the 
PSA.37.5	Trust also in him, and he will do this:
PSA.37.6	he will make your righteousness shine out like light,
PSA.37.6	and your justice as the noon day sun.
PSA.37.7	Rest in the 
PSA.37.7	Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his way,
PSA.37.7	because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.
PSA.37.8	Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.
PSA.37.8	Don’t fret; it leads only to evildoing.
PSA.37.9	For evildoers shall be cut off,
PSA.37.9	but those who wait for the 
PSA.37.10	For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.
PSA.37.10	Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t there.
PSA.37.11	But the humble shall inherit the land,
PSA.37.11	and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
PSA.37.12	The wicked plots against the just,
PSA.37.12	and gnashes at him with his teeth.
PSA.37.13	The Lord will laugh at him,
PSA.37.13	for he sees that his day is coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
PSA.37.14	to cast down the poor and needy,
PSA.37.14	to kill those who are upright on the path.
PSA.37.15	Their sword shall enter into their own heart.
PSA.37.15	Their bows shall be broken.
PSA.37.16	Better is a little that the righteous has,
PSA.37.16	than the abundance of many wicked.
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,
PSA.37.17	but the 
PSA.37.18	The 
PSA.37.18	Their inheritance shall be forever.
PSA.37.19	They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil.
PSA.37.19	In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked shall perish.
PSA.37.20	The enemies of the 
PSA.37.20	They will vanish—
PSA.37.20	vanish like smoke.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back,
PSA.37.21	but the righteous give generously.
PSA.37.22	For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.
PSA.37.22	Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.
PSA.37.23	A man’s steps are established by the 
PSA.37.23	He delights in his way.
PSA.37.24	Though he stumble, he shall not fall,
PSA.37.24	for the 
PSA.37.25	I have been young, and now am old,
PSA.37.25	yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,
PSA.37.25	nor his children begging for bread.
PSA.37.26	All day long he deals graciously, and lends.
PSA.37.26	His offspring is blessed.
PSA.37.27	Depart from evil, and do good.
PSA.37.27	Live securely forever.
PSA.37.28	For the 
PSA.37.28	and doesn’t forsake his saints.
PSA.37.28	They are preserved forever,
PSA.37.28	but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.29	The righteous shall inherit the land,
PSA.37.29	and live in it forever.
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.
PSA.37.30	His tongue speaks justice.
PSA.37.31	The law of his God is in his heart.
PSA.37.31	None of his steps shall slide.
PSA.37.32	The wicked watch the righteous,
PSA.37.32	and seek to kill him.
PSA.37.33	The 
PSA.37.33	nor condemn him when he is judged.
PSA.37.34	Wait for the 
PSA.37.34	and he will exalt you to inherit the land.
PSA.37.34	When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.
PSA.37.35	I have seen the wicked in great power,
PSA.37.35	spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.
PSA.37.36	But he passed away, and behold, he was not.
PSA.37.36	Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,
PSA.37.37	for there is a future for the man of peace.
PSA.37.38	As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.
PSA.37.38	The future of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA.37.39	But the salvation of the righteous is from the 
PSA.37.39	He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
PSA.37.40	The 
PSA.37.40	He rescues them from the wicked and saves them,
PSA.37.40	because they have taken refuge in him.
PSA.38.1	, don’t rebuke me in your wrath,
PSA.38.1	neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.
PSA.38.2	For your arrows have pierced me,
PSA.38.2	your hand presses hard on me.
PSA.38.3	There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,
PSA.38.3	neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	For my iniquities have gone over my head.
PSA.38.4	As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
PSA.38.5	My wounds are loathsome and corrupt
PSA.38.5	because of my foolishness.
PSA.38.6	I am in pain and bowed down greatly.
PSA.38.6	I go mourning all day long.
PSA.38.7	For my waist is filled with burning.
PSA.38.7	There is no soundness in my flesh.
PSA.38.8	I am faint and severely bruised.
PSA.38.8	I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.
PSA.38.9	Lord, all my desire is before you.
PSA.38.9	My groaning is not hidden from you.
PSA.38.10	My heart throbs.
PSA.38.10	My strength fails me.
PSA.38.10	As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.
PSA.38.11	My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague.
PSA.38.11	My kinsmen stand far away.
PSA.38.12	They also who seek after my life lay snares.
PSA.38.12	Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things,
PSA.38.12	and meditate deceits all day long.
PSA.38.13	But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear.
PSA.38.13	I am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth.
PSA.38.14	Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear,
PSA.38.14	in whose mouth are no reproofs.
PSA.38.15	For I hope in you, 
PSA.38.15	You will answer, Lord my God.
PSA.38.16	For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me,
PSA.38.16	or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.”
PSA.38.17	For I am ready to fall.
PSA.38.17	My pain is continually before me.
PSA.38.18	For I will declare my iniquity.
PSA.38.18	I will be sorry for my sin.
PSA.38.19	But my enemies are vigourous and many.
PSA.38.19	Those who hate me without reason are numerous.
PSA.38.20	They who render evil for good are also adversaries to me,
PSA.38.20	because I follow what is good.
PSA.38.21	Don’t forsake me, 
PSA.38.21	My God, don’t be far from me.
PSA.38.22	Hurry to help me,
PSA.38.22	Lord, my salvation.
PSA.39.1	I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my tongue.
PSA.39.1	I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.”
PSA.39.2	I was mute with silence.
PSA.39.2	I held my peace, even from good.
PSA.39.2	My sorrow was stirred.
PSA.39.3	My heart was hot within me.
PSA.39.3	While I meditated, the fire burnt.
PSA.39.3	I spoke with my tongue:
PSA.39.4	“
PSA.39.4	what is the measure of my days.
PSA.39.4	Let me know how frail I am.
PSA.39.5	Behold, you have made my days hand widths.
PSA.39.5	My lifetime is as nothing before you.
PSA.39.5	Surely every man stands as a breath.” 
PSA.39.6	“Surely every man walks like a shadow.
PSA.39.6	Surely they busy themselves in vain.
PSA.39.6	He heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather.
PSA.39.7	Now, Lord, what do I wait for?
PSA.39.7	My hope is in you.
PSA.39.8	Deliver me from all my transgressions.
PSA.39.8	Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish.
PSA.39.9	I was mute.
PSA.39.9	I didn’t open my mouth,
PSA.39.9	because you did it.
PSA.39.10	Remove your scourge away from me.
PSA.39.10	I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
PSA.39.11	When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity,
PSA.39.11	you consume his wealth like a moth.
PSA.39.11	Surely every man is but a breath.” 
PSA.39.12	“Hear my prayer, 
PSA.39.12	Don’t be silent at my tears.
PSA.39.12	For I am a stranger with you,
PSA.39.12	a foreigner, as all my fathers were.
PSA.39.13	Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,
PSA.39.13	before I go away and exist no more.”
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the 
PSA.40.1	He turned to me, and heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,
PSA.40.2	out of the miry clay.
PSA.40.2	He set my feet on a rock,
PSA.40.2	and gave me a firm place to stand.
PSA.40.3	He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.
PSA.40.3	Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the 
PSA.40.4	Blessed is the man who makes the 
PSA.40.4	and doesn’t respect the proud, nor such as turn away to lies.
PSA.40.5	Many, 
PSA.40.5	and your thoughts which are towards us.
PSA.40.5	They can’t be declared back to you.
PSA.40.5	If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted.
PSA.40.6	Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire.
PSA.40.6	You have opened my ears.
PSA.40.6	You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.
PSA.40.7	Then I said, “Behold, I have come.
PSA.40.7	It is written about me in the book in the scroll.
PSA.40.8	I delight to do your will, my God.
PSA.40.8	Yes, your law is within my heart.”
PSA.40.9	I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.
PSA.40.9	Behold, I will not seal my lips, 
PSA.40.10	I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.
PSA.40.10	I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.
PSA.40.10	I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.
PSA.40.11	Don’t withhold your tender mercies from me, 
PSA.40.11	Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.
PSA.40.12	For innumerable evils have surrounded me.
PSA.40.12	My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.
PSA.40.12	They are more than the hairs of my head.
PSA.40.12	My heart has failed me.
PSA.40.13	Be pleased, 
PSA.40.13	Hurry to help me, 
PSA.40.14	Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it.
PSA.40.14	Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonour who delight in my hurt.
PSA.40.15	Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, “Aha! Aha!”
PSA.40.16	Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
PSA.40.16	Let such as love your salvation say continually, “Let the 
PSA.40.17	But I am poor and needy.
PSA.40.17	May the Lord think about me.
PSA.40.17	You are my help and my deliverer.
PSA.40.17	Don’t delay, my God.
PSA.41.1	Blessed is he who considers the poor.
PSA.41.1	The 
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.2	He shall be blessed on the earth,
PSA.41.2	and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies.
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.3	and restore him from his bed of illness.
PSA.41.4	I said, “
PSA.41.4	Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
PSA.41.5	My enemies speak evil against me:
PSA.41.5	“When will he die, and his name perish?”
PSA.41.6	If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood.
PSA.41.6	His heart gathers iniquity to itself.
PSA.41.6	When he goes abroad, he tells it.
PSA.41.7	All who hate me whisper together against me.
PSA.41.7	They imagine the worst for me.
PSA.41.8	“An evil disease”, they say, “has afflicted him.
PSA.41.8	Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.”
PSA.41.9	Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,
PSA.41.9	who ate bread with me,
PSA.41.9	has lifted up his heel against me.
PSA.41.10	But you, 
PSA.41.10	that I may repay them.
PSA.41.11	By this I know that you delight in me,
PSA.41.11	because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me.
PSA.41.12	As for me, you uphold me in my integrity,
PSA.41.12	and set me in your presence forever.
PSA.41.13	Blessed be the 
PSA.41.13	from everlasting and to everlasting!
PSA.41.13	Amen and amen.
PSA.42.1	As the deer pants for the water brooks,
PSA.42.1	so my soul pants after you, God.
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
PSA.42.2	When shall I come and appear before God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my food day and night,
PSA.42.3	while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”
PSA.42.4	These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,
PSA.42.4	how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house,
PSA.42.4	with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day.
PSA.42.5	Why are you in despair, my soul?
PSA.42.5	Why are you disturbed within me?
PSA.42.5	Hope in God!
PSA.42.5	For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence.
PSA.42.6	My God, my soul is in despair within me.
PSA.42.6	Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan,
PSA.42.6	the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls.
PSA.42.7	All your waves and your billows have swept over me.
PSA.42.8	The 
PSA.42.8	In the night his song shall be with me:
PSA.42.8	a prayer to the God of my life.
PSA.42.9	I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”
PSA.42.10	As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me,
PSA.42.10	while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”
PSA.42.11	Why are you in despair, my soul?
PSA.42.11	Why are you disturbed within me?
PSA.42.11	Hope in God! For I shall still praise him,
PSA.42.11	the saving help of my countenance, and my God.
PSA.43.1	Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.
PSA.43.1	Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.
PSA.43.2	For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me?
PSA.43.2	Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.43.3	Oh, send out your light and your truth.
PSA.43.3	Let them lead me.
PSA.43.3	Let them bring me to your holy hill,
PSA.43.3	to your tents.
PSA.43.4	Then I will go to the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	to God, my exceeding joy.
PSA.43.4	I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.
PSA.43.5	Why are you in despair, my soul?
PSA.43.5	Why are you disturbed within me?
PSA.43.5	Hope in God!
PSA.43.5	For I shall still praise him:
PSA.43.5	my Saviour, my helper, and my God.
PSA.44.1	We have heard with our ears, God;
PSA.44.1	our fathers have told us what work you did in their days,
PSA.44.1	in the days of old.
PSA.44.2	You drove out the nations with your hand,
PSA.44.2	but you planted them.
PSA.44.2	You afflicted the peoples,
PSA.44.2	but you spread them abroad.
PSA.44.3	For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword,
PSA.44.3	neither did their own arm save them;
PSA.44.3	but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,
PSA.44.3	because you were favourable to them.
PSA.44.4	God, you are my King.
PSA.44.4	Command victories for Jacob!
PSA.44.5	Through you, we will push down our adversaries.
PSA.44.5	Through your name, we will tread down those who rise up against us.
PSA.44.6	For I will not trust in my bow,
PSA.44.6	neither will my sword save me.
PSA.44.7	But you have saved us from our adversaries,
PSA.44.7	and have shamed those who hate us.
PSA.44.8	In God we have made our boast all day long.
PSA.44.8	We will give thanks to your name forever. 
PSA.44.9	But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonour,
PSA.44.9	and don’t go out with our armies.
PSA.44.10	You make us turn back from the adversary.
PSA.44.10	Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.
PSA.44.11	You have made us like sheep for food,
PSA.44.11	and have scattered us amongst the nations.
PSA.44.12	You sell your people for nothing,
PSA.44.12	and have gained nothing from their sale.
PSA.44.13	You make us a reproach to our neighbours,
PSA.44.13	a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.
PSA.44.14	You make us a byword amongst the nations,
PSA.44.14	a shaking of the head amongst the peoples.
PSA.44.15	All day long my dishonour is before me,
PSA.44.15	and shame covers my face,
PSA.44.16	at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses,
PSA.44.16	because of the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this has come on us,
PSA.44.17	yet we haven’t forgotten you.
PSA.44.17	We haven’t been false to your covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our heart has not turned back,
PSA.44.18	neither have our steps strayed from your path,
PSA.44.19	though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals,
PSA.44.19	and covered us with the shadow of death.
PSA.44.20	If we have forgotten the name of our God,
PSA.44.20	or spread out our hands to a strange god,
PSA.44.21	won’t God search this out?
PSA.44.21	For he knows the secrets of the heart.
PSA.44.22	Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.
PSA.44.22	We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.
PSA.44.23	Wake up!
PSA.44.23	Why do you sleep, Lord?
PSA.44.23	Arise!
PSA.44.23	Don’t reject us forever.
PSA.44.24	Why do you hide your face,
PSA.44.24	and forget our affliction and our oppression?
PSA.44.25	For our soul is bowed down to the dust.
PSA.44.25	Our body clings to the earth.
PSA.44.26	Rise up to help us.
PSA.44.26	Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.
PSA.45.1	My heart overflows with a noble theme.
PSA.45.1	I recite my verses for the king.
PSA.45.1	My tongue is like the pen of a skilful writer.
PSA.45.2	You are the most excellent of the sons of men.
PSA.45.2	Grace has anointed your lips,
PSA.45.2	therefore God has blessed you forever.
PSA.45.3	Strap your sword on your thigh, mighty one:
PSA.45.3	your splendour and your majesty.
PSA.45.4	In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness.
PSA.45.4	Let your right hand display awesome deeds.
PSA.45.5	Your arrows are sharp.
PSA.45.5	The nations fall under you, with arrows in the heart of the king’s enemies.
PSA.45.6	Your throne, God, is forever and ever.
PSA.45.6	A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of your kingdom.
PSA.45.7	You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness.
PSA.45.7	Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.
PSA.45.8	All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia.
PSA.45.8	Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.
PSA.45.9	Kings’ daughters are amongst your honourable women.
PSA.45.9	At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear.
PSA.45.10	Forget your own people, and also your father’s house.
PSA.45.11	So the king will desire your beauty,
PSA.45.11	honour him, for he is your lord.
PSA.45.12	The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift.
PSA.45.12	The rich amongst the people entreat your favour.
PSA.45.13	The princess inside is all glorious.
PSA.45.13	Her clothing is interwoven with gold.
PSA.45.14	She shall be led to the king in embroidered work.
PSA.45.14	The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.
PSA.45.15	With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led.
PSA.45.15	They shall enter into the king’s palace.
PSA.45.16	Your sons will take the place of your fathers.
PSA.45.16	You shall make them princes in all the earth.
PSA.45.17	I will make your name to be remembered in all generations.
PSA.45.17	Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength,
PSA.46.1	a very present help in trouble.
PSA.46.2	Therefore we won’t be afraid, though the earth changes,
PSA.46.2	though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;
PSA.46.3	though its waters roar and are troubled,
PSA.46.3	though the mountains tremble with their swelling. 
PSA.46.4	There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad,
PSA.46.4	the holy place of the tents of the Most High.
PSA.46.5	God is within her. She shall not be moved.
PSA.46.5	God will help her at dawn.
PSA.46.6	The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved.
PSA.46.6	He lifted his voice and the earth melted.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.7	The God of Jacob is our refuge. 
PSA.46.8	Come, see the 
PSA.46.8	what desolations he has made in the earth.
PSA.46.9	He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.
PSA.46.9	He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear.
PSA.46.9	He burns the chariots in the fire.
PSA.46.10	“Be still, and know that I am God.
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted amongst the nations.
PSA.46.10	I will be exalted in the earth.”
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.46.11	The God of Jacob is our refuge. 
PSA.47.1	Oh clap your hands, all you nations.
PSA.47.1	Shout to God with the voice of triumph!
PSA.47.2	For the 
PSA.47.2	He is a great King over all the earth.
PSA.47.3	He subdues nations under us,
PSA.47.3	and peoples under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He chooses our inheritance for us,
PSA.47.4	the glory of Jacob whom he loved. 
PSA.47.5	God has gone up with a shout,
PSA.47.5	The 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God! Sing praises!
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to our King! Sing praises!
PSA.47.7	For God is the King of all the earth.
PSA.47.7	Sing praises with understanding.
PSA.47.8	God reigns over the nations.
PSA.47.8	God sits on his holy throne.
PSA.47.9	The princes of the peoples are gathered together,
PSA.47.9	the people of the God of Abraham.
PSA.47.9	For the shields of the earth belong to God.
PSA.47.9	He is greatly exalted!
PSA.48.1	Great is the 
PSA.48.1	in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
PSA.48.2	Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,
PSA.48.2	is Mount Zion, on the north sides,
PSA.48.2	the city of the great King.
PSA.48.3	God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge.
PSA.48.4	For, behold, the kings assembled themselves,
PSA.48.4	they passed by together.
PSA.48.5	They saw it, then they were amazed.
PSA.48.5	They were dismayed.
PSA.48.5	They hurried away.
PSA.48.6	Trembling took hold of them there,
PSA.48.6	pain, as of a woman in travail.
PSA.48.7	With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.
PSA.48.8	As we have heard, so we have seen,
PSA.48.8	in the city of the 
PSA.48.8	God will establish it forever. 
PSA.48.9	We have thought about your loving kindness, God,
PSA.48.9	in the middle of your temple.
PSA.48.10	As is your name, God,
PSA.48.10	so is your praise to the ends of the earth.
PSA.48.10	Your right hand is full of righteousness.
PSA.48.11	Let Mount Zion be glad!
PSA.48.11	Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgements.
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion, and go around her.
PSA.48.12	Number its towers.
PSA.48.13	Notice her bulwarks.
PSA.48.13	Consider her palaces,
PSA.48.13	that you may tell it to the next generation.
PSA.48.14	For this God is our God forever and ever.
PSA.48.14	He will be our guide even to death.
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all you peoples.
PSA.49.1	Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,
PSA.49.2	both low and high,
PSA.49.2	rich and poor together.
PSA.49.3	My mouth will speak words of wisdom.
PSA.49.3	My heart will utter understanding.
PSA.49.4	I will incline my ear to a proverb.
PSA.49.4	I will solve my riddle on the harp.
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear in the days of evil,
PSA.49.5	when iniquity at my heels surrounds me?
PSA.49.6	Those who trust in their wealth,
PSA.49.6	and boast in the multitude of their riches—
PSA.49.7	none of them can by any means redeem his brother,
PSA.49.7	nor give God a ransom for him.
PSA.49.8	For the redemption of their life is costly,
PSA.49.8	no payment is ever enough,
PSA.49.9	that he should live on forever,
PSA.49.9	that he should not see corruption.
PSA.49.10	For he sees that wise men die;
PSA.49.10	likewise the fool and the senseless perish,
PSA.49.10	and leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever,
PSA.49.11	and their dwelling places to all generations.
PSA.49.11	They name their lands after themselves.
PSA.49.12	But man, despite his riches, doesn’t endure.
PSA.49.12	He is like the animals that perish.
PSA.49.13	This is the destiny of those who are foolish,
PSA.49.13	and of those who approve their sayings. 
PSA.49.14	They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.
PSA.49.14	Death shall be their shepherd.
PSA.49.14	The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning.
PSA.49.14	Their beauty shall decay in Sheol,
PSA.49.14	far from their mansion.
PSA.49.15	But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,
PSA.49.15	for he will receive me. 
PSA.49.16	Don’t be afraid when a man is made rich,
PSA.49.16	when the glory of his house is increased;
PSA.49.17	for when he dies he will carry nothing away.
PSA.49.17	His glory won’t descend after him.
PSA.49.18	Though while he lived he blessed his soul—
PSA.49.18	and men praise you when you do well for yourself—
PSA.49.19	he shall go to the generation of his fathers.
PSA.49.19	They shall never see the light.
PSA.49.20	A man who has riches without understanding,
PSA.49.20	is like the animals that perish.
PSA.50.1	The Mighty One, God, The 
PSA.50.1	and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.
PSA.50.2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
PSA.50.2	God shines out.
PSA.50.3	Our God comes, and does not keep silent.
PSA.50.3	A fire devours before him.
PSA.50.3	It is very stormy around him.
PSA.50.4	He calls to the heavens above,
PSA.50.4	to the earth, that he may judge his people:
PSA.50.5	“Gather my saints together to me,
PSA.50.5	those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”
PSA.50.6	The heavens shall declare his righteousness,
PSA.50.6	for God himself is judge. 
PSA.50.7	“Hear, my people, and I will speak.
PSA.50.7	Israel, I will testify against you.
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God.
PSA.50.8	I don’t rebuke you for your sacrifices.
PSA.50.8	Your burnt offerings are continually before me.
PSA.50.9	I have no need for a bull from your stall,
PSA.50.9	nor male goats from your pens.
PSA.50.10	For every animal of the forest is mine,
PSA.50.10	and the livestock on a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know all the birds of the mountains.
PSA.50.11	The wild animals of the field are mine.
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
PSA.50.12	for the world is mine, and all that is in it.
PSA.50.13	Will I eat the meat of bulls,
PSA.50.13	or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving.
PSA.50.14	Pay your vows to the Most High.
PSA.50.15	Call on me in the day of trouble.
PSA.50.15	I will deliver you, and you will honour me.”
PSA.50.16	But to the wicked God says,
PSA.50.16	“What right do you have to declare my statutes,
PSA.50.16	that you have taken my covenant on your lips,
PSA.50.17	since you hate instruction,
PSA.50.17	and throw my words behind you?
PSA.50.18	When you saw a thief, you consented with him,
PSA.50.18	and have participated with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	“You give your mouth to evil.
PSA.50.19	Your tongue frames deceit.
PSA.50.20	You sit and speak against your brother.
PSA.50.20	You slander your own mother’s son.
PSA.50.21	You have done these things, and I kept silent.
PSA.50.21	You thought that I was just like you.
PSA.50.21	I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.
PSA.50.22	“Now consider this, you who forget God,
PSA.50.22	lest I tear you into pieces, and there be no one to deliver.
PSA.50.23	Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me,
PSA.50.23	and prepares his way so that I will show God’s salvation to him.”
PSA.51.1	Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness.
PSA.51.1	According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
PSA.51.2	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.
PSA.51.2	Cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I know my transgressions.
PSA.51.3	My sin is constantly before me.
PSA.51.4	Against you, and you only, I have sinned,
PSA.51.4	and done that which is evil in your sight,
PSA.51.4	so you may be proved right when you speak,
PSA.51.4	and justified when you judge.
PSA.51.5	Behold, I was born in iniquity.
PSA.51.5	My mother conceived me in sin.
PSA.51.6	Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts.
PSA.51.6	You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
PSA.51.7	Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.
PSA.51.7	Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Let me hear joy and gladness,
PSA.51.8	that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.
PSA.51.9	Hide your face from my sins,
PSA.51.9	and blot out all of my iniquities.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a clean heart, O God.
PSA.51.10	Renew a right spirit within me.
PSA.51.11	Don’t throw me from your presence,
PSA.51.11	and don’t take your Holy Spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	Restore to me the joy of your salvation.
PSA.51.12	Uphold me with a willing spirit.
PSA.51.13	Then I will teach transgressors your ways.
PSA.51.13	Sinners will be converted to you.
PSA.51.14	Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation.
PSA.51.14	My tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.
PSA.51.15	Lord, open my lips.
PSA.51.15	My mouth will declare your praise.
PSA.51.16	For you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.
PSA.51.16	You have no pleasure in burnt offering.
PSA.51.17	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.
PSA.51.17	O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart.
PSA.51.18	Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.
PSA.51.18	Build the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
PSA.51.19	in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings.
PSA.51.19	Then they will offer bulls on your altar.
PSA.52.1	Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?
PSA.52.1	God’s loving kindness endures continually.
PSA.52.2	Your tongue plots destruction,
PSA.52.2	like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
PSA.52.3	You love evil more than good,
PSA.52.3	lying rather than speaking the truth. 
PSA.52.4	You love all devouring words,
PSA.52.4	you deceitful tongue.
PSA.52.5	God will likewise destroy you forever.
PSA.52.5	He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent,
PSA.52.5	and root you out of the land of the living. 
PSA.52.6	The righteous also will see it, and fear,
PSA.52.6	and laugh at him, saying,
PSA.52.7	“Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength,
PSA.52.7	but trusted in the abundance of his riches,
PSA.52.7	and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”
PSA.52.8	But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house.
PSA.52.8	I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it.
PSA.52.9	I will hope in your name, for it is good,
PSA.52.9	in the presence of your saints.
PSA.53.1	The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”
PSA.53.1	They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity.
PSA.53.1	There is no one who does good.
PSA.53.2	God looks down from heaven on the children of men,
PSA.53.2	to see if there are any who understood,
PSA.53.2	who seek after God.
PSA.53.3	Every one of them has gone back.
PSA.53.3	They have become filthy together.
PSA.53.3	There is no one who does good, no, not one.
PSA.53.4	Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,
PSA.53.4	who eat up my people as they eat bread,
PSA.53.4	and don’t call on God?
PSA.53.5	There they were in great fear, where no fear was,
PSA.53.5	for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you.
PSA.53.5	You have put them to shame,
PSA.53.5	because God has rejected them.
PSA.53.6	Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!
PSA.53.6	When God brings back his people from captivity,
PSA.53.6	then Jacob shall rejoice,
PSA.53.6	and Israel shall be glad.
PSA.54.1	Save me, God, by your name.
PSA.54.1	Vindicate me in your might.
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, God.
PSA.54.2	Listen to the words of my mouth.
PSA.54.3	For strangers have risen up against me.
PSA.54.3	Violent men have sought after my soul.
PSA.54.3	They haven’t set God before them. 
PSA.54.4	Behold, God is my helper.
PSA.54.4	The Lord is the one who sustains my soul.
PSA.54.5	He will repay the evil to my enemies.
PSA.54.5	Destroy them in your truth.
PSA.54.6	With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you.
PSA.54.6	I will give thanks to your name, 
PSA.54.7	For he has delivered me out of all trouble.
PSA.54.7	My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.
PSA.55.1	Listen to my prayer, God.
PSA.55.1	Don’t hide yourself from my supplication.
PSA.55.2	Attend to me, and answer me.
PSA.55.2	I am restless in my complaint,
PSA.55.2	and moan 
PSA.55.3	because of the voice of the enemy,
PSA.55.3	because of the oppression of the wicked.
PSA.55.3	For they bring suffering on me.
PSA.55.3	In anger they hold a grudge against me.
PSA.55.4	My heart is severely pained within me.
PSA.55.4	The terrors of death have fallen on me.
PSA.55.5	Fearfulness and trembling have come on me.
PSA.55.5	Horror has overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove!
PSA.55.6	Then I would fly away, and be at rest.
PSA.55.7	Behold, then I would wander far off.
PSA.55.7	I would lodge in the wilderness.” 
PSA.55.8	“I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm.”
PSA.55.9	Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language,
PSA.55.9	for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
PSA.55.10	Day and night they prowl around on its walls.
PSA.55.10	Malice and abuse are also within her.
PSA.55.11	Destructive forces are within her.
PSA.55.11	Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets.
PSA.55.12	For it was not an enemy who insulted me,
PSA.55.12	then I could have endured it.
PSA.55.12	Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,
PSA.55.12	then I would have hidden myself from him.
PSA.55.13	But it was you, a man like me,
PSA.55.13	my companion, and my familiar friend.
PSA.55.14	We took sweet fellowship together.
PSA.55.14	We walked in God’s house with company.
PSA.55.15	Let death come suddenly on them.
PSA.55.15	Let them go down alive into Sheol.
PSA.55.15	For wickedness is amongst them, in their dwelling.
PSA.55.16	As for me, I will call on God.
PSA.55.16	The 
PSA.55.17	Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress.
PSA.55.17	He will hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me,
PSA.55.18	although there are many who oppose me.
PSA.55.19	God, who is enthroned forever,
PSA.55.19	will hear and answer them. 
PSA.55.19	They never change
PSA.55.19	and don’t fear God.
PSA.55.20	He raises his hands against his friends.
PSA.55.20	He has violated his covenant.
PSA.55.21	His mouth was smooth as butter,
PSA.55.21	but his heart was war.
PSA.55.21	His words were softer than oil,
PSA.55.21	yet they were drawn swords.
PSA.55.22	Cast your burden on the 
PSA.55.22	He will never allow the righteous to be moved.
PSA.55.23	But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction.
PSA.55.23	Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,
PSA.55.23	but I will trust in you.
PSA.56.1	Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up.
PSA.56.1	All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.
PSA.56.2	My enemies want to swallow me up all day long,
PSA.56.2	for they are many who fight proudly against me.
PSA.56.3	When I am afraid,
PSA.56.3	I will put my trust in you.
PSA.56.4	In God, I praise his word.
PSA.56.4	In God, I put my trust.
PSA.56.4	I will not be afraid.
PSA.56.4	What can flesh do to me?
PSA.56.5	All day long they twist my words.
PSA.56.5	All their thoughts are against me for evil.
PSA.56.6	They conspire and lurk,
PSA.56.6	watching my steps.
PSA.56.6	They are eager to take my life.
PSA.56.7	Shall they escape by iniquity?
PSA.56.7	In anger cast down the peoples, God.
PSA.56.8	You count my wanderings.
PSA.56.8	You put my tears into your container.
PSA.56.8	Aren’t they in your book?
PSA.56.9	Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call.
PSA.56.9	I know this: that God is for me.
PSA.56.10	In God, I will praise his word.
PSA.56.10	In the 
PSA.56.11	I have put my trust in God.
PSA.56.11	I will not be afraid.
PSA.56.11	What can man do to me?
PSA.56.12	Your vows are on me, God.
PSA.56.12	I will give thank offerings to you.
PSA.56.13	For you have delivered my soul from death,
PSA.56.13	and prevented my feet from falling,
PSA.56.13	that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
PSA.57.1	Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,
PSA.57.1	for my soul takes refuge in you.
PSA.57.1	Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge,
PSA.57.1	until disaster has passed.
PSA.57.2	I cry out to God Most High,
PSA.57.2	to God who accomplishes my requests for me.
PSA.57.3	He will send from heaven, and save me,
PSA.57.3	he rebukes the one who is pursuing me. 
PSA.57.3	God will send out his loving kindness and his truth.
PSA.57.4	My soul is amongst lions.
PSA.57.4	I lie amongst those who are set on fire,
PSA.57.4	even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
PSA.57.4	and their tongue a sharp sword.
PSA.57.5	Be exalted, God, above the heavens!
PSA.57.5	Let your glory be above all the earth!
PSA.57.6	They have prepared a net for my steps.
PSA.57.6	My soul is bowed down.
PSA.57.6	They dig a pit before me.
PSA.57.6	They fall into the middle of it themselves. 
PSA.57.7	My heart is steadfast, God.
PSA.57.7	My heart is steadfast.
PSA.57.7	I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.
PSA.57.8	Wake up, my glory! Wake up, lute and harp!
PSA.57.8	I will wake up the dawn.
PSA.57.9	I will give thanks to you, Lord, amongst the peoples.
PSA.57.9	I will sing praises to you amongst the nations.
PSA.57.10	For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens,
PSA.57.10	and your truth to the skies.
PSA.57.11	Be exalted, God, above the heavens.
PSA.57.11	Let your glory be over all the earth.
PSA.58.1	Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones?
PSA.58.1	Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?
PSA.58.2	No, in your heart you plot injustice.
PSA.58.2	You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth.
PSA.58.3	The wicked go astray from the womb.
PSA.58.3	They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
PSA.58.4	Their poison is like the poison of a snake,
PSA.58.4	like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,
PSA.58.5	which doesn’t listen to the voice of charmers,
PSA.58.5	no matter how skilful the charmer may be.
PSA.58.6	Break their teeth, God, in their mouth.
PSA.58.6	Break out the great teeth of the young lions, 
PSA.58.7	Let them vanish like water that flows away.
PSA.58.7	When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.
PSA.58.8	Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away,
PSA.58.8	like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.
PSA.58.9	Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns,
PSA.58.9	he will sweep away the green and the burning alike.
PSA.58.10	The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.
PSA.58.10	He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,
PSA.58.11	so that men shall say, “Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous.
PSA.58.11	Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth.”
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from my enemies, my God.
PSA.59.1	Set me on high from those who rise up against me.
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.
PSA.59.2	Save me from the bloodthirsty men.
PSA.59.3	For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul.
PSA.59.3	The mighty gather themselves together against me,
PSA.59.3	not for my disobedience, nor for my sin, 
PSA.59.4	I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.
PSA.59.4	Rise up, behold, and help me!
PSA.59.5	You, 
PSA.59.5	rouse yourself to punish the nations.
PSA.59.5	Show no mercy to the wicked traitors. 
PSA.59.6	They return at evening, howling like dogs,
PSA.59.6	and prowl around the city.
PSA.59.7	Behold, they spew with their mouth.
PSA.59.7	Swords are in their lips,
PSA.59.7	“For”, they say, “who hears us?”
PSA.59.8	But you, 
PSA.59.8	You scoff at all the nations.
PSA.59.9	Oh, my Strength, I watch for you,
PSA.59.9	for God is my high tower.
PSA.59.10	My God will go before me with his loving kindness.
PSA.59.10	God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.
PSA.59.11	Don’t kill them, or my people may forget.
PSA.59.11	Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield.
PSA.59.12	For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,
PSA.59.12	let them be caught in their pride,
PSA.59.12	for the curses and lies which they utter.
PSA.59.13	Consume them in wrath.
PSA.59.13	Consume them, and they will be no more.
PSA.59.13	Let them know that God rules in Jacob,
PSA.59.13	to the ends of the earth. 
PSA.59.14	At evening let them return.
PSA.59.14	Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.
PSA.59.15	They shall wander up and down for food,
PSA.59.15	and wait all night if they aren’t satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing of your strength.
PSA.59.16	Yes, I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning.
PSA.59.16	For you have been my high tower,
PSA.59.16	a refuge in the day of my distress.
PSA.59.17	To you, my strength, I will sing praises.
PSA.59.17	For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
PSA.60.1	God, you have rejected us.
PSA.60.1	You have broken us down.
PSA.60.1	You have been angry.
PSA.60.1	Restore us, again.
PSA.60.2	You have made the land tremble.
PSA.60.2	You have torn it.
PSA.60.2	Mend its fractures,
PSA.60.2	for it quakes.
PSA.60.3	You have shown your people hard things.
PSA.60.3	You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.
PSA.60.4	You have given a banner to those who fear you,
PSA.60.4	that it may be displayed because of the truth. 
PSA.60.5	So that your beloved may be delivered,
PSA.60.5	save with your right hand, and answer us.
PSA.60.6	God has spoken from his sanctuary:
PSA.60.6	“I will triumph.
PSA.60.6	I will divide Shechem,
PSA.60.6	and measure out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine.
PSA.60.7	Ephraim also is the defence of my head.
PSA.60.7	Judah is my sceptre.
PSA.60.8	Moab is my wash basin.
PSA.60.8	I will throw my sandal on Edom.
PSA.60.8	I shout in triumph over Philistia.”
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me into the strong city?
PSA.60.9	Who has led me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	Haven’t you, God, rejected us?
PSA.60.10	You don’t go out with our armies, God.
PSA.60.11	Give us help against the adversary,
PSA.60.11	for the help of man is vain.
PSA.60.12	Through God we will do valiantly,
PSA.60.12	for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, God.
PSA.61.1	Listen to my prayer.
PSA.61.2	From the end of the earth, I will call to you when my heart is overwhelmed.
PSA.61.2	Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
PSA.61.3	For you have been a refuge for me,
PSA.61.3	a strong tower from the enemy.
PSA.61.4	I will dwell in your tent forever.
PSA.61.4	I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings. 
PSA.61.5	For you, God, have heard my vows.
PSA.61.5	You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
PSA.61.6	You will prolong the king’s life.
PSA.61.6	His years will be for generations.
PSA.61.7	He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever.
PSA.61.7	Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
PSA.61.8	So I will sing praise to your name forever,
PSA.61.8	that I may fulfil my vows daily.
PSA.62.1	My soul rests in God alone.
PSA.62.1	My salvation is from him.
PSA.62.2	He alone is my rock, my salvation, and my fortress.
PSA.62.2	I will never be greatly shaken.
PSA.62.3	How long will you assault a man?
PSA.62.3	Would all of you throw him down,
PSA.62.3	like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
PSA.62.4	They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place.
PSA.62.4	They delight in lies.
PSA.62.4	They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. 
PSA.62.5	My soul, wait in silence for God alone,
PSA.62.5	for my expectation is from him.
PSA.62.6	He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress.
PSA.62.6	I will not be shaken.
PSA.62.7	My salvation and my honour is with God.
PSA.62.7	The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
PSA.62.8	Trust in him at all times, you people.
PSA.62.8	Pour out your heart before him.
PSA.62.8	God is a refuge for us. 
PSA.62.9	Surely men of low degree are just a breath,
PSA.62.9	and men of high degree are a lie.
PSA.62.9	In the balances they will go up.
PSA.62.9	They are together lighter than a breath.
PSA.62.10	Don’t trust in oppression.
PSA.62.10	Don’t become vain in robbery.
PSA.62.10	If riches increase,
PSA.62.10	don’t set your heart on them.
PSA.62.11	God has spoken once;
PSA.62.11	twice I have heard this,
PSA.62.11	that power belongs to God.
PSA.62.12	Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness,
PSA.62.12	for you reward every man according to his work.
PSA.63.1	God, you are my God.
PSA.63.1	I will earnestly seek you.
PSA.63.1	My soul thirsts for you.
PSA.63.1	My flesh longs for you,
PSA.63.1	in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.
PSA.63.2	So I have seen you in the sanctuary,
PSA.63.2	watching your power and your glory.
PSA.63.3	Because your loving kindness is better than life,
PSA.63.3	my lips shall praise you.
PSA.63.4	So I will bless you while I live.
PSA.63.4	I will lift up my hands in your name.
PSA.63.5	My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food.
PSA.63.5	My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,
PSA.63.6	when I remember you on my bed,
PSA.63.6	and think about you in the night watches.
PSA.63.7	For you have been my help.
PSA.63.7	I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.
PSA.63.8	My soul stays close to you.
PSA.63.8	Your right hand holds me up.
PSA.63.9	But those who seek my soul to destroy it
PSA.63.9	shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
PSA.63.10	They shall be given over to the power of the sword.
PSA.63.10	They shall be jackal food.
PSA.63.11	But the king shall rejoice in God.
PSA.63.11	Everyone who swears by him will praise him,
PSA.63.11	for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, God, in my complaint.
PSA.64.1	Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked,
PSA.64.2	from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil;
PSA.64.3	who sharpen their tongue like a sword,
PSA.64.3	and aim their arrows, deadly words,
PSA.64.4	to shoot innocent men from ambushes.
PSA.64.4	They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly.
PSA.64.5	They encourage themselves in evil plans.
PSA.64.5	They talk about laying snares secretly.
PSA.64.5	They say, “Who will see them?”
PSA.64.6	They plot injustice, saying, “We have made a perfect plan!”
PSA.64.6	Surely man’s mind and heart are cunning.
PSA.64.7	But God will shoot at them.
PSA.64.7	They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow.
PSA.64.8	Their own tongues shall ruin them.
PSA.64.8	All who see them will shake their heads.
PSA.64.9	All mankind shall be afraid.
PSA.64.9	They shall declare the work of God,
PSA.64.9	and shall wisely ponder what he has done.
PSA.64.10	The righteous shall be glad in the 
PSA.64.10	and shall take refuge in him.
PSA.64.10	All the upright in heart shall praise him!
PSA.65.1	Praise waits for you, God, in Zion.
PSA.65.1	Vows shall be performed to you.
PSA.65.2	You who hear prayer,
PSA.65.2	all men will come to you.
PSA.65.3	Sins overwhelmed me,
PSA.65.3	but you atoned for our transgressions.
PSA.65.4	Blessed is the one whom you choose and cause to come near,
PSA.65.4	that he may live in your courts.
PSA.65.4	We will be filled with the goodness of your house,
PSA.65.4	your holy temple.
PSA.65.5	By awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us,
PSA.65.5	God of our salvation.
PSA.65.5	You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth,
PSA.65.5	of those who are far away on the sea.
PSA.65.6	By your power, you form the mountains,
PSA.65.6	having armed yourself with strength.
PSA.65.7	You still the roaring of the seas,
PSA.65.7	the roaring of their waves,
PSA.65.7	and the turmoil of the nations.
PSA.65.8	They also who dwell in faraway places are afraid at your wonders.
PSA.65.8	You call the morning’s dawn and the evening with songs of joy.
PSA.65.9	You visit the earth, and water it.
PSA.65.9	You greatly enrich it.
PSA.65.9	The river of God is full of water.
PSA.65.9	You provide them grain, for so you have ordained it.
PSA.65.10	You drench its furrows.
PSA.65.10	You level its ridges.
PSA.65.10	You soften it with showers.
PSA.65.10	You bless it with a crop.
PSA.65.11	You crown the year with your bounty.
PSA.65.11	Your carts overflow with abundance.
PSA.65.12	The wilderness grasslands overflow.
PSA.65.12	The hills are clothed with gladness.
PSA.65.13	The pastures are covered with flocks.
PSA.65.13	The valleys also are clothed with grain.
PSA.65.13	They shout for joy!
PSA.65.13	They also sing.
PSA.66.1	Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth!
PSA.66.2	Sing to the glory of his name!
PSA.66.2	Offer glory and praise!
PSA.66.3	Tell God, “How awesome are your deeds!
PSA.66.3	Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you.
PSA.66.4	All the earth will worship you,
PSA.66.4	and will sing to you;
PSA.66.4	they will sing to your name.” 
PSA.66.5	Come, and see God’s deeds—
PSA.66.5	awesome work on behalf of the children of men.
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land.
PSA.66.6	They went through the river on foot.
PSA.66.6	There, we rejoiced in him.
PSA.66.7	He rules by his might forever.
PSA.66.7	His eyes watch the nations.
PSA.66.7	Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him. 
PSA.66.8	Praise our God, you peoples!
PSA.66.8	Make the sound of his praise heard,
PSA.66.9	who preserves our life amongst the living,
PSA.66.9	and doesn’t allow our feet to be moved.
PSA.66.10	For you, God, have tested us.
PSA.66.10	You have refined us, as silver is refined.
PSA.66.11	You brought us into prison.
PSA.66.11	You laid a burden on our backs.
PSA.66.12	You allowed men to ride over our heads.
PSA.66.12	We went through fire and through water,
PSA.66.12	but you brought us to the place of abundance.
PSA.66.13	I will come into your temple with burnt offerings.
PSA.66.13	I will pay my vows to you, 
PSA.66.14	which my lips promised,
PSA.66.14	and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.
PSA.66.15	I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals,
PSA.66.15	with the offering of rams,
PSA.66.15	I will offer bulls with goats. 
PSA.66.16	Come and hear, all you who fear God.
PSA.66.16	I will declare what he has done for my soul.
PSA.66.17	I cried to him with my mouth.
PSA.66.17	He was extolled with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I cherished sin in my heart,
PSA.66.18	the Lord wouldn’t have listened.
PSA.66.19	But most certainly, God has listened.
PSA.66.19	He has heard the voice of my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer,
PSA.66.20	nor his loving kindness from me.
PSA.67.1	May God be merciful to us, bless us,
PSA.67.1	and cause his face to shine on us. 
PSA.67.2	That your way may be known on earth,
PSA.67.2	and your salvation amongst all nations,
PSA.67.3	let the peoples praise you, God.
PSA.67.3	Let all the peoples praise you.
PSA.67.4	Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy,
PSA.67.4	for you will judge the peoples with equity,
PSA.67.4	and govern the nations on earth. 
PSA.67.5	Let the peoples praise you, God.
PSA.67.5	Let all the peoples praise you.
PSA.67.6	The earth has yielded its increase.
PSA.67.6	God, even our own God, will bless us.
PSA.67.7	God will bless us.
PSA.67.7	All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
PSA.68.1	Let God arise!
PSA.68.1	Let his enemies be scattered!
PSA.68.1	Let them who hate him also flee before him.
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driven away,
PSA.68.2	so drive them away.
PSA.68.2	As wax melts before the fire,
PSA.68.2	so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
PSA.68.3	But let the righteous be glad.
PSA.68.3	Let them rejoice before God.
PSA.68.3	Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.
PSA.68.4	Sing to God! Sing praises to his name!
PSA.68.4	Extol him who rides on the clouds:
PSA.68.4	to the 
PSA.68.4	Rejoice before him!
PSA.68.5	A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows,
PSA.68.5	is God in his holy habitation.
PSA.68.6	God sets the lonely in families.
PSA.68.6	He brings out the prisoners with singing,
PSA.68.6	but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.
PSA.68.7	God, when you went out before your people,
PSA.68.7	when you marched through the wilderness... 
PSA.68.8	The earth trembled.
PSA.68.8	The sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai—
PSA.68.8	at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	You, God, sent a plentiful rain.
PSA.68.9	You confirmed your inheritance when it was weary.
PSA.68.10	Your congregation lived therein.
PSA.68.10	You, God, prepared your goodness for the poor.
PSA.68.11	The Lord announced the word.
PSA.68.11	The ones who proclaim it are a great company.
PSA.68.12	“Kings of armies flee! They flee!”
PSA.68.12	She who waits at home divides the plunder,
PSA.68.13	while you sleep amongst the camp fires,
PSA.68.13	the wings of a dove sheathed with silver,
PSA.68.13	her feathers with shining gold.
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered kings in her,
PSA.68.14	it snowed on Zalmon.
PSA.68.15	The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains.
PSA.68.15	The mountains of Bashan are rugged.
PSA.68.16	Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains,
PSA.68.16	at the mountain where God chooses to reign?
PSA.68.16	Yes, the 
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands.
PSA.68.17	The Lord is amongst them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary.
PSA.68.18	You have ascended on high.
PSA.68.18	You have led away captives.
PSA.68.18	You have received gifts amongst people,
PSA.68.18	yes, amongst the rebellious also, that the 
PSA.68.19	Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens,
PSA.68.19	even the God who is our salvation. 
PSA.68.20	God is to us a God of deliverance.
PSA.68.20	To the 
PSA.68.21	But God will strike through the head of his enemies,
PSA.68.21	the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness.
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, “I will bring you again from Bashan,
PSA.68.22	I will bring you again from the depths of the sea,
PSA.68.23	that you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood,
PSA.68.23	that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies.”
PSA.68.24	They have seen your processions, God,
PSA.68.24	even the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,
PSA.68.25	amongst the ladies playing with tambourines,
PSA.68.26	“Bless God in the congregations,
PSA.68.26	even the Lord in the assembly of Israel!”
PSA.68.27	There is little Benjamin, their ruler,
PSA.68.27	the princes of Judah, their council,
PSA.68.27	the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Your God has commanded your strength.
PSA.68.28	Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us.
PSA.68.29	Because of your temple at Jerusalem,
PSA.68.29	kings shall bring presents to you.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds,
PSA.68.30	the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples.
PSA.68.30	Being humbled, may it bring bars of silver.
PSA.68.30	Scatter the nations that delight in war.
PSA.68.31	Princes shall come out of Egypt.
PSA.68.31	Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God.
PSA.68.32	Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!
PSA.68.32	Sing praises to the Lord— 
PSA.68.33	to him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old;
PSA.68.33	behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.
PSA.68.34	Ascribe strength to God!
PSA.68.34	His excellency is over Israel,
PSA.68.34	his strength is in the skies.
PSA.68.35	You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries.
PSA.68.35	The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.
PSA.68.35	Praise be to God!
PSA.69.1	Save me, God,
PSA.69.1	for the waters have come up to my neck!
PSA.69.2	I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.
PSA.69.2	I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
PSA.69.3	I am weary with my crying.
PSA.69.3	My throat is dry.
PSA.69.3	My eyes fail looking for my God.
PSA.69.4	Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head.
PSA.69.4	Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty.
PSA.69.4	I have to restore what I didn’t take away.
PSA.69.5	God, you know my foolishness.
PSA.69.5	My sins aren’t hidden from you.
PSA.69.6	Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord GOD of Armies.
PSA.69.6	Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonour through me, God of Israel.
PSA.69.7	Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.
PSA.69.7	Shame has covered my face.
PSA.69.8	I have become a stranger to my brothers,
PSA.69.8	an alien to my mother’s children.
PSA.69.9	For the zeal of your house consumes me.
PSA.69.9	The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.
PSA.69.10	When I wept and I fasted,
PSA.69.10	that was to my reproach.
PSA.69.11	When I made sackcloth my clothing,
PSA.69.11	I became a byword to them.
PSA.69.12	Those who sit in the gate talk about me.
PSA.69.12	I am the song of the drunkards.
PSA.69.13	But as for me, my prayer is to you, 
PSA.69.13	God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.
PSA.69.14	Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink.
PSA.69.14	Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me,
PSA.69.15	neither let the deep swallow me up.
PSA.69.15	Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me.
PSA.69.16	Answer me, 
PSA.69.16	According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.
PSA.69.17	Don’t hide your face from your servant,
PSA.69.17	for I am in distress.
PSA.69.17	Answer me speedily!
PSA.69.18	Draw near to my soul and redeem it.
PSA.69.18	Ransom me because of my enemies.
PSA.69.19	You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonour.
PSA.69.19	My adversaries are all before you.
PSA.69.20	Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.
PSA.69.20	I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;
PSA.69.20	for comforters, but I found none.
PSA.69.21	They also gave me poison for my food.
PSA.69.21	In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	Let their table before them become a snare.
PSA.69.22	May it become a retribution and a trap.
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see.
PSA.69.23	Let their backs be continually bent.
PSA.69.24	Pour out your indignation on them.
PSA.69.24	Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
PSA.69.25	Let their habitation be desolate.
PSA.69.25	Let no one dwell in their tents.
PSA.69.26	For they persecute him whom you have wounded.
PSA.69.26	They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.
PSA.69.27	Charge them with crime upon crime.
PSA.69.27	Don’t let them come into your righteousness.
PSA.69.28	Let them be blotted out of the book of life,
PSA.69.28	and not be written with the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But I am in pain and distress.
PSA.69.29	Let your salvation, God, protect me.
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God with a song,
PSA.69.30	and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.31	It will please the 
PSA.69.31	or a bull that has horns and hoofs.
PSA.69.32	The humble have seen it, and are glad.
PSA.69.32	You who seek after God, let your heart live.
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.33	and doesn’t despise his captive people.
PSA.69.34	Let heaven and earth praise him;
PSA.69.34	the seas, and everything that moves therein!
PSA.69.35	For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.
PSA.69.35	They shall settle there, and own it.
PSA.69.36	The children also of his servants shall inherit it.
PSA.69.36	Those who love his name shall dwell therein.
PSA.70.1	Hurry, God, to deliver me.
PSA.70.1	Come quickly to help me, 
PSA.70.2	Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul.
PSA.70.2	Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
PSA.70.3	Let them be turned because of their shame
PSA.70.3	who say, “Aha! Aha!”
PSA.70.4	Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
PSA.70.4	Let those who love your salvation continually say,
PSA.70.4	“Let God be exalted!”
PSA.70.5	But I am poor and needy.
PSA.70.5	Come to me quickly, God.
PSA.70.5	You are my help and my deliverer.
PSA.70.5	, don’t delay.
PSA.71.1	In you, 
PSA.71.1	Never let me be disappointed.
PSA.71.2	Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.
PSA.71.2	Turn your ear to me, and save me.
PSA.71.3	Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.
PSA.71.3	Give the command to save me,
PSA.71.3	for you are my rock and my fortress.
PSA.71.4	Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,
PSA.71.4	from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
PSA.71.5	For you are my hope, Lord GOD,
PSA.71.5	my confidence from my youth.
PSA.71.6	I have relied on you from the womb.
PSA.71.6	You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb.
PSA.71.6	I will always praise you.
PSA.71.7	I am a marvel to many,
PSA.71.7	but you are my strong refuge.
PSA.71.8	My mouth shall be filled with your praise,
PSA.71.8	with your honour all day long.
PSA.71.9	Don’t reject me in my old age.
PSA.71.9	Don’t forsake me when my strength fails.
PSA.71.10	For my enemies talk about me.
PSA.71.10	Those who watch for my soul conspire together,
PSA.71.11	saying, “God has forsaken him.
PSA.71.11	Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him.”
PSA.71.12	God, don’t be far from me.
PSA.71.12	My God, hurry to help me.
PSA.71.13	Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed.
PSA.71.13	Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.
PSA.71.14	But I will always hope,
PSA.71.14	and will add to all of your praise.
PSA.71.15	My mouth will tell about your righteousness,
PSA.71.15	and of your salvation all day,
PSA.71.15	though I don’t know its full measure.
PSA.71.16	I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord GOD.
PSA.71.16	I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.
PSA.71.17	God, you have taught me from my youth.
PSA.71.17	Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.
PSA.71.18	Yes, even when I am old and grey-haired, God, don’t forsake me,
PSA.71.18	until I have declared your strength to the next generation,
PSA.71.18	your might to everyone who is to come.
PSA.71.19	God, your righteousness also reaches to the heavens.
PSA.71.19	You have done great things.
PSA.71.19	God, who is like you?
PSA.71.20	You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles,
PSA.71.20	you will let me live.
PSA.71.20	You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.
PSA.71.21	Increase my honour
PSA.71.21	and comfort me again.
PSA.71.22	I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God.
PSA.71.22	I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	My lips shall shout for joy!
PSA.71.23	My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!
PSA.71.24	My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long,
PSA.71.24	for they are disappointed, and they are confounded,
PSA.71.24	who want to harm me.
PSA.72.1	God, give the king your justice;
PSA.72.1	your righteousness to the royal son.
PSA.72.2	He will judge your people with righteousness,
PSA.72.2	and your poor with justice.
PSA.72.3	The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people.
PSA.72.3	The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.
PSA.72.4	He will judge the poor of the people.
PSA.72.4	He will save the children of the needy,
PSA.72.4	and will break the oppressor in pieces.
PSA.72.5	They shall fear you while the sun endures;
PSA.72.5	and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
PSA.72.6	He will come down like rain on the mown grass,
PSA.72.6	as showers that water the earth.
PSA.72.7	In his days, the righteous shall flourish,
PSA.72.7	and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.
PSA.72.8	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,
PSA.72.8	from the River to the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him.
PSA.72.9	His enemies shall lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute.
PSA.72.10	The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
PSA.72.11	Yes, all kings shall fall down before him.
PSA.72.11	All nations shall serve him.
PSA.72.12	For he will deliver the needy when he cries;
PSA.72.12	the poor, who has no helper.
PSA.72.13	He will have pity on the poor and needy.
PSA.72.13	He will save the souls of the needy.
PSA.72.14	He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence.
PSA.72.14	Their blood will be precious in his sight.
PSA.72.15	They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.
PSA.72.15	Men shall pray for him continually.
PSA.72.15	They shall bless him all day long.
PSA.72.16	Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land.
PSA.72.16	Its fruit sways like Lebanon.
PSA.72.16	Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field.
PSA.72.17	His name endures forever.
PSA.72.17	His name continues as long as the sun.
PSA.72.17	Men shall be blessed by him.
PSA.72.17	All nations will call him blessed.
PSA.72.18	Praise be to the 
PSA.72.18	who alone does marvellous deeds.
PSA.72.19	Blessed be his glorious name forever!
PSA.72.19	Let the whole earth be filled with his glory!
PSA.72.19	Amen and amen.
PSA.72.20	This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.
PSA.73.1	Surely God
PSA.73.1	to those who are pure in heart.
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet were almost gone.
PSA.73.2	My steps had nearly slipped.
PSA.73.3	For I was envious of the arrogant,
PSA.73.3	when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
PSA.73.4	For there are no struggles in their death,
PSA.73.4	but their strength is firm.
PSA.73.5	They are free from burdens of men,
PSA.73.5	neither are they plagued like other men.
PSA.73.6	Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.
PSA.73.6	Violence covers them like a garment.
PSA.73.7	Their eyes bulge with fat.
PSA.73.7	Their minds pass the limits of conceit.
PSA.73.8	They scoff and speak with malice.
PSA.73.8	In arrogance, they threaten oppression.
PSA.73.9	They have set their mouth in the heavens.
PSA.73.9	Their tongue walks through the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore their people return to them,
PSA.73.10	and they drink up waters of abundance.
PSA.73.11	They say, “How does God know?
PSA.73.11	Is there knowledge in the Most High?”
PSA.73.12	Behold, these are the wicked.
PSA.73.12	Being always at ease, they increase in riches.
PSA.73.13	Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain,
PSA.73.13	and washed my hands in innocence,
PSA.73.14	For all day long I have been plagued,
PSA.73.14	and punished every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I had said, “I will speak thus”;
PSA.73.15	behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.
PSA.73.16	When I tried to understand this,
PSA.73.16	it was too painful for me,
PSA.73.17	until I entered God’s sanctuary,
PSA.73.17	and considered their latter end.
PSA.73.18	Surely you set them in slippery places.
PSA.73.18	You throw them down to destruction.
PSA.73.19	How they are suddenly destroyed!
PSA.73.19	They are completely swept away with terrors.
PSA.73.20	As a dream when one wakes up,
PSA.73.20	so, Lord,
PSA.73.21	For my soul was grieved.
PSA.73.21	I was embittered in my heart.
PSA.73.22	I was so senseless and ignorant.
PSA.73.22	I was a brute beast before you.
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless, I am continually with you.
PSA.73.23	You have held my right hand.
PSA.73.24	You will guide me with your counsel,
PSA.73.24	and afterward receive me to glory.
PSA.73.25	Whom do I have in heaven?
PSA.73.25	There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you.
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart fails,
PSA.73.26	but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
PSA.73.27	For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.
PSA.73.27	You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
PSA.73.28	But it is good for me to come close to God.
PSA.73.28	I have made the Lord the 
PSA.73.28	that I may tell of all your works.
PSA.74.1	God, why have you rejected us forever?
PSA.74.1	Why does your anger smoulder against the sheep of your pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,
PSA.74.2	which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance:
PSA.74.2	Mount Zion, in which you have lived.
PSA.74.3	Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,
PSA.74.3	all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly.
PSA.74.4	They have set up their standards as signs.
PSA.74.5	They behaved like men wielding axes,
PSA.74.5	cutting through a thicket of trees.
PSA.74.6	Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.
PSA.74.7	They have burnt your sanctuary to the ground.
PSA.74.7	They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.
PSA.74.8	They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.”
PSA.74.8	They have burnt up all the places in the land where God was worshipped.
PSA.74.9	We see no miraculous signs.
PSA.74.9	There is no longer any prophet,
PSA.74.9	neither is there amongst us anyone who knows how long.
PSA.74.10	How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?
PSA.74.10	Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
PSA.74.11	Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?
PSA.74.11	Take it from your chest and consume them!
PSA.74.12	Yet God is my King of old,
PSA.74.12	working salvation throughout the earth.
PSA.74.13	You divided the sea by your strength.
PSA.74.13	You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
PSA.74.14	You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.
PSA.74.14	You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.
PSA.74.15	You opened up spring and stream.
PSA.74.15	You dried up mighty rivers.
PSA.74.16	The day is yours, the night is also yours.
PSA.74.16	You have prepared the light and the sun.
PSA.74.17	You have set all the boundaries of the earth.
PSA.74.17	You have made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, 
PSA.74.18	Foolish people have blasphemed your name.
PSA.74.19	Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.
PSA.74.19	Don’t forget the life of your poor forever.
PSA.74.20	Honour your covenant,
PSA.74.20	for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.
PSA.74.21	Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed.
PSA.74.21	Let the poor and needy praise your name.
PSA.74.22	Arise, God! Plead your own cause.
PSA.74.22	Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.
PSA.74.23	Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries.
PSA.74.23	The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.
PSA.75.1	We give thanks to you, God.
PSA.75.1	We give thanks, for your Name is near.
PSA.75.1	Men tell about your wondrous works.
PSA.75.2	When I choose the appointed time,
PSA.75.2	I will judge blamelessly.
PSA.75.3	The earth and all its inhabitants quake.
PSA.75.3	I firmly hold its pillars. 
PSA.75.4	I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!”
PSA.75.4	I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.
PSA.75.5	Don’t lift up your horn on high.
PSA.75.5	Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”
PSA.75.6	For neither from the east, nor from the west,
PSA.75.6	nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.
PSA.75.7	But God is the judge.
PSA.75.7	He puts down one, and lifts up another.
PSA.75.8	For in the 
PSA.75.8	full of foaming wine mixed with spices.
PSA.75.8	He pours it out.
PSA.75.8	Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
PSA.75.9	But I will declare this forever:
PSA.75.9	I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,
PSA.75.10	but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
PSA.76.1	In Judah, God is known.
PSA.76.1	His name is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	His tabernacle is also in Salem;
PSA.76.2	His dwelling place in Zion.
PSA.76.3	There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,
PSA.76.3	the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. 
PSA.76.4	Glorious are you, and excellent,
PSA.76.4	more than mountains of game.
PSA.76.5	Valiant men lie plundered,
PSA.76.5	they have slept their last sleep.
PSA.76.5	None of the men of war can lift their hands.
PSA.76.6	At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
PSA.76.7	You, even you, are to be feared.
PSA.76.7	Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?
PSA.76.8	You pronounced judgement from heaven.
PSA.76.8	The earth feared, and was silent,
PSA.76.9	when God arose to judgement,
PSA.76.9	to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. 
PSA.76.10	Surely the wrath of man praises you.
PSA.76.10	The survivors of your wrath are restrained.
PSA.76.11	Make vows to the 
PSA.76.11	Let all of his neighbours bring presents to him who is to be feared.
PSA.76.12	He will cut off the spirit of princes.
PSA.76.12	He is feared by the kings of the earth.
PSA.77.1	My cry goes to God!
PSA.77.1	Indeed, I cry to God for help,
PSA.77.1	and for him to listen to me.
PSA.77.2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.
PSA.77.2	My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired.
PSA.77.2	My soul refused to be comforted.
PSA.77.3	I remember God, and I groan.
PSA.77.3	I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. 
PSA.77.4	You hold my eyelids open.
PSA.77.4	I am so troubled that I can’t speak.
PSA.77.5	I have considered the days of old,
PSA.77.5	the years of ancient times.
PSA.77.6	I remember my song in the night.
PSA.77.6	I consider in my own heart;
PSA.77.6	my spirit diligently enquires:
PSA.77.7	“Will the Lord reject us forever?
PSA.77.7	Will he be favourable no more?
PSA.77.8	Has his loving kindness vanished forever?
PSA.77.8	Does his promise fail for generations?
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to be gracious?
PSA.77.9	Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?” 
PSA.77.10	Then I thought, “I will appeal to this:
PSA.77.10	the years of the right hand of the Most High.”
PSA.77.11	I will remember the 
PSA.77.11	for I will remember your wonders of old.
PSA.77.12	I will also meditate on all your work,
PSA.77.12	and consider your doings.
PSA.77.13	Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.
PSA.77.13	What god is great like God?
PSA.77.14	You are the God who does wonders.
PSA.77.14	You have made your strength known amongst the peoples.
PSA.77.15	You have redeemed your people with your arm,
PSA.77.15	the sons of Jacob and Joseph. 
PSA.77.16	The waters saw you, God.
PSA.77.16	The waters saw you, and they writhed.
PSA.77.16	The depths also convulsed.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured out water.
PSA.77.17	The skies resounded with thunder.
PSA.77.17	Your arrows also flashed around.
PSA.77.18	The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.
PSA.77.18	The lightnings lit up the world.
PSA.77.18	The earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	Your way was through the sea;
PSA.77.19	your paths through the great waters.
PSA.77.19	Your footsteps were not known.
PSA.77.20	You led your people like a flock,
PSA.77.20	by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	Hear my teaching, my people.
PSA.78.1	Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.
PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth in a parable.
PSA.78.2	I will utter dark sayings of old,
PSA.78.3	Which we have heard and known,
PSA.78.3	and our fathers have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their children,
PSA.78.4	telling to the generation to come the praises of the 
PSA.78.4	his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.
PSA.78.5	For he established a covenant in Jacob,
PSA.78.5	and appointed a teaching in Israel,
PSA.78.5	which he commanded our fathers,
PSA.78.5	that they should make them known to their children;
PSA.78.6	that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;
PSA.78.6	who should arise and tell their children,
PSA.78.7	that they might set their hope in God,
PSA.78.7	and not forget God’s deeds,
PSA.78.7	but keep his commandments,
PSA.78.8	and might not be as their fathers,
PSA.78.8	a stubborn and rebellious generation,
PSA.78.8	a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,
PSA.78.8	whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
PSA.78.9	The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,
PSA.78.9	turned back in the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They didn’t keep God’s covenant,
PSA.78.10	and refused to walk in his law.
PSA.78.11	They forgot his doings,
PSA.78.11	his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.
PSA.78.12	He did marvellous things in the sight of their fathers,
PSA.78.12	in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
PSA.78.13	He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.
PSA.78.13	He made the waters stand as a heap.
PSA.78.14	In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,
PSA.78.14	and all night with a light of fire.
PSA.78.15	He split rocks in the wilderness,
PSA.78.15	and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
PSA.78.16	He brought streams also out of the rock,
PSA.78.16	and caused waters to run down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	Yet they still went on to sin against him,
PSA.78.17	to rebel against the Most High in the desert.
PSA.78.18	They tempted God in their heart
PSA.78.18	by asking food according to their desire.
PSA.78.19	Yes, they spoke against God.
PSA.78.19	They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,
PSA.78.20	and streams overflowed.
PSA.78.20	Can he give bread also?
PSA.78.20	Will he provide meat for his people?”
PSA.78.21	Therefore the 
PSA.78.21	A fire was kindled against Jacob,
PSA.78.21	anger also went up against Israel,
PSA.78.22	because they didn’t believe in God,
PSA.78.22	and didn’t trust in his salvation.
PSA.78.23	Yet he commanded the skies above,
PSA.78.23	and opened the doors of heaven.
PSA.78.24	He rained down manna on them to eat,
PSA.78.24	and gave them food from the sky.
PSA.78.25	Man ate the bread of angels.
PSA.78.25	He sent them food to the full.
PSA.78.26	He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.
PSA.78.26	By his power he guided the south wind.
PSA.78.27	He also rained meat on them as the dust,
PSA.78.27	winged birds as the sand of the seas.
PSA.78.28	He let them fall in the middle of their camp,
PSA.78.28	around their habitations.
PSA.78.29	So they ate, and were well filled.
PSA.78.29	He gave them their own desire.
PSA.78.30	They didn’t turn from their cravings.
PSA.78.30	Their food was yet in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	when the anger of God went up against them,
PSA.78.31	killed some of their fattest,
PSA.78.31	and struck down the young men of Israel.
PSA.78.32	For all this they still sinned,
PSA.78.32	and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.
PSA.78.33	Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,
PSA.78.33	and their years in terror.
PSA.78.34	When he killed them, then they enquired after him.
PSA.78.34	They returned and sought God earnestly.
PSA.78.35	They remembered that God was their rock,
PSA.78.35	the Most High God, their redeemer.
PSA.78.36	But they flattered him with their mouth,
PSA.78.36	and lied to him with their tongue.
PSA.78.37	For their heart was not right with him,
PSA.78.37	neither were they faithful in his covenant.
PSA.78.38	But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.
PSA.78.38	Yes, many times he turned his anger away,
PSA.78.38	and didn’t stir up all his wrath.
PSA.78.39	He remembered that they were but flesh,
PSA.78.39	a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.
PSA.78.40	How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,
PSA.78.40	and grieved him in the desert!
PSA.78.41	They turned again and tempted God,
PSA.78.41	and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They didn’t remember his hand,
PSA.78.42	nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
PSA.78.43	how he set his signs in Egypt,
PSA.78.43	his wonders in the field of Zoan,
PSA.78.44	he turned their rivers into blood,
PSA.78.44	and their streams, so that they could not drink.
PSA.78.45	He sent amongst them swarms of flies, which devoured them;
PSA.78.45	and frogs, which destroyed them.
PSA.78.46	He also gave their increase to the caterpillar,
PSA.78.46	and their labour to the locust.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail,
PSA.78.47	their sycamore fig trees with frost.
PSA.78.48	He also gave over their livestock to the hail,
PSA.78.48	and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
PSA.78.49	He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,
PSA.78.49	wrath, indignation, and trouble,
PSA.78.49	and a band of angels of evil.
PSA.78.50	He made a path for his anger.
PSA.78.50	He didn’t spare their soul from death,
PSA.78.50	but gave their life over to the pestilence,
PSA.78.51	and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,
PSA.78.51	the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
PSA.78.52	But he led out his own people like sheep,
PSA.78.52	and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
PSA.78.53	He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,
PSA.78.53	but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
PSA.78.54	He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,
PSA.78.54	to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.
PSA.78.55	He also drove out the nations before them,
PSA.78.55	allotted them for an inheritance by line,
PSA.78.55	and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
PSA.78.56	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,
PSA.78.56	and didn’t keep his testimonies,
PSA.78.57	but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.
PSA.78.57	They were twisted like a deceitful bow.
PSA.78.58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
PSA.78.58	and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.
PSA.78.59	When God heard this, he was angry,
PSA.78.59	and greatly abhorred Israel,
PSA.78.60	so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	the tent which he placed amongst men,
PSA.78.61	and delivered his strength into captivity,
PSA.78.61	his glory into the adversary’s hand.
PSA.78.62	He also gave his people over to the sword,
PSA.78.62	and was angry with his inheritance.
PSA.78.63	Fire devoured their young men.
PSA.78.63	Their virgins had no wedding song.
PSA.78.64	Their priests fell by the sword,
PSA.78.64	and their widows couldn’t weep.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,
PSA.78.65	like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.
PSA.78.66	He struck his adversaries backward.
PSA.78.66	He put them to a perpetual reproach.
PSA.78.67	Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,
PSA.78.67	and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,
PSA.78.68	But chose the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	Mount Zion which he loved.
PSA.78.69	He built his sanctuary like the heights,
PSA.78.69	like the earth which he has established forever.
PSA.78.70	He also chose David his servant,
PSA.78.70	and took him from the sheepfolds;
PSA.78.71	from following the ewes that have their young,
PSA.78.71	he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,
PSA.78.71	and Israel, his inheritance.
PSA.78.72	So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,
PSA.78.72	and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
PSA.79.1	God, the nations have come into your inheritance.
PSA.79.1	They have defiled your holy temple.
PSA.79.1	They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
PSA.79.2	They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky,
PSA.79.2	the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.
PSA.79.3	They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem.
PSA.79.3	There was no one to bury them.
PSA.79.4	We have become a reproach to our neighbours,
PSA.79.4	a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.
PSA.79.5	How long, 
PSA.79.5	Will you be angry forever?
PSA.79.5	Will your jealousy burn like fire?
PSA.79.6	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,
PSA.79.6	on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name;
PSA.79.7	for they have devoured Jacob,
PSA.79.7	and destroyed his homeland.
PSA.79.8	Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.
PSA.79.8	Let your tender mercies speedily meet us,
PSA.79.8	for we are in desperate need.
PSA.79.9	Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.
PSA.79.9	Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.
PSA.79.10	Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
PSA.79.10	Let it be known amongst the nations, before our eyes,
PSA.79.10	that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.
PSA.79.11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.
PSA.79.11	According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.
PSA.79.12	Pay back to our neighbours seven times into their bosom
PSA.79.12	their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.
PSA.79.13	So we, your people and sheep of your pasture,
PSA.79.13	will give you thanks forever.
PSA.79.13	We will praise you forever, to all generations.
PSA.80.1	Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,
PSA.80.1	you who lead Joseph like a flock,
PSA.80.1	you who sit above the cherubim, shine out.
PSA.80.2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might!
PSA.80.2	Come to save us!
PSA.80.3	Turn us again, God.
PSA.80.3	Cause your face to shine,
PSA.80.3	and we will be saved.
PSA.80.4	 God of Armies,
PSA.80.4	how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?
PSA.80.5	You have fed them with the bread of tears,
PSA.80.5	and given them tears to drink in large measure.
PSA.80.6	You make us a source of contention to our neighbours.
PSA.80.6	Our enemies laugh amongst themselves.
PSA.80.7	Turn us again, God of Armies.
PSA.80.7	Cause your face to shine,
PSA.80.7	and we will be saved.
PSA.80.8	You brought a vine out of Egypt.
PSA.80.8	You drove out the nations, and planted it.
PSA.80.9	You cleared the ground for it.
PSA.80.9	It took deep root, and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	The mountains were covered with its shadow.
PSA.80.10	Its boughs were like God’s cedars.
PSA.80.11	It sent out its branches to the sea,
PSA.80.11	its shoots to the River.
PSA.80.12	Why have you broken down its walls,
PSA.80.12	so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?
PSA.80.13	The boar out of the wood ravages it.
PSA.80.13	The wild animals of the field feed on it.
PSA.80.14	Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,
PSA.80.15	the stock which your right hand planted,
PSA.80.15	the branch that you made strong for yourself.
PSA.80.16	It’s burnt with fire.
PSA.80.16	It’s cut down.
PSA.80.16	They perish at your rebuke.
PSA.80.17	Let your hand be on the man of your right hand,
PSA.80.17	on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.
PSA.80.18	So we will not turn away from you.
PSA.80.18	Revive us, and we will call on your name.
PSA.80.19	Turn us again, 
PSA.80.19	Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
PSA.81.1	Sing aloud to God, our strength!
PSA.81.1	Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob!
PSA.81.2	Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine,
PSA.81.2	the pleasant lyre with the harp.
PSA.81.3	Blow the trumpet at the New Moon,
PSA.81.3	at the full moon, on our feast day.
PSA.81.4	For it is a statute for Israel,
PSA.81.4	an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	He appointed it in Joseph for a covenant,
PSA.81.5	when he went out over the land of Egypt,
PSA.81.5	I heard a language that I didn’t know.
PSA.81.6	“I removed his shoulder from the burden.
PSA.81.6	His hands were freed from the basket.
PSA.81.7	You called in trouble, and I delivered you.
PSA.81.7	I answered you in the secret place of thunder.
PSA.81.7	I tested you at the waters of Meribah.” 
PSA.81.8	“Hear, my people, and I will testify to you,
PSA.81.8	Israel, if you would listen to me!
PSA.81.9	There shall be no strange god in you,
PSA.81.9	neither shall you worship any foreign god.
PSA.81.10	I am the 
PSA.81.10	who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
PSA.81.11	But my people didn’t listen to my voice.
PSA.81.11	Israel desired none of me.
PSA.81.12	So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts,
PSA.81.12	that they might walk in their own counsels.
PSA.81.13	Oh that my people would listen to me,
PSA.81.13	that Israel would walk in my ways!
PSA.81.14	I would soon subdue their enemies,
PSA.81.14	and turn my hand against their adversaries.
PSA.81.15	The haters of the 
PSA.81.15	and their punishment would last forever.
PSA.81.16	But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat.
PSA.81.16	I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.”
PSA.82.1	God presides in the great assembly.
PSA.82.1	He judges amongst the gods.
PSA.82.2	“How long will you judge unjustly,
PSA.82.2	and show partiality to the wicked?” 
PSA.82.3	“Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless.
PSA.82.3	Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
PSA.82.4	Rescue the weak and needy.
PSA.82.4	Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”
PSA.82.5	They don’t know, neither do they understand.
PSA.82.5	They walk back and forth in darkness.
PSA.82.5	All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
PSA.82.6	I said, “You are gods,
PSA.82.6	all of you are sons of the Most High.
PSA.82.7	Nevertheless you shall die like men,
PSA.82.7	and fall like one of the rulers.”
PSA.82.8	Arise, God, judge the earth,
PSA.82.8	for you inherit all of the nations.
PSA.83.1	God, don’t keep silent.
PSA.83.1	Don’t keep silent,
PSA.83.1	and don’t be still, God.
PSA.83.2	For, behold, your enemies are stirred up.
PSA.83.2	Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.
PSA.83.3	They conspire with cunning against your people.
PSA.83.3	They plot against your cherished ones.
PSA.83.4	“Come,” they say, “let’s destroy them as a nation,
PSA.83.4	that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.”
PSA.83.5	For they have conspired together with one mind.
PSA.83.5	They form an alliance against you.
PSA.83.6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
PSA.83.6	Moab, and the Hagrites;
PSA.83.7	Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;
PSA.83.7	Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
PSA.83.8	Assyria also is joined with them.
PSA.83.8	They have helped the children of Lot. 
PSA.83.9	Do to them as you did to Midian,
PSA.83.9	as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
PSA.83.10	who perished at Endor,
PSA.83.10	who became as dung for the earth.
PSA.83.11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
PSA.83.11	yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
PSA.83.12	who said, “Let’s take possession of God’s pasture lands.”
PSA.83.13	My God, make them like tumbleweed,
PSA.83.13	like chaff before the wind.
PSA.83.14	As the fire that burns the forest,
PSA.83.14	as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,
PSA.83.15	so pursue them with your tempest,
PSA.83.15	and terrify them with your storm.
PSA.83.16	Fill their faces with confusion,
PSA.83.16	that they may seek your name, 
PSA.83.17	Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever.
PSA.83.17	Yes, let them be confounded and perish;
PSA.83.18	that they may know that you alone, whose name is the 
PSA.83.18	are the Most High over all the earth.
PSA.84.1	How lovely are your dwellings,
PSA.84.1	 of Armies!
PSA.84.2	My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of the 
PSA.84.2	My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
PSA.84.3	Yes, the sparrow has found a home,
PSA.84.3	and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young,
PSA.84.3	near your altars, 
PSA.84.4	Blessed are those who dwell in your house.
PSA.84.4	They are always praising you. 
PSA.84.5	Blessed are those whose strength is in you,
PSA.84.5	who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.
PSA.84.6	Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs.
PSA.84.6	Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength.
PSA.84.7	Every one of them appears before God in Zion.
PSA.84.8	, God of Armies, hear my prayer.
PSA.84.8	Listen, God of Jacob. 
PSA.84.9	Behold, God our shield,
PSA.84.9	look at the face of your anointed.
PSA.84.10	For a day in your courts is better than a thousand.
PSA.84.10	I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,
PSA.84.10	than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.11	The 
PSA.84.11	He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.
PSA.84.12	 of Armies,
PSA.84.12	blessed is the man who trusts in you.
PSA.85.1	, you have been favourable to your land.
PSA.85.1	You have restored the fortunes of Jacob.
PSA.85.2	You have forgiven the iniquity of your people.
PSA.85.2	You have covered all their sin. 
PSA.85.3	You have taken away all your wrath.
PSA.85.3	You have turned from the fierceness of your anger.
PSA.85.4	Turn us, God of our salvation,
PSA.85.4	and cause your indignation towards us to cease.
PSA.85.5	Will you be angry with us forever?
PSA.85.5	Will you draw out your anger to all generations?
PSA.85.6	Won’t you revive us again,
PSA.85.6	that your people may rejoice in you?
PSA.85.7	Show us your loving kindness, 
PSA.85.7	Grant us your salvation.
PSA.85.8	I will hear what God, the 
PSA.85.8	for he will speak peace to his people, his saints;
PSA.85.8	but let them not turn again to folly.
PSA.85.9	Surely his salvation is near those who fear him,
PSA.85.9	that glory may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Mercy and truth meet together.
PSA.85.10	Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
PSA.85.11	Truth springs out of the earth.
PSA.85.11	Righteousness has looked down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	Yes, the 
PSA.85.12	Our land will yield its increase.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness goes before him,
PSA.85.13	And prepares the way for his steps.
PSA.86.1	Hear, 
PSA.86.1	for I am poor and needy.
PSA.86.2	Preserve my soul, for I am godly.
PSA.86.2	You, my God, save your servant who trusts in you.
PSA.86.3	Be merciful to me, Lord,
PSA.86.3	for I call to you all day long.
PSA.86.4	Bring joy to the soul of your servant,
PSA.86.4	for to you, Lord, do I lift up my soul.
PSA.86.5	For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive,
PSA.86.5	abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you.
PSA.86.6	Hear, 
PSA.86.6	Listen to the voice of my petitions.
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I will call on you,
PSA.86.7	for you will answer me.
PSA.86.8	There is no one like you amongst the gods, Lord,
PSA.86.8	nor any deeds like your deeds.
PSA.86.9	All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord.
PSA.86.9	They shall glorify your name.
PSA.86.10	For you are great, and do wondrous things.
PSA.86.10	You are God alone.
PSA.86.11	Teach me your way, 
PSA.86.11	I will walk in your truth.
PSA.86.11	Make my heart undivided to fear your name.
PSA.86.12	I will praise you, Lord my God, with my whole heart.
PSA.86.12	I will glorify your name forever more.
PSA.86.13	For your loving kindness is great towards me.
PSA.86.13	You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
PSA.86.14	God, the proud have risen up against me.
PSA.86.14	A company of violent men have sought after my soul,
PSA.86.14	and they don’t hold regard for you before them.
PSA.86.15	But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God,
PSA.86.15	slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth.
PSA.86.16	Turn to me, and have mercy on me!
PSA.86.16	Give your strength to your servant.
PSA.86.16	Save the son of your servant.
PSA.86.17	Show me a sign of your goodness,
PSA.86.17	that those who hate me may see it, and be shamed,
PSA.86.17	because you, 
PSA.87.1	His foundation is in the holy mountains.
PSA.87.2	The 
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. 
PSA.87.4	I will record Rahab
PSA.87.4	Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia:
PSA.87.4	“This one was born there.”
PSA.87.5	Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her;”
PSA.87.5	the Most High himself will establish her.
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.6	“This one was born there.” 
PSA.87.7	Those who sing as well as those who dance say,
PSA.87.7	“All my springs are in you.”
PSA.88.1	, the God of my salvation,
PSA.88.1	I have cried day and night before you.
PSA.88.2	Let my prayer enter into your presence.
PSA.88.2	Turn your ear to my cry.
PSA.88.3	For my soul is full of troubles.
PSA.88.3	My life draws near to Sheol.
PSA.88.4	I am counted amongst those who go down into the pit.
PSA.88.4	I am like a man who has no help,
PSA.88.5	set apart amongst the dead,
PSA.88.5	like the slain who lie in the grave,
PSA.88.5	whom you remember no more.
PSA.88.5	They are cut off from your hand.
PSA.88.6	You have laid me in the lowest pit,
PSA.88.6	in the darkest depths.
PSA.88.7	Your wrath lies heavily on me.
PSA.88.7	You have afflicted me with all your waves. 
PSA.88.8	You have taken my friends from me.
PSA.88.8	You have made me an abomination to them.
PSA.88.8	I am confined, and I can’t escape.
PSA.88.9	My eyes are dim from grief.
PSA.88.9	I have called on you daily, 
PSA.88.9	I have spread out my hands to you.
PSA.88.10	Do you show wonders to the dead?
PSA.88.10	Do the departed spirits rise up and praise you? 
PSA.88.11	Is your loving kindness declared in the grave?
PSA.88.11	Or your faithfulness in Destruction?
PSA.88.12	Are your wonders made known in the dark?
PSA.88.12	Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
PSA.88.13	But to you, 
PSA.88.13	In the morning, my prayer comes before you.
PSA.88.14	, why do you reject my soul?
PSA.88.14	Why do you hide your face from me?
PSA.88.15	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up.
PSA.88.15	While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.
PSA.88.16	Your fierce wrath has gone over me.
PSA.88.16	Your terrors have cut me off.
PSA.88.17	They came around me like water all day long.
PSA.88.17	They completely engulfed me.
PSA.88.18	You have put lover and friend far from me,
PSA.88.18	and my friends into darkness.
PSA.89.1	I will sing of the loving kindness of the 
PSA.89.1	With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.
PSA.89.2	I indeed declare, “Love stands firm forever.
PSA.89.2	You established the heavens.
PSA.89.2	Your faithfulness is in them.”
PSA.89.3	“I have made a covenant with my chosen one,
PSA.89.3	I have sworn to David, my servant,
PSA.89.4	‘I will establish your offspring forever,
PSA.89.4	and build up your throne to all generations.’” 
PSA.89.5	The heavens will praise your wonders, 
PSA.89.5	your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
PSA.89.6	For who in the skies can be compared to the 
PSA.89.6	Who amongst the sons of the heavenly beings is like the 
PSA.89.7	a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones,
PSA.89.7	to be feared above all those who are around him?
PSA.89.8	, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you?
PSA.89.8	The 
PSA.89.9	You rule the pride of the sea.
PSA.89.9	When its waves rise up, you calm them.
PSA.89.10	You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.
PSA.89.10	You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
PSA.89.11	The heavens are yours.
PSA.89.11	The earth also is yours,
PSA.89.11	the world and its fullness.
PSA.89.11	You have founded them.
PSA.89.12	You have created the north and the south.
PSA.89.12	Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.
PSA.89.13	You have a mighty arm.
PSA.89.13	Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.
PSA.89.14	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.
PSA.89.14	Loving kindness and truth go before your face.
PSA.89.15	Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.
PSA.89.15	They walk in the light of your presence, 
PSA.89.16	In your name they rejoice all day.
PSA.89.16	In your righteousness, they are exalted.
PSA.89.17	For you are the glory of their strength.
PSA.89.17	In your favour, our horn will be exalted.
PSA.89.18	For our shield belongs to the 
PSA.89.18	our king to the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.89.19	Then you spoke in vision to your saints,
PSA.89.19	and said, “I have given strength to the warrior.
PSA.89.19	I have exalted a young man from the people.
PSA.89.20	I have found David, my servant.
PSA.89.20	I have anointed him with my holy oil,
PSA.89.21	with whom my hand shall be established.
PSA.89.21	My arm will also strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	No enemy will tax him.
PSA.89.22	No wicked man will oppress him.
PSA.89.23	I will beat down his adversaries before him,
PSA.89.23	and strike those who hate him.
PSA.89.24	But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him.
PSA.89.24	In my name, his horn will be exalted.
PSA.89.25	I will set his hand also on the sea,
PSA.89.25	and his right hand on the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He will call to me, ‘You are my Father,
PSA.89.26	my God, and the rock of my salvation!’
PSA.89.27	I will also appoint him my firstborn,
PSA.89.27	the highest of the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more.
PSA.89.28	My covenant will stand firm with him.
PSA.89.29	I will also make his offspring endure forever,
PSA.89.29	and his throne as the days of heaven.
PSA.89.30	If his children forsake my law,
PSA.89.30	and don’t walk in my ordinances;
PSA.89.31	if they break my statutes,
PSA.89.31	and don’t keep my commandments;
PSA.89.32	then I will punish their sin with the rod,
PSA.89.32	and their iniquity with stripes.
PSA.89.33	But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him,
PSA.89.33	nor allow my faithfulness to fail.
PSA.89.34	I will not break my covenant,
PSA.89.34	nor alter what my lips have uttered.
PSA.89.35	Once I have sworn by my holiness,
PSA.89.35	I will not lie to David.
PSA.89.36	His offspring will endure forever,
PSA.89.36	his throne like the sun before me.
PSA.89.37	It will be established forever like the moon,
PSA.89.37	the faithful witness in the sky.” 
PSA.89.38	But you have rejected and spurned.
PSA.89.38	You have been angry with your anointed.
PSA.89.39	You have renounced the covenant of your servant.
PSA.89.39	You have defiled his crown in the dust.
PSA.89.40	You have broken down all his hedges.
PSA.89.40	You have brought his strongholds to ruin.
PSA.89.41	All who pass by the way rob him.
PSA.89.41	He has become a reproach to his neighbours.
PSA.89.42	You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.
PSA.89.42	You have made all of his enemies rejoice.
PSA.89.43	Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword,
PSA.89.43	and haven’t supported him in battle.
PSA.89.44	You have ended his splendour,
PSA.89.44	and thrown his throne down to the ground.
PSA.89.45	You have shortened the days of his youth.
PSA.89.45	You have covered him with shame. 
PSA.89.46	How long, 
PSA.89.46	Will you hide yourself forever?
PSA.89.46	Will your wrath burn like fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember how short my time is,
PSA.89.47	for what vanity you have created all the children of men!
PSA.89.48	What man is he who shall live and not see death,
PSA.89.48	who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?
PSA.89.49	Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses,
PSA.89.49	which you swore to David in your faithfulness?
PSA.89.50	Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants,
PSA.89.50	how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,
PSA.89.51	With which your enemies have mocked, 
PSA.89.51	with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.
PSA.89.52	Blessed be the 
PSA.89.52	Amen, and Amen.
PSA.90.1	Lord,
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were born,
PSA.90.2	before you had formed the earth and the world,
PSA.90.2	even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
PSA.90.3	You turn man to destruction, saying,
PSA.90.3	“Return, you children of men.”
PSA.90.4	For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past,
PSA.90.4	like a watch in the night.
PSA.90.5	You sweep them away as they sleep.
PSA.90.5	In the morning they sprout like new grass.
PSA.90.6	In the morning it sprouts and springs up.
PSA.90.6	By evening, it is withered and dry.
PSA.90.7	For we are consumed in your anger.
PSA.90.7	We are troubled in your wrath.
PSA.90.8	You have set our iniquities before you,
PSA.90.8	our secret sins in the light of your presence.
PSA.90.9	For all our days have passed away in your wrath.
PSA.90.9	We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
PSA.90.10	The days of our years are seventy,
PSA.90.10	or even by reason of strength eighty years;
PSA.90.10	yet their pride is but labour and sorrow,
PSA.90.10	for it passes quickly, and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	Who knows the power of your anger,
PSA.90.11	your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?
PSA.90.12	So teach us to count our days,
PSA.90.12	that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
PSA.90.13	Relent, 
PSA.90.13	How long?
PSA.90.13	Have compassion on your servants!
PSA.90.14	Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness,
PSA.90.14	that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
PSA.90.15	Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,
PSA.90.15	for as many years as we have seen evil.
PSA.90.16	Let your work appear to your servants,
PSA.90.16	your glory to their children.
PSA.90.17	Let the favour of the Lord our God be on us.
PSA.90.17	Establish the work of our hands for us.
PSA.90.17	Yes, establish the work of our hands.
PSA.91.1	He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High
PSA.91.1	will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	I will say of the 
PSA.91.2	my God, in whom I trust.”
PSA.91.3	For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,
PSA.91.3	and from the deadly pestilence.
PSA.91.4	He will cover you with his feathers.
PSA.91.4	Under his wings you will take refuge.
PSA.91.4	His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.
PSA.91.5	You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,
PSA.91.5	nor of the arrow that flies by day,
PSA.91.6	nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,
PSA.91.6	nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.
PSA.91.7	A thousand may fall at your side,
PSA.91.7	and ten thousand at your right hand;
PSA.91.7	but it will not come near you.
PSA.91.8	You will only look with your eyes,
PSA.91.8	and see the recompense of the wicked.
PSA.91.9	Because you have made 
PSA.91.9	and the Most High your dwelling place,
PSA.91.10	no evil shall happen to you,
PSA.91.10	neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.
PSA.91.11	For he will put his angels in charge of you,
PSA.91.11	to guard you in all your ways.
PSA.91.12	They will bear you up in their hands,
PSA.91.12	so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone.
PSA.91.13	You will tread on the lion and cobra.
PSA.91.13	You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.
PSA.91.14	“Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him.
PSA.91.14	I will set him on high, because he has known my name.
PSA.91.15	He will call on me, and I will answer him.
PSA.91.15	I will be with him in trouble.
PSA.91.15	I will deliver him, and honour him.
PSA.91.16	I will satisfy him with long life,
PSA.91.16	and show him my salvation.”
PSA.92.1	It is a good thing to give thanks to the 
PSA.92.1	to sing praises to your name, Most High,
PSA.92.2	to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning,
PSA.92.2	and your faithfulness every night,
PSA.92.3	with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp,
PSA.92.3	and with the melody of the lyre.
PSA.92.4	For you, 
PSA.92.4	I will triumph in the works of your hands.
PSA.92.5	How great are your works, 
PSA.92.5	Your thoughts are very deep.
PSA.92.6	A senseless man doesn’t know,
PSA.92.6	neither does a fool understand this:
PSA.92.7	though the wicked spring up as the grass,
PSA.92.7	and all the evildoers flourish,
PSA.92.7	they will be destroyed forever.
PSA.92.8	But you, 
PSA.92.9	For, behold, your enemies, 
PSA.92.9	for, behold, your enemies shall perish.
PSA.92.9	All the evildoers will be scattered.
PSA.92.10	But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox.
PSA.92.10	I am anointed with fresh oil.
PSA.92.11	My eye has also seen my enemies.
PSA.92.11	My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me.
PSA.92.12	The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.
PSA.92.12	He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	They are planted in the 
PSA.92.13	They will flourish in our God’s courts.
PSA.92.14	They will still produce fruit in old age.
PSA.92.14	They will be full of sap and green,
PSA.92.15	to show that the 
PSA.92.15	He is my rock,
PSA.92.15	and there is no unrighteousness in him.
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.1	He is clothed with majesty!
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.1	The world also is established.
PSA.93.1	It can’t be moved.
PSA.93.2	Your throne is established from long ago.
PSA.93.2	You are from everlasting.
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up, 
PSA.93.3	the floods have lifted up their voice.
PSA.93.3	The floods lift up their waves.
PSA.93.4	Above the voices of many waters,
PSA.93.4	the mighty breakers of the sea,
PSA.93.4	The 
PSA.93.5	Your statutes stand firm.
PSA.93.5	Holiness adorns your house,
PSA.93.5	, forever more.
PSA.94.1	, you God to whom vengeance belongs,
PSA.94.1	you God to whom vengeance belongs, shine out.
PSA.94.2	Rise up, you judge of the earth.
PSA.94.2	Pay back the proud what they deserve.
PSA.94.3	, how long will the wicked,
PSA.94.3	how long will the wicked triumph?
PSA.94.4	They pour out arrogant words.
PSA.94.4	All the evildoers boast.
PSA.94.5	They break your people in pieces, 
PSA.94.5	and afflict your heritage.
PSA.94.6	They kill the widow and the alien,
PSA.94.6	and murder the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	They say, “The 
PSA.94.7	neither will Jacob’s God consider.”
PSA.94.8	Consider, you senseless amongst the people;
PSA.94.8	you fools, when will you be wise?
PSA.94.9	He who implanted the ear, won’t he hear?
PSA.94.9	He who formed the eye, won’t he see?
PSA.94.10	He who disciplines the nations, won’t he punish?
PSA.94.10	He who teaches man knows.
PSA.94.11	The 
PSA.94.11	that they are futile.
PSA.94.12	Blessed is the man whom you discipline, 
PSA.94.12	and teach out of your law,
PSA.94.13	that you may give him rest from the days of adversity,
PSA.94.13	until the pit is dug for the wicked.
PSA.94.14	For the 
PSA.94.14	neither will he forsake his inheritance.
PSA.94.15	For judgement will return to righteousness.
PSA.94.15	All the upright in heart shall follow it.
PSA.94.16	Who will rise up for me against the wicked?
PSA.94.16	Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?
PSA.94.17	Unless the 
PSA.94.17	my soul would have soon lived in silence.
PSA.94.18	When I said, “My foot is slipping!”
PSA.94.18	Your loving kindness, 
PSA.94.19	In the multitude of my thoughts within me,
PSA.94.19	your comforts delight my soul.
PSA.94.20	Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,
PSA.94.20	which brings about mischief by statute?
PSA.94.21	They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
PSA.94.21	and condemn the innocent blood.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.22	my God, the rock of my refuge.
PSA.94.23	He has brought on them their own iniquity,
PSA.94.23	and will cut them off in their own wickedness.

PSA.95.8	Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah,
PSA.95.8	as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
PSA.95.9	when your fathers tempted me,
PSA.95.9	tested me, and saw my work.
PSA.95.10	Forty long years I was grieved with that generation,
PSA.95.10	and said, “It is a people that errs in their heart.
PSA.95.10	They have not known my ways.”

PSA.102.3	For my days consume away like smoke.
PSA.102.3	My bones are burnt as a torch.

PSA.102.4	for I forget to eat my bread.
PSA.102.5	By reason of the voice of my groaning,
PSA.102.5	my bones stick to my skin.
PSA.102.6	I am like a pelican of the wilderness.
PSA.102.6	I have become as an owl of the waste places.
PSA.102.7	I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop.
PSA.102.8	My enemies reproach me all day.
PSA.102.8	Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.
PSA.102.9	For I have eaten ashes like bread,
PSA.102.9	and mixed my drink with tears,
PSA.102.10	because of your indignation and your wrath;
PSA.102.10	for you have taken me up and thrown me away.
PSA.102.11	My days are like a long shadow.

PSA.102.24	Your years are throughout all generations.
PSA.102.25	Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth.
PSA.102.25	The heavens are the work of your hands.
PSA.102.26	They will perish, but you will endure.
PSA.102.26	Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment.
PSA.102.26	You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed.
PSA.102.27	But you are the same.
PSA.102.27	Your years will have no end.
PSA.102.28	The children of your servants will continue.
PSA.102.28	Their offspring will be established before you.”

PSA.103.1	All that is within me, praise his holy name!

PSA.103.5	so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.6	and justice for all who are oppressed.

PSA.103.7	his deeds to the children of Israel.
PSA.103.8	The 
PSA.103.8	slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.
PSA.103.9	He will not always accuse;
PSA.103.9	neither will he stay angry forever.
PSA.103.10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins,
PSA.103.10	nor repaid us for our iniquities.
PSA.103.11	For as the heavens are high above the earth,
PSA.103.11	so great is his loving kindness towards those who fear him.
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west,
PSA.103.12	so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
PSA.103.13	Like a father has compassion on his children,
PSA.103.13	so the 
PSA.103.14	For he knows how we are made.
PSA.103.14	He remembers that we are dust.
PSA.103.15	As for man, his days are like grass.
PSA.103.15	As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
PSA.103.16	For the wind passes over it, and it is gone.
PSA.103.16	Its place remembers it no more.
PSA.103.17	But the 
PSA.103.17	his righteousness to children’s children,
PSA.103.18	to those who keep his covenant,

PSA.103.19	His kingdom rules over all.

PSA.104.2	He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.
PSA.104.3	He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters.
PSA.104.3	He makes the clouds his chariot.
PSA.104.3	He walks on the wings of the wind.
PSA.104.4	He makes his messengers
PSA.104.4	and his servants flames of fire.
PSA.104.5	He laid the foundations of the earth,
PSA.104.5	that it should not be moved forever.
PSA.104.6	You covered it with the deep as with a cloak.
PSA.104.6	The waters stood above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At your rebuke they fled.
PSA.104.7	At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.
PSA.104.8	The mountains rose,
PSA.104.8	the valleys sank down,
PSA.104.8	to the place which you had assigned to them.
PSA.104.9	You have set a boundary that they may not pass over,
PSA.104.9	that they don’t turn again to cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	He sends springs into the valleys.
PSA.104.10	They run amongst the mountains.
PSA.104.11	They give drink to every animal of the field.
PSA.104.11	The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	The birds of the sky nest by them.
PSA.104.12	They sing amongst the branches.
PSA.104.13	He waters the mountains from his rooms.
PSA.104.13	The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.
PSA.104.14	He causes the grass to grow for the livestock,
PSA.104.14	and plants for man to cultivate,
PSA.104.14	that he may produce food out of the earth:
PSA.104.15	wine that makes the heart of man glad,
PSA.104.15	oil to make his face to shine,
PSA.104.15	and bread that strengthens man’s heart.
PSA.104.16	The 
PSA.104.16	the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted,
PSA.104.17	where the birds make their nests.
PSA.104.17	The stork makes its home in the cypress trees.
PSA.104.18	The high mountains are for the wild goats.
PSA.104.18	The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.
PSA.104.19	He appointed the moon for seasons.
PSA.104.19	The sun knows when to set.
PSA.104.20	You make darkness, and it is night,
PSA.104.20	in which all the animals of the forest prowl.
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar after their prey,
PSA.104.21	and seek their food from God.
PSA.104.22	The sun rises, and they steal away,
PSA.104.22	and lie down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Man goes out to his work,
PSA.104.23	to his labour until the evening.
PSA.104.24	The 
PSA.104.24	In wisdom, you have made them all.
PSA.104.24	The earth is full of your riches.
PSA.104.25	There is the sea, great and wide,
PSA.104.25	in which are innumerable living things,
PSA.104.25	both small and large animals.
PSA.104.26	There the ships go,
PSA.104.26	and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.
PSA.104.27	These all wait for you,
PSA.104.27	that you may give them their food in due season.
PSA.104.28	You give to them; they gather.
PSA.104.28	You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.
PSA.104.29	You hide your face; they are troubled.
PSA.104.29	You take away their breath; they die and return to the dust.
PSA.104.30	You send out your Spirit and they are created.
PSA.104.30	You renew the face of the ground.
PSA.104.31	Let the 
PSA.104.31	Let the

PSA.105.3	Let the heart of those who seek the 
PSA.105.4	Seek the 
PSA.105.4	Seek his face forever more.
PSA.105.5	Remember his marvellous works that he has done:
PSA.105.5	his wonders, and the judgements of his mouth,
PSA.105.6	you offspring of Abraham, his servant,
PSA.105.6	you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
PSA.105.7	He is the 
PSA.105.7	His judgements are in all the earth.
PSA.105.8	He has remembered his covenant forever,
PSA.105.8	the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
PSA.105.9	the covenant which he made with Abraham,
PSA.105.9	his oath to Isaac,
PSA.105.10	and confirmed it to Jacob for a statute;
PSA.105.10	to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
PSA.105.11	saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,
PSA.105.11	the lot of your inheritance,”
PSA.105.12	when they were but a few men in number,
PSA.105.12	yes, very few, and foreigners in it.
PSA.105.13	They went about from nation to nation,
PSA.105.13	from one kingdom to another people.
PSA.105.14	He allowed no one to do them wrong.
PSA.105.14	Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,
PSA.105.15	“Don’t touch my anointed ones!
PSA.105.15	Do my prophets no harm!”
PSA.105.16	He called for a famine on the land.
PSA.105.16	He destroyed the food supplies.
PSA.105.17	He sent a man before them.

PSA.105.18	His neck was locked in irons,
PSA.105.19	until the time that his word happened,
PSA.105.19	and the 
PSA.105.20	The king sent and freed him,
PSA.105.20	even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
PSA.105.21	He made him lord of his house,
PSA.105.21	and ruler of all of his possessions,
PSA.105.22	to discipline his princes at his pleasure,
PSA.105.22	and to teach his elders wisdom.
PSA.105.23	Israel also came into Egypt.
PSA.105.23	Jacob lived in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	He increased his people greatly,
PSA.105.24	and made them stronger than their adversaries.
PSA.105.25	He turned their heart to hate his people,
PSA.105.25	to conspire against his servants.
PSA.105.26	He sent Moses, his servant,
PSA.105.26	and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
PSA.105.27	They performed miracles amongst them,
PSA.105.27	and wonders in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness, and made it dark.
PSA.105.28	They didn’t rebel against his words.
PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood,
PSA.105.29	and killed their fish.
PSA.105.30	Their land swarmed with frogs,
PSA.105.30	even in the rooms of their kings.
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and swarms of flies came,
PSA.105.31	and lice in all their borders.
PSA.105.32	He gave them hail for rain,
PSA.105.32	with lightning in their land.
PSA.105.33	He struck their vines and also their fig trees,
PSA.105.33	and shattered the trees of their country.
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and the locusts came
PSA.105.34	with the grasshoppers, without number,
PSA.105.35	ate up every plant in their land,
PSA.105.35	and ate up the fruit of their ground.
PSA.105.36	He struck also all the firstborn in their land,
PSA.105.36	the first fruits of all their manhood.
PSA.105.37	He brought them out with silver and gold.
PSA.105.37	There was not one feeble person amongst his tribes.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they departed,
PSA.105.38	for the fear of them had fallen on them.
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud for a covering,
PSA.105.39	fire to give light in the night.
PSA.105.40	They asked, and he brought quails,
PSA.105.40	and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.
PSA.105.41	They ran as a river in the dry places.
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his holy word,
PSA.105.42	and Abraham, his servant.
PSA.105.43	He brought his people out with joy,
PSA.105.43	his chosen with singing.
PSA.105.44	He gave them the lands of the nations.
PSA.105.44	They took the labour of the peoples in possession,
PSA.105.45	that they might keep his statutes,
PSA.105.45	and observe his laws.
PSA.105.45	Praise the 
PSA.106.1	Praise the 
PSA.106.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.106.1	for his loving kindness endures forever.
PSA.106.2	Who can utter the mighty acts of the 
PSA.106.2	or fully declare all his praise?
PSA.106.3	Blessed are those who keep justice.
PSA.106.3	Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, 
PSA.106.4	Visit me with your salvation,
PSA.106.5	that I may see the prosperity of your chosen,
PSA.106.5	that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,
PSA.106.5	that I may glory with your inheritance.
PSA.106.6	We have sinned with our fathers.
PSA.106.6	We have committed iniquity.
PSA.106.6	We have done wickedly.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt.
PSA.106.7	They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,
PSA.106.7	but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,
PSA.106.8	that he might make his mighty power known.
PSA.106.9	He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;
PSA.106.9	so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.
PSA.106.10	He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,
PSA.106.10	and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
PSA.106.11	The waters covered their adversaries.
PSA.106.11	There was not one of them left.
PSA.106.12	Then they believed his words.
PSA.106.12	They sang his praise.
PSA.106.13	They soon forgot his works.
PSA.106.13	They didn’t wait for his counsel,
PSA.106.14	but gave in to craving in the desert,
PSA.106.14	and tested God in the wasteland.
PSA.106.15	He gave them their request,
PSA.106.15	but sent leanness into their soul.
PSA.106.16	They envied Moses also in the camp,
PSA.106.16	and Aaron, the 
PSA.106.17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
PSA.106.17	and covered the company of Abiram.
PSA.106.18	A fire was kindled in their company.
PSA.106.18	The flame burnt up the wicked.
PSA.106.19	They made a calf in Horeb,
PSA.106.19	and worshipped a molten image.
PSA.106.20	Thus they exchanged their glory
PSA.106.20	for an image of a bull that eats grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgot God, their Saviour,
PSA.106.21	who had done great things in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	wondrous works in the land of Ham,
PSA.106.22	and awesome things by the Red Sea.
PSA.106.23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them,
PSA.106.23	had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,
PSA.106.23	to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.
PSA.106.24	Yes, they despised the pleasant land.
PSA.106.24	They didn’t believe his word,
PSA.106.25	but murmured in their tents,
PSA.106.25	and didn’t listen to the 
PSA.106.26	Therefore he swore to them
PSA.106.26	that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
PSA.106.27	that he would overthrow their offspring amongst the nations,
PSA.106.27	and scatter them in the lands.
PSA.106.28	They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,
PSA.106.28	and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
PSA.106.29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.
PSA.106.29	The plague broke in on them.
PSA.106.30	Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgement,
PSA.106.30	so the plague was stopped.
PSA.106.31	That was credited to him for righteousness,
PSA.106.31	for all generations to come.
PSA.106.32	They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,
PSA.106.32	so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;
PSA.106.33	because they were rebellious against his spirit,
PSA.106.33	he spoke rashly with his lips.
PSA.106.34	They didn’t destroy the peoples,
PSA.106.34	as the 
PSA.106.35	but mixed themselves with the nations,
PSA.106.35	and learnt their works.
PSA.106.36	They served their idols,
PSA.106.36	which became a snare to them.
PSA.106.37	Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
PSA.106.38	They shed innocent blood,
PSA.106.38	even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
PSA.106.38	whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.
PSA.106.38	The land was polluted with blood.
PSA.106.39	Thus they were defiled with their works,
PSA.106.39	and prostituted themselves in their deeds.
PSA.106.40	Therefore the 
PSA.106.40	He abhorred his inheritance.
PSA.106.41	He gave them into the hand of the nations.
PSA.106.41	Those who hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies also oppressed them.
PSA.106.42	They were brought into subjection under their hand.
PSA.106.43	He rescued them many times,
PSA.106.43	but they were rebellious in their counsel,
PSA.106.43	and were brought low in their iniquity.
PSA.106.44	Nevertheless he regarded their distress,
PSA.106.44	when he heard their cry.
PSA.106.45	He remembered for them his covenant,
PSA.106.45	and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
PSA.106.46	He made them also to be pitied
PSA.106.46	by all those who carried them captive.
PSA.106.47	Save us, 
PSA.106.47	gather us from amongst the nations,
PSA.106.47	to give thanks to your holy name,
PSA.106.47	to triumph in your praise!
PSA.106.48	Blessed be the 
PSA.106.48	from everlasting even to everlasting!
PSA.106.48	Let all the people say, “Amen.”
PSA.106.48	Praise the 
PSA.107.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.107.1	for his loving kindness endures forever.
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed by the 
PSA.107.2	whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
PSA.107.3	and gathered out of the lands,
PSA.107.3	from the east and from the west,
PSA.107.3	from the north and from the south.
PSA.107.4	They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.
PSA.107.4	They found no city to live in.
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty,
PSA.107.5	their soul fainted in them.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried to the 
PSA.107.6	and he delivered them out of their distresses,
PSA.107.7	he led them also by a straight way,
PSA.107.7	that they might go to a city to live in.
PSA.107.8	Let them praise the 
PSA.107.8	for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
PSA.107.9	For he satisfies the longing soul.
PSA.107.9	He fills the hungry soul with good.
PSA.107.10	Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
PSA.107.10	being bound in affliction and iron,
PSA.107.11	because they rebelled against the words of God,
PSA.107.11	and condemned the counsel of the Most High.
PSA.107.12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour.
PSA.107.12	They fell down, and there was no one to help.
PSA.107.13	Then they cried to the 
PSA.107.13	and he saved them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
PSA.107.14	and broke away their chains.
PSA.107.15	Let them praise the 
PSA.107.15	for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
PSA.107.16	For he has broken the gates of bronze,
PSA.107.16	and cut through bars of iron.
PSA.107.17	Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience,
PSA.107.17	and because of their iniquities.
PSA.107.18	Their soul abhors all kinds of food.
PSA.107.18	They draw near to the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cry to the 
PSA.107.19	he saves them out of their distresses.
PSA.107.20	He sends his word, and heals them,
PSA.107.20	and delivers them from their graves.
PSA.107.21	Let them praise the 
PSA.107.21	for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
PSA.107.22	Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
PSA.107.22	and declare his deeds with singing.
PSA.107.23	Those who go down to the sea in ships,
PSA.107.23	who do business in great waters;
PSA.107.24	These see the 
PSA.107.24	and his wonders in the deep.
PSA.107.25	For he commands, and raises the stormy wind,
PSA.107.25	which lifts up its waves.
PSA.107.26	They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.
PSA.107.26	Their soul melts away because of trouble.
PSA.107.27	They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,
PSA.107.27	and are at their wits’ end.
PSA.107.28	Then they cry to the 
PSA.107.28	and he brings them out of their distress.
PSA.107.29	He makes the storm a calm,
PSA.107.29	so that its waves are still.
PSA.107.30	Then they are glad because it is calm,
PSA.107.30	so he brings them to their desired haven.
PSA.107.31	Let them praise the 
PSA.107.31	for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,
PSA.107.32	and praise him in the seat of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He turns rivers into a desert,
PSA.107.33	water springs into a thirsty ground,
PSA.107.34	and a fruitful land into a salt waste,
PSA.107.34	for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
PSA.107.35	He turns a desert into a pool of water,
PSA.107.35	and a dry land into water springs.
PSA.107.36	There he makes the hungry live,
PSA.107.36	that they may prepare a city to live in,
PSA.107.37	sow fields, plant vineyards,
PSA.107.37	and reap the fruits of increase.
PSA.107.38	He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.
PSA.107.38	He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease.
PSA.107.39	Again, they are diminished and bowed down
PSA.107.39	through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
PSA.107.40	He pours contempt on princes,
PSA.107.40	and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.
PSA.107.41	Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction,
PSA.107.41	and increases their families like a flock.
PSA.107.42	The upright will see it, and be glad.
PSA.107.42	All the wicked will shut their mouths.
PSA.107.43	Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.
PSA.107.43	They will consider the loving kindnesses of the 
PSA.108.1	My heart is steadfast, God.
PSA.108.1	I will sing and I will make music with my soul.
PSA.108.2	Wake up, harp and lyre!
PSA.108.2	I will wake up the dawn.
PSA.108.3	I will give thanks to you, 
PSA.108.3	I will sing praises to you amongst the peoples.
PSA.108.4	For your loving kindness is great above the heavens.
PSA.108.4	Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
PSA.108.5	Be exalted, God, above the heavens!
PSA.108.5	Let your glory be over all the earth.
PSA.108.6	That your beloved may be delivered,
PSA.108.6	save with your right hand, and answer us.
PSA.108.7	God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph,
PSA.108.7	I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine.
PSA.108.8	Ephraim also is my helmet.
PSA.108.8	Judah is my sceptre.
PSA.108.9	Moab is my wash pot.
PSA.108.9	I will toss my sandal on Edom.
PSA.108.9	I will shout over Philistia.”
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me into the fortified city?
PSA.108.10	Who has led me to Edom?
PSA.108.11	Haven’t you rejected us, God?
PSA.108.11	You don’t go out, God, with our armies.
PSA.108.12	Give us help against the enemy,
PSA.108.12	for the help of man is vain.
PSA.108.13	Through God, we will do valiantly.
PSA.108.13	For it is he who will tread down our enemies.
PSA.109.1	God of my praise, don’t remain silent,
PSA.109.2	for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me.
PSA.109.2	They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.
PSA.109.3	They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,
PSA.109.3	and fought against me without a cause.
PSA.109.4	In return for my love, they are my adversaries;
PSA.109.4	but I am in prayer.
PSA.109.5	They have rewarded me evil for good,
PSA.109.5	and hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	Set a wicked man over him.
PSA.109.6	Let an adversary stand at his right hand.
PSA.109.7	When he is judged, let him come out guilty.
PSA.109.7	Let his prayer be turned into sin.
PSA.109.8	Let his days be few.
PSA.109.8	Let another take his office.
PSA.109.9	Let his children be fatherless,
PSA.109.9	and his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	Let his children be wandering beggars.
PSA.109.10	Let them be sought from their ruins.
PSA.109.11	Let the creditor seize all that he has.
PSA.109.11	Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labour.
PSA.109.12	Let there be no one to extend kindness to him,
PSA.109.12	neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	Let his posterity be cut off.
PSA.109.13	In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
PSA.109.14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by the 
PSA.109.14	Don’t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
PSA.109.15	Let them be before the 
PSA.109.15	that he may cut off their memory from the earth;
PSA.109.16	because he didn’t remember to show kindness,
PSA.109.16	but persecuted the poor and needy man,
PSA.109.16	the broken in heart, to kill them.
PSA.109.17	Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.
PSA.109.17	He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.
PSA.109.18	He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.
PSA.109.18	It came into his inward parts like water,
PSA.109.18	like oil into his bones.
PSA.109.19	Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,
PSA.109.19	for the belt that is always around him.
PSA.109.20	This is the reward of my adversaries from the 
PSA.109.20	of those who speak evil against my soul.
PSA.109.21	But deal with me, GOD the Lord,
PSA.109.21	because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;
PSA.109.22	for I am poor and needy.
PSA.109.22	My heart is wounded within me.
PSA.109.23	I fade away like an evening shadow.
PSA.109.23	I am shaken off like a locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak through fasting.
PSA.109.24	My body is thin and lacks fat.
PSA.109.25	I have also become a reproach to them.
PSA.109.25	When they see me, they shake their head.
PSA.109.26	Help me, 
PSA.109.26	Save me according to your loving kindness;
PSA.109.27	that they may know that this is your hand;
PSA.109.27	that you, 
PSA.109.28	They may curse, but you bless.
PSA.109.28	When they arise, they will be shamed,
PSA.109.28	but your servant shall rejoice.
PSA.109.29	Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonour.
PSA.109.29	Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
PSA.109.30	I will give great thanks to the 
PSA.109.30	Yes, I will praise him amongst the multitude.
PSA.109.31	For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,
PSA.109.31	to save him from those who judge his soul.
PSA.110.1	The 
PSA.110.1	until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet.”
PSA.110.2	The 
PSA.110.2	Rule amongst your enemies.
PSA.110.3	Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power, in holy array.
PSA.110.3	Out of the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth.
PSA.110.4	The 
PSA.110.4	“You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”
PSA.110.5	The Lord is at your right hand.
PSA.110.5	He will crush kings in the day of his wrath.
PSA.110.6	He will judge amongst the nations.
PSA.110.6	He will heap up dead bodies.
PSA.110.6	He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.
PSA.110.7	He will drink of the brook on the way;
PSA.110.7	therefore he will lift up his head.
PSA.111.1	Praise the 
PSA.111.1	I will give thanks to the 
PSA.111.1	in the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
PSA.111.2	The 
PSA.111.2	pondered by all those who delight in them.
PSA.111.3	His work is honour and majesty.
PSA.111.3	His righteousness endures forever.
PSA.111.4	He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered.
PSA.111.4	The 
PSA.111.5	He has given food to those who fear him.
PSA.111.5	He always remembers his covenant.
PSA.111.6	He has shown his people the power of his works,
PSA.111.6	in giving them the heritage of the nations.
PSA.111.7	The works of his hands are truth and justice.
PSA.111.7	All his precepts are sure.
PSA.111.8	They are established forever and ever.
PSA.111.8	They are done in truth and uprightness.
PSA.111.9	He has sent redemption to his people.
PSA.111.9	He has ordained his covenant forever.
PSA.111.9	His name is holy and awesome!
PSA.111.10	The fear of the 
PSA.111.10	All those who do his work have a good understanding.
PSA.111.10	His praise endures forever!
PSA.112.1	Praise the 
PSA.112.1	Blessed is the man who fears the 
PSA.112.1	who delights greatly in his commandments.
PSA.112.2	His offspring will be mighty in the land.
PSA.112.2	The generation of the upright will be blessed.
PSA.112.3	Wealth and riches are in his house.
PSA.112.3	His righteousness endures forever.
PSA.112.4	Light dawns in the darkness for the upright,
PSA.112.4	gracious, merciful, and righteous.
PSA.112.5	It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends.
PSA.112.5	He will maintain his cause in judgement.
PSA.112.6	For he will never be shaken.
PSA.112.6	The righteous will be remembered forever.
PSA.112.7	He will not be afraid of evil news.
PSA.112.7	His heart is steadfast, trusting in the 
PSA.112.8	His heart is established.
PSA.112.8	He will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries.
PSA.112.9	He has dispersed, he has given to the poor.
PSA.112.9	His righteousness endures forever.
PSA.112.9	His horn will be exalted with honour.
PSA.112.10	The wicked will see it, and be grieved.
PSA.112.10	He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away.
PSA.112.10	The desire of the wicked will perish.
PSA.113.1	Praise the 
PSA.113.1	Praise, you servants of the 
PSA.113.1	praise the 
PSA.113.2	Blessed be the 
PSA.113.2	from this time forward and forever more.
PSA.113.3	From the rising of the sun to its going down,
PSA.113.3	The 
PSA.113.4	The 
PSA.113.4	his glory above the heavens.
PSA.113.5	Who is like the 
PSA.113.5	who has his seat on high,
PSA.113.6	Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
PSA.113.7	He raises up the poor out of the dust.
PSA.113.7	Lifts up the needy from the ash heap,
PSA.113.8	that he may set him with princes,
PSA.113.8	even with the princes of his people.
PSA.113.9	He settles the barren woman in her home
PSA.113.9	as a joyful mother of children.
PSA.113.9	Praise the 
PSA.114.1	When Israel went out of Egypt,
PSA.114.1	the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language,
PSA.114.2	Judah became his sanctuary,
PSA.114.2	Israel his dominion.
PSA.114.3	The sea saw it, and fled.
PSA.114.3	The Jordan was driven back.
PSA.114.4	The mountains skipped like rams,
PSA.114.4	the little hills like lambs.
PSA.114.5	What was it, you sea, that you fled?
PSA.114.5	You Jordan, that you turned back?
PSA.114.6	You mountains, that you skipped like rams;
PSA.114.6	you little hills, like lambs?
PSA.114.7	Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord,
PSA.114.7	at the presence of the God of Jacob,
PSA.114.8	who turned the rock into a pool of water,
PSA.114.8	the flint into a spring of waters.
PSA.115.1	Not to us, 
PSA.115.1	but to your name give glory,
PSA.115.1	for your loving kindness, and for your truth’s sake.
PSA.115.2	Why should the nations say,
PSA.115.2	“Where is their God, now?”
PSA.115.3	But our God is in the heavens.
PSA.115.3	He does whatever he pleases.
PSA.115.4	Their idols are silver and gold,
PSA.115.4	the work of men’s hands.
PSA.115.5	They have mouths, but they don’t speak.
PSA.115.5	They have eyes, but they don’t see.
PSA.115.6	They have ears, but they don’t hear.
PSA.115.6	They have noses, but they don’t smell.
PSA.115.7	They have hands, but they don’t feel.
PSA.115.7	They have feet, but they don’t walk,
PSA.115.7	neither do they speak through their throat.
PSA.115.8	Those who make them will be like them;
PSA.115.8	yes, everyone who trusts in them.
PSA.115.9	Israel, trust in the 
PSA.115.9	He is their help and their shield.
PSA.115.10	House of Aaron, trust in the 
PSA.115.10	He is their help and their shield.
PSA.115.11	You who fear the 
PSA.115.11	He is their help and their shield.
PSA.115.12	The 
PSA.115.12	He will bless the house of Israel.
PSA.115.12	He will bless the house of Aaron.
PSA.115.13	He will bless those who fear the

PSA.119.156	Great are your tender mercies, 
PSA.119.156	Revive me according to your ordinances.
PSA.119.157	Many are my persecutors and my adversaries.
PSA.119.157	I haven’t swerved from your testimonies.
PSA.119.158	I look at the faithless with loathing,
PSA.119.158	because they don’t observe your word.
PSA.119.159	Consider how I love your precepts.
PSA.119.159	Revive me, 
PSA.119.160	All of your words are truth.
PSA.119.160	Every one of your righteous ordinances endures forever.
PSA.119.160	SIN AND SHIN
PSA.119.161	Princes have persecuted me without a cause,
PSA.119.161	but my heart stands in awe of your words.
PSA.119.162	I rejoice at your word,
PSA.119.162	as one who finds great plunder.
PSA.119.163	I hate and abhor falsehood.
PSA.119.163	I love your law.
PSA.119.164	Seven times a day, I praise you,
PSA.119.164	because of your righteous ordinances.
PSA.119.165	Those who love your law have great peace.
PSA.119.165	Nothing causes them to stumble.
PSA.119.166	I have hoped for your salvation, 
PSA.119.166	I have done your commandments.
PSA.119.167	My soul has observed your testimonies.
PSA.119.167	I love them exceedingly.
PSA.119.168	I have obeyed your precepts and your testimonies,
PSA.119.168	for all my ways are before you.
PSA.119.168	TAV
PSA.119.169	Let my cry come before you, 
PSA.119.169	Give me understanding according to your word.
PSA.119.170	Let my supplication come before you.
PSA.119.170	Deliver me according to your word.
PSA.119.171	Let my lips utter praise,
PSA.119.171	for you teach me your statutes.
PSA.119.172	Let my tongue sing of your word,
PSA.119.172	for all your commandments are righteousness.
PSA.119.173	Let your hand be ready to help me,
PSA.119.173	for I have chosen your precepts.
PSA.119.174	I have longed for your salvation, 
PSA.119.174	Your law is my delight.
PSA.119.175	Let my soul live, that I may praise you.
PSA.119.175	Let your ordinances help me.
PSA.119.176	I have gone astray like a lost sheep.
PSA.119.176	Seek your servant, for I don’t forget your commandments.
PSA.120.1	In my distress, I cried to the 
PSA.120.1	He answered me.
PSA.120.2	Deliver my soul, 
PSA.120.2	from a deceitful tongue.
PSA.120.3	What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,
PSA.120.3	you deceitful tongue?
PSA.120.4	Sharp arrows of the mighty,
PSA.120.4	with coals of juniper.
PSA.120.5	Woe is me, that I live in Meshech,
PSA.120.5	that I dwell amongst the tents of Kedar!
PSA.120.6	My soul has had her dwelling too long
PSA.120.6	with him who hates peace.
PSA.120.7	I am for peace,
PSA.120.7	but when I speak, they are for war.
PSA.121.1	I will lift up my eyes to the hills.
PSA.121.1	Where does my help come from?
PSA.121.2	My help comes from the 
PSA.121.2	who made heaven and earth.
PSA.121.3	He will not allow your foot to be moved.
PSA.121.3	He who keeps you will not slumber.
PSA.121.4	Behold, he who keeps Israel
PSA.121.4	will neither slumber nor sleep.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.6	The sun will not harm you by day,
PSA.121.6	nor the moon by night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.7	He will keep your soul.
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.121.8	from this time forward, and forever more.
PSA.122.1	I was glad when they said to me,
PSA.122.1	“Let’s go to the 
PSA.122.2	Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem,
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together,
PSA.122.4	where the tribes go up, even the 
PSA.122.4	according to an ordinance for Israel,
PSA.122.4	to give thanks to the 
PSA.122.5	For there are set thrones for judgement,
PSA.122.5	the thrones of David’s house.
PSA.122.6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
PSA.122.6	Those who love you will prosper.
PSA.122.7	Peace be within your walls,
PSA.122.7	and prosperity within your palaces.
PSA.122.8	For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes,
PSA.122.8	I will now say, “Peace be within you.”
PSA.122.9	For the sake of the house of the 
PSA.122.9	I will seek your good.
PSA.123.1	I lift up my eyes to you,
PSA.123.1	you who sit in the heavens.
PSA.123.2	Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,
PSA.123.2	as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress;
PSA.123.2	so our eyes look to the 
PSA.123.2	until he has mercy on us.
PSA.123.3	Have mercy on us, 
PSA.123.3	for we have endured much contempt.
PSA.123.4	Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease,
PSA.123.4	with the contempt of the proud.
PSA.124.1	If it had not been the 
PSA.124.1	let Israel now say,
PSA.124.2	if it had not been the 
PSA.124.2	when men rose up against us;
PSA.124.3	then they would have swallowed us up alive,
PSA.124.3	when their wrath was kindled against us;
PSA.124.4	then the waters would have overwhelmed us,
PSA.124.4	the stream would have gone over our soul;
PSA.124.5	then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
PSA.124.6	Blessed be the 
PSA.124.6	who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
PSA.124.7	Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare.
PSA.124.7	The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
PSA.124.8	Our help is in the 
PSA.124.8	who made heaven and earth.
PSA.125.1	Those who trust in the 
PSA.125.1	which can’t be moved, but remains forever.
PSA.125.2	As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
PSA.125.2	so the 
PSA.125.3	For the sceptre of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous;
PSA.125.3	so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil.
PSA.125.4	Do good, 
PSA.125.4	to those who are upright in their hearts.
PSA.125.5	But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways,
PSA.125.5	The 
PSA.125.5	Peace be on Israel.
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.1	we were like those who dream.
PSA.126.2	Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
PSA.126.2	and our tongue with singing.
PSA.126.2	Then they said amongst the nations,
PSA.126.2	“The 
PSA.126.3	The 
PSA.126.3	and we are glad.
PSA.126.4	Restore our fortunes again, 
PSA.126.4	like the streams in the Negev.
PSA.126.5	Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.
PSA.126.6	He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,
PSA.126.6	will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
PSA.127.1	Unless the 
PSA.127.1	they who build it labour in vain.
PSA.127.1	Unless the 
PSA.127.1	the watchman guards it in vain.
PSA.127.2	It is vain for you to rise up early,
PSA.127.2	to stay up late,
PSA.127.2	eating the bread of toil,
PSA.127.2	for he gives sleep to his loved ones.
PSA.127.3	Behold, children are a heritage of the 
PSA.127.3	The fruit of the womb is his reward.
PSA.127.4	As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
PSA.127.4	so are the children of youth.
PSA.127.5	Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.
PSA.127.5	They won’t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
PSA.128.1	Blessed is everyone who fears the 
PSA.128.1	who walks in his ways.
PSA.128.2	For you will eat the labour of your hands.
PSA.128.2	You will be happy, and it will be well with you.
PSA.128.3	Your wife will be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house,
PSA.128.3	your children like olive shoots around your table.
PSA.128.4	Behold, this is how the man who fears the 
PSA.128.5	May the 
PSA.128.5	and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
PSA.128.6	Yes, may you see your children’s children.
PSA.128.6	Peace be upon Israel.
PSA.129.1	Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up.
PSA.129.1	Let Israel now say,
PSA.129.2	many times they have afflicted me from my youth up,
PSA.129.2	yet they have not prevailed against me.
PSA.129.3	The ploughers ploughed on my back.
PSA.129.3	They made their furrows long.
PSA.129.4	The 
PSA.129.4	He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
PSA.129.5	Let them be disappointed and turned backward,
PSA.129.5	all those who hate Zion.
PSA.129.6	Let them be as the grass on the housetops,
PSA.129.6	which withers before it grows up,
PSA.129.7	with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand,
PSA.129.7	nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.
PSA.129.8	Neither do those who go by say,
PSA.129.8	“The blessing of the 
PSA.129.8	We bless you in the 
PSA.130.1	Out of the depths I have cried to you, 
PSA.130.2	Lord, hear my voice.
PSA.130.2	Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.
PSA.130.3	If you, 
PSA.130.3	Lord, who could stand?
PSA.130.4	But there is forgiveness with you,
PSA.130.4	therefore you are feared.
PSA.130.5	I wait for the 
PSA.130.5	My soul waits.
PSA.130.5	I hope in his word.
PSA.130.6	My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning,
PSA.130.6	more than watchmen for the morning.
PSA.130.7	Israel, hope in the 
PSA.130.7	for there is loving kindness with the 
PSA.130.7	Abundant redemption is with him.
PSA.130.8	He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
PSA.131.1	, my heart isn’t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty;
PSA.131.1	nor do I concern myself with great matters,
PSA.131.1	or things too wonderful for me.
PSA.131.2	Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul,
PSA.131.2	like a weaned child with his mother,
PSA.131.2	like a weaned child is my soul within me.
PSA.131.3	Israel, hope in the 
PSA.131.3	from this time forward and forever more.
PSA.132.1	, remember David and all his affliction,
PSA.132.2	how he swore to the 
PSA.132.2	and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
PSA.132.3	“Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,
PSA.132.3	nor go up into my bed;
PSA.132.4	I will not give sleep to my eyes,
PSA.132.4	or slumber to my eyelids;
PSA.132.5	until I find out a place for the 
PSA.132.5	a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
PSA.132.6	Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah.
PSA.132.6	We found it in the field of Jaar:
PSA.132.7	“We will go into his dwelling place.
PSA.132.7	We will worship at his footstool.
PSA.132.8	Arise, 
PSA.132.8	you, and the ark of your strength.
PSA.132.9	Let your priests be clothed with righteousness.
PSA.132.9	Let your saints shout for joy!”
PSA.132.10	For your servant David’s sake,
PSA.132.10	don’t turn away the face of your anointed one.
PSA.132.11	The 
PSA.132.11	He will not turn from it:
PSA.132.11	“I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.
PSA.132.12	If your children will keep my covenant,
PSA.132.12	my testimony that I will teach them,
PSA.132.12	their children also will sit on your throne forever more.”
PSA.132.13	For the 
PSA.132.13	He has desired it for his habitation.
PSA.132.14	“This is my resting place forever.
PSA.132.14	I will live here, for I have desired it.
PSA.132.15	I will abundantly bless her provision.
PSA.132.15	I will satisfy her poor with bread.
PSA.132.16	I will also clothe her priests with salvation.
PSA.132.16	Her saints will shout aloud for joy.
PSA.132.17	I will make the horn of David to bud there.
PSA.132.17	I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.
PSA.132.18	I will clothe his enemies with shame,
PSA.132.18	but on himself, his crown will shine.”
PSA.133.1	See how good and how pleasant it is
PSA.133.1	for brothers to live together in unity!
PSA.133.2	It is like the precious oil on the head,
PSA.133.2	that ran down on the beard,
PSA.133.2	even Aaron’s beard,
PSA.133.2	that came down on the edge of his robes,
PSA.133.3	like the dew of Hermon,
PSA.133.3	that comes down on the hills of Zion;
PSA.133.3	for there the 
PSA.133.3	even life forever more.
PSA.134.1	Look! Praise the 
PSA.134.1	who stand by night in the 
PSA.134.2	Lift up your hands in the sanctuary.
PSA.134.2	Praise the 
PSA.134.3	May the 
PSA.134.3	even he who made heaven and earth.
PSA.135.1	Praise the 
PSA.135.1	Praise the 
PSA.135.1	Praise him, you servants of the 
PSA.135.2	you who stand in the 
PSA.135.2	in the courts of our God’s house.
PSA.135.3	Praise the 
PSA.135.3	Sing praises to his name, for that is pleasant.
PSA.135.4	For the 
PSA.135.4	Israel for his own possession.
PSA.135.5	For I know that the 
PSA.135.5	that our Lord is above all gods.
PSA.135.6	Whatever the 
PSA.135.6	in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.
PSA.135.7	He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth.
PSA.135.7	He makes lightnings with the rain.
PSA.135.7	He brings the wind out of his treasuries.
PSA.135.8	He struck the firstborn of Egypt,
PSA.135.8	both of man and animal.
PSA.135.9	He sent signs and wonders into the middle of you, Egypt,
PSA.135.9	on Pharaoh, and on all his servants.
PSA.135.10	He struck many nations,
PSA.135.10	and killed mighty kings,
PSA.135.11	Sihon king of the Amorites,
PSA.135.11	Og king of Bashan,
PSA.135.11	and all the kingdoms of Canaan,
PSA.135.12	and gave their land for a heritage,
PSA.135.12	a heritage to Israel, his people.
PSA.135.13	Your name, 
PSA.135.13	your renown, 
PSA.135.14	For the 
PSA.135.14	and have compassion on his servants.
PSA.135.15	The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
PSA.135.15	the work of men’s hands.
PSA.135.16	They have mouths, but they can’t speak.
PSA.135.16	They have eyes, but they can’t see.
PSA.135.17	They have ears, but they can’t hear,
PSA.135.17	neither is there any breath in their mouths.
PSA.135.18	Those who make them will be like them,
PSA.135.18	yes, everyone who trusts in them.
PSA.135.19	House of Israel, praise the 
PSA.135.19	House of Aaron, praise the 
PSA.135.20	House of Levi, praise the 
PSA.135.20	You who fear the 
PSA.135.21	Blessed be the 
PSA.135.21	who dwells at Jerusalem.
PSA.135.21	Praise the 
PSA.136.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.136.1	for his loving kindness endures forever.

PSA.136.3	for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA.136.4	to him who alone does great wonders;
PSA.136.4	for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA.136.5	to him who by understanding made the heavens;
PSA.136.5	for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA.136.6	to him who spread out the earth above the waters;
PSA.136.6	for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA.136.7	to him who made the great lights;
PSA.136.7	for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA.136.8	the sun to rule by day;
PSA.136.8	for his loving kindness endures forever;
PSA.136.9	the moon and stars to rule by night;
PSA.136.9	for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA.136.10	to him who struck down the Egyptian firstborn;
PSA.136.10	for his loving kindness endures forever;
PSA.136.11	and brought out Israel from amongst them;
PSA.136.11	for his loving kindness endures forever;
PSA.136.12	with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm;
PSA.136.12	for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA.136.13	to him who divided the Red Sea apart;
PSA.136.13	for his loving kindness endures forever;
PSA.136.14	and made Israel to pass through the middle of it;
PSA.136.14	for his loving kindness endures forever;
PSA.136.15	but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea;
PSA.136.15	for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA.136.16	to him who led his people through the wilderness;
PSA.136.16	for his loving kindness endures forever:

PSA.136.19	for his loving kindness endures forever;
PSA.136.20	Og king of Bashan;
PSA.136.20	for his loving kindness endures forever;
PSA.136.21	and gave their land as an inheritance;
PSA.136.21	for his loving kindness endures forever;
PSA.136.22	even a heritage to Israel his servant;
PSA.136.22	for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA.136.23	who remembered us in our low estate;
PSA.136.23	for his loving kindness endures forever;
PSA.136.24	and has delivered us from our adversaries;
PSA.136.24	for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA.136.25	who gives food to every creature;
PSA.136.25	for his loving kindness endures forever.
PSA.136.26	Oh give thanks to the God of heaven;
PSA.136.26	for his loving kindness endures forever.
PSA.137.1	By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.
PSA.137.1	Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
PSA.137.2	On the willows in that land,
PSA.137.2	we hung up our harps.
PSA.137.3	For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.
PSA.137.3	Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:
PSA.137.3	“Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”
PSA.137.4	How can we sing the 
PSA.137.5	If I forget you, Jerusalem,
PSA.137.5	let my right hand forget its skill.
PSA.137.6	Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don’t remember you,
PSA.137.6	if I don’t prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.
PSA.137.7	Remember, 
PSA.137.7	who said, “Raze it!
PSA.137.7	Raze it even to its foundation!”
PSA.137.8	Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,
PSA.137.8	he will be happy who repays you,
PSA.137.8	as you have done to us.
PSA.137.9	Happy shall he be,
PSA.137.9	who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
PSA.138.1	I will give you thanks with my whole heart.
PSA.138.1	Before the gods,
PSA.138.2	I will bow down towards your holy temple,
PSA.138.2	and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth;
PSA.138.2	for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
PSA.138.3	In the day that I called, you answered me.
PSA.138.3	You encouraged me with strength in my soul.
PSA.138.4	All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, 
PSA.138.4	for they have heard the words of your mouth.
PSA.138.5	Yes, they will sing of the ways of the 
PSA.138.5	for the 
PSA.138.6	For though the 
PSA.138.6	but he knows the proud from afar.
PSA.138.7	Though I walk in the middle of trouble, you will revive me.
PSA.138.7	You will stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies.
PSA.138.7	Your right hand will save me.
PSA.138.8	The 
PSA.138.8	Your loving kindness, 
PSA.138.8	Don’t forsake the works of your own hands.
PSA.139.1	, you have searched me,
PSA.139.1	and you know me.
PSA.139.2	You know my sitting down and my rising up.
PSA.139.2	You perceive my thoughts from afar.
PSA.139.3	You search out my path and my lying down,
PSA.139.3	and are acquainted with all my ways.
PSA.139.4	For there is not a word on my tongue,
PSA.139.4	but, behold, 
PSA.139.5	You hem me in behind and before.
PSA.139.5	You laid your hand on me.
PSA.139.6	This knowledge is beyond me.
PSA.139.6	It’s lofty.
PSA.139.6	I can’t attain it.
PSA.139.7	Where could I go from your Spirit?
PSA.139.7	Or where could I flee from your presence?
PSA.139.8	If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.
PSA.139.8	If I make my bed in Sheol,
PSA.139.9	If I take the wings of the dawn,
PSA.139.9	and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea,
PSA.139.10	even there your hand will lead me,
PSA.139.10	and your right hand will hold me.
PSA.139.11	If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me.
PSA.139.11	The light around me will be night,”
PSA.139.12	even the darkness doesn’t hide from you,
PSA.139.12	but the night shines as the day.
PSA.139.12	The darkness is like light to you.
PSA.139.13	For you formed my inmost being.
PSA.139.13	You knit me together in my mother’s womb.
PSA.139.14	I will give thanks to you,
PSA.139.14	for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
PSA.139.14	Your works are wonderful.
PSA.139.14	My soul knows that very well.
PSA.139.15	My frame wasn’t hidden from you,
PSA.139.15	when I was made in secret,
PSA.139.15	woven together in the depths of the earth.
PSA.139.16	Your eyes saw my body.
PSA.139.16	In your book they were all written,
PSA.139.16	the days that were ordained for me,
PSA.139.16	when as yet there were none of them.
PSA.139.17	How precious to me are your thoughts, God!
PSA.139.17	How vast is their sum!
PSA.139.18	If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.
PSA.139.18	When I wake up, I am still with you.
PSA.139.19	If only you, God, would kill the wicked.
PSA.139.19	Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!
PSA.139.20	For they speak against you wickedly.
PSA.139.20	Your enemies take your name in vain.

PSA.140.5	The proud have hidden a snare for me,
PSA.140.5	they have spread the cords of a net by the path.
PSA.140.5	They have set traps for me. 
PSA.140.6	I said to the 
PSA.140.6	Listen to the cry of my petitions, 
PSA.140.7	, the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
PSA.140.7	you have covered my head in the day of battle.

PSA.140.10	Let burning coals fall on them.
PSA.140.10	Let them be thrown into the fire,
PSA.140.10	into miry pits, from where they never rise.

PSA.141.1	Come to me quickly!
PSA.141.1	Listen to my voice when I call to you.
PSA.141.2	Let my prayer be set before you like incense;
PSA.141.2	the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.
PSA.141.3	Set a watch, 
PSA.141.3	Keep the door of my lips.
PSA.141.4	Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing,
PSA.141.4	to practise deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity.
PSA.141.4	Don’t let me eat of their delicacies.
PSA.141.5	Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness;

PSA.143.8	Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,
PSA.143.8	for I lift up my soul to you.
PSA.143.9	Deliver me, 
PSA.143.9	I flee to you to hide me.
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do your will,
PSA.143.10	for you are my God.
PSA.143.10	Your Spirit is good.

PSA.144.1	who teaches my hands to war,
PSA.144.1	and my fingers to battle:
PSA.144.2	my loving kindness, my fortress,
PSA.144.2	my high tower, my deliverer,
PSA.144.2	my shield, and he in whom I take refuge,
PSA.144.2	who subdues my people under me.
PSA.144.3	, what is man, that you care for him?
PSA.144.3	Or the son of man, that you think of him?
PSA.144.4	Man is like a breath.
PSA.144.4	His days are like a shadow that passes away.
PSA.144.5	Part your heavens, 
PSA.144.5	Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.
PSA.144.6	Throw out lightning, and scatter them.
PSA.144.6	Send out your arrows, and rout them.
PSA.144.7	Stretch out your hand from above,
PSA.144.7	rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters,
PSA.144.7	out of the hands of foreigners,
PSA.144.8	whose mouths speak deceit,
PSA.144.8	whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
PSA.144.9	I will sing a new song to you, God.
PSA.144.9	On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you.
PSA.144.10	You are he who gives salvation to kings,
PSA.144.10	who rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword.
PSA.144.11	Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners,

PSA.151_1.1	I tended my father’s sheep.
PSA.151_1.2	My hands formed a musical instrument,

PSA.151_1.3	Who shall tell my Lord?
PSA.151_1.3	The Lord himself, he himself hears.
PSA.151_1.4	He sent forth his angel and took me from my father’s sheep,
PSA.151_1.4	and he anointed me with his anointing oil.
PSA.151_1.5	My brothers were handsome and tall;
PSA.151_1.5	but the Lord didn’t take pleasure in them.
PSA.151_1.6	I went out to meet the Philistine,
PSA.151_1.6	and he cursed me by his idols.

PSA.151_1.7	and removed reproach from the children of Israel.
PRO.1.1	The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:
PRO.1.2	to know wisdom and instruction;
PRO.1.2	to discern the words of understanding;
PRO.1.3	to receive instruction in wise dealing,
PRO.1.3	in righteousness, justice, and equity;
PRO.1.4	to give prudence to the simple,
PRO.1.4	knowledge and discretion to the young man:
PRO.1.5	that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;
PRO.1.5	that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:
PRO.1.6	to understand a proverb and parables,
PRO.1.6	the words and riddles of the wise.
PRO.1.7	The fear of the 
PRO.1.7	but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
PRO.1.8	My son, listen to your father’s instruction,
PRO.1.8	and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching:
PRO.1.9	for they will be a garland to grace your head,
PRO.1.9	and chains around your neck.
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinners entice you,
PRO.1.10	don’t consent.
PRO.1.11	If they say, “Come with us.
PRO.1.11	Let’s lie in wait for blood.
PRO.1.11	Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.
PRO.1.12	Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol,
PRO.1.12	and whole, like those who go down into the pit.
PRO.1.13	We’ll find all valuable wealth.
PRO.1.13	We’ll fill our houses with plunder.
PRO.1.14	You shall cast your lot amongst us.
PRO.1.14	We’ll all have one purse.”
PRO.1.15	My son, don’t walk on the path with them.
PRO.1.15	Keep your foot from their path,
PRO.1.16	for their feet run to evil.
PRO.1.16	They hurry to shed blood.
PRO.1.17	For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird;
PRO.1.18	but these lay in wait for their own blood.
PRO.1.18	They lurk secretly for their own lives.
PRO.1.19	So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.

PRO.1.21	At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:
PRO.1.22	“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?

PRO.1.22	and fools hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	Turn at my reproof.
PRO.1.23	Behold,
PRO.1.23	I will make known my words to you.
PRO.1.24	Because I have called, and you have refused;
PRO.1.24	I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;
PRO.1.25	but you have ignored all my counsel,
PRO.1.25	and wanted none of my reproof;
PRO.1.26	I also will laugh at your disaster.
PRO.1.26	I will mock when calamity overtakes you,
PRO.1.27	when calamity overtakes you like a storm,
PRO.1.27	when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind,
PRO.1.27	when distress and anguish come on you.
PRO.1.28	Then they will call on me, but I will not answer.

PRO.1.32	For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.
PRO.1.32	The careless ease of fools will destroy them.
PRO.1.33	But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,
PRO.1.33	and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”
PRO.2.1	My son, if you will receive my words,
PRO.2.1	and store up my commandments within you,
PRO.2.2	so as to turn your ear to wisdom,
PRO.2.2	and apply your heart to understanding;
PRO.2.3	yes, if you call out for discernment,
PRO.2.3	and lift up your voice for understanding;
PRO.2.4	if you seek her as silver,
PRO.2.4	and search for her as for hidden treasures:
PRO.2.5	then you will understand the fear of the

PRO.2.14	and delight in the perverseness of evil,
PRO.2.15	who are crooked in their ways,
PRO.2.15	and wayward in their paths,
PRO.2.16	to deliver you from the strange woman,
PRO.2.16	even from the foreigner who flatters with her words,
PRO.2.17	who forsakes the friend of her youth,
PRO.2.17	and forgets the covenant of her God;
PRO.2.18	for her house leads down to death,
PRO.2.18	her paths to the departed spirits.
PRO.2.19	None who go to her return again,
PRO.2.19	neither do they attain to the paths of life.
PRO.2.20	So you may walk in the way of good men,
PRO.2.20	and keep the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For the upright will dwell in the land.
PRO.2.21	The perfect will remain in it.
PRO.2.22	But the wicked will be cut off from the land.
PRO.2.22	The treacherous will be rooted out of it.
PRO.3.1	My son, don’t forget my teaching;
PRO.3.1	but let your heart keep my commandments:
PRO.3.2	for they will add to you length of days,
PRO.3.2	years of life, and peace.
PRO.3.3	Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you.
PRO.3.3	Bind them around your neck.
PRO.3.3	Write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.3.4	So you will find favour,
PRO.3.4	and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the 
PRO.3.5	and don’t lean on your own understanding.
PRO.3.6	In all your ways acknowledge him,
PRO.3.6	and he will make your paths straight.
PRO.3.7	Don’t be wise in your own eyes.
PRO.3.7	Fear the 
PRO.3.8	It will be health to your body,
PRO.3.8	and nourishment to your bones.
PRO.3.9	Honour the 
PRO.3.9	with the first fruits of all your increase:
PRO.3.10	so your barns will be filled with plenty,
PRO.3.10	and your vats will overflow with new wine.
PRO.3.11	My son, don’t despise the 
PRO.3.11	neither be weary of his correction;
PRO.3.12	for whom the 
PRO.3.12	even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.
PRO.3.13	Happy is the man who finds wisdom,
PRO.3.13	the man who gets understanding.
PRO.3.14	For her good profit is better than getting silver,
PRO.3.14	and her return is better than fine gold.
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than rubies.
PRO.3.15	None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.
PRO.3.16	Length of days is in her right hand.
PRO.3.16	In her left hand are riches and honour.
PRO.3.17	Her ways are ways of pleasantness.
PRO.3.17	All her paths are peace.
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.
PRO.3.18	Happy is everyone who retains her.
PRO.3.19	By wisdom the 
PRO.3.19	By understanding, he established the heavens.
PRO.3.20	By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,
PRO.3.20	and the skies drop down the dew.
PRO.3.21	My son, let them not depart from your eyes.
PRO.3.21	Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
PRO.3.22	so they will be life to your soul,
PRO.3.22	and grace for your neck.
PRO.3.23	Then you shall walk in your way securely.
PRO.3.23	Your foot won’t stumble.
PRO.3.24	When you lie down, you will not be afraid.
PRO.3.24	Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.
PRO.3.25	Don’t be afraid of sudden fear,
PRO.3.25	neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes;
PRO.3.26	for the 
PRO.3.26	and will keep your foot from being taken.
PRO.3.27	Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due,
PRO.3.27	when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
PRO.3.28	Don’t say to your neighbour, “Go, and come again;
PRO.3.28	tomorrow I will give it to you,”
PRO.3.28	when you have it by you.
PRO.3.29	Don’t devise evil against your neighbour,
PRO.3.29	since he dwells securely by you.
PRO.3.30	Don’t strive with a man without cause,
PRO.3.30	if he has done you no harm.
PRO.3.31	Don’t envy the man of violence.
PRO.3.31	Choose none of his ways.
PRO.3.32	For the perverse is an abomination to the 
PRO.3.32	but his friendship is with the upright.
PRO.3.33	The 
PRO.3.33	but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.
PRO.3.34	Surely he mocks the mockers,
PRO.3.34	but he gives grace to the humble.
PRO.3.35	The wise will inherit glory,
PRO.3.35	but shame will be the promotion of fools.
PRO.4.1	Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction.
PRO.4.1	Pay attention and know understanding;
PRO.4.2	for I give you sound learning.
PRO.4.2	Don’t forsake my law.
PRO.4.3	For I was a son to my father,
PRO.4.3	tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.
PRO.4.4	He taught me, and said to me:
PRO.4.4	“Let your heart retain my words.
PRO.4.4	Keep my commandments, and live.
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom.
PRO.4.5	Get understanding.
PRO.4.5	Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth.
PRO.4.6	Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you.
PRO.4.6	Love her, and she will keep you.
PRO.4.7	Wisdom is supreme.
PRO.4.7	Get wisdom.
PRO.4.7	Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.
PRO.4.8	Esteem her, and she will exalt you.
PRO.4.8	She will bring you to honour when you embrace her.
PRO.4.9	She will give to your head a garland of grace.
PRO.4.9	She will deliver a crown of splendour to you.”
PRO.4.10	Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.
PRO.4.10	The years of your life will be many.
PRO.4.11	I have taught you in the way of wisdom.
PRO.4.11	I have led you in straight paths.
PRO.4.12	When you go, your steps will not be hampered.
PRO.4.12	When you run, you will not stumble.
PRO.4.13	Take firm hold of instruction.
PRO.4.13	Don’t let her go.
PRO.4.13	Keep her, for she is your life.
PRO.4.14	Don’t enter into the path of the wicked.
PRO.4.14	Don’t walk in the way of evil men.
PRO.4.15	Avoid it, and don’t pass by it.
PRO.4.15	Turn from it, and pass on.
PRO.4.16	For they don’t sleep unless they do evil.
PRO.4.16	Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.
PRO.4.17	For they eat the bread of wickedness
PRO.4.17	and drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light
PRO.4.18	that shines more and more until the perfect day.
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked is like darkness.
PRO.4.19	They don’t know what they stumble over.
PRO.4.20	My son, attend to my words.
PRO.4.20	Turn your ear to my sayings.
PRO.4.21	Let them not depart from your eyes.
PRO.4.21	Keep them in the centre of your heart.
PRO.4.22	For they are life to those who find them,
PRO.4.22	and health to their whole body.
PRO.4.23	Keep your heart with all diligence,
PRO.4.23	for out of it is the wellspring of life.
PRO.4.24	Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.
PRO.4.24	Put corrupt lips far from you.
PRO.4.25	Let your eyes look straight ahead.
PRO.4.25	Fix your gaze directly before you.
PRO.4.26	Make the path of your feet level.
PRO.4.26	Let all of your ways be established.
PRO.4.27	Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left.
PRO.4.27	Remove your foot from evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, pay attention to my wisdom.
PRO.5.1	Turn your ear to my understanding,
PRO.5.2	that you may maintain discretion,
PRO.5.2	that your lips may preserve knowledge.
PRO.5.3	For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.
PRO.5.3	Her mouth is smoother than oil,
PRO.5.4	but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,
PRO.5.4	and as sharp as a two-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death.
PRO.5.5	Her steps lead straight to Sheol.
PRO.5.6	She gives no thought to the way of life.
PRO.5.6	Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.
PRO.5.7	Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.
PRO.5.7	Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.
PRO.5.8	Remove your way far from her.
PRO.5.8	Don’t come near the door of her house,
PRO.5.9	lest you give your honour to others,
PRO.5.9	and your years to the cruel one;
PRO.5.10	lest strangers feast on your wealth,
PRO.5.10	and your labours enrich another man’s house.
PRO.5.11	You will groan at your latter end,
PRO.5.11	when your flesh and your body are consumed,
PRO.5.12	and say, “How I have hated instruction,
PRO.5.12	and my heart despised reproof.
PRO.5.13	I haven’t obeyed the voice of my teachers,
PRO.5.13	nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!
PRO.5.14	I have come to the brink of utter ruin,
PRO.5.14	amongst the gathered assembly.”
PRO.5.15	Drink water out of your own cistern,
PRO.5.15	running water out of your own well.
PRO.5.16	Should your springs overflow in the streets,
PRO.5.16	streams of water in the public squares?
PRO.5.17	Let them be for yourself alone,
PRO.5.17	not for strangers with you.
PRO.5.18	Let your spring be blessed.
PRO.5.18	Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
PRO.5.19	A loving doe and a graceful deer—
PRO.5.19	let her breasts satisfy you at all times.
PRO.5.19	Be captivated always with her love.
PRO.5.20	For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?
PRO.5.20	Why embrace the bosom of another?
PRO.5.21	For the ways of man are before the 
PRO.5.21	He examines all his paths.
PRO.5.22	The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.
PRO.5.22	The cords of his sin hold him firmly.
PRO.5.23	He will die for lack of instruction.
PRO.5.23	In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.
PRO.6.1	My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbour,
PRO.6.1	if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,
PRO.6.2	you are trapped by the words of your mouth;
PRO.6.2	you are ensnared with the words of your mouth.
PRO.6.3	Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,
PRO.6.3	since you have come into the hand of your neighbour.
PRO.6.3	Go, humble yourself.
PRO.6.3	Press your plea with your neighbour.
PRO.6.4	Give no sleep to your eyes,
PRO.6.4	nor slumber to your eyelids.
PRO.6.5	Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
PRO.6.5	like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, you sluggard.
PRO.6.6	Consider her ways, and be wise;
PRO.6.7	which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
PRO.6.8	provides her bread in the summer,
PRO.6.8	and gathers her food in the harvest.
PRO.6.9	How long will you sleep, sluggard?
PRO.6.9	When will you arise out of your sleep?
PRO.6.10	A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.6.10	a little folding of the hands to sleep:
PRO.6.11	so your poverty will come as a robber,
PRO.6.11	and your scarcity as an armed man.
PRO.6.12	A worthless person, a man of iniquity,
PRO.6.12	is he who walks with a perverse mouth,
PRO.6.13	who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,
PRO.6.13	who motions with his fingers,
PRO.6.14	in whose heart is perverseness,
PRO.6.14	who devises evil continually,
PRO.6.14	who always sows discord.
PRO.6.15	Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.
PRO.6.15	He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.
PRO.6.16	There are six things which the 
PRO.6.16	yes, seven which are an abomination to him:
PRO.6.17	arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	a heart that devises wicked schemes,
PRO.6.18	feet that are swift in running to mischief,
PRO.6.19	a false witness who utters lies,
PRO.6.19	and he who sows discord amongst brothers.
PRO.6.20	My son, keep your father’s commandment,
PRO.6.20	and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.
PRO.6.21	Bind them continually on your heart.
PRO.6.21	Tie them around your neck.
PRO.6.22	When you walk, it will lead you.
PRO.6.22	When you sleep, it will watch over you.
PRO.6.22	When you awake, it will talk with you.
PRO.6.23	For the commandment is a lamp,
PRO.6.23	and the law is light.
PRO.6.23	Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
PRO.6.24	to keep you from the immoral woman,
PRO.6.24	from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.
PRO.6.25	Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart,
PRO.6.25	neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.
PRO.6.26	For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.
PRO.6.26	The adulteress hunts for your precious life.
PRO.6.27	Can a man scoop fire into his lap,
PRO.6.27	and his clothes not be burnt?
PRO.6.28	Or can one walk on hot coals,
PRO.6.28	and his feet not be scorched?
PRO.6.29	So is he who goes in to his neighbour’s wife.
PRO.6.29	Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.
PRO.6.30	Men don’t despise a thief
PRO.6.30	if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry;
PRO.6.31	but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.
PRO.6.31	He shall give all the wealth of his house.
PRO.6.32	He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.
PRO.6.32	He who does it destroys his own soul.
PRO.6.33	He will get wounds and dishonour.
PRO.6.33	His reproach will not be wiped away.
PRO.6.34	For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.
PRO.6.34	He won’t spare in the day of vengeance.
PRO.6.35	He won’t regard any ransom,
PRO.6.35	neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words.
PRO.7.1	Lay up my commandments within you.
PRO.7.2	Keep my commandments and live!
PRO.7.2	Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.
PRO.7.3	Bind them on your fingers.
PRO.7.3	Write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.7.4	Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.”
PRO.7.4	Call understanding your relative,
PRO.7.5	that they may keep you from the strange woman,
PRO.7.5	from the foreigner who flatters with her words.
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house,
PRO.7.6	I looked out through my lattice.
PRO.7.7	I saw amongst the simple ones.
PRO.7.7	I discerned amongst the youths a young man void of understanding,
PRO.7.8	passing through the street near her corner,
PRO.7.8	he went the way to her house,
PRO.7.9	in the twilight, in the evening of the day,
PRO.7.9	in the middle of the night and in the darkness.
PRO.7.10	Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,
PRO.7.10	and with crafty intent.
PRO.7.11	She is loud and defiant.
PRO.7.11	Her feet don’t stay in her house.
PRO.7.12	Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,
PRO.7.12	and lurking at every corner.
PRO.7.13	So she caught him, and kissed him.
PRO.7.13	With an impudent face she said to him:
PRO.7.14	“Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.
PRO.7.14	Today I have paid my vows.
PRO.7.15	Therefore I came out to meet you,
PRO.7.15	to diligently seek your face,
PRO.7.15	and I have found you.
PRO.7.16	I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,
PRO.7.16	with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning.
PRO.7.18	Let’s solace ourselves with loving.
PRO.7.19	For my husband isn’t at home.
PRO.7.19	He has gone on a long journey.
PRO.7.20	He has taken a bag of money with him.
PRO.7.20	He will come home at the full moon.”
PRO.7.21	With persuasive words, she led him astray.
PRO.7.21	With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.
PRO.7.22	He followed her immediately,
PRO.7.22	as an ox goes to the slaughter,
PRO.7.22	as a fool stepping into a noose.
PRO.7.23	Until an arrow strikes through his liver,
PRO.7.23	as a bird hurries to the snare,
PRO.7.23	and doesn’t know that it will cost his life.
PRO.7.24	Now therefore, sons, listen to me.
PRO.7.24	Pay attention to the words of my mouth.
PRO.7.25	Don’t let your heart turn to her ways.
PRO.7.25	Don’t go astray in her paths,
PRO.7.26	for she has thrown down many wounded.
PRO.7.26	Yes, all her slain are a mighty army.
PRO.7.27	Her house is the way to Sheol,
PRO.7.27	going down to the rooms of death.
PRO.8.1	Doesn’t wisdom cry out?
PRO.8.1	Doesn’t understanding raise her voice?
PRO.8.2	On the top of high places by the way,
PRO.8.2	where the paths meet, she stands.
PRO.8.3	Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,
PRO.8.3	at the entry doors, she cries aloud:
PRO.8.4	“I call to you men!
PRO.8.4	I send my voice to the sons of mankind.
PRO.8.5	You simple, understand prudence!
PRO.8.5	You fools, be of an understanding heart!
PRO.8.6	Hear, for I will speak excellent things.
PRO.8.6	The opening of my lips is for right things.
PRO.8.7	For my mouth speaks truth.
PRO.8.7	Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
PRO.8.8	All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.
PRO.8.8	There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
PRO.8.9	They are all plain to him who understands,
PRO.8.9	right to those who find knowledge.
PRO.8.10	Receive my instruction rather than silver,
PRO.8.10	knowledge rather than choice gold.
PRO.8.11	For wisdom is better than rubies.
PRO.8.11	All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.
PRO.8.12	“I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.
PRO.8.12	Find out knowledge and discretion.
PRO.8.13	The fear of the 
PRO.8.13	I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.
PRO.8.14	Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.
PRO.8.14	I have understanding and power.
PRO.8.15	By me kings reign,
PRO.8.15	and princes decree justice.
PRO.8.16	By me princes rule,
PRO.8.16	nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth.
PRO.8.17	I love those who love me.
PRO.8.17	Those who seek me diligently will find me.
PRO.8.18	With me are riches, honour,
PRO.8.18	enduring wealth, and prosperity.
PRO.8.19	My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold,
PRO.8.19	my yield than choice silver.
PRO.8.20	I walk in the way of righteousness,
PRO.8.20	in the middle of the paths of justice,
PRO.8.21	that I may give wealth to those who love me.
PRO.8.21	I fill their treasuries.
PRO.8.22	“The 
PRO.8.22	before his deeds of old.
PRO.8.23	I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
PRO.8.23	before the earth existed.
PRO.8.24	When there were no depths, I was born,
PRO.8.24	when there were no springs abounding with water.
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains were settled in place,
PRO.8.25	before the hills, I was born;
PRO.8.26	while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
PRO.8.26	nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
PRO.8.27	When he established the heavens, I was there.
PRO.8.27	When he set a circle on the surface of the deep,
PRO.8.28	when he established the clouds above,
PRO.8.28	when the springs of the deep became strong,
PRO.8.29	when he gave to the sea its boundary,
PRO.8.29	that the waters should not violate his commandment,
PRO.8.29	when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
PRO.8.30	then I was the craftsman by his side.
PRO.8.30	I was a delight day by day,
PRO.8.30	always rejoicing before him,
PRO.8.31	rejoicing in his whole world.
PRO.8.31	My delight was with the sons of men.
PRO.8.32	“Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,
PRO.8.32	for blessed are those who keep my ways.
PRO.8.33	Hear instruction, and be wise.
PRO.8.33	Don’t refuse it.
PRO.8.34	Blessed is the man who hears me,
PRO.8.34	watching daily at my gates,
PRO.8.34	waiting at my door posts.
PRO.8.35	For whoever finds me, finds life,
PRO.8.35	and will obtain favour from the 
PRO.8.36	But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.
PRO.8.36	All those who hate me love death.”
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her house.
PRO.9.1	She has carved out her seven pillars.
PRO.9.2	She has prepared her meat.
PRO.9.2	She has mixed her wine.
PRO.9.2	She has also set her table.
PRO.9.3	She has sent out her maidens.
PRO.9.3	She cries from the highest places of the city:
PRO.9.4	“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
PRO.9.4	As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
PRO.9.5	“Come, eat some of my bread,
PRO.9.5	Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!
PRO.9.6	Leave your simple ways, and live.
PRO.9.6	Walk in the way of understanding.”
PRO.9.7	One who corrects a mocker invites insult.
PRO.9.7	One who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.
PRO.9.8	Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.
PRO.9.8	Reprove a wise person, and he will love you.
PRO.9.9	Instruct a wise person, and he will be still wiser.
PRO.9.9	Teach a righteous person, and he will increase in learning.
PRO.9.10	The fear of the 
PRO.9.10	The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
PRO.9.11	For by me your days will be multiplied.
PRO.9.11	The years of your life will be increased.
PRO.9.12	If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.
PRO.9.12	If you mock, you alone will bear it.
PRO.9.13	The foolish woman is loud,
PRO.9.13	undisciplined, and knows nothing.
PRO.9.14	She sits at the door of her house,
PRO.9.14	on a seat in the high places of the city,
PRO.9.15	to call to those who pass by,
PRO.9.15	who go straight on their ways,
PRO.9.16	“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.”
PRO.9.16	as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
PRO.9.17	“Stolen water is sweet.
PRO.9.17	Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”
PRO.9.18	But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there,
PRO.9.18	that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
PRO.10.1	The proverbs of Solomon.
PRO.10.1	A wise son makes a glad father;
PRO.10.1	but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.
PRO.10.2	Treasures of wickedness profit nothing,
PRO.10.2	but righteousness delivers from death.
PRO.10.3	The 
PRO.10.3	but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.
PRO.10.4	He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand,
PRO.10.4	but the hand of the diligent brings wealth.
PRO.10.5	He who gathers in summer is a wise son,
PRO.10.5	but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame.
PRO.10.6	Blessings are on the head of the righteous,
PRO.10.6	but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.10.7	The memory of the righteous is blessed,
PRO.10.7	but the name of the wicked will rot.
PRO.10.8	The wise in heart accept commandments,
PRO.10.8	but a chattering fool will fall.
PRO.10.9	He who walks blamelessly walks surely,
PRO.10.9	but he who perverts his ways will be found out.
PRO.10.10	One winking with the eye causes sorrow,
PRO.10.10	but a chattering fool will fall.
PRO.10.11	The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life,
PRO.10.11	but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.10.12	Hatred stirs up strife,
PRO.10.12	but love covers all wrongs.
PRO.10.13	Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment,
PRO.10.13	but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.
PRO.10.14	Wise men lay up knowledge,
PRO.10.14	but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin.
PRO.10.15	The rich man’s wealth is his strong city.
PRO.10.15	The destruction of the poor is their poverty.
PRO.10.16	The labour of the righteous leads to life.
PRO.10.16	The increase of the wicked leads to sin.
PRO.10.17	He is in the way of life who heeds correction,
PRO.10.17	but he who forsakes reproof leads others astray.
PRO.10.18	He who hides hatred has lying lips.
PRO.10.18	He who utters a slander is a fool.
PRO.10.19	In the multitude of words there is no lack of disobedience,

PRO.10.20	The heart of the wicked is of little worth.
PRO.10.21	The lips of the righteous feed many,
PRO.10.21	but the foolish die for lack of understanding.

PRO.10.24	but the desire of the righteous will be granted.
PRO.10.25	When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more;
PRO.10.25	but the righteous stand firm forever.
PRO.10.26	As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,
PRO.10.26	so is the sluggard to those who send him.

PRO.11.5	but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
PRO.11.6	The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them,
PRO.11.6	but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires.

PRO.11.7	and expectation of power comes to nothing.
PRO.11.8	A righteous person is delivered out of trouble,
PRO.11.8	and the wicked takes his place.
PRO.11.9	With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbour,
PRO.11.9	but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge.
PRO.11.10	When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices.
PRO.11.10	When the wicked perish, there is shouting.
PRO.11.11	By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted,
PRO.11.11	but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.11.12	One who despises his neighbour is void of wisdom,
PRO.11.12	but a man of understanding holds his peace.
PRO.11.13	One who brings gossip betrays a confidence,
PRO.11.13	but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret.
PRO.11.14	Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls,
PRO.11.14	but in the multitude of counsellors there is victory.
PRO.11.15	He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it,
PRO.11.15	but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure.
PRO.11.16	A gracious woman obtains honour,
PRO.11.16	but violent men obtain riches.
PRO.11.17	The merciful man does good to his own soul,
PRO.11.17	but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.
PRO.11.18	Wicked people earn deceitful wages,
PRO.11.18	but one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.
PRO.11.19	He who is truly righteous gets life.
PRO.11.19	He who pursues evil gets death.
PRO.11.20	Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to the 
PRO.11.20	but those whose ways are blameless are his delight.
PRO.11.21	Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished,
PRO.11.21	but the offspring
PRO.11.22	Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout,
PRO.11.22	is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.
PRO.11.23	The desire of the righteous is only good.
PRO.11.23	The expectation of the wicked is wrath.
PRO.11.24	There is one who scatters, and increases yet more.
PRO.11.24	There is one who withholds more than is appropriate, but gains poverty.
PRO.11.25	The liberal soul shall be made fat.
PRO.11.25	He who waters shall be watered also himself.
PRO.11.26	People curse someone who withholds grain,
PRO.11.26	but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it.
PRO.11.27	He who diligently seeks good seeks favour,
PRO.11.27	but he who searches after evil, it shall come to him.

PRO.12.4	but a disgraceful wife is as rottenness in his bones.
PRO.12.5	The thoughts of the righteous are just,
PRO.12.5	but the advice of the wicked is deceitful.
PRO.12.6	The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood,
PRO.12.6	but the speech of the upright rescues them.
PRO.12.7	The wicked are overthrown, and are no more,
PRO.12.7	but the house of the righteous shall stand.
PRO.12.8	A man shall be commended according to his wisdom,
PRO.12.8	but he who has a warped mind shall be despised.
PRO.12.9	Better is he who is little known, and has a servant,
PRO.12.9	than he who honours himself, and lacks bread.
PRO.12.10	A righteous man respects the life of his animal,
PRO.12.10	but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

PRO.12.14	The work of a man’s hands shall be rewarded to him.
PRO.12.15	The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,
PRO.12.15	but he who is wise listens to counsel.
PRO.12.16	A fool shows his annoyance the same day,
PRO.12.16	but one who overlooks an insult is prudent.
PRO.12.17	He who is truthful testifies honestly,
PRO.12.17	but a false witness lies.
PRO.12.18	There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword,
PRO.12.18	but the tongue of the wise heals.
PRO.12.19	Truth’s lips will be established forever,
PRO.12.19	but a lying tongue is only momentary.

PRO.12.25	but a kind word makes it glad.
PRO.12.26	A righteous person is cautious in friendship,
PRO.12.26	but the way of the wicked leads them astray.
PRO.12.27	The slothful man doesn’t roast his game,
PRO.12.27	but the possessions of diligent men are prized.
PRO.12.28	In the way of righteousness is life;
PRO.12.28	in its path there is no death.
PRO.13.1	A wise son listens to his father’s instruction,
PRO.13.1	but a scoffer doesn’t listen to rebuke.
PRO.13.2	By the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things,
PRO.13.2	but the unfaithful crave violence.
PRO.13.3	He who guards his mouth guards his soul.
PRO.13.3	One who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.
PRO.13.4	The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing,
PRO.13.4	but the desire of the diligent shall be fully satisfied.
PRO.13.5	A righteous man hates lies,
PRO.13.5	but a wicked man brings shame and disgrace.

PRO.13.16	Every prudent man acts from knowledge,
PRO.13.16	but a fool exposes folly.

PRO.14.5	but a false witness pours out lies.
PRO.14.6	A scoffer seeks wisdom, and doesn’t find it,
PRO.14.6	but knowledge comes easily to a discerning person.
PRO.14.7	Stay away from a foolish man,
PRO.14.7	for you won’t find knowledge on his lips.
PRO.14.8	The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way,
PRO.14.8	but the folly of fools is deceit.
PRO.14.9	Fools mock at making atonement for sins,
PRO.14.9	but amongst the upright there is good will.
PRO.14.10	The heart knows its own bitterness and joy;
PRO.14.10	he will not share these with a stranger.
PRO.14.11	The house of the wicked will be overthrown,
PRO.14.11	but the tent of the upright will flourish.
PRO.14.12	There is a way which seems right to a man,
PRO.14.12	but in the end it leads to death.
PRO.14.13	Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful,
PRO.14.13	and mirth may end in heaviness.
PRO.14.14	The unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways;
PRO.14.14	likewise a good man will be rewarded for his ways.
PRO.14.15	A simple man believes everything,
PRO.14.15	but the prudent man carefully considers his ways.
PRO.14.16	A wise man fears and shuns evil,
PRO.14.16	but the fool is hot headed and reckless.
PRO.14.17	He who is quick to become angry will commit folly,
PRO.14.17	and a crafty man is hated.
PRO.14.18	The simple inherit folly,
PRO.14.18	but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
PRO.14.19	The evil bow down before the good,
PRO.14.19	and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
PRO.14.20	The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbour,
PRO.14.20	but the rich person has many friends.
PRO.14.21	He who despises his neighbour sins,
PRO.14.21	but he who has pity on the poor is blessed.
PRO.14.22	Don’t they go astray who plot evil?
PRO.14.22	But love and faithfulness belong to those who plan good.

PRO.14.31	but he who is kind to the needy honours him.
PRO.14.32	The wicked is brought down in his calamity,
PRO.14.32	but in death, the righteous has a refuge.

PRO.14.33	and is even made known in the inward part of fools.

PRO.14.34	but sin is a disgrace to any people.
PRO.14.35	The king’s favour is towards a servant who deals wisely,
PRO.14.35	but his wrath is towards one who causes shame.
PRO.15.1	A gentle answer turns away wrath,
PRO.15.1	but a harsh word stirs up anger.

PRO.15.3	keeping watch on the evil and the good.
PRO.15.4	A gentle tongue is a tree of life,
PRO.15.4	but deceit in it crushes the spirit.
PRO.15.5	A fool despises his father’s correction,
PRO.15.5	but he who heeds reproof shows prudence.
PRO.15.6	In the house of the righteous is much treasure,
PRO.15.6	but the income of the wicked brings trouble.
PRO.15.7	The lips of the wise spread knowledge;
PRO.15.7	not so with the heart of fools.
PRO.15.8	The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to the 
PRO.15.8	but the prayer of the upright is his delight.

PRO.15.9	but he loves him who follows after righteousness.
PRO.15.10	There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way:
PRO.15.10	whoever hates reproof shall die.
PRO.15.11	Sheol
PRO.15.11	how much more then the hearts of the children of men!
PRO.15.12	A scoffer doesn’t love to be reproved;
PRO.15.12	he will not go to the wise.
PRO.15.13	A glad heart makes a cheerful face,
PRO.15.13	but an aching heart breaks the spirit.
PRO.15.14	The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge,
PRO.15.14	but the mouths of fools feed on folly.
PRO.15.15	All the days of the afflicted are wretched,
PRO.15.15	but one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast.
PRO.15.16	Better is little, with the fear of the 
PRO.15.16	than great treasure with trouble.
PRO.15.17	Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is,
PRO.15.17	than a fattened calf with hatred.
PRO.15.18	A wrathful man stirs up contention,
PRO.15.18	but one who is slow to anger appeases strife.
PRO.15.19	The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch,
PRO.15.19	but the path of the upright is a highway.
PRO.15.20	A wise son makes a father glad,
PRO.15.20	but a foolish man despises his mother.
PRO.15.21	Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom,
PRO.15.21	but a man of understanding keeps his way straight.
PRO.15.22	Where there is no counsel, plans fail;
PRO.15.22	but in a multitude of counsellors they are established.
PRO.15.23	Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth.
PRO.15.23	How good is a word at the right time!
PRO.15.24	The path of life leads upward for the wise,
PRO.15.24	to keep him from going downward to Sheol.

PRO.15.30	Good news gives health to the bones.
PRO.15.31	The ear that listens to reproof lives,
PRO.15.31	and will be at home amongst the wise.
PRO.15.32	He who refuses correction despises his own soul,
PRO.15.32	but he who listens to reproof gets understanding.
PRO.15.33	The fear of the 
PRO.15.33	Before honour is humility.
PRO.16.1	The plans of the heart belong to man,
PRO.16.1	but the answer of the tongue is from the 
PRO.16.2	All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes;
PRO.16.2	but the 
PRO.16.3	Commit your deeds to the 
PRO.16.3	and your plans shall succeed.
PRO.16.4	The 
PRO.16.4	yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.
PRO.16.5	Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the

PRO.16.6	By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for.
PRO.16.6	By the fear of the 
PRO.16.7	When a man’s ways please the 
PRO.16.7	he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
PRO.16.8	Better is a little with righteousness,
PRO.16.8	than great revenues with injustice.
PRO.16.9	A man’s heart plans his course,
PRO.16.9	but the 
PRO.16.10	Inspired judgements are on the lips of the king.
PRO.16.10	He shall not betray his mouth.
PRO.16.11	Honest balances and scales are the 
PRO.16.11	all the weights in the bag are his work.
PRO.16.12	It is an abomination for kings to do wrong,
PRO.16.12	for the throne is established by righteousness.
PRO.16.13	Righteous lips are the delight of kings.
PRO.16.13	They value one who speaks the truth.
PRO.16.14	The king’s wrath is a messenger of death,
PRO.16.14	but a wise man will pacify it.
PRO.16.15	In the light of the king’s face is life.
PRO.16.15	His favour is like a cloud of the spring rain.
PRO.16.16	How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!
PRO.16.16	Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.
PRO.16.17	The highway of the upright is to depart from evil.
PRO.16.17	He who keeps his way preserves his soul.
PRO.16.18	Pride goes before destruction,
PRO.16.18	and an arrogant spirit before a fall.
PRO.16.19	It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor,
PRO.16.19	than to divide the plunder with the proud.
PRO.16.20	He who heeds the Word finds prosperity.
PRO.16.20	Whoever trusts in the 
PRO.16.21	The wise in heart shall be called prudent.
PRO.16.21	Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction.
PRO.16.22	Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,
PRO.16.22	but the punishment of fools is their folly.
PRO.16.23	The heart of the wise instructs his mouth,
PRO.16.23	and adds learning to his lips.
PRO.16.24	Pleasant words are a honeycomb,
PRO.16.24	sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
PRO.16.25	There is a way which seems right to a man,
PRO.16.25	but in the end it leads to death.
PRO.16.26	The appetite of the labouring man labours for him;
PRO.16.26	for his mouth urges him on.
PRO.16.27	A worthless man devises mischief.
PRO.16.27	His speech is like a scorching fire.
PRO.16.28	A perverse man stirs up strife.
PRO.16.28	A whisperer separates close friends.
PRO.16.29	A man of violence entices his neighbour,
PRO.16.29	and leads him in a way that is not good.
PRO.16.30	One who winks his eyes to plot perversities,
PRO.16.30	one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil.
PRO.16.31	Grey hair is a crown of glory.
PRO.16.31	It is attained by a life of righteousness.
PRO.16.32	One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty;
PRO.16.32	one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.
PRO.16.33	The lot is cast into the lap,
PRO.16.33	but its every decision is from the 
PRO.17.1	Better is a dry morsel with quietness,
PRO.17.1	than a house full of feasting with strife.
PRO.17.2	A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame,
PRO.17.2	and shall have a part in the inheritance amongst the brothers.
PRO.17.3	The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,
PRO.17.3	but the

PRO.17.5	Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker.
PRO.17.5	He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.
PRO.17.6	Children’s children are the crown of old men;
PRO.17.6	the glory of children are their parents.
PRO.17.7	Excellent speech isn’t fitting for a fool,
PRO.17.7	much less do lying lips fit a prince.
PRO.17.8	A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it;
PRO.17.8	wherever he turns, he prospers.
PRO.17.9	He who covers an offence promotes love;
PRO.17.9	but he who repeats a matter separates best friends.
PRO.17.10	A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding
PRO.17.10	than a hundred lashes into a fool.
PRO.17.11	An evil man seeks only rebellion;
PRO.17.11	therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
PRO.17.12	Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man,
PRO.17.12	rather than a fool in his folly.
PRO.17.13	Whoever rewards evil for good,
PRO.17.13	evil shall not depart from his house.
PRO.17.14	The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam,
PRO.17.14	therefore stop contention before quarrelling breaks out.
PRO.17.15	He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous,
PRO.17.15	both of them alike are an abomination to the 
PRO.17.16	Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,
PRO.17.16	since he has no understanding?
PRO.17.17	A friend loves at all times;
PRO.17.17	and a brother is born for adversity.
PRO.17.18	A man void of understanding strikes hands,
PRO.17.18	and becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbour.
PRO.17.19	He who loves disobedience loves strife.
PRO.17.19	One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.
PRO.17.20	One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity,
PRO.17.20	and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.
PRO.17.21	He who becomes the father of a fool grieves.
PRO.17.21	The father of a fool has no joy.
PRO.17.22	A cheerful heart makes good medicine,
PRO.17.22	but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
PRO.17.23	A wicked man receives a bribe in secret,
PRO.17.23	to pervert the ways of justice.
PRO.17.24	Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding,
PRO.17.24	but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.
PRO.17.25	A foolish son brings grief to his father,
PRO.17.25	and bitterness to her who bore him.
PRO.17.26	Also to punish the righteous is not good,
PRO.17.26	nor to flog officials for their integrity.
PRO.17.27	He who spares his words has knowledge.
PRO.17.27	He who is even tempered is a man of understanding.
PRO.17.28	Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise.
PRO.17.28	When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.
PRO.18.1	A man who isolates himself pursues selfishness,
PRO.18.1	and defies all sound judgement.
PRO.18.2	A fool has no delight in understanding,
PRO.18.2	but only in revealing his own opinion.
PRO.18.3	When wickedness comes, contempt also comes,
PRO.18.3	and with shame comes disgrace.
PRO.18.4	The words of a man’s mouth are like deep waters.
PRO.18.4	The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.
PRO.18.5	To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good,
PRO.18.5	nor to deprive the innocent of justice.
PRO.18.6	A fool’s lips come into strife,
PRO.18.6	and his mouth invites beatings.
PRO.18.7	A fool’s mouth is his destruction,
PRO.18.7	and his lips are a snare to his soul.
PRO.18.8	The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels:
PRO.18.8	they go down into a person’s innermost parts.
PRO.18.9	One who is slack in his work
PRO.18.9	is brother to him who is a master of destruction.
PRO.18.10	The 
PRO.18.10	the righteous run to him, and are safe.
PRO.18.11	The rich man’s wealth is his strong city,
PRO.18.11	like an unscalable wall in his own imagination.
PRO.18.12	Before destruction the heart of man is proud,
PRO.18.12	but before honour is humility.
PRO.18.13	He who answers before he hears,
PRO.18.13	that is folly and shame to him.
PRO.18.14	A man’s spirit will sustain him in sickness,
PRO.18.14	but a crushed spirit, who can bear?
PRO.18.15	The heart of the discerning gets knowledge.
PRO.18.15	The ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
PRO.18.16	A man’s gift makes room for him,
PRO.18.16	and brings him before great men.
PRO.18.17	He who pleads his cause first seems right;
PRO.18.17	until another comes and questions him.
PRO.18.18	The lot settles disputes,
PRO.18.18	and keeps strong ones apart.
PRO.18.19	A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city.
PRO.18.19	Disputes are like the bars of a fortress.
PRO.18.20	A man’s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth.
PRO.18.20	With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.
PRO.18.21	Death and life are in the power of the tongue;
PRO.18.21	those who love it will eat its fruit.
PRO.18.22	Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing,
PRO.18.22	and obtains favour of the 
PRO.18.23	The poor plead for mercy,
PRO.18.23	but the rich answer harshly.
PRO.18.24	A man of many companions may be ruined,
PRO.18.24	but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
PRO.19.1	Better is the poor who walks in his integrity
PRO.19.1	than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.
PRO.19.2	It isn’t good to have zeal without knowledge,
PRO.19.2	nor being hasty with one’s feet and missing the way.
PRO.19.3	The foolishness of man subverts his way;
PRO.19.3	his heart rages against the 
PRO.19.4	Wealth adds many friends,
PRO.19.4	but the poor is separated from his friend.
PRO.19.5	A false witness shall not be unpunished.
PRO.19.5	He who pours out lies shall not go free.
PRO.19.6	Many will entreat the favour of a ruler,
PRO.19.6	and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.
PRO.19.7	All the relatives of the poor shun him:
PRO.19.7	how much more do his friends avoid him!
PRO.19.7	He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.
PRO.19.8	He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.
PRO.19.8	He who keeps understanding shall find good.
PRO.19.9	A false witness shall not be unpunished.
PRO.19.9	He who utters lies shall perish.
PRO.19.10	Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool,
PRO.19.10	much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
PRO.19.11	The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger.
PRO.19.11	It is his glory to overlook an offence.
PRO.19.12	The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion,
PRO.19.12	but his favour is like dew on the grass.
PRO.19.13	A foolish son is the calamity of his father.
PRO.19.13	A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping.
PRO.19.14	House and riches are an inheritance from fathers,
PRO.19.14	but a prudent wife is from the 
PRO.19.15	Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep.
PRO.19.15	The idle soul shall suffer hunger.
PRO.19.16	He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul,
PRO.19.16	but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die.
PRO.19.17	He who has pity on the poor lends to the 
PRO.19.17	he will reward him.
PRO.19.18	Discipline your son, for there is hope;
PRO.19.18	don’t be a willing party to his death.
PRO.19.19	A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty,
PRO.19.19	for if you rescue him, you must do it again.
PRO.19.20	Listen to counsel and receive instruction,
PRO.19.20	that you may be wise in your latter end.
PRO.19.21	There are many plans in a man’s heart,
PRO.19.21	but the 
PRO.19.22	That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.
PRO.19.22	A poor man is better than a liar.
PRO.19.23	The fear of the 
PRO.19.23	he rests and will not be touched by trouble.
PRO.19.24	The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
PRO.19.24	he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
PRO.19.25	Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;
PRO.19.25	rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.
PRO.19.26	He who robs his father and drives away his mother
PRO.19.26	is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.
PRO.19.27	If you stop listening to instruction, my son,
PRO.19.27	you will stray from the words of knowledge.
PRO.19.28	A corrupt witness mocks justice,
PRO.19.28	and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity.
PRO.19.29	Penalties are prepared for scoffers,
PRO.19.29	and beatings for the backs of fools.
PRO.20.1	Wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler.
PRO.20.1	Whoever is led astray by them is not wise.
PRO.20.2	The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion.
PRO.20.2	He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.
PRO.20.3	It is an honour for a man to keep aloof from strife,
PRO.20.3	but every fool will be quarrelling.
PRO.20.4	The sluggard will not plough by reason of the winter;
PRO.20.4	therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.
PRO.20.5	Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water,
PRO.20.5	but a man of understanding will draw it out.
PRO.20.6	Many men claim to be men of unfailing love,
PRO.20.6	but who can find a faithful man?
PRO.20.7	A righteous man walks in integrity.
PRO.20.7	Blessed are his children after him.
PRO.20.8	A king who sits on the throne of judgement
PRO.20.8	scatters away all evil with his eyes.
PRO.20.9	Who can say, “I have made my heart pure.
PRO.20.9	I am clean and without sin?”
PRO.20.10	Differing weights and differing measures,
PRO.20.10	both of them alike are an abomination to the 
PRO.20.11	Even a child makes himself known by his doings,
PRO.20.11	whether his work is pure, and whether it is right.
PRO.20.12	The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,
PRO.20.12	The 
PRO.20.13	Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty.
PRO.20.13	Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.
PRO.20.14	“It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer;
PRO.20.14	but when he is gone his way, then he boasts.
PRO.20.15	There is gold and abundance of rubies,
PRO.20.15	but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel.
PRO.20.16	Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger;
PRO.20.16	and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.
PRO.20.17	Fraudulent food is sweet to a man,
PRO.20.17	but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel.
PRO.20.18	Plans are established by advice;
PRO.20.18	by wise guidance you wage war!
PRO.20.19	He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets;
PRO.20.19	therefore don’t keep company with him who opens wide his lips.
PRO.20.20	Whoever curses his father or his mother,
PRO.20.20	his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.
PRO.20.21	An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning,
PRO.20.21	won’t be blessed in the end.
PRO.20.22	Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.”
PRO.20.22	Wait for the 
PRO.20.23	The 
PRO.20.23	and dishonest scales are not pleasing.
PRO.20.24	A man’s steps are from the 
PRO.20.24	how then can man understand his way?
PRO.20.25	It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication,
PRO.20.25	then later to consider his vows.
PRO.20.26	A wise king winnows out the wicked,
PRO.20.26	and drives the threshing wheel over them.
PRO.20.27	The spirit of man is the 
PRO.20.27	searching all his innermost parts.
PRO.20.28	Love and faithfulness keep the king safe.
PRO.20.28	His throne is sustained by love.
PRO.20.29	The glory of young men is their strength.
PRO.20.29	The splendour of old men is their grey hair.
PRO.20.30	Wounding blows cleanse away evil,
PRO.20.30	and beatings purge the innermost parts.
PRO.21.1	The king’s heart is in the 
PRO.21.1	He turns it wherever he desires.
PRO.21.2	Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,
PRO.21.2	but the 
PRO.21.3	To do righteousness and justice
PRO.21.3	is more acceptable to the 
PRO.21.4	A high look and a proud heart,
PRO.21.4	the lamp of the wicked, is sin.
PRO.21.5	The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit;
PRO.21.5	and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.
PRO.21.6	Getting treasures by a lying tongue
PRO.21.6	is a fleeting vapour for those who seek death.
PRO.21.7	The violence of the wicked will drive them away,
PRO.21.7	because they refuse to do what is right.
PRO.21.8	The way of the guilty is devious,
PRO.21.8	but the conduct of the innocent is upright.
PRO.21.9	It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop
PRO.21.9	than to share a house with a contentious woman.
PRO.21.10	The soul of the wicked desires evil;
PRO.21.10	his neighbour finds no mercy in his eyes.
PRO.21.11	When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom.
PRO.21.11	When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
PRO.21.12	The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked,
PRO.21.12	and brings the wicked to ruin.
PRO.21.13	Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor,
PRO.21.13	he will also cry out, but shall not be heard.
PRO.21.14	A gift in secret pacifies anger,
PRO.21.14	and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.
PRO.21.15	It is joy to the righteous to do justice;
PRO.21.15	but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
PRO.21.16	The man who wanders out of the way of understanding
PRO.21.16	shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits.
PRO.21.17	He who loves pleasure will be a poor man.
PRO.21.17	He who loves wine and oil won’t be rich.
PRO.21.18	The wicked is a ransom for the righteous,
PRO.21.18	the treacherous for the upright.
PRO.21.19	It is better to dwell in a desert land,
PRO.21.19	than with a contentious and fretful woman.
PRO.21.20	There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
PRO.21.20	but a foolish man swallows it up.
PRO.21.21	He who follows after righteousness and kindness
PRO.21.21	finds life, righteousness, and honour.
PRO.21.22	A wise man scales the city of the mighty,
PRO.21.22	and brings down the strength of its confidence.
PRO.21.23	Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue
PRO.21.23	keeps his soul from troubles.
PRO.21.24	The proud and arrogant man—“Scoffer” is his name—
PRO.21.24	he works in the arrogance of pride.
PRO.21.25	The desire of the sluggard kills him,
PRO.21.25	for his hands refuse to labour.
PRO.21.26	There are those who covet greedily all day long;
PRO.21.26	but the righteous give and don’t withhold.
PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination—
PRO.21.27	how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!
PRO.21.28	A false witness will perish.
PRO.21.28	A man who listens speaks to eternity.
PRO.21.29	A wicked man hardens his face;
PRO.21.29	but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.
PRO.21.30	There is no wisdom nor understanding
PRO.21.30	nor counsel against the 
PRO.21.31	The horse is prepared for the day of battle;
PRO.21.31	but victory is with the 
PRO.22.1	A good name is more desirable than great riches,
PRO.22.1	and loving favour is better than silver and gold.
PRO.22.2	The rich and the poor have this in common:
PRO.22.2	The 
PRO.22.3	A prudent man sees danger and hides himself;
PRO.22.3	but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
PRO.22.4	The result of humility and the fear of the 
PRO.22.4	is wealth, honour, and life.
PRO.22.5	Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked:
PRO.22.5	whoever guards his soul stays from them.
PRO.22.6	Train up a child in the way he should go,
PRO.22.6	and when he is old he will not depart from it.
PRO.22.7	The rich rule over the poor.
PRO.22.7	The borrower is servant to the lender.
PRO.22.8	He who sows wickedness reaps trouble,
PRO.22.8	and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.
PRO.22.9	He who has a generous eye will be blessed;
PRO.22.9	for he shares his food with the poor.
PRO.22.10	Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out;
PRO.22.10	yes, quarrels and insults will stop.
PRO.22.11	He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully
PRO.22.11	is the king’s friend.
PRO.22.12	The 
PRO.22.12	but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.
PRO.22.13	The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!
PRO.22.13	I will be killed in the streets!”
PRO.22.14	The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit.
PRO.22.14	He who is under the 
PRO.22.15	Folly is bound up in the heart of a child:
PRO.22.15	the rod of discipline drives it far from him.
PRO.22.16	Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich,
PRO.22.16	both come to poverty.
PRO.22.17	Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise.
PRO.22.17	Apply your heart to my teaching.
PRO.22.18	For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,
PRO.22.18	if all of them are ready on your lips.
PRO.22.19	I teach you today, even you,
PRO.22.19	So that your trust may be in the 
PRO.22.20	Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things
PRO.22.20	of counsel and knowledge,
PRO.22.21	To teach you truth, reliable words,
PRO.22.21	to give sound answers to the ones who sent you?
PRO.22.22	Don’t exploit the poor, because he is poor;
PRO.22.22	and don’t crush the needy in court;
PRO.22.23	for the 
PRO.22.23	and plunder the life of those who plunder them.
PRO.22.24	Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man,
PRO.22.24	and don’t associate with one who harbours anger:
PRO.22.25	lest you learn his ways,
PRO.22.25	and ensnare your soul.
PRO.22.26	Don’t you be one of those who strike hands,
PRO.22.26	of those who are collateral for debts.
PRO.22.27	If you don’t have means to pay,
PRO.22.27	why should he take away your bed from under you?
PRO.22.28	Don’t move the ancient boundary stone
PRO.22.28	which your fathers have set up.
PRO.22.29	Do you see a man skilled in his work?
PRO.22.29	He will serve kings.
PRO.22.29	He won’t serve obscure men.
PRO.23.1	When you sit to eat with a ruler,
PRO.23.1	consider diligently what is before you;
PRO.23.2	put a knife to your throat,
PRO.23.2	if you are a man given to appetite.
PRO.23.3	Don’t be desirous of his dainties,
PRO.23.3	since they are deceitful food.
PRO.23.4	Don’t weary yourself to be rich.
PRO.23.4	In your wisdom, show restraint.
PRO.23.5	Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?
PRO.23.5	For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.
PRO.23.6	Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye,
PRO.23.6	and don’t crave his delicacies:
PRO.23.7	for as he thinks about the cost, so he is.
PRO.23.7	“Eat and drink!” he says to you,
PRO.23.7	but his heart is not with you.
PRO.23.8	The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up,
PRO.23.8	and lose your good words.
PRO.23.9	Don’t speak in the ears of a fool,
PRO.23.9	for he will despise the wisdom of your words.
PRO.23.10	Don’t move the ancient boundary stone.
PRO.23.10	Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless,
PRO.23.11	for their Defender is strong.
PRO.23.11	He will plead their case against you.
PRO.23.12	Apply your heart to instruction,
PRO.23.12	and your ears to the words of knowledge.
PRO.23.13	Don’t withhold correction from a child.
PRO.23.13	If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.
PRO.23.14	Punish him with the rod,
PRO.23.14	and save his soul from Sheol.
PRO.23.15	My son, if your heart is wise,
PRO.23.15	then my heart will be glad, even mine.
PRO.23.16	Yes, my heart will rejoice
PRO.23.16	when your lips speak what is right.
PRO.23.17	Don’t let your heart envy sinners,
PRO.23.17	but rather fear the 
PRO.23.18	Indeed surely there is a future hope,
PRO.23.18	and your hope will not be cut off.
PRO.23.19	Listen, my son, and be wise,
PRO.23.19	and keep your heart on the right path!
PRO.23.20	Don’t be amongst ones drinking too much wine,
PRO.23.20	or those who gorge themselves on meat:
PRO.23.21	for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor;
PRO.23.21	and drowsiness clothes them in rags.
PRO.23.22	Listen to your father who gave you life,
PRO.23.22	and don’t despise your mother when she is old.
PRO.23.23	Buy the truth, and don’t sell it.
PRO.23.23	Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.
PRO.23.24	The father of the righteous has great joy.
PRO.23.24	Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.
PRO.23.25	Let your father and your mother be glad!
PRO.23.25	Let her who bore you rejoice!
PRO.23.26	My son, give me your heart;
PRO.23.26	and let your eyes keep in my ways.
PRO.23.27	For a prostitute is a deep pit;
PRO.23.27	and a wayward wife is a narrow well.
PRO.23.28	Yes, she lies in wait like a robber,
PRO.23.28	and increases the unfaithful amongst men.
PRO.23.29	Who has woe?
PRO.23.29	Who has sorrow?
PRO.23.29	Who has strife?
PRO.23.29	Who has complaints?
PRO.23.29	Who has needless bruises?
PRO.23.29	Who has bloodshot eyes?
PRO.23.30	Those who stay long at the wine;
PRO.23.30	those who go to seek out mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Don’t look at the wine when it is red,
PRO.23.31	when it sparkles in the cup,
PRO.23.31	when it goes down smoothly.
PRO.23.32	In the end, it bites like a snake,
PRO.23.32	and poisons like a viper.
PRO.23.33	Your eyes will see strange things,
PRO.23.33	and your mind will imagine confusing things.
PRO.23.34	Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the middle of the sea,
PRO.23.34	or as he who lies on top of the rigging:
PRO.23.35	“They hit me, and I was not hurt!
PRO.23.35	They beat me, and I don’t feel it!
PRO.23.35	When will I wake up? I can do it again.
PRO.23.35	I can find another.”
PRO.24.1	Don’t be envious of evil men,
PRO.24.1	neither desire to be with them;
PRO.24.2	for their hearts plot violence
PRO.24.2	and their lips talk about mischief.
PRO.24.3	Through wisdom a house is built;
PRO.24.3	by understanding it is established;
PRO.24.4	by knowledge the rooms are filled
PRO.24.4	with all rare and beautiful treasure.
PRO.24.5	A wise man has great power;
PRO.24.5	and a knowledgeable man increases strength;
PRO.24.6	for by wise guidance you wage your war;
PRO.24.6	and victory is in many advisors.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is too high for a fool.
PRO.24.7	He doesn’t open his mouth in the gate.
PRO.24.8	One who plots to do evil
PRO.24.8	will be called a schemer.
PRO.24.9	The schemes of folly are sin.
PRO.24.9	The mocker is detested by men.
PRO.24.10	If you falter in the time of trouble,
PRO.24.10	your strength is small.
PRO.24.11	Rescue those who are being led away to death!
PRO.24.11	Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!
PRO.24.12	If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this,”
PRO.24.12	doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it?
PRO.24.12	He who keeps your soul, doesn’t he know it?
PRO.24.12	Shall he not render to every man according to his work?
PRO.24.13	My son, eat honey, for it is good,
PRO.24.13	the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste;
PRO.24.14	so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul.
PRO.24.14	If you have found it, then there will be a reward:
PRO.24.14	Your hope will not be cut off.
PRO.24.15	Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous.
PRO.24.15	Don’t destroy his resting place;
PRO.24.16	for a righteous man falls seven times and rises up again;
PRO.24.16	but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
PRO.24.17	Don’t rejoice when your enemy falls.
PRO.24.17	Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown,
PRO.24.18	lest the 
PRO.24.18	and he turn away his wrath from him.
PRO.24.19	Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers,
PRO.24.19	neither be envious of the wicked;
PRO.24.20	for there will be no reward to the evil man.
PRO.24.20	The lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.
PRO.24.21	My son, fear the 
PRO.24.21	Don’t join those who are rebellious;
PRO.24.22	for their calamity will rise suddenly.
PRO.24.22	Who knows what destruction may come from them both?
PRO.24.23	These also are sayings of the wise.
PRO.24.23	To show partiality in judgement is not good.
PRO.24.24	He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”
PRO.24.24	peoples will curse him, and nations will abhor him—
PRO.24.25	but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,
PRO.24.25	and a rich blessing will come on them.
PRO.24.26	An honest answer
PRO.24.26	is like a kiss on the lips.
PRO.24.27	Prepare your work outside,
PRO.24.27	and get your fields ready.
PRO.24.27	Afterwards, build your house.
PRO.24.28	Don’t be a witness against your neighbour without cause.
PRO.24.28	Don’t deceive with your lips.
PRO.24.29	Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;
PRO.24.29	I will repay the man according to his work.”
PRO.24.30	I went by the field of the sluggard,
PRO.24.30	by the vineyard of the man void of understanding:
PRO.24.31	Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.
PRO.24.31	Its surface was covered with nettles,
PRO.24.31	and its stone wall was broken down.
PRO.24.32	Then I saw, and considered well.
PRO.24.32	I saw, and received instruction:
PRO.24.33	a little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.24.33	a little folding of the hands to sleep,
PRO.24.34	so your poverty will come as a robber
PRO.24.34	and your want as an armed man.
PRO.25.1	These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
PRO.25.2	It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,
PRO.25.2	but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.
PRO.25.3	As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,
PRO.25.3	so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
PRO.25.4	Take away the dross from the silver,
PRO.25.4	and material comes out for the refiner;
PRO.25.5	Take away the wicked from the king’s presence,
PRO.25.5	and his throne will be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king,
PRO.25.6	or claim a place amongst great men;
PRO.25.7	for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”
PRO.25.7	than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,
PRO.25.7	whom your eyes have seen.
PRO.25.8	Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court.
PRO.25.8	What will you do in the end when your neighbour shames you?
PRO.25.9	Debate your case with your neighbour,
PRO.25.9	and don’t betray the confidence of another,
PRO.25.10	lest one who hears it put you to shame,
PRO.25.10	and your bad reputation never depart.
PRO.25.11	A word fitly spoken
PRO.25.11	is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
PRO.25.12	As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
PRO.25.12	so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.
PRO.25.13	As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
PRO.25.13	so is a faithful messenger to those who send him;
PRO.25.13	for he refreshes the soul of his masters.
PRO.25.14	As clouds and wind without rain,
PRO.25.14	so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively.
PRO.25.15	By patience a ruler is persuaded.
PRO.25.15	A soft tongue breaks the bone.
PRO.25.16	Have you found honey?
PRO.25.16	Eat as much as is sufficient for you,
PRO.25.16	lest you eat too much, and vomit it.
PRO.25.17	Let your foot be seldom in your neighbour’s house,
PRO.25.17	lest he be weary of you, and hate you.
PRO.25.18	A man who gives false testimony against his neighbour
PRO.25.18	is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.
PRO.25.19	Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble
PRO.25.19	is like a bad tooth or a lame foot.
PRO.25.20	As one who takes away a garment in cold weather,
PRO.25.20	or vinegar on soda,
PRO.25.20	so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
PRO.25.21	If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.
PRO.25.21	If he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
PRO.25.22	for you will heap coals of fire on his head,
PRO.25.22	and the 
PRO.25.23	The north wind produces rain;
PRO.25.23	so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.
PRO.25.24	It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop
PRO.25.24	than to share a house with a contentious woman.
PRO.25.25	Like cold water to a thirsty soul,
PRO.25.25	so is good news from a far country.
PRO.25.26	Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,
PRO.25.26	so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat much honey,
PRO.25.27	nor is it honourable to seek one’s own honour.
PRO.25.28	Like a city that is broken down and without walls
PRO.25.28	is a man whose spirit is without restraint.
PRO.26.1	Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
PRO.26.1	so honour is not fitting for a fool.
PRO.26.2	Like a fluttering sparrow,
PRO.26.2	like a darting swallow,
PRO.26.2	so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest.
PRO.26.3	A whip is for the horse,
PRO.26.3	a bridle for the donkey,
PRO.26.3	and a rod for the back of fools!
PRO.26.4	Don’t answer a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.4	lest you also be like him.
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool according to his folly,
PRO.26.5	lest he be wise in his own eyes.
PRO.26.6	One who sends a message by the hand of a fool
PRO.26.6	is cutting off feet and drinking violence.
PRO.26.7	Like the legs of the lame that hang loose,
PRO.26.7	so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
PRO.26.8	As one who binds a stone in a sling,
PRO.26.8	so is he who gives honour to a fool.
PRO.26.9	Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,
PRO.26.9	so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
PRO.26.10	As an archer who wounds all,
PRO.26.10	so is he who hires a fool
PRO.26.10	or he who hires those who pass by.
PRO.26.11	As a dog that returns to his vomit,
PRO.26.11	so is a fool who repeats his folly.
PRO.26.12	Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.26.13	The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!
PRO.26.13	A fierce lion roams the streets!”
PRO.26.14	As the door turns on its hinges,
PRO.26.14	so does the sluggard on his bed.
PRO.26.15	The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.
PRO.26.15	He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
PRO.26.16	The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
PRO.26.16	than seven men who answer with discretion.
PRO.26.17	Like one who grabs a dog’s ears
PRO.26.17	is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.
PRO.26.18	Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death,
PRO.26.19	is the man who deceives his neighbour and says, “Am I not joking?”
PRO.26.20	For lack of wood a fire goes out.
PRO.26.20	Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.
PRO.26.21	As coals are to hot embers,
PRO.26.21	and wood to fire,
PRO.26.21	so is a contentious man to kindling strife.
PRO.26.22	The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
PRO.26.22	they go down into the innermost parts.
PRO.26.23	Like silver dross on an earthen vessel
PRO.26.23	are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.
PRO.26.24	A malicious man disguises himself with his lips,
PRO.26.24	but he harbours evil in his heart.
PRO.26.25	When his speech is charming, don’t believe him,
PRO.26.25	for there are seven abominations in his heart.
PRO.26.26	His malice may be concealed by deception,
PRO.26.26	but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
PRO.26.27	Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.
PRO.26.27	Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hates those it hurts;
PRO.26.28	and a flattering mouth works ruin.
PRO.27.1	Don’t boast about tomorrow;
PRO.27.1	for you don’t know what a day may bring.
PRO.27.2	Let another man praise you,
PRO.27.2	and not your own mouth;
PRO.27.2	a stranger, and not your own lips.
PRO.27.3	A stone is heavy,
PRO.27.3	and sand is a burden;
PRO.27.3	but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.
PRO.27.4	Wrath is cruel,
PRO.27.4	and anger is overwhelming;
PRO.27.4	but who is able to stand before jealousy?
PRO.27.5	Better is open rebuke
PRO.27.5	than hidden love.
PRO.27.6	The wounds of a friend are faithful,
PRO.27.6	although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
PRO.27.7	A full soul loathes a honeycomb;
PRO.27.7	but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet.
PRO.27.8	As a bird that wanders from her nest,
PRO.27.8	so is a man who wanders from his home.
PRO.27.9	Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart;
PRO.27.9	so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend.
PRO.27.10	Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend.
PRO.27.10	Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster.
PRO.27.10	A neighbour who is near is better than a distant brother.
PRO.27.11	Be wise, my son,
PRO.27.11	and bring joy to my heart,
PRO.27.11	then I can answer my tormentor.
PRO.27.12	A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge;
PRO.27.12	but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
PRO.27.13	Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger.
PRO.27.13	Hold it for a wayward woman!
PRO.27.14	He who blesses his neighbour with a loud voice early in the morning,
PRO.27.14	it will be taken as a curse by him.
PRO.27.15	A continual dropping on a rainy day
PRO.27.15	and a contentious wife are alike:
PRO.27.16	restraining her is like restraining the wind,
PRO.27.16	or like grasping oil in his right hand.
PRO.27.17	Iron sharpens iron;
PRO.27.17	so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance.
PRO.27.18	Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit.
PRO.27.18	He who looks after his master shall be honoured.
PRO.27.19	Like water reflects a face,
PRO.27.19	so a man’s heart reflects the man.
PRO.27.20	Sheol
PRO.27.20	and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.
PRO.27.21	The crucible is for silver,
PRO.27.21	and the furnace for gold;
PRO.27.21	but man is refined by his praise.
PRO.27.22	Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,
PRO.27.22	yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.
PRO.27.23	Know well the state of your flocks,
PRO.27.23	and pay attention to your herds:
PRO.27.24	for riches are not forever,
PRO.27.24	nor does the crown endure to all generations.
PRO.27.25	The hay is removed, and the new growth appears,
PRO.27.25	the grasses of the hills are gathered in.
PRO.27.26	The lambs are for your clothing,
PRO.27.26	and the goats are the price of a field.
PRO.27.27	There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food,
PRO.27.27	for your family’s food,
PRO.27.27	and for the nourishment of your servant girls.
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no one pursues;
PRO.28.1	but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
PRO.28.2	In rebellion, a land has many rulers,
PRO.28.2	but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.
PRO.28.3	A needy man who oppresses the poor
PRO.28.3	is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.
PRO.28.4	Those who forsake the law praise the wicked;
PRO.28.4	but those who keep the law contend with them.
PRO.28.5	Evil men don’t understand justice;
PRO.28.5	but those who seek the 
PRO.28.6	Better is the poor who walks in his integrity,
PRO.28.6	than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.
PRO.28.7	Whoever keeps the law is a wise son;
PRO.28.7	but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.
PRO.28.8	He who increases his wealth by excessive interest
PRO.28.8	gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.
PRO.28.9	He who turns away his ear from hearing the law,
PRO.28.9	even his prayer is an abomination.
PRO.28.10	Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way,
PRO.28.10	he will fall into his own trap;
PRO.28.10	but the blameless will inherit good.
PRO.28.11	The rich man is wise in his own eyes;
PRO.28.11	but the poor who has understanding sees through him.
PRO.28.12	When the righteous triumph, there is great glory;
PRO.28.12	but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
PRO.28.13	He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper,
PRO.28.13	but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.
PRO.28.14	Blessed is the man who always fears;
PRO.28.14	but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.
PRO.28.15	As a roaring lion or a charging bear,
PRO.28.15	so is a wicked ruler over helpless people.
PRO.28.16	A tyrannical ruler lacks judgement.
PRO.28.16	One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.
PRO.28.17	A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death;
PRO.28.17	no one will support him.
PRO.28.18	Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe;
PRO.28.18	but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.
PRO.28.19	One who works his land will have an abundance of food;
PRO.28.19	but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
PRO.28.20	A faithful man is rich with blessings;
PRO.28.20	but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.
PRO.28.21	To show partiality is not good;
PRO.28.21	yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.
PRO.28.22	A stingy man hurries after riches,
PRO.28.22	and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him.
PRO.28.23	One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favour
PRO.28.23	than one who flatters with the tongue.
PRO.28.24	Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “It’s not wrong,”
PRO.28.24	is a partner with a destroyer.
PRO.28.25	One who is greedy stirs up strife;
PRO.28.25	but one who trusts in the 
PRO.28.26	One who trusts in himself is a fool;
PRO.28.26	but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe.
PRO.28.27	One who gives to the poor has no lack;
PRO.28.27	but one who closes his eyes will have many curses.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;
PRO.28.28	but when they perish, the righteous thrive.
PRO.29.1	He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck
PRO.29.1	will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.
PRO.29.2	When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice;
PRO.29.2	but when the wicked rule, the people groan.
PRO.29.3	Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father;
PRO.29.3	but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.
PRO.29.4	The king by justice makes the land stable,
PRO.29.4	but he who takes bribes tears it down.
PRO.29.5	A man who flatters his neighbour
PRO.29.5	spreads a net for his feet.
PRO.29.6	An evil man is snared by his sin,
PRO.29.6	but the righteous can sing and be glad.
PRO.29.7	The righteous care about justice for the poor.
PRO.29.7	The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge.
PRO.29.8	Mockers stir up a city,
PRO.29.8	but wise men turn away anger.
PRO.29.9	If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man,
PRO.29.9	the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace.
PRO.29.10	The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity;
PRO.29.10	and they seek the life of the upright.
PRO.29.11	A fool vents all of his anger,
PRO.29.11	but a wise man brings himself under control.
PRO.29.12	If a ruler listens to lies,
PRO.29.12	all of his officials are wicked.
PRO.29.13	The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:
PRO.29.13	The 
PRO.29.14	The king who fairly judges the poor,
PRO.29.14	his throne shall be established forever.
PRO.29.15	The rod of correction gives wisdom,
PRO.29.15	but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother.
PRO.29.16	When the wicked increase, sin increases;
PRO.29.16	but the righteous will see their downfall.
PRO.29.17	Correct your son, and he will give you peace;
PRO.29.17	yes, he will bring delight to your soul.
PRO.29.18	Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;
PRO.29.18	but one who keeps the law is blessed.
PRO.29.19	A servant can’t be corrected by words.
PRO.29.19	Though he understands, yet he will not respond.
PRO.29.20	Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.29.21	He who pampers his servant from youth
PRO.29.21	will have him become a son in the end.
PRO.29.22	An angry man stirs up strife,
PRO.29.22	and a wrathful man abounds in sin.
PRO.29.23	A man’s pride brings him low,
PRO.29.23	but one of lowly spirit gains honour.
PRO.29.24	Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul.
PRO.29.24	He takes an oath, but dares not testify.
PRO.29.25	The fear of man proves to be a snare,
PRO.29.25	but whoever puts his trust in the 
PRO.29.26	Many seek the ruler’s favour,
PRO.29.26	but a man’s justice comes from the 
PRO.29.27	A dishonest man detests the righteous,
PRO.29.27	and the upright in their ways detest the wicked.
PRO.30.1	The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the revelation:
PRO.30.1	the man says to Ithiel,
PRO.30.1	to Ithiel and Ucal:
PRO.30.2	“Surely I am the most ignorant man,
PRO.30.2	and don’t have a man’s understanding.
PRO.30.3	I have not learnt wisdom,
PRO.30.3	neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended?
PRO.30.4	Who has gathered the wind in his fists?
PRO.30.4	Who has bound the waters in his garment?
PRO.30.4	Who has established all the ends of the earth?
PRO.30.4	What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if you know?
PRO.30.5	“Every word of God is flawless.
PRO.30.5	He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
PRO.30.6	Don’t you add to his words,
PRO.30.6	lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.
PRO.30.7	“Two things I have asked of you.
PRO.30.7	Don’t deny me before I die.
PRO.30.8	Remove far from me falsehood and lies.
PRO.30.8	Give me neither poverty nor riches.
PRO.30.8	Feed me with the food that is needful for me,
PRO.30.9	lest I be full, deny you, and say, ‘Who is the 
PRO.30.9	or lest I be poor, and steal,
PRO.30.9	and so dishonour the name of my God.
PRO.30.10	“Don’t slander a servant to his master,
PRO.30.10	lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.
PRO.30.11	There is a generation that curses their father,
PRO.30.11	and doesn’t bless their mother.
PRO.30.12	There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,
PRO.30.12	yet are not washed from their filthiness.
PRO.30.13	There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!
PRO.30.13	Their eyelids are lifted up.
PRO.30.14	There is a generation whose teeth are like swords,
PRO.30.14	and their jaws like knives,
PRO.30.14	to devour the poor from the earth, and the needy from amongst men.
PRO.30.15	“The leech has two daughters:
PRO.30.15	‘Give, give.’
PRO.30.15	“There are three things that are never satisfied;
PRO.30.15	four that don’t say, ‘Enough:’
PRO.30.16	Sheol,
PRO.30.16	the barren womb,
PRO.30.16	the earth that is not satisfied with water,
PRO.30.16	and the fire that doesn’t say, ‘Enough.’
PRO.30.17	“The eye that mocks at his father,
PRO.30.17	and scorns obedience to his mother:
PRO.30.17	the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
PRO.30.17	the young eagles shall eat it.
PRO.30.18	“There are three things which are too amazing for me,
PRO.30.18	four which I don’t understand:
PRO.30.19	The way of an eagle in the air,
PRO.30.19	the way of a serpent on a rock,
PRO.30.19	the way of a ship in the middle of the sea,
PRO.30.19	and the way of a man with a maiden.
PRO.30.20	“So is the way of an adulterous woman:
PRO.30.20	She eats and wipes her mouth,
PRO.30.20	and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’
PRO.30.21	“For three things the earth trembles,
PRO.30.21	and under four, it can’t bear up:
PRO.30.22	For a servant when he is king,
PRO.30.22	a fool when he is filled with food,
PRO.30.23	for an unloved woman when she is married,
PRO.30.23	and a servant who is heir to her mistress.
PRO.30.24	“There are four things which are little on the earth,
PRO.30.24	but they are exceedingly wise:
PRO.30.25	The ants are not a strong people,
PRO.30.25	yet they provide their food in the summer.
PRO.30.26	The hyraxes are but a feeble folk,
PRO.30.26	yet make they their houses in the rocks.
PRO.30.27	The locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	yet they advance in ranks.
PRO.30.28	You can catch a lizard with your hands,
PRO.30.28	yet it is in kings’ palaces.
PRO.30.29	“There are three things which are stately in their march,
PRO.30.29	four which are stately in going:
PRO.30.30	The lion, which is mightiest amongst animals,
PRO.30.30	and doesn’t turn away for any;
PRO.30.31	the greyhound;
PRO.30.31	the male goat;
PRO.30.31	and the king against whom there is no rising up.
PRO.30.32	“If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself,
PRO.30.32	or if you have thought evil,
PRO.30.32	put your hand over your mouth.
PRO.30.33	For as the churning of milk produces butter,
PRO.30.33	and the wringing of the nose produces blood;
PRO.30.33	so the forcing of wrath produces strife.”
PRO.31.1	The words of king Lemuel; the revelation which his mother taught him.
PRO.31.2	“Oh, my son!
PRO.31.2	Oh, son of my womb!
PRO.31.2	Oh, son of my vows!
PRO.31.3	Don’t give your strength to women,
PRO.31.3	nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, Lemuel,
PRO.31.4	it is not for kings to drink wine,
PRO.31.4	nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’
PRO.31.5	lest they drink, and forget the law,
PRO.31.5	and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.
PRO.31.6	Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish,
PRO.31.6	and wine to the bitter in soul.
PRO.31.7	Let him drink, and forget his poverty,
PRO.31.7	and remember his misery no more.
PRO.31.8	Open your mouth for the mute,
PRO.31.8	in the cause of all who are left desolate.
PRO.31.9	Open your mouth, judge righteously,
PRO.31.9	and serve justice to the poor and needy.”
PRO.31.10	For her price is far above rubies.
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband trusts in her.
PRO.31.11	He shall have no lack of gain.
PRO.31.12	She does him good, and not harm,
PRO.31.12	all the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She seeks wool and flax,
PRO.31.13	and works eagerly with her hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like the merchant ships.
PRO.31.14	She brings her bread from afar.
PRO.31.15	She rises also while it is yet night,
PRO.31.15	gives food to her household,
PRO.31.15	and portions for her servant girls.
PRO.31.16	She considers a field, and buys it.
PRO.31.16	With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She arms her waist with strength,
PRO.31.17	and makes her arms strong.
PRO.31.18	She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.
PRO.31.18	Her lamp doesn’t go out by night.
PRO.31.19	She lays her hands to the distaff,
PRO.31.19	and her hands hold the spindle.
PRO.31.20	She opens her arms to the poor;
PRO.31.20	yes, she extends her hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid of the snow for her household;

PRO.31.22	She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.
PRO.31.22	Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is respected in the gates,
PRO.31.23	when he sits amongst the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She makes linen garments and sells them,

PRO.31.25	Strength and dignity are her clothing.
PRO.31.25	She laughs at the time to come.
PRO.31.26	She opens her mouth with wisdom.
PRO.31.26	Kind instruction is on her tongue.
PRO.31.27	She looks well to the ways of her household,
PRO.31.27	and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness.
PRO.31.28	Her children rise up and call her blessed.
PRO.31.28	Her husband also praises her:
PRO.31.29	“Many women do noble things,
PRO.31.29	but you excel them all.”
PRO.31.30	Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;
PRO.31.30	but a woman who fears the 
PRO.31.31	Give her of the fruit of her hands!
PRO.31.31	Let her works praise her in the gates!
ECC.1.1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
ECC.1.2	“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” 
ECC.1.3	What does man gain from all his labour in which he labours under the sun? 
ECC.1.4	One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever. 
ECC.1.5	The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises. 
ECC.1.6	The wind goes towards the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses. 
ECC.1.7	All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again. 
ECC.1.8	All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 
ECC.1.9	That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. 
ECC.1.10	Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold,
ECC.1.11	There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, amongst those that shall come after.
ECC.1.12	I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind. 
ECC.1.15	That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted. 
ECC.1.16	I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.” 
ECC.1.17	I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind. 
ECC.1.18	For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
ECC.2.1	I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with mirth: therefore enjoy pleasure;” and behold, this also was vanity. 
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, “It is foolishness;” and of mirth, “What does it accomplish?”
ECC.2.3	I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly, until I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their lives. 
ECC.2.4	I made myself great works. I built myself houses. I planted myself vineyards. 
ECC.2.5	I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit. 
ECC.2.6	I made myself pools of water, to water the forest where trees were grown. 
ECC.2.7	I bought male servants and female servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem. 
ECC.2.8	I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got myself male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men: musical instruments, and that of all sorts. 
ECC.2.9	So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me. 
ECC.2.10	Whatever my eyes desired, I didn’t keep from them. I didn’t withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labour, and this was my portion from all my labour. 
ECC.2.11	Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labour that I had laboured to do; and behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
ECC.2.12	I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly; for what can the king’s successor do? Just that which has been done long ago. 
ECC.2.13	Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness. 
ECC.2.14	The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness—and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all. 
ECC.2.15	Then I said in my heart, “As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?” Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity. 
ECC.2.16	For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory forever, since in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die just like the fool!
ECC.2.17	So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind. 
ECC.2.18	I hated all my labour in which I laboured under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who comes after me. 
ECC.2.19	Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of my labour in which I have laboured, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
ECC.2.20	Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour in which I had laboured under the sun. 
ECC.2.21	For there is a man whose labour is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not laboured for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. 
ECC.2.22	For what does a man have of all his labour and of the striving of his heart, in which he labours under the sun? 
ECC.2.23	For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity. 
ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. 
ECC.2.25	For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? 
ECC.2.26	For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
ECC.3.1	For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:
ECC.3.2	a time to be born,
ECC.3.2	and a time to die;
ECC.3.2	a time to plant,
ECC.3.2	and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
ECC.3.3	a time to kill,
ECC.3.3	and a time to heal;
ECC.3.3	a time to break down,
ECC.3.3	and a time to build up;
ECC.3.4	a time to weep,
ECC.3.4	and a time to laugh;
ECC.3.4	a time to mourn,
ECC.3.4	and a time to dance;
ECC.3.5	a time to cast away stones,
ECC.3.5	and a time to gather stones together;
ECC.3.5	a time to embrace,
ECC.3.5	and a time to refrain from embracing;
ECC.3.6	a time to seek,
ECC.3.6	and a time to lose;
ECC.3.6	a time to keep,
ECC.3.6	and a time to cast away;
ECC.3.7	a time to tear,
ECC.3.7	and a time to sew;
ECC.3.7	a time to keep silence,
ECC.3.7	and a time to speak;
ECC.3.8	a time to love,
ECC.3.8	and a time to hate;
ECC.3.8	a time for war,
ECC.3.8	and a time for peace.
ECC.3.9	What profit has he who works in that in which he labours? 
ECC.3.10	I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with. 
ECC.3.11	He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can’t find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end. 
ECC.3.12	I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live. 
ECC.3.13	Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labour, is the gift of God. 
ECC.3.14	I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God has done it, that men should fear before him. 
ECC.3.15	That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has been long ago. God seeks again that which is passed away.
ECC.3.16	Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there. 
ECC.3.17	I said in my heart, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.” 
ECC.3.18	I said in my heart, “As for the sons of men, God tests them, so that they may see that they themselves are like animals. 
ECC.3.19	For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all one breath; and man has no advantage over the animals; for all is vanity. 
ECC.3.20	All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all turn to dust again. 
ECC.3.21	Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes downward to the earth?”
ECC.3.22	Therefore I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who can bring him to see what will be after him?
ECC.4.1	Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. 
ECC.4.2	Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive. 
ECC.4.3	Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. 
ECC.4.4	Then I saw all the labour and achievement that is the envy of a man’s neighbour. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
ECC.4.5	The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself. 
ECC.4.6	Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labour and chasing after wind.
ECC.4.7	Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. 
ECC.4.8	There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. “For whom then, do I labour and deprive my soul of enjoyment?” This also is vanity. Yes, it is a miserable business.
ECC.4.9	Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labour. 
ECC.4.10	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn’t have another to lift him up. 
ECC.4.11	Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone? 
ECC.4.12	If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
ECC.4.13	Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn’t know how to receive admonition any more. 
ECC.4.14	For out of prison he came out to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor. 
ECC.4.15	I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him. 
ECC.4.16	There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was—yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
ECC.5.1	Guard your steps when you go to God’s house; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they don’t know that they do evil. 
ECC.5.2	Don’t be rash with your mouth, and don’t let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and you on earth. Therefore let your words be few. 
ECC.5.3	For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool’s speech with a multitude of words. 
ECC.5.4	When you vow a vow to God, don’t defer to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you vow. 
ECC.5.5	It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay. 
ECC.5.6	Don’t allow your mouth to lead you into sin. Don’t protest before the messenger that this was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands? 
ECC.5.7	For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well as in many words; but you must fear God.
ECC.5.8	If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a district, don’t marvel at the matter, for one official is eyed by a higher one, and there are officials over them. 
ECC.5.9	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all. The king profits from the field.
ECC.5.10	He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with increase: this also is vanity. 
ECC.5.11	When goods increase, those who eat them are increased; and what advantage is there to its owner, except to feast on them with his eyes?
ECC.5.12	The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.
ECC.5.13	There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm. 
ECC.5.14	Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son, there is nothing in his hand. 
ECC.5.15	As he came out of his mother’s womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. 
ECC.5.16	This also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he have who labours for the wind? 
ECC.5.17	All his days he also eats in darkness, he is frustrated, and has sickness and wrath.
ECC.5.18	Behold, that which I have seen to be good and proper is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labour, in which he labours under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him; for this is his portion. 
ECC.5.19	Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour—this is the gift of God. 
ECC.5.20	For he shall not often reflect on the days of his life; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.
ECC.6.1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy on men: 
ECC.6.2	a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honour, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God gives him no power to eat of it, but an alien eats it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
ECC.6.3	If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say that a stillborn child is better than he: 
ECC.6.4	for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness. 
ECC.6.5	Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it. This has rest rather than the other. 
ECC.6.6	Yes, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet fails to enjoy good, don’t all go to one place? 
ECC.6.7	All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. 
ECC.6.8	For what advantage has the wise more than the fool? What has the poor man, that knows how to walk before the living? 
ECC.6.9	Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind. 
ECC.6.10	Whatever has been, its name was given long ago; and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he. 
ECC.6.11	For there are many words that create vanity. What does that profit man? 
ECC.6.12	For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?
ECC.7.1	A good name is better than fine perfume; and the day of death better than the day of one’s birth. 
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and the living should take this to heart. 
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good. 
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. 
ECC.7.5	It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools. 
ECC.7.6	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity. 
ECC.7.7	Surely extortion makes the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroys the understanding. 
ECC.7.8	Better is the end of a thing than its beginning.
ECC.7.8	The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. 
ECC.7.9	Don’t be hasty in your spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools. 
ECC.7.10	Don’t say, “Why were the former days better than these?” For you do not ask wisely about this.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom is as good as an inheritance. Yes, it is more excellent for those who see the sun. 
ECC.7.12	For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God, for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked? 
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yes, God has made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything after him.
ECC.7.15	All this I have seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing. 
ECC.7.16	Don’t be overly righteous, neither make yourself overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself? 
ECC.7.17	Don’t be too wicked, neither be foolish. Why should you die before your time? 
ECC.7.18	It is good that you should take hold of this. Yes, also don’t withdraw your hand from that; for he who fears God will come out of them all. 
ECC.7.19	Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city. 
ECC.7.20	Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and doesn’t sin. 
ECC.7.21	Also don’t take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you; 
ECC.7.22	for often your own heart knows that you yourself have likewise cursed others. 
ECC.7.23	All this I have proved in wisdom. I said, “I will be wise;” but it was far from me. 
ECC.7.24	That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep. Who can find it out? 
ECC.7.25	I turned around, and my heart sought to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know that wickedness is stupidity, and that foolishness is madness.
ECC.7.26	I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and traps, whose hands are chains. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner will be ensnared by her.
ECC.7.27	“Behold, I have found this,” says the Preacher, “to one another, to find out the scheme 
ECC.7.28	which my soul still seeks, but I have not found. I have found one man amongst a thousand, but I have not found a woman amongst all those. 
ECC.7.29	Behold, I have only found this: that God made man upright; but they search for many schemes.”
ECC.8.1	Who is like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man’s wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed. 
ECC.8.2	I say, “Keep the king’s command!” because of the oath to God. 
ECC.8.3	Don’t be hasty to go out of his presence. Don’t persist in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him, 
ECC.8.4	for the king’s word is supreme. Who can say to him, “What are you doing?” 
ECC.8.5	Whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm, and his wise heart will know the time and procedure. 
ECC.8.6	For there is a time and procedure for every purpose, although the misery of man is heavy on him. 
ECC.8.7	For he doesn’t know that which will be; for who can tell him how it will be? 
ECC.8.8	There is no man who has power over the spirit to contain the spirit; neither does he have power over the day of death. There is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver those who practise it.
ECC.8.9	All this I have seen, and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt. 
ECC.8.10	So I saw the wicked buried. Indeed they came also from holiness. They went and were forgotten in the city where they did this. This also is vanity. 
ECC.8.11	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 
ECC.8.12	Though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long, yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him. 
ECC.8.13	But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow, because he doesn’t fear God.
ECC.8.14	There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked. Again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity. 
ECC.8.15	Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat, to drink, and to be joyful: for that will accompany him in his labour all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.
ECC.8.16	When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth (even though eyes see no sleep day or night), 
ECC.8.17	then I saw all the work of God, that man can’t find out the work that is done under the sun, because however much a man labours to seek it out, yet he won’t find it. Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it, he won’t be able to find it.
ECC.9.1	For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn’t know it; all is before them. 
ECC.9.2	All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean, to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn’t sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath, as he who fears an oath. 
ECC.9.3	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. 
ECC.9.4	For to him who is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion. 
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they will die, but the dead don’t know anything, neither do they have any more a reward; for their memory is forgotten. 
ECC.9.6	Also their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago; neither do they any longer have a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.
ECC.9.7	Go your way—eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works. 
ECC.9.8	Let your garments be always white, and don’t let your head lack oil. 
ECC.9.9	Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your life of vanity, which he has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity, for that is your portion in life, and in your labour in which you labour under the sun. 
ECC.9.10	Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor plan, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol,
ECC.9.11	I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all. 
ECC.9.12	For man also doesn’t know his time. As the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.
ECC.9.13	I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it seemed great to me. 
ECC.9.14	There was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it. 
ECC.9.15	Now a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. 
ECC.9.16	Then I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” Nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard. 
ECC.9.17	The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him who rules amongst fools. 
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good.
ECC.10.1	Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to produce an evil odour;
ECC.10.1	so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honour.
ECC.10.2	A wise man’s heart is at his right hand,
ECC.10.2	but a fool’s heart at his left. 
ECC.10.3	Yes also when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool. 
ECC.10.4	If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don’t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offences to rest.
ECC.10.5	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler. 
ECC.10.6	Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place. 
ECC.10.7	I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth. 
ECC.10.8	He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. 
ECC.10.9	Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered by it. 
ECC.10.10	If the axe is blunt, and one doesn’t sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.
ECC.10.11	If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer’s tongue. 
ECC.10.12	The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips. 
ECC.10.13	The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. 
ECC.10.14	A fool also multiplies words.
ECC.10.14	Man doesn’t know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him? 
ECC.10.15	The labour of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn’t know how to go to the city.
ECC.10.16	Woe to you, land, when your king is a child,
ECC.10.16	and your princes eat in the morning!
ECC.10.17	Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles,
ECC.10.17	and your princes eat in due season,
ECC.10.17	for strength, and not for drunkenness!
ECC.10.18	By slothfulness the roof sinks in;
ECC.10.18	and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.
ECC.10.19	A feast is made for laughter,
ECC.10.19	and wine makes the life glad;
ECC.10.19	and money is the answer for all things.
ECC.10.20	Don’t curse the king, no, not in your thoughts;
ECC.10.20	and don’t curse the rich in your bedroom:
ECC.10.20	for a bird of the sky may carry your voice,
ECC.10.20	and that which has wings may tell the matter.
ECC.11.1	Cast your bread on the waters;
ECC.11.1	for you shall find it after many days.
ECC.11.2	Give a portion to seven, yes, even to eight;
ECC.11.2	for you don’t know what evil will be on the earth.
ECC.11.3	If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth;
ECC.11.3	and if a tree falls towards the south, or towards the north,
ECC.11.3	in the place where the tree falls, there shall it be.
ECC.11.4	He who observes the wind won’t sow;
ECC.11.4	and he who regards the clouds won’t reap.
ECC.11.5	As you don’t know what is the way of the wind,
ECC.11.5	nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child;
ECC.11.5	even so you don’t know the work of God who does all.
ECC.11.6	In the morning sow your seed,
ECC.11.6	and in the evening don’t withhold your hand;
ECC.11.6	for you don’t know which will prosper, whether this or that,
ECC.11.6	or whether they both will be equally good.
ECC.11.7	Truly the light is sweet,
ECC.11.7	and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to see the sun.
ECC.11.8	Yes, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all;
ECC.11.8	but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many.
ECC.11.8	All that comes is vanity.
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, young man, in your youth,
ECC.11.9	and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth,
ECC.11.9	and walk in the ways of your heart,
ECC.11.9	and in the sight of your eyes;
ECC.11.9	but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgement.
ECC.11.10	Therefore remove sorrow from your heart,
ECC.11.10	and put away evil from your flesh;
ECC.11.10	for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
ECC.12.1	Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,
ECC.12.1	before the evil days come, and the years draw near,
ECC.12.1	when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them;”
ECC.12.2	Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,
ECC.12.2	and the clouds return after the rain;
ECC.12.3	in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,
ECC.12.3	and the strong men shall bow themselves,
ECC.12.3	and the grinders cease because they are few,
ECC.12.3	and those who look out of the windows are darkened,
ECC.12.4	and the doors shall be shut in the street;
ECC.12.4	when the sound of the grinding is low,
ECC.12.4	and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird,
ECC.12.4	and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
ECC.12.5	yes, they shall be afraid of heights,
ECC.12.5	and terrors will be on the way;
ECC.12.5	and the almond tree shall blossom,
ECC.12.5	and the grasshopper shall be a burden,
ECC.12.5	and desire shall fail;
ECC.12.5	because man goes to his everlasting home,
ECC.12.5	and the mourners go about the streets:
ECC.12.6	before the silver cord is severed,
ECC.12.6	or the golden bowl is broken,
ECC.12.6	or the pitcher is broken at the spring,
ECC.12.6	or the wheel broken at the cistern,
ECC.12.7	and the dust returns to the earth as it was,
ECC.12.7	and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
ECC.12.8	“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher.
ECC.12.8	“All is vanity!”
ECC.12.9	Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs. 
ECC.12.10	The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth. 
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd. 
ECC.12.12	Furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
ECC.12.13	This is the end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man. 
ECC.12.14	For God will bring every work into judgement, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.
SNG.1.1	The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s.
SNG.1.2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;
SNG.1.2	for your love is better than wine.
SNG.1.3	Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.
SNG.1.3	Your name is oil poured out,
SNG.1.3	therefore the virgins love you.
SNG.1.4	Take me away with you.
SNG.1.4	Let’s hurry.
SNG.1.4	The king has brought me into his rooms.
SNG.1.4	We will be glad and rejoice in you.
SNG.1.4	We will praise your love more than wine!
SNG.1.4	They are right to love you.
SNG.1.5	I am dark, but lovely,
SNG.1.5	you daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.1.5	like Kedar’s tents,
SNG.1.5	like Solomon’s curtains.
SNG.1.6	Don’t stare at me because I am dark,
SNG.1.6	because the sun has scorched me.
SNG.1.6	My mother’s sons were angry with me.
SNG.1.6	They made me keeper of the vineyards.
SNG.1.6	I haven’t kept my own vineyard.
SNG.1.7	Tell me, you whom my soul loves,
SNG.1.7	where you graze your flock,
SNG.1.7	where you rest them at noon;
SNG.1.7	for why should I be as one who is veiled
SNG.1.7	beside the flocks of your companions?
SNG.1.8	If you don’t know, most beautiful amongst women,
SNG.1.8	follow the tracks of the sheep.
SNG.1.8	Graze your young goats beside the shepherds’ tents.
SNG.1.9	I have compared you, my love,
SNG.1.9	to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.
SNG.1.10	Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings,
SNG.1.10	your neck with strings of jewels.
SNG.1.11	We will make you earrings of gold,
SNG.1.11	with studs of silver.
SNG.1.12	While the king sat at his table,
SNG.1.12	my perfume spread its fragrance.
SNG.1.13	My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh,
SNG.1.13	that lies between my breasts.
SNG.1.14	My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms
SNG.1.14	from the vineyards of En Gedi.
SNG.1.15	Behold,
SNG.1.15	Behold, you are beautiful.
SNG.1.15	Your eyes are like doves.
SNG.1.16	Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant;
SNG.1.16	and our couch is verdant.
SNG.1.17	The beams of our house are cedars.
SNG.1.17	Our rafters are firs.
SNG.2.1	I am a rose of Sharon,
SNG.2.1	a lily of the valleys.
SNG.2.2	As a lily amongst thorns,
SNG.2.2	so is my love amongst the daughters.
SNG.2.3	As the apple tree amongst the trees of the wood,
SNG.2.3	so is my beloved amongst the sons.
SNG.2.3	I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
SNG.2.3	his fruit was sweet to my taste.
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the banquet hall.
SNG.2.4	His banner over me is love.
SNG.2.5	Strengthen me with raisins,
SNG.2.5	refresh me with apples;
SNG.2.5	for I am faint with love.
SNG.2.6	His left hand is under my head.
SNG.2.6	His right hand embraces me.
SNG.2.7	I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.2.7	by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,
SNG.2.7	that you not stir up, nor awaken love,
SNG.2.7	until it so desires.
SNG.2.8	The voice of my beloved!
SNG.2.8	Behold, he comes,
SNG.2.8	leaping on the mountains,
SNG.2.8	skipping on the hills.
SNG.2.9	My beloved is like a roe or a young deer.
SNG.2.9	Behold, he stands behind our wall!
SNG.2.9	He looks in at the windows.
SNG.2.9	He glances through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My beloved spoke, and said to me,
SNG.2.10	“Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
SNG.2.11	For behold, the winter is past.
SNG.2.11	The rain is over and gone.
SNG.2.12	The flowers appear on the earth.
SNG.2.12	The time of the singing has come,
SNG.2.12	and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
SNG.2.13	The fig tree ripens her green figs.
SNG.2.13	The vines are in blossom.
SNG.2.13	They give out their fragrance.
SNG.2.13	Arise, my love, my beautiful one,
SNG.2.13	and come away.”
SNG.2.14	My dove in the clefts of the rock,
SNG.2.14	in the hiding places of the mountainside,
SNG.2.14	let me see your face.
SNG.2.14	let me hear your voice;
SNG.2.14	for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely.
SNG.2.15	Catch for us the foxes,
SNG.2.15	the little foxes that plunder the vineyards;
SNG.2.15	for our vineyards are in blossom.
SNG.2.16	My beloved is mine, and I am his.
SNG.2.16	He browses amongst the lilies.
SNG.2.17	Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,
SNG.2.17	turn, my beloved,
SNG.2.17	and be like a roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether.
SNG.3.1	By night on my bed,
SNG.3.1	I sought him whom my soul loves.
SNG.3.1	I sought him, but I didn’t find him.
SNG.3.2	I will get up now, and go about the city;
SNG.3.2	in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves.
SNG.3.2	I sought him, but I didn’t find him.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen who go about the city found me;
SNG.3.3	“Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”
SNG.3.4	I had scarcely passed from them,
SNG.3.4	when I found him whom my soul loves.
SNG.3.4	I held him, and would not let him go,
SNG.3.4	until I had brought him into my mother’s house,
SNG.3.4	into the room of her who conceived me.
SNG.3.5	I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.3.5	by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,
SNG.3.5	that you not stir up nor awaken love,
SNG.3.5	until it so desires.
SNG.3.6	Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke,
SNG.3.6	perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
SNG.3.6	with all spices of the merchant?
SNG.3.7	Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage!
SNG.3.7	Sixty mighty men are around it,
SNG.3.7	of the mighty men of Israel.
SNG.3.8	They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.
SNG.3.8	Every man has his sword on his thigh,
SNG.3.8	because of fear in the night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon made himself a carriage
SNG.3.9	of the wood of Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	He made its pillars of silver,
SNG.3.10	its bottom of gold, its seat of purple,
SNG.3.10	the middle of it being paved with love,
SNG.3.10	from the daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Go out, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon,
SNG.3.11	with the crown with which his mother has crowned him,
SNG.3.11	in the day of his weddings,
SNG.3.11	in the day of the gladness of his heart.
SNG.4.1	Behold, you are beautiful, my love.
SNG.4.1	Behold, you are beautiful.
SNG.4.1	Your eyes are like doves behind your veil.
SNG.4.1	Your hair is as a flock of goats,
SNG.4.1	that descend from Mount Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock,
SNG.4.2	which have come up from the washing,
SNG.4.2	where every one of them has twins.
SNG.4.2	None is bereaved amongst them.
SNG.4.3	Your lips are like scarlet thread.
SNG.4.3	Your mouth is lovely.
SNG.4.3	Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.
SNG.4.4	Your neck is like David’s tower built for an armoury,
SNG.4.4	on which a thousand shields hang,
SNG.4.4	all the shields of the mighty men.
SNG.4.5	Your two breasts are like two fawns
SNG.4.5	that are twins of a roe,
SNG.4.5	which feed amongst the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,
SNG.4.6	I will go to the mountain of myrrh,
SNG.4.6	to the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	You are all beautiful, my love.
SNG.4.7	There is no spot in you.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
SNG.4.8	with me from Lebanon.
SNG.4.8	Look from the top of Amana,
SNG.4.8	from the top of Senir and Hermon,
SNG.4.8	from the lions’ dens,
SNG.4.8	from the mountains of the leopards.
SNG.4.9	You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.
SNG.4.9	You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes,
SNG.4.9	with one chain of your neck.
SNG.4.10	How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!
SNG.4.10	How much better is your love than wine,
SNG.4.10	the fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices!
SNG.4.11	Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb.
SNG.4.11	Honey and milk are under your tongue.
SNG.4.11	The smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	My sister, my bride, is a locked up garden;
SNG.4.12	a locked up spring,
SNG.4.12	a sealed fountain.
SNG.4.13	Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits,
SNG.4.13	henna with spikenard plants,
SNG.4.14	spikenard and saffron,
SNG.4.14	calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree;
SNG.4.14	myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices,
SNG.4.15	a fountain of gardens,
SNG.4.15	a well of living waters,
SNG.4.15	flowing streams from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awake, north wind, and come, you south!
SNG.4.16	Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out.
SNG.4.16	Let my beloved come into his garden,
SNG.4.16	and taste his precious fruits.
SNG.5.1	I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride.
SNG.5.1	I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;
SNG.5.1	I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
SNG.5.1	I have drunk my wine with my milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, friends!
SNG.5.1	Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.
SNG.5.2	I was asleep, but my heart was awake.
SNG.5.2	It is the voice of my beloved who knocks:
SNG.5.2	“Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled;
SNG.5.2	for my head is filled with dew,
SNG.5.2	and my hair with the dampness of the night.”
SNG.5.3	I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on?
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?
SNG.5.4	My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.
SNG.5.4	My heart pounded for him.
SNG.5.5	I rose up to open for my beloved.
SNG.5.5	My hands dripped with myrrh,
SNG.5.5	my fingers with liquid myrrh,
SNG.5.5	on the handles of the lock.
SNG.5.6	I opened to my beloved;
SNG.5.6	but my beloved left, and had gone away.
SNG.5.6	My heart went out when he spoke.
SNG.5.6	I looked for him, but I didn’t find him.
SNG.5.6	I called him, but he didn’t answer.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen who go about the city found me.
SNG.5.7	They beat me.
SNG.5.7	They bruised me.
SNG.5.7	The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me.
SNG.5.8	I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.8	If you find my beloved,
SNG.5.8	that you tell him that I am faint with love.
SNG.5.9	How is your beloved better than another beloved,
SNG.5.9	you fairest amongst women?
SNG.5.9	How is your beloved better than another beloved,
SNG.5.9	that you do so adjure us?
SNG.5.10	My beloved is white and ruddy.
SNG.5.10	The best amongst ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head is like the purest gold.
SNG.5.11	His hair is bushy, black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks,
SNG.5.12	washed with milk, mounted like jewels.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes.
SNG.5.13	His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl.
SNG.5.14	His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.
SNG.5.15	His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold.
SNG.5.15	His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
SNG.5.16	His mouth is sweetness;
SNG.5.16	yes, he is altogether lovely.
SNG.5.16	This is my beloved, and this is my friend,
SNG.5.16	daughters of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	Where has your beloved gone, you fairest amongst women?
SNG.6.1	Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?
SNG.6.2	My beloved has gone down to his garden,
SNG.6.2	to the beds of spices,
SNG.6.2	to pasture his flock in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine.
SNG.6.3	He browses amongst the lilies.
SNG.6.4	You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah,
SNG.6.4	lovely as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	awesome as an army with banners.
SNG.6.5	Turn away your eyes from me,
SNG.6.5	for they have overcome me.
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like a flock of goats,
SNG.6.5	that lie along the side of Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are like a flock of ewes,
SNG.6.6	which have come up from the washing,
SNG.6.6	of which every one has twins;
SNG.6.6	not one is bereaved amongst them.
SNG.6.7	Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.
SNG.6.8	There are sixty queens, eighty concubines,
SNG.6.8	and virgins without number.
SNG.6.9	My dove, my perfect one, is unique.
SNG.6.9	She is her mother’s only daughter.
SNG.6.9	She is the favourite one of her who bore her.
SNG.6.9	The daughters saw her, and called her blessed.
SNG.6.9	The queens and the concubines saw her, and they praised her.
SNG.6.10	Who is she who looks out as the morning,
SNG.6.10	beautiful as the moon,
SNG.6.10	clear as the sun,
SNG.6.10	and awesome as an army with banners?
SNG.6.11	I went down into the nut tree grove,
SNG.6.11	to see the green plants of the valley,
SNG.6.11	to see whether the vine budded,
SNG.6.11	and the pomegranates were in flower.
SNG.6.12	Without realising it,
SNG.6.12	my desire set me with my royal people’s chariots.
SNG.6.13	Return, return, Shulammite!
SNG.6.13	Return, return, that we may gaze at you.
SNG.6.13	Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite,
SNG.6.13	as at the dance of Mahanaim?
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince’s daughter!
SNG.7.1	Your rounded thighs are like jewels,
SNG.7.1	the work of the hands of a skilful workman.
SNG.7.2	Your body is like a round goblet,
SNG.7.2	no mixed wine is wanting.
SNG.7.2	Your waist is like a heap of wheat,
SNG.7.2	set about with lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your two breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.7.3	that are twins of a roe.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like an ivory tower.
SNG.7.4	Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks towards Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head on you is like Carmel.
SNG.7.5	The hair of your head like purple.
SNG.7.5	The king is held captive in its tresses.
SNG.7.6	How beautiful and how pleasant you are,
SNG.7.6	love, for delights!
SNG.7.7	This, your stature, is like a palm tree,
SNG.7.7	your breasts like its fruit.
SNG.7.8	I said, “I will climb up into the palm tree.
SNG.7.8	I will take hold of its fruit.”
SNG.7.8	Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
SNG.7.8	the smell of your breath like apples.
SNG.7.9	Your mouth is like the best wine,
SNG.7.9	that goes down smoothly for my beloved,
SNG.7.9	gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.
SNG.7.10	I am my beloved’s.
SNG.7.10	His desire is towards me.
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved! Let’s go out into the field.
SNG.7.11	Let’s lodge in the villages.
SNG.7.12	Let’s go early up to the vineyards.
SNG.7.12	Let’s see whether the vine has budded,
SNG.7.12	its blossom is open,
SNG.7.12	and the pomegranates are in flower.
SNG.7.12	There I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes produce fragrance.
SNG.7.13	At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old,
SNG.7.13	which I have stored up for you, my beloved.
SNG.8.1	Oh that you were like my brother,
SNG.8.1	who nursed from the breasts of my mother!
SNG.8.1	If I found you outside, I would kiss you;
SNG.8.1	yes, and no one would despise me.
SNG.8.2	I would lead you, bringing you into the house of my mother,
SNG.8.2	who would instruct me.
SNG.8.2	I would have you drink spiced wine,
SNG.8.2	of the juice of my pomegranate.
SNG.8.3	His left hand would be under my head.
SNG.8.3	His right hand would embrace me.
SNG.8.4	I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	that you not stir up, nor awaken love,
SNG.8.4	until it so desires.
SNG.8.5	Who is this who comes up from the wilderness,
SNG.8.5	leaning on her beloved?
SNG.8.5	Under the apple tree I awakened you.
SNG.8.5	There your mother conceived you.
SNG.8.5	There she was in labour and bore you.
SNG.8.6	Set me as a seal on your heart,
SNG.8.6	as a seal on your arm;
SNG.8.6	for love is strong as death.
SNG.8.6	Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.
SNG.8.6	Its flashes are flashes of fire,
SNG.8.6	a very flame of the 
SNG.8.7	Many waters can’t quench love,
SNG.8.7	neither can floods drown it.
SNG.8.7	If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,
SNG.8.7	he would be utterly scorned.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister.
SNG.8.8	She has no breasts.
SNG.8.8	What shall we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	in the day when she is to be spoken for?
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall,
SNG.8.9	we will build on her a turret of silver.
SNG.8.9	If she is a door,
SNG.8.9	we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
SNG.8.10	I am a wall, and my breasts like towers,
SNG.8.10	then I was in his eyes like one who found peace.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon.
SNG.8.11	He leased out the vineyard to keepers.
SNG.8.11	Each was to bring a thousand shekels
SNG.8.12	My own vineyard is before me.
SNG.8.12	The thousand are for you, Solomon,
SNG.8.12	two hundred for those who tend its fruit.
SNG.8.13	You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance,
SNG.8.13	let me hear your voice!
SNG.8.14	Come away, my beloved!
SNG.8.14	Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!
ISA.1.1	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
ISA.1.2	Hear, heavens,
ISA.1.2	and listen, earth; for the 
ISA.1.2	“I have nourished and brought up children
ISA.1.2	and they have rebelled against me.
ISA.1.3	The ox knows his owner,
ISA.1.3	and the donkey his master’s crib;
ISA.1.3	but Israel doesn’t know.
ISA.1.3	My people don’t consider.”
ISA.1.4	Ah sinful nation,
ISA.1.4	a people loaded with iniquity,
ISA.1.4	offspring
ISA.1.4	children who deal corruptly!
ISA.1.4	They have forsaken the 
ISA.1.4	They have despised the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.1.4	They are estranged and backward.
ISA.1.5	Why should you be beaten more,
ISA.1.5	that you revolt more and more?
ISA.1.5	The whole head is sick,
ISA.1.5	and the whole heart faint.
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it:
ISA.1.6	wounds, welts, and open sores.
ISA.1.6	They haven’t been closed, bandaged, or soothed with oil.
ISA.1.7	Your country is desolate.
ISA.1.7	Your cities are burnt with fire.
ISA.1.7	Strangers devour your land in your presence
ISA.1.7	and it is desolate,
ISA.1.7	as overthrown by strangers.
ISA.1.8	The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,
ISA.1.8	like a hut in a field of melons,
ISA.1.8	like a besieged city.
ISA.1.9	Unless the 
ISA.1.9	we would have been as Sodom.
ISA.1.9	We would have been like Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	Hear the 
ISA.1.10	Listen to the law of our God,
ISA.1.11	“What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?”, says the 
ISA.1.11	“I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams
ISA.1.11	and the fat of fed animals.
ISA.1.11	I don’t delight in the blood of bulls,
ISA.1.11	or of lambs,
ISA.1.11	or of male goats.
ISA.1.12	When you come to appear before me,
ISA.1.12	who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
ISA.1.13	Bring no more vain offerings.
ISA.1.13	Incense is an abomination to me.
ISA.1.13	New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:
ISA.1.13	I can’t stand evil assemblies.
ISA.1.14	My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts.
ISA.1.14	They are a burden to me.
ISA.1.14	I am weary of bearing them.
ISA.1.15	When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.
ISA.1.15	Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.
ISA.1.15	Your hands are full of blood.
ISA.1.16	Wash yourselves. Make yourself clean.
ISA.1.16	Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes.
ISA.1.16	Cease to do evil.
ISA.1.17	Learn to do well.
ISA.1.17	Seek justice.
ISA.1.17	Relieve the oppressed.
ISA.1.17	Defend the fatherless.
ISA.1.17	Plead for the widow.”
ISA.1.18	“Come now, and let’s reason together,” says the 
ISA.1.18	“Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
ISA.1.18	Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
ISA.1.19	If you are willing and obedient,
ISA.1.19	you will eat the good of the land;
ISA.1.20	but if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured with the sword;
ISA.1.20	for the the 
ISA.1.21	How the faithful city has become a prostitute!
ISA.1.21	She was full of justice.
ISA.1.21	Righteousness lodged in her,
ISA.1.21	but now there are murderers.
ISA.1.22	Your silver has become dross,
ISA.1.22	your wine mixed with water.
ISA.1.23	Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves.
ISA.1.23	Everyone loves bribes and follows after rewards.
ISA.1.23	They don’t defend the fatherless,
ISA.1.23	neither does the cause of the widow come to them.
ISA.1.24	Therefore the Lord,
ISA.1.24	the Mighty One of Israel, says:
ISA.1.24	“Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,
ISA.1.24	and avenge myself on my enemies.
ISA.1.25	I will turn my hand on you,
ISA.1.25	thoroughly purge away your dross,
ISA.1.25	and will take away all your tin.
ISA.1.26	I will restore your judges as at the first,
ISA.1.26	and your counsellors as at the beginning.
ISA.1.26	Afterward you shall be called ‘The city of righteousness,
ISA.1.26	a faithful town.’
ISA.1.27	Zion shall be redeemed with justice,
ISA.1.27	and her converts with righteousness.
ISA.1.28	But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,
ISA.1.28	and those who forsake the 
ISA.1.29	For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
ISA.1.29	and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
ISA.1.30	For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades,
ISA.1.30	and as a garden that has no water.
ISA.1.31	The strong will be like tinder,
ISA.1.31	and his work like a spark.
ISA.1.31	They will both burn together,
ISA.1.31	and no one will quench them.”
ISA.2.1	This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
ISA.2.2	It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of the 
ISA.2.2	and shall be raised above the hills;
ISA.2.2	and all nations shall flow to it.
ISA.2.3	Many peoples shall go and say,
ISA.2.3	“Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.3	to the house of the God of Jacob;
ISA.2.3	and he will teach us of his ways,
ISA.2.3	and we will walk in his paths.”
ISA.2.3	For the law shall go out of Zion,
ISA.2.3	and the 
ISA.2.4	He will judge between the nations,
ISA.2.4	and will decide concerning many peoples.
ISA.2.4	They shall beat their swords into ploughshares,
ISA.2.4	and their spears into pruning hooks.
ISA.2.4	Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
ISA.2.4	neither shall they learn war any more.
ISA.2.5	House of Jacob, come, and let’s walk in the light of the 
ISA.2.6	For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,
ISA.2.6	because they are filled from the east,
ISA.2.6	with those who practise divination like the Philistines,
ISA.2.6	and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.
ISA.2.7	Their land is full of silver and gold,
ISA.2.7	neither is there any end of their treasures.
ISA.2.7	Their land also is full of horses,
ISA.2.7	neither is there any end of their chariots.
ISA.2.8	Their land also is full of idols.
ISA.2.8	They worship the work of their own hands,
ISA.2.8	that which their own fingers have made.
ISA.2.9	Man is brought low,
ISA.2.9	and mankind is humbled;
ISA.2.9	therefore don’t forgive them.
ISA.2.10	Enter into the rock,
ISA.2.10	and hide in the dust,
ISA.2.10	from before the terror of the 
ISA.2.10	and from the glory of his majesty.
ISA.2.11	The lofty looks of man will be brought low,
ISA.2.11	the arrogance of men will be bowed down,
ISA.2.11	and the 
ISA.2.12	For there will be a day of the 
ISA.2.12	and for all that is lifted up;
ISA.2.12	and it shall be brought low:
ISA.2.13	for all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,
ISA.2.13	for all the oaks of Bashan,
ISA.2.14	for all the high mountains,
ISA.2.14	for all the hills that are lifted up,
ISA.2.15	for every lofty tower,
ISA.2.15	for every fortified wall,
ISA.2.16	for all the ships of Tarshish,
ISA.2.16	and for all pleasant imagery.
ISA.2.17	The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,
ISA.2.17	and the arrogance of men shall be brought low;
ISA.2.17	and the 
ISA.2.18	The idols shall utterly pass away.
ISA.2.19	Men shall go into the caves of the rocks,
ISA.2.19	and into the holes of the earth,
ISA.2.19	from before the terror of the 
ISA.2.19	and from the glory of his majesty,
ISA.2.19	when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
ISA.2.20	In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver
ISA.2.20	and their idols of gold,
ISA.2.20	which have been made for themselves to worship,
ISA.2.20	to the moles and to the bats,
ISA.2.21	to go into the caverns of the rocks,
ISA.2.21	and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,
ISA.2.21	from before the terror of the 
ISA.2.21	and from the glory of his majesty,
ISA.2.21	when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
ISA.2.22	Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;
ISA.2.22	for of what account is he?
ISA.3.1	For, behold,
ISA.3.1	the whole supply of bread,
ISA.3.1	and the whole supply of water;
ISA.3.2	the mighty man,
ISA.3.2	the man of war,
ISA.3.2	the judge,
ISA.3.2	the prophet,
ISA.3.2	the diviner,
ISA.3.2	the elder,
ISA.3.3	the captain of fifty,
ISA.3.3	the honourable man,
ISA.3.3	the counsellor,
ISA.3.3	the skilled craftsman,
ISA.3.3	and the clever enchanter.
ISA.3.4	I will give boys to be their princes,
ISA.3.4	and children shall rule over them.
ISA.3.5	The people will be oppressed,
ISA.3.5	everyone by another,
ISA.3.5	and everyone by his neighbour.
ISA.3.5	The child will behave himself proudly against the old man,
ISA.3.5	and the wicked against the honourable.
ISA.3.6	Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying,
ISA.3.6	“You have clothing, you be our ruler,
ISA.3.6	and let this ruin be under your hand.”
ISA.3.7	In that day he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a healer;
ISA.3.7	for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.
ISA.3.7	You shall not make me ruler of the people.”
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen;
ISA.3.8	because their tongue and their doings are against the 
ISA.3.8	to provoke the eyes of his glory.
ISA.3.9	The look of their faces testify against them.
ISA.3.9	They parade their sin like Sodom.
ISA.3.9	They don’t hide it.
ISA.3.9	Woe to their soul!
ISA.3.9	For they have brought disaster upon themselves.
ISA.3.10	Tell the righteous “Good!”
ISA.3.10	For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
ISA.3.11	Woe to the wicked!
ISA.3.11	Disaster is upon them;
ISA.3.11	for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him.
ISA.3.12	As for my people, children are their oppressors,
ISA.3.12	and women rule over them.
ISA.3.12	My people, those who lead you cause you to err,
ISA.3.12	and destroy the way of your paths.
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.13	and stands to judge the peoples.
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.14	and their leaders:
ISA.3.14	“It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.
ISA.3.14	The plunder of the poor is in your houses.
ISA.3.15	What do you mean that you crush my people,
ISA.3.15	and grind the face of the poor?” says the Lord, the 
ISA.3.16	Moreover the 
ISA.3.16	and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,
ISA.3.16	walking to trip as they go,
ISA.3.16	jingling ornaments on their feet;
ISA.3.17	therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion,
ISA.3.17	and the 
ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces, 
ISA.3.19	the earrings, the bracelets, the veils, 
ISA.3.20	the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume containers, the charms, 
ISA.3.21	the signet rings, the nose rings, 
ISA.3.22	the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses, 
ISA.3.23	the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.
ISA.3.24	It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness;
ISA.3.24	instead of a belt, a rope;
ISA.3.24	instead of well set hair, baldness;
ISA.3.24	instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth;
ISA.3.24	and branding instead of beauty.
ISA.3.25	Your men shall fall by the sword,
ISA.3.25	and your mighty in the war.
ISA.3.26	Her gates shall lament and mourn.
ISA.3.26	She shall be desolate and sit on the ground.
ISA.4.1	Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing. Just let us be called by your name. Take away our reproach.”
ISA.4.2	In that day, the 
ISA.4.3	It will happen that he who is left in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem shall be called holy, even everyone who is written amongst the living in Jerusalem, 
ISA.4.4	when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from within it, by the spirit of justice and by the spirit of burning. 
ISA.4.5	The 
ISA.4.6	There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.
ISA.5.1	Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard.
ISA.5.1	My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.
ISA.5.2	He dug it up,
ISA.5.2	gathered out its stones,
ISA.5.2	planted it with the choicest vine,
ISA.5.2	built a tower in the middle of it,
ISA.5.2	and also cut out a wine press in it.
ISA.5.2	He looked for it to yield grapes,
ISA.5.2	but it yielded wild grapes.
ISA.5.3	“Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,
ISA.5.3	please judge between me and my vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?
ISA.5.4	Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?
ISA.5.5	Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.
ISA.5.5	I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.
ISA.5.5	I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled down.
ISA.5.6	I will lay it a wasteland.
ISA.5.6	It won’t be pruned or hoed,
ISA.5.6	but it will grow briers and thorns.
ISA.5.6	I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.”
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.7	and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:
ISA.5.7	and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression;
ISA.5.7	for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress.
ISA.5.8	Woe to those who join house to house,
ISA.5.8	who lay field to field, until there is no room,
ISA.5.8	and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the land!
ISA.5.9	In my ears, the 
ISA.5.9	even great and beautiful, unoccupied.
ISA.5.10	For ten acres
ISA.5.10	and a homer
ISA.5.11	Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink,
ISA.5.11	who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!
ISA.5.12	The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts;
ISA.5.12	but they don’t respect the work of the 
ISA.5.12	neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.
ISA.5.13	Their honourable men are famished,
ISA.5.13	and their multitudes are parched with thirst.
ISA.5.14	Therefore Sheol
ISA.5.14	and opened its mouth without measure;
ISA.5.14	and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices amongst them, descend into it.
ISA.5.15	So man is brought low,
ISA.5.15	mankind is humbled,
ISA.5.15	and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;
ISA.5.16	but the 
ISA.5.16	and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.
ISA.5.17	Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,
ISA.5.17	and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.
ISA.5.18	Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,
ISA.5.18	and wickedness as with cart rope,
ISA.5.19	who say, “Let him make haste, let him hasten his work, that we may see it;
ISA.5.19	let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,
ISA.5.19	that we may know it!”
ISA.5.20	Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;
ISA.5.20	who put darkness for light,
ISA.5.20	and light for darkness;
ISA.5.20	who put bitter for sweet,
ISA.5.20	and sweet for bitter!
ISA.5.21	Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,
ISA.5.21	and prudent in their own sight!
ISA.5.22	Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine,
ISA.5.22	and champions at mixing strong drink;
ISA.5.23	who acquit the guilty for a bribe,
ISA.5.23	but deny justice for the innocent!
ISA.5.24	Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
ISA.5.24	and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame,
ISA.5.24	so their root shall be as rottenness,
ISA.5.24	and their blossom shall go up as dust,
ISA.5.24	because they have rejected the law of the 
ISA.5.24	and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.5.25	Therefore the 
ISA.5.25	and he has stretched out his hand against them and has struck them.
ISA.5.25	The mountains tremble,
ISA.5.25	and their dead bodies are as refuse in the middle of the streets.
ISA.5.25	For all this, his anger is not turned away,
ISA.5.25	but his hand is still stretched out.
ISA.5.26	He will lift up a banner to the nations from far away,
ISA.5.26	and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth.
ISA.5.26	Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.
ISA.5.27	No one shall be weary nor stumble amongst them;
ISA.5.27	no one shall slumber nor sleep,
ISA.5.27	neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,
ISA.5.27	nor the strap of their sandals be broken,
ISA.5.28	whose arrows are sharp,
ISA.5.28	and all their bows bent.
ISA.5.28	Their horses’ hoofs will be like flint,
ISA.5.28	and their wheels like a whirlwind.
ISA.5.29	Their roaring will be like a lioness.
ISA.5.29	They will roar like young lions.
ISA.5.29	Yes, they shall roar,
ISA.5.29	and seize their prey and carry it off,
ISA.5.29	and there will be no one to deliver.
ISA.5.30	They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.
ISA.5.30	If one looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress.
ISA.5.30	The light is darkened in its clouds.
ISA.6.1	In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple. 
ISA.6.2	Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew. 
ISA.6.3	One called to another, and said,
ISA.6.3	“Holy, holy, holy, is the 
ISA.6.3	The whole earth is full of his glory!”
ISA.6.4	The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. 
ISA.6.5	Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell amongst a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the 
ISA.6.6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. 
ISA.6.7	He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.”
ISA.6.8	I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”
ISA.6.8	Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”
ISA.6.9	He said, “Go, and tell this people,
ISA.6.9	‘You hear indeed,
ISA.6.9	but don’t understand.
ISA.6.9	You see indeed,
ISA.6.9	but don’t perceive.’
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people fat.
ISA.6.10	Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;
ISA.6.10	lest they see with their eyes,
ISA.6.10	hear with their ears,
ISA.6.10	understand with their heart,
ISA.6.10	and turn again, and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	Then I said, “Lord, how long?”
ISA.6.11	He answered,
ISA.6.11	“Until cities are waste without inhabitant,
ISA.6.11	houses without man,
ISA.6.11	the land becomes utterly waste,
ISA.6.12	and the 
ISA.6.12	and the forsaken places are many within the land.
ISA.6.13	If there is a tenth left in it,
ISA.6.13	that also will in turn be consumed,
ISA.6.13	as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stump remains when they are cut down;
ISA.6.13	so the holy seed is its stock.”
ISA.7.1	In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. 
ISA.7.2	David’s house was told, “Syria is allied with Ephraim.” His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
ISA.7.3	Then the 
ISA.7.4	Tell him, ‘Be careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. 
ISA.7.5	Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying, 
ISA.7.6	“Let’s go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it amongst ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.” 
ISA.7.7	This is what the Lord GOD says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.” 
ISA.7.8	For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people. 
ISA.7.9	The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’”
ISA.7.10	The 
ISA.7.11	“Ask a sign of the 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask. I won’t tempt the 
ISA.7.13	He said, “Listen now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God also? 
ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
ISA.7.15	He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil and choose the good. 
ISA.7.16	For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken. 
ISA.7.17	The 
ISA.7.18	It will happen in that day that the 
ISA.7.19	They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys, in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures.
ISA.7.20	In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.
ISA.7.21	It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep. 
ISA.7.22	It shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter; for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left within the land.
ISA.7.23	It will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels,
ISA.7.24	People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns. 
ISA.7.25	All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of oxen, and for sheep to tread on.”
ISA.8.1	The 
ISA.8.2	and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.”
ISA.8.3	I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then the 
ISA.8.4	For before the child knows how to say, ‘My father,’ and, ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.”
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	“Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son; 
ISA.8.7	now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River: the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks. 
ISA.8.8	It will sweep onward into Judah. It will overflow and pass through. It will reach even to the neck. The stretching out of its wings will fill the width of your land, Immanuel. 
ISA.8.9	Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be shattered! 
ISA.8.10	Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand, for God is with us.” 
ISA.8.11	For the 
ISA.8.12	“Don’t say, ‘A conspiracy!’ concerning all about which this people say, ‘A conspiracy!’ neither fear their threats, nor be terrorised. 
ISA.8.13	The 
ISA.8.14	He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a stumbling stone and a rock that makes them fall. For the people of Jerusalem, he will be a trap and a snare. 
ISA.8.15	Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured.”
ISA.8.16	Wrap up the covenant. Seal the law amongst my disciples. 
ISA.8.17	I will wait for the 
ISA.8.18	Behold, I and the children whom the 
ISA.8.19	When they tell you, “Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter,” shouldn’t a people consult with their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? 
ISA.8.20	Turn to the law and to the covenant! If they don’t speak according to this word, surely there is no morning for them. 
ISA.8.21	They will pass through it, very distressed and hungry. It will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by their God. They will turn their faces upward, 
ISA.8.22	and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into thick darkness.
ISA.9.1	But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
ISA.9.2	The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.
ISA.9.2	The light has shined on those who lived in the land of the shadow of death.
ISA.9.3	You have multiplied the nation.
ISA.9.3	You have increased their joy.
ISA.9.3	They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder. 
ISA.9.4	For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian. 
ISA.9.5	For all the armour of the armed man in the noisy battle, and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire. 
ISA.9.6	For a child is born to us. A son is given to us; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 
ISA.9.7	Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on David’s throne, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of the 
ISA.9.8	The Lord sent a word into Jacob,
ISA.9.8	and it falls on Israel.
ISA.9.9	All the people will know,
ISA.9.9	including Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,
ISA.9.10	“The bricks have fallen,
ISA.9.10	but we will build with cut stone.
ISA.9.10	The sycamore fig trees have been cut down,
ISA.9.10	but we will put cedars in their place.”
ISA.9.11	Therefore the 
ISA.9.11	and will stir up his enemies,
ISA.9.12	The Syrians in front,
ISA.9.12	and the Philistines behind;
ISA.9.12	and they will devour Israel with open mouth.
ISA.9.12	For all this, his anger is not turned away,
ISA.9.12	but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.9.13	Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them,
ISA.9.13	neither have they sought the 
ISA.9.14	Therefore the 
ISA.9.14	palm branch and reed, in one day.
ISA.9.15	The elder and the honourable man is the head,
ISA.9.15	and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail.
ISA.9.16	For those who lead this people lead them astray;
ISA.9.16	and those who are led by them are destroyed.
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,
ISA.9.17	neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows;
ISA.9.17	for everyone is profane and an evildoer,
ISA.9.17	and every mouth speaks folly.
ISA.9.17	For all this his anger is not turned away,
ISA.9.17	but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.9.18	For wickedness burns like a fire.
ISA.9.18	It devours the briers and thorns;
ISA.9.18	yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest,
ISA.9.18	and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
ISA.9.19	Through the 
ISA.9.19	and the people are the fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.19	No one spares his brother.
ISA.9.20	One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry;
ISA.9.20	and he will eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied.
ISA.9.20	Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm:
ISA.9.21	Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah.
ISA.9.21	For all this his anger is not turned away,
ISA.9.21	but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.10.1	Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers who write oppressive decrees; 
ISA.10.2	to deprive the needy of justice, and to rob the poor amongst my people of their rights, that widows may be their plunder, and that they may make the fatherless their prey! 
ISA.10.3	What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth?
ISA.10.4	They will only bow down under the prisoners,
ISA.10.4	and will fall under the slain.
ISA.10.4	For all this his anger is not turned away,
ISA.10.4	but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.10.5	Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation! 
ISA.10.6	I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people who anger me I will give him a command to take the plunder and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. 
ISA.10.7	However he doesn’t mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations. 
ISA.10.8	For he says, “Aren’t all of my princes kings? 
ISA.10.9	Isn’t Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like Damascus?” 
ISA.10.10	As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria; 
ISA.10.11	shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
ISA.10.12	Therefore it will happen that when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the wilful proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the insolence of his arrogant looks. 
ISA.10.13	For he has said, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding. I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers. 
ISA.10.14	My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, I have gathered all the earth. There was no one who moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped.”
ISA.10.15	Should an axe brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood. 
ISA.10.16	Therefore the Lord, the 
ISA.10.17	The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day. 
ISA.10.18	He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when a standard bearer faints. 
ISA.10.19	The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child could write their number.
ISA.10.20	It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on the 
ISA.10.21	A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. 
ISA.10.22	For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness. 
ISA.10.23	For the Lord, the 
ISA.10.24	Therefore the Lord, the 
ISA.10.25	For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed to his destruction.” 
ISA.10.26	The 
ISA.10.27	It will happen in that day that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.
ISA.10.28	He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage. 
ISA.10.29	They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled. 
ISA.10.30	Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor Anathoth! 
ISA.10.31	Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety. 
ISA.10.32	This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	Behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.10.34	He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
ISA.11.1	A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse,
ISA.11.1	and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit.
ISA.11.2	The 
ISA.11.2	the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
ISA.11.2	the spirit of counsel and might,
ISA.11.2	the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the 
ISA.11.3	His delight will be in the fear of the 
ISA.11.3	He will not judge by the sight of his eyes,
ISA.11.3	neither decide by the hearing of his ears;
ISA.11.4	but he will judge the poor with righteousness,
ISA.11.4	and decide with equity for the humble of the earth.
ISA.11.4	He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth;
ISA.11.4	and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.
ISA.11.5	Righteousness will be the belt of his waist,
ISA.11.5	and faithfulness the belt of his waist.
ISA.11.6	The wolf will live with the lamb,
ISA.11.6	and the leopard will lie down with the young goat,
ISA.11.6	the calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together;
ISA.11.6	and a little child will lead them.
ISA.11.7	The cow and the bear will graze.
ISA.11.7	Their young ones will lie down together.
ISA.11.7	The lion will eat straw like the ox.
ISA.11.8	The nursing child will play near a cobra’s hole,
ISA.11.8	and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper’s den.
ISA.11.9	They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain;
ISA.11.9	for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the 
ISA.11.9	as the waters cover the sea.
ISA.11.10	It will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be glorious.
ISA.11.11	It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 
ISA.11.12	He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. 
ISA.11.13	The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute Judah will be cut off. Ephraim won’t envy Judah, and Judah won’t persecute Ephraim. 
ISA.11.14	They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west. Together they will plunder the children of the east. They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the children of Ammon will obey them. 
ISA.11.15	The 
ISA.11.16	There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	In that day you will say, “I will give thanks to you, the 
ISA.12.2	Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for the 
ISA.12.3	Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation. 
ISA.12.4	In that day you will say, “Give thanks to the 
ISA.12.5	Sing to the 
ISA.12.6	Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One of Israel is great amongst you!”
ISA.13.1	The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.
ISA.13.2	Set up a banner on the bare mountain! Lift up your voice to them! Wave your hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. 
ISA.13.3	I have commanded my consecrated ones; yes, I have called my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly exulting ones. 
ISA.13.4	The noise of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people; the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! The 
ISA.13.5	They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even the 
ISA.13.6	Wail, for the 
ISA.13.7	Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone’s heart will melt. 
ISA.13.8	They will be dismayed. Pangs and sorrows will seize them. They will be in pain like a woman in labour. They will look in amazement one at another. Their faces will be faces of flame. 
ISA.13.9	Behold, the day of the 
ISA.13.10	For the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light. The sun will be darkened in its going out, and the moon will not cause its light to shine. 
ISA.13.11	I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will humble the arrogance of the terrible. 
ISA.13.12	I will make people more rare than fine gold, even a person than the pure gold of Ophir. 
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place in the 
ISA.13.14	It will happen that like a hunted gazelle, and like sheep that no one gathers, they will each turn to their own people, and will each flee to their own land. 
ISA.13.15	Everyone who is found will be thrust through. Everyone who is captured will fall by the sword. 
ISA.13.16	Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be ransacked, and their wives raped.
ISA.13.17	Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not value silver, and as for gold, they will not delight in it. 
ISA.13.18	Their bows will dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb. Their eyes will not spare children. 
ISA.13.19	Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans’ pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 
ISA.13.20	It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from generation to generation. The Arabian will not pitch a tent there, neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there. 
ISA.13.21	But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their houses will be full of jackals. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there. 
ISA.13.22	Wolves will cry in their fortresses, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come, and her days will not be prolonged.
ISA.14.1	For the 
ISA.14.2	The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place. The house of Israel will possess them in the 
ISA.14.3	It will happen in the day that the 
ISA.14.4	that you will take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, “How the oppressor has ceased! The golden city has ceased!” 
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.6	who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that no one restrained. 
ISA.14.7	The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet. They break out in song. 
ISA.14.8	Yes, the cypress trees rejoice with you, with the cedars of Lebanon, saying, “Since you are humbled, no lumberjack has come up against us.” 
ISA.14.9	Sheol
ISA.14.10	They all will answer and ask you, “Have you also become as weak as we are? Have you become like us?” 
ISA.14.11	Your pomp is brought down to Sheol,
ISA.14.12	How you have fallen from heaven, shining one, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low! 
ISA.14.13	You said in your heart, “I will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God! I will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north! 
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds! I will make myself like the Most High!” 
ISA.14.15	Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol,
ISA.14.16	Those who see you will stare at you. They will ponder you, saying, “Is this the man who made the earth to tremble, who shook kingdoms, 
ISA.14.17	who made the world like a wilderness, and overthrew its cities, who didn’t release his prisoners to their home?”
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations sleep in glory, everyone in his own house. 
ISA.14.19	But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead body trodden under foot. 
ISA.14.20	You will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed your land. You have killed your people. The offspring of evildoers will not be named forever.
ISA.14.21	Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their fathers, that they not rise up and possess the earth, and fill the surface of the world with cities. 
ISA.14.22	“I will rise up against them,” says the 
ISA.14.23	“I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water. I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” says the 
ISA.14.24	The 
ISA.14.25	that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him under foot on my mountains. Then his yoke will leave them, and his burden leave their shoulders. 
ISA.14.26	This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth. This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations. 
ISA.14.27	For the 
ISA.14.28	This burden was in the year that king Ahaz died.
ISA.14.29	Don’t rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that struck you is broken; for out of the serpent’s root an adder will emerge, and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent. 
ISA.14.30	The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant will be killed.
ISA.14.31	Howl, gate! Cry, city! You are melted away, Philistia, all of you; for smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.
ISA.14.32	What will they answer the messengers of the nation? That the 
ISA.15.1	The burden of Moab.
ISA.15.1	For in a night, Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing. For in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing. 
ISA.15.2	They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba. Baldness is on all of their heads. Every beard is cut off. 
ISA.15.3	In their streets, they clothe themselves in sackcloth. In their streets and on their housetops, everyone wails, weeping abundantly. 
ISA.15.4	Heshbon cries out with Elealeh. Their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud. Their souls tremble within them. 
ISA.15.5	My heart cries out for Moab! Her nobles flee to Zoar, to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping; for on the way to Horonaim, they raise up a cry of destruction. 
ISA.15.6	For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing. 
ISA.15.7	Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have stored up, over the brook of the willows. 
ISA.15.8	For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab, its wailing to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim. 
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more on Dimon, a lion on those of Moab who escape, and on the remnant of the land.
ISA.16.1	Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, to the mountain of the daughter of Zion. 
ISA.16.2	For it will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon. 
ISA.16.3	Give counsel! Execute justice! Make your shade like the night in the middle of the noonday! Hide the outcasts! Don’t betray the fugitive! 
ISA.16.4	Let my outcasts dwell with you! As for Moab, be a hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortionist is brought to nothing. Destruction ceases. The oppressors are consumed out of the land. 
ISA.16.5	A throne will be established in loving kindness. One will sit on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging, seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; even of his arrogance, his pride, and his wrath. His boastings are nothing. 
ISA.16.7	Therefore Moab will wail for Moab. Everyone will wail. You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth, utterly stricken. 
ISA.16.8	For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad. They passed over the sea. 
ISA.16.9	Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen. 
ISA.16.10	Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there will be no singing, neither joyful noise. Nobody will tread out wine in the presses. I have made the shouting stop. 
ISA.16.11	Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir Heres. 
ISA.16.12	It will happen that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, and comes to his sanctuary to pray, that he will not prevail.
ISA.16.13	This is the word that the 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	The burden of Damascus.
ISA.17.1	“Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap. 
ISA.17.2	The cities of Aroer are forsaken. They will be for flocks, which shall lie down, and no one shall make them afraid. 
ISA.17.3	The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria. They will be as the glory of the children of Israel,” says the 
ISA.17.4	“It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh will become lean. 
ISA.17.5	It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his arm reaps the grain. Yes, it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim. 
ISA.17.6	Yet gleanings will be left there, like the shaking of an olive tree, two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree,” says the 
ISA.17.7	In that day, people will look to their Maker, and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel. 
ISA.17.8	They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made, either the Asherah poles, or the incense altars. 
ISA.17.9	In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel; and it will be a desolation. 
ISA.17.10	For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not remembered the rock of your strength. Therefore you plant pleasant plants, and set out foreign seedlings. 
ISA.17.11	In the day of your planting, you hedge it in. In the morning, you make your seed blossom, but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
ISA.17.12	Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters! 
ISA.17.13	The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters: but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far off, and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm. 
ISA.17.14	At evening, behold, terror! Before the morning, they are no more. This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us.
ISA.18.1	Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia; 
ISA.18.2	that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus on the waters, saying, “Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide!” 
ISA.18.3	All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth, when a banner is lifted up on the mountains, look! When the trumpet is blown, listen!
ISA.18.4	For the 
ISA.18.5	For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches. 
ISA.18.6	They will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains, and for the animals of the earth. The ravenous birds will eat them in the summer, and all the animals of the earth will eat them in the winter. 
ISA.18.7	In that time, a present will be brought to the 
ISA.19.1	The burden of Egypt.
ISA.19.1	“Behold, the 
ISA.19.2	I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom. 
ISA.19.3	The spirit of the Egyptians will fail within them. I will destroy their counsel. They will seek the idols, the charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards. 
ISA.19.4	I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them,” says the Lord, the 
ISA.19.5	The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry. 
ISA.19.6	The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away. 
ISA.19.7	The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more. 
ISA.19.8	The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish. 
ISA.19.9	Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded. 
ISA.19.10	The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul.
ISA.19.11	The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?” 
ISA.19.12	Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what the 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, who are the cornerstone of her tribes. 
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.15	Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do. 
ISA.19.16	In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the 
ISA.19.17	The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of the 
ISA.19.18	In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the 
ISA.19.19	In that day, there will be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	It will be for a sign and for a witness to the 
ISA.19.21	The 
ISA.19.22	The 
ISA.19.23	In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
ISA.19.24	In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing within the earth; 
ISA.19.25	because the 
ISA.20.1	In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it; 
ISA.20.2	at that time the 
ISA.20.3	The 
ISA.20.4	so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
ISA.20.5	They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory. 
ISA.20.6	The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, ‘Behold, this is our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria. And we, how will we escape?’”
ISA.21.1	The burden of the wilderness of the sea.
ISA.21.1	As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land. 
ISA.21.2	A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media’s sighing. 
ISA.21.3	Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have seized me, like the pains of a woman in labour. I am in so much pain that I can’t hear. I am so dismayed that I can’t see. 
ISA.21.4	My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me. 
ISA.21.5	They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield! 
ISA.21.6	For the Lord said to me, “Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees. 
ISA.21.7	When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.” 
ISA.21.8	He cried like a lion: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post. 
ISA.21.9	Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.
ISA.21.10	You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!” That which I have heard from the 
ISA.21.11	The burden of Dumah.
ISA.21.11	One calls to me out of Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?” 
ISA.21.12	The watchman said, “The morning comes, and also the night. If you will enquire, enquire. Come back again.”
ISA.21.13	The burden on Arabia.
ISA.21.13	In the forest in Arabia you will lodge, you caravans of Dedanites. 
ISA.21.14	They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread. 
ISA.21.15	For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle. 
ISA.21.16	For the Lord said to me, “Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail, 
ISA.21.17	and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for the 
ISA.22.1	The burden of the valley of vision.
ISA.22.1	What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops? 
ISA.22.2	You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle. 
ISA.22.3	All your rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away. 
ISA.22.4	Therefore I said, “Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don’t labour to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
ISA.22.5	For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, the 
ISA.22.6	Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield. 
ISA.22.7	Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate. 
ISA.22.8	He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armour in the house of the forest. 
ISA.22.9	You saw the breaches of David’s city, that they were many; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool. 
ISA.22.10	You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. 
ISA.22.11	You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn’t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who planned it long ago.
ISA.22.12	In that day, the Lord, the 
ISA.22.13	and behold, joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: “Let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.” 
ISA.22.14	The 
ISA.22.15	The Lord, the 
ISA.22.16	‘What are you doing here? Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?’ Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiselling a habitation for himself in the rock!” 
ISA.22.17	Behold, the 
ISA.22.18	He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you disgrace of your lord’s house. 
ISA.22.19	I will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your station.
ISA.22.20	It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, 
ISA.22.21	and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. 
ISA.22.22	I will lay the key of David’s house on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open. 
ISA.22.23	I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father’s house. 
ISA.22.24	They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers. 
ISA.22.25	“In that day,” says the 
ISA.23.1	The burden of Tyre.
ISA.23.1	Howl, you ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them. 
ISA.23.2	Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants of Sidon that pass over the sea have replenished. 
ISA.23.3	On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue. She was the market of nations. 
ISA.23.4	Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not travailed, nor given birth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.” 
ISA.23.5	When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre. 
ISA.23.6	Pass over to Tarshish! Wail, you inhabitants of the coast! 
ISA.23.7	Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her far away to travel?
ISA.23.8	Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the honourable of the earth? 
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.10	Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish. There is no restraint any more. 
ISA.23.11	He has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms. The 
ISA.23.12	He said, “You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim. Even there you will have no rest.”
ISA.23.13	Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people didn’t exist. The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin. 
ISA.23.14	Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste! 
ISA.23.15	It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute. 
ISA.23.16	Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered. 
ISA.23.17	It will happen after the end of seventy years that the 
ISA.23.18	Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to the 
ISA.24.1	Behold, the 
ISA.24.2	It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest. 
ISA.24.3	The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for the 
ISA.24.4	The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish. 
ISA.24.5	The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant. 
ISA.24.6	Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burnt, and few men are left. 
ISA.24.7	The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh. 
ISA.24.8	The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases. 
ISA.24.9	They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it. 
ISA.24.10	The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in. 
ISA.24.11	There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone. 
ISA.24.12	The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction. 
ISA.24.13	For it will be so within the earth amongst the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.
ISA.24.14	These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of the 
ISA.24.15	Therefore glorify the 
ISA.24.16	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous!
ISA.24.16	But I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously. 
ISA.24.17	Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabit the earth. 
ISA.24.18	It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble. 
ISA.24.19	The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently. 
ISA.24.20	The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.
ISA.24.21	It will happen in that day that the 
ISA.24.22	They will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and will be shut up in the prison; and after many days they will be visited. 
ISA.24.23	Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the 
ISA.25.1	The 
ISA.25.2	For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city. It will never be built. 
ISA.25.3	Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you. 
ISA.25.4	For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall. 
ISA.25.5	As the heat in a dry place you will bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low.
ISA.25.6	In this mountain, the 
ISA.25.7	He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations. 
ISA.25.8	He has swallowed up death forever! The Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces. He will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth, for the 
ISA.25.9	It shall be said in that day, “Behold, this is our God! We have waited for him, and he will save us! This is the 
ISA.25.10	For the 
ISA.25.10	Moab will be trodden down in his place, even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill. 
ISA.25.11	He will spread out his hands in the middle of it, like one who swims spreads out hands to swim, but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands. 
ISA.25.12	He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.
ISA.26.1	In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
ISA.26.1	“We have a strong city.
ISA.26.1	God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.
ISA.26.2	Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter:
ISA.26.2	the one which keeps faith.
ISA.26.3	You will keep whoever’s mind is steadfast in perfect peace,
ISA.26.3	because he trusts in you.
ISA.26.4	Trust in the 
ISA.26.4	for in the 
ISA.26.5	For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.
ISA.26.5	He lays it low.
ISA.26.5	He lays it low even to the ground.
ISA.26.5	He brings it even to the dust.
ISA.26.6	The foot shall tread it down,
ISA.26.6	even the feet of the poor
ISA.26.6	and the steps of the needy.”
ISA.26.7	The way of the just is uprightness.
ISA.26.7	You who are upright make the path of the righteous level.
ISA.26.8	Yes, in the way of your judgements, the 
ISA.26.8	Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.
ISA.26.9	With my soul I have desired you in the night.
ISA.26.9	Yes, with my spirit within me I will seek you earnestly;
ISA.26.9	for when your judgements are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	Let favour be shown to the wicked,
ISA.26.10	yet he will not learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully,
ISA.26.10	and will not see the 
ISA.26.11	The 
ISA.26.11	but they will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed.
ISA.26.11	Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.
ISA.26.12	The 
ISA.26.12	for you have also done all our work for us.
ISA.26.13	The 
ISA.26.13	but we will only acknowledge your name.
ISA.26.14	The dead shall not live.
ISA.26.14	The departed spirits shall not rise.
ISA.26.14	Therefore you have visited and destroyed them,
ISA.26.14	and caused all memory of them to perish.
ISA.26.15	You have increased the nation, O 
ISA.26.15	You have increased the nation!
ISA.26.15	You are glorified!
ISA.26.15	You have enlarged all the borders of the land.
ISA.26.16	, in trouble they have visited you.
ISA.26.16	They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.
ISA.26.17	Just as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery,
ISA.26.17	is in pain and cries out in her pangs,
ISA.26.17	so we have been before you, 
ISA.26.18	We have been with child.
ISA.26.18	We have been in pain.
ISA.26.18	We gave birth, it seems, only to wind.
ISA.26.18	We have not worked any deliverance in the earth;
ISA.26.18	neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
ISA.26.19	Your dead shall live.
ISA.26.19	My dead bodies shall arise.
ISA.26.19	Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust;
ISA.26.19	for your dew is like the dew of herbs,
ISA.26.19	and the earth will cast out the departed spirits.
ISA.26.20	Come, my people, enter into your rooms,
ISA.26.20	and shut your doors behind you.
ISA.26.20	Hide yourself for a little moment,
ISA.26.20	until the indignation is past.
ISA.26.21	For, behold, the 
ISA.26.21	The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover her slain.
ISA.27.1	In that day, the 
ISA.27.2	In that day, sing to her, “A pleasant vineyard! 
ISA.27.3	I, the 
ISA.27.4	Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together. 
ISA.27.5	Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.”
ISA.27.6	In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit. 
ISA.27.7	Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed? 
ISA.27.8	In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind. 
ISA.27.9	Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more. 
ISA.27.10	For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches. 
ISA.27.11	When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favour.
ISA.27.12	It will happen in that day that the 
ISA.27.13	It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship the 
ISA.28.1	Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine! 
ISA.28.2	Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one. Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down to the earth with his hand. 
ISA.28.3	The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot. 
ISA.28.4	The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it. 
ISA.28.5	In that day, the 
ISA.28.6	and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgement, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
ISA.28.7	They also reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink. They are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with strong drink. They err in vision. They stumble in judgement. 
ISA.28.8	For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness.
ISA.28.9	Whom will he teach knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts? 
ISA.28.10	For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little.
ISA.28.11	But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language, 
ISA.28.12	to whom he said, “This is the resting place. Give rest to the weary,” and “This is the refreshing;” yet they would not hear. 
ISA.28.13	Therefore the 
ISA.28.14	Therefore hear the 
ISA.28.15	“Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant with death, and we are in agreement with Sheol.
ISA.28.16	Therefore the Lord GOD says, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes shall not act hastily. 
ISA.28.17	I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place. 
ISA.28.18	Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol
ISA.28.19	As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.” 
ISA.28.20	For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in. 
ISA.28.21	For the 
ISA.28.22	Now therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, the 
ISA.28.23	Give ear, and hear my voice! Listen, and hear my speech! 
ISA.28.24	Does he who ploughs to sow plough continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods? 
ISA.28.25	When he has levelled its surface, doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place? 
ISA.28.26	For his God instructs him in right judgement and teaches him. 
ISA.28.27	For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod. 
ISA.28.28	Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it. Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it, his horses don’t grind it. 
ISA.28.29	This also comes out from the 
ISA.29.1	Woe to Ariel! Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts come around; 
ISA.29.2	then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be to me as an altar hearth.
ISA.29.3	I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will raise siege works against you. 
ISA.29.4	You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.
ISA.29.5	But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly. 
ISA.29.6	She will be visited by the 
ISA.29.7	The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night. 
ISA.29.8	It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn’t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that.
ISA.29.9	Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. 
ISA.29.10	For the 
ISA.29.11	All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t, for it is sealed;” 
ISA.29.12	and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t read.”
ISA.29.13	The Lord said, “Because this people draws near with their mouth and honours me with their lips, but they have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught; 
ISA.29.14	therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work amongst this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.”
ISA.29.15	Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from the 
ISA.29.16	You turn things upside down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay; that the thing made should say about him who made it, “He didn’t make me;” or the thing formed say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding?”
ISA.29.17	Isn’t it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest? 
ISA.29.18	In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness. 
ISA.29.19	The humble also will increase their joy in the 
ISA.29.20	For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off— 
ISA.29.21	who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare for one who reproves in the gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.
ISA.29.22	Therefore the 
ISA.29.23	But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of him, they will sanctify my name. Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel. 
ISA.29.24	They also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will receive instruction.”
ISA.30.1	“Woe to the rebellious children”, says the 
ISA.30.2	who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my advice, to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt! 
ISA.30.3	Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. 
ISA.30.4	For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes. 
ISA.30.5	They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can’t profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.”
ISA.30.6	The burden of the animals of the South.
ISA.30.6	Through the land of trouble and anguish, of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to an unprofitable people. 
ISA.30.7	For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still. 
ISA.30.8	Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever. 
ISA.30.9	For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear the 
ISA.30.10	who tell the seers, “Don’t see!” and the prophets, “Don’t prophesy to us right things. Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy deceits. 
ISA.30.11	Get out of the way. Turn away from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.” 
ISA.30.12	Therefore the Holy One of Israel says, “Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it, 
ISA.30.13	therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant. 
ISA.30.14	He will break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there won’t be found amongst the broken pieces a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.”
ISA.30.15	For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, “You will be saved in returning and rest. Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.” You refused, 
ISA.30.16	but you said, “No, for we will flee on horses;” therefore you will flee; and, “We will ride on the swift;” therefore those who pursue you will be swift. 
ISA.30.17	One thousand will flee at the threat of one. At the threat of five, you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.
ISA.30.18	Therefore the 
ISA.30.19	For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. You will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When he hears you, he will answer you. 
ISA.30.20	Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers won’t be hidden any more, but your eyes will see your teachers; 
ISA.30.21	and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way. Walk in it.” 
ISA.30.22	You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as an unclean thing. You shall tell it, “Go away!”
ISA.30.23	He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that day, your livestock will feed in large pastures. 
ISA.30.24	The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savoury feed, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork. 
ISA.30.25	There will be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. 
ISA.30.26	Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, in the day that the 
ISA.30.27	Behold, the 
ISA.30.28	His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. A bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples. 
ISA.30.29	You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come to the 
ISA.30.30	The 
ISA.30.31	For through the 
ISA.30.32	Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which the 
ISA.30.33	For his burning place has long been ready. Yes, it is prepared for the king. He has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. The 
ISA.31.1	Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,
ISA.31.1	and rely on horses,
ISA.31.1	and trust in chariots because they are many,
ISA.31.1	and in horsemen because they are very strong,
ISA.31.1	but they don’t look to the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.31.1	and they don’t seek the 
ISA.31.2	Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster,
ISA.31.2	and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers,
ISA.31.2	and against the help of those who work iniquity.
ISA.31.3	Now the Egyptians are men, and not God;
ISA.31.3	and their horses flesh, and not spirit.
ISA.31.3	When the 
ISA.31.3	and he who is helped shall fall,
ISA.31.3	and they all shall be consumed together.
ISA.31.4	For the 
ISA.31.4	“As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey,
ISA.31.4	if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him,
ISA.31.4	will not be dismayed at their voice,
ISA.31.4	nor abase himself for their noise,
ISA.31.4	so the 
ISA.31.5	As birds hovering, so the 
ISA.31.5	He will protect and deliver it.
ISA.31.5	He will pass over and preserve it.”
ISA.31.6	Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel. 
ISA.31.7	For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold—sin which your own hands have made for you.
ISA.31.8	“The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man;
ISA.31.8	and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him.
ISA.31.8	He will flee from the sword,
ISA.31.8	and his young men will become subject to forced labour.
ISA.31.9	His rock will pass away by reason of terror,
ISA.31.9	and his princes will be afraid of the banner,”
ISA.31.9	says the 
ISA.31.9	and his furnace in Jerusalem.
ISA.32.1	Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness,
ISA.32.1	and princes shall rule in justice.
ISA.32.2	A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind,
ISA.32.2	and a covert from the storm,
ISA.32.2	as streams of water in a dry place,
ISA.32.2	as the shade of a large rock in a weary land.
ISA.32.3	The eyes of those who see will not be dim,
ISA.32.3	and the ears of those who hear will listen.
ISA.32.4	The heart of the rash will understand knowledge,
ISA.32.4	and the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly.
ISA.32.5	The fool will no longer be called noble,
ISA.32.5	nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
ISA.32.6	For the fool will speak folly,
ISA.32.6	and his heart will work iniquity,
ISA.32.6	to practise profanity,
ISA.32.6	and to utter error against the 
ISA.32.6	to make empty the soul of the hungry,
ISA.32.6	and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
ISA.32.7	The ways of the scoundrel are evil.
ISA.32.7	He devises wicked plans to destroy the humble with lying words,
ISA.32.7	even when the needy speaks right.
ISA.32.8	But the noble devises noble things;
ISA.32.8	and he will continue in noble things.
ISA.32.9	Rise up, you women who are at ease! Hear my voice!
ISA.32.9	You careless daughters, give ear to my speech!
ISA.32.10	For days beyond a year you will be troubled, you careless women;
ISA.32.10	for the vintage will fail.
ISA.32.10	The harvest won’t come.
ISA.32.11	Tremble, you women who are at ease!
ISA.32.11	Be troubled, you careless ones!
ISA.32.11	Strip yourselves, make yourselves naked,
ISA.32.11	and put sackcloth on your waist.
ISA.32.12	Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,
ISA.32.12	for the fruitful vine.
ISA.32.13	Thorns and briers will come up on my people’s land;
ISA.32.13	yes, on all the houses of joy in the joyous city.
ISA.32.14	For the palace will be forsaken.
ISA.32.14	The populous city will be deserted.
ISA.32.14	The hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever,
ISA.32.14	a delight for wild donkeys,
ISA.32.14	a pasture of flocks,
ISA.32.15	until the Spirit is poured on us from on high,
ISA.32.15	and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,
ISA.32.15	and the fruitful field is considered a forest.
ISA.32.16	Then justice will dwell in the wilderness;
ISA.32.16	and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field.
ISA.32.17	The work of righteousness will be peace,
ISA.32.17	and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.
ISA.32.18	My people will live in a peaceful habitation,
ISA.32.18	in safe dwellings,
ISA.32.18	and in quiet resting places,
ISA.32.19	though hail flattens the forest,
ISA.32.19	and the city is levelled completely.
ISA.32.20	Blessed are you who sow beside all waters,
ISA.32.20	who send out the feet of the ox and the donkey.
ISA.33.1	Woe to you who destroy, but you weren’t destroyed,
ISA.33.1	and who betray, but nobody betrayed you!
ISA.33.1	When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed;
ISA.33.1	and when you have finished betrayal, you will be betrayed.
ISA.33.2	, be gracious to us. We have waited for you.
ISA.33.2	Be our strength every morning,
ISA.33.2	our salvation also in the time of trouble.
ISA.33.3	At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled.
ISA.33.3	When you lift yourself up, the nations are scattered.
ISA.33.4	Your plunder will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers.
ISA.33.4	Men will leap on it as locusts leap.
ISA.33.5	The 
ISA.33.5	He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
ISA.33.6	There will be stability in your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge.
ISA.33.6	The fear of the 
ISA.33.7	Behold, their valiant ones cry outside;
ISA.33.7	the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
ISA.33.8	The highways are desolate.
ISA.33.8	The travelling man ceases.
ISA.33.8	The covenant is broken.
ISA.33.8	He has despised the cities.
ISA.33.8	He doesn’t respect man.
ISA.33.9	The land mourns and languishes.
ISA.33.9	Lebanon is confounded and withers away.
ISA.33.9	Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.
ISA.33.10	“Now I will arise,” says the 
ISA.33.10	“Now I will lift myself up.
ISA.33.10	Now I will be exalted.
ISA.33.11	You will conceive chaff.
ISA.33.11	You will give birth to stubble.
ISA.33.11	Your breath is a fire that will devour you.
ISA.33.12	The peoples will be like the burning of lime,
ISA.33.12	like thorns that are cut down and burnt in the fire.
ISA.33.13	Hear, you who are far off, what I have done;
ISA.33.13	and, you who are near, acknowledge my might.”
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Zion are afraid.
ISA.33.14	Trembling has seized the godless ones.
ISA.33.14	Who amongst us can live with the devouring fire?
ISA.33.14	Who amongst us can live with everlasting burning?
ISA.33.15	He who walks righteously
ISA.33.15	and speaks blamelessly,
ISA.33.15	he who despises the gain of oppressions,
ISA.33.15	who gestures with his hands, refusing to take a bribe,
ISA.33.15	who stops his ears from hearing of blood,
ISA.33.15	and shuts his eyes from looking at evil—
ISA.33.16	he will dwell on high.
ISA.33.16	His place of defence will be the fortress of rocks.
ISA.33.16	His bread will be supplied.
ISA.33.16	His waters will be sure.
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see the king in his beauty.
ISA.33.17	They will see a distant land.
ISA.33.18	Your heart will meditate on the terror.
ISA.33.18	Where is he who counted?
ISA.33.18	Where is he who weighed?
ISA.33.18	Where is he who counted the towers?
ISA.33.19	You will no longer see the fierce people,
ISA.33.19	a people of a deep speech that you can’t comprehend,
ISA.33.19	with a strange language that you can’t understand.
ISA.33.20	Look at Zion, the city of our appointed festivals.
ISA.33.20	Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation,
ISA.33.20	a tent that won’t be removed.
ISA.33.20	Its stakes will never be plucked up,
ISA.33.20	nor will any of its cords be broken.
ISA.33.21	But there the 
ISA.33.21	a place of wide rivers and streams,
ISA.33.21	in which no galley with oars will go,
ISA.33.21	neither will any gallant ship pass by there.
ISA.33.22	For the 
ISA.33.22	The 
ISA.33.22	The 
ISA.33.22	He will save us.
ISA.33.23	Your rigging is untied.
ISA.33.23	They couldn’t strengthen the foot of their mast.
ISA.33.23	They couldn’t spread the sail.
ISA.33.23	Then the prey of a great plunder was divided.
ISA.33.23	The lame took the prey.
ISA.33.24	The inhabitant won’t say, “I am sick.”
ISA.33.24	The people who dwell therein will be forgiven their iniquity.
ISA.34.1	Come near, you nations, to hear!
ISA.34.1	Listen, you peoples.
ISA.34.1	Let the earth and all it contains hear,
ISA.34.1	the world, and everything that comes from it.
ISA.34.2	For the 
ISA.34.2	and angry with all their armies.
ISA.34.2	He has utterly destroyed them.
ISA.34.2	He has given them over for slaughter.
ISA.34.3	Their slain will also be cast out,
ISA.34.3	and the stench of their dead bodies will come up.
ISA.34.3	The mountains will melt in their blood.
ISA.34.4	All of the army of the sky will be dissolved.
ISA.34.4	The sky will be rolled up like a scroll,
ISA.34.4	and all its armies will fade away,
ISA.34.4	as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree.
ISA.34.5	For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky.
ISA.34.5	Behold, it will come down on Edom,
ISA.34.5	and on the people of my curse, for judgement.
ISA.34.6	The 
ISA.34.6	It is covered with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats,
ISA.34.6	with the fat of the kidneys of rams;
ISA.34.6	for the 
ISA.34.6	And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
ISA.34.7	The wild oxen will come down with them,
ISA.34.7	and the young bulls with the mighty bulls;
ISA.34.7	and their land will be drunken with blood,
ISA.34.7	and their dust made greasy with fat.
ISA.34.8	For the 
ISA.34.8	a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
ISA.34.9	Its streams will be turned into pitch,
ISA.34.9	its dust into sulphur,
ISA.34.9	And its land will become burning pitch.
ISA.34.10	It won’t be quenched night or day.
ISA.34.10	Its smoke will go up forever.
ISA.34.10	From generation to generation, it will lie waste.
ISA.34.10	No one will pass through it forever and ever.
ISA.34.11	But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it.
ISA.34.11	The owl and the raven will dwell in it.
ISA.34.11	He will stretch the line of confusion over it,
ISA.34.11	and the plumb line of emptiness.
ISA.34.12	They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there;
ISA.34.12	and all its princes shall be nothing.
ISA.34.13	Thorns will come up in its palaces,
ISA.34.13	nettles and thistles in its fortresses;
ISA.34.13	and it will be a habitation of jackals,
ISA.34.13	a court for ostriches.
ISA.34.14	The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves,
ISA.34.14	and the wild goat will cry to his fellow.
ISA.34.14	Yes, the night creature
ISA.34.14	and shall find herself a place of rest.
ISA.34.15	The arrow snake will make her nest there,
ISA.34.15	and lay, hatch, and gather under her shade.
ISA.34.15	Yes, the kites will be gathered there, every one with her mate.
ISA.34.16	Search in the book of the 
ISA.34.16	not one of these will be missing.
ISA.34.16	None will lack her mate.
ISA.34.16	For my mouth has commanded,
ISA.34.16	and his Spirit has gathered them.
ISA.34.17	He has cast the lot for them,
ISA.34.17	and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line.
ISA.34.17	They shall possess it forever.
ISA.34.17	From generation to generation they will dwell in it.
ISA.35.1	The wilderness and the dry land will be glad.
ISA.35.1	The desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose.
ISA.35.2	It will blossom abundantly,
ISA.35.2	and rejoice even with joy and singing.
ISA.35.2	Lebanon’s glory will be given to it,
ISA.35.2	the excellence of Carmel and Sharon.
ISA.35.2	They will see the 
ISA.35.2	the excellence of our God.
ISA.35.3	Strengthen the weak hands,
ISA.35.3	and make the feeble knees firm.
ISA.35.4	Tell those who have a fearful heart, “Be strong!
ISA.35.4	Don’t be afraid!
ISA.35.4	Behold, your God will come with vengeance, God’s retribution.
ISA.35.4	He will come and save you.
ISA.35.5	Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,
ISA.35.5	and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.
ISA.35.6	Then the lame man will leap like a deer,
ISA.35.6	and the tongue of the mute will sing;
ISA.35.6	for waters will break out in the wilderness,
ISA.35.6	and streams in the desert.
ISA.35.7	The burning sand will become a pool,
ISA.35.7	and the thirsty ground springs of water.
ISA.35.7	Grass with reeds and rushes will be in the habitation of jackals, where they lay.
ISA.35.8	A highway will be there, a road,
ISA.35.8	and it will be called “The Holy Way”.
ISA.35.8	The unclean shall not pass over it,
ISA.35.8	but it will be for those who walk in the Way.
ISA.35.8	Wicked fools shall not go there.
ISA.35.9	No lion will be there,
ISA.35.9	nor will any ravenous animal go up on it.
ISA.35.9	They will not be found there;
ISA.35.9	but the redeemed will walk there.
ISA.35.10	Then the 
ISA.35.10	and come with singing to Zion;
ISA.35.10	and everlasting joy will be on their heads.
ISA.35.10	They will obtain gladness and joy,
ISA.35.10	and sorrow and sighing will flee away.”
ISA.36.1	Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
ISA.36.2	The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army. He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller’s field highway. 
ISA.36.3	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder came out to him.
ISA.36.4	Rabshakeh said to them, “Now tell Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says, “What confidence is this in which you trust? 
ISA.36.5	I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? 
ISA.36.6	Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. 
ISA.36.7	But if you tell me, ‘We trust in the 
ISA.36.8	Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. 
ISA.36.9	How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
ISA.36.10	Have I come up now without the 
ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak to us in the Jews’ language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”
ISA.36.12	But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?” 
ISA.36.13	Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! 
ISA.36.14	The king says, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you. 
ISA.36.15	Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
ISA.36.16	Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern; 
ISA.36.17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
ISA.36.18	Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “The 
ISA.36.19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? 
ISA.36.20	Who are they amongst all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the 
ISA.36.21	But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.”
ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
ISA.37.1	When king Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the 
ISA.37.2	He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 
ISA.37.3	They said to him, “Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to give birth. 
ISA.37.4	It may be the 
ISA.37.5	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
ISA.37.6	Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘The 
ISA.37.7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”
ISA.37.8	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish. 
ISA.37.9	He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
ISA.37.10	“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” 
ISA.37.11	Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered? 
ISA.37.12	Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar? 
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’”
ISA.37.14	Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the 
ISA.37.15	Hezekiah prayed to the 
ISA.37.16	“
ISA.37.17	Turn your ear, 
ISA.37.18	Truly, 
ISA.37.19	and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. 
ISA.37.20	Now therefore, 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “The 
ISA.37.22	this is the word which the 
ISA.37.23	Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel. 
ISA.37.24	By your servants, you have defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees. I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field. 
ISA.37.25	I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.”
ISA.37.26	“‘Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it in ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning them into ruinous heaps. 
ISA.37.27	Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like a field before its crop has grown. 
ISA.37.28	But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me. 
ISA.37.29	Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.
ISA.37.30	“‘This shall be the sign to you. You will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from it; and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 
ISA.37.31	The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. 
ISA.37.32	For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and survivors will escape from Mount Zion. The zeal of the 
ISA.37.33	“Therefore the 
ISA.37.34	He will return the way that he came, and he won’t come to this city,’ says the 
ISA.37.35	‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.’”
ISA.37.36	Then the 
ISA.37.37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away, returned to Nineveh, and stayed there. 
ISA.37.38	As he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.
ISA.38.1	In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, “The 
ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the 
ISA.38.3	and said, “Remember now, the 
ISA.38.4	Then the 
ISA.38.5	“Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘The 
ISA.38.6	I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city. 
ISA.38.7	This shall be the sign to you from the 
ISA.38.8	Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.”’” So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down.
ISA.38.9	The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness.
ISA.38.10	I said, “In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.
ISA.38.10	I am deprived of the residue of my years.”
ISA.38.11	I said, “I won’t see the 
ISA.38.11	The 
ISA.38.11	I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
ISA.38.12	My dwelling is removed,
ISA.38.12	and is carried away from me like a shepherd’s tent.
ISA.38.12	I have rolled up my life like a weaver.
ISA.38.12	He will cut me off from the loom.
ISA.38.12	From day even to night you will make an end of me.
ISA.38.13	I waited patiently until morning.
ISA.38.13	He breaks all my bones like a lion.
ISA.38.13	From day even to night you will make an end of me.
ISA.38.14	I chattered like a swallow or a crane.
ISA.38.14	I moaned like a dove.
ISA.38.14	My eyes weaken looking upward.
ISA.38.14	Lord, I am oppressed.
ISA.38.14	Be my security.”
ISA.38.15	What will I say?
ISA.38.15	He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it.
ISA.38.15	I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul.
ISA.38.16	Lord, men live by these things;
ISA.38.16	and my spirit finds life in all of them:
ISA.38.16	you restore me, and cause me to live.
ISA.38.17	Behold, for peace I had great anguish,
ISA.38.17	but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;
ISA.38.17	for you have cast all my sins behind your back.
ISA.38.18	For Sheol
ISA.38.18	Death can’t celebrate you.
ISA.38.18	Those who go down into the pit can’t hope for your truth.
ISA.38.19	The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do today.
ISA.38.19	The father shall make known your truth to the children.
ISA.38.20	The 
ISA.38.20	Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the 
ISA.38.21	Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.” 
ISA.38.22	Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to the 
ISA.39.1	At that time, Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered. 
ISA.39.2	Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them. 
ISA.39.3	Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?”
ISA.39.3	Hezekiah said, “They have come from a country far from me, even from Babylon.”
ISA.39.4	Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?”
ISA.39.4	Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing amongst my treasures that I have not shown them.”
ISA.39.5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the 
ISA.39.6	‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says the 
ISA.39.7	‘They will take away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon’s palace.’”
ISA.39.8	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The 
ISA.40.1	“Comfort, comfort my people,” says your God. 
ISA.40.2	“Speak comfortably to Jerusalem; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of the 
ISA.40.3	The voice of one who calls out,
ISA.40.3	“Prepare the way of the 
ISA.40.3	Make a level highway in the desert for our God.
ISA.40.4	Every valley shall be exalted,
ISA.40.4	and every mountain and hill shall be made low.
ISA.40.4	The uneven shall be made level,
ISA.40.4	and the rough places a plain.
ISA.40.5	The 
ISA.40.5	and all flesh shall see it together;
ISA.40.5	for the mouth of the 
ISA.40.6	The voice of one saying, “Cry!”
ISA.40.6	One said, “What shall I cry?”
ISA.40.6	“All flesh is like grass,
ISA.40.6	and all its glory is like the flower of the field.
ISA.40.7	The grass withers,
ISA.40.7	the flower fades,
ISA.40.7	because the 
ISA.40.7	Surely the people are like grass.
ISA.40.8	The grass withers,
ISA.40.8	the flower fades;
ISA.40.8	but the word of our God stands forever.”
ISA.40.9	You who tell good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain.
ISA.40.9	You who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with strength!
ISA.40.9	Lift it up! Don’t be afraid!
ISA.40.9	Say to the cities of Judah, “Behold, your God!”
ISA.40.10	Behold, the Lord GOD will come as a mighty one,
ISA.40.10	and his arm will rule for him.
ISA.40.10	Behold, his reward is with him,
ISA.40.10	and his recompense before him.
ISA.40.11	He will feed his flock like a shepherd.
ISA.40.11	He will gather the lambs in his arm,
ISA.40.11	and carry them in his bosom.
ISA.40.11	He will gently lead those who have their young.
ISA.40.12	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
ISA.40.12	and marked off the sky with his span,
ISA.40.12	and calculated the dust of the earth in a measuring basket,
ISA.40.12	and weighed the mountains in scales,
ISA.40.12	and the hills in a balance?
ISA.40.13	Who has directed the 
ISA.40.13	or has taught him as his counsellor?
ISA.40.14	Who did he take counsel with,
ISA.40.14	and who instructed him,
ISA.40.14	and taught him in the path of justice,
ISA.40.14	and taught him knowledge,
ISA.40.14	and showed him the way of understanding?
ISA.40.15	Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket,
ISA.40.15	and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance.
ISA.40.15	Behold, he lifts up the islands like a very little thing.
ISA.40.16	Lebanon is not sufficient to burn,
ISA.40.16	nor its animals sufficient for a burnt offering.
ISA.40.17	All the nations are like nothing before him.
ISA.40.17	They are regarded by him as less than nothing, and vanity.
ISA.40.18	To whom then will you liken God?
ISA.40.18	Or what likeness will you compare to him?
ISA.40.19	A workman has cast an image,
ISA.40.19	and the goldsmith overlays it with gold,
ISA.40.19	and casts silver chains for it.
ISA.40.20	He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot.
ISA.40.20	He seeks a skilful workman to set up a carved image for him that will not be moved.
ISA.40.21	Haven’t you known?
ISA.40.21	Haven’t you heard?
ISA.40.21	Haven’t you been told from the beginning?
ISA.40.21	Haven’t you understood from the foundations of the earth?
ISA.40.22	It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,
ISA.40.22	and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;
ISA.40.22	who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
ISA.40.22	and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in,
ISA.40.23	who brings princes to nothing,
ISA.40.23	who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.
ISA.40.24	They are planted scarcely.
ISA.40.24	They are sown scarcely.
ISA.40.24	Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground.
ISA.40.24	He merely blows on them, and they wither,
ISA.40.24	and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.
ISA.40.25	“To whom then will you liken me?
ISA.40.25	Who is my equal?” says the Holy One.
ISA.40.26	Lift up your eyes on high,
ISA.40.26	and see who has created these,
ISA.40.26	who brings out their army by number.
ISA.40.26	He calls them all by name.
ISA.40.26	by the greatness of his might,
ISA.40.26	and because he is strong in power,
ISA.40.26	not one is lacking.
ISA.40.27	Why do you say, Jacob,
ISA.40.27	and speak, Israel,
ISA.40.27	“My way is hidden from the 
ISA.40.27	and the justice due me is disregarded by my God?”
ISA.40.28	Haven’t you known?
ISA.40.28	Haven’t you heard?
ISA.40.28	The everlasting God, the 
ISA.40.28	the Creator of the ends of the earth, doesn’t faint.
ISA.40.28	He isn’t weary.
ISA.40.28	His understanding is unsearchable.
ISA.40.29	He gives power to the weak.
ISA.40.29	He increases the strength of him who has no might.
ISA.40.30	Even the youths faint and get weary,
ISA.40.30	and the young men utterly fall;
ISA.40.31	but those who wait for the 
ISA.40.31	They will mount up with wings like eagles.
ISA.40.31	They will run, and not be weary.
ISA.40.31	They will walk, and not faint.
ISA.41.1	“Keep silent before me, islands,
ISA.41.1	and let the peoples renew their strength.
ISA.41.1	Let them come near,
ISA.41.1	then let them speak.
ISA.41.1	Let’s meet together for judgement.
ISA.41.2	Who has raised up one from the east?
ISA.41.2	Who called him to his foot in righteousness?
ISA.41.2	He hands over nations to him
ISA.41.2	and makes him rule over kings.
ISA.41.2	He gives them like the dust to his sword,
ISA.41.2	like the driven stubble to his bow.
ISA.41.3	He pursues them
ISA.41.3	and passes by safely,
ISA.41.3	even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.
ISA.41.4	Who has worked and done it,
ISA.41.4	calling the generations from the beginning?
ISA.41.4	I, the 
ISA.41.5	The islands have seen, and fear.
ISA.41.5	The ends of the earth tremble.
ISA.41.5	They approach, and come.
ISA.41.6	Everyone helps his neighbour.
ISA.41.6	They say to their brothers, “Be strong!”
ISA.41.7	So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith.
ISA.41.7	He who smoothes with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil,
ISA.41.7	saying of the soldering, “It is good;”
ISA.41.7	and he fastens it with nails, that it might not totter.
ISA.41.8	“But you, Israel, my servant,
ISA.41.8	Jacob whom I have chosen,
ISA.41.8	the offspring of Abraham my friend,
ISA.41.9	You whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth,
ISA.41.9	and called from its corners,
ISA.41.9	and said to you, ‘You are my servant, I have chosen you and have not cast you away.’
ISA.41.10	Don’t you be afraid, for I am with you.
ISA.41.10	Don’t be dismayed, for I am your God.
ISA.41.10	I will strengthen you.
ISA.41.10	Yes, I will help you.
ISA.41.10	Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.
ISA.41.11	Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded.
ISA.41.11	Those who strive with you will be like nothing, and shall perish.
ISA.41.12	You will seek them, and won’t find them,
ISA.41.12	even those who contend with you.
ISA.41.12	Those who war against you will be as nothing,
ISA.41.12	as a non-existent thing.
ISA.41.13	For I, the 
ISA.41.13	saying to you, ‘Don’t be afraid.
ISA.41.13	I will help you.’
ISA.41.14	Don’t be afraid, you worm Jacob,
ISA.41.14	and you men of Israel.
ISA.41.14	I will help you,” says the 
ISA.41.14	“Your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.41.15	Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth.
ISA.41.15	You will thresh the mountains,
ISA.41.15	and beat them small,
ISA.41.15	and will make the hills like chaff.
ISA.41.16	You will winnow them,
ISA.41.16	and the wind will carry them away,
ISA.41.16	and the whirlwind will scatter them.
ISA.41.16	You will rejoice in the 
ISA.41.16	You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.41.17	The poor and needy seek water, and there is none.
ISA.41.17	Their tongue fails for thirst.
ISA.41.17	I, the 
ISA.41.17	I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
ISA.41.18	I will open rivers on the bare heights,
ISA.41.18	and springs in the middle of the valleys.
ISA.41.18	I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
ISA.41.18	and the dry land springs of water.
ISA.41.19	I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness.
ISA.41.19	I will set cypress trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;
ISA.41.20	that they may see, know, consider, and understand together,
ISA.41.20	that the 
ISA.41.20	and the Holy One of Israel has created it.
ISA.41.21	Produce your cause,” says the 
ISA.41.21	“Bring out your strong reasons!” says the King of Jacob.
ISA.41.22	“Let them announce and declare to us what will happen!
ISA.41.22	Declare the former things, what they are,
ISA.41.22	that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them;
ISA.41.22	or show us things to come.
ISA.41.23	Declare the things that are to come hereafter,
ISA.41.23	that we may know that you are gods.
ISA.41.23	Yes, do good, or do evil,
ISA.41.23	that we may be dismayed,
ISA.41.23	and see it together.
ISA.41.24	Behold, you are nothing,
ISA.41.24	and your work is nothing.
ISA.41.24	He who chooses you is an abomination.
ISA.41.25	“I have raised up one from the north, and he has come,
ISA.41.25	from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name,
ISA.41.25	and he shall come on rulers as on mortar,
ISA.41.25	and as the potter treads clay.
ISA.41.26	Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know?
ISA.41.26	and before, that we may say, ‘He is right?’
ISA.41.26	Surely, there is no one who declares.
ISA.41.26	Surely, there is no one who shows.
ISA.41.26	Surely, there is no one who hears your words.
ISA.41.27	I am the first to say to Zion, ‘Behold, look at them;’
ISA.41.27	and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem.
ISA.41.28	When I look, there is no man,
ISA.41.28	even amongst them there is no counsellor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.
ISA.41.29	Behold, all of their deeds are vanity and nothing.
ISA.41.29	Their molten images are wind and confusion.
ISA.42.1	“Behold, my servant, whom I uphold,
ISA.42.1	my chosen, in whom my soul delights:
ISA.42.1	I have put my Spirit on him.
ISA.42.1	He will bring justice to the nations.
ISA.42.2	He will not shout,
ISA.42.2	nor raise his voice,
ISA.42.2	nor cause it to be heard in the street.
ISA.42.3	He won’t break a bruised reed.
ISA.42.3	He won’t quench a dimly burning wick.
ISA.42.3	He will faithfully bring justice.
ISA.42.4	He will not fail nor be discouraged,
ISA.42.4	until he has set justice in the earth,
ISA.42.4	and the islands wait for his law.”
ISA.42.5	God the 
ISA.42.5	he who created the heavens and stretched them out,
ISA.42.5	he who spread out the earth and that which comes out of it,
ISA.42.5	he who gives breath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it, says:
ISA.42.6	“I, the 
ISA.42.6	I will hold your hand.
ISA.42.6	I will keep you,
ISA.42.6	and make you a covenant for the people,
ISA.42.6	as a light for the nations,
ISA.42.7	to open the blind eyes,
ISA.42.7	to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon,
ISA.42.7	and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.
ISA.42.8	“I am the 
ISA.42.8	That is my name.
ISA.42.8	I will not give my glory to another,
ISA.42.8	nor my praise to engraved images.
ISA.42.9	Behold, the former things have happened
ISA.42.9	and I declare new things.
ISA.42.9	I tell you about them before they come up.”
ISA.42.10	Sing to the 
ISA.42.10	and his praise from the end of the earth,
ISA.42.10	you who go down to the sea,
ISA.42.10	and all that is therein,
ISA.42.10	the islands and their inhabitants.
ISA.42.11	Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices,
ISA.42.11	with the villages that Kedar inhabits.
ISA.42.11	Let the inhabitants of Sela sing.
ISA.42.11	Let them shout from the top of the mountains!
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory to the 
ISA.42.12	and declare his praise in the islands.
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.13	He will stir up zeal like a man of war.
ISA.42.13	He will raise a war cry.
ISA.42.13	Yes, he will shout aloud.
ISA.42.13	He will triumph over his enemies.
ISA.42.14	“I have been silent a long time.
ISA.42.14	I have been quiet and restrained myself.
ISA.42.14	Now I will cry out like a travailing woman. I will both gasp and pant.
ISA.42.15	I will destroy mountains and hills,
ISA.42.15	and dry up all their herbs.
ISA.42.15	I will make the rivers islands,
ISA.42.15	and will dry up the pools.
ISA.42.16	I will bring the blind by a way that they don’t know.
ISA.42.16	I will lead them in paths that they don’t know.
ISA.42.16	I will make darkness light before them,
ISA.42.16	and crooked places straight.
ISA.42.16	I will do these things,
ISA.42.16	and I will not forsake them.
ISA.42.17	“Those who trust in engraved images,
ISA.42.17	who tell molten images,
ISA.42.17	‘You are our gods,’
ISA.42.17	will be turned back.
ISA.42.17	They will be utterly disappointed.
ISA.42.18	“Hear, you deaf,
ISA.42.18	and look, you blind,
ISA.42.18	that you may see.
ISA.42.19	Who is blind, but my servant?
ISA.42.19	Or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send?
ISA.42.19	Who is as blind as he who is at peace,
ISA.42.19	and as blind as the 
ISA.42.20	You see many things, but don’t observe.
ISA.42.20	His ears are open, but he doesn’t listen.
ISA.42.21	It pleased the 
ISA.42.21	and make it honourable.
ISA.42.22	But this is a robbed and plundered people.
ISA.42.22	All of them are snared in holes,
ISA.42.22	and they are hidden in prisons.
ISA.42.22	They have become captives, and no one delivers,
ISA.42.22	and a plunder, and no one says, ‘Restore them!’
ISA.42.23	Who is there amongst you who will give ear to this?
ISA.42.23	Who will listen and hear for the time to come?
ISA.42.24	Who gave Jacob as plunder,
ISA.42.24	and Israel to the robbers?
ISA.42.24	Didn’t the 
ISA.42.24	For they would not walk in his ways,
ISA.42.24	and they disobeyed his law.
ISA.42.25	Therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him,
ISA.42.25	and the strength of battle.
ISA.42.25	It set him on fire all around, but he didn’t know.
ISA.42.25	It burnt him, but he didn’t take it to heart.”
ISA.43.1	But now the 
ISA.43.1	and he who formed you, Israel, says:
ISA.43.1	“Don’t be afraid, for I have redeemed you.
ISA.43.1	I have called you by your name.
ISA.43.1	You are mine.
ISA.43.2	When you pass through the waters, I will be with you,
ISA.43.2	and through the rivers, they will not overflow you.
ISA.43.2	When you walk through the fire, you will not be burnt,
ISA.43.2	and flame will not scorch you.
ISA.43.3	For I am the 
ISA.43.3	the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.43.3	your Saviour.
ISA.43.3	I have given Egypt as your ransom,
ISA.43.3	Ethiopia and Seba in your place.
ISA.43.4	Since you have been precious and honoured in my sight,
ISA.43.4	and I have loved you,
ISA.43.4	therefore I will give people in your place,
ISA.43.4	and nations instead of your life.
ISA.43.5	Don’t be afraid, for I am with you.
ISA.43.5	I will bring your offspring from the east,
ISA.43.5	and gather you from the west.
ISA.43.6	I will tell the north, ‘Give them up!’
ISA.43.6	and tell the south, ‘Don’t hold them back!
ISA.43.6	Bring my sons from far away,
ISA.43.6	and my daughters from the ends of the earth—
ISA.43.7	everyone who is called by my name,
ISA.43.7	and whom I have created for my glory,
ISA.43.7	whom I have formed,
ISA.43.7	yes, whom I have made.’”
ISA.43.8	Bring out the blind people who have eyes,
ISA.43.8	and the deaf who have ears.
ISA.43.9	Let all the nations be gathered together,
ISA.43.9	and let the peoples be assembled.
ISA.43.9	Who amongst them can declare this,
ISA.43.9	and show us former things?
ISA.43.9	Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified,
ISA.43.9	or let them hear, and say, “That is true.”
ISA.43.10	“You are my witnesses,” says the 
ISA.43.10	“With my servant whom I have chosen;
ISA.43.10	that you may know and believe me,
ISA.43.10	and understand that I am he.
ISA.43.10	Before me there was no God formed,
ISA.43.10	neither will there be after me.
ISA.43.11	I myself am the 
ISA.43.11	Besides me, there is no saviour.
ISA.43.12	I have declared, I have saved, and I have shown,
ISA.43.12	and there was no strange god amongst you.
ISA.43.12	Therefore you are my witnesses”,
ISA.43.12	says the 
ISA.43.13	Yes, since the day was, I am he.
ISA.43.13	There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.
ISA.43.13	I will work, and who can hinder it?”
ISA.43.14	The 
ISA.43.15	I am the 
ISA.43.16	The 
ISA.43.16	and a path in the mighty waters,
ISA.43.17	who brings out the chariot and horse,
ISA.43.17	the army and the mighty man
ISA.43.17	(they lie down together, they shall not rise;
ISA.43.17	they are extinct, they are quenched like a wick) says:
ISA.43.18	“Don’t remember the former things,
ISA.43.18	and don’t consider the things of old.
ISA.43.19	Behold, I will do a new thing.
ISA.43.19	It springs out now.
ISA.43.19	Don’t you know it?
ISA.43.19	I will even make a way in the wilderness,
ISA.43.19	and rivers in the desert.
ISA.43.20	The animals of the field, the jackals and the ostriches, shall honour me,
ISA.43.20	because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert,
ISA.43.20	to give drink to my people, my chosen,
ISA.43.21	the people which I formed for myself,
ISA.43.21	that they might declare my praise.
ISA.43.22	Yet you have not called on me, Jacob;
ISA.43.22	but you have been weary of me, Israel.
ISA.43.23	You have not brought me any of your sheep for burnt offerings,
ISA.43.23	neither have you honoured me with your sacrifices.
ISA.43.23	I have not burdened you with offerings,
ISA.43.23	nor wearied you with frankincense.
ISA.43.24	You have bought me no sweet cane with money,
ISA.43.24	nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices,
ISA.43.24	but you have burdened me with your sins.
ISA.43.24	You have wearied me with your iniquities.
ISA.43.25	I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake;
ISA.43.25	and I will not remember your sins.
ISA.43.26	Put me in remembrance.
ISA.43.26	Let us plead together.
ISA.43.26	Declare your case,
ISA.43.26	that you may be justified.
ISA.43.27	Your first father sinned,
ISA.43.27	and your teachers have transgressed against me.
ISA.43.28	Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary;
ISA.43.28	and I will make Jacob a curse,
ISA.43.28	and Israel an insult.”
ISA.44.1	Yet listen now, Jacob my servant,
ISA.44.1	and Israel, whom I have chosen.
ISA.44.2	This is what the 
ISA.44.2	and formed you from the womb,
ISA.44.2	who will help you says:
ISA.44.2	“Don’t be afraid, Jacob my servant;
ISA.44.2	and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
ISA.44.3	For I will pour water on him who is thirsty,
ISA.44.3	and streams on the dry ground.
ISA.44.3	I will pour my Spirit on your descendants,
ISA.44.3	and my blessing on your offspring:
ISA.44.4	and they will spring up amongst the grass,
ISA.44.4	as willows by the watercourses.
ISA.44.5	One will say, ‘I am the 
ISA.44.5	and another will be called by the name of Jacob;
ISA.44.5	and another will write with his hand ‘to the 
ISA.44.5	and honour the name of Israel.”
ISA.44.6	This is what the 
ISA.44.6	and his Redeemer, the 
ISA.44.6	“I am the first, and I am the last;
ISA.44.6	and besides me there is no God.
ISA.44.7	Who is like me?
ISA.44.7	Who will call,
ISA.44.7	and will declare it,
ISA.44.7	and set it in order for me,
ISA.44.7	since I established the ancient people?
ISA.44.7	Let them declare the things that are coming,
ISA.44.7	and that will happen.
ISA.44.8	Don’t fear,
ISA.44.8	neither be afraid.
ISA.44.8	Haven’t I declared it to you long ago,
ISA.44.8	and shown it?
ISA.44.8	You are my witnesses.
ISA.44.8	Is there a God besides me?
ISA.44.8	Indeed, there is not.
ISA.44.8	I don’t know any other Rock.”
ISA.44.9	Everyone who makes a carved image is vain.
ISA.44.9	The things that they delight in will not profit.
ISA.44.9	Their own witnesses don’t see, nor know, that they may be disappointed.
ISA.44.10	Who has fashioned a god,
ISA.44.10	or moulds an image that is profitable for nothing?
ISA.44.11	Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed;
ISA.44.11	and the workmen are mere men.
ISA.44.11	Let them all be gathered together.
ISA.44.11	Let them stand up.
ISA.44.11	They will fear.
ISA.44.11	They will be put to shame together.
ISA.44.12	The blacksmith takes an axe,
ISA.44.12	works in the coals,
ISA.44.12	fashions it with hammers,
ISA.44.12	and works it with his strong arm.
ISA.44.12	He is hungry,
ISA.44.12	and his strength fails;
ISA.44.12	he drinks no water,
ISA.44.12	and is faint.
ISA.44.13	The carpenter stretches out a line.
ISA.44.13	He marks it out with a pencil.
ISA.44.13	He shapes it with planes.
ISA.44.13	He marks it out with compasses,
ISA.44.13	and shapes it like the figure of a man,
ISA.44.13	with the beauty of a man,
ISA.44.13	to reside in a house.
ISA.44.14	He cuts down cedars for himself,
ISA.44.14	and takes the cypress and the oak,
ISA.44.14	and strengthens for himself one amongst the trees of the forest.
ISA.44.14	He plants a cypress tree,
ISA.44.14	and the rain nourishes it.
ISA.44.15	Then it will be for a man to burn;
ISA.44.15	and he takes some of it, and warms himself.
ISA.44.15	Yes, he burns it, and bakes bread.
ISA.44.15	Yes, he makes a god, and worships it;
ISA.44.15	he makes it a carved image, and falls down to it.
ISA.44.16	He burns part of it in the fire.
ISA.44.16	With part of it, he eats meat.
ISA.44.16	He roasts a roast, and is satisfied.
ISA.44.16	Yes, he warms himself,
ISA.44.16	and says, “Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire.”
ISA.44.17	The rest of it he makes into a god,
ISA.44.17	even his engraved image.
ISA.44.17	He bows down to it and worships,
ISA.44.17	and prays to it, and says, “Deliver me; for you are my god!”
ISA.44.18	They don’t know, neither do they consider:
ISA.44.18	for he has shut their eyes, that they can’t see;
ISA.44.18	and their hearts, that they can’t understand.
ISA.44.19	No one thinks,
ISA.44.19	neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say,
ISA.44.19	“I have burnt part of it in the fire.
ISA.44.19	Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals.
ISA.44.19	I have roasted meat and eaten it.
ISA.44.19	Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination?
ISA.44.19	Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?”
ISA.44.20	He feeds on ashes.
ISA.44.20	A deceived heart has turned him aside;
ISA.44.20	and he can’t deliver his soul,
ISA.44.20	nor say, “Isn’t there a lie in my right hand?”
ISA.44.21	Remember these things, Jacob and Israel;
ISA.44.21	for you are my servant.
ISA.44.21	I have formed you.
ISA.44.21	You are my servant.
ISA.44.21	Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.
ISA.44.22	I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions,
ISA.44.22	and, as a cloud, your sins.
ISA.44.22	Return to me, for I have redeemed you.
ISA.44.23	Sing, you heavens, for the 
ISA.44.23	Shout, you lower parts of the earth!
ISA.44.23	Break out into singing, you mountains, O forest, all of your trees,
ISA.44.23	for the 
ISA.44.23	and will glorify himself in Israel.
ISA.44.24	The 
ISA.44.24	and he who formed you from the womb says:
ISA.44.24	“I am the 
ISA.44.24	who alone stretches out the heavens;
ISA.44.24	who spreads out the earth by myself;
ISA.44.25	who frustrates the signs of the liars,
ISA.44.25	and makes diviners mad;
ISA.44.25	who turns wise men backward,
ISA.44.25	and makes their knowledge foolish;
ISA.44.26	who confirms the word of his servant,
ISA.44.26	and performs the counsel of his messengers;
ISA.44.26	who says of Jerusalem, ‘She will be inhabited;’
ISA.44.26	and of the cities of Judah, ‘They will be built,’
ISA.44.26	and ‘I will raise up its waste places;’
ISA.44.27	who says to the deep, ‘Be dry,’
ISA.44.27	and ‘I will dry up your rivers;’
ISA.44.28	Who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure,’
ISA.44.28	even saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be built;’
ISA.44.28	and of the temple, ‘Your foundation will be laid.’”
ISA.45.1	The 
ISA.45.2	“I will go before you
ISA.45.2	and make the rough places smooth.
ISA.45.2	I will break the doors of bronze in pieces
ISA.45.2	and cut apart the bars of iron.
ISA.45.3	I will give you the treasures of darkness
ISA.45.3	and hidden riches of secret places,
ISA.45.3	that you may know that it is I, the 
ISA.45.3	even the God of Israel.
ISA.45.4	For Jacob my servant’s sake,
ISA.45.4	and Israel my chosen,
ISA.45.4	I have called you by your name.
ISA.45.4	I have given you a title,
ISA.45.4	though you have not known me.
ISA.45.5	I am the 
ISA.45.5	Besides me, there is no God.
ISA.45.5	I will strengthen
ISA.45.5	though you have not known me,
ISA.45.6	that they may know from the rising of the sun,
ISA.45.6	and from the west,
ISA.45.6	that there is no one besides me.
ISA.45.6	I am the 
ISA.45.7	I form the light
ISA.45.7	and create darkness.
ISA.45.7	I make peace
ISA.45.7	and create calamity.
ISA.45.7	I am the 
ISA.45.7	who does all these things.
ISA.45.8	Rain, you heavens, from above,
ISA.45.8	and let the skies pour down righteousness.
ISA.45.8	Let the earth open, that it may produce salvation,
ISA.45.8	and let it cause righteousness to spring up with it.
ISA.45.8	I, the 
ISA.45.9	Woe to him who strives with his Maker—
ISA.45.9	a clay pot amongst the clay pots of the earth!
ISA.45.9	Shall the clay ask him who fashions it, ‘What are you making?’
ISA.45.9	or your work, ‘He has no hands?’
ISA.45.10	Woe to him who says to a father, ‘What have you become the father of?’
ISA.45.10	or to a mother, ‘What have you given birth to?’”
ISA.45.11	The 
ISA.45.11	and his Maker says:
ISA.45.11	“You ask me about the things that are to come, concerning my sons,
ISA.45.11	and you command me concerning the work of my hands!
ISA.45.12	I have made the earth, and created man on it.
ISA.45.12	I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens.
ISA.45.12	I have commanded all their army.
ISA.45.13	I have raised him up in righteousness,
ISA.45.13	and I will make all his ways straight.
ISA.45.13	He shall build my city,
ISA.45.13	and he shall let my exiles go free,
ISA.45.13	not for price nor reward,” says the 
ISA.45.14	The 
ISA.45.14	and the merchandise of Ethiopia,
ISA.45.14	and the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you,
ISA.45.14	and they will be yours.
ISA.45.14	They will go after you.
ISA.45.14	They shall come over in chains.
ISA.45.14	They will bow down to you.
ISA.45.14	They will make supplication to you:
ISA.45.14	‘Surely God is in you; and there is no one else.
ISA.45.14	There is no other god.
ISA.45.15	Most certainly you are a God who has hidden yourself,
ISA.45.15	God of Israel, the Saviour.’”
ISA.45.16	They will be disappointed,
ISA.45.16	yes, confounded, all of them.
ISA.45.16	Those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together.
ISA.45.17	Israel will be saved by the 
ISA.45.17	You will not be disappointed nor confounded to ages everlasting.
ISA.45.18	For the 
ISA.45.18	the God who formed the earth and made it,
ISA.45.18	who established it and didn’t create it a waste,
ISA.45.18	who formed it to be inhabited says:
ISA.45.18	“I am the 
ISA.45.18	There is no other.
ISA.45.19	I have not spoken in secret,
ISA.45.19	in a place of the land of darkness.
ISA.45.19	I didn’t say to the offspring of Jacob, ‘Seek me in vain.’
ISA.45.19	I, the 
ISA.45.19	I declare things that are right.
ISA.45.20	“Assemble yourselves and come.
ISA.45.20	Draw near together, you who have escaped from the nations.
ISA.45.20	Those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved image,
ISA.45.20	and pray to a god that can’t save.
ISA.45.21	Declare and present it.
ISA.45.21	Yes, let them take counsel together.
ISA.45.21	Who has shown this from ancient time?
ISA.45.21	Who has declared it of old?
ISA.45.21	Haven’t I, the 
ISA.45.21	There is no other God besides me, a just God and a Saviour.
ISA.45.21	There is no one besides me.
ISA.45.22	“Look to me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth;
ISA.45.22	for I am God, and there is no other.
ISA.45.23	I have sworn by myself.
ISA.45.23	The word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and will not be revoked,
ISA.45.23	that to me every knee shall bow,
ISA.45.23	every tongue shall take an oath.
ISA.45.24	They will say of me,
ISA.45.24	‘There is righteousness and strength only in the 
ISA.45.24	Even to him will men come.
ISA.45.24	All those who raged against him will be disappointed.
ISA.45.25	All the offspring of Israel will be justified in the 
ISA.45.25	and will rejoice!
ISA.46.1	Bel bows down.
ISA.46.1	Nebo stoops.
ISA.46.1	Their idols are carried by animals,
ISA.46.1	and on the livestock.
ISA.46.1	The things that you carried around are heavy loads,
ISA.46.1	a burden for the weary.
ISA.46.2	They stoop and they bow down together.
ISA.46.2	They could not deliver the burden,
ISA.46.2	but they have gone into captivity.
ISA.46.3	“Listen to me, house of Jacob,
ISA.46.3	and all the remnant of the house of Israel,
ISA.46.3	that have been carried from their birth,
ISA.46.3	that have been carried from the womb.
ISA.46.4	Even to old age I am he,
ISA.46.4	and even to grey hairs I will carry you.
ISA.46.4	I have made, and I will bear.
ISA.46.4	Yes, I will carry, and will deliver.
ISA.46.5	“To whom will you compare me, and consider my equal,
ISA.46.5	and compare me, as if we were the same?
ISA.46.6	Some pour out gold from the bag,
ISA.46.6	and weigh silver in the balance.
ISA.46.6	They hire a goldsmith,
ISA.46.6	and he makes it a god.
ISA.46.6	They fall down—
ISA.46.6	yes, they worship.
ISA.46.7	They bear it on their shoulder.
ISA.46.7	They carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands there.
ISA.46.7	It cannot move from its place.
ISA.46.7	Yes, one may cry to it, yet it can not answer.
ISA.46.7	It cannot save him out of his trouble.
ISA.46.8	“Remember this, and show yourselves men.
ISA.46.8	Bring it to mind again, you transgressors.
ISA.46.9	Remember the former things of old:
ISA.46.9	for I am God, and there is no other.
ISA.46.9	I am God, and there is none like me.
ISA.46.10	I declare the end from the beginning,
ISA.46.10	and from ancient times things that are not yet done.
ISA.46.10	I say: My counsel will stand,
ISA.46.10	and I will do all that I please.
ISA.46.11	I call a ravenous bird from the east,
ISA.46.11	the man of my counsel from a far country.
ISA.46.11	Yes, I have spoken.
ISA.46.11	I will also bring it to pass.
ISA.46.11	I have planned.
ISA.46.11	I will also do it.
ISA.46.12	Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted,
ISA.46.12	who are far from righteousness!
ISA.46.13	I bring my righteousness near.
ISA.46.13	It is not far off,
ISA.46.13	and my salvation will not wait.
ISA.46.13	I will grant salvation to Zion,
ISA.46.13	my glory to Israel.
ISA.47.1	“Come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon.
ISA.47.1	Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans.
ISA.47.1	For you will no longer be called tender and delicate.
ISA.47.2	Take the millstones and grind flour.
ISA.47.2	Remove your veil, lift up your skirt, uncover your legs,
ISA.47.2	and wade through the rivers.
ISA.47.3	Your nakedness will be uncovered.
ISA.47.3	Yes, your shame will be seen.
ISA.47.3	I will take vengeance,
ISA.47.3	and will spare no one.”
ISA.47.4	Our Redeemer, the 
ISA.47.4	is the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.47.5	“Sit in silence, and go into darkness,
ISA.47.5	daughter of the Chaldeans.
ISA.47.5	For you shall no longer be called
ISA.47.5	the mistress of kingdoms.
ISA.47.6	I was angry with my people.
ISA.47.6	I profaned my inheritance
ISA.47.6	and gave them into your hand.
ISA.47.6	You showed them no mercy.
ISA.47.6	You laid a very heavy yoke on the aged.
ISA.47.7	You said, ‘I will be a princess forever,’
ISA.47.7	so that you didn’t lay these things to your heart,
ISA.47.7	nor did you remember the results.
ISA.47.8	“Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures,
ISA.47.8	who sit securely,
ISA.47.8	who say in your heart,
ISA.47.8	‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.
ISA.47.8	I won’t sit as a widow,
ISA.47.8	neither will I know the loss of children.’
ISA.47.9	But these two things will come to you in a moment in one day,
ISA.47.9	the loss of children and widowhood.
ISA.47.9	They will come on you in their full measure,
ISA.47.9	in the multitude of your sorceries,
ISA.47.9	and the great abundance of your enchantments.
ISA.47.10	For you have trusted in your wickedness.
ISA.47.10	You have said, ‘No one sees me.’
ISA.47.10	Your wisdom and your knowledge has perverted you.
ISA.47.10	You have said in your heart, ‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.’
ISA.47.11	Therefore disaster will come on you.
ISA.47.11	You won’t know when it dawns.
ISA.47.11	Mischief will fall on you.
ISA.47.11	You won’t be able to put it away.
ISA.47.11	Desolation will come on you suddenly,
ISA.47.11	which you don’t understand.
ISA.47.12	“Stand now with your enchantments
ISA.47.12	and with the multitude of your sorceries,
ISA.47.12	in which you have laboured from your youth,
ISA.47.12	as if you might profit,
ISA.47.12	as if you might prevail.
ISA.47.13	You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels.
ISA.47.13	Now let the astrologers, the stargazers, and the monthly prognosticators stand up and save you from the things that will happen to you.
ISA.47.14	Behold, they are like stubble.
ISA.47.14	The fire will burn them.
ISA.47.14	They won’t deliver themselves from the power of the flame.
ISA.47.14	It won’t be a coal to warm at
ISA.47.14	or a fire to sit by.
ISA.47.15	The things that you laboured in will be like this:
ISA.47.15	those who have trafficked with you from your youth will each wander in his own way.
ISA.47.15	There will be no one to save you.
ISA.48.1	“Hear this, house of Jacob,
ISA.48.1	you who are called by the name of Israel,
ISA.48.1	and have come out of the waters of Judah.
ISA.48.1	You swear by the 
ISA.48.1	and make mention of the God of Israel,
ISA.48.1	but not in truth, nor in righteousness—
ISA.48.2	for they call themselves citizens of the holy city,
ISA.48.2	and rely on the God of Israel;
ISA.48.2	the 
ISA.48.3	I have declared the former things from of old.
ISA.48.3	Yes, they went out of my mouth, and I revealed them.
ISA.48.3	I did them suddenly, and they happened.
ISA.48.4	Because I knew that you are obstinate,
ISA.48.4	and your neck is an iron sinew,
ISA.48.4	and your brow bronze;
ISA.48.5	therefore I have declared it to you from of old;
ISA.48.5	before it came to pass I showed it to you;
ISA.48.5	lest you should say, ‘My idol has done them.
ISA.48.5	My engraved image and my molten image has commanded them.’
ISA.48.6	You have heard it.
ISA.48.6	Now see all this.
ISA.48.6	And you, won’t you declare it?
ISA.48.6	“I have shown you new things from this time,
ISA.48.6	even hidden things, which you have not known.
ISA.48.7	They are created now, and not from of old.
ISA.48.7	Before today, you didn’t hear them,
ISA.48.7	lest you should say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’
ISA.48.8	Yes, you didn’t hear.
ISA.48.8	Yes, you didn’t know.
ISA.48.8	Yes, from of old your ear was not opened,
ISA.48.8	for I knew that you dealt very treacherously,
ISA.48.8	and were called a transgressor from the womb.
ISA.48.9	For my name’s sake, I will defer my anger,
ISA.48.9	and for my praise, I hold it back for you
ISA.48.9	so that I don’t cut you off.
ISA.48.10	Behold, I have refined you,
ISA.48.10	but not as silver.
ISA.48.10	I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.
ISA.48.11	For my own sake,
ISA.48.11	for my own sake, I will do it;
ISA.48.11	for how would my name be profaned?
ISA.48.11	I will not give my glory to another.
ISA.48.12	“Listen to me, O Jacob,
ISA.48.12	and Israel my called:
ISA.48.12	I am he.
ISA.48.12	I am the first.
ISA.48.12	I am also the last.
ISA.48.13	Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth,
ISA.48.13	and my right hand has spread out the heavens.
ISA.48.13	when I call to them, they stand up together.
ISA.48.14	“Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear!
ISA.48.14	Who amongst them has declared these things?
ISA.48.14	He whom the 
ISA.48.14	and his arm will be against the Chaldeans.
ISA.48.15	I, even I, have spoken.
ISA.48.15	Yes, I have called him.
ISA.48.15	I have brought him
ISA.48.15	and he shall make his way prosperous.
ISA.48.16	“Come near to me and hear this:
ISA.48.16	“From the beginning I have not spoken in secret;
ISA.48.16	from the time that it happened, I was there.”
ISA.48.16	Now the Lord GOD has sent me
ISA.48.16	with his Spirit.
ISA.48.17	The 
ISA.48.17	your Redeemer,
ISA.48.17	the Holy One of Israel says:
ISA.48.17	“I am the 
ISA.48.17	who teaches you to profit,
ISA.48.17	who leads you by the way that you should go.
ISA.48.18	Oh that you had listened to my commandments!
ISA.48.18	Then your peace would have been like a river
ISA.48.18	and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
ISA.48.19	Your offspring also would have been as the sand
ISA.48.19	and the descendants of your body like its grains.
ISA.48.19	His name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.”
ISA.48.20	Leave Babylon!
ISA.48.20	Flee from the Chaldeans!
ISA.48.20	With a voice of singing announce this,
ISA.48.20	tell it even to the end of the earth:
ISA.48.20	say, “The 
ISA.48.21	They didn’t thirst when he led them through the deserts.
ISA.48.21	He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them.
ISA.48.21	He also split the rock and the waters gushed out.
ISA.48.22	“There is no peace”, says the 
ISA.49.1	Listen, islands, to me.
ISA.49.1	Listen, you peoples, from afar:
ISA.49.1	the 
ISA.49.1	from the inside of my mother, he has mentioned my name.
ISA.49.2	He has made my mouth like a sharp sword.
ISA.49.2	He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand.
ISA.49.2	He has made me a polished shaft.
ISA.49.2	He has kept me close in his quiver.
ISA.49.3	He said to me, “You are my servant,
ISA.49.3	Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”
ISA.49.4	But I said, “I have laboured in vain.
ISA.49.4	I have spent my strength in vain for nothing;
ISA.49.4	yet surely the justice due to me is with the 
ISA.49.4	and my reward with my God.”
ISA.49.5	Now the 
ISA.49.5	says to bring Jacob again to him,
ISA.49.5	and to gather Israel to him,
ISA.49.5	for I am honourable in the 
ISA.49.5	and my God has become my strength.
ISA.49.6	Indeed, he says, “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,
ISA.49.6	and to restore the preserved of Israel.
ISA.49.6	I will also give you as a light to the nations,
ISA.49.6	that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.”
ISA.49.7	The 
ISA.49.7	says to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers:
ISA.49.7	“Kings shall see and rise up,
ISA.49.7	princes, and they shall worship,
ISA.49.7	because of the 
ISA.49.8	The 
ISA.49.8	I have helped you in a day of salvation.
ISA.49.8	I will preserve you and give you for a covenant of the people,
ISA.49.8	to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage,
ISA.49.9	saying to those who are bound, ‘Come out!’;
ISA.49.9	to those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves!’
ISA.49.9	“They shall feed along the paths,
ISA.49.9	and their pasture shall be on all treeless heights.
ISA.49.10	They shall not hunger nor thirst;
ISA.49.10	neither shall the heat nor sun strike them:
ISA.49.10	for he who has mercy on them will lead them.
ISA.49.10	He will guide them by springs of water.
ISA.49.11	I will make all my mountains a road,
ISA.49.11	and my highways shall be exalted.
ISA.49.12	Behold, these shall come from afar,
ISA.49.12	and behold, these from the north and from the west;
ISA.49.12	and these from the land of Sinim.”
ISA.49.13	Sing, heavens, and be joyful, earth!
ISA.49.13	Break out into singing, mountains,
ISA.49.13	for the 
ISA.49.13	and will have compassion on his afflicted.
ISA.49.14	But Zion said, “The 
ISA.49.14	and the Lord has forgotten me.”
ISA.49.15	“Can a woman forget her nursing child,
ISA.49.15	that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?
ISA.49.15	Yes, these may forget,
ISA.49.15	yet I will not forget you!
ISA.49.16	Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.
ISA.49.16	Your walls are continually before me.
ISA.49.17	Your children hurry.
ISA.49.17	Your destroyers and those who devastated you will leave you.
ISA.49.18	Lift up your eyes all around, and see:
ISA.49.18	all these gather themselves together, and come to you.
ISA.49.18	As I live,” says the 
ISA.49.18	and dress yourself with them, like a bride.
ISA.49.19	“For, as for your waste and your desolate places,
ISA.49.19	and your land that has been destroyed,
ISA.49.19	surely now that land will be too small for the inhabitants,
ISA.49.19	and those who swallowed you up will be far away.
ISA.49.20	The children of your bereavement will say in your ears,
ISA.49.20	‘This place is too small for me.
ISA.49.20	Give me a place to live in.’
ISA.49.21	Then you will say in your heart, ‘Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children
ISA.49.21	and am alone, an exile, and wandering back and forth?
ISA.49.21	Who has brought these up?
ISA.49.21	Behold, I was left alone. Where were these?’”
ISA.49.22	The Lord GOD says, “Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations,
ISA.49.22	and lift up my banner to the peoples.
ISA.49.22	They shall bring your sons in their bosom,
ISA.49.22	and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
ISA.49.23	Kings shall be your foster fathers,
ISA.49.23	and their queens your nursing mothers.
ISA.49.23	They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth,
ISA.49.23	and lick the dust of your feet.
ISA.49.23	Then you will know that I am the 
ISA.49.23	and those who wait for me shall not be disappointed.”
ISA.49.24	Shall the plunder be taken from the mighty,
ISA.49.24	or the lawful captives be delivered?
ISA.49.25	But the 
ISA.49.25	and the plunder retrieved from the fierce,
ISA.49.25	for I will contend with him who contends with you
ISA.49.25	and I will save your children.
ISA.49.26	I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh;
ISA.49.26	and they will be drunk on their own blood, as with sweet wine.
ISA.49.26	Then all flesh shall know that I, the 
ISA.49.26	and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
ISA.50.1	The 
ISA.50.1	Or to which of my creditors have I sold you?
ISA.50.1	Behold, you were sold for your iniquities,
ISA.50.1	and your mother was put away for your transgressions.
ISA.50.2	Why, when I came, was there no one?
ISA.50.2	When I called, why was there no one to answer?
ISA.50.2	Is my hand shortened at all, that it can’t redeem?
ISA.50.2	Or have I no power to deliver?
ISA.50.2	Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea.
ISA.50.2	I make the rivers a wilderness.
ISA.50.2	Their fish stink because there is no water, and die of thirst.
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with blackness.
ISA.50.3	I make sackcloth their covering.”
ISA.50.4	The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of those who are taught,
ISA.50.4	that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary.
ISA.50.4	He awakens morning by morning,
ISA.50.4	he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.
ISA.50.5	The Lord GOD has opened my ear.
ISA.50.5	I was not rebellious.
ISA.50.5	I have not turned back.
ISA.50.6	I gave my back to those who beat me,
ISA.50.6	and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair.
ISA.50.6	I didn’t hide my face from shame and spitting.
ISA.50.7	For the Lord GOD will help me.
ISA.50.7	Therefore I have not been confounded.
ISA.50.7	Therefore I have set my face like a flint,
ISA.50.7	and I know that I won’t be disappointed.
ISA.50.8	He who justifies me is near.
ISA.50.8	Who will bring charges against me?
ISA.50.8	Let us stand up together.
ISA.50.8	Who is my adversary?
ISA.50.8	Let him come near to me.
ISA.50.9	Behold, the Lord GOD will help me!
ISA.50.9	Who is he who will condemn me?
ISA.50.9	Behold, they will all grow old like a garment.
ISA.50.9	The moths will eat them up.
ISA.50.10	Who amongst you fears the 
ISA.50.10	and obeys the voice of his servant?
ISA.50.10	He who walks in darkness
ISA.50.10	and has no light,
ISA.50.10	let him trust in the 
ISA.50.10	and rely on his God.
ISA.50.11	Behold, all you who kindle a fire,
ISA.50.11	who adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves,
ISA.50.11	walk in the flame of your fire,
ISA.50.11	and amongst the torches that you have kindled.
ISA.50.11	You will have this from my hand:
ISA.50.11	you will lie down in sorrow.
ISA.51.1	“Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness,
ISA.51.1	you who seek the 
ISA.51.1	Look to the rock you were cut from,
ISA.51.1	and to the quarry you were dug from.
ISA.51.2	Look to Abraham your father,
ISA.51.2	and to Sarah who bore you;
ISA.51.2	for when he was but one I called him,
ISA.51.2	I blessed him,
ISA.51.2	and made him many.
ISA.51.3	For the 
ISA.51.3	He has comforted all her waste places,
ISA.51.3	and has made her wilderness like Eden,
ISA.51.3	and her desert like the garden of the 
ISA.51.3	Joy and gladness will be found in them,
ISA.51.3	thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
ISA.51.4	“Listen to me, my people;
ISA.51.4	and hear me, my nation,
ISA.51.4	for a law will go out from me,
ISA.51.4	and I will establish my justice for a light to the peoples.
ISA.51.5	My righteousness is near.
ISA.51.5	My salvation has gone out,
ISA.51.5	and my arms will judge the peoples.
ISA.51.5	The islands will wait for me,
ISA.51.5	and they will trust my arm.
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
ISA.51.6	and look at the earth beneath;
ISA.51.6	for the heavens will vanish away like smoke,
ISA.51.6	and the earth will wear out like a garment.
ISA.51.6	Its inhabitants will die in the same way,
ISA.51.6	but my salvation will be forever,
ISA.51.6	and my righteousness will not be abolished.
ISA.51.7	“Listen to me, you who know righteousness,
ISA.51.7	the people in whose heart is my law.
ISA.51.7	Don’t fear the reproach of men,
ISA.51.7	and don’t be dismayed at their insults.
ISA.51.8	For the moth will eat them up like a garment,
ISA.51.8	and the worm will eat them like wool;
ISA.51.8	but my righteousness will be forever,
ISA.51.8	and my salvation to all generations.”
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of the 
ISA.51.9	Awake, as in the days of old,
ISA.51.9	the generations of ancient times.
ISA.51.9	Isn’t it you who cut Rahab in pieces,
ISA.51.9	who pierced the monster?
ISA.51.10	Isn’t it you who dried up the sea,
ISA.51.10	the waters of the great deep;
ISA.51.10	who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
ISA.51.11	Those ransomed by the 
ISA.51.11	and come with singing to Zion.
ISA.51.11	Everlasting joy shall be on their heads.
ISA.51.11	They will obtain gladness and joy.
ISA.51.11	Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
ISA.51.12	“I, even I, am he who comforts you.
ISA.51.12	Who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die,
ISA.51.12	and of the son of man who will be made as grass?
ISA.51.13	Have you forgotten the 
ISA.51.13	who stretched out the heavens,
ISA.51.13	and laid the foundations of the earth?
ISA.51.13	Do you live in fear continually all day because of the fury of the oppressor,
ISA.51.13	when he prepares to destroy?
ISA.51.13	Where is the fury of the oppressor?
ISA.51.14	The captive exile will speedily be freed.
ISA.51.14	He will not die and go down into the pit.
ISA.51.14	His bread won’t fail.
ISA.51.15	For I am the 
ISA.51.15	so that its waves roar.
ISA.51.15	the 
ISA.51.16	I have put my words in your mouth
ISA.51.16	and have covered you in the shadow of my hand,
ISA.51.16	that I may plant the heavens,
ISA.51.16	and lay the foundations of the earth,
ISA.51.16	and tell Zion, ‘You are my people.’”
ISA.51.17	Awake, awake!
ISA.51.17	Stand up, Jerusalem,
ISA.51.17	you who have drunk from the 
ISA.51.17	You have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering,
ISA.51.17	and drained it.
ISA.51.18	There is no one to guide her amongst all the sons to whom she has given birth;
ISA.51.18	and there is no one who takes her by the hand amongst all the sons whom she has brought up.
ISA.51.19	These two things have happened to you—
ISA.51.19	who will grieve with you?—
ISA.51.19	desolation and destruction,
ISA.51.19	and famine and the sword.
ISA.51.19	How can I comfort you?
ISA.51.20	Your sons have fainted.
ISA.51.20	They lie at the head of all the streets,
ISA.51.20	like an antelope in a net.
ISA.51.20	They are full of the 
ISA.51.20	the rebuke of your God.
ISA.51.21	Therefore now hear this, you afflicted,
ISA.51.21	and drunken, but not with wine:
ISA.51.22	Your Lord GOD,
ISA.51.22	your God who pleads the cause of his people, says,
ISA.51.22	“Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering,
ISA.51.22	even the bowl of the cup of my wrath.
ISA.51.22	You will not drink it any more.
ISA.51.23	I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you,
ISA.51.23	who have said to your soul, ‘Bow down, that we may walk over you;’
ISA.51.23	and you have laid your back as the ground,
ISA.51.23	like a street to those who walk over.”
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake! Put on your strength, Zion.
ISA.52.1	Put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city:
ISA.52.1	for from now on the uncircumcised and the unclean will no more come into you.
ISA.52.2	Shake yourself from the dust!
ISA.52.2	Arise, sit up, Jerusalem!
ISA.52.2	Release yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion!
ISA.52.3	For the 
ISA.52.3	and you will be redeemed without money.”
ISA.52.4	For the Lord GOD says:
ISA.52.4	“My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there:
ISA.52.4	and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.
ISA.52.5	“Now therefore, what do I do here,” says the 
ISA.52.5	“seeing that my people are taken away for nothing?
ISA.52.5	Those who rule over them mock,” says the 
ISA.52.5	“and my name is blasphemed continually all day long.
ISA.52.6	Therefore my people shall know my name.
ISA.52.6	Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks.
ISA.52.6	Behold, it is I.”
ISA.52.7	How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news,
ISA.52.7	who publishes peace,
ISA.52.7	who brings good news,
ISA.52.7	who proclaims salvation,
ISA.52.7	who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”
ISA.52.8	Your watchmen lift up their voice.
ISA.52.8	Together they sing;
ISA.52.8	for they shall see eye to eye when the 
ISA.52.9	Break out into joy!
ISA.52.9	Sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem;
ISA.52.9	for the 
ISA.52.9	He has redeemed Jerusalem.
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.10	All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
ISA.52.11	Depart! Depart! Go out from there! Touch no unclean thing!
ISA.52.11	Go out from amongst her!
ISA.52.11	Cleanse yourselves, you who carry the 
ISA.52.12	For you shall not go out in haste,
ISA.52.12	neither shall you go by flight:
ISA.52.12	for the 
ISA.52.12	and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
ISA.52.13	Behold, my servant will deal wisely.
ISA.52.13	He will be exalted and lifted up,
ISA.52.13	and will be very high.
ISA.52.14	Just as many were astonished at you—
ISA.52.14	his appearance was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men—
ISA.52.15	so he will cleanse
ISA.52.15	Kings will shut their mouths at him;
ISA.52.15	for they will see that which had not been told them,
ISA.52.15	and they will understand that which they had not heard.
ISA.53.1	Who has believed our message?
ISA.53.1	To whom has the 
ISA.53.2	For he grew up before him as a tender plant,
ISA.53.2	and as a root out of dry ground.
ISA.53.2	He has no good looks or majesty.
ISA.53.2	When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
ISA.53.3	He was despised
ISA.53.3	and rejected by men,
ISA.53.3	a man of suffering
ISA.53.3	and acquainted with disease.
ISA.53.3	He was despised as one from whom men hide their face;
ISA.53.3	and we didn’t respect him.
ISA.53.4	Surely he has borne our sickness
ISA.53.4	and carried our suffering;
ISA.53.4	yet we considered him plagued,
ISA.53.4	struck by God, and afflicted.
ISA.53.5	But he was pierced for our transgressions.
ISA.53.5	He was crushed for our iniquities.
ISA.53.5	The punishment that brought our peace was on him;
ISA.53.5	and by his wounds we are healed.
ISA.53.6	All we like sheep have gone astray.
ISA.53.6	Everyone has turned to his own way;
ISA.53.6	and the 
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed,
ISA.53.7	yet when he was afflicted he didn’t open his mouth.
ISA.53.7	As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
ISA.53.7	and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
ISA.53.7	so he didn’t open his mouth.
ISA.53.8	He was taken away by oppression and judgement.
ISA.53.8	As for his generation,
ISA.53.8	who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living
ISA.53.8	and stricken for the disobedience of my people?
ISA.53.9	They made his grave with the wicked,
ISA.53.9	and with a rich man in his death,
ISA.53.9	although he had done no violence,
ISA.53.9	nor was any deceit in his mouth.
ISA.53.10	Yet it pleased the 
ISA.53.10	He has caused him to suffer.
ISA.53.10	When you make his soul an offering for sin,
ISA.53.10	he will see his offspring.
ISA.53.10	He will prolong his days
ISA.53.10	and the 
ISA.53.11	After the suffering of his soul,
ISA.53.11	he will see the light
ISA.53.11	My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;
ISA.53.11	and he will bear their iniquities.
ISA.53.12	Therefore I will give him a portion with the great.
ISA.53.12	He will divide the plunder with the strong;
ISA.53.12	because he poured out his soul to death
ISA.53.12	and was counted with the transgressors;
ISA.53.12	yet he bore the sins of many
ISA.53.12	and made intercession for the transgressors.
ISA.54.1	“Sing, barren, you who didn’t give birth;
ISA.54.1	break out into singing, and cry aloud, you who didn’t travail with child:
ISA.54.1	for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife,” says the 
ISA.54.2	“Enlarge the place of your tent,
ISA.54.2	and let them stretch out the curtains of your habitations;
ISA.54.2	don’t spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.
ISA.54.3	For you will spread out on the right hand and on the left;
ISA.54.3	and your offspring will possess the nations
ISA.54.3	and settle in desolate cities.
ISA.54.4	“Don’t be afraid, for you will not be ashamed.
ISA.54.4	Don’t be confounded, for you will not be disappointed.
ISA.54.4	For you will forget the shame of your youth.
ISA.54.4	You will remember the reproach of your widowhood no more.
ISA.54.5	For your Maker is your husband; the 
ISA.54.5	The Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer.
ISA.54.5	He will be called the God of the whole earth.
ISA.54.6	For the 
ISA.54.6	even a wife of youth, when she is cast off,” says your God.
ISA.54.7	“For a small moment I have forsaken you,
ISA.54.7	but I will gather you with great mercies.
ISA.54.8	In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment,
ISA.54.8	but with everlasting loving kindness I will have mercy on you,” says the 
ISA.54.9	“For this is like the waters of Noah to me;
ISA.54.9	for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah will no more go over the earth,
ISA.54.9	so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.
ISA.54.10	For the mountains may depart,
ISA.54.10	and the hills be removed;
ISA.54.10	but my loving kindness will not depart from you,
ISA.54.10	and my covenant of peace will not be removed,”
ISA.54.10	says the 
ISA.54.11	“You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted,
ISA.54.11	behold, I will set your stones in beautiful colours,
ISA.54.11	and lay your foundations with sapphires.
ISA.54.12	I will make your pinnacles of rubies,
ISA.54.12	your gates of sparkling jewels,
ISA.54.12	and all your walls of precious stones.
ISA.54.13	All your children will be taught by the 
ISA.54.13	and your children’s peace will be great.
ISA.54.14	You will be established in righteousness.
ISA.54.14	You will be far from oppression,
ISA.54.14	for you will not be afraid,
ISA.54.14	and far from terror,
ISA.54.14	for it shall not come near you.
ISA.54.15	Behold, they may gather together, but not by me.
ISA.54.15	Whoever gathers together against you will fall because of you.
ISA.54.16	“Behold, I have created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame,
ISA.54.16	and forges a weapon for his work;
ISA.54.16	and I have created the destroyer to destroy.
ISA.54.17	No weapon that is formed against you will prevail;
ISA.54.17	and you will condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgement.
ISA.54.17	This is the heritage of the 
ISA.54.17	and their righteousness is of me,” says the 
ISA.55.1	“Hey! Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters!
ISA.55.1	Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat!
ISA.55.1	Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
ISA.55.2	Why do you spend money for that which is not bread,
ISA.55.2	and your labour for that which doesn’t satisfy?
ISA.55.2	Listen diligently to me, and eat that which is good,
ISA.55.2	and let your soul delight itself in richness.
ISA.55.3	Turn your ear, and come to me.
ISA.55.3	Hear, and your soul will live.
ISA.55.3	I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
ISA.55.4	Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples,
ISA.55.4	a leader and commander to the peoples.
ISA.55.5	Behold, you shall call a nation that you don’t know;
ISA.55.5	and a nation that didn’t know you shall run to you,
ISA.55.5	because of the 
ISA.55.5	and for the Holy One of Israel;
ISA.55.5	for he has glorified you.”
ISA.55.6	Seek the 
ISA.55.6	Call on him while he is near.
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked forsake his way,
ISA.55.7	and the unrighteous man his thoughts.
ISA.55.7	Let him return to the 
ISA.55.7	to our God, for he will freely pardon.
ISA.55.8	“For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
ISA.55.8	and your ways are not my ways,” says the 
ISA.55.9	“For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
ISA.55.9	so are my ways higher than your ways,
ISA.55.9	and my thoughts than your thoughts.
ISA.55.10	For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,
ISA.55.10	and doesn’t return there, but waters the earth,
ISA.55.10	and makes it grow and bud,
ISA.55.10	and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
ISA.55.11	so is my word that goes out of my mouth:
ISA.55.11	it will not return to me void,
ISA.55.11	but it will accomplish that which I please,
ISA.55.11	and it will prosper in the thing I sent it to do.
ISA.55.12	For you shall go out with joy,
ISA.55.12	and be led out with peace.
ISA.55.12	The mountains and the hills will break out before you into singing;
ISA.55.12	and all the trees of the fields will clap their hands.
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thorn the cypress tree will come up;
ISA.55.13	and instead of the brier the myrtle tree will come up.
ISA.55.13	It will make a name for the 
ISA.55.13	for an everlasting sign that will not be cut off.”
ISA.56.1	The 
ISA.56.1	“Maintain justice
ISA.56.1	and do what is right,
ISA.56.1	for my salvation is near
ISA.56.1	and my righteousness will soon be revealed.
ISA.56.2	Blessed is the man who does this,
ISA.56.2	and the son of man who holds it fast;
ISA.56.2	who keeps the Sabbath without profaning it
ISA.56.2	and keeps his hand from doing any evil.”
ISA.56.3	Let no foreigner who has joined himself to the 
ISA.56.3	“The 
ISA.56.3	Do not let the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dry tree.”
ISA.56.4	For the 
ISA.56.4	choose the things that please me,
ISA.56.4	and hold fast to my covenant,
ISA.56.5	I will give them in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters.
ISA.56.5	I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.
ISA.56.6	Also the foreigners who join themselves to the 
ISA.56.6	to serve him,
ISA.56.6	and to love the 
ISA.56.6	to be his servants,
ISA.56.6	everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it,
ISA.56.6	and holds fast my covenant,
ISA.56.7	I will bring these to my holy mountain,
ISA.56.7	and make them joyful in my house of prayer.
ISA.56.7	Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar;
ISA.56.7	for my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples.”
ISA.56.8	The Lord GOD, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says,
ISA.56.8	“I will yet gather others to him,
ISA.56.8	in addition to his own who are gathered.”
ISA.56.9	All you animals of the field,
ISA.56.9	come to devour,
ISA.56.9	all you animals in the forest.
ISA.56.10	His watchmen are blind.
ISA.56.10	They are all without knowledge.
ISA.56.10	They are all mute dogs.
ISA.56.10	They can’t bark—
ISA.56.10	dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
ISA.56.11	Yes, the dogs are greedy.
ISA.56.11	They can never have enough.
ISA.56.11	They are shepherds who can’t understand.
ISA.56.11	They have all turned to their own way,
ISA.56.11	each one to his gain, from every quarter.
ISA.56.12	“Come,” they say, “I will get wine,
ISA.56.12	and we will fill ourselves with strong drink;
ISA.56.12	and tomorrow will be as today,
ISA.56.12	great beyond measure.”
ISA.57.1	The righteous perish,
ISA.57.1	and no one lays it to heart.
ISA.57.1	Merciful men are taken away,
ISA.57.1	and no one considers that the righteous is taken away from the evil.
ISA.57.2	He enters into peace.
ISA.57.2	They rest in their beds,
ISA.57.2	each one who walks in his uprightness.
ISA.57.3	“But draw near here, you sons of a sorceress,
ISA.57.3	you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes.
ISA.57.4	Whom do you mock?
ISA.57.4	Against whom do you make a wide mouth
ISA.57.4	and stick out your tongue?
ISA.57.4	Aren’t you children of disobedience
ISA.57.4	and offspring of falsehood,
ISA.57.5	you who inflame yourselves amongst the oaks,
ISA.57.5	under every green tree;
ISA.57.5	who kill the children in the valleys,
ISA.57.5	under the clefts of the rocks?
ISA.57.6	Amongst the smooth stones of the valley is your portion.
ISA.57.6	They, they are your lot.
ISA.57.6	You have even poured a drink offering to them.
ISA.57.6	You have offered an offering.
ISA.57.6	Shall I be appeased for these things?
ISA.57.7	On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed.
ISA.57.7	You also went up there to offer sacrifice.
ISA.57.8	You have set up your memorial behind the doors and the posts,
ISA.57.8	for you have exposed yourself to someone besides me,
ISA.57.8	and have gone up.
ISA.57.8	You have enlarged your bed
ISA.57.8	and made you a covenant with them.
ISA.57.8	You loved what you saw on their bed.
ISA.57.9	You went to the king with oil,
ISA.57.9	increased your perfumes,
ISA.57.9	sent your ambassadors far off,
ISA.57.9	and degraded yourself even to Sheol.
ISA.57.10	You were wearied with the length of your ways;
ISA.57.10	yet you didn’t say, ‘It is in vain.’
ISA.57.10	You found a reviving of your strength;
ISA.57.10	therefore you weren’t faint.
ISA.57.11	“Whom have you dreaded and feared,
ISA.57.11	so that you lie,
ISA.57.11	and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart?
ISA.57.11	Haven’t I held my peace for a long time,
ISA.57.11	and you don’t fear me?
ISA.57.12	I will declare your righteousness;
ISA.57.12	and as for your works, they will not benefit you.
ISA.57.13	When you cry,
ISA.57.13	let those whom you have gathered deliver you;
ISA.57.13	but the wind will take them.
ISA.57.13	a breath will carry them all away:
ISA.57.13	but he who takes refuge in me will possess the land,
ISA.57.13	and will inherit my holy mountain.”
ISA.57.14	He will say, “Build up, build up, prepare the way!
ISA.57.14	Remove the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.”
ISA.57.15	For the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity,
ISA.57.15	whose name is Holy, says:
ISA.57.15	“I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit,
ISA.57.15	to revive the spirit of the humble,
ISA.57.15	and to revive the heart of the contrite.
ISA.57.16	For I will not contend forever, neither will I always be angry;
ISA.57.16	for the spirit would faint before me,
ISA.57.16	and the souls whom I have made.
ISA.57.17	I was angry because of the iniquity of his covetousness and struck him.
ISA.57.17	I hid myself and was angry;
ISA.57.17	and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, and will heal him.
ISA.57.18	I will lead him also,
ISA.57.18	and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.
ISA.57.19	I create the fruit of the lips:
ISA.57.19	Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near,”
ISA.57.19	says the 
ISA.57.20	But the wicked are like the troubled sea;
ISA.57.20	for it can’t rest and its waters cast up mire and mud.
ISA.57.21	“There is no peace”, says my God,
ISA.57.21	“for the wicked.”
ISA.58.1	“Cry aloud! Don’t spare!
ISA.58.1	Lift up your voice like a trumpet!
ISA.58.1	Declare to my people their disobedience,
ISA.58.1	and to the house of Jacob their sins.
ISA.58.2	Yet they seek me daily,
ISA.58.2	and delight to know my ways.
ISA.58.2	As a nation that did righteousness,
ISA.58.2	and didn’t forsake the ordinance of their God,
ISA.58.2	they ask of me righteous judgements.
ISA.58.2	They delight to draw near to God.
ISA.58.3	‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and you don’t see?
ISA.58.3	Why have we afflicted our soul, and you don’t notice?’
ISA.58.3	“Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure,
ISA.58.3	and oppress all your labourers.
ISA.58.4	Behold, you fast for strife and contention,
ISA.58.4	and to strike with the fist of wickedness.
ISA.58.4	You don’t fast today so as to make your voice to be heard on high.
ISA.58.5	Is this the fast that I have chosen?
ISA.58.5	A day for a man to humble his soul?
ISA.58.5	Is it to bow down his head like a reed,
ISA.58.5	and to spread sackcloth and ashes under himself?
ISA.58.5	Will you call this a fast,
ISA.58.5	and an acceptable day to the 
ISA.58.6	“Isn’t this the fast that I have chosen:
ISA.58.6	to release the bonds of wickedness,
ISA.58.6	to undo the straps of the yoke,
ISA.58.6	to let the oppressed go free,
ISA.58.6	and that you break every yoke?
ISA.58.7	Isn’t it to distribute your bread to the hungry,
ISA.58.7	and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house?
ISA.58.7	When you see the naked,
ISA.58.7	that you cover him;
ISA.58.7	and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh?
ISA.58.8	Then your light will break out as the morning,
ISA.58.8	and your healing will appear quickly;
ISA.58.8	then your righteousness shall go before you,
ISA.58.8	and the 
ISA.58.9	Then you will call, and the 
ISA.58.9	You will cry for help, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’
ISA.58.9	“If you take away from amongst you the yoke,
ISA.58.9	finger pointing,
ISA.58.9	and speaking wickedly;
ISA.58.10	and if you pour out your soul to the hungry,
ISA.58.10	and satisfy the afflicted soul,
ISA.58.10	then your light will rise in darkness,
ISA.58.10	and your obscurity will be as the noonday;
ISA.58.11	and the 
ISA.58.11	satisfy your soul in dry places,
ISA.58.11	and make your bones strong.
ISA.58.11	You will be like a watered garden,
ISA.58.11	and like a spring of water
ISA.58.11	whose waters don’t fail.
ISA.58.12	Those who will be of you will build the old waste places.
ISA.58.12	You will raise up the foundations of many generations.
ISA.58.12	You will be called Repairer of the Breach,
ISA.58.12	Restorer of Paths with Dwellings.
ISA.58.13	“If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,
ISA.58.13	from doing your pleasure on my holy day;
ISA.58.13	and call the Sabbath a delight,
ISA.58.13	and the holy of the 
ISA.58.13	and honour it,
ISA.58.13	not doing your own ways,
ISA.58.13	nor finding your own pleasure,
ISA.58.13	nor speaking your own words,
ISA.58.14	then you will delight yourself in the 
ISA.58.14	and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth,
ISA.58.14	and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father;”
ISA.58.14	for the 
ISA.59.1	Behold, the 
ISA.59.1	nor his ear dull, that it can’t hear.
ISA.59.2	But your iniquities have separated you and your God,
ISA.59.2	and your sins have hidden his face from you,
ISA.59.2	so that he will not hear.
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood,
ISA.59.3	and your fingers with iniquity.
ISA.59.3	Your lips have spoken lies.
ISA.59.3	Your tongue mutters wickedness.
ISA.59.4	No one sues in righteousness,
ISA.59.4	and no one pleads in truth.
ISA.59.4	They trust in vanity,
ISA.59.4	and speak lies.
ISA.59.4	They conceive mischief,
ISA.59.4	and give birth to iniquity.
ISA.59.5	They hatch adders’ eggs,
ISA.59.5	and weave the spider’s web.
ISA.59.5	He who eats of their eggs dies;
ISA.59.5	and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.
ISA.59.6	Their webs won’t become garments.
ISA.59.6	They won’t cover themselves with their works.
ISA.59.6	Their works are works of iniquity,
ISA.59.6	and acts of violence are in their hands.
ISA.59.7	Their feet run to evil,
ISA.59.7	and they hurry to shed innocent blood.
ISA.59.7	Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity.
ISA.59.7	Desolation and destruction are in their paths.
ISA.59.8	They don’t know the way of peace;
ISA.59.8	and there is no justice in their ways.
ISA.59.8	They have made crooked paths for themselves;
ISA.59.8	whoever goes in them doesn’t know peace.
ISA.59.9	Therefore justice is far from us,
ISA.59.9	and righteousness doesn’t overtake us.
ISA.59.9	We look for light, but see darkness;
ISA.59.9	for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.
ISA.59.10	We grope for the wall like the blind.
ISA.59.10	Yes, we grope as those who have no eyes.
ISA.59.10	We stumble at noon as if it were twilight.
ISA.59.10	Amongst those who are strong, we are like dead men.
ISA.59.11	We all roar like bears
ISA.59.11	and moan bitterly like doves.
ISA.59.11	We look for justice, but there is none,
ISA.59.11	for salvation, but it is far off from us.
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are multiplied before you,
ISA.59.12	and our sins testify against us;
ISA.59.12	for our transgressions are with us,
ISA.59.12	and as for our iniquities, we know them:
ISA.59.13	transgressing and denying the 
ISA.59.13	and turning away from following our God,
ISA.59.13	speaking oppression and revolt,
ISA.59.13	conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
ISA.59.14	Justice is turned away backward,
ISA.59.14	and righteousness stands far away;
ISA.59.14	for truth has fallen in the street,
ISA.59.14	and uprightness can’t enter.
ISA.59.15	Yes, truth is lacking;
ISA.59.15	and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.
ISA.59.15	The 
ISA.59.15	and it displeased him that there was no justice.
ISA.59.16	He saw that there was no man,
ISA.59.16	and wondered that there was no intercessor.
ISA.59.16	Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him;
ISA.59.16	and his righteousness sustained him.
ISA.59.17	He put on righteousness as a breastplate,
ISA.59.17	and a helmet of salvation on his head.
ISA.59.17	He put on garments of vengeance for clothing,
ISA.59.17	and was clad with zeal as a mantle.
ISA.59.18	According to their deeds,
ISA.59.18	he will repay as appropriate,
ISA.59.18	wrath to his adversaries,
ISA.59.18	recompense to his enemies;
ISA.59.18	he will repay the islands their due.
ISA.59.19	So they will fear the 
ISA.59.19	and his glory from the rising of the sun;
ISA.59.19	for he will come as a rushing stream,
ISA.59.19	which the 
ISA.59.20	“A Redeemer will come to Zion,
ISA.59.20	and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob,” says the 
ISA.59.21	“As for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the 
ISA.60.1	“Arise, shine; for your light has come,
ISA.60.1	and the 
ISA.60.2	For, behold, darkness will cover the earth,
ISA.60.2	and thick darkness the peoples;
ISA.60.2	but the 
ISA.60.2	and his glory shall be seen on you.
ISA.60.3	Nations will come to your light,
ISA.60.3	and kings to the brightness of your rising.
ISA.60.4	“Lift up your eyes all around, and see:
ISA.60.4	they all gather themselves together.
ISA.60.4	They come to you.
ISA.60.4	Your sons will come from far away,
ISA.60.4	and your daughters will be carried in arms.
ISA.60.5	Then you shall see and be radiant,
ISA.60.5	and your heart will thrill and be enlarged;
ISA.60.5	because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you.
ISA.60.5	The wealth of the nations will come to you.
ISA.60.6	A multitude of camels will cover you,
ISA.60.6	the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah.
ISA.60.6	All from Sheba will come.
ISA.60.6	They will bring gold and frankincense,
ISA.60.6	and will proclaim the praises of the 
ISA.60.7	All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together to you.
ISA.60.7	The rams of Nebaioth will serve you.
ISA.60.7	They will be accepted as offerings on my altar;
ISA.60.7	and I will beautify my glorious house.
ISA.60.8	“Who are these who fly as a cloud,
ISA.60.8	and as the doves to their windows?
ISA.60.9	Surely the islands will wait for me,
ISA.60.9	and the ships of Tarshish first,
ISA.60.9	to bring your sons from far away,
ISA.60.9	their silver and their gold with them,
ISA.60.9	for the name of the 
ISA.60.9	and for the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.60.9	because he has glorified you.
ISA.60.10	“Foreigners will build up your walls,
ISA.60.10	and their kings will serve you:
ISA.60.10	for in my wrath I struck you,
ISA.60.10	but in my favour I have had mercy on you.
ISA.60.11	Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night, that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.
ISA.60.12	For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
ISA.60.13	“The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress tree, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
ISA.60.14	The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you;
ISA.60.14	and all those who despised you will bow themselves down at the soles of your feet.
ISA.60.14	They will call you the 
ISA.60.14	the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.60.15	“Whereas you have been forsaken and hated,
ISA.60.15	so that no one passed through you,
ISA.60.15	I will make you an eternal excellency,
ISA.60.15	a joy of many generations.
ISA.60.16	You will also drink the milk of the nations,
ISA.60.16	and will nurse from royal breasts.
ISA.60.16	Then you will know that I, the 
ISA.60.16	your Redeemer,
ISA.60.16	the Mighty One of Jacob.
ISA.60.17	For bronze I will bring gold;
ISA.60.17	for iron I will bring silver;
ISA.60.17	for wood, bronze,
ISA.60.17	and for stones, iron.
ISA.60.17	I will also make peace your governor,
ISA.60.17	and righteousness your ruler.
ISA.60.18	Violence shall no more be heard in your land,
ISA.60.18	nor desolation or destruction within your borders;
ISA.60.18	but you will call your walls Salvation,
ISA.60.18	and your gates Praise.
ISA.60.19	The sun will be no more your light by day;
ISA.60.19	nor will the brightness of the moon give light to you,
ISA.60.19	but the 
ISA.60.19	and your God will be your glory.
ISA.60.20	Your sun will not go down any more,
ISA.60.20	nor will your moon withdraw itself;
ISA.60.20	for the 
ISA.60.20	and the days of your mourning will end.
ISA.60.21	Then your people will all be righteous.
ISA.60.21	They will inherit the land forever,
ISA.60.21	the branch of my planting,
ISA.60.21	the work of my hands,
ISA.60.21	that I may be glorified.
ISA.60.22	The little one will become a thousand,
ISA.60.22	and the small one a strong nation.
ISA.60.22	I, the 
ISA.61.1	The Lord GOD’s Spirit is on me,
ISA.61.1	because the 
ISA.61.1	He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted,
ISA.61.1	to proclaim liberty to the captives
ISA.61.1	and release to those who are bound,
ISA.61.2	to proclaim the year of the 
ISA.61.2	and the day of vengeance of our God,
ISA.61.2	to comfort all who mourn,
ISA.61.3	to provide for those who mourn in Zion,
ISA.61.3	to give to them a garland for ashes,
ISA.61.3	the oil of joy for mourning,
ISA.61.3	the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness,
ISA.61.3	that they may be called trees of righteousness,
ISA.61.3	the planting of the 
ISA.61.3	that he may be glorified.
ISA.61.4	They will rebuild the old ruins.
ISA.61.4	They will raise up the former devastated places.
ISA.61.4	They will repair the ruined cities
ISA.61.4	that have been devastated for many generations.
ISA.61.5	Strangers will stand and feed your flocks.
ISA.61.5	Foreigners will work your fields and your vineyards.
ISA.61.6	But you will be called the 
ISA.61.6	Men will call you the servants of our God.
ISA.61.6	You will eat the wealth of the nations.
ISA.61.6	You will boast in their glory.
ISA.61.7	Instead of your shame you will have double.
ISA.61.7	Instead of dishonour, they will rejoice in their portion.
ISA.61.7	Therefore in their land they will possess double.
ISA.61.7	Everlasting joy will be to them.
ISA.61.8	“For I, the 
ISA.61.8	I hate robbery and iniquity.
ISA.61.8	I will give them their reward in truth
ISA.61.8	and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
ISA.61.9	Their offspring will be known amongst the nations,
ISA.61.9	and their offspring amongst the peoples.
ISA.61.9	All who see them will acknowledge them,
ISA.61.9	that they are the offspring which the 
ISA.61.10	I will greatly rejoice in the 
ISA.61.10	My soul will be joyful in my God,
ISA.61.10	for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation.
ISA.61.10	He has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
ISA.61.10	as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland
ISA.61.10	and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
ISA.61.11	For as the earth produces its bud,
ISA.61.11	and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring up,
ISA.61.11	so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.
ISA.62.1	For Zion’s sake I will not hold my peace,
ISA.62.1	and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest,
ISA.62.1	until her righteousness shines out like the dawn,
ISA.62.1	and her salvation like a burning lamp.
ISA.62.2	The nations will see your righteousness,
ISA.62.2	and all kings your glory.
ISA.62.2	You will be called by a new name,
ISA.62.2	which the 
ISA.62.3	You will also be a crown of beauty in the 
ISA.62.3	and a royal diadem in your God’s hand.
ISA.62.4	You will not be called Forsaken any more,
ISA.62.4	nor will your land be called Desolate any more;
ISA.62.4	but you will be called Hephzibah,
ISA.62.4	and your land Beulah;
ISA.62.4	for the 
ISA.62.4	and your land will be married.
ISA.62.5	For as a young man marries a virgin,
ISA.62.5	so your sons will marry you.
ISA.62.5	As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride,
ISA.62.5	so your God will rejoice over you.
ISA.62.6	I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem.
ISA.62.6	They will never be silent day nor night.
ISA.62.6	You who call on the 
ISA.62.7	and give him no rest, until he establishes,
ISA.62.7	and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

ISA.62.10	Go through, go through the gates!
ISA.62.10	Prepare the way of the people!
ISA.62.10	Build up, build up the highway!
ISA.62.10	Gather out the stones!

ISA.62.11	‘Behold, your salvation comes!
ISA.62.11	Behold, his reward is with him,
ISA.62.11	and his recompense before him!’”
ISA.62.12	They will call them “The Holy People,
ISA.62.12	The 
ISA.62.12	You will be called “Sought Out,
ISA.62.12	A City Not Forsaken”.
ISA.63.1	Who is this who comes from Edom,
ISA.63.1	with dyed garments from Bozrah?
ISA.63.1	Who is this who is glorious in his clothing,
ISA.63.1	marching in the greatness of his strength?
ISA.63.1	“It is I who speak in righteousness,
ISA.63.1	mighty to save.”
ISA.63.2	Why is your clothing red,
ISA.63.2	and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?
ISA.63.3	“I have trodden the wine press alone.
ISA.63.3	Of the peoples, no one was with me.
ISA.63.3	Yes, I trod them in my anger
ISA.63.3	and trampled them in my wrath.
ISA.63.3	Their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments,
ISA.63.3	and I have stained all my clothing.
ISA.63.4	For the day of vengeance was in my heart,
ISA.63.4	and the year of my redeemed has come.
ISA.63.5	I looked, and there was no one to help;
ISA.63.5	and I wondered that there was no one to uphold.
ISA.63.5	Therefore my own arm brought salvation to me.
ISA.63.5	My own wrath upheld me.
ISA.63.6	I trod down the peoples in my anger
ISA.63.6	and made them drunk in my wrath.
ISA.63.6	I poured their lifeblood out on the earth.”
ISA.63.7	I will tell of the loving kindnesses of the 
ISA.63.7	and the praises of the 
ISA.63.7	according to all that the 
ISA.63.7	and the great goodness towards the house of Israel,
ISA.63.7	which he has given to them according to his mercies,
ISA.63.7	and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
ISA.63.8	For he said, “Surely, they are my people,
ISA.63.8	children who will not deal falsely;”
ISA.63.8	so he became their Saviour.
ISA.63.9	In all their affliction he was afflicted,
ISA.63.9	and the angel of his presence saved them.
ISA.63.9	In his love and in his pity he redeemed them.
ISA.63.9	He bore them,
ISA.63.9	and carried them all the days of old.
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled
ISA.63.10	and grieved his Holy Spirit.
ISA.63.10	Therefore he turned and became their enemy,
ISA.63.10	and he himself fought against them.
ISA.63.11	Then he remembered the days of old,
ISA.63.11	Moses and his people, saying,
ISA.63.11	“Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock?
ISA.63.11	Where is he who put his Holy Spirit amongst them?”
ISA.63.12	Who caused his glorious arm to be at Moses’ right hand?
ISA.63.12	Who divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?
ISA.63.13	Who led them through the depths,
ISA.63.13	like a horse in the wilderness,
ISA.63.13	so that they didn’t stumble?
ISA.63.14	As the livestock that go down into the valley,
ISA.63.14	the 
ISA.63.14	So you led your people to make yourself a glorious name.
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven,
ISA.63.15	and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory.
ISA.63.15	Where are your zeal and your mighty acts?
ISA.63.15	The yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained towards me.
ISA.63.16	For you are our Father,
ISA.63.16	though Abraham doesn’t know us,
ISA.63.16	and Israel does not acknowledge us.
ISA.63.16	You, 
ISA.63.16	Our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.
ISA.63.17	O 
ISA.63.17	and harden our heart from your fear?
ISA.63.17	Return for your servants’ sake,
ISA.63.17	the tribes of your inheritance.
ISA.63.18	Your holy people possessed it but a little while.
ISA.63.18	Our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.
ISA.63.19	We have become like those over whom you never ruled,
ISA.63.19	like those who were not called by your name.
ISA.64.1	Oh that you would tear the heavens,
ISA.64.1	that you would come down,
ISA.64.1	that the mountains might quake at your presence.
ISA.64.2	As when fire kindles the brushwood,
ISA.64.2	and the fire causes the water to boil;
ISA.64.2	Make your name known to your adversaries,
ISA.64.2	that the nations may tremble at your presence!
ISA.64.3	When you did awesome things which we didn’t look for,
ISA.64.3	you came down, and the mountains quaked at your presence.
ISA.64.4	For from of old men have not heard,
ISA.64.4	nor perceived by the ear,
ISA.64.4	nor has the eye seen a God besides you,
ISA.64.4	who works for him who waits for him.
ISA.64.5	You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness,
ISA.64.5	those who remember you in your ways.
ISA.64.5	Behold, you were angry, and we sinned.
ISA.64.5	We have been in sin for a long time.
ISA.64.5	Shall we be saved?
ISA.64.6	For we have all become like one who is unclean,
ISA.64.6	and all our righteousness is like a polluted garment.
ISA.64.6	We all fade like a leaf;
ISA.64.6	and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
ISA.64.7	There is no one who calls on your name,
ISA.64.7	who stirs himself up to take hold of you;
ISA.64.7	for you have hidden your face from us,
ISA.64.7	and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.
ISA.64.8	But now, 
ISA.64.8	We are the clay and you our potter.
ISA.64.8	We all are the work of your hand.
ISA.64.9	Don’t be furious, 
ISA.64.9	Don’t remember iniquity forever.
ISA.64.9	Look and see, we beg you,
ISA.64.9	we are all your people.
ISA.64.10	Your holy cities have become a wilderness.
ISA.64.10	Zion has become a wilderness,
ISA.64.10	Jerusalem a desolation.
ISA.64.11	Our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised you
ISA.64.11	is burnt with fire.
ISA.64.11	All our pleasant places are laid waste.
ISA.64.12	Will you hold yourself back for these things, 
ISA.64.12	Will you keep silent and punish us very severely?
ISA.65.1	“I am enquired of by those who didn’t ask.
ISA.65.1	I am found by those who didn’t seek me.
ISA.65.1	I said, ‘See me, see me,’ to a nation that was not called by my name.
ISA.65.2	I have spread out my hands all day to a rebellious people,
ISA.65.2	who walk in a way that is not good,
ISA.65.2	after their own thoughts;
ISA.65.3	a people who provoke me to my face continually,
ISA.65.3	sacrificing in gardens,
ISA.65.3	and burning incense on bricks;
ISA.65.4	who sit amongst the graves,
ISA.65.4	and spend nights in secret places;
ISA.65.4	who eat pig’s meat,
ISA.65.4	and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
ISA.65.5	who say, ‘Stay by yourself,
ISA.65.5	don’t come near to me,
ISA.65.5	for I am holier than you.’
ISA.65.5	These are smoke in my nose,
ISA.65.5	a fire that burns all day.
ISA.65.6	“Behold, it is written before me:
ISA.65.6	I will not keep silence,
ISA.65.6	but will repay,
ISA.65.6	yes, I will repay into their bosom,
ISA.65.7	your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together”, says the 
ISA.65.7	“who have burnt incense on the mountains,
ISA.65.7	and blasphemed me on the hills.
ISA.65.7	Therefore I will first measure their work into their bosom.”
ISA.65.8	The 
ISA.65.8	“As the new wine is found in the cluster,
ISA.65.8	and one says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for a blessing is in it:’
ISA.65.8	so I will do for my servants’ sake,
ISA.65.8	that I may not destroy them all.
ISA.65.9	I will bring offspring out of Jacob,
ISA.65.9	and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains.
ISA.65.9	My chosen will inherit it,
ISA.65.9	and my servants will dwell there.
ISA.65.10	Sharon will be a fold of flocks,
ISA.65.10	and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in,
ISA.65.10	for my people who have sought me.
ISA.65.11	“But you who forsake the 
ISA.65.11	who forget my holy mountain,
ISA.65.11	who prepare a table for Fortune,
ISA.65.11	and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;
ISA.65.12	I will destine you to the sword,
ISA.65.12	and you will all bow down to the slaughter;
ISA.65.12	because when I called, you didn’t answer.
ISA.65.12	When I spoke, you didn’t listen;
ISA.65.12	but you did that which was evil in my eyes,
ISA.65.12	and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”
ISA.65.13	Therefore the Lord GOD says,
ISA.65.13	“Behold, my servants will eat,
ISA.65.13	but you will be hungry;
ISA.65.13	behold, my servants will drink,
ISA.65.13	but you will be thirsty.
ISA.65.13	Behold, my servants will rejoice,
ISA.65.13	but you will be disappointed;
ISA.65.14	Behold, my servants will sing for joy of heart,
ISA.65.14	but you will cry for sorrow of heart,
ISA.65.14	and will wail for anguish of spirit.
ISA.65.15	You will leave your name for a curse to my chosen;
ISA.65.15	and the Lord GOD will kill you.
ISA.65.15	He will call his servants by another name,
ISA.65.16	so that he who blesses himself in the earth will bless himself in the God of truth;
ISA.65.16	and he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth;
ISA.65.16	because the former troubles are forgotten,
ISA.65.16	and because they are hidden from my eyes.
ISA.65.17	“For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth;
ISA.65.17	and the former things will not be remembered,
ISA.65.17	nor come into mind.
ISA.65.18	But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create;
ISA.65.18	for, behold, I create Jerusalem to be a delight,
ISA.65.18	and her people a joy.
ISA.65.19	I will rejoice in Jerusalem,
ISA.65.19	and delight in my people;
ISA.65.19	and the voice of weeping and the voice of crying
ISA.65.19	will be heard in her no more.
ISA.65.20	“No more will there be an infant who only lives a few days,
ISA.65.20	nor an old man who has not filled his days;
ISA.65.20	for the child will die one hundred years old,
ISA.65.20	and the sinner being one hundred years old will be accursed.
ISA.65.21	They will build houses and inhabit them.
ISA.65.21	They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
ISA.65.22	They will not build and another inhabit.
ISA.65.22	They will not plant and another eat:
ISA.65.22	for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,
ISA.65.22	and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands.
ISA.65.23	They will not labour in vain
ISA.65.23	nor give birth for calamity;
ISA.65.23	for they are the offspring of the 
ISA.65.23	and their descendants with them.
ISA.65.24	It will happen that before they call, I will answer;
ISA.65.24	and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb will feed together.
ISA.65.25	The lion will eat straw like the ox.
ISA.65.25	Dust will be the serpent’s food.
ISA.65.25	They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,”
ISA.65.25	says the 
ISA.66.1	The 
ISA.66.1	“Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.
ISA.66.1	What kind of house will you build to me?
ISA.66.1	Where will I rest?
ISA.66.2	For my hand has made all these things,
ISA.66.2	and so all these things came to be,” says the 
ISA.66.2	“but I will look to this man,
ISA.66.2	even to he who is poor and of a contrite spirit,
ISA.66.2	and who trembles at my word.
ISA.66.3	He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man;
ISA.66.3	he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog’s neck;
ISA.66.3	he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig’s blood;
ISA.66.3	he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol.
ISA.66.3	Yes, they have chosen their own ways,
ISA.66.3	and their soul delights in their abominations:
ISA.66.4	I also will choose their delusions,
ISA.66.4	and will bring their fears on them;
ISA.66.4	because when I called, no one answered;
ISA.66.4	when I spoke, they didn’t listen;
ISA.66.4	but they did that which was evil in my eyes,
ISA.66.4	and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”
ISA.66.5	Hear the 
ISA.66.5	you who tremble at his word:
ISA.66.5	“Your brothers who hate you,
ISA.66.5	who cast you out for my name’s sake, have said,
ISA.66.5	‘Let the 
ISA.66.5	that we may see your joy;’
ISA.66.5	but it is those who shall be disappointed.
ISA.66.6	A voice of tumult from the city,
ISA.66.6	a voice from the temple,
ISA.66.6	a voice of the 
ISA.66.7	“Before she travailed, she gave birth.
ISA.66.7	Before her pain came, she delivered a son.
ISA.66.8	Who has heard of such a thing?
ISA.66.8	Who has seen such things?
ISA.66.8	Shall a land be born in one day?
ISA.66.8	Shall a nation be born at once?
ISA.66.8	For as soon as Zion travailed,
ISA.66.8	she gave birth to her children.
ISA.66.9	Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to be delivered?” says the 
ISA.66.9	“Shall I who cause to give birth shut the womb?” says your God.
ISA.66.10	“Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her.
ISA.66.10	Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;
ISA.66.11	that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts;
ISA.66.11	that you may drink deeply,
ISA.66.11	and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.”
ISA.66.12	For the 
ISA.66.12	and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream;
ISA.66.12	and you will nurse.
ISA.66.12	You will be carried on her side,
ISA.66.12	and will be dandled on her knees.
ISA.66.13	As one whom his mother comforts,
ISA.66.13	so I will comfort you.
ISA.66.13	You will be comforted in Jerusalem.”
ISA.66.14	You will see it, and your heart shall rejoice,
ISA.66.14	and your bones will flourish like the tender grass.
ISA.66.14	The 
ISA.66.14	and he will have indignation against his enemies.
ISA.66.15	For, behold, the 
ISA.66.15	and his chariots will be like the whirlwind;
ISA.66.15	to render his anger with fierceness,
ISA.66.15	and his rebuke with flames of fire.
ISA.66.16	For the 
ISA.66.16	and those slain by the 
ISA.66.17	“Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, behind one in the middle, eating pig’s meat, abominable things, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together,” says the 
ISA.66.18	“For I know their works and their thoughts. The time comes that I will gather all nations and languages, and they will come, and will see my glory.
ISA.66.19	“I will set a sign amongst them, and I will send those who escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to far-away islands, who have not heard my fame, nor have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory amongst the nations. 
ISA.66.20	They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering to the 
ISA.66.21	Of them I will also select priests and Levites,” says the 
ISA.66.22	“For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me,” says the 
ISA.66.23	It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,” says the 
ISA.66.24	“They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”
JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. 
JER.1.2	The 
JER.1.3	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. 
JER.1.4	Now the 
JER.1.5	“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.
JER.1.5	Before you were born, I sanctified you.
JER.1.5	I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.”
JER.1.6	Then I said, “Ah, Lord
JER.1.7	But the 
JER.1.8	Don’t be afraid because of them, for I am with you to rescue you,” says the 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.10	Behold, I have today set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”
JER.1.11	Moreover the 
JER.1.11	I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”
JER.1.12	Then the 
JER.1.13	The 
JER.1.13	I said, “I see a boiling cauldron; and it is tipping away from the north.”
JER.1.14	Then the 
JER.1.15	For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says the 
JER.1.15	“They will come, and they will each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,
JER.1.15	and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.
JER.1.16	I will utter my judgements against them concerning all their wickedness,
JER.1.16	in that they have forsaken me,
JER.1.16	and have burnt incense to other gods,
JER.1.16	and worshipped the works of their own hands.
JER.1.17	“You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and say to them all that I command you. Don’t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them. 
JER.1.18	For, behold, I have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. 
JER.1.19	They will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you”, says the 
JER.2.1	The 
JER.2.2	“Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘The 
JER.2.2	“I remember for you the kindness of your youth,
JER.2.2	the love of your weddings;
JER.2.2	how you went after me in the wilderness,
JER.2.2	in a land that was not sown.
JER.2.3	Israel was holiness to the 
JER.2.3	the first fruits of his increase.
JER.2.3	All who devour him will be held guilty.
JER.2.3	Evil will come on them,”’ says the 
JER.2.4	Hear the 
JER.2.5	The 
JER.2.5	“What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,
JER.2.5	that they have gone far from me,
JER.2.5	and have walked after worthless vanity,
JER.2.5	and have become worthless?
JER.2.6	They didn’t say, ‘Where is the 
JER.2.6	who led us through the wilderness,
JER.2.6	through a land of deserts and of pits,
JER.2.6	through a land of drought and of the shadow of death,
JER.2.6	through a land that no one passed through,
JER.2.6	and where no man lived?’
JER.2.7	I brought you into a plentiful land
JER.2.7	to eat its fruit and its goodness;
JER.2.7	but when you entered, you defiled my land,
JER.2.7	and made my heritage an abomination.
JER.2.8	The priests didn’t say, ‘Where is the 
JER.2.8	and those who handle the law didn’t know me.
JER.2.8	The rulers also transgressed against me,
JER.2.8	and the prophets prophesied by Baal
JER.2.8	and followed things that do not profit.
JER.2.9	“Therefore I will yet contend with you,” says the 
JER.2.9	“and I will contend with your children’s children.
JER.2.10	For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see.
JER.2.10	Send to Kedar, and consider diligently,
JER.2.10	and see if there has been such a thing.
JER.2.11	Has a nation changed its gods,
JER.2.11	which really are no gods?
JER.2.11	But my people have changed their glory for that which doesn’t profit.
JER.2.12	“Be astonished, you heavens, at this
JER.2.12	and be horribly afraid.
JER.2.12	Be very desolate,” says the 
JER.2.13	“For my people have committed two evils:
JER.2.13	they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters,
JER.2.13	and cut out cisterns for themselves: broken cisterns that can’t hold water.
JER.2.14	Is Israel a slave?
JER.2.14	Is he born into slavery?
JER.2.14	Why has he become a captive?
JER.2.15	The young lions have roared at him and yelled.
JER.2.15	They have made his land waste.
JER.2.15	His cities are burnt up, without inhabitant.
JER.2.16	The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.
JER.2.17	“Haven’t you brought this on yourself,
JER.2.17	in that you have forsaken the 
JER.2.18	Now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor?
JER.2.18	Or why do you to go on the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
JER.2.19	“Your own wickedness will correct you,
JER.2.19	and your backsliding will rebuke you.
JER.2.19	Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing,
JER.2.19	that you have forsaken the 
JER.2.19	and that my fear is not in you,” says the Lord, the 
JER.2.20	“For long ago I broke off your yoke,
JER.2.20	and burst your bonds.
JER.2.20	You said, ‘I will not serve;’
JER.2.20	for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself,
JER.2.20	playing the prostitute.
JER.2.21	Yet I had planted you a noble vine,
JER.2.21	a pure and faithful seed.
JER.2.21	How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?
JER.2.22	For though you wash yourself with lye,
JER.2.22	and use much soap,
JER.2.22	yet your iniquity is marked before me,” says the Lord GOD.
JER.2.23	“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled.
JER.2.23	I have not gone after the Baals’?
JER.2.23	See your way in the valley.
JER.2.23	Know what you have done.
JER.2.23	You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways, 
JER.2.24	a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs the wind in her craving.
JER.2.24	When she is in heat, who can turn her away?
JER.2.24	All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her.
JER.2.25	“Keep your feet from being bare,
JER.2.25	and your throat from thirst.
JER.2.25	But you said, ‘It is in vain.
JER.2.25	No, for I have loved strangers,
JER.2.25	and I will go after them.’
JER.2.26	As the thief is ashamed when he is found,
JER.2.26	so the house of Israel is ashamed:
JER.2.26	they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets,
JER.2.27	who tell wood, ‘You are my father,’
JER.2.27	and a stone, ‘You have given birth to me,’
JER.2.27	for they have turned their back to me,
JER.2.27	and not their face;
JER.2.27	but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us!’
JER.2.28	“But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves?
JER.2.28	Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble;
JER.2.28	for you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.
JER.2.29	“Why will you contend with me?
JER.2.29	You all have transgressed against me,” says the 
JER.2.30	“I have struck your children in vain.
JER.2.30	They received no correction.
JER.2.30	Your own sword has devoured your prophets,
JER.2.30	like a destroying lion.
JER.2.31	Generation, consider the 
JER.2.31	Have I been a wilderness to Israel?
JER.2.31	Or a land of thick darkness?
JER.2.31	Why do my people say, ‘We have broken loose.
JER.2.31	We will come to you no more’?
JER.2.32	“Can a virgin forget her ornaments,
JER.2.32	or a bride her attire?
JER.2.32	Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number.
JER.2.33	How well you prepare your way to seek love!
JER.2.33	Therefore you have even taught the wicked women your ways.
JER.2.34	Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts.
JER.2.34	You didn’t find them breaking in,
JER.2.34	but it is because of all these things.
JER.2.35	“Yet you said, ‘I am innocent.
JER.2.35	Surely his anger has turned away from me.’
JER.2.35	“Behold, I will judge you,
JER.2.35	because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’
JER.2.36	Why do you go about so much to change your ways?
JER.2.36	You will be ashamed of Egypt also,
JER.2.36	as you were ashamed of Assyria.
JER.2.37	You will also leave that place with your hands on your head;
JER.2.37	for the 
JER.2.37	and you won’t prosper with them.
JER.3.1	“They say, ‘If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and becomes another man’s, should he return to her again?’ Wouldn’t that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me,” says the 
JER.3.2	“Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? You have sat waiting for them by the road, as an Arabian in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness. 
JER.3.3	Therefore the showers have been withheld and there has been no latter rain; yet you have had a prostitute’s forehead and you refused to be ashamed. 
JER.3.4	Will you not from this time cry to me, ‘My Father, you are the guide of my youth!’?
JER.3.5	“‘Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end?’ Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.”
JER.3.6	Moreover, the 
JER.3.7	I said after she had done all these things, ‘She will return to me;’ but she didn’t return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. 
JER.3.8	I saw when, for this very cause, that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a certificate of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, had no fear; but she also went and played the prostitute. 
JER.3.9	Because she took her prostitution lightly, the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with wood. 
JER.3.10	Yet for all this her treacherous sister, Judah, has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in pretence,” says the 
JER.3.11	The 
JER.3.12	Go, and proclaim these words towards the north, and say, ‘Return, you backsliding Israel,’ says the 
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against the 
JER.3.14	“Return, backsliding children,” says the 
JER.3.15	I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding. 
JER.3.16	It will come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days,” says the 
JER.3.17	At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The 
JER.3.18	In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.
JER.3.19	“But I said, ‘How I desire to put you amongst the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!’ and I said, ‘You shall call me “My Father”, and shall not turn away from following me.’
JER.3.20	“Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel,” says the 
JER.3.21	A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the 
JER.3.22	Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backsliding.
JER.3.22	“Behold, we have come to you; for you are the 
JER.3.23	Truly help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains, is in vain. Truly the salvation of Israel is in the 
JER.3.24	But the shameful thing has devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
JER.3.25	Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against the 
JER.4.1	“If you will return, Israel,” says the 
JER.4.2	and you will swear, ‘As the 
JER.4.3	For the 
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to the 
JER.4.5	Declare in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, ‘Blow the trumpet in the land!’ Cry aloud and say, ‘Assemble yourselves! Let’s go into the fortified cities!’ 
JER.4.6	Set up a standard towards Zion. Flee for safety! Don’t wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.”
JER.4.7	A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations. He is on his way. He has gone out from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant. 
JER.4.8	For this, clothe yourself with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of the 
JER.4.9	“It will happen at that day,” says the 
JER.4.10	Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You will have peace;’ whereas the sword reaches to the heart.”
JER.4.11	At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness towards the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse; 
JER.4.12	a full wind from these will come for me. Now I will also utter judgements against them.”
JER.4.13	Behold, he will come up as clouds, and his chariots will be as the whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined. 
JER.4.14	Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long will your evil thoughts lodge within you? 
JER.4.15	For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim: 
JER.4.16	“Tell the nations, behold, publish against Jerusalem, ‘Watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah. 
JER.4.17	As keepers of a field, they are against her all around, because she has been rebellious against me,’” says the 
JER.4.18	“Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.”
JER.4.19	My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart! My heart trembles within me. I can’t hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. 
JER.4.20	Destruction on destruction is decreed, for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, and my curtains gone in a moment. 
JER.4.21	How long will I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
JER.4.22	“For my people are foolish. They don’t know me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skilful in doing evil, but they don’t know how to do good.” 
JER.4.23	I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void, and the heavens, and they had no light. 
JER.4.24	I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth. 
JER.4.25	I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky had fled. 
JER.4.26	I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the 
JER.4.27	For the 
JER.4.28	For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black, because I have spoken it. I have planned it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.”
JER.4.29	Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers. They go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks. Every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein. 
JER.4.30	You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with makeup, you make yourself beautiful in vain. Your lovers despise you. They seek your life. 
JER.4.31	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who gives birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, “Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers.”
JER.5.1	“Run back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its wide places, if you can find a man, if there is anyone who does justly, who seeks truth, then I will pardon her. 
JER.5.2	Though they say, ‘As the 
JER.5.3	O 
JER.5.4	Then I said, “Surely these are poor. They are foolish; for they don’t know the 
JER.5.5	I will go to the great men and will speak to them, for they know the way of the 
JER.5.6	Therefore a lion out of the forest will kill them. A wolf of the evenings will destroy them. A leopard will watch against their cities. Everyone who goes out there will be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many and their backsliding has increased.
JER.5.7	“How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me, and sworn by what are no gods. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes’ houses. 
JER.5.8	They were as fed horses roaming at large. Everyone neighed after his neighbour’s wife. 
JER.5.9	Shouldn’t I punish them for these things?” says the 
JER.5.10	“Go up on her walls, and destroy; but don’t make a full end. Take away her branches, for they are not the 
JER.5.11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me,” says the 
JER.5.12	They have denied the 
JER.5.13	The prophets will become wind, and the word is not in them. Thus it will be done to them.”
JER.5.14	Therefore the 
JER.5.15	Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far away, house of Israel,” says the 
JER.5.16	Their quiver is an open tomb. They are all mighty men. 
JER.5.17	They will eat up your harvest and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat. They will eat up your flocks and your herds. They will eat up your vines and your fig trees. They will beat down your fortified cities in which you trust with the sword.
JER.5.18	“But even in those days,” says the 
JER.5.19	It will happen when you say, ‘Why has the 
JER.5.20	“Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, 
JER.5.21	‘Hear this now, foolish people without understanding, who have eyes, and don’t see, who have ears, and don’t hear: 
JER.5.22	Don’t you fear me?’ says the 
JER.5.23	“But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart. They have revolted and gone. 
JER.5.24	They don’t say in their heart, ‘Let’s now fear the 
JER.5.25	“Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you. 
JER.5.26	For wicked men are found amongst my people. They watch, as fowlers lie in wait. They set a trap. They catch men. 
JER.5.27	As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit. Therefore they have become great, and grew rich. 
JER.5.28	They have grown fat. They shine; yes, they excel in deeds of wickedness. They don’t plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and they don’t defend the rights of the needy.
JER.5.29	“Shouldn’t I punish for these things?” says the 
JER.5.30	“An astonishing and horrible thing has happened in the land. 
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority; and my people love to have it so. What will you do in the end of it?
JER.6.1	“Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the middle of Jerusalem! Blow the trumpet in Tekoa and raise up a signal on Beth Haccherem, for evil looks out from the north with a great destruction. 
JER.6.2	I will cut off the beautiful and delicate one, the daughter of Zion. 
JER.6.3	Shepherds with their flocks will come to her. They will pitch their tents against her all around. They will feed everyone in his place.”
JER.6.4	“Prepare war against her! Arise! Let’s go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. 
JER.6.5	Arise! Let’s go up by night, and let’s destroy her palaces.” 
JER.6.6	For the 
JER.6.7	As a well produces its waters, so she produces her wickedness. Violence and destruction is heard in her. Sickness and wounds are continually before me. 
JER.6.8	Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you, lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land.”
JER.6.9	The 
JER.6.10	To whom should I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can’t listen. Behold, the 
JER.6.11	Therefore I am full of the 
JER.6.11	“Pour it out on the children in the street,
JER.6.11	and on the assembly of young men together;
JER.6.11	for even the husband with the wife will be taken,
JER.6.11	the aged with him who is full of days.
JER.6.12	Their houses will be turned to others,
JER.6.12	their fields and their wives together;
JER.6.12	for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says the 
JER.6.13	“For from their least even to their greatest, everyone is given to covetousness.
JER.6.13	From the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely.
JER.6.14	They have healed also the hurt of my people superficially,
JER.6.14	saying, ‘Peace, peace!’ when there is no peace.
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?
JER.6.15	No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.
JER.6.15	Therefore they will fall amongst those who fall.
JER.6.15	When I visit them, they will be cast down,” says the 
JER.6.16	The 
JER.6.17	I set watchmen over you, saying, ‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’ But they said, ‘We will not listen!’ 
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is amongst them. 
JER.6.19	Hear, earth! Behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it. 
JER.6.20	To what purpose does frankincense from Sheba come to me, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices are not pleasing to me.”
JER.6.21	Therefore The 
JER.6.22	The 
JER.6.23	They take hold of bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Zion.”
JER.6.24	We have heard its report. Our hands become feeble. Anguish has taken hold of us, and pains as of a woman in labour. 
JER.6.25	Don’t go out into the field or walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and terror are on every side. 
JER.6.26	Daughter of my people, clothe yourself with sackcloth, and wallow in ashes! Mourn, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation, for the destroyer will suddenly come on us.
JER.6.27	“I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress amongst my people, that you may know and try their way. 
JER.6.28	They are all grievous rebels, going around to slander. They are bronze and iron. All of them deal corruptly. 
JER.6.29	The bellows blow fiercely. The lead is consumed in the fire. In vain they go on refining, for the wicked are not plucked away. 
JER.6.30	Men will call them rejected silver, because the 
JER.7.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.7.2	“Stand in the gate of the 
JER.7.3	The 
JER.7.4	Don’t trust in lying words, saying, ‘The 
JER.7.5	For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbour; 
JER.7.6	if you don’t oppress the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, and don’t shed innocent blood in this place, and don’t walk after other gods to your own hurt; 
JER.7.7	then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even forever more. 
JER.7.8	Behold, you trust in lying words that can’t profit. 
JER.7.9	Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods that you have not known, 
JER.7.10	then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, ‘We are delivered,’ that you may do all these abominations? 
JER.7.11	Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have seen it,” says the 
JER.7.12	“But go now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. 
JER.7.13	Now, because you have done all these works,” says the 
JER.7.14	therefore I will do to the house which is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. 
JER.7.15	I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole offspring
JER.7.16	“Therefore don’t pray for this people. Don’t lift up a cry or prayer for them or make intercession to me; for I will not hear you. 
JER.7.17	Don’t you see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger. 
JER.7.19	Do they provoke me to anger?” says the 
JER.7.20	Therefore the Lord GOD says: “Behold, my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, on man, on animal, on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and will not be quenched.”
JER.7.21	the 
JER.7.22	For I didn’t speak to your fathers or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices; 
JER.7.23	but this thing I commanded them, saying, ‘Listen to my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. Walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.’ 
JER.7.24	But they didn’t listen or turn their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward. 
JER.7.25	Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them. 
JER.7.26	Yet they didn’t listen to me or incline their ear, but made their neck stiff. They did worse than their fathers.
JER.7.27	“You shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall also call to them, but they will not answer you. 
JER.7.28	You shall tell them, ‘This is the nation that has not listened to the 
JER.7.29	Cut off your hair, and throw it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for the 
JER.7.30	“For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight,” says the 
JER.7.31	They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I didn’t command, nor did it come into my mind. 
JER.7.32	Therefore behold, the days come”, says the 
JER.7.33	The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth. No one will frighten them away. 
JER.7.34	Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a waste.”
JER.8.1	“At that time,” says the 
JER.8.2	They will spread them before the sun, the moon, and all the army of the sky, which they have loved, which they have served, after which they have walked, which they have sought, and which they have worshipped. They will not be gathered or be buried. They will be like dung on the surface of the earth. 
JER.8.3	Death will be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them,” says the 
JER.8.4	“Moreover you shall tell them, ‘The 
JER.8.4	“‘Do men fall, and not rise up again?
JER.8.4	Does one turn away, and not return?
JER.8.5	Why then have the people of Jerusalem fallen back by a perpetual backsliding?
JER.8.5	They cling to deceit.
JER.8.5	They refuse to return.
JER.8.6	I listened and heard, but they didn’t say what is right.
JER.8.6	No one repents of his wickedness, saying, “What have I done?”
JER.8.6	Everyone turns to his course,
JER.8.6	as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle.
JER.8.7	Yes, the stork in the sky knows her appointed times.
JER.8.7	The turtledove, the swallow, and the crane observe the time of their coming;
JER.8.7	but my people don’t know the 
JER.8.8	“‘How do you say, “We are wise, and the 
JER.8.8	But, behold, the false pen of the scribes has made that a lie.
JER.8.9	The wise men are disappointed.
JER.8.9	They are dismayed and trapped.
JER.8.9	Behold, they have rejected the 
JER.8.9	What kind of wisdom is in them?
JER.8.10	Therefore I will give their wives to others
JER.8.10	and their fields to those who will possess them.
JER.8.10	For everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness;
JER.8.10	from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.
JER.8.11	They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying,
JER.8.11	“Peace, peace,” when there is no peace.
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?
JER.8.12	No, they were not at all ashamed.
JER.8.12	They couldn’t blush.
JER.8.12	Therefore they will fall amongst those who fall.
JER.8.12	In the time of their visitation they will be cast down, says the 
JER.8.13	“‘I will utterly consume them, says the 
JER.8.13	No grapes will be on the vine,
JER.8.13	no figs on the fig tree,
JER.8.13	and the leaf will fade.
JER.8.13	The things that I have given them
JER.8.13	will pass away from them.’”
JER.8.14	“Why do we sit still?
JER.8.14	Assemble yourselves!
JER.8.14	Let’s enter into the fortified cities,
JER.8.14	and let’s be silent there;
JER.8.14	for the 
JER.8.14	and given us poisoned water to drink,
JER.8.14	because we have sinned against the 
JER.8.15	We looked for peace, but no good came;
JER.8.15	and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!
JER.8.16	The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan.
JER.8.16	The whole land trembles at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones;
JER.8.16	for they have come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it,
JER.8.16	the city and those who dwell therein.”
JER.8.17	“For, behold, I will send serpents,
JER.8.17	adders amongst you,
JER.8.17	which will not be charmed;
JER.8.17	and they will bite you,” says the 
JER.8.18	Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow!
JER.8.18	My heart is faint within me.
JER.8.19	Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off:
JER.8.19	“Isn’t the 
JER.8.19	Isn’t her King in her?”
JER.8.19	“Why have they provoked me to anger with their engraved images,
JER.8.19	and with foreign idols?”
JER.8.20	“The harvest is past.
JER.8.20	The summer has ended,
JER.8.20	and we are not saved.”
JER.8.21	For the hurt of the daughter of my people, I am hurt.
JER.8.21	I mourn.
JER.8.21	Dismay has taken hold of me.
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in Gilead?
JER.8.22	Is there no physician there?
JER.8.22	Why then isn’t the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
JER.9.1	Oh that my head were waters,
JER.9.1	and my eyes a spring of tears,
JER.9.1	that I might weep day and night
JER.9.1	for the slain of the daughter of my people!
JER.9.2	Oh that I had in the wilderness
JER.9.2	a lodging place of wayfaring men;
JER.9.2	that I might leave my people,
JER.9.2	and go from them!
JER.9.2	For they are all adulterers,
JER.9.2	an assembly of treacherous men.
JER.9.3	“They bend their tongue,
JER.9.3	as their bow, for falsehood.
JER.9.3	They have grown strong in the land,
JER.9.3	but not for truth;
JER.9.3	for they proceed from evil to evil,
JER.9.3	and they don’t know me,” says the 
JER.9.4	“Everyone beware of his neighbour,
JER.9.4	and don’t trust in any brother;
JER.9.4	for every brother will utterly supplant,
JER.9.4	and every neighbour will go around like a slanderer.
JER.9.5	Friends deceive each other,
JER.9.5	and will not speak the truth.
JER.9.5	They have taught their tongue to speak lies.
JER.9.5	They weary themselves commiting iniquity.
JER.9.6	Your habitation is in the middle of deceit.
JER.9.6	Through deceit, they refuse to know me,” says the 
JER.9.7	Therefore the 
JER.9.7	“Behold, I will melt them and test them;
JER.9.7	for how should I deal with the daughter of my people?
JER.9.8	Their tongue is a deadly arrow.
JER.9.8	It speaks deceit.
JER.9.8	One speaks peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth,
JER.9.8	but in his heart, he waits to ambush him.
JER.9.9	Shouldn’t I punish them for these things?” says the 
JER.9.9	“Shouldn’t my soul be avenged on a nation such as this?
JER.9.10	I will weep and wail for the mountains,
JER.9.10	and lament for the pastures of the wilderness,
JER.9.10	because they are burnt up, so that no one passes through;
JER.9.10	Men can’t hear the voice of the livestock.
JER.9.10	Both the birds of the sky and the animals have fled.
JER.9.10	They are gone.
JER.9.11	“I will make Jerusalem heaps,
JER.9.11	a dwelling place of jackals.
JER.9.11	I will make the cities of Judah a desolation,
JER.9.11	without inhabitant.”
JER.9.12	Who is wise enough to understand this? Who is he to whom the mouth of the 
JER.9.13	The 
JER.9.14	but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them.” 
JER.9.15	Therefore the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them also amongst the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”
JER.9.17	The 
JER.9.17	“Consider, and call for the mourning women, that they may come.
JER.9.17	Send for the skilful women, that they may come.
JER.9.18	Let them make haste
JER.9.18	and take up a wailing for us,
JER.9.18	that our eyes may run down with tears
JER.9.18	and our eyelids gush out with waters.
JER.9.19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion,
JER.9.19	‘How we are ruined!
JER.9.19	We are greatly confounded
JER.9.19	because we have forsaken the land,
JER.9.19	because they have cast down our dwellings.’”
JER.9.20	Yet hear the 
JER.9.20	Let your ear receive the word of his mouth.
JER.9.20	Teach your daughters wailing.
JER.9.20	Everyone teach her neighbour a lamentation.
JER.9.21	For death has come up into our windows.
JER.9.21	It has entered into our palaces
JER.9.21	to cut off the children from outside,
JER.9.21	and the young men from the streets.
JER.9.22	Speak, “The 
JER.9.22	“‘The dead bodies of men will fall as dung on the open field,
JER.9.22	and as the handful after the harvester.
JER.9.22	No one will gather them.’”

JER.9.23	“Don’t let the wise man glory in his wisdom.
JER.9.23	Don’t let the mighty man glory in his might.
JER.9.23	Don’t let the rich man glory in his riches.
JER.9.24	But let him who glories glory in this,
JER.9.24	that he has understanding, and knows me,
JER.9.24	that I am the 
JER.9.24	for I delight in these things,” says the 
JER.9.25	“Behold, the days come,” says the 
JER.9.26	Egypt, Judah, Edom, the children of Ammon, Moab, and all who have the corners of their hair cut off, who dwell in the wilderness, for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.”
JER.10.1	Hear the word which the 
JER.10.2	The 
JER.10.2	“Don’t learn the way of the nations,
JER.10.2	and don’t be dismayed at the signs of the sky;
JER.10.2	for the nations are dismayed at them.
JER.10.3	For the customs of the peoples are vanity;
JER.10.3	for one cuts a tree out of the forest,
JER.10.3	the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.
JER.10.4	They deck it with silver and with gold.
JER.10.4	They fasten it with nails and with hammers,
JER.10.4	so that it can’t move.
JER.10.5	They are like a palm tree, of turned work,
JER.10.5	and don’t speak.
JER.10.5	They must be carried,
JER.10.5	because they can’t move.
JER.10.5	Don’t be afraid of them;
JER.10.5	for they can’t do evil,
JER.10.5	neither is it in them to do good.”
JER.10.6	There is no one like you, 
JER.10.6	You are great,
JER.10.6	and your name is great in might.
JER.10.7	Who shouldn’t fear you,
JER.10.7	King of the nations?
JER.10.7	For it belongs to you.
JER.10.7	Because amongst all the wise men of the nations,
JER.10.7	and in all their royal estate,
JER.10.7	there is no one like you.
JER.10.8	But they are together brutish and foolish,
JER.10.8	instructed by idols!
JER.10.8	It is just wood.
JER.10.9	There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish,
JER.10.9	and gold from Uphaz,
JER.10.9	the work of the engraver and of the hands of the goldsmith.
JER.10.9	Their clothing is blue and purple.
JER.10.9	They are all the work of skilful men.
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.10	He is the living God,
JER.10.10	and an everlasting King.
JER.10.10	At his wrath, the earth trembles.
JER.10.10	The nations aren’t able to withstand his indignation.
JER.10.11	“You shall say this to them: ‘The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.’”
JER.10.12	God has made the earth by his power.
JER.10.12	He has established the world by his wisdom,
JER.10.12	and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens.
JER.10.13	When he utters his voice,
JER.10.13	the waters in the heavens roar,
JER.10.13	and he causes the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth.
JER.10.13	He makes lightnings for the rain,
JER.10.13	and brings the wind out of his treasuries.
JER.10.14	Every man has become brutish and without knowledge.
JER.10.14	Every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image;
JER.10.14	for his molten image is falsehood,
JER.10.14	and there is no breath in them.
JER.10.15	They are vanity, a work of delusion.
JER.10.15	In the time of their visitation they will perish.
JER.10.16	The portion of Jacob is not like these;
JER.10.16	for he is the maker of all things;
JER.10.16	and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance:
JER.10.16	the 
JER.10.17	Gather up your wares out of the land,
JER.10.17	you who live under siege.
JER.10.18	For the 
JER.10.18	“Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time,
JER.10.18	and will distress them, that they may feel it.”
JER.10.19	Woe is me because of my injury!
JER.10.19	My wound is serious;
JER.10.19	but I said,
JER.10.19	“Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.”
JER.10.20	My tent has been destroyed,
JER.10.20	and all my cords are broken.
JER.10.20	My children have gone away from me, and they are no more.
JER.10.20	There is no one to spread my tent any more,
JER.10.20	to set up my curtains.
JER.10.21	For the shepherds have become brutish,
JER.10.21	and have not enquired of the 
JER.10.21	Therefore they have not prospered,
JER.10.21	and all their flocks have scattered.
JER.10.22	The voice of news, behold, it comes,
JER.10.22	and a great commotion out of the north country,
JER.10.22	to make the cities of Judah a desolation,
JER.10.22	a dwelling place of jackals.
JER.10.23	, I know that the way of man is not in himself.
JER.10.23	It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
JER.10.24	, correct me, but gently;
JER.10.24	not in your anger,
JER.10.24	lest you reduce me to nothing.
JER.10.25	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,
JER.10.25	and on the families that don’t call on your name;
JER.10.25	for they have devoured Jacob.
JER.10.25	Yes, they have devoured him, consumed him,
JER.10.25	and have laid waste his habitation.
JER.11.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.11.2	“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 
JER.11.3	and say to them, the 
JER.11.4	which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace,’ saying, ‘Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you; so you shall be my people, and I will be your God; 
JER.11.5	that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,’ as it is today.”
JER.11.5	Then I answered, and said, “Amen, 
JER.11.6	The 
JER.11.7	For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, “Obey my voice.” 
JER.11.8	Yet they didn’t obey, nor turn their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of their evil heart. Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn’t do them.’”
JER.11.9	The 
JER.11.10	They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. 
JER.11.11	Therefore the 
JER.11.12	Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble. 
JER.11.13	For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.’
JER.11.14	“Therefore don’t pray for this people. Don’t lift up cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.
JER.11.15	What has my beloved to do in my house,
JER.11.15	since she has behaved lewdly with many,
JER.11.15	and the holy flesh has passed from you?
JER.11.15	When you do evil,
JER.11.15	then you rejoice.”
JER.11.16	The 
JER.11.16	beautiful with goodly fruit.”
JER.11.16	With the noise of a great roar he has kindled fire on it,
JER.11.16	and its branches are broken.
JER.11.17	For the 
JER.11.18	The 
JER.11.19	But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter. I didn’t know that they had devised plans against me, saying,
JER.11.19	“Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit,
JER.11.19	and let’s cut him off from the land of the living,
JER.11.19	that his name may be no more remembered.”
JER.11.20	But, the 
JER.11.20	who tests the heart and the mind,
JER.11.20	I will see your vengeance on them;
JER.11.20	for to you I have revealed my cause.
JER.11.21	“Therefore the 
JER.11.22	therefore the 
JER.11.23	There will be no remnant to them, for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.’”
JER.12.1	You are righteous, 
JER.12.1	when I contend with you;
JER.12.1	yet I would like to reason the cause with you.
JER.12.1	Why does the way of the wicked prosper?
JER.12.1	Why are they all at ease who deal very treacherously?
JER.12.2	You have planted them. Yes, they have taken root.
JER.12.2	They grow. Yes, they produce fruit.
JER.12.2	You are near in their mouth,
JER.12.2	and far from their heart.
JER.12.3	But you, 
JER.12.3	You see me, and test my heart towards you.
JER.12.3	Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,
JER.12.3	and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
JER.12.4	How long will the land mourn,
JER.12.4	and the herbs of the whole country wither?
JER.12.4	Because of the wickedness of those who dwell therein,
JER.12.4	the animals and birds are consumed;
JER.12.4	because they said,
JER.12.4	“He won’t see our latter end.”
JER.12.5	“If you have run with the footmen,
JER.12.5	and they have wearied you,
JER.12.5	then how can you contend with horses?
JER.12.5	Though in a land of peace you are secure,
JER.12.5	yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?
JER.12.6	For even your brothers, and the house of your father,
JER.12.6	even they have dealt treacherously with you!
JER.12.6	Even they have cried aloud after you!
JER.12.6	Don’t believe them,
JER.12.6	though they speak beautiful words to you.
JER.12.7	“I have forsaken my house.
JER.12.7	I have cast off my heritage.
JER.12.7	I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
JER.12.8	My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest.
JER.12.8	She has uttered her voice against me.
JER.12.8	Therefore I have hated her.
JER.12.9	Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey?
JER.12.9	Are the birds of prey against her all around?
JER.12.9	Go, assemble all the animals of the field.
JER.12.9	Bring them to devour.
JER.12.10	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard.
JER.12.10	They have trodden my portion under foot.
JER.12.10	They have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
JER.12.11	They have made it a desolation.
JER.12.11	It mourns to me, being desolate.
JER.12.11	The whole land is made desolate,
JER.12.11	because no one cares.
JER.12.12	Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness;
JER.12.12	for the sword of the 
JER.12.12	No flesh has peace.
JER.12.13	They have sown wheat,
JER.12.13	and have reaped thorns.
JER.12.13	They have exhausted themselves,
JER.12.13	and profit nothing.
JER.12.13	You will be ashamed of your fruits,
JER.12.13	because of the 
JER.12.14	The 
JER.12.15	It will happen that after I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them. I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. 
JER.12.16	It will happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, ‘As the 
JER.12.17	But if they will not hear, then I will pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it,” says the 
JER.13.1	The 
JER.13.2	So I bought a belt according to the 
JER.13.3	The 
JER.13.4	“Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.”
JER.13.5	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the 
JER.13.6	After many days, the 
JER.13.7	Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the belt was ruined. It was profitable for nothing.
JER.13.8	Then the 
JER.13.9	“The 
JER.13.10	This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and have gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, will even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing. 
JER.13.11	For as the belt clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to me,’ says the 
JER.13.12	“Therefore you shall speak to them this word: ‘The 
JER.13.13	Then tell them, ‘The 
JER.13.14	I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together,” says the 
JER.13.15	Hear, and give ear.
JER.13.15	Don’t be proud,
JER.13.15	for the 
JER.13.16	Give glory to the 
JER.13.16	before he causes darkness,
JER.13.16	and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains,
JER.13.16	and while you look for light,
JER.13.16	he turns it into the shadow of death,
JER.13.16	and makes it deep darkness.
JER.13.17	But if you will not hear it,
JER.13.17	my soul will weep in secret for your pride.
JER.13.17	My eye will weep bitterly,
JER.13.17	and run down with tears,
JER.13.17	because the 
JER.13.18	Say to the king and to the queen mother,
JER.13.18	“Humble yourselves.
JER.13.18	Sit down, for your crowns have come down,
JER.13.18	even the crown of your glory.
JER.13.19	The cities of the South are shut up,
JER.13.19	and there is no one to open them.
JER.13.19	Judah is carried away captive: all of them.
JER.13.19	They are wholly carried away captive.
JER.13.20	Lift up your eyes,
JER.13.20	and see those who come from the north.
JER.13.20	Where is the flock that was given to you,
JER.13.20	your beautiful flock?
JER.13.21	What will you say, when he sets over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you?
JER.13.21	Won’t sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?
JER.13.22	If you say in your heart,
JER.13.22	“Why have these things come on me?”
JER.13.22	Your skirts are uncovered because of the greatness of your iniquity,
JER.13.22	and your heels suffer violence.
JER.13.23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin,
JER.13.23	or the leopard his spots?
JER.13.23	Then may you also do good,
JER.13.23	who are accustomed to do evil.
JER.13.24	“Therefore I will scatter them,
JER.13.24	as the stubble that passes away,
JER.13.24	by the wind of the wilderness.
JER.13.25	This is your lot,
JER.13.25	the portion measured to you from me,” says the 
JER.13.25	“because you have forgotten me,
JER.13.25	and trusted in falsehood.”
JER.13.26	Therefore I will also uncover your skirts on your face,
JER.13.26	and your shame will appear.
JER.13.27	I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries,
JER.13.27	and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution,
JER.13.27	on the hills in the field.
JER.13.27	Woe to you, Jerusalem!
JER.13.27	You will not be made clean.
JER.13.27	How long will it yet be?”
JER.14.1	This is the 
JER.14.2	“Judah mourns,
JER.14.2	and its gates languish.
JER.14.2	They sit in black on the ground.
JER.14.2	The cry of Jerusalem goes up.
JER.14.3	Their nobles send their little ones to the waters.
JER.14.3	They come to the cisterns,
JER.14.3	and find no water.
JER.14.3	They return with their vessels empty.
JER.14.3	They are disappointed and confounded,
JER.14.3	and cover their heads.
JER.14.4	Because of the ground which is cracked,
JER.14.4	because no rain has been in the land,
JER.14.4	the ploughmen are disappointed.
JER.14.4	They cover their heads.
JER.14.5	Yes, the doe in the field also calves and forsakes her young,
JER.14.5	because there is no grass.
JER.14.6	The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights.
JER.14.6	They pant for air like jackals.
JER.14.6	Their eyes fail,
JER.14.6	because there is no vegetation.
JER.14.7	Though our iniquities testify against us,
JER.14.7	work for your name’s sake, 
JER.14.7	for our rebellions are many.
JER.14.7	We have sinned against you.
JER.14.8	You hope of Israel,
JER.14.8	its Saviour in the time of trouble,
JER.14.8	why should you be as a foreigner in the land,
JER.14.8	and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?
JER.14.9	Why should you be like a scared man,
JER.14.9	as a mighty man who can’t save?
JER.14.9	Yet you, 
JER.14.9	and we are called by your name.
JER.14.9	Don’t leave us.
JER.14.10	The 
JER.14.10	“Even so they have loved to wander.
JER.14.10	They have not restrained their feet.
JER.14.10	Therefore the 
JER.14.10	Now he will remember their iniquity,
JER.14.10	and punish them for their sins.”
JER.14.11	The 
JER.14.12	When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.”
JER.14.13	Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, the prophets tell them, ‘You will not see the sword, neither will you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.’”
JER.14.14	Then the 
JER.14.15	Therefore the 
JER.14.16	The people to whom they prophesy will be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. They will have no one to bury them—them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters, for I will pour their wickedness on them.
JER.14.17	“You shall say this word to them:
JER.14.17	“‘Let my eyes run down with tears night and day,
JER.14.17	and let them not cease;
JER.14.17	for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach,
JER.14.17	with a very grievous wound.
JER.14.18	If I go out into the field,
JER.14.18	then, behold, the slain with the sword!
JER.14.18	If I enter into the city,
JER.14.18	then, behold, those who are sick with famine!
JER.14.18	For both the prophet and the priest go about in the land,
JER.14.18	and have no knowledge.’”
JER.14.19	Have you utterly rejected Judah?
JER.14.19	Has your soul loathed Zion?
JER.14.19	Why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us?
JER.14.19	We looked for peace, but no good came;
JER.14.19	and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!
JER.14.20	We acknowledge, 
JER.14.20	and the iniquity of our fathers;
JER.14.20	for we have sinned against you.
JER.14.21	Do not abhor us, for your name’s sake.
JER.14.21	Do not disgrace the throne of your glory.
JER.14.21	Remember, and don’t break your covenant with us.
JER.14.22	Are there any amongst the vanities of the nations that can cause rain?
JER.14.22	Or can the sky give showers?
JER.14.22	Aren’t you he, the 
JER.14.22	Therefore we will wait for you;
JER.14.22	for you have made all these things.
JER.15.1	Then the 
JER.15.2	It will happen, when they ask you, ‘Where shall we go out?’ then you shall tell them, ‘The 
JER.15.2	“Such as are for death, to death;
JER.15.2	such as are for the sword, to the sword;
JER.15.2	such as are for the famine, to the famine;
JER.15.2	and such as are for captivity, to captivity.”’
JER.15.3	“I will appoint over them four kinds,” says the 
JER.15.4	I will cause them to be tossed back and forth amongst all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
JER.15.5	For who will have pity on you, Jerusalem?
JER.15.5	Who will mourn you?
JER.15.5	Who will come to ask of your welfare?
JER.15.6	You have rejected me,” says the 
JER.15.6	“You have gone backward.
JER.15.6	Therefore I have stretched out my hand against you
JER.15.6	and destroyed you.
JER.15.6	I am weary of showing compassion.
JER.15.7	I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land.
JER.15.7	I have bereaved them of children.
JER.15.7	I have destroyed my people.
JER.15.7	They didn’t return from their ways.
JER.15.8	Their widows are increased more than the sand of the seas.
JER.15.8	I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday.
JER.15.8	I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly.
JER.15.9	She who has borne seven languishes.
JER.15.9	She has given up the spirit.
JER.15.9	Her sun has gone down while it was yet day.
JER.15.9	She has been disappointed and confounded.
JER.15.9	I will deliver their residue to the sword before their enemies,” says the 
JER.15.10	Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me, a man of strife,
JER.15.10	and a man of contention to the whole earth!
JER.15.10	I have not lent, neither have men lent to me;
JER.15.10	yet every one of them curses me.
JER.15.11	The 
JER.15.11	“Most certainly I will strengthen you for good.
JER.15.11	Most certainly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you in the time of evil
JER.15.11	and in the time of affliction.
JER.15.12	Can one break iron,
JER.15.12	even iron from the north, and bronze?
JER.15.13	I will give your substance and your treasures for a plunder without price,
JER.15.13	and that for all your sins,
JER.15.13	even in all your borders.
JER.15.14	I will make them to pass with your enemies into a land which you don’t know;
JER.15.14	for a fire is kindled in my anger,
JER.15.14	which will burn on you.”
JER.15.15	, you know.
JER.15.15	Remember me, visit me,
JER.15.15	and avenge me of my persecutors.
JER.15.15	You are patient, so don’t take me away.
JER.15.15	Know that for your sake I have suffered reproach.
JER.15.16	Your words were found,
JER.15.16	and I ate them.
JER.15.16	Your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart,
JER.15.16	for I am called by your name, the 
JER.15.17	I didn’t sit in the assembly of those who make merry and rejoice.
JER.15.17	I sat alone because of your hand,
JER.15.17	for you have filled me with indignation.
JER.15.18	Why is my pain perpetual,
JER.15.18	and my wound incurable,
JER.15.18	which refuses to be healed?
JER.15.18	Will you indeed be to me as a deceitful brook,
JER.15.18	like waters that fail?
JER.15.19	Therefore the 
JER.15.19	“If you return, then I will bring you again,
JER.15.19	that you may stand before me;
JER.15.19	and if you take out the precious from the vile,
JER.15.19	you will be as my mouth.
JER.15.19	They will return to you,
JER.15.19	but you will not return to them.
JER.15.20	I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall.
JER.15.20	They will fight against you,
JER.15.20	but they will not prevail against you;
JER.15.20	for I am with you to save you
JER.15.20	and to deliver you,” says the 
JER.15.21	“I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked,
JER.15.21	and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.”
JER.16.1	Then The 
JER.16.2	“You shall not take a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters, in this place.” 
JER.16.3	For the 
JER.16.4	“They will die grievous deaths. They will not be lamented, neither will they be buried. They will be as dung on the surface of the ground. They will be consumed by the sword and by famine. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.”
JER.16.5	For the 
JER.16.6	Both great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried. Men won’t lament for them, cut themselves, or make themselves bald for them. 
JER.16.7	Men won’t break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead. Men won’t give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
JER.16.8	“You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.” 
JER.16.9	For the 
JER.16.10	It will happen, when you tell this people all these words, and they ask you, ‘Why has the 
JER.16.11	then you shall tell them, ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me,’ says the 
JER.16.12	You have done evil more than your fathers, for behold, you each walk after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you don’t listen to me. 
JER.16.13	Therefore I will cast you out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers. There you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favour.’
JER.16.14	“Therefore behold, the days come,” says the 
JER.16.15	but, ‘As the 
JER.16.16	“Behold, I will send for many fishermen,” says the 
JER.16.17	For my eyes are on all their ways. They are not hidden from my face. Their iniquity isn’t concealed from my eyes. 
JER.16.18	First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.”
JER.16.19	, my strength, and my stronghold,
JER.16.19	and my refuge in the day of affliction,
JER.16.19	the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth,
JER.16.19	and will say,
JER.16.19	“Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies,
JER.16.19	vanity and things in which there is no profit.
JER.16.20	Should a man make to himself gods
JER.16.20	which yet are no gods?”
JER.16.21	“Therefore behold, I will cause them to know,
JER.16.21	this once I will cause them to know my hand and my might.
JER.16.21	Then they will know that my name is the 
JER.17.1	“The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron,
JER.17.1	and with the point of a diamond.
JER.17.1	It is engraved on the tablet of their heart,
JER.17.1	and on the horns of your altars.
JER.17.2	Even their children remember their altars
JER.17.2	and their Asherah poles by the green trees on the high hills.
JER.17.3	My mountain in the field,
JER.17.3	I will give your substance and all your treasures for a plunder,
JER.17.3	and your high places, because of sin, throughout all your borders.
JER.17.4	You, even of yourself, will discontinue from your heritage that I gave you.
JER.17.4	I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you don’t know,
JER.17.4	for you have kindled a fire in my anger which will burn forever.”
JER.17.5	The 
JER.17.5	“Cursed is the man who trusts in man,
JER.17.5	relies on strength of flesh,
JER.17.5	and whose heart departs from the 
JER.17.6	For he will be like a bush in the desert,
JER.17.6	and will not see when good comes,
JER.17.6	but will inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,
JER.17.6	an uninhabited salt land.
JER.17.7	“Blessed is the man who trusts in the 
JER.17.7	and whose confidence is in the 
JER.17.8	For he will be as a tree planted by the waters,
JER.17.8	who spreads out its roots by the river,
JER.17.8	and will not fear when heat comes,
JER.17.8	but its leaf will be green,
JER.17.8	and will not be concerned in the year of drought.
JER.17.8	It won’t cease from yielding fruit.
JER.17.9	The heart is deceitful above all things
JER.17.9	and it is exceedingly corrupt.
JER.17.9	Who can know it?
JER.17.10	“I, the 
JER.17.10	I try the heart,
JER.17.10	even to give every man according to his ways,
JER.17.10	according to the fruit of his doings.”
JER.17.11	As the partridge that sits on eggs which she has not laid,
JER.17.11	so is he who gets riches, and not by right.
JER.17.11	In the middle of his days, they will leave him.
JER.17.11	At his end, he will be a fool.
JER.17.12	A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning,
JER.17.12	is the place of our sanctuary.
JER.17.13	, the hope of Israel,
JER.17.13	all who forsake you will be disappointed.
JER.17.13	Those who depart from me will be written in the earth,
JER.17.13	because they have forsaken the 
JER.17.13	the spring of living waters.
JER.17.14	Heal me, O 
JER.17.14	Save me, and I will be saved;
JER.17.14	for you are my praise.
JER.17.15	Behold, they ask me,
JER.17.15	“Where is the 
JER.17.15	Let it be fulfilled now.”
JER.17.16	As for me, I have not hurried from being a shepherd after you.
JER.17.16	I haven’t desired the woeful day. You know.
JER.17.16	That which came out of my lips was before your face.
JER.17.17	Don’t be a terror to me.
JER.17.17	You are my refuge in the day of evil.
JER.17.18	Let them be disappointed who persecute me,
JER.17.18	but let not me be disappointed.
JER.17.18	Let them be dismayed,
JER.17.18	but don’t let me be dismayed.
JER.17.18	Bring on them the day of evil,
JER.17.18	and destroy them with double destruction.
JER.17.19	The 
JER.17.20	Tell them, ‘Hear the 
JER.17.21	The 
JER.17.22	Don’t carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day. Don’t do any work, but make the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers. 
JER.17.23	But they didn’t listen. They didn’t turn their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction. 
JER.17.24	It will happen, if you diligently listen to me,” says the 
JER.17.25	then there will enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on David’s throne, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city will remain forever. 
JER.17.26	They will come from the cities of Judah, and from the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country, and from the South, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, meal offerings, and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving, to the 
JER.17.27	But if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem. It will not be quenched.”’”
JER.18.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.18.2	“Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear my words.”
JER.18.3	Then I went down to the potter’s house, and behold, he was making something on the wheels. 
JER.18.4	When the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
JER.18.5	Then the 
JER.18.6	“House of Israel, can’t I do with you as this potter?” says the 
JER.18.7	At the instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it; 
JER.18.8	if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them. 
JER.18.9	At the instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; 
JER.18.10	if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they not obey my voice, then I will repent of the good with which I said I would benefit them.
JER.18.11	“Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, ‘The 
JER.18.12	But they say, ‘It is in vain; for we will walk after our own plans, and we will each follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.’”
JER.18.13	Therefore the 
JER.18.13	“Ask now amongst the nations,
JER.18.13	‘Who has heard such things?’
JER.18.13	The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.
JER.18.14	Will the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field?
JER.18.14	Will the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?
JER.18.15	For my people have forgotten me.
JER.18.15	They have burnt incense to false gods.
JER.18.15	They have been made to stumble in their ways,
JER.18.15	in the ancient paths,
JER.18.15	to walk in byways, in a way not built up,
JER.18.16	to make their land an astonishment,
JER.18.16	and a perpetual hissing.
JER.18.16	Everyone who passes by it will be astonished,
JER.18.16	and shake his head.
JER.18.17	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy.
JER.18.17	I will show them the back, and not the face,
JER.18.17	in the day of their calamity.
JER.18.18	Then they said, “Come! Let’s devise plans against Jeremiah; for the law won’t perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let’s strike him with the tongue, and let’s not give heed to any of his words.”
JER.18.19	Give heed to me, 
JER.18.19	and listen to the voice of those who contend with me.
JER.18.20	Should evil be recompensed for good?
JER.18.20	For they have dug a pit for my soul.
JER.18.20	Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them,
JER.18.20	to turn away your wrath from them.
JER.18.21	Therefore deliver up their children to the famine,
JER.18.21	and give them over to the power of the sword.
JER.18.21	Let their wives become childless and widows.
JER.18.21	Let their men be killed
JER.18.21	and their young men struck by the sword in battle.
JER.18.22	Let a cry be heard from their houses
JER.18.22	when you bring a troop suddenly on them;
JER.18.22	for they have dug a pit to take me
JER.18.22	and hidden snares for my feet.
JER.18.23	Yet, 
JER.18.23	Don’t forgive their iniquity.
JER.18.23	Don’t blot out their sin from your sight,
JER.18.23	Let them be overthrown before you.
JER.18.23	Deal with them in the time of your anger.
JER.19.1	Thus said the 
JER.19.2	and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I will tell you. 
JER.19.3	Say, ‘Hear the 
JER.19.4	Because they have forsaken me, and have defiled this place, and have burnt incense in it to other gods that they didn’t know, they, their fathers, and the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents, 
JER.19.5	and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their children in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I didn’t command, nor speak, which didn’t even enter into my mind. 
JER.19.6	Therefore, behold, the days come,” says the 
JER.19.7	“‘“I will make the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem void in this place. I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth. 
JER.19.8	I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues. 
JER.19.9	I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters. They will each eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies, and those who seek their life, will distress them.”’
JER.19.10	“Then you shall break the container in the sight of the men who go with you, 
JER.19.11	and shall tell them, ‘The 
JER.19.12	This is what I will do to this place,” says the 
JER.19.13	The houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, will be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have burnt incense to all the army of the sky and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.”’”
JER.19.14	Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the 
JER.19.15	“The 
JER.20.1	Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the 
JER.20.2	Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the 
JER.20.3	On the next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “The 
JER.20.4	For the 
JER.20.5	Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all its precious things, yes, I will give all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies. They will make them captives, take them, and carry them to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house will go into captivity. You will come to Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.’”
JER.20.7	, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded.
JER.20.7	You are stronger than I, and have prevailed.
JER.20.7	I have become a laughingstock all day.
JER.20.7	Everyone mocks me.
JER.20.8	For as often as I speak, I cry out;
JER.20.8	I cry, “Violence and destruction!”
JER.20.8	because the 
JER.20.8	and a derision, all day.
JER.20.9	If I say, I will not make mention of him,
JER.20.9	or speak any more in his name,
JER.20.9	then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones.
JER.20.9	I am weary with holding it in.
JER.20.9	I can’t.
JER.20.10	For I have heard the defaming of many,
JER.20.10	“Terror on every side!
JER.20.10	Denounce, and we will denounce him!”
JER.20.10	say all my familiar friends,
JER.20.10	those who watch for my fall.
JER.20.10	“Perhaps he will be persuaded,
JER.20.10	and we will prevail against him,
JER.20.10	and we will take our revenge on him.”
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.11	Therefore my persecutors will stumble,
JER.20.11	and they won’t prevail.
JER.20.11	They will be utterly disappointed,
JER.20.11	because they have not dealt wisely,
JER.20.11	even with an everlasting dishonour which will never be forgotten.
JER.20.12	But the 
JER.20.12	who sees the heart and the mind,
JER.20.12	let me see your vengeance on them,
JER.20.12	for I have revealed my cause to you.
JER.20.13	Sing to the 
JER.20.13	Praise the 
JER.20.13	for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.
JER.20.14	Cursed is the day in which I was born.
JER.20.14	Don’t let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.
JER.20.15	Cursed is the man who brought news to my father, saying,
JER.20.15	“A boy is born to you,” making him very glad.
JER.20.16	Let that man be as the cities which the 
JER.20.16	and didn’t repent.
JER.20.16	Let him hear a cry in the morning,
JER.20.16	and shouting at noontime;
JER.20.17	because he didn’t kill me from the womb.
JER.20.17	So my mother would have been my grave,
JER.20.17	and her womb always great.
JER.20.18	Why did I come out of the womb to see labour and sorrow,
JER.20.18	that my days should be consumed with shame?
JER.21.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.21.2	“Please enquire of the 
JER.21.3	Then Jeremiah said to them, “Tell Zedekiah: 
JER.21.4	‘The 
JER.21.5	I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation. 
JER.21.6	I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and animal. They will die of a great pestilence. 
JER.21.7	Afterward,” says the 
JER.21.8	“You shall say to this people, ‘The 
JER.21.9	He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he will live, and he will escape with his life. 
JER.21.10	For I have set my face on this city for evil, and not for good,” says the 
JER.21.11	“Concerning the house of the king of Judah, hear the 
JER.21.12	House of David, the 
JER.21.12	‘Execute justice in the morning,
JER.21.12	and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor,
JER.21.12	lest my wrath go out like fire,
JER.21.12	and burn so that no one can quench it,
JER.21.12	because of the evil of your doings.
JER.21.13	Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,
JER.21.13	and of the rock of the plain,’ says the 
JER.21.13	‘You that say, “Who would come down against us?”
JER.21.13	or “Who would enter into our homes?”
JER.21.14	I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says the 
JER.21.14	and I will kindle a fire in her forest,
JER.21.14	and it will devour all that is around her.’”
JER.22.1	The 
JER.22.2	‘Hear the 
JER.22.3	The 
JER.22.4	For if you do this thing indeed, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter in by the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his servants, and his people. 
JER.22.5	But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself,” says the 
JER.22.6	For the 
JER.22.6	“You are Gilead to me,
JER.22.6	the head of Lebanon.
JER.22.6	Yet surely I will make you a wilderness,
JER.22.6	cities which are not inhabited.
JER.22.7	I will prepare destroyers against you,
JER.22.7	everyone with his weapons,
JER.22.7	and they will cut down your choice cedars,
JER.22.7	and cast them into the fire.
JER.22.8	“Many nations will pass by this city, and they will each ask his neighbour, ‘Why has the 
JER.22.9	Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of the 
JER.22.10	Don’t weep for the dead.
JER.22.10	Don’t bemoan him;
JER.22.10	but weep bitterly for him who goes away,
JER.22.10	for he will return no more,
JER.22.10	and not see his native country.
JER.22.11	For the 
JER.22.12	But he will die in the place where they have led him captive. He will see this land no more.”
JER.22.13	“Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,
JER.22.13	and his rooms by injustice;
JER.22.13	who uses his neighbour’s service without wages,
JER.22.13	and doesn’t give him his hire;
JER.22.14	who says, ‘I will build myself a wide house and spacious rooms,’
JER.22.14	and cuts out windows for himself;
JER.22.14	with a cedar ceiling,
JER.22.14	and painted with red.
JER.22.15	“Should you reign, because you strive to excel in cedar?
JER.22.15	Didn’t your father eat and drink,
JER.22.15	and do justice and righteousness?
JER.22.15	Then it was well with him.
JER.22.16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy;
JER.22.16	so it was well, then.
JER.22.16	Wasn’t this to know me?”
JER.22.16	says the 
JER.22.17	But your eyes and your heart are only for your covetousness,
JER.22.17	for shedding innocent blood,
JER.22.17	for oppression, and for doing violence.”
JER.22.18	Therefore the 
JER.22.18	“They won’t lament for him,
JER.22.18	saying, ‘Ah my brother!’ or, ‘Ah sister!’
JER.22.18	They won’t lament for him,
JER.22.18	saying ‘Ah lord!’ or, ‘Ah his glory!’
JER.22.19	He will be buried with the burial of a donkey,
JER.22.19	drawn and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”
JER.22.20	“Go up to Lebanon, and cry.
JER.22.20	Lift up your voice in Bashan,
JER.22.20	and cry from Abarim;
JER.22.20	for all your lovers have been destroyed.
JER.22.21	I spoke to you in your prosperity;
JER.22.21	but you said, ‘I will not listen.’
JER.22.21	This has been your way from your youth,
JER.22.21	that you didn’t obey my voice.
JER.22.22	The wind will feed all your shepherds,
JER.22.22	and your lovers will go into captivity.
JER.22.22	Surely then you will be ashamed
JER.22.22	and confounded for all your wickedness.
JER.22.23	Inhabitant of Lebanon,
JER.22.23	who makes your nest in the cedars,
JER.22.23	how greatly to be pitied you will be when pangs come on you,
JER.22.23	the pain as of a woman in travail!
JER.22.24	“As I live,” says the 
JER.22.25	I would give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
JER.22.26	I will cast you out with your mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born; and there you will die. 
JER.22.27	But to the land to which their soul longs to return, there they will not return.”
JER.22.28	Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel?
JER.22.28	Is he a vessel in which no one delights?
JER.22.28	Why are they cast out, he and his offspring,
JER.22.28	and cast into a land which they don’t know?
JER.22.29	O earth, earth, earth,
JER.22.29	hear the 
JER.22.30	The 
JER.22.30	“Record this man as childless,
JER.22.30	a man who will not prosper in his days;
JER.22.30	for no more will a man of his offspring prosper,
JER.22.30	sitting on David’s throne,
JER.22.30	and ruling in Judah.”
JER.23.1	“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” says the 
JER.23.2	Therefore the 
JER.23.3	“I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they will be fruitful and multiply. 
JER.23.4	I will set up shepherds over them, who will feed them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, neither will any be lacking,” says the 
JER.23.5	“Behold, the days come,” says the 
JER.23.5	“that I will raise to David a righteous Branch,
JER.23.5	and he will reign as king and deal wisely,
JER.23.5	and will execute justice and righteousness in the land.
JER.23.6	In his days Judah will be saved,
JER.23.6	and Israel will dwell safely.
JER.23.6	This is his name by which he will be called:
JER.23.6	The 
JER.23.7	“Therefore behold, the days come,” says the 
JER.23.8	but, ‘As the 
JER.23.9	Concerning the prophets:
JER.23.9	My heart within me is broken.
JER.23.9	All my bones shake.
JER.23.9	I am like a drunken man,
JER.23.9	and like a man whom wine has overcome,
JER.23.9	because of the 
JER.23.9	and because of his holy words.
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers;
JER.23.10	for because of the curse the land mourns.
JER.23.10	The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.
JER.23.10	Their course is evil,
JER.23.10	and their might is not right;
JER.23.11	for both prophet and priest are profane.
JER.23.11	Yes, in my house I have found their wickedness,” says the 
JER.23.12	Therefore their way will be to them as slippery places in the darkness.
JER.23.12	They will be driven on,
JER.23.12	and fall therein;
JER.23.12	for I will bring evil on them,
JER.23.12	even the year of their visitation,” says the 
JER.23.13	“I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria.
JER.23.13	They prophesied by Baal,
JER.23.13	and caused my people Israel to err.
JER.23.14	In the prophets of Jerusalem I have also seen a horrible thing:
JER.23.14	they commit adultery and walk in lies.
JER.23.14	They strengthen the hands of evildoers,
JER.23.14	so that no one returns from his wickedness.
JER.23.14	They have all become to me as Sodom,
JER.23.14	and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.”
JER.23.15	Therefore the 
JER.23.15	“Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,
JER.23.15	and make them drink poisoned water;
JER.23.15	for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land.”
JER.23.16	The 
JER.23.16	“Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.
JER.23.16	They teach you vanity.
JER.23.16	They speak a vision of their own heart,
JER.23.16	and not out of the mouth of the 
JER.23.17	They say continually to those who despise me,
JER.23.17	‘The 
JER.23.17	and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say,
JER.23.17	‘No evil will come on you.’
JER.23.18	For who has stood in the council of the 
JER.23.18	that he should perceive and hear his word?
JER.23.18	Who has listened to my word, and heard it?
JER.23.19	Behold, the 
JER.23.19	Yes, a whirling storm:
JER.23.19	It will burst on the head of the wicked.
JER.23.20	The 
JER.23.20	and until he has performed the intents of his heart.
JER.23.20	In the latter days, you will understand it perfectly.
JER.23.21	I didn’t send these prophets, yet they ran.
JER.23.21	I didn’t speak to them, yet they prophesied.
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in my council,
JER.23.22	then they would have caused my people to hear my words,
JER.23.22	and would have turned them from their evil way,
JER.23.22	and from the evil of their doings.
JER.23.23	“Am I a God at hand,” says the 
JER.23.23	“and not a God afar off?
JER.23.24	Can anyone hide himself in secret places
JER.23.24	so that I can’t see him?” says the 
JER.23.24	“Don’t I fill heaven and earth?” says the 
JER.23.25	“I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’ 
JER.23.26	How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart? 
JER.23.27	They intend to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they each tell his neighbour, as their fathers forgot my name because of Baal. 
JER.23.28	The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat?” says the 
JER.23.29	“Isn’t my word like fire?” says the 
JER.23.30	“Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” says the 
JER.23.31	Behold, I am against the prophets,” says the 
JER.23.32	Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,” says the 
JER.23.33	“When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What is the message from the 
JER.23.34	As for the prophet, the priest, and the people, who say, ‘The message from the 
JER.23.35	You will say everyone to his neighbour, and everyone to his brother, ‘What has the 
JER.23.36	You will mention the message from the 
JER.23.37	You will say to the prophet, ‘What has the 
JER.23.38	Although you say, ‘The message from the 
JER.23.39	therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence. 
JER.23.40	I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which will not be forgotten.’”
JER.24.1	The 
JER.24.2	One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
JER.24.3	Then the 
JER.24.3	I said, “Figs. The good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so bad that can’t be eaten.”
JER.24.4	The 
JER.24.5	“The 
JER.24.6	For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land. I will build them, and not pull them down. I will plant them, and not pluck them up. 
JER.24.7	I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the 
JER.24.8	“‘As the bad figs, which can’t be eaten, they are so bad,’ surely the 
JER.24.9	I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth amongst all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I will drive them. 
JER.24.10	I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, amongst them, until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.’”
JER.25.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (this was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), 
JER.25.2	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: 
JER.25.3	From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, the 
JER.25.4	The 
JER.25.5	saying, “Return now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the 
JER.25.6	Don’t go after other gods to serve them or worship them, and don’t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands; then I will do you no harm.”
JER.25.7	“Yet you have not listened to me,” says the 
JER.25.8	Therefore the 
JER.25.9	behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,” says the 
JER.25.10	Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. 
JER.25.11	This whole land will be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
JER.25.12	“It will happen, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,” says the 
JER.25.13	I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. 
JER.25.14	For many nations and great kings will make bondservants of them, even of them. I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.”
JER.25.15	For the 
JER.25.16	They will drink, and reel back and forth, and be insane, because of the sword that I will send amongst them.”
JER.25.17	Then I took the cup at the 
JER.25.18	Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, with its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is today; 
JER.25.19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, with his servants, his princes, and all his people; 
JER.25.20	and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; 
JER.25.21	Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon; 
JER.25.22	and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea; 
JER.25.23	Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who have the corners of their beard cut off; 
JER.25.24	and all the kings of Arabia, all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness; 
JER.25.25	and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes; 
JER.25.26	and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the surface of the earth. The king of Sheshach will drink after them.
JER.25.27	“You shall tell them, ‘The 
JER.25.28	It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then you shall tell them, ‘The 
JER.25.29	For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished? You will not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says the 
JER.25.30	“Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and tell them,
JER.25.30	“‘The 
JER.25.30	and utter his voice from his holy habitation.
JER.25.30	He will mightily roar against his fold.
JER.25.30	He will give a shout, as those who tread grapes,
JER.25.30	against all the inhabitants of the earth.
JER.25.31	A noise will come even to the end of the earth;
JER.25.31	for the 
JER.25.31	He will enter into judgement with all flesh.
JER.25.31	As for the wicked, he will give them to the sword,”’ says the 
JER.25.32	The 
JER.25.32	“Behold, evil will go out from nation to nation,
JER.25.32	and a great storm will be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.”
JER.25.33	The slain of the 
JER.25.34	Wail, you shepherds, and cry.
JER.25.34	Wallow in dust, you leader of the flock;
JER.25.34	for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions have fully come,
JER.25.34	and you will fall like fine pottery.
JER.25.35	The shepherds will have no way to flee.
JER.25.35	The leader of the flock will have no escape.
JER.25.36	A voice of the cry of the shepherds,
JER.25.36	and the wailing of the leader of the flock,
JER.25.36	for the 
JER.25.37	The peaceful folds are brought to silence
JER.25.37	because of the fierce anger of the 
JER.25.38	He has left his covert, as the lion;
JER.25.38	for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression,
JER.25.38	and because of his fierce anger.
JER.26.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the 
JER.26.2	“The 
JER.26.3	It may be they will listen, and every man turn from his evil way; that I may relent from the evil which I intend to do to them because of the evil of their doings.’ 
JER.26.4	You shall tell them, “The 
JER.26.5	to listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them, but you have not listened; 
JER.26.6	then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.”’”
JER.26.7	The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the 
JER.26.8	When Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the 
JER.26.9	Why have you prophesied in the 
JER.26.10	When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the 
JER.26.11	Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, “This man is worthy of death; for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.”
JER.26.12	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, “The 
JER.26.13	Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the 
JER.26.14	But as for me, behold, I am in your hand. Do with me what is good and right in your eyes. 
JER.26.15	Only know for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for in truth the 
JER.26.16	Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets: “This man is not worthy of death; for he has spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.26.17	Then certain of the elders of the land rose up, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying, 
JER.26.18	“Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘The 
JER.26.18	“‘Zion will be ploughed as a field,
JER.26.18	and Jerusalem will become heaps,
JER.26.18	and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.’
JER.26.19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Didn’t he fear the 
JER.26.20	There was also a man who prophesied in the 
JER.26.21	When Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt. 
JER.26.22	Then Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt; 
JER.26.23	and they fetched Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
JER.26.24	But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they didn’t give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.27.2	the 
JER.27.3	Then send them to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the children of Ammon, to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. 
JER.27.4	Give them a command to their masters, saying, ‘The 
JER.27.5	‘I have made the earth, the men, and the animals that are on the surface of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm. I give it to whom it seems right to me. 
JER.27.6	Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant. I have also given the animals of the field to him to serve him. 
JER.27.7	All the nations will serve him, his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings will make him their bondservant.
JER.27.8	“‘“‘It will happen that I will punish the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,’ says the 
JER.27.9	But as for you, don’t listen to your prophets, to your diviners, to your dreams, to your soothsayers, or to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “You shall not serve the king of Babylon;” 
JER.27.10	for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, so that I would drive you out, and you would perish. 
JER.27.11	But the nation that brings their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, that nation I will let remain in their own land,’ says the 
JER.27.12	I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. 
JER.27.13	Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the 
JER.27.14	Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you. 
JER.27.15	For I have not sent them,” says the 
JER.27.16	Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, the 
JER.27.17	Don’t listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city become a desolation? 
JER.27.18	But if they are prophets, and if the 
JER.27.19	For the 
JER.27.20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn’t take when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 
JER.27.21	yes, the 
JER.27.22	‘They will be carried to Babylon, and there they will be, until the day that I visit them,’ says the 
JER.28.1	That same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the 
JER.28.2	“The 
JER.28.3	Within two full years I will bring again into this place all the vessels of the 
JER.28.4	I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon,’ says the 
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the 
JER.28.6	even the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the 
JER.28.7	Nevertheless listen now to this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people: 
JER.28.8	The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, of evil, and of pestilence. 
JER.28.9	The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet happens, then the prophet will be known, that the 
JER.28.10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it. 
JER.28.11	Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “The 
JER.28.12	Then the 
JER.28.13	“Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘The

JER.28.16	Therefore the 
JER.28.17	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
JER.29.1	Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon, 
JER.29.2	(after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem), 
JER.29.3	by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon). It said:
JER.29.4	The 
JER.29.5	“Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit. 
JER.29.6	Take wives and father sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there, and don’t be diminished. 
JER.29.7	Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to the 
JER.29.8	For the 
JER.29.9	For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them,” says the 
JER.29.10	For the 
JER.29.11	For I know the thoughts that I think towards you,” says the 
JER.29.12	You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 
JER.29.13	You shall seek me, and find me, when you search for me with all your heart. 
JER.29.14	I will be found by you,” says the 
JER.29.15	Because you have said, “The 
JER.29.16	the 
JER.29.17	the 
JER.29.18	I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth amongst all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach amongst all the nations where I have driven them, 
JER.29.19	because they have not listened to my words,” says the 
JER.29.20	Hear therefore the 
JER.29.21	The 
JER.29.22	A curse will be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, ‘The 
JER.29.23	because they have done foolish things in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I didn’t command them. I am he who knows, and am witness,” says the 
JER.29.24	Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying, 
JER.29.25	“The 
JER.29.26	“The 
JER.29.27	Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you, 
JER.29.28	because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long. Build houses, and dwell in them. Plant gardens, and eat their fruit?”’”
JER.29.29	Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet. 
JER.29.30	Then the 
JER.29.31	“Send to all of the captives, saying, ‘The 
JER.29.32	therefore the 
JER.30.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.30.2	“The 
JER.30.3	For, behold, the days come,’ says the 
JER.30.4	These are the words that the 
JER.30.5	For the 
JER.30.5	“We have heard a voice of trembling;
JER.30.5	a voice of fear, and not of peace.

JER.30.6	Why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail,
JER.30.6	and all faces are turned pale?
JER.30.7	Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it.
JER.30.7	It is even the time of Jacob’s trouble;
JER.30.7	but he will be saved out of it.
JER.30.8	It will come to pass in that day, says the 
JER.30.8	and will burst your bonds.
JER.30.8	Strangers will no more make them their bondservants;
JER.30.9	but they will serve the 
JER.30.9	and David their king,

JER.30.10	Therefore don’t be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says the 
JER.30.10	Don’t be dismayed, Israel.
JER.30.10	For, behold, I will save you from afar,
JER.30.10	and save your offspring from the land of their captivity.
JER.30.10	Jacob will return,
JER.30.10	and will be quiet and at ease.
JER.30.10	No one will make him afraid.

JER.30.11	for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you,
JER.30.11	but I will not make a full end of you;
JER.30.11	but I will correct you in measure,
JER.30.11	and will in no way leave you unpunished.”
JER.30.12	For the 
JER.30.12	“Your hurt is incurable.
JER.30.12	Your wound is grievous.
JER.30.13	There is no one to plead your cause,

JER.30.14	with the chastisement of a cruel one,
JER.30.14	for the greatness of your iniquity,
JER.30.14	because your sins were increased.
JER.30.15	Why do you cry over your injury?
JER.30.15	Your pain is incurable.
JER.30.15	For the greatness of your iniquity,
JER.30.15	because your sins have increased,

JER.30.16	Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured.
JER.30.16	All your adversaries, everyone of them, will go into captivity.
JER.30.16	Those who plunder you will be plunder.

JER.31.11	and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.
JER.31.12	They will come and sing in the height of Zion,
JER.31.12	and will flow to the goodness of the 
JER.31.12	to the grain, to the new wine, to the oil,
JER.31.12	and to the young of the flock and of the herd.
JER.31.12	Their soul will be as a watered garden.
JER.31.12	They will not sorrow any more at all.
JER.31.13	Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance;
JER.31.13	the young men and the old together;
JER.31.13	for I will turn their mourning into joy,
JER.31.13	and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
JER.31.14	I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness,
JER.31.14	and my people will be satisfied with my goodness,” says the 
JER.31.15	The 
JER.31.15	“A voice is heard in Ramah,
JER.31.15	lamentation and bitter weeping,
JER.31.15	Rachel weeping for her children.
JER.31.15	She refuses to be comforted for her children,
JER.31.15	because they are no more.”
JER.31.16	The 
JER.31.16	“Refrain your voice from weeping,
JER.31.16	and your eyes from tears;
JER.31.16	for your work will be rewarded,” says the 
JER.31.16	“They will come again from the land of the enemy.
JER.31.17	There is hope for your latter end,” says the 
JER.31.17	“Your children will come again to their own territory.
JER.31.18	“I have surely heard Ephraim grieving thus,
JER.31.18	‘You have chastised me,
JER.31.18	and I was chastised, as an untrained calf.
JER.31.18	Turn me, and I will be turned;
JER.31.18	for you are the 
JER.31.19	Surely after that I was turned.
JER.31.19	I repented.
JER.31.19	After that I was instructed.
JER.31.19	I struck my thigh.
JER.31.19	I was ashamed, yes, even confounded,
JER.31.19	because I bore the reproach of my youth.’
JER.31.20	Is Ephraim my dear son?
JER.31.20	Is he a darling child?
JER.31.20	For as often as I speak against him,
JER.31.20	I still earnestly remember him.
JER.31.20	therefore my heart yearns for him.
JER.31.20	I will surely have mercy on him,” says the 
JER.31.21	“Set up road signs.
JER.31.21	Make guideposts.
JER.31.21	Set your heart towards the highway,
JER.31.21	even the way by which you went.
JER.31.21	Turn again, virgin of Israel.
JER.31.21	Turn again to these your cities.
JER.31.22	How long will you go here and there,
JER.31.22	you backsliding daughter?
JER.31.22	For the 
JER.31.22	a woman will encompass a man.”
JER.31.23	The 
JER.31.24	Judah and all its cities will dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks. 
JER.31.25	For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.”
JER.31.26	On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.
JER.31.27	“Behold, the days come,” says the 
JER.31.28	It will happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” says the 
JER.31.29	“In those days they will say no more,
JER.31.29	“‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
JER.31.29	and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’
JER.31.30	But everyone will die for his own iniquity. Every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge.
JER.31.31	“Behold, the days come,” says the 
JER.31.31	“that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel,
JER.31.31	and with the house of Judah:
JER.31.32	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
JER.31.32	which covenant of mine they broke,
JER.31.32	although I was a husband to them,” says the 
JER.31.33	“But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,”
JER.31.33	says the 
JER.31.33	“I will put my law in their inward parts,
JER.31.33	and I will write it in their heart.
JER.31.33	I will be their God,
JER.31.33	and they shall be my people.
JER.31.34	They will no longer each teach his neighbour,
JER.31.34	and every man teach his brother, saying, ‘Know the 
JER.31.34	for they will all know me,
JER.31.34	from their least to their greatest,” says the 
JER.31.34	“for I will forgive their iniquity,
JER.31.34	and I will remember their sin no more.”
JER.31.35	The 
JER.31.35	and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,
JER.31.35	who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar;
JER.31.35	the 
JER.31.36	“If these ordinances depart from before me,” says the 
JER.31.36	“then the offspring of Israel also will cease from being a nation before me forever.”
JER.31.37	The 
JER.31.37	and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,
JER.31.37	then I will also cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done,” says the 
JER.31.38	“Behold, the days come,” says the 
JER.31.39	The measuring line will go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and will turn towards Goah. 
JER.31.40	The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate towards the east, will be holy to the 
JER.32.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.32.2	Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem. Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.
JER.32.3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy, and say, ‘The 
JER.32.4	and Zedekiah king of Judah won’t escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes will see his eyes; 
JER.32.5	and he will bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit him,” says the 
JER.32.6	Jeremiah said, “The 
JER.32.7	‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, “Buy my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.”’”
JER.32.8	“So Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the 
JER.32.8	“Then I knew that this was the 
JER.32.9	I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels
JER.32.10	I signed the deed, sealed it, called witnesses, and weighed the money in the balances to him. 
JER.32.11	So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open; 
JER.32.12	and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.
JER.32.13	“I commanded Baruch before them, saying, 
JER.32.14	the 
JER.32.15	For the 
JER.32.16	Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the 
JER.32.17	“Ah Lord GOD! Behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for you. 
JER.32.18	You show loving kindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them. The great, the mighty God, the 
JER.32.19	great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings; 
JER.32.20	who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and amongst other men; and made yourself a name, as it is today; 
JER.32.21	and brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, with wonders, with a strong hand, with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; 
JER.32.22	and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
JER.32.23	They came in and possessed it, but they didn’t obey your voice and didn’t walk in your law. They have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do. Therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them.
JER.32.24	“Behold, siege ramps have come to the city to take it. The city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, of the famine, and of the pestilence. What you have spoken has happened. Behold, you see it. 
JER.32.25	You have said to me, Lord GOD, ‘Buy the field for money, and call witnesses;’ whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”
JER.32.26	Then the 
JER.32.27	“Behold, I am the 
JER.32.28	Therefore the 
JER.32.29	The Chaldeans, who fight against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
JER.32.30	“For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says the 
JER.32.31	For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day, so that I should remove it from before my face, 
JER.32.32	because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger: they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
JER.32.33	They have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. Although I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction. 
JER.32.34	But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. 
JER.32.35	They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech, which I didn’t command them. It didn’t even come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.”
JER.32.36	Now therefore the 
JER.32.37	“Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place. I will cause them to dwell safely. 
JER.32.38	Then they will be my people, and I will be their God. 
JER.32.39	I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their good, and the good of their children after them. 
JER.32.40	I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me. 
JER.32.41	Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.”
JER.32.42	For the 
JER.32.43	Fields will be bought in this land, about which you say, ‘It is desolate, without man or animal. It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ 
JER.32.44	Men will buy fields for money, sign the deeds, seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed,” says the 
JER.33.1	Moreover the 
JER.33.2	“The 
JER.33.3	‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great and difficult things, which you don’t know.’ 
JER.33.4	For the 
JER.33.5	while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city: 
JER.33.6	‘Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth. 
JER.33.7	I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. 
JER.33.8	I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me and by which they have transgressed against me. 
JER.33.9	This city will be to me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I provide to it.’”
JER.33.10	The 
JER.33.11	the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, ‘Give thanks to the 
JER.33.12	The 
JER.33.13	In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of him who counts them,” says the 
JER.33.14	“Behold, the days come,” says the 
JER.33.15	“In those days and at that time,
JER.33.15	I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David.
JER.33.15	He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.
JER.33.16	In those days Judah will be saved,
JER.33.16	and Jerusalem will dwell safely.
JER.33.16	This is the name by which she will be called:
JER.33.16	The 
JER.33.17	For the 
JER.33.18	The Levitical priests won’t lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.”
JER.33.19	The 
JER.33.20	“The 
JER.33.21	then my covenant could also be broken with David my servant, that he won’t have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. 
JER.33.22	As the army of the sky can’t be counted, and the sand of the sea can’t be measured; so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’”
JER.33.23	The 
JER.33.24	“Don’t consider what this people has spoken, saying, ‘Has the 
JER.33.25	The 
JER.33.26	then I will also cast away the offspring of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have mercy on them.”
JER.34.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.2	“The 
JER.34.3	You won’t escape out of his hand, but will surely be taken and delivered into his hand. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth. You will go to Babylon.”’
JER.34.4	“Yet hear the 
JER.34.5	You will die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will make a burning for you. They will lament you, saying, “Ah Lord!” for I have spoken the word,’ says the 
JER.34.6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, 
JER.34.7	when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.
JER.34.8	The word came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.9	that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that no one should make bondservants of them, of a Jew his brother. 
JER.34.10	All the princes and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant, and everyone his female servant go free, that no one should make bondservants of them any more. They obeyed and let them go; 
JER.34.11	but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
JER.34.12	Therefore the 
JER.34.13	“The 
JER.34.14	At the end of seven years, every man of you shall release his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years. You shall let him go free from you; but your fathers didn’t listen to me, and didn’t incline their ear. 
JER.34.15	You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbour. You had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name; 
JER.34.16	but you turned and profaned my name, and every man caused his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return. You brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.’”
JER.34.17	Therefore the 
JER.34.18	I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts: 
JER.34.19	the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf; 
JER.34.20	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.
JER.34.21	“I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their life and into the hands of the king of Babylon’s army, who has gone away from you. 
JER.34.22	Behold, I will command,” says the 
JER.35.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.35.2	“Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the 
JER.35.3	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, with his brothers, all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; 
JER.35.4	and I brought them into the 
JER.35.5	I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!”
JER.35.6	But they said, “We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons, forever. 
JER.35.7	You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, or have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land in which you live as nomads.’ 
JER.35.8	We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters; 
JER.35.9	and not to build houses for ourselves to dwell in. We have no vineyard, field, or seed; 
JER.35.10	but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 
JER.35.11	But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, we said, ‘Come! Let’s go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we will dwell at Jerusalem.’”
JER.35.12	Then the 
JER.35.13	“The 
JER.35.14	“The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment; but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking, and you have not listened to me. 
JER.35.15	I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Every one of you must return now from his evil way, amend your doings, and don’t go after other gods to serve them, then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers:’ but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me. 
JER.35.16	The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me.”’
JER.35.17	“Therefore the 
JER.35.18	Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “The 
JER.35.19	therefore the 
JER.36.1	In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.36.2	“Take a scroll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day. 
JER.36.3	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them; that they may each return from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”
JER.36.4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the 
JER.36.5	Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted. I can’t go into the 
JER.36.6	Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, the 
JER.36.7	It may be they will present their supplication before the 
JER.36.8	Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the 
JER.36.9	Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before the 
JER.36.10	Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in the 
JER.36.11	When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the 
JER.36.12	he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s room: and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 
JER.36.13	Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 
JER.36.14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come.”
JER.36.14	So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them. 
JER.36.15	They said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.”
JER.36.15	So Baruch read it in their hearing.
JER.36.16	Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one towards another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.” 
JER.36.17	They asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words at his mouth?”
JER.36.18	Then Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”
JER.36.19	Then the princes said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah go hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”
JER.36.20	They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe. Then they told all the words in the hearing of the king. 
JER.36.21	So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king. 
JER.36.22	Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month; and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him. 
JER.36.23	When Jehudi had read three or four leaves, the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. 
JER.36.24	The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, and didn’t tear their garments. 
JER.36.25	Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them. 
JER.36.26	The king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but the 
JER.36.27	Then the 
JER.36.28	“Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burnt. 
JER.36.29	Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘The 
JER.36.30	Therefore the 
JER.36.31	I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn’t listen.”’”
JER.36.32	Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burnt in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.
JER.37.1	Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. 
JER.37.2	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, listened to the 
JER.37.3	Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Pray now to the 
JER.37.4	Now Jeremiah came in and went out amongst the people; for they had not put him into prison. 
JER.37.5	Pharaoh’s army had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem.
JER.37.6	Then the 
JER.37.7	“The 
JER.37.8	The Chaldeans will come again, and fight against this city. They will take it and burn it with fire.”’
JER.37.9	“The 
JER.37.10	For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and only wounded men remained amongst them, they would each rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.’”
JER.37.11	When the army of the Chaldeans had broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, 
JER.37.12	then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the middle of the people. 
JER.37.13	When he was in Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”
JER.37.14	Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.”
JER.37.14	But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah seized Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. 
JER.37.15	The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.
JER.37.16	When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days, 
JER.37.17	then Zedekiah the king sent, and had him brought out. The king asked him secretly in his house, “Is there any word from the 
JER.37.17	Jeremiah said, “There is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”
JER.37.18	Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you, nor against this land?’ 
JER.37.20	Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.”
JER.37.21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard. They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
JER.38.1	Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying, 
JER.38.2	“The 
JER.38.3	The 
JER.38.4	Then the princes said to the king, “Please let this man be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of this people, but harm.”
JER.38.5	Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king can’t do anything to oppose you.”
JER.38.6	Then they took Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard. They let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
JER.38.7	Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benjamin’s gate), 
JER.38.8	Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying, 
JER.38.9	“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.”
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.”
JER.38.11	So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. 
JER.38.12	Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords.”
JER.38.12	Jeremiah did so. 
JER.38.13	So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
JER.38.14	Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to himself into the third entry that is in the 
JER.38.15	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? If I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.”
JER.38.16	So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As the 
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “The 
JER.38.18	But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you won’t escape out of their hand.’”
JER.38.19	Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.”
JER.38.20	But Jeremiah said, “They won’t deliver you. Obey, I beg you, the 
JER.38.21	But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that the 
JER.38.22	‘Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house will be brought out to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women will say,
JER.38.22	“Your familiar friends have turned on you,
JER.38.22	and have prevailed over you.
JER.38.22	Your feet are sunk in the mire,
JER.38.22	they have turned away from you.”
JER.38.23	They will bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. You won’t escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. You will cause this city to be burnt with fire.’”
JER.38.24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and you won’t die. 
JER.38.25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also tell us what the king said to you;’ 
JER.38.26	then you shall tell them, ‘I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.’”
JER.38.27	Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
JER.38.28	So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
JER.39.1	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it. 
JER.39.2	In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city. 
JER.39.3	All the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon. 
JER.39.4	When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out towards the Arabah.
JER.39.5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgement on him. 
JER.39.6	Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons in Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah. 
JER.39.7	Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
JER.39.8	The Chaldeans burnt the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the residue of the people who remained. 
JER.39.10	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
JER.39.11	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying, 
JER.39.12	“Take him, and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as he tells you.”
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, with Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon; 
JER.39.14	they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home. So he lived amongst the people.
JER.39.15	Now the 
JER.39.16	“Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘The 
JER.39.17	But I will deliver you in that day,” says the 
JER.39.18	For I will surely save you, and you won’t fall by the sword, but you will escape with your life; because you have put your trust in me,” says the 
JER.40.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.40.2	The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, “The 
JER.40.3	and the 
JER.40.4	Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don’t. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to go, there go.” 
JER.40.5	Now while he had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him amongst the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go.”
JER.40.5	So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go. 
JER.40.6	Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him amongst the people who were left in the land.
JER.40.7	Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon; 
JER.40.8	then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men came to Gedaliah to Mizpah. 
JER.40.9	Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you. 
JER.40.10	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”
JER.40.11	Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and amongst the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; 
JER.40.12	then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits.
JER.40.13	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 
JER.40.14	and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?”
JER.40.14	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them.
JER.40.15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, “Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it. Why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?”
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael.”
JER.41.1	Now in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah. 
JER.41.2	Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.
JER.41.4	The second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it, 
JER.41.5	men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the 
JER.41.6	Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.” 
JER.41.7	It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him. 
JER.41.8	But ten men were found amongst those who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.”
JER.41.8	So he stopped, and didn’t kill them amongst their brothers. 
JER.41.9	Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (this was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed.
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael carried away captive all of the people who were left in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.
JER.41.11	But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 
JER.41.12	then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad. 
JER.41.14	So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.
JER.41.16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the men of war, with the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon. 
JER.41.17	They departed and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt 
JER.41.18	because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.
JER.42.1	Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near, 
JER.42.2	and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our supplication be presented before you, and pray for us to the 
JER.42.3	that the 
JER.42.4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to the 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the 
JER.42.6	Whether it is good, or whether it is bad, we will obey the voice of the 
JER.42.7	After ten days, the 
JER.42.8	Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, 
JER.42.9	and said to them, “The 
JER.42.10	‘If you will still live in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you. 
JER.42.11	Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Don’t be afraid of him,’ says the 
JER.42.12	I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land.
JER.42.13	“‘But if you say, “We will not dwell in this land;” so that you don’t obey the 
JER.42.14	saying, “No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there we will dwell:”’ 
JER.42.15	now therefore hear the 
JER.42.16	then it will happen that the sword, which you fear, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, will follow close behind you there in Egypt; and you will die there. 
JER.42.17	So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there. They will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. None of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.’ 
JER.42.18	For the 
JER.42.19	“The 
JER.42.20	For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to the 
JER.42.21	I have declared it to you today; but you have not obeyed the 
JER.42.22	Now therefore know certainly that you will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live there.”
JER.43.1	When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of the 
JER.43.2	then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely. The 
JER.43.3	but Baruch the son of Neriah has turned you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.”
JER.43.4	So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn’t obey the 
JER.43.5	But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah; 
JER.43.6	the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah; 
JER.43.7	and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn’t obey the 
JER.43.8	Then the 
JER.43.9	“Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; 
JER.43.10	and tell them, the 
JER.43.11	He will come, and will strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death will be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword. 
JER.43.12	I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt. He will burn them, and carry them away captive. He will array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he will go out from there in peace. 
JER.43.13	He will also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and he will burn the houses of the gods of Egypt with fire.’”
JER.44.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 
JER.44.2	“The 
JER.44.3	because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods that they didn’t know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers. 
JER.44.4	However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, “Oh, don’t do this abominable thing that I hate.” 
JER.44.5	But they didn’t listen and didn’t incline their ear. They didn’t turn from their wickedness, to stop burning incense to other gods. 
JER.44.6	Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is today.’
JER.44.7	“Therefore now the 
JER.44.8	in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to live; that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach amongst all the nations of the earth? 
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.’
JER.44.11	“Therefore the 
JER.44.12	I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there, and they will all be consumed. They will fall in the land of Egypt. They will be consumed by the sword and by the famine. They will die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine. They will be an object of horror, an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. 
JER.44.13	For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; 
JER.44.14	so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, will escape or be left to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there; for no one will return except those who will escape.’”
JER.44.15	Then all the men who knew that their wives burnt incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, 
JER.44.16	“As for the word that you have spoken to us in the 
JER.44.17	But we will certainly perform every word that has gone out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil. 
JER.44.18	But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of the sky, and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.”
JER.44.19	The women said, “When we burnt incense to the queen of the sky, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?”
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people who had given him an answer, saying, 
JER.44.21	“The incense that you burnt in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, didn’t the 
JER.44.22	Thus the 
JER.44.23	Because you have burnt incense, and because you have sinned against the 
JER.44.24	Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the 
JER.44.25	The 
JER.44.25	“‘Establish then your vows, and perform your vows.’
JER.44.26	“Therefore hear the 
JER.44.27	Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until they are all gone. 
JER.44.28	Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah few in number. All the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, will know whose word will stand, mine or theirs.
JER.44.29	“‘This will be the sign to you,’ says the 
JER.44.30	The 
JER.45.1	The message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, 
JER.45.2	“The 
JER.45.3	‘You said, “Woe is me now! For the 
JER.45.4	“You shall tell him, the 
JER.45.5	Do you seek great things for yourself? Don’t seek them; for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh,’ says the 
JER.46.1	The 
JER.46.2	Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.
JER.46.3	“Prepare the buckler and shield,
JER.46.3	and draw near to battle!
JER.46.4	Harness the horses, and get up, you horsemen,
JER.46.4	and stand up with your helmets.
JER.46.4	Polish the spears,
JER.46.4	put on the coats of mail.
JER.46.5	Why have I seen it?
JER.46.5	They are dismayed and are turned backward.
JER.46.5	Their mighty ones are beaten down,
JER.46.5	have fled in haste,
JER.46.5	and don’t look back.
JER.46.5	Terror is on every side,”
JER.46.5	says the 
JER.46.6	“Don’t let the swift flee away,
JER.46.6	nor the mighty man escape.
JER.46.6	In the north by the river Euphrates
JER.46.6	they have stumbled and fallen.
JER.46.7	“Who is this who rises up like the Nile,
JER.46.7	whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?
JER.46.8	Egypt rises up like the Nile,
JER.46.8	and his waters toss themselves like the rivers.
JER.46.8	He says, ‘I will rise up. I will cover the earth.
JER.46.8	I will destroy cities and its inhabitants.’
JER.46.9	Go up, you horses!
JER.46.9	Rage, you chariots!
JER.46.9	Let the mighty men go out:
JER.46.9	Cush and Put, who handle the shield;
JER.46.9	and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.
JER.46.10	For that day is of the Lord, the 
JER.46.10	a day of vengeance,
JER.46.10	that he may avenge himself of his adversaries.
JER.46.10	The sword will devour and be satiated,
JER.46.10	and will drink its fill of their blood;
JER.46.10	for the Lord, the 
JER.46.11	Go up into Gilead, and take balm, virgin daughter of Egypt.
JER.46.11	You use many medicines in vain.
JER.46.11	There is no healing for you.
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of your shame,
JER.46.12	and the earth is full of your cry;
JER.46.12	for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty,
JER.46.12	they both fall together.”
JER.46.13	The word that the 
JER.46.14	“Declare in Egypt,
JER.46.14	publish in Migdol,
JER.46.14	and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes:
JER.46.14	say, ‘Stand up, and prepare;
JER.46.14	for the sword has devoured around you.’
JER.46.15	Why are your strong ones swept away?
JER.46.15	They didn’t stand, because the 
JER.46.16	He made many to stumble.
JER.46.16	Yes, they fell on one another.
JER.46.16	They said, ‘Arise! Let’s go again to our own people,
JER.46.16	and to the land of our birth,
JER.46.16	from the oppressing sword.’
JER.46.17	They cried there, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise;
JER.46.17	he has let the appointed time pass by.’
JER.46.18	“As I live,” says the King,
JER.46.18	whose name is the 
JER.46.18	“surely like Tabor amongst the mountains,
JER.46.18	and like Carmel by the sea,
JER.46.18	so he will come.
JER.46.19	You daughter who dwells in Egypt,
JER.46.19	furnish yourself to go into captivity;
JER.46.19	for Memphis will become a desolation,
JER.46.19	and will be burnt up,
JER.46.19	without inhabitant.
JER.46.20	“Egypt is a very beautiful heifer;
JER.46.20	but destruction out of the north has come.
JER.46.20	It has come.
JER.46.21	Also her hired men in the middle of her are like calves of the stall;
JER.46.21	for they also are turned back.
JER.46.21	They have fled away together.
JER.46.21	They didn’t stand,
JER.46.21	for the day of their calamity has come on them,
JER.46.21	the time of their visitation.
JER.46.22	Its sound will go like the serpent;
JER.46.22	for they will march with an army,
JER.46.22	and come against her with axes, as wood cutters.
JER.46.23	They will cut down her forest,” says the 
JER.46.23	“though it can’t be searched;
JER.46.23	because they are more than the locusts,
JER.46.23	and are innumerable.
JER.46.24	The daughter of Egypt will be disappointed;
JER.46.24	she will be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.”
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. Afterwards it will be inhabited, as in the days of old,” says the 
JER.46.27	“But don’t you be afraid, Jacob my servant.
JER.46.27	Don’t be dismayed, Israel;
JER.46.27	for, behold, I will save you from afar,
JER.46.27	and your offspring from the land of their captivity.
JER.46.27	Jacob will return,
JER.46.27	and will be quiet and at ease.
JER.46.27	No one will make him afraid.
JER.46.28	Don’t be afraid, O Jacob my servant,” says the 
JER.46.28	“for I am with you;
JER.46.28	for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you;
JER.46.28	but I will not make a full end of you,
JER.46.28	but I will correct you in measure,
JER.46.28	and will in no way leave you unpunished.”
JER.47.1	The 
JER.47.2	The 
JER.47.2	“Behold, waters rise up out of the north,
JER.47.2	and will become an overflowing stream,
JER.47.2	and will overflow the land and all that is therein,
JER.47.2	the city and those who dwell therein.
JER.47.2	The men will cry,
JER.47.2	and all the inhabitants of the land will wail.
JER.47.3	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones,
JER.47.3	at the rushing of his chariots,
JER.47.3	at the rumbling of his wheels,
JER.47.3	the fathers don’t look back to their children
JER.47.3	for feebleness of hands;
JER.47.4	because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines,
JER.47.4	to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains;
JER.47.4	for the 
JER.47.4	the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.
JER.47.5	Baldness has come on Gaza;
JER.47.5	Ashkelon is brought to nothing,
JER.47.5	the remnant of their valley:
JER.47.5	how long will you cut yourself?
JER.47.6	“‘You sword of the 
JER.47.6	Put yourself back into your scabbard;
JER.47.6	rest, and be still.’
JER.47.7	“How can you be quiet,
JER.47.7	since the 
JER.47.7	Against Ashkelon, and against the seashore,
JER.47.7	there he has appointed it.”
JER.48.1	Of Moab. The 
JER.48.1	“Woe to Nebo!
JER.48.1	For it is laid waste.
JER.48.1	Kiriathaim is disappointed.
JER.48.1	It is taken.
JER.48.1	Misgab
JER.48.1	and broken down.
JER.48.2	The praise of Moab is no more.
JER.48.2	In Heshbon they have devised evil against her:
JER.48.2	‘Come! Let’s cut her off from being a nation.’
JER.48.2	You also, Madmen, will be brought to silence.
JER.48.2	The sword will pursue you.
JER.48.3	The sound of a cry from Horonaim,
JER.48.3	desolation and great destruction!
JER.48.4	Moab is destroyed.
JER.48.4	Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
JER.48.5	For they will go up by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping.
JER.48.5	For at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.
JER.48.6	Flee! Save your lives!
JER.48.6	Be like the juniper bush in the wilderness.
JER.48.7	For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures,
JER.48.7	you also will be taken.
JER.48.7	Chemosh will go out into captivity,
JER.48.7	his priests and his princes together.
JER.48.8	The destroyer will come on every city,
JER.48.8	and no city will escape;
JER.48.8	the valley also will perish,
JER.48.8	and the plain will be destroyed; as the 
JER.48.9	Give wings to Moab,
JER.48.9	that she may fly and get herself away:
JER.48.9	and her cities will become a desolation,
JER.48.9	without anyone to dwell in them.
JER.48.10	“Cursed is he who does the work of the 
JER.48.10	and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.
JER.48.11	“Moab has been at ease from his youth,
JER.48.11	and he has settled on his lees,
JER.48.11	and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
JER.48.11	neither has he gone into captivity:
JER.48.11	therefore his taste remains in him,
JER.48.11	and his scent is not changed.
JER.48.12	Therefore behold, the days come,” says the 
JER.48.12	“that I will send to him those who pour off,
JER.48.12	and they will pour him off;
JER.48.12	and they will empty his vessels,
JER.48.12	and break their containers in pieces.
JER.48.13	Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,
JER.48.13	as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.
JER.48.14	“How do you say, ‘We are mighty men,
JER.48.14	and valiant men for the war’?
JER.48.15	Moab is laid waste,
JER.48.15	and they have gone up into his cities,
JER.48.15	and his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter,”
JER.48.15	says the King, whose name is the 
JER.48.16	“The calamity of Moab is near to come,
JER.48.16	and his affliction hurries fast.
JER.48.17	All you who are around him, bemoan him,
JER.48.17	and all you who know his name; say,
JER.48.17	‘How the strong staff is broken,
JER.48.17	the beautiful rod!’
JER.48.18	“You daughter who dwells in Dibon,
JER.48.18	come down from your glory,
JER.48.18	and sit in thirst;
JER.48.18	for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you.
JER.48.18	He has destroyed your strongholds.
JER.48.19	Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch.
JER.48.19	Ask him who flees, and her who escapes;
JER.48.19	say, ‘What has been done?’
JER.48.20	Moab is disappointed;
JER.48.20	for it is broken down.
JER.48.20	Wail and cry!
JER.48.20	Tell it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
JER.48.21	Judgement has come on the plain country,
JER.48.21	on Holon, on Jahzah, on Mephaath,
JER.48.22	on Dibon, on Nebo, on Beth Diblathaim,
JER.48.23	on Kiriathaim, on Beth Gamul, on Beth Meon,
JER.48.24	on Kerioth, on Bozrah,
JER.48.24	and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
JER.48.25	The horn of Moab is cut off,
JER.48.25	and his arm is broken,” says the 
JER.48.26	“Make him drunken;
JER.48.26	for he magnified himself against the 
JER.48.26	Moab will wallow in his vomit,
JER.48.26	and he also will be in derision.
JER.48.27	For wasn’t Israel a derision to you?
JER.48.27	Was he found amongst thieves?
JER.48.27	For as often as you speak of him,
JER.48.27	you shake your head.
JER.48.28	You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock.
JER.48.28	Be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.
JER.48.29	“We have heard of the pride of Moab.
JER.48.29	He is very proud in his loftiness, his pride,
JER.48.29	his arrogance, and the arrogance of his heart.
JER.48.30	I know his wrath,” says the 
JER.48.30	his boastings have done nothing.
JER.48.31	Therefore I will wail for Moab.
JER.48.31	Yes, I will cry out for all Moab.
JER.48.31	They will mourn for the men of Kir Heres.
JER.48.32	With more than the weeping of Jazer
JER.48.32	I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah.
JER.48.32	Your branches passed over the sea.
JER.48.32	They reached even to the sea of Jazer.
JER.48.32	The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruits
JER.48.32	and on your vintage.
JER.48.33	Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field
JER.48.33	and from the land of Moab.
JER.48.33	I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses.
JER.48.33	No one will tread with shouting.
JER.48.33	The shouting will be no shouting.
JER.48.34	From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh,
JER.48.34	even to Jahaz they have uttered their voice,
JER.48.34	from Zoar even to Horonaim, to Eglath Shelishiyah;
JER.48.34	for the waters of Nimrim will also become desolate.
JER.48.35	Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab,” says the 
JER.48.35	“him who offers in the high place,
JER.48.35	and him who burns incense to his gods.
JER.48.36	Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes,
JER.48.36	and my heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir Heres.
JER.48.36	Therefore the abundance that he has gotten has perished.
JER.48.37	For every head is bald,
JER.48.37	and every beard clipped.
JER.48.37	There are cuttings on all the hands,
JER.48.37	and sackcloth on the waist.
JER.48.38	On all the housetops of Moab,
JER.48.38	and in its streets, there is lamentation everywhere;
JER.48.38	for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one delights,” says the 
JER.48.39	“How it is broken down!
JER.48.39	How they wail!
JER.48.39	How Moab has turned the back with shame!
JER.48.39	So will Moab become a derision
JER.48.39	and a terror to all who are around him.”
JER.48.40	For the 
JER.48.40	and will spread out his wings against Moab.
JER.48.41	Kerioth is taken,
JER.48.41	and the strongholds are seized.
JER.48.41	The heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day
JER.48.41	will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
JER.48.42	Moab will be destroyed from being a people,
JER.48.42	because he has magnified himself against the 
JER.48.43	Terror, the pit, and the snare are on you,
JER.48.43	inhabitant of Moab,” says the 
JER.48.44	“He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit;
JER.48.44	and he who gets up out of the pit will be taken in the snare:
JER.48.44	for I will bring on him, even on Moab,
JER.48.44	the year of their visitation,” says the 
JER.48.45	“Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;
JER.48.45	for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,
JER.48.45	and a flame from the middle of Sihon,
JER.48.45	and has devoured the corner of Moab,
JER.48.45	and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
JER.48.46	Woe to you, O Moab!
JER.48.46	The people of Chemosh are undone;
JER.48.46	for your sons are taken away captive,
JER.48.46	and your daughters into captivity.
JER.48.47	“Yet I will reverse the captivity of Moab in the latter days,”
JER.48.47	says the 
JER.48.47	Thus far is the judgement of Moab.
JER.49.1	Of the children of Ammon. The 
JER.49.1	“Has Israel no sons?
JER.49.1	Has he no heir?
JER.49.1	Why then does Malcam possess Gad,
JER.49.1	and his people dwell in its cities?
JER.49.2	Therefore behold, the days come,”
JER.49.2	says the 
JER.49.2	“that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon;
JER.49.2	and it will become a desolate heap,
JER.49.2	and her daughters will be burnt with fire:
JER.49.2	then Israel will possess those who possessed him,”
JER.49.2	says the 
JER.49.3	“Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste!
JER.49.3	Cry, you daughters of Rabbah!
JER.49.3	Clothe yourself in sackcloth.
JER.49.3	Lament, and run back and forth amongst the fences;
JER.49.3	for Malcam will go into captivity,
JER.49.3	his priests and his princes together.
JER.49.4	Why do you boast in the valleys,
JER.49.4	your flowing valley, backsliding daughter?
JER.49.4	You trusted in her treasures,
JER.49.4	saying, ‘Who will come to me?’
JER.49.5	Behold, I will bring a terror on you,”
JER.49.5	says the Lord, the 
JER.49.5	“from all who are around you.
JER.49.5	All of you will be driven completely out,
JER.49.5	and there will be no one to gather together the fugitives.
JER.49.6	“But afterward I will reverse the captivity of the children of Ammon,”
JER.49.6	says the 
JER.49.7	Of Edom, the 
JER.49.7	“Is wisdom no more in Teman?
JER.49.7	Has counsel perished from the prudent?
JER.49.7	Has their wisdom vanished?
JER.49.8	Flee! Turn back!
JER.49.8	Dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan;
JER.49.8	for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him when I visit him.
JER.49.9	If grape gatherers came to you,
JER.49.9	would they not leave some gleaning grapes?
JER.49.9	If thieves came by night,
JER.49.9	wouldn’t they steal until they had enough?
JER.49.10	But I have made Esau bare,
JER.49.10	I have uncovered his secret places,
JER.49.10	and he will not be able to hide himself.
JER.49.10	His offspring is destroyed,
JER.49.10	with his brothers and his neighbours;
JER.49.10	and he is no more.
JER.49.11	Leave your fatherless children.
JER.49.11	I will preserve them alive.
JER.49.11	Let your widows trust in me.”
JER.49.12	For the 
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by myself,” says the 
JER.49.14	I have heard news from the 
JER.49.14	and an ambassador is sent amongst the nations,
JER.49.14	saying, “Gather yourselves together!
JER.49.14	Come against her!
JER.49.14	Rise up to the battle!”
JER.49.15	“For, behold, I have made you small amongst the nations,
JER.49.15	and despised amongst men.
JER.49.16	As for your terror,
JER.49.16	the pride of your heart has deceived you,
JER.49.16	O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,
JER.49.16	who hold the height of the hill,
JER.49.16	though you should make your nest as high as the eagle,
JER.49.16	I will bring you down from there,” says the 
JER.49.17	“Edom will become an astonishment.
JER.49.17	Everyone who passes by it will be astonished,
JER.49.17	and will hiss at all its plagues.
JER.49.18	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and its neighbour cities,” says the 
JER.49.18	“no man will dwell there,
JER.49.18	neither will any son of man live therein.
JER.49.19	“Behold, he will come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation:
JER.49.19	for I will suddenly make them run away from it;
JER.49.19	and whoever is chosen,
JER.49.19	I will appoint him over it.
JER.49.19	For who is like me?
JER.49.19	Who will appoint me a time?
JER.49.19	Who is the shepherd who will stand before me?”
JER.49.20	Therefore hear the counsel of the 
JER.49.20	and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman:
JER.49.20	Surely they will drag them away,
JER.49.20	the little ones of the flock.
JER.49.20	Surely he will make their habitation desolate over them.
JER.49.21	The earth trembles at the noise of their fall;
JER.49.21	there is a cry, the noise which is heard in the Red Sea.
JER.49.22	Behold, he will come up and fly as the eagle,
JER.49.22	and spread out his wings against Bozrah.
JER.49.22	The heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
JER.49.23	Of Damascus:
JER.49.23	“Hamath is confounded, and Arpad;
JER.49.23	for they have heard evil news.
JER.49.23	They have melted away.
JER.49.23	There is sorrow on the sea.
JER.49.23	It can’t be quiet.
JER.49.24	Damascus has grown feeble,
JER.49.24	she turns herself to flee,
JER.49.24	and trembling has seized her.
JER.49.24	Anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her,
JER.49.24	as of a woman in travail.
JER.49.25	How is the city of praise not forsaken,
JER.49.25	the city of my joy?
JER.49.26	Therefore her young men will fall in her streets,
JER.49.26	and all the men of war will be brought to silence in that day,”
JER.49.26	says the 
JER.49.27	“I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus,
JER.49.27	and it will devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.”
JER.49.28	Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck. The 
JER.49.28	“Arise, go up to Kedar,
JER.49.28	and destroy the children of the east.
JER.49.29	They will take their tents and their flocks.
JER.49.29	they will carry away for themselves their curtains,
JER.49.29	all their vessels, and their camels;
JER.49.29	and they will cry to them, ‘Terror on every side!’
JER.49.30	Flee!
JER.49.30	Wander far off!
JER.49.30	Dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Hazor,” says the 
JER.49.30	“for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you,
JER.49.30	and has conceived a purpose against you.
JER.49.31	Arise! Go up to a nation that is at ease,
JER.49.31	that dwells without care,” says the 
JER.49.31	“that has neither gates nor bars,
JER.49.31	that dwells alone.
JER.49.32	Their camels will be a booty,
JER.49.32	and the multitude of their livestock a plunder.
JER.49.32	I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their beards cut off;
JER.49.32	and I will bring their calamity from every side of them,”
JER.49.32	says the 
JER.49.33	Hazor will be a dwelling place of jackals,
JER.49.33	a desolation forever.
JER.49.33	No man will dwell there,
JER.49.33	neither will any son of man live therein.”
JER.49.34	The 
JER.49.35	“The 
JER.49.35	‘Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,
JER.49.35	the chief of their might.
JER.49.36	I will bring on Elam the four winds from the four quarters of the sky,
JER.49.36	and will scatter them towards all those winds.
JER.49.36	There will be no nation where the outcasts of Elam will not come.
JER.49.37	I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies,
JER.49.37	and before those who seek their life.
JER.49.37	I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger,’ says the 
JER.49.37	‘and I will send the sword after them,
JER.49.37	until I have consumed them.
JER.49.38	I will set my throne in Elam,
JER.49.38	and will destroy from there king and princes,’ says the 
JER.49.39	‘But it will happen in the latter days
JER.49.39	that I will reverse the captivity of Elam,’ says the 
JER.50.1	The word that the 
JER.50.2	“Declare amongst the nations and publish,
JER.50.2	and set up a standard;
JER.50.2	publish, and don’t conceal:
JER.50.2	say, ‘Babylon has been taken,
JER.50.2	Bel is disappointed,
JER.50.2	Merodach is dismayed!
JER.50.2	Her images are disappointed.
JER.50.2	Her idols are dismayed.’
JER.50.3	For a nation comes up out of the north against her,
JER.50.3	which will make her land desolate,
JER.50.3	and no one will dwell in it.
JER.50.3	They have fled.
JER.50.3	They are gone,
JER.50.3	both man and animal.
JER.50.4	“In those days, and in that time,” says the 
JER.50.4	“the children of Israel will come,
JER.50.4	they and the children of Judah together;
JER.50.4	they will go on their way weeping,
JER.50.4	and will seek the 
JER.50.5	They will enquire concerning Zion with their faces turned towards it,
JER.50.5	saying, ‘Come, and join yourselves to the 
JER.50.5	that will not be forgotten.’
JER.50.6	My people have been lost sheep.
JER.50.6	Their shepherds have caused them to go astray.
JER.50.6	They have turned them away on the mountains.
JER.50.6	They have gone from mountain to hill.
JER.50.6	They have forgotten their resting place.
JER.50.7	All who found them have devoured them.
JER.50.7	Their adversaries said, ‘We are not guilty,
JER.50.7	because they have sinned against the 
JER.50.7	the habitation of righteousness,
JER.50.7	even the 
JER.50.8	“Flee out of the middle of Babylon!
JER.50.8	Go out of the land of the Chaldeans,
JER.50.8	and be as the male goats before the flocks.
JER.50.9	For, behold, I will stir up
JER.50.9	and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country;
JER.50.9	and they will set themselves in array against her.
JER.50.9	She will be taken from there.
JER.50.9	Their arrows will be as of an expert mighty man.
JER.50.9	None of them will return in vain.
JER.50.10	Chaldea will be a prey.
JER.50.10	All who prey on her will be satisfied,” says the 
JER.50.11	“Because you are glad,
JER.50.11	because you rejoice,
JER.50.11	O you who plunder my heritage,
JER.50.11	because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain,
JER.50.11	and neigh as strong horses;
JER.50.12	your mother will be utterly disappointed.
JER.50.12	She who bore you will be confounded.
JER.50.12	Behold, she will be the least of the nations,
JER.50.12	a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
JER.50.13	Because of the 
JER.50.13	but she will be wholly desolate.
JER.50.13	Everyone who goes by Babylon will be astonished,
JER.50.13	and hiss at all her plagues.
JER.50.14	Set yourselves in array against Babylon all around,
JER.50.14	all you who bend the bow;
JER.50.14	shoot at her.
JER.50.14	Spare no arrows;
JER.50.14	for she has sinned against the 
JER.50.15	Shout against her all around.
JER.50.15	She has submitted herself.
JER.50.15	Her bulwarks have fallen.
JER.50.15	Her walls have been thrown down,
JER.50.15	for it is the vengeance of the 
JER.50.15	Take vengeance on her.
JER.50.15	As she has done, do to her.
JER.50.16	Cut off the sower from Babylon,
JER.50.16	and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest.
JER.50.16	For fear of the oppressing sword,
JER.50.16	they will each return to their own people,
JER.50.16	and they will each flee to their own land.
JER.50.17	“Israel is a hunted sheep.
JER.50.17	The lions have driven him away.
JER.50.17	First, the king of Assyria devoured him,
JER.50.17	and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.”
JER.50.18	Therefore the 
JER.50.18	“Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land,
JER.50.18	as I have punished the king of Assyria.
JER.50.19	I will bring Israel again to his pasture,
JER.50.19	and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan.
JER.50.19	His soul will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
JER.50.20	In those days, and in that time,” says the 
JER.50.20	“the iniquity of Israel will be sought for,
JER.50.20	and there will be none;
JER.50.20	also the sins of Judah,
JER.50.20	and they won’t be found;
JER.50.20	for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.
JER.50.21	“Go up against the land of Merathaim,
JER.50.21	even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod.
JER.50.21	Kill and utterly destroy after them,” says the 
JER.50.21	“and do according to all that I have commanded you.
JER.50.22	A sound of battle is in the land,
JER.50.22	and of great destruction.
JER.50.23	How the hammer of the whole earth is cut apart and broken!
JER.50.23	How Babylon has become a desolation amongst the nations!
JER.50.24	I have laid a snare for you,
JER.50.24	and you are also taken, Babylon,
JER.50.24	and you weren’t aware.
JER.50.24	You are found,
JER.50.24	and also caught,
JER.50.24	because you have fought against the 
JER.50.25	The 
JER.50.25	and has brought out the weapons of his indignation;
JER.50.25	for the Lord, the 
JER.50.26	Come against her from the farthest border.
JER.50.26	Open her storehouses.
JER.50.26	Cast her up as heaps.
JER.50.26	Destroy her utterly.
JER.50.26	Let nothing of her be left.
JER.50.27	Kill all her bulls.
JER.50.27	Let them go down to the slaughter.
JER.50.27	Woe to them! For their day has come,
JER.50.27	the time of their visitation.
JER.50.28	Listen to those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon,
JER.50.28	to declare in Zion the vengeance of the 
JER.50.28	the vengeance of his temple.
JER.50.29	“Call together the archers against Babylon,
JER.50.29	all those who bend the bow.
JER.50.29	Encamp against her all around.
JER.50.29	Let none of it escape.
JER.50.29	Pay her back according to her work.
JER.50.29	According to all that she has done, do to her;
JER.50.29	for she has been proud against the 
JER.50.29	against the Holy One of Israel.
JER.50.30	Therefore her young men will fall in her streets.
JER.50.30	All her men of war will be brought to silence in that day,” says the 
JER.50.31	“Behold, I am against you, you proud one,” says the Lord, the 
JER.50.31	“for your day has come,
JER.50.31	the time that I will visit you.
JER.50.32	The proud one will stumble and fall,
JER.50.32	and no one will raise him up.
JER.50.32	I will kindle a fire in his cities,
JER.50.32	and it will devour all who are around him.”
JER.50.33	The 
JER.50.33	All who took them captive hold them fast.
JER.50.33	They refuse to let them go.
JER.50.34	Their Redeemer is strong:
JER.50.34	The 
JER.50.34	He will thoroughly plead their cause,
JER.50.34	that he may give rest to the earth,
JER.50.34	and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
JER.50.35	“A sword is on the Chaldeans,” says the 
JER.50.35	“and on the inhabitants of Babylon,
JER.50.35	on her princes,
JER.50.35	and on her wise men.
JER.50.36	A sword is on the boasters,
JER.50.36	and they will become fools.
JER.50.36	A sword is on her mighty men,
JER.50.36	and they will be dismayed.
JER.50.37	A sword is on their horses,
JER.50.37	on their chariots,
JER.50.37	and on all the mixed people who are in the middle of her;
JER.50.37	and they will become as women.
JER.50.37	A sword is on her treasures,
JER.50.37	and they will be robbed.
JER.50.38	A drought is on her waters,
JER.50.38	and they will be dried up;
JER.50.38	for it is a land of engraved images,
JER.50.38	and they are mad over idols.
JER.50.39	Therefore the wild animals of the desert
JER.50.39	with the wolves will dwell there.
JER.50.39	The ostriches will dwell therein;
JER.50.39	and it will be inhabited no more forever;
JER.50.39	neither will it be lived in from generation to generation.
JER.50.40	As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and its neighbour cities,” says the 
JER.50.40	“so no man will dwell there,
JER.50.40	neither will any son of man live therein.
JER.50.41	“Behold, a people comes from the north;
JER.50.41	and a great nation and many kings will be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
JER.50.42	They take up bow and spear.
JER.50.42	They are cruel, and have no mercy.
JER.50.42	Their voice roars like the sea.
JER.50.42	They ride on horses,
JER.50.42	everyone set in array,
JER.50.42	as a man to the battle,
JER.50.42	against you, daughter of Babylon.
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon has heard the news of them,
JER.50.43	and his hands become feeble:
JER.50.43	anguish has taken hold of him,
JER.50.43	pains as of a woman in labour.
JER.50.44	Behold, the enemy will come up like a lion
JER.50.44	from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation;
JER.50.44	for I will suddenly make them run away from it.
JER.50.44	Whoever is chosen,
JER.50.44	I will appoint him over it;
JER.50.44	for who is like me?
JER.50.44	Who will appoint me a time?
JER.50.44	Who is the shepherd who can stand before me?”
JER.50.45	Therefore hear the counsel of the 
JER.50.45	that he has taken against Babylon;
JER.50.45	and his purposes,
JER.50.45	that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans:
JER.50.45	Surely they will drag them away,
JER.50.45	even the little ones of the flock.
JER.50.45	Surely he will make their habitation desolate over them.
JER.50.46	At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles;
JER.50.46	and the cry is heard amongst the nations.
JER.51.1	The 
JER.51.1	“Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,
JER.51.1	and against those who dwell in Lebkamai, a destroying wind.
JER.51.2	I will send to Babylon strangers, who will winnow her.
JER.51.2	They will empty her land;
JER.51.2	for in the day of trouble they will be against her all around.
JER.51.3	Against him who bends, let the archer bend his bow,
JER.51.3	also against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail.
JER.51.3	Don’t spare her young men!
JER.51.3	Utterly destroy all her army!
JER.51.4	They will fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans,
JER.51.4	and thrust through in her streets.
JER.51.5	For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, by his God,
JER.51.5	by the 
JER.51.5	though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
JER.51.6	“Flee out of the middle of Babylon!
JER.51.6	Everyone save his own life!
JER.51.6	Don’t be cut off in her iniquity;
JER.51.6	for it is the time of the 
JER.51.6	He will render to her a recompense.
JER.51.7	Babylon has been a golden cup in the 
JER.51.7	who made all the earth drunk.
JER.51.7	The nations have drunk of her wine;
JER.51.7	therefore the nations have gone mad.
JER.51.8	Babylon has suddenly fallen and been destroyed!
JER.51.8	Wail for her!
JER.51.8	Take balm for her pain.
JER.51.8	Perhaps she may be healed.
JER.51.9	“We would have healed Babylon,
JER.51.9	but she is not healed.
JER.51.9	Forsake her,
JER.51.9	and let’s each go into his own country;
JER.51.9	for her judgement reaches to heaven,
JER.51.9	and is lifted up even to the skies.

JER.51.11	Hold the shields firmly!
JER.51.11	The 
JER.51.11	because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it;
JER.51.11	for it is the vengeance of the 
JER.51.11	the vengeance of his temple.
JER.51.12	Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon!
JER.51.12	Make the watch strong!
JER.51.12	Set the watchmen,
JER.51.12	and prepare the ambushes;
JER.51.12	for the 
JER.51.12	that which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
JER.51.13	You who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures,
JER.51.13	your end has come, the measure of your covetousness.
JER.51.14	The 
JER.51.14	‘Surely I will fill you with men,
JER.51.14	as with the canker worm;

JER.51.15	“He has made the earth by his power.
JER.51.15	He has established the world by his wisdom.
JER.51.15	By his understanding he has stretched out the heavens.
JER.51.16	When he utters his voice,
JER.51.16	there is a roar of waters in the heavens,
JER.51.16	and he causes the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth.
JER.51.16	He makes lightning for the rain,
JER.51.16	and brings the wind out of his treasuries.
JER.51.17	“Every man has become brutish without knowledge.
JER.51.17	Every goldsmith is disappointed by his image;
JER.51.17	for his molten image is falsehood,
JER.51.17	and there is no breath in them.
JER.51.18	They are vanity,
JER.51.18	a work of delusion.
JER.51.18	In the time of their visitation, they will perish.
JER.51.19	The portion of Jacob is not like these,
JER.51.19	for he is the former of all things;
JER.51.19	including the tribe of his inheritance:
JER.51.19	The 
JER.51.20	“You are my battle axe and weapons of war.
JER.51.20	With you I will break the nations into pieces.

JER.51.21	the horse and his rider.
JER.51.22	With you I will break in pieces
JER.51.22	the chariot and him who rides therein.
JER.51.22	With you I will break in pieces
JER.51.22	man and woman.
JER.51.22	With you I will break in pieces
JER.51.22	the old man and the youth.
JER.51.22	With you I will break in pieces
JER.51.22	the young man and the virgin.
JER.51.23	With you I will break in pieces
JER.51.23	the shepherd and his flock.
JER.51.23	With you I will break in pieces
JER.51.23	the farmer and his yoke.
JER.51.23	With you I will break in pieces
JER.51.23	governors and deputies.
JER.51.24	“I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight,” says the 
JER.51.25	“Behold, I am against you, destroying mountain,” says the 
JER.51.25	“which destroys all the earth.
JER.51.25	I will stretch out my hand on you,

JER.51.25	and will make you a burnt mountain.
JER.51.26	They won’t take a cornerstone from you,
JER.51.26	nor a stone for foundations;
JER.51.26	but you will be desolate forever,” says the 
JER.51.27	“Set up a standard in the land!
JER.51.27	Blow the trumpet amongst the nations!
JER.51.27	Prepare the nations against her!
JER.51.27	Call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz!
JER.51.27	Appoint a marshal against her!
JER.51.27	Cause the horses to come up as the rough canker worm!
JER.51.28	Prepare against her the nations,
JER.51.28	the kings of the Medes, its governors, and all its deputies, and all the land of their dominion!
JER.51.29	The land trembles and is in pain;
JER.51.29	for the purposes of the 
JER.51.29	to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.
JER.51.30	The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting,
JER.51.30	they remain in their strongholds.
JER.51.30	Their might has failed.
JER.51.30	They have become as women.
JER.51.30	Her dwelling places are set on fire.
JER.51.30	Her bars are broken.
JER.51.31	One runner will run to meet another,
JER.51.31	and one messenger to meet another,
JER.51.31	to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter.
JER.51.32	So the passages are seized.
JER.51.32	They have burnt the reeds with fire.
JER.51.32	The men of war are frightened.”
JER.51.33	For the 
JER.51.33	“The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden.
JER.51.33	Yet a little while, and the time of harvest comes for her.”
JER.51.34	“Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me.
JER.51.34	He has crushed me.
JER.51.34	He has made me an empty vessel.
JER.51.34	He has, like a monster, swallowed me up.
JER.51.34	He has filled his mouth with my delicacies.
JER.51.34	He has cast me out.
JER.51.35	May the violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon!”
JER.51.35	the inhabitant of Zion will say; and,
JER.51.35	“May my blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea!”
JER.51.35	will Jerusalem say.
JER.51.36	Therefore the 
JER.51.36	“Behold, I will plead your cause,
JER.51.36	and take vengeance for you.
JER.51.36	I will dry up her sea,
JER.51.36	and make her fountain dry.
JER.51.37	Babylon will become heaps,
JER.51.37	a dwelling place for jackals,
JER.51.37	an astonishment, and a hissing,
JER.51.37	without inhabitant.
JER.51.38	They will roar together like young lions.
JER.51.38	They will growl as lions’ cubs.
JER.51.39	When they are heated, I will make their feast,
JER.51.39	and I will make them drunk,
JER.51.39	that they may rejoice,
JER.51.39	and sleep a perpetual sleep,
JER.51.39	and not wake up,” says the 
JER.51.40	“I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,
JER.51.40	like rams with male goats.
JER.51.41	“How Sheshach is taken!
JER.51.41	How the praise of the whole earth is seized!
JER.51.41	How Babylon has become a desolation amongst the nations!
JER.51.42	The sea has come up on Babylon.
JER.51.42	She is covered with the multitude of its waves.
JER.51.43	Her cities have become a desolation,
JER.51.43	a dry land, and a desert,
JER.51.43	a land in which no man dwells.
JER.51.43	No son of man passes by it.
JER.51.44	I will execute judgement on Bel in Babylon,
JER.51.44	and I will bring out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up.
JER.51.44	The nations will not flow any more to him.
JER.51.44	Yes, the wall of Babylon will fall.
JER.51.45	“My people, go away from the middle of her,
JER.51.45	and each of you save yourselves from the 
JER.51.46	Don’t let your heart faint.
JER.51.46	Don’t fear for the news that will be heard in the land.
JER.51.46	For news will come one year,
JER.51.46	and after that in another year news will come,
JER.51.46	and violence in the land,
JER.51.46	ruler against ruler.
JER.51.47	Therefore behold, the days come that I will execute judgement on the engraved images of Babylon;
JER.51.47	and her whole land will be confounded.
JER.51.47	All her slain will fall in the middle of her.
JER.51.48	Then the heavens and the earth,
JER.51.48	and all that is therein,
JER.51.48	will sing for joy over Babylon;
JER.51.48	for the destroyers will come to her from the north,” says the 
JER.51.49	“As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall,
JER.51.49	so the slain of all the land will fall at Babylon.
JER.51.50	You who have escaped the sword, go!
JER.51.50	Don’t stand still!
JER.51.50	Remember the 
JER.51.50	and let Jerusalem come into your mind.”
JER.51.51	“We are confounded,
JER.51.51	because we have heard reproach.
JER.51.51	Confusion has covered our faces,
JER.51.51	for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of the

JER.51.52	“that I will execute judgement on her engraved images;
JER.51.52	and through all her land the wounded will groan.
JER.51.53	Though Babylon should mount up to the sky,
JER.51.53	and though she should fortify the height of her strength,
JER.51.53	yet destroyers will come to her from me,” says the 
JER.51.54	“The sound of a cry comes from Babylon,
JER.51.54	and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
JER.51.55	For the 
JER.51.55	and destroys out of her the great voice!
JER.51.55	Their waves roar like many waters.
JER.51.55	The noise of their voice is uttered.
JER.51.56	For the destroyer has come on her,
JER.51.56	even on Babylon.
JER.51.56	Her mighty men are taken.
JER.51.56	Their bows are broken in pieces,
JER.51.56	for the 
JER.51.56	He will surely repay.
JER.51.57	I will make her princes, her wise men,
JER.51.57	her governors, her deputies, and her mighty men drunk.
JER.51.57	They will sleep a perpetual sleep,
JER.51.57	and not wake up,”
JER.51.57	says the King, whose name is the 
JER.51.58	The 
JER.51.58	“The wide walls of Babylon will be utterly overthrown.
JER.51.58	Her high gates will be burnt with fire.
JER.51.58	The peoples will labour for vanity,
JER.51.58	and the nations for the fire;
JER.51.58	and they will be weary.”
JER.51.59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster. 
JER.51.60	Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon. 
JER.51.61	Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words, 
JER.51.62	and say, ‘
JER.51.63	It will be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of the Euphrates. 
JER.51.64	Then you shall say, ‘Thus will Babylon sink, and will not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her; and they will be weary.’”
JER.51.64	Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign. He reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
JER.52.2	He did that which was evil in the 
JER.52.3	For through the 
JER.52.3	Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
JER.52.4	In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about. 
JER.52.5	So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
JER.52.6	In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. 
JER.52.7	Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden. Now the Chaldeans were against the city all around. The men of war went towards the Arabah, 
JER.52.8	but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. 
JER.52.9	Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgement on him. 
JER.52.10	The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
JER.52.11	He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.
JER.52.12	Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem. 
JER.52.13	He burnt the 
JER.52.14	All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around. 
JER.52.15	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude. 
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.
JER.52.17	The Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in the 
JER.52.18	They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered. 
JER.52.19	The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lamp stands, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver.
JER.52.20	They took the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the 
JER.52.21	As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits;
JER.52.22	A capital of bronze was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits,
JER.52.23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around.
JER.52.24	The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold: 
JER.52.25	and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city. 
JER.52.26	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
JER.52.27	The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath.
JER.52.27	So Judah was carried away captive out of his land. 
JER.52.28	This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive:
JER.52.28	in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;
JER.52.29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;
JER.52.30	in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five people:
JER.52.30	all the people were four thousand and six hundred.
JER.52.31	In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and released him from prison. 
JER.52.32	He spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon, 
JER.52.33	and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life. 
JER.52.34	For his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
LAM.1.1	How the city sits solitary,
LAM.1.1	that was full of people!
LAM.1.1	She has become as a widow,
LAM.1.1	who was great amongst the nations!
LAM.1.1	She who was a princess amongst the provinces
LAM.1.1	has become a slave!
LAM.1.2	She weeps bitterly in the night.
LAM.1.2	Her tears are on her cheeks.
LAM.1.2	Amongst all her lovers
LAM.1.2	she has no one to comfort her.
LAM.1.2	All her friends have dealt treacherously with her.
LAM.1.2	They have become her enemies.
LAM.1.3	Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction,
LAM.1.3	and because of great servitude.
LAM.1.3	She dwells amongst the nations.
LAM.1.3	She finds no rest.
LAM.1.3	All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.
LAM.1.4	The roads to Zion mourn,
LAM.1.4	because no one comes to the solemn assembly.
LAM.1.4	All her gates are desolate.
LAM.1.4	Her priests sigh.
LAM.1.4	Her virgins are afflicted,
LAM.1.4	and she herself is in bitterness.
LAM.1.5	Her adversaries have become the head.
LAM.1.5	Her enemies prosper;
LAM.1.5	for the 
LAM.1.5	Her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary.
LAM.1.6	All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion.
LAM.1.6	Her princes have become like deer that find no pasture.
LAM.1.6	They have gone without strength before the pursuer.
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries
LAM.1.7	all her pleasant things that were from the days of old;
LAM.1.7	when her people fell into the hand of the adversary,
LAM.1.7	and no one helped her.
LAM.1.7	The adversaries saw her.
LAM.1.7	They mocked at her desolations.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem has grievously sinned.
LAM.1.8	Therefore she has become unclean.
LAM.1.8	All who honoured her despise her,
LAM.1.8	because they have seen her nakedness.
LAM.1.8	Yes, she sighs, and turns backward.
LAM.1.9	Her filthiness was in her skirts.
LAM.1.9	She didn’t remember her latter end.
LAM.1.9	Therefore she has come down astoundingly.
LAM.1.9	She has no comforter.
LAM.1.9	“See, 
LAM.1.9	for the enemy has magnified himself.”
LAM.1.10	The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things;
LAM.1.10	for she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary,
LAM.1.10	concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly.
LAM.1.11	All her people sigh.
LAM.1.11	They seek bread.
LAM.1.11	They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh their soul.
LAM.1.11	“Look, 
LAM.1.11	for I have become despised.”
LAM.1.12	“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?
LAM.1.12	Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,
LAM.1.12	which is brought on me,
LAM.1.12	with which the 
LAM.1.13	“From on high has he sent fire into my bones,
LAM.1.13	and it prevails against them.
LAM.1.13	He has spread a net for my feet.
LAM.1.13	He has turned me back.
LAM.1.13	He has made me desolate and I faint all day long.
LAM.1.14	“The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand.
LAM.1.14	They are knit together.
LAM.1.14	They have come up on my neck.
LAM.1.14	He made my strength fail.
LAM.1.14	The Lord
LAM.1.14	against whom I am not able to stand.
LAM.1.15	“The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men within me.
LAM.1.15	He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men.
LAM.1.15	The Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a wine press.
LAM.1.16	“For these things I weep.
LAM.1.16	My eye, my eye runs down with water,
LAM.1.16	because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me.
LAM.1.16	My children are desolate,
LAM.1.16	because the enemy has prevailed.”
LAM.1.17	Zion spreads out her hands.
LAM.1.17	There is no one to comfort her.
LAM.1.17	The 
LAM.1.17	that those who are around him should be his adversaries.
LAM.1.17	Jerusalem is amongst them as an unclean thing.
LAM.1.18	“The 
LAM.1.18	for I have rebelled against his commandment.
LAM.1.18	Please hear all you peoples,
LAM.1.18	and see my sorrow.
LAM.1.18	My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.
LAM.1.19	“I called for my lovers,
LAM.1.19	but they deceived me.
LAM.1.19	My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city,
LAM.1.19	while they sought food for themselves to refresh their souls.
LAM.1.20	“Look, 
LAM.1.20	My heart is troubled.
LAM.1.20	My heart turns over within me,
LAM.1.20	for I have grievously rebelled.
LAM.1.20	Abroad, the sword bereaves.
LAM.1.20	At home, it is like death.
LAM.1.21	“They have heard that I sigh.
LAM.1.21	There is no one to comfort me.
LAM.1.21	All my enemies have heard of my trouble.
LAM.1.21	They are glad that you have done it.
LAM.1.21	You will bring the day that you have proclaimed,
LAM.1.21	and they will be like me.
LAM.1.22	“Let all their wickedness come before you.
LAM.1.22	Do to them as you have done to me for all my transgressions.
LAM.1.22	For my sighs are many,
LAM.1.22	and my heart is faint.
LAM.2.1	How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!
LAM.2.1	He has cast the beauty of Israel down from heaven to the earth,
LAM.2.1	and hasn’t remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
LAM.2.2	The Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob
LAM.2.2	without pity.
LAM.2.2	He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah.
LAM.2.2	He has brought them down to the ground.
LAM.2.2	He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.
LAM.2.3	He has cut off all the horn of Israel in fierce anger.
LAM.2.3	He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy.
LAM.2.3	He has burnt up Jacob like a flaming fire,
LAM.2.3	which devours all around.
LAM.2.4	He has bent his bow like an enemy.
LAM.2.4	He has stood with his right hand as an adversary.
LAM.2.4	He has killed all that were pleasant to the eye.
LAM.2.4	In the tent of the daughter of Zion, he has poured out his wrath like fire.
LAM.2.5	The Lord has become as an enemy.
LAM.2.5	He has swallowed up Israel.
LAM.2.5	He has swallowed up all her palaces.
LAM.2.5	He has destroyed his strongholds.
LAM.2.5	He has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.
LAM.2.6	He has violently taken away his tabernacle,
LAM.2.6	as if it were a garden.
LAM.2.6	He has destroyed his place of assembly.
LAM.2.6	The 
LAM.2.6	In the indignation of his anger, he has despised the king and the priest.
LAM.2.7	The Lord has cast off his altar.
LAM.2.7	He has abhorred his sanctuary.
LAM.2.7	He has given the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy.
LAM.2.7	They have made a noise in the 
LAM.2.7	as in the day of a solemn assembly.
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.8	He has stretched out the line.
LAM.2.8	He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying;
LAM.2.8	He has made the rampart and wall lament.
LAM.2.8	They languish together.
LAM.2.9	Her gates have sunk into the ground.
LAM.2.9	He has destroyed and broken her bars.
LAM.2.9	Her king and her princes are amongst the nations where the law is not.
LAM.2.9	Yes, her prophets find no vision from the 
LAM.2.10	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground.
LAM.2.10	They keep silence.
LAM.2.10	They have cast up dust on their heads.
LAM.2.10	They have clothed themselves with sackcloth.
LAM.2.10	The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
LAM.2.11	My eyes fail with tears.
LAM.2.11	My heart is troubled.
LAM.2.11	My liver is poured on the earth,
LAM.2.11	because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,
LAM.2.11	because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	They ask their mothers,
LAM.2.12	“Where is grain and wine?”
LAM.2.12	when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,
LAM.2.12	when their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.
LAM.2.13	What shall I testify to you?
LAM.2.13	What shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem?
LAM.2.13	What shall I compare to you,
LAM.2.13	that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion?
LAM.2.13	For your breach is as big as the sea.
LAM.2.13	Who can heal you?
LAM.2.14	Your prophets have seen false and foolish visions for you.
LAM.2.14	They have not uncovered your iniquity,
LAM.2.14	to reverse your captivity,
LAM.2.14	but have seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment.
LAM.2.15	All that pass by clap their hands at you.
LAM.2.15	They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,
LAM.2.15	“Is this the city that men called ‘The perfection of beauty,
LAM.2.15	the joy of the whole earth’?”
LAM.2.16	All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you.
LAM.2.16	They hiss and gnash their teeth.
LAM.2.16	They say, “We have swallowed her up.
LAM.2.16	Certainly this is the day that we looked for.
LAM.2.16	We have found it.
LAM.2.16	We have seen it.”
LAM.2.17	The 
LAM.2.17	He has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old.
LAM.2.17	He has thrown down,
LAM.2.17	and has not pitied.
LAM.2.17	He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you.
LAM.2.17	He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.
LAM.2.18	Their heart cried to the Lord.
LAM.2.18	O wall of the daughter of Zion,
LAM.2.18	let tears run down like a river day and night.
LAM.2.18	Give yourself no relief.
LAM.2.18	Don’t let your eyes rest.
LAM.2.19	Arise, cry out in the night,
LAM.2.19	at the beginning of the watches!
LAM.2.19	Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord.
LAM.2.19	Lift up your hands towards him for the life of your young children,
LAM.2.19	who faint for hunger at the head of every street.
LAM.2.20	“Look, 
LAM.2.20	Should the women eat their offspring,
LAM.2.20	the children that they held and bounced on their knees?
LAM.2.20	Should the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
LAM.2.21	“The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets.
LAM.2.21	My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword.
LAM.2.21	You have killed them in the day of your anger.
LAM.2.21	You have slaughtered, and not pitied.
LAM.2.22	“You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side.
LAM.2.22	There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of the 
LAM.2.22	My enemy has consumed those whom I have cared for and brought up.
LAM.3.1	I am the man who has seen affliction
LAM.3.1	by the rod of his wrath.
LAM.3.2	He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness,
LAM.3.2	and not in light.
LAM.3.3	Surely he turns his hand against me
LAM.3.3	again and again all day long.
LAM.3.4	He has made my flesh and my skin old.
LAM.3.4	He has broken my bones.
LAM.3.5	He has built against me,
LAM.3.5	and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
LAM.3.6	He has made me dwell in dark places,
LAM.3.6	as those who have been long dead.
LAM.3.7	He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out.
LAM.3.7	He has made my chain heavy.
LAM.3.8	Yes, when I cry, and call for help,
LAM.3.8	he shuts out my prayer.
LAM.3.9	He has walled up my ways with cut stone.
LAM.3.9	He has made my paths crooked.
LAM.3.10	He is to me as a bear lying in wait,
LAM.3.10	as a lion in secret places.
LAM.3.11	He has turned away my ways,
LAM.3.11	and pulled me in pieces.
LAM.3.11	He has made me desolate.
LAM.3.12	He has bent his bow,
LAM.3.12	and set me as a mark for the arrow.
LAM.3.13	He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.
LAM.3.14	I have become a derision to all my people,
LAM.3.14	and their song all day long.
LAM.3.15	He has filled me with bitterness.
LAM.3.15	He has stuffed me with wormwood.
LAM.3.16	He has also broken my teeth with gravel.
LAM.3.16	He has covered me with ashes.
LAM.3.17	You have removed my soul far away from peace.
LAM.3.17	I forgot prosperity.
LAM.3.18	I said, “My strength has perished,
LAM.3.18	along with my expectation from the 
LAM.3.19	Remember my affliction and my misery,
LAM.3.19	the wormwood and the bitterness.
LAM.3.20	My soul still remembers them,
LAM.3.20	and is bowed down within me.
LAM.3.21	This I recall to my mind;
LAM.3.21	therefore I have hope.
LAM.3.22	It is because of The 
LAM.3.22	because his compassion doesn’t fail.
LAM.3.23	They are new every morning.
LAM.3.23	Great is your faithfulness.

LAM.3.26	It is good that a man should hope
LAM.3.26	and quietly wait for the salvation of the 
LAM.3.27	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
LAM.3.28	Let him sit alone and keep silence,
LAM.3.28	because he has laid it on him.
LAM.3.29	Let him put his mouth in the dust,
LAM.3.29	if it is so that there may be hope.
LAM.3.30	Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him.
LAM.3.30	Let him be filled full of reproach.
LAM.3.31	For the Lord will not cast off forever.
LAM.3.32	For though he causes grief,
LAM.3.32	yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
LAM.3.33	For he does not afflict willingly,
LAM.3.33	nor grieve the children of men.
LAM.3.34	To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,
LAM.3.35	to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
LAM.3.36	to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve.
LAM.3.37	Who is he who says, and it comes to pass,
LAM.3.37	when the Lord doesn’t command it?
LAM.3.38	Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?
LAM.3.39	Why does a living man complain,
LAM.3.39	a man for the punishment of his sins?
LAM.3.40	Let us search and try our ways,
LAM.3.40	and turn again to the 
LAM.3.41	Let’s lift up our heart with our hands to God
LAM.3.42	“We have transgressed and have rebelled.
LAM.3.42	You have not pardoned.
LAM.3.43	“You have covered us with anger and pursued us.
LAM.3.43	You have killed.
LAM.3.43	You have not pitied.
LAM.3.44	You have covered yourself with a cloud,
LAM.3.44	so that no prayer can pass through.
LAM.3.45	You have made us an off-scouring and refuse
LAM.3.45	in the middle of the peoples.
LAM.3.46	“All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.
LAM.3.47	Terror and the pit have come on us,
LAM.3.47	devastation and destruction.”
LAM.3.48	My eye runs down with streams of water,
LAM.3.48	for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.3.49	My eye pours down
LAM.3.49	and doesn’t cease,
LAM.3.49	without any intermission,
LAM.3.50	until the 
LAM.3.50	and sees from heaven.
LAM.3.51	My eye affects my soul,
LAM.3.51	because of all the daughters of my city.
LAM.3.52	They have chased me relentlessly like a bird,
LAM.3.52	those who are my enemies without cause.
LAM.3.53	They have cut off my life in the dungeon,
LAM.3.53	and have cast a stone on me.
LAM.3.54	Waters flowed over my head.
LAM.3.54	I said, “I am cut off.”
LAM.3.55	I called on your name, 
LAM.3.55	out of the lowest dungeon.
LAM.3.56	You heard my voice:
LAM.3.56	“Don’t hide your ear from my sighing,
LAM.3.56	and my cry.”
LAM.3.57	You came near in the day that I called on you.
LAM.3.57	You said, “Don’t be afraid.”
LAM.3.58	Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul.
LAM.3.58	You have redeemed my life.
LAM.3.59	, you have seen my wrong.
LAM.3.59	Judge my cause.
LAM.3.60	You have seen all their vengeance
LAM.3.60	and all their plans against me.
LAM.3.61	You have heard their reproach, 
LAM.3.61	and all their plans against me,
LAM.3.62	the lips of those that rose up against me,
LAM.3.62	and their plots against me all day long.
LAM.3.63	You see their sitting down and their rising up.
LAM.3.63	I am their song.
LAM.3.64	You will pay them back, 
LAM.3.64	according to the work of their hands.
LAM.3.65	You will give them hardness of heart,
LAM.3.65	your curse to them.
LAM.3.66	You will pursue them in anger,
LAM.3.66	and destroy them from under the heavens of the 
LAM.4.1	How the gold has become dim!
LAM.4.1	The most pure gold has changed!
LAM.4.1	The stones of the sanctuary are poured out
LAM.4.1	at the head of every street.
LAM.4.2	The precious sons of Zion,
LAM.4.2	comparable to fine gold,
LAM.4.2	how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers,
LAM.4.2	the work of the hands of the potter!
LAM.4.3	Even the jackals offer their breast.
LAM.4.3	They nurse their young ones.
LAM.4.3	But the daughter of my people has become cruel,
LAM.4.3	like the ostriches in the wilderness.
LAM.4.4	The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst.
LAM.4.4	The young children ask bread,
LAM.4.4	and no one breaks it for them.
LAM.4.5	Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets.
LAM.4.5	Those who were brought up in purple embrace dunghills.
LAM.4.6	For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,
LAM.4.6	which was overthrown as in a moment.
LAM.4.6	No hands were laid on her.
LAM.4.7	Her nobles were purer than snow.
LAM.4.7	They were whiter than milk.
LAM.4.7	They were more ruddy in body than rubies.
LAM.4.7	Their polishing was like sapphire.
LAM.4.8	Their appearance is blacker than a coal.
LAM.4.8	They are not known in the streets.
LAM.4.8	Their skin clings to their bones.
LAM.4.8	It is withered.
LAM.4.8	It has become like a stick.
LAM.4.9	Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger;
LAM.4.9	For these pine away, stricken through,
LAM.4.9	for lack of the fruits of the field.
LAM.4.10	The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children.
LAM.4.10	They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.11	He has poured out his fierce anger.
LAM.4.11	He has kindled a fire in Zion,
LAM.4.11	which has devoured its foundations.
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth didn’t believe,
LAM.4.12	neither did all the inhabitants of the world,
LAM.4.12	that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.
LAM.4.13	It is because of the sins of her prophets
LAM.4.13	and the iniquities of her priests,
LAM.4.13	that have shed the blood of the just in the middle of her.
LAM.4.14	They wander as blind men in the streets.
LAM.4.14	They are polluted with blood,
LAM.4.14	So that men can’t touch their garments.
LAM.4.15	“Go away!” they cried to them.
LAM.4.15	“Unclean! Go away! Go away! Don’t touch!
LAM.4.15	When they fled away and wandered, men said amongst the nations,
LAM.4.15	“They can’t live here any more.”
LAM.4.16	The 
LAM.4.16	He will not pay attention to them any more.
LAM.4.16	They didn’t respect the persons of the priests.
LAM.4.16	They didn’t favour the elders.
LAM.4.17	Our eyes still fail,
LAM.4.17	looking in vain for our help.
LAM.4.17	In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.
LAM.4.18	They hunt our steps,
LAM.4.18	so that we can’t go in our streets.
LAM.4.18	Our end is near.
LAM.4.18	Our days are fulfilled,
LAM.4.18	for our end has come.
LAM.4.19	Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky.
LAM.4.19	They chased us on the mountains.
LAM.4.19	They set an ambush for us in the wilderness.
LAM.4.20	The breath of our nostrils,
LAM.4.20	the anointed of the 
LAM.4.20	was taken in their pits;
LAM.4.20	of whom we said,
LAM.4.20	under his shadow we will live amongst the nations.
LAM.4.21	Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom,
LAM.4.21	who dwells in the land of Uz.
LAM.4.21	The cup will pass through to you also.
LAM.4.21	You will be drunken,
LAM.4.21	and will make yourself naked.
LAM.4.22	The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion.
LAM.4.22	He will no more carry you away into captivity.
LAM.4.22	He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom.
LAM.4.22	He will uncover your sins.
LAM.5.1	Remember, 
LAM.5.1	Look, and see our reproach.
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
LAM.5.2	our houses to aliens.
LAM.5.3	We are orphans and fatherless.
LAM.5.3	Our mothers are as widows.
LAM.5.4	We have drunken our water for money.
LAM.5.4	Our wood is sold to us.
LAM.5.5	Our pursuers are on our necks.
LAM.5.5	We are weary, and have no rest.
LAM.5.6	We have given our hands to the Egyptians,
LAM.5.6	and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
LAM.5.7	Our fathers sinned, and are no more.
LAM.5.7	We have borne their iniquities.
LAM.5.8	Servants rule over us.
LAM.5.8	There is no one to deliver us out of their hand.
LAM.5.9	We get our bread at the peril of our lives,
LAM.5.9	because of the sword of the wilderness.
LAM.5.10	Our skin is black like an oven,
LAM.5.10	because of the burning heat of famine.
LAM.5.11	They ravished the women in Zion,
LAM.5.11	the virgins in the cities of Judah.
LAM.5.12	Princes were hanged up by their hands.
LAM.5.12	The faces of elders were not honoured.
LAM.5.13	The young men carry millstones.
LAM.5.13	The children stumbled under loads of wood.
LAM.5.14	The elders have ceased from the gate,
LAM.5.14	and the young men from their music.
LAM.5.15	The joy of our heart has ceased.
LAM.5.15	Our dance is turned into mourning.
LAM.5.16	The crown has fallen from our head.
LAM.5.16	Woe to us, for we have sinned!
LAM.5.17	For this our heart is faint.
LAM.5.17	For these things our eyes are dim:
LAM.5.18	for the mountain of Zion, which is desolate.
LAM.5.18	The foxes walk on it.
LAM.5.19	You, 
LAM.5.19	Your throne is from generation to generation.
LAM.5.20	Why do you forget us forever,
LAM.5.20	and forsake us for so long a time?
LAM.5.21	Turn us to yourself, 
LAM.5.21	Renew our days as of old.
LAM.5.22	But you have utterly rejected us.
LAM.5.22	You are very angry against us.
EZK.1.1	Now in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was amongst the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
EZK.1.2	In the fifth of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity, 
EZK.1.3	the 
EZK.1.4	I looked, and behold,
EZK.1.5	Out of its centre came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man. 
EZK.1.6	Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their feet were straight feet. The sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze. 
EZK.1.8	They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. The four of them had their faces and their wings like this: 
EZK.1.9	Their wings were joined to one another. They didn’t turn when they went. Each one went straight forward.
EZK.1.10	As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. The four of them had the face of a lion on the right side. The four of them had the face of an ox on the left side. The four of them also had the face of an eagle. 
EZK.1.11	Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and two covered their bodies. 
EZK.1.12	Each one went straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went. They didn’t turn when they went. 
EZK.1.13	As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. The fire went up and down amongst the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning went out of the fire. 
EZK.1.14	The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
EZK.1.15	Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it. 
EZK.1.16	The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. The four of them had one likeness. Their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. 
EZK.1.17	When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn when they went. 
EZK.1.18	As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around.
EZK.1.19	When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. When the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 
EZK.1.20	Wherever the spirit was to go, they went. The spirit was to go there. The wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 
EZK.1.21	When those went, these went. When those stood, these stood. When those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
EZK.1.22	Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like an awesome crystal to look at, stretched out over their heads above. 
EZK.1.23	Under the expanse, their wings were straight, one towards the other. Each one had two which covered on this side, and each one had two which covered their bodies on that side. 
EZK.1.24	When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army. When they stood, they let down their wings.
EZK.1.25	There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings. 
EZK.1.26	Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire
EZK.1.27	I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of his waist and upward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. 
EZK.1.28	As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.
EZK.1.28	This was the appearance of the likeness of the 
EZK.2.1	He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.” 
EZK.2.2	The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.
EZK.2.3	He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day. 
EZK.2.4	The children are impudent and stiff-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord
EZK.2.5	They, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse, for they are a rebellious house, yet they will know that there has been a prophet amongst them. 
EZK.2.6	You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you dwell amongst scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.2.7	You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse; for they are most rebellious. 
EZK.2.8	But you, son of man, hear what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.”
EZK.2.9	When I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me; and, behold, a scroll of a book was in it. 
EZK.2.10	He spread it before me. It was written within and without; and lamentations, mourning, and woe were written in it.
EZK.3.1	He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll.
EZK.3.3	He said to me, “Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you.”
EZK.3.3	Then I ate it; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.
EZK.3.4	He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them. 
EZK.3.5	For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel; 
EZK.3.6	not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can’t understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you. 
EZK.3.7	But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to me; for all the house of Israel are obstinate
EZK.3.8	Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads. 
EZK.3.9	I have made your forehead as a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.”
EZK.3.10	Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with your ears all my words that I speak to you. 
EZK.3.11	Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says,’ whether they will hear, or whether they will refuse.”
EZK.3.12	Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, “Blessed be the 
EZK.3.13	I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing. 
EZK.3.14	So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the 
EZK.3.15	Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed amongst them seven days.
EZK.3.16	At the end of seven days, the 
EZK.3.17	“Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me. 
EZK.3.18	When I tell the wicked, ‘You will surely die;’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; that wicked man will die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand. 
EZK.3.19	Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn’t turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.”
EZK.3.20	“Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die. Because you have not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; but I will require his blood at your hand. 
EZK.3.21	Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.”
EZK.3.22	the 
EZK.3.23	Then I arose, and went out into the plain, and behold, the 
EZK.3.24	Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet. He spoke with me, and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house. 
EZK.3.25	But you, son of man, behold, they will put ropes on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out amongst them. 
EZK.3.26	I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you will be mute, and will not be able to correct them; for they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.”
EZK.4.1	“You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before yourself, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem. 
EZK.4.2	Lay siege against it, build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it. Also set camps against it and plant battering rams against it all around. 
EZK.4.3	Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city. Then set your face towards it. It will be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
EZK.4.4	“Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. According to the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity. 
EZK.4.5	For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days. So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
EZK.4.6	“Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have appointed forty days, each day for a year, to you. 
EZK.4.7	You shall set your face towards the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it. 
EZK.4.8	Behold, I put ropes on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege.
EZK.4.9	“Take for yourself also wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel. Make bread of it. According to the number of the days that you will lie on your side, even three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat of it. 
EZK.4.10	Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels
EZK.4.11	You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin.
EZK.4.12	You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.” 
EZK.4.13	The 
EZK.4.14	Then I said, “Ah Lord GOD! Behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals. No abominable meat has come into my mouth!”
EZK.4.15	Then he said to me, “Behold, I have given you cow’s dung for man’s dung, and you shall prepare your bread on it.”
EZK.4.16	Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They will eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness. They will drink water by measure, and in dismay; 
EZK.4.17	that they may lack bread and water, be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.
EZK.5.1	“You, son of man, take a sharp sword. You shall take it as a barber’s razor to yourself, and shall cause it to pass over your head and over your beard. Then take balances to weigh and divide the hair. 
EZK.5.2	A third part you shall burn in the fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled. You shall take a third part, and strike with the sword around it. A third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them. 
EZK.5.3	You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in the folds of your robe. 
EZK.5.4	Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From it a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.
EZK.5.5	“The Lord GOD says: ‘This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, and countries are around her. 
EZK.5.6	She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.’
EZK.5.7	“Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are around you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have followed the ordinances of the nations that are around you; 
EZK.5.8	therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgements amongst you in the sight of the nations. 
EZK.5.9	I will do in you that which I have not done, and which I will not do anything like it any more, because of all your abominations. 
EZK.5.10	Therefore the fathers will eat the sons within you, and the sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgements on you; and I will scatter the whole remnant of you to all the winds. 
EZK.5.11	Therefore as I live,’ says the Lord GOD, ‘surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you. My eye won’t spare, and I will have no pity. 
EZK.5.12	A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and they will be consumed with famine within you. A third part will fall by the sword around you. A third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.
EZK.5.13	“‘Thus my anger will be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath towards them to rest, and I will be comforted. They will know that I, the 
EZK.5.14	“‘Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach amongst the nations that are around you, in the sight of all that pass by. 
EZK.5.15	So it will be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are around you, when I execute judgements on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes—I, the 
EZK.5.16	when I send on them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread. 
EZK.5.17	I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood will pass through you. I will bring the sword on you. I, the 
EZK.6.1	The 
EZK.6.2	“Son of man, set your face towards the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them, 
EZK.6.3	and say, ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! The Lord GOD says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: “Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places. 
EZK.6.4	Your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be broken. I will cast down your slain men before your idols. 
EZK.6.5	I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars. 
EZK.6.6	In all your dwelling places, the cities will be laid waste and the high places will be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. 
EZK.6.7	The slain will fall amongst you, and you will know that I am the 
EZK.6.8	“‘“Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you will have some that escape the sword amongst the nations, when you are scattered through the countries. 
EZK.6.9	Those of you that escape will remember me amongst the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols. Then they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. 
EZK.6.10	They will know that I am the 
EZK.6.11	“The Lord GOD says: ‘Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas!” Because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they will fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. 
EZK.6.12	He who is far off will die of the pestilence. He who is near will fall by the sword. He who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath on them. 
EZK.6.13	You will know that I am the 
EZK.6.14	I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness towards Diblah, throughout all their habitations. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.7.1	Moreover the 
EZK.7.2	“You, son of man, the Lord GOD says to the land of Israel, ‘An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land. 
EZK.7.3	Now the end is on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations. 
EZK.7.4	My eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations will be amongst you. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.7.5	“The Lord GOD says: ‘An evil! A unique evil! Behold, it comes. 
EZK.7.6	An end has come. The end has come! It awakes against you. Behold, it comes. 
EZK.7.7	Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land! The time has come! The day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, on the mountains. 
EZK.7.8	Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all your abominations. 
EZK.7.9	My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways. Your abominations will be amongst you. Then you will know that I, the 
EZK.7.10	“‘Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed. Pride has budded. 
EZK.7.11	Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them will remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. There will be nothing of value amongst them. 
EZK.7.12	The time has come! The day draws near. Don’t let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all its multitude. 
EZK.7.13	For the seller won’t return to that which is sold, although they are still alive; for the vision concerns the whole multitude of it. None will return. None will strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. 
EZK.7.14	They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but no one goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all its multitude.
EZK.7.15	“‘The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within. He who is in the field will die by the sword. He who is in the city will be devoured by famine and pestilence. 
EZK.7.16	But those of those who escape, they will escape and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, everyone in his iniquity. 
EZK.7.17	All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water. 
EZK.7.18	They will also clothe themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them. Shame will be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads. 
EZK.7.19	They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold won’t be able to deliver them in the day of the 
EZK.7.20	As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein. Therefore I have made it to them as an unclean thing. 
EZK.7.21	I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a plunder; and they will profane it. 
EZK.7.22	I will also turn my face from them, and they will profane my secret place. Robbers will enter into it, and profane it.
EZK.7.23	“‘Make chains; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. 
EZK.7.24	Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will also make the pride of the strong to cease. Their holy places will be profaned. 
EZK.7.25	Destruction comes! They will seek peace, and there will be none. 
EZK.7.26	Mischief will come on mischief, and rumour will be on rumour. They will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders. 
EZK.7.27	The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation. The hands of the people of the land will be troubled. I will do to them after their way, and according to their own judgements I will judge them. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.8.1	In the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, the Lord GOD’s hand fell on me there. 
EZK.8.2	Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his waist and downward, fire; and from his waist and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal. 
EZK.8.3	He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks towards the north; where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy. 
EZK.8.4	Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.
EZK.8.5	Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way towards the north.”
EZK.8.5	So I lifted up my eyes the way towards the north, and saw, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
EZK.8.6	He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they do? Even the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you will again see yet other great abominations.”
EZK.8.7	He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	Then he said to me, “Son of man, dig now in the wall.”
EZK.8.8	When I had dug in the wall, I saw a door.
EZK.8.9	He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.”
EZK.8.10	So I went in and looked, and saw every form of creeping things, abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around on the wall. 
EZK.8.11	Seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel stood before them. In the middle of them Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan stood, every man with his censer in his hand; and the smell of the cloud of incense went up.
EZK.8.12	Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his rooms of imagery? For they say, ‘The 
EZK.8.13	He said also to me, “You will again see more of the great abominations which they do.”
EZK.8.14	Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the 
EZK.8.15	Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will again see yet greater abominations than these.”
EZK.8.16	He brought me into the inner court of the 
EZK.8.17	Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger. Behold, they put the branch to their nose. 
EZK.8.18	Therefore I will also deal in wrath. My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.”
EZK.9.1	Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, each man with his destroying weapon in his hand.” 
EZK.9.2	Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies towards the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand. One man in the middle of them was clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stood beside the bronze altar.
EZK.9.3	The glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side. 
EZK.9.4	The 
EZK.9.5	To the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city after him, and strike. Don’t let your eye spare, neither have pity. 
EZK.9.6	Kill utterly the old man, the young man, the virgin, little children and women; but don’t come near any man on whom is the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.”
EZK.9.6	Then they began at the old men who were before the house.
EZK.9.7	He said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!”
EZK.9.7	They went out, and struck in the city. 
EZK.9.8	While they were killing, and I was left, I fell on my face, and cried, and said, “Ah Lord GOD! Will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?”
EZK.9.9	Then he said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perversion; for they say, ‘The 
EZK.9.10	As for me also, my eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.”
EZK.9.11	Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, “I have done as you have commanded me.”
EZK.10.1	Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire
EZK.10.2	He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.”
EZK.10.2	He went in as I watched. 
EZK.10.3	Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. 
EZK.10.4	The 
EZK.10.5	The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
EZK.10.6	It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” that he went in, and stood beside a wheel. 
EZK.10.7	The cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out. 
EZK.10.8	The form of a man’s hand appeared here in the cherubim under their wings.
EZK.10.9	I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub. The appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone. 
EZK.10.10	As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel within a wheel. 
EZK.10.11	When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it. They didn’t turn as they went. 
EZK.10.12	Their whole body, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even the wheels that the four of them had. 
EZK.10.13	As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “the whirling wheels”. 
EZK.10.14	Every one them had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub. The second face was the face of a man. The third face was the face of a lion. The fourth was the face of an eagle.
EZK.10.15	The cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar. 
EZK.10.16	When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also didn’t turn from beside them. 
EZK.10.17	When they stood, these stood. When they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
EZK.10.18	The 
EZK.10.19	The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out, with the wheels beside them. Then they stood at the door of the east gate of the 
EZK.10.20	This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim. 
EZK.10.21	Every one had four faces, and every one four wings. The likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. 
EZK.10.22	As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They each went straight forward.
EZK.11.1	Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of the 
EZK.11.2	He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city; 
EZK.11.3	who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses. This is the cauldron, and we are the meat.’ 
EZK.11.4	Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.”
EZK.11.5	The 
EZK.11.6	You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.”
EZK.11.7	“‘Therefore the Lord GOD says: “Your slain whom you have laid in the middle of it, they are the meat, and this is the cauldron; but you will be brought out of the middle of it. 
EZK.11.8	You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you,” says the Lord GOD. 
EZK.11.9	“I will bring you out of the middle of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgements amongst you. 
EZK.11.10	You will fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.11.11	This will not be your cauldron, neither will you be the meat in the middle of it. I will judge you in the border of Israel. 
EZK.11.12	You will know that I am the 
EZK.11.13	When I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah Lord GOD! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?”
EZK.11.14	The 
EZK.11.15	“Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your relatives, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far away from the 
EZK.11.16	“Therefore say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Whereas I have removed them far off amongst the nations, and whereas I have scattered them amongst the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come.”’
EZK.11.17	“Therefore say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.”
EZK.11.18	“‘They will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there. 
EZK.11.19	I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; 
EZK.11.20	that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way on their own heads,’ says the Lord GOD.”
EZK.11.22	Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them. The glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 
EZK.11.23	The 
EZK.11.24	The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the captives.
EZK.11.24	So the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
EZK.11.25	Then I spoke to the captives all the things that the 
EZK.12.1	The 
EZK.12.2	“Son of man, you dwell in the middle of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and don’t see, who have ears to hear, and don’t hear; for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.12.3	“Therefore, you son of man, prepare your stuff for moving, and move by day in their sight. You shall move from your place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.12.4	You shall bring out your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving. You shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as when men go out into exile. 
EZK.12.5	Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your stuff out that way. 
EZK.12.6	In their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder, and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face, so that you don’t see the land, for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.”
EZK.12.7	I did so as I was commanded. I brought out my stuff by day, as stuff for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought it out in the dark, and bore it on my shoulder in their sight.
EZK.12.8	In the morning, the 
EZK.12.9	“Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’
EZK.12.10	“Say to them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel amongst whom they are.”’
EZK.12.11	“Say, ‘I am your sign. As I have done, so will it be done to them. They will go into exile, into captivity.
EZK.12.12	“‘The prince who is amongst them will bear on his shoulder in the dark, and will go out. They will dig through the wall to carry things out that way. He will cover his face, because he will not see the land with his eyes. 
EZK.12.13	I will also spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there. 
EZK.12.14	I will scatter towards every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his bands. I will draw out the sword after them.
EZK.12.15	“‘They will know that I am the 
EZK.12.16	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations amongst the nations where they come. Then they will know that I am the

EZK.12.18	“Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness. 
EZK.12.19	Tell the people of the land, ‘The Lord GOD says concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: “They will eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and all that is therein, because of the violence of all those who dwell therein.

EZK.12.21	The 
EZK.12.22	“Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?’ 
EZK.12.23	Tell them therefore, ‘The Lord GOD says: “I will make this proverb to cease, and they will no more use it as a proverb in Israel;”’ but tell them, ‘“The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision. 
EZK.12.24	For there will be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. 
EZK.12.25	For I am the

EZK.12.27	“Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off.’
EZK.12.28	“Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “None of my words will be deferred any more, but the word which I speak will be performed,” says the Lord GOD.’”
EZK.13.1	The 
EZK.13.2	“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, ‘Hear the

Then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.”
EZK.13.10	“‘Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, “Peace;” and there is no peace. When one builds up a wall, behold, they plaster it with whitewash. 
EZK.13.11	Tell those who plaster it with whitewash that it will fall. There will be an overflowing shower; and you, great hailstones, will fall. A stormy wind will tear it. 
EZK.13.12	Behold, when the wall has fallen, won’t it be said to you, “Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it?”
EZK.13.13	“‘Therefore the Lord GOD says: “I will even tear it with a stormy wind in my wrath. There will be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it. 
EZK.13.14	So I will break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered. It will fall, and you will be consumed in the middle of it. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.13.15	Thus I will accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those who have plastered it with whitewash. I will tell you, ‘The wall is no more, neither those who plastered it;

EZK.13.17	You, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them, 
EZK.13.18	and say, “The Lord GOD says: ‘Woe to the women who sew pillows on all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves? 
EZK.13.19	You have profaned me amongst my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should not die, and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.’
EZK.13.20	“Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I am against your pillows, with which you hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms. I will let the souls go, even the souls whom you hunt to make them fly.

EZK.13.22	Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive. 
EZK.13.23	Therefore you shall no more see false visions, nor practise divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.14.1	Then some of the elders of Israel came to me, and sat before me. 
EZK.14.2	The 
EZK.14.3	“Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face. Should I be enquired of at all by them? 
EZK.14.4	Therefore speak to them, and tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I the 
EZK.14.5	that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.”’
EZK.14.6	“Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Return, and turn yourselves from your idols! Turn away your faces from all your abominations.
EZK.14.7	“‘“For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live in Israel, who separates himself from me, and takes his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to enquire for himself of me; I the 
EZK.14.8	I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from amongst my people. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.14.9	“‘“If the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the 
EZK.14.10	They will bear their iniquity. The iniquity of the prophet will be even as the iniquity of him who seeks him; 
EZK.14.11	that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God,” says the Lord GOD.’”
EZK.14.12	The 
EZK.14.13	“Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand on it, and break the staff of its bread, and send famine on it, and cut off from it man and animal; 
EZK.14.14	though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness,” says the Lord GOD.
EZK.14.15	“If I cause evil animals to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it is made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the animals; 
EZK.14.16	though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They only would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.
EZK.14.17	“Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, ‘Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and animal;’ 
EZK.14.18	though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only would be delivered themselves.
EZK.14.19	“Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath on it in blood, to cut off from it man and animal; 
EZK.14.20	though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness.”
EZK.14.21	For the Lord GOD says: “How much more when I send my four severe judgements on Jerusalem, the sword, the famine, the evil animals, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and animal! 
EZK.14.22	Yet, behold, there will be left a remnant in it that will be carried out, both sons and daughters. Behold, they will come out to you, and you will see their way and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it. 
EZK.14.23	They will comfort you, when you see their way and their doings; then you will know that I have not done all that I have done in it without cause,” says the Lord GOD.
EZK.15.1	The 
EZK.15.2	“Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is amongst the trees of the forest? 
EZK.15.3	Will wood be taken of it to make anything? Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it? 
EZK.15.4	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and the middle of it is burnt. Is it profitable for any work? 
EZK.15.5	Behold, when it was whole, it was suitable for no work. How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it has been burnt, will it yet be suitable for any work?”
EZK.15.6	Therefore the Lord GOD says: “As the vine tree amongst the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
EZK.15.7	I will set my face against them. They will go out from the fire, but the fire will devour them. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.15.8	I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass,” says the Lord GOD.
EZK.16.1	Again the 
EZK.16.2	“Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations; 
EZK.16.3	and say, ‘The Lord GOD says to Jerusalem: “Your origin and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite. An Amorite was your father, and your mother was a Hittite. 
EZK.16.4	As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut. You weren’t washed in water to cleanse you. You weren’t salted at all, nor wrapped in blankets at all. 
EZK.16.5	No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field, because you were abhorred in the day that you were born.
EZK.16.6	“‘“When I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ Yes, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ 
EZK.16.7	I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you increased and grew great, and you attained to excellent ornament. Your breasts were formed, and your hair grew; yet you were naked and bare.
EZK.16.8	“‘“Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore to you, and entered into a covenant with you,” says the Lord GOD, “and you became mine.
EZK.16.9	“‘“Then I washed you with water. Yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil. 
EZK.16.10	I clothed you also with embroidered work, and put sealskin sandals on you. I dressed you with fine linen and covered you with silk. 
EZK.16.11	I decked you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands, and put a chain on your neck. 
EZK.16.12	I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head. 
EZK.16.13	Thus you were decked with gold and silver. Your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered work. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and you prospered to royal estate. 
EZK.16.14	Your renown went out amongst the nations for your beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put on you,” says the Lord GOD.
EZK.16.15	“‘“But you trusted in your beauty, and played the prostitute because of your renown, and poured out your prostitution on everyone who passed by. It was his. 
EZK.16.16	You took some of your garments, and made for yourselves high places decked with various colours, and played the prostitute on them. This shall not happen, neither shall it be. 
EZK.16.17	You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and played the prostitute with them. 
EZK.16.18	You took your embroidered garments, covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them. 
EZK.16.19	My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you even set it before them for a pleasant aroma; and so it was,” says the Lord GOD.
EZK.16.20	“‘“Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured. Was your prostitution a small matter, 
EZK.16.21	that you have slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire to them? 
EZK.16.22	In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were wallowing in your blood.
EZK.16.23	“‘“It has happened after all your wickedness—woe, woe to you!” says the Lord GOD— 
EZK.16.24	“that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place, and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street. 
EZK.16.25	You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty an abomination, and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution. 
EZK.16.26	You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians, your neighbours, great of flesh; and have multiplied your prostitution, to provoke me to anger. 
EZK.16.27	See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your portion, and delivered you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way. 
EZK.16.28	You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitute with them, and yet you weren’t satisfied. 
EZK.16.29	You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants, to Chaldea; and yet you weren’t satisfied with this.
EZK.16.30	“‘“How weak is your heart,” says the Lord GOD, “since you do all these things, the work of an impudent prostitute; 
EZK.16.31	in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have not been as a prostitute, in that you scorn pay.
EZK.16.32	“‘“A wife who commits adultery! Who takes strangers instead of her husband! 
EZK.16.33	People give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution. 
EZK.16.34	You are different from other women in your prostitution, in that no one follows you to play the prostitute; and whereas you give hire, and no hire is given to you, therefore you are different.”’
EZK.16.35	“Therefore, prostitute, hear the 
EZK.16.36	‘The Lord GOD says, “Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations, and for the blood of your children, that you gave to them; 
EZK.16.37	therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those whom you have loved, with all those whom you have hated. I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness. 
EZK.16.38	I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy. 
EZK.16.39	I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places. They will strip you of your clothes, and take your beautiful jewels. They will leave you naked and bare. 
EZK.16.40	They will also bring up a company against you, and they will stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords. 
EZK.16.41	They will burn your houses with fire, and execute judgements on you in the sight of many women. I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute, and you will also give no hire any more. 
EZK.16.42	So I will cause my wrath towards you to rest, and my jealousy will depart from you. I will be quiet, and will not be angry any more.
EZK.16.43	“‘“Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring your way on your head,” says the Lord GOD: “and you shall not commit this lewdness with all your abominations.
EZK.16.44	“‘“Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb against you, saying, ‘As is the mother, so is her daughter.’ 
EZK.16.45	You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite. 
EZK.16.46	Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells at your right hand, is Sodom with her daughters. 
EZK.16.47	Yet you have not walked in their ways, nor done their abominations; but soon you were more corrupt than they in all your ways. 
EZK.16.48	As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.
EZK.16.49	“‘“Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters. She also didn’t strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. 
EZK.16.50	They were arrogant, and committed abomination before me. Therefore I took them away when I saw it. 
EZK.16.51	Samaria hasn’t committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done. 
EZK.16.52	You also bear your own shame yourself, in that you have given judgement for your sisters; through your sins that you have committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than you. Yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.
EZK.16.53	“‘“I will reverse their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives amongst them; 
EZK.16.54	that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them. 
EZK.16.55	Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former estate; and you and your daughters will return to your former estate. 
EZK.16.56	For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride, 
EZK.16.57	before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you all around. 
EZK.16.58	You have borne your lewdness and your abominations,” says the 
EZK.16.59	“‘For the Lord GOD says: “I will also deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant. 
EZK.16.60	Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. 
EZK.16.61	Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your sisters, your elder sisters and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant. 
EZK.16.62	I will establish my covenant with you. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.16.63	that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more, because of your shame, when I have forgiven you all that you have done,” says the Lord GOD.’”
EZK.17.1	The 
EZK.17.2	“Son of man, tell a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel; 
EZK.17.3	and say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “A great eagle with great wings and long feathers, full of feathers, which had various colours, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar. 
EZK.17.4	He cropped off the topmost of its young twigs, and carried it to a land of traffic. He planted it in a city of merchants.
EZK.17.5	“‘“He also took some of the seed of the land, and planted it in fruitful soil. He placed it beside many waters. He set it as a willow tree. 
EZK.17.6	It grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned towards him, and its roots were under him. So it became a vine, produced branches, and shot out sprigs.
EZK.17.7	“‘“There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. Behold, this vine bent its roots towards him, and shot out its branches towards him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it. 
EZK.17.8	It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might produce branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a good vine.”’
EZK.17.9	“Say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Will it prosper? Won’t he pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? It can’t be raised from its roots by a strong arm or many people.

EZK.17.13	He took some of the royal offspring,
EZK.17.14	that the kingdom might be brought low, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand. 
EZK.17.15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the covenant, and still escape?
EZK.17.16	“‘As I live,’ says the Lord GOD, ‘surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the middle of Babylon he will die. 
EZK.17.17	Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company won’t help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons. 
EZK.17.18	For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things. He won’t escape.
EZK.17.19	“Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘As I live, I will surely bring on his own head my oath that he has despised and my covenant that he has broken.

EZK.18.5	and does that which is lawful and right,
EZK.18.6	and has not eaten on the mountains,
EZK.18.6	hasn’t lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel,

EZK.18.11	or who does not do any of those things,

EZK.18.28	Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live. He shall not die. 
EZK.18.29	Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ House of Israel, aren’t my ways fair? Aren’t your ways unfair?
EZK.18.30	“Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways,” says the Lord GOD. “Return, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity will not be your ruin. 
EZK.18.31	Cast away from you all your transgressions, in which you have transgressed; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you die, house of Israel?

EZK.19.6	He became a young lion.
EZK.19.6	He learnt to catch the prey.
EZK.19.6	He devoured men.
EZK.19.7	He knew their palaces,
EZK.19.7	and laid waste their cities.
EZK.19.7	The land was desolate,
EZK.19.7	with its fullness,
EZK.19.7	because of the noise of his roaring.
EZK.19.8	Then the nations attacked him on every side from the provinces.
EZK.19.8	They spread their net over him.
EZK.19.8	He was taken in their pit.
EZK.19.9	They put him in a cage with hooks,
EZK.19.9	and brought him to the king of Babylon.

EZK.19.11	They were seen in their height
EZK.19.11	with the multitude of their branches.
EZK.19.12	But it was plucked up in fury.
EZK.19.12	It was cast down to the ground,
EZK.19.12	and the east wind dried up its fruit.
EZK.19.12	Its strong branches were broken off and withered.
EZK.19.12	The fire consumed them.
EZK.19.13	Now it is planted in the wilderness,

EZK.20.1	In the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, some of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the 
EZK.20.2	The 
EZK.20.3	“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Is it to enquire of me that you have come? As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “I will not be enquired of by you.”’
EZK.20.4	“Will you judge them, son of man? Will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers. 
EZK.20.5	Tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, ‘I am the

EZK.20.7	I said to them, ‘Each of you throw away the abominations of his eyes. Don’t defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the 
EZK.20.8	“‘“But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me. They didn’t all throw away the abominations of their eyes. They also didn’t forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt. 
EZK.20.9	But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, amongst which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them out of the land of Egypt. 
EZK.20.10	So I caused them to go out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. 
EZK.20.11	I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he will live in them. 
EZK.20.12	Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the 
EZK.20.13	“‘“But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They didn’t walk in my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keeps, he shall live in them.

EZK.20.14	But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. 
EZK.20.15	Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; 
EZK.20.16	because they rejected my ordinances, and didn’t walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols. 
EZK.20.17	Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn’t destroy them. I didn’t make a full end of them in the wilderness. 
EZK.20.18	I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Don’t walk in the statutes of your fathers. Don’t observe their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols.

EZK.20.22	Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out. 
EZK.20.23	Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them amongst the nations, and disperse them through the countries; 
EZK.20.24	because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols. 
EZK.20.25	Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they should not live. 
EZK.20.26	I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused all that opens the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the

There they also made their pleasant aroma, and there they poured out their drink offerings. 
EZK.20.29	Then I said to them, ‘What does the high place where you go mean?’ So its name is called Bamah

EZK.22.18	“Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are bronze, tin, iron, and lead in the middle of the furnace. They are the dross of silver. 
EZK.22.19	Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the middle of Jerusalem. 
EZK.22.20	As they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it; so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you. 
EZK.22.21	Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted in the middle of it. 
EZK.22.22	As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so you will be melted in the middle of it; and you will know that I, the

EZK.22.24	“Son of man, tell her, ‘You are a land that is not cleansed, nor rained on in the day of indignation.’ 
EZK.22.25	There is a conspiracy of her prophets within it, like a roaring lion ravening the prey. They have devoured souls. They take treasure and precious things. They have made many widows within it. 
EZK.22.26	Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hidden their eyes from my Sabbaths. So I am profaned amongst them. 
EZK.22.27	Her princes within it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain. 
EZK.22.28	Her prophets have plastered for them with whitewash, seeing false visions, and divining lies to them, saying, ‘The Lord GOD says,’ when the 
EZK.22.29	The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery. Yes, they have troubled the poor and needy, and have oppressed the foreigner wrongfully.
EZK.22.30	“I sought for a man amongst them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I would not destroy it; but I found no one. 
EZK.22.31	Therefore I have poured out my indignation on them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have brought their own way on their heads,” says the Lord GOD.
EZK.23.1	The 
EZK.23.2	“Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother. 
EZK.23.3	They played the prostitute in Egypt. They played the prostitute in their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their youthful nipples were caressed there. 
EZK.23.4	Their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.
EZK.23.5	“Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine. She doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours, 
EZK.23.6	who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. 
EZK.23.7	She gave herself as a prostitute to them, all of them the choicest men of Assyria. She defiled herself with the idols of whoever she lusted after. 
EZK.23.8	She hasn’t left her prostitution since leaving Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her. They caressed her youthful nipples; and they poured out their prostitution on her.
EZK.23.9	“Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted. 
EZK.23.10	These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters; and they killed her with the sword. She became a byword amongst women; for they executed judgements on her.
EZK.23.11	“Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lusting than she, and in her prostitution which was more depraved than the prostitution of her sister. 
EZK.23.12	She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbours, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. 
EZK.23.13	I saw that she was defiled. They both went the same way.
EZK.23.14	“She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with red, 
EZK.23.15	dressed with belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like princes, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth. 
EZK.23.16	As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them into Chaldea. 
EZK.23.17	The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution. She was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them. 
EZK.23.18	So she uncovered her prostitution and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just like my soul was alienated from her sister. 
EZK.23.19	Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt. 
EZK.23.20	She lusted after their lovers, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses. 
EZK.23.21	Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the caressing of your nipples by the Egyptians because of your youthful breasts.
EZK.23.22	“Therefore, Oholibah, the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side: 
EZK.23.23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses. 
EZK.23.24	They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you with buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will commit the judgement to them, and they will judge you according to their judgements. 
EZK.23.25	I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will take away your nose and your ears. Your remnant will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and the rest of you will be devoured by the fire. 
EZK.23.26	They will also strip you of your clothes, and take away your beautiful jewels. 
EZK.23.27	Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and remove your prostitution from the land of Egypt; so that you will not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.’
EZK.23.28	“For the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated. 
EZK.23.29	They will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labour, and will leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your prostitution will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution. 
EZK.23.30	These things will be done to you, because you have played the prostitute after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols. 
EZK.23.31	You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.’
EZK.23.32	“The Lord GOD says:
EZK.23.32	‘You will drink of your sister’s cup,
EZK.23.32	which is deep and large.
EZK.23.32	You will be ridiculed and held in derision.
EZK.23.32	It contains much.
EZK.23.33	You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,
EZK.23.33	with the cup of astonishment and desolation,
EZK.23.33	with the cup of your sister Samaria.
EZK.23.34	You will even drink it and drain it out.
EZK.23.34	You will gnaw the broken pieces of it,
EZK.23.34	and will tear your breasts;
EZK.23.34	for I have spoken it,’ says the Lord GOD.
EZK.23.35	“Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore you also bear your lewdness and your prostitution.’”
EZK.23.36	The 
EZK.23.37	For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols. They have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them to be devoured. 
EZK.23.38	Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths. 
EZK.23.39	For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, they have done this in the middle of my house.
EZK.23.40	“Furthermore you sisters have sent for men who come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came; for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, decorated yourself with ornaments, 
EZK.23.41	and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you set my incense and my oil.
EZK.23.42	“The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. With men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads. 
EZK.23.43	Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, ‘Now they will play the prostitute with her, and she with them.’ 
EZK.23.44	They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women. 
EZK.23.45	Righteous men will judge them with the judgement of adulteresses and with the judgement of women who shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
EZK.23.46	“For the Lord GOD says: ‘I will bring up a mob against them, and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed. 
EZK.23.47	The company will stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords. They will kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
EZK.23.48	“‘Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to be lewd like you. 
EZK.23.49	They will recompense your lewdness on you, and you will bear the sins of your idols. Then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’”
EZK.24.1	Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the 
EZK.24.2	“Son of man, write the name of the day, this same day. The king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day. 
EZK.24.3	Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says,
EZK.24.3	“Put the cauldron on the fire.
EZK.24.3	Put it on,
EZK.24.3	and also pour water into it.
EZK.24.4	Gather its pieces into it,
EZK.24.4	even every good piece:
EZK.24.4	the thigh and the shoulder.
EZK.24.4	Fill it with the choice bones.
EZK.24.5	Take the choice of the flock,
EZK.24.5	and also a pile of wood for the bones under the cauldron.
EZK.24.5	Make it boil well.
EZK.24.5	Yes, let its bones be boiled within it.”
EZK.24.6	“‘Therefore the Lord GOD says:
EZK.24.6	“Woe to the bloody city,
EZK.24.6	to the cauldron whose rust is in it,
EZK.24.6	and whose rust hasn’t gone out of it!
EZK.24.6	Take out of it piece after piece.
EZK.24.6	No lot is fallen on it.
EZK.24.7	“‘“For her blood is in the middle of her.
EZK.24.7	She set it on the bare rock.
EZK.24.7	She didn’t pour it on the ground,
EZK.24.7	to cover it with dust.
EZK.24.8	That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance,
EZK.24.8	I have set her blood on the bare rock,
EZK.24.8	that it should not be covered.”
EZK.24.9	“‘Therefore the Lord GOD says:
EZK.24.9	“Woe to the bloody city!
EZK.24.9	I also will make the pile great.
EZK.24.10	Heap on the wood.
EZK.24.10	Make the fire hot.
EZK.24.10	Boil the meat well.
EZK.24.10	Make the broth thick,
EZK.24.10	and let the bones be burnt.
EZK.24.11	Then set it empty on its coals,
EZK.24.11	that it may be hot,
EZK.24.11	and its bronze may burn,
EZK.24.11	and that its filthiness may be molten in it,
EZK.24.11	that its rust may be consumed.
EZK.24.12	She is weary with toil;
EZK.24.12	yet her great rust,
EZK.24.12	rust by fire, doesn’t leave her.
EZK.24.13	“‘“In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you and you weren’t cleansed, you won’t be cleansed from your filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath towards you to rest.
EZK.24.14	I, the 
EZK.24.15	Also the 
EZK.24.16	“Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down. 
EZK.24.17	Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind your headdress on you, and put your sandals on your feet. Don’t cover your lips, and don’t eat mourner’s bread.”
EZK.24.18	So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at evening my wife died. So I did in the morning as I was commanded.
EZK.24.19	The people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?”
EZK.24.20	Then I said to them, “The 
EZK.24.21	‘Speak to the house of Israel, “The Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword. 
EZK.24.22	You will do as I have done. You won’t cover your lips or eat mourner’s bread. 
EZK.24.23	Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away in your iniquities, and moan one towards another. 
EZK.24.24	Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’”’”
EZK.24.25	“You, son of man, shouldn’t it be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters, 
EZK.24.26	that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears? 
EZK.24.27	In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you will speak, and be no more mute. So you will be a sign to them. Then they will know that I am the

EZK.27.35	and their kings are horribly afraid.
EZK.27.35	They are troubled in their face.
EZK.27.36	The merchants amongst the peoples hiss at you.

EZK.28.1	The

EZK.28.2	yet you are man,
EZK.28.2	and not God,
EZK.28.2	though you set your heart as the heart of God—
EZK.28.3	behold, you are wiser than Daniel;
EZK.28.3	there is no secret that is hidden from you;
EZK.28.4	by your wisdom and by your understanding you have gotten yourself riches,
EZK.28.4	and have gotten gold and silver into your treasuries;
EZK.28.5	by your great wisdom
EZK.28.5	and by your trading you have increased your riches,

EZK.28.7	They will defile your brightness.
EZK.28.8	They will bring you down to the pit.
EZK.28.8	You will die the death of those who are slain

EZK.28.16	By the abundance of your commerce, your insides were filled with violence,

EZK.28.16	Therefore I have cast you as profane out of God’s mountain.
EZK.28.16	I have destroyed you, covering cherub,

EZK.31.3	with beautiful branches,
EZK.31.3	and with a forest-like shade,
EZK.31.3	of high stature;
EZK.31.3	and its top was amongst the thick boughs.
EZK.31.4	The waters nourished it.
EZK.31.4	The deep made it to grow.
EZK.31.4	Its rivers ran all around its plantation;
EZK.31.4	and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.
EZK.31.5	Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field;
EZK.31.5	and its boughs were multiplied.
EZK.31.5	Its branches became long by reason of many waters,
EZK.31.5	when it spread them out.
EZK.31.6	All the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs.
EZK.31.6	Under its branches, all the animals of the field gave birth to their young.
EZK.31.6	All great nations lived under its shadow.
EZK.31.7	Thus it was beautiful in its greatness,
EZK.31.7	in the length of its branches;
EZK.31.7	for its root was by many waters.
EZK.31.8	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it.
EZK.31.8	The cypress trees were not like its boughs.
EZK.31.8	The pine trees were not as its branches;
EZK.31.8	nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.
EZK.31.9	I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches,
EZK.31.9	so that all the trees of Eden,
EZK.31.9	that were in the garden of God, envied it.’
EZK.31.10	“Therefore thus said the Lord GOD: ‘Because you are exalted in stature, and he has set his top amongst the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; 
EZK.31.11	I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations. He will surely deal with him. I have driven him out for his wickedness. 
EZK.31.12	Strangers, the tyrants of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him. His branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land. All the peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow, and have left him. 
EZK.31.13	All the birds of the sky will dwell on his ruin, and all the animals of the field will be on his branches; 
EZK.31.14	to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, and don’t set their top amongst the thick boughs. Their mighty ones don’t stand up on their height, even all who drink water; for they are all delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, amongst the children of men, with those who go down to the pit.’
EZK.31.15	“The Lord GOD says: ‘In the day when he went down to Sheol
EZK.31.16	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol
EZK.31.17	They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, who lived under his shadow in the middle of the nations.
EZK.31.18	“‘To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness amongst the trees of Eden? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth. You will lie in the middle of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword.

EZK.32.5	I will lay your flesh on the mountains,
EZK.32.5	and fill the valleys with your height.
EZK.32.6	I will also water the land in which you swim with your blood,
EZK.32.6	even to the mountains.
EZK.32.6	The watercourses will be full of you.
EZK.32.7	When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens
EZK.32.7	and make its stars dark.
EZK.32.7	I will cover the sun with a cloud,
EZK.32.7	and the moon won’t give its light.
EZK.32.8	I will make all the bright lights of the sky dark over you,
EZK.32.8	and set darkness on your land,” says the Lord GOD.
EZK.32.9	“I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples,
EZK.32.9	when I bring your destruction amongst the nations,
EZK.32.9	into the countries which you have not known.
EZK.32.10	Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you,
EZK.32.10	and their kings will be horribly afraid for you,
EZK.32.10	when I brandish my sword before them.
EZK.32.10	They will tremble at every moment,
EZK.32.10	every man for his own life,
EZK.32.10	in the day of your fall.”
EZK.32.11	For the Lord GOD says:
EZK.32.11	“The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you.
EZK.32.12	I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of the mighty.
EZK.32.12	They are all the ruthless of the nations.
EZK.32.12	They will bring the pride of Egypt to nothing,
EZK.32.12	and all its multitude will be destroyed.
EZK.32.13	I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters.
EZK.32.13	The foot of man won’t trouble them any more,
EZK.32.13	nor will the hoofs of animals trouble them.
EZK.32.14	Then I will make their waters clear,
EZK.32.14	and cause their rivers to run like oil,”
EZK.32.14	says the Lord GOD.
EZK.32.15	“When I make the land of Egypt desolate and waste,
EZK.32.15	a land destitute of that of which it was full,

EZK.32.18	“Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.

EZK.32.25	They have set her a bed amongst the slain with all her multitude.

EZK.32.27	They will not lie with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are on their bones; for they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
EZK.32.28	“But you will be broken amongst the uncircumcised, and will lie with those who are slain by the sword.
EZK.32.29	“There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword. They will lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.
EZK.32.30	“There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain. They are put to shame in the terror which they caused by their might. They lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
EZK.32.31	“Pharaoh will see them, and will be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword,” says the Lord GOD.

EZK.33.2	“Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them, ‘When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the land take a man from amongst them, and set him for their watchman;

EZK.33.4	then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and doesn’t heed the warning, if the sword comes, and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. 
EZK.33.5	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and didn’t take warning. His blood will be on him; whereas if he had heeded the warning, he would have delivered his soul. 
EZK.33.6	But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn’t blow the trumpet, and the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes, and takes any person from amongst them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.’
EZK.33.7	“So you, son of man: I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and give them warnings from me. 
EZK.33.8	When I tell the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you don’t speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at your hand. 
EZK.33.9	Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he doesn’t turn from his way; he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.
EZK.33.10	“You, son of man, tell the house of Israel: ‘You say this, “Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we pine away in them. How then can we live?”’ 
EZK.33.11	Tell them, ‘“As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why will you die, house of Israel?”’
EZK.33.12	“You, son of man, tell the children of your people, ‘The righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him in the day of his disobedience. And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not fall by it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither will he who is righteous be able to live by it in the day that he sins. 
EZK.33.13	When I tell the righteous that he will surely live; if he trusts in his righteousness, and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but he will die in his iniquity that he has committed. 
EZK.33.14	Again, when I say to the wicked, “You will surely die;” if he turns from his sin, and does that which is lawful and right; 
EZK.33.15	if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he will surely live. He will not die. 
EZK.33.16	None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has done that which is lawful and right. He will surely live.
EZK.33.17	“‘Yet the children of your people say, “The way of the Lord is not fair;” but as for them, their way is not fair. 
EZK.33.18	When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he will even die therein. 
EZK.33.19	When the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he will live by it. 
EZK.33.20	Yet you say, “The way of the Lord is not fair.” House of Israel, I will judge every one of you after his ways.’”
EZK.33.21	In the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, “The city has been defeated!” 
EZK.33.22	Now the 
EZK.33.23	The 
EZK.33.24	“Son of man, those who inhabit the waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, ‘Abraham was one, and he inherited the land; but we are many. The land is given us for inheritance.’ 
EZK.33.25	Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood. So should you possess the land? 
EZK.33.26	You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and every one of you defiles his neighbour’s wife. So should you possess the land?”’
EZK.33.27	“You shall tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says: “As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword. I will give whoever is in the open field to the animals to be devoured; and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of the pestilence. 
EZK.33.28	I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment. The pride of her power will cease. The mountains of Israel will be desolate, so that no one will pass through. 
EZK.33.29	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.33.30	“As for you, son of man, the children of your people talk about you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak to one another, everyone to his brother, saying, ‘Please come and hear what the word is that comes out from the 
EZK.33.31	They come to you as the people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but don’t do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain. 
EZK.33.32	Behold, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they don’t do them.
EZK.33.33	“When this comes to pass—behold, it comes—then they will know that a prophet has been amongst them.”
EZK.34.1	The 
EZK.34.2	“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and tell them, even the shepherds, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Shouldn’t the shepherds feed the sheep? 
EZK.34.3	You eat the fat. You clothe yourself with the wool. You kill the fatlings, but you don’t feed the sheep. 
EZK.34.4	You haven’t strengthened the diseased. You haven’t healed that which was sick. You haven’t bound up that which was broken. You haven’t brought back that which was driven away. You haven’t sought that which was lost, but you have ruled over them with force and with rigor. 
EZK.34.5	They were scattered, because there was no shepherd. They became food to all the animals of the field, and were scattered. 
EZK.34.6	My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill. Yes, my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth. There was no one who searched or sought.”
EZK.34.7	“‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the 
EZK.34.8	“As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the animals of the field, because there was no shepherd, and my shepherds didn’t search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and didn’t feed my sheep.” 
EZK.34.9	Therefore, you shepherds, hear the 
EZK.34.10	The Lord GOD says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds. I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep. The shepherds won’t feed themselves any more. I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.”
EZK.34.11	“‘For the Lord GOD says: “Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. 
EZK.34.12	As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is amongst his sheep that are scattered abroad, so I will seek out my sheep. I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. 
EZK.34.13	I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country. 
EZK.34.14	I will feed them with good pasture; and their fold will be on the mountains of the height of Israel. There they will lie down in a good fold. They will feed on fat pasture on the mountains of Israel. 
EZK.34.15	I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down,” says the Lord GOD. 
EZK.34.16	“I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will feed them in justice.”’
EZK.34.17	“As for you, O my flock, the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the male goats. 
EZK.34.18	Does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? And to have drunk of the clear waters, but must you foul the residue with your feet? 
EZK.34.19	As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet.’
EZK.34.20	“Therefore the Lord GOD says to them: ‘Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. 
EZK.34.21	Because you thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, until you have scattered them abroad; 
EZK.34.22	therefore I will save my flock, and they will no more be a prey. I will judge between sheep and sheep. 
EZK.34.23	I will set up one shepherd over them, and he will feed them, even my servant David. He will feed them, and he will be their shepherd. 
EZK.34.24	I, the 
EZK.34.25	“‘I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land. They will dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. 
EZK.34.26	I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing. I will cause the shower to come down in its season. There will be showers of blessing. 
EZK.34.27	The tree of the field will yield its fruit, and the earth will yield its increase, and they will be secure in their land. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.34.28	They will no more be a prey to the nations, neither will the animals of the earth devour them; but they will dwell securely, and no one will make them afraid. 
EZK.34.29	I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they will no more be consumed with famine in the land, and not bear the shame of the nations any more. 
EZK.34.30	They will know that I, the 
EZK.34.31	You my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God,’ says the Lord GOD.”
EZK.35.1	Moreover the 
EZK.35.2	“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 
EZK.35.3	and tell it, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you. I will make you a desolation and an astonishment. 
EZK.35.4	I will lay your cities waste, and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.35.5	“‘“Because you have had a perpetual hostility, and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end; 
EZK.35.6	therefore, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “I will prepare you for blood, and blood will pursue you. Since you have not hated blood, therefore blood will pursue you. 
EZK.35.7	Thus I will make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation. I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns. 
EZK.35.8	I will fill its mountains with its slain. The slain with the sword will fall in your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses. 
EZK.35.9	I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.35.10	“‘“Because you have said, ‘These two nations and these two countries will be mine, and we will possess it;’ whereas the 
EZK.35.11	therefore, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “I will do according to your anger, and according to your envy which you have shown out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known amongst them when I judge you. 
EZK.35.12	You will know that I, the 
EZK.35.13	You have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me. I have heard it.” 
EZK.35.14	The Lord GOD says: “When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. 
EZK.35.15	As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it. Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.36.1	You, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, “You mountains of Israel, hear the 
EZK.36.2	The Lord GOD says: ‘Because the enemy has said against you, “Aha!” and, “The ancient high places are ours in possession!”’ 
EZK.36.3	therefore prophesy, and say, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that you might be a possession to the residue of the nations, and you are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;” 
EZK.36.4	therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: The Lord GOD says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which have become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are all around; 
EZK.36.5	therefore the Lord GOD says: “Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, to cast it out for a prey.”’ 
EZK.36.6	Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and tell the mountains, the hills, the watercourses and the valleys, ‘The Lord GOD says: “Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you have borne the shame of the nations.” 
EZK.36.7	Therefore the Lord GOD says: “I have sworn, ‘Surely the nations that are around you will bear their shame.’
EZK.36.8	“‘“But you, mountains of Israel, you shall shoot out your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come. 
EZK.36.9	For, behold, I am for you, and I will come to you, and you will be tilled and sown. 
EZK.36.10	I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, even all of it. The cities will be inhabited, and the waste places will be built. 
EZK.36.11	I will multiply man and animal on you. They will increase and be fruitful. I will cause you to be inhabited as you were before, and you will do better than at your beginnings. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.36.12	Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance, and you will never again bereave them of their children.”
EZK.36.13	“‘The Lord GOD says: “Because they say to you, ‘You are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver of your nation;’ 
EZK.36.14	therefore you shall devour men no more, and not bereave your nation any more,” says the Lord GOD. 
EZK.36.15	“I won’t let you hear the shame of the nations any more. You won’t bear the reproach of the peoples any more, and you won’t cause your nation to stumble any more,” says the Lord GOD.’”
EZK.36.16	Moreover the 
EZK.36.17	“Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and by their deeds. Their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity. 
EZK.36.18	Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols. 
EZK.36.19	I scattered them amongst the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. I judged them according to their way and according to their deeds. 
EZK.36.20	When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, ‘These are the

EZK.36.26	I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. 
EZK.36.27	I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes. You will keep my ordinances and do them. 
EZK.36.28	You will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. You will be my people, and I will be your God. 
EZK.36.29	I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you. 
EZK.36.30	I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field, that you may receive no more the reproach of famine amongst the nations.

EZK.36.35	They will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The waste, desolate, and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’

EZK.39.17	“You, son of man, the Lord GOD says: ‘Speak to the birds of every sort, and to every animal of the field, “Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat meat and drink blood. 
EZK.39.18	You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan. 
EZK.39.19	You shall eat fat until you are full, and drink blood until you are drunk, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you. 
EZK.39.20	You shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war,” says the Lord GOD.’
EZK.39.21	“I will set my glory amongst the nations. Then all the nations will see my judgement that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them. 
EZK.39.22	So the house of Israel will know that I am the 
EZK.39.23	The nations will know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them; so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword. 
EZK.39.24	I did to them according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions. I hid my face from them.
EZK.39.25	“Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Now I will reverse the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel. I will be jealous for my holy name. 
EZK.39.26	They will bear their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they dwell securely in their land, and no one will make them afraid, 
EZK.39.27	when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations. 
EZK.39.28	They will know that I am the 
EZK.39.29	I won’t hide my face from them any more; for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Israel,’ says the Lord GOD.”
EZK.40.1	In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck, in the same day, the 
EZK.40.2	In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was something like the frame of a city to the south. 
EZK.40.3	He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. 
EZK.40.4	The man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for you have been brought here so that I may show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.”
EZK.40.5	Behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six cubits
EZK.40.6	Then he came to the gate which looks towards the east, and went up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide; and the other threshold, one reed wide. 
EZK.40.7	Every lodge was one reed long and one reed wide. Between the lodges was five cubits. The threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate towards the house was one reed.
EZK.40.8	He measured also the porch of the gate towards the house, one reed. 
EZK.40.9	Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was towards the house.
EZK.40.10	The lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side. The three of them were of one measure. The posts had one measure on this side and on that side. 
EZK.40.11	He measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits; 
EZK.40.12	and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. 
EZK.40.13	He measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, door against door. 
EZK.40.14	He also made posts, sixty cubits; and the court reached to the posts, around the gate. 
EZK.40.15	From the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits. 
EZK.40.16	There were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate all around, and likewise to the arches. Windows were around inward. Palm trees were on each post.
EZK.40.17	Then he brought me into the outer court. Behold, there were rooms and a pavement made for the court all around. Thirty rooms were on the pavement. 
EZK.40.18	The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement. 
EZK.40.19	Then he measured the width from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north.
EZK.40.20	He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court which faces towards the north. 
EZK.40.21	The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side. Its posts and its arches were the same as the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits. 
EZK.40.22	Its windows, its arches, and its palm trees were the same as the measure of the gate which faces towards the east. They went up to it by seven steps. Its arches were before them. 
EZK.40.23	There was a gate to the inner court facing the other gate, on the north and on the east. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate.
EZK.40.24	He led me towards the south; and behold, there was a gate towards the south. He measured its posts and its arches according to these measurements. 
EZK.40.25	There were windows in it and in its arches all around, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits. 
EZK.40.26	There were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them. It had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on its posts. 
EZK.40.27	There was a gate to the inner court towards the south. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate towards the south.
EZK.40.28	Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. He measured the south gate according to these measurements; 
EZK.40.29	with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.30	There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long, and five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.31	Its arches were towards the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts. The ascent to it had eight steps.
EZK.40.32	He brought me into the inner court towards the east. He measured the gate according to these measurements; 
EZK.40.33	with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide. 
EZK.40.34	Its arches were towards the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps.
EZK.40.35	He brought me to the north gate, and he measured it according to these measurements; 
EZK.40.36	its lodges, its posts, and its arches. There were windows in it all around. The length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits. 
EZK.40.37	Its posts were towards the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps.
EZK.40.38	A room with its door was by the posts at the gates. They washed the burnt offering there. 
EZK.40.39	In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, on which to kill the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. 
EZK.40.40	On the one side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate towards the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables. 
EZK.40.41	Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate: eight tables, on which they killed the sacrifices. 
EZK.40.42	There were four tables for the burnt offering, of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high. They laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice on them. 
EZK.40.43	The hooks, a hand width long, were fastened within all around. The meat of the offering was on the tables.
EZK.40.44	Outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate. They faced towards the south. One at the side of the east gate faced towards the north. 
EZK.40.45	He said to me, “This room, which faces towards the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the house. 
EZK.40.46	The room which faces towards the north is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from amongst the sons of Levi come near to the 
EZK.40.47	He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits wide, square. The altar was before the house.
EZK.40.48	Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. The width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. 
EZK.40.49	The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; even by the steps by which they went up to it. There were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
EZK.41.1	He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits wide on the one side, and six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of the tent. 
EZK.41.2	The width of the entrance was ten cubits;
EZK.41.3	Then he went inward and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits. 
EZK.41.4	He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the temple. He said to me, “This is the most holy place.”
EZK.41.5	Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side room, four cubits, all around the house on every side. 
EZK.41.6	The side rooms were in three storeys, one over another, and thirty in order. They entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported, and not penetrate the wall of the house. 
EZK.41.7	The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower at the higher levels. Therefore the width of the house increased upward; and so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level.
EZK.41.8	I saw also that the house had a raised base all around. The foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six great cubits. 
EZK.41.9	The thickness of the wall, which was for the side rooms, on the outside, was five cubits. That which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house. 
EZK.41.10	Between the rooms was a width of twenty cubits around the house on every side. 
EZK.41.11	The doors of the side rooms were towards an open area that was left, one door towards the north, and another door towards the south. The width of the open area was five cubits all around.
EZK.41.12	The building that was before the separate place at the side towards the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.
EZK.41.13	So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long; 
EZK.41.14	also the width of the face of the house, and of the separate place towards the east, one hundred cubits.
EZK.41.15	He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits from the inner temple, and the porches of the court 
EZK.41.16	the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three storeys, opposite the threshold, with wood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered), 
EZK.41.17	to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around inside and outside, by measure. 
EZK.41.18	It was made with cherubim and palm trees. A palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces; 
EZK.41.19	so that there was the face of a man towards the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion towards the palm tree on the other side. It was made like this through all the house all around. 
EZK.41.20	Cherubim and palm trees were made from the ground to above the door. The wall of the temple was like this.
EZK.41.21	As for the temple, the door posts were squared. As for the face of the sanctuary, its appearance was as the appearance of the temple. 
EZK.41.22	The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, “This is the table that is before the 
EZK.41.23	The temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
EZK.41.24	The doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves: two for the one door, and two leaves for the other. 
EZK.41.25	There were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like those made on the walls. There was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside. 
EZK.41.26	There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch. This is how the side rooms of the house and the thresholds were arranged.
EZK.42.1	Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way towards the north. Then he brought me into the room that was opposite the separate place, and which was opposite the building towards the north. 
EZK.42.2	Before the length of one hundred cubits
EZK.42.3	Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third floor. 
EZK.42.4	Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits’ width inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were towards the north. 
EZK.42.5	Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middle, in the building. 
EZK.42.6	For they were in three storeys, and they didn’t have pillars as the pillars of the courts. Therefore the uppermost was set back more than the lowest and the middle from the ground. 
EZK.42.7	The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, towards the outer court before the rooms, its length was fifty cubits. 
EZK.42.8	For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits. Behold, before the temple were one hundred cubits. 
EZK.42.9	From under these rooms was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.
EZK.42.10	In the thickness of the wall of the court towards the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were rooms. 
EZK.42.11	The way before them was like the appearance of the rooms which were towards the north; according to their length so was their width: and all their exits were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. 
EZK.42.12	According to the doors of the rooms that were towards the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall towards the east, as one enters into them.
EZK.42.13	Then he said to me, “The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before the separate place, are the holy rooms, where the priests who are near to the 
EZK.42.14	When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but they shall lay their garments in which they minister there; for they are holy. Then they shall put on other garments, and shall approach that which is for the people.”
EZK.42.15	Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faces towards the east, and measured it all around. 
EZK.42.16	He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around. 
EZK.42.17	He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around. 
EZK.42.18	He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 
EZK.42.19	He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 
EZK.42.20	He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, the length five hundred, and the width five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.
EZK.43.1	Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks towards the east. 
EZK.43.2	Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth was illuminated with his glory. 
EZK.43.3	It was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. 
EZK.43.4	The 
EZK.43.5	The Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the 
EZK.43.6	I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man stood by me. 
EZK.43.7	He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell amongst the children of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places; 
EZK.43.8	in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door post beside my door post. There was a wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed. Therefore I have consumed them in my anger. 
EZK.43.9	Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me. Then I will dwell amongst them forever.
EZK.43.10	“You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern. 
EZK.43.11	If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its exits, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them.
EZK.43.12	“This is the law of the house. On the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
EZK.43.13	“These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit
EZK.43.14	From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the width a cubit. 
EZK.43.15	The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns. 
EZK.43.16	The altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in its four sides. 
EZK.43.17	The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and its bottom shall be a cubit around; and its steps shall look towards the east.”
EZK.43.18	He said to me, “Son of man, the Lord GOD says: ‘These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they make it, to offer burnt offerings on it, and to sprinkle blood on it. 
EZK.43.19	You shall give to the Levitical priests who are of the offspring of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me,’ says the Lord GOD, ‘a young bull for a sin offering. 
EZK.43.20	You shall take of its blood, and put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around. You shall cleanse it and make atonement for it that way. 
EZK.43.21	You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, outside of the sanctuary.
EZK.43.22	“On the second day you shall offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull. 
EZK.43.23	When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without defect, and a ram out of the flock without defect. 
EZK.43.24	You shall bring them near to the 
EZK.43.25	“Seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering. They shall also prepare a young bull, and a ram out of the flock, without defect. 
EZK.43.26	Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it. So shall they consecrate it. 
EZK.43.27	When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings. Then I will accept you,’ says the Lord GOD.”
EZK.44.1	Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks towards the east; and it was shut. 
EZK.44.2	The 
EZK.44.3	As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before the 
EZK.44.4	Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, the 
EZK.44.5	The 
EZK.44.6	You shall tell the rebellious, even the house of Israel, ‘The Lord GOD says: “You house of Israel, let that be enough of all your abominations, 
EZK.44.7	in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add to all your abominations. 
EZK.44.8	You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.” 
EZK.44.9	The Lord GOD says, “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners who are amongst the children of Israel.
EZK.44.10	“‘“But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they will bear their iniquity. 
EZK.44.11	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house. They shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them. 
EZK.44.12	Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have lifted up my hand against them,” says the Lord GOD, “and they will bear their iniquity. 
EZK.44.13	They shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they will bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed. 
EZK.44.14	Yet I will make them performers of the duty of the house, for all its service, and for all that will be done therein.
EZK.44.15	“‘“But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who performed the duty of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, shall come near to me to minister to me. They shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood,” says the Lord GOD. 
EZK.44.16	“They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my instruction.
EZK.44.17	“‘“It will be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments. No wool shall come on them while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. 
EZK.44.18	They shall have linen turbans on their heads, and shall have linen trousers on their waists. They shall not clothe themselves with anything that makes them sweat. 
EZK.44.19	When they go out into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they minister, and lay them in the holy rooms. They shall put on other garments, that they not sanctify the people with their garments.
EZK.44.20	“‘“They shall not shave their heads, or allow their locks to grow long. They shall only cut off the hair of their heads. 
EZK.44.21	None of the priests shall drink wine when they enter into the inner court. 
EZK.44.22	They shall not take for their wives a widow, or her who is put away; but they shall take virgins of the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest. 
EZK.44.23	They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
EZK.44.24	“‘“In a controversy they shall stand to judge. They shall judge it according to my ordinances. They shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts. They shall make my Sabbaths holy.
EZK.44.25	“‘“They shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister who has had no husband, they may defile themselves. 
EZK.44.26	After he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days. 
EZK.44.27	In the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,” says the Lord GOD.
EZK.44.28	“‘They shall have an inheritance. I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel. I am their possession. 
EZK.44.29	They shall eat the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. 
EZK.44.30	The first of all the first fruits of every thing, and every offering of everything, of all your offerings, shall be for the priest. You shall also give to the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on your house. 
EZK.44.31	The priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself, or is torn, whether it is bird or animal.
EZK.45.1	“‘“Moreover, when you divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an offering to the

EZK.45.3	Of this measure you shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand, and a width of ten thousand. In it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy. 
EZK.45.4	It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the 
EZK.45.5	Twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in width, shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, as a possession for themselves, for twenty rooms.
EZK.45.6	“‘“You shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand wide, and twenty-five thousand long, side by side with the offering of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
EZK.45.7	“‘“What is for the prince shall be on the one side and on the other side of the holy offering and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy offering and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border. 
EZK.45.8	In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel. My princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.”
EZK.45.9	“‘The Lord GOD says: “Let it suffice you, princes of Israel: remove violence and plunder, and execute justice and righteousness; dispossessing my people,” says the Lord GOD.

EZK.45.15	and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel—for a meal offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them,” says the Lord GOD. 
EZK.45.16	“All the people of the land shall give to this offering for the prince in Israel. 
EZK.45.17	It shall be the prince’s part to give the burnt offerings, the meal offerings, and the drink offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the Sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He shall prepare the sin offering, the meal offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.”
EZK.45.18	“‘The Lord GOD says: “In the first month, in the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without defect; and you shall cleanse the sanctuary. 
EZK.45.19	The priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it on the door posts of the house, and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court. 
EZK.45.20	So you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who errs, and for him who is simple. So you shall make atonement for the house.
EZK.45.21	“‘“In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten. 
EZK.45.22	On that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.

EZK.46.2	The prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. 
EZK.46.3	The people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before the 
EZK.46.4	The burnt offering that the prince shall offer to the 
EZK.46.5	and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin
EZK.46.6	On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without defect, and six lambs, and a ram. They shall be without defect. 
EZK.46.7	He shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bull, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 
EZK.46.8	When the prince enters, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go out by its way.
EZK.46.9	“‘“But when the people of the land come before the

EZK.46.11	“‘“In the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an ephah
EZK.46.12	When the prince prepares a free will offering, a burnt offering or peace offerings as a free will offering to the

EZK.46.14	You shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah,

EZK.46.16	“‘The Lord GOD says: “If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance. It shall belong to his sons. It is their possession by inheritance. 
EZK.46.17	But if he gives of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons. 
EZK.46.18	Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession. He shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people not each be scattered from his possession.”’”
EZK.46.19	Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms for the priests, which looked towards the north. Behold, there was a place on the back part westward. 
EZK.46.20	He said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the meal offering; that they not bring them out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.”
EZK.46.21	Then he brought me out into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. 
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty cubits
EZK.46.23	There was a wall around in them, around the four, and boiling places were made under the walls all around. 
EZK.46.24	Then he said to me, “These are the boiling houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.”
EZK.47.1	He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters flowed out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the front of the house faced towards the east. The waters came down from underneath, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar. 
EZK.47.2	Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me around by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looks towards the east. Behold, waters ran out on the right side.
EZK.47.3	When the man went out eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits,
EZK.47.4	Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the waist. 
EZK.47.5	Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters had risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be walked through.
EZK.47.6	He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen?”
EZK.47.6	Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river. 
EZK.47.7	Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. 
EZK.47.8	Then he said to me, “These waters flow out towards the eastern region, and will go down into the Arabah. Then they will go towards the sea; and flow into the sea which will be made to flow out; and the waters will be healed. 
EZK.47.9	It will happen, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, will live. Then there will be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters have come there, and the waters of the sea will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river comes. 
EZK.47.10	It will happen, that fishermen will stand by it. From En Gedi even to En Eglaim will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish will be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many. 
EZK.47.11	But the miry places of it, and its marshes, will not be healed. They will be given up to salt. 
EZK.47.12	By the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, will grow every tree for food, whose leaf won’t wither, neither will its fruit fail. It will produce new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary. Its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for healing.”
EZK.47.13	The Lord GOD says: “This shall be the border, by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions. 
EZK.47.14	You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore to give it to your fathers. This land will fall to you for inheritance.
EZK.47.15	“This shall be the border of the land:
EZK.47.15	“On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad; 
EZK.47.16	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer Hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran. 
EZK.47.17	The border from the sea, shall be Hazar Enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.
EZK.47.18	“The east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border to the east sea you shall measure. This is the east side.
EZK.47.19	“The south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh, to the brook, to the great sea. This is the south side southward.
EZK.47.20	“The west side shall be the great sea, from the south border as far as opposite the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.
EZK.47.21	“So you shall divide this land to yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	It will happen, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you and to the aliens who live amongst you, who will father children amongst you. Then they shall be to you as the native-born amongst the children of Israel. They shall have inheritance with you amongst the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.23	It shall happen, that in whatever tribe the stranger lives, there you shall give him his inheritance,” says the Lord GOD.
EZK.48.1	“Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar Enan at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath (and they shall have their sides east and west), Dan, one portion.

EZK.48.12	It shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land, a most holy thing, by the border of the Levites.
EZK.48.13	“Answerable to the border of the priests, the Levites shall have twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in width. All the length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the width ten thousand. 
EZK.48.14	They shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy to the

EZK.48.16	These shall be its measurements: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. 
EZK.48.17	The city shall have pasture lands: towards the north two hundred and fifty, and towards the south two hundred and fifty, and towards the east two hundred and fifty, and towards the west two hundred and fifty. 
EZK.48.18	The remainder in the length, alongside the holy offering, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward; and it shall be alongside the holy offering. Its increase shall be for food to those who labour in the city. 
EZK.48.19	Those who labour in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it. 
EZK.48.20	All the offering shall be a square of twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand. You shall offer it as a holy offering, with the possession of the city.
EZK.48.21	“The remainder shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy offering and of the possession of the city; in front of the twenty-five thousand of the offering towards the east border, and westward in front of the twenty-five thousand towards the west border, alongside the portions, it shall be for the prince. The holy offering and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the middle of it. 
EZK.48.22	Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the middle of that which is the prince’s, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
EZK.48.23	“As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one portion.

DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 
DAN.1.2	The Lord
DAN.1.3	The king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the children of Israel, even of the royal offspring
DAN.1.4	youths in whom was no defect, but well-favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and endowed with knowledge, and understanding science, and who had the ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the language of the Chaldeans. 
DAN.1.5	The king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at its end they should stand before the king.
DAN.1.6	Now amongst these were of the children of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
DAN.1.7	The prince of the eunuchs gave names to them: to Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.
DAN.1.8	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s dainties, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 
DAN.1.9	Now God made Daniel find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs. 
DAN.1.10	The prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths who are of your own age? Then you would endanger my head with the king.”
DAN.1.11	Then Daniel said to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 
DAN.1.12	“Test your servants, I beg you, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then let our faces be examined before you, and the face of the youths who eat of the king’s dainties; and as you see, deal with your servants.” 
DAN.1.14	So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days.
DAN.1.15	At the end of ten days, their faces appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths who ate of the king’s dainties. 
DAN.1.16	So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they were given to drink, and gave them vegetables.
DAN.1.17	Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
DAN.1.18	At the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	The king talked with them; and amongst them all was found no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore stood they before the king. 
DAN.1.20	In every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm.
DAN.1.21	Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamt dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him. 
DAN.2.2	Then the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be called to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. 
DAN.2.3	The king said to them, “I have dreamt a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.”
DAN.2.4	Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”
DAN.2.5	The king answered the Chaldeans, “The thing has gone from me. If you don’t make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be cut in pieces, and your houses will be made a dunghill. 
DAN.2.6	But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honour. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.”
DAN.2.7	They answered the second time and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”
DAN.2.8	The king answered, “I know of a certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see the thing has gone from me. 
DAN.2.9	But if you don’t make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the situation changes. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can show me its interpretation.”
DAN.2.10	The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, “There is not a man on the earth who can show the king’s matter, because no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or Chaldean. 
DAN.2.11	It is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”
DAN.2.12	Because of this, the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed. 
DAN.2.13	So the decree went out, and the wise men were to be slain. They sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.15	He answered Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree so urgent from the king?” Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. 
DAN.2.16	Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 
DAN.2.18	that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.19	Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
DAN.2.20	Daniel answered,
DAN.2.20	“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever;
DAN.2.20	for wisdom and might are his.
DAN.2.21	He changes the times and the seasons.
DAN.2.21	He removes kings and sets up kings.
DAN.2.21	He gives wisdom to the wise,
DAN.2.21	and knowledge to those who have understanding.
DAN.2.22	He reveals the deep and secret things.
DAN.2.22	He knows what is in the darkness,
DAN.2.22	and the light dwells with him.
DAN.2.23	I thank you and praise you,
DAN.2.23	O God of my fathers,
DAN.2.23	who have given me wisdom and might,
DAN.2.23	and have now made known to me what we desired of you;
DAN.2.23	for you have made known to us the king’s matter.”
DAN.2.24	Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said this to him: “Don’t destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.”
DAN.2.25	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said this to him: “I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah who will make known to the king the interpretation.”
DAN.2.26	The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?”
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered before the king, and said, “The secret which the king has demanded can’t be shown to the king by wise men, enchanters, magicians, or soothsayers; 
DAN.2.28	but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:
DAN.2.29	“As for you, O king, your thoughts came on your bed, what should happen hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what will happen. 
DAN.2.30	But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.
DAN.2.31	“You, O king, saw, and behold,
DAN.2.32	As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, 
DAN.2.33	its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay. 
DAN.2.34	You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. 
DAN.2.35	Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them. The stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	“This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king. 
DAN.2.37	You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory. 
DAN.2.38	Wherever the children of men dwell, he has given the animals of the field and the birds of the sky into your hand, and has made you rule over them all. You are the head of gold.
DAN.2.39	“After you, another kingdom will arise that is inferior to you; and another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth. 
DAN.2.40	The fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, it will break in pieces and crush. 
DAN.2.41	Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay. 
DAN.2.42	As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong, and partly broken. 
DAN.2.43	Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they will mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they won’t cling to one another, even as iron does not mix with clay.
DAN.2.44	“In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, nor will its sovereignty be left to another people; but it will break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever. 
DAN.2.45	Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what will happen hereafter. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.”
DAN.2.46	Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odours to him. 
DAN.2.47	The king answered to Daniel, and said, “Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealler of secrets, since you have been able to reveal this secret.”
DAN.2.48	Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.49	Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was in the king’s gate.
DAN.3.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits,
DAN.3.2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 
DAN.3.3	Then the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
DAN.3.4	Then the herald cried aloud, “To you it is commanded, peoples, nations, and languages, 
DAN.3.5	that whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up. 
DAN.3.6	Whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace the same hour.”
DAN.3.7	Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
DAN.3.8	Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews. 
DAN.3.9	They answered Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, live for ever! 
DAN.3.10	You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image; 
DAN.3.11	and whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. 
DAN.3.12	There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have not respected you. They don’t serve your gods, and don’t worship the golden image which you have set up.”
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. Then these men were brought before the king. 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar answered them, “Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don’t serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? 
DAN.3.15	Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, good; but if you don’t worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. Who is that god who will deliver you out of my hands?”
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 
DAN.3.17	If it happens, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. 
DAN.3.18	But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.”
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated. 
DAN.3.20	He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. 
DAN.3.21	Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other clothes, and were cast into the middle of the burning fiery furnace. 
DAN.3.22	Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 
DAN.3.23	These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste. He spoke and said to his counsellors, “Didn’t we cast three men bound into the middle of the fire?”
DAN.3.24	They answered the king, “True, O king.”
DAN.3.25	He answered, “Look, I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are unharmed. The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.”
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace. He spoke and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!”
DAN.3.26	Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire. 
DAN.3.27	The local governors, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies. The hair of their head wasn’t singed. Their pants weren’t changed, the smell of fire wasn’t even on them.
DAN.3.28	Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. 
DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything evil against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.”
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king,
DAN.4.1	to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth:
DAN.4.1	Peace be multiplied to you.
DAN.4.2	It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked towards me.
DAN.4.3	How great are his signs!
DAN.4.3	How mighty are his wonders!
DAN.4.3	His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.
DAN.4.3	His dominion is from generation to generation.
DAN.4.4	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace. 
DAN.4.5	I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 
DAN.4.6	Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. 
DAN.4.7	Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in; and I told the dream before them; but they didn’t make known to me its interpretation. 
DAN.4.8	But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. I told the dream before him, saying,
DAN.4.9	“Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation. 
DAN.4.10	These were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the middle of the earth; and its height was great. 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached to the sky, and its sight to the end of all the earth. 
DAN.4.12	Its leaves were beautiful, and it had much fruit, and in it was food for all. The animals of the field had shade under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.
DAN.4.13	“I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky. 
DAN.4.14	He cried aloud, and said this, ‘Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches! Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit! Let the animals get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches. 
DAN.4.15	Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky. Let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth. 
DAN.4.16	Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let an animal’s heart be given to him. Then let seven times pass over him.
DAN.4.17	“‘The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men.’
DAN.4.18	“This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
DAN.4.19	Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream, or the interpretation, trouble you.”
DAN.4.19	Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries. 
DAN.4.20	The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the sky, and its sight to all the earth; 
DAN.4.21	whose leaves were beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and in it was food for all; under which the animals of the field lived, and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habitation: 
DAN.4.22	it is you, O king, that have grown and become strong; for your greatness has grown, and reaches to the sky, and your dominion to the end of the earth.
DAN.4.23	“Whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the sky, and saying, ‘Cut down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of the sky. Let his portion be with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him.’
DAN.4.24	“This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come on my lord the king: 
DAN.4.25	that you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You shall be made to eat grass as oxen, and shall be wet with the dew of the sky, and seven times shall pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will. 
DAN.4.26	Whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; your kingdom shall be sure to you, after that you will have known that the heavens do rule. 
DAN.4.27	Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps there may be a lengthening of your tranquillity.”
DAN.4.28	All this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.4.29	At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. 
DAN.4.30	The king spoke and said, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?”
DAN.4.31	While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice came from the sky, saying, “O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: ‘The kingdom has departed from you. 
DAN.4.32	You shall be driven from men; and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You shall be made to eat grass as oxen. Seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.’”
DAN.4.33	This was fulfilled the same hour on Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky, until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.
DAN.4.34	At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him who lives forever;
DAN.4.34	for his dominion is an everlasting dominion,
DAN.4.34	and his kingdom from generation to generation.
DAN.4.35	All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing;
DAN.4.35	and he does according to his will in the army of heaven,
DAN.4.35	and amongst the inhabitants of the earth;
DAN.4.35	and no one can stop his hand,
DAN.4.35	or ask him, “What are you doing?”
DAN.4.36	At the same time my understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me. My counsellors and my lords sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me. 
DAN.4.37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honour the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase.
DAN.5.1	Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. 
DAN.5.2	Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded that the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem be brought to him; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from them. 
DAN.5.3	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God’s house which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them. 
DAN.5.4	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
DAN.5.5	In the same hour, the fingers of a man’s hand came out and wrote near the lamp stand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace. The king saw the part of the hand that wrote. 
DAN.5.6	Then the king’s face was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his thighs were loosened, and his knees struck one against another.
DAN.5.7	The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”
DAN.5.8	Then all the king’s wise men came in; but they could not read the writing, and couldn’t make known to the king the interpretation. 
DAN.5.9	Then king Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his face was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.
DAN.5.10	The queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house. The queen spoke and said, “O king, live forever; don’t let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your face be changed. 
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him. The king, Nebuchadnezzar, your father, yes, the king, your father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; 
DAN.5.12	because an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting of dreams, showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.”
DAN.5.13	Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah? 
DAN.5.14	I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light, understanding, and excellent wisdom are found in you. 
DAN.5.15	Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known to me its interpretation; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing. 
DAN.5.16	But I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations, and dissolve doubts. Now if you can read the writing, and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold around your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered before the king, “Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
DAN.5.18	“To you, king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty. 
DAN.5.19	Because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. He killed whom he wanted to, and he kept alive whom he wanted to. He raised up whom he wanted to, and he put down whom he wanted to. 
DAN.5.20	But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him. 
DAN.5.21	He was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the animals’, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky; until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whomever he will.
DAN.5.22	“You, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this, 
DAN.5.23	but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine from them. You have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which don’t see, or hear, or know; and you have not glorified the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways. 
DAN.5.24	Then the part of the hand was sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.
DAN.5.25	“This is the writing that was inscribed: ‘MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.’
DAN.5.26	“This is the interpretation of the thing:
DAN.5.26	MENE: God has counted your kingdom, and brought it to an end.
DAN.5.27	TEKEL: you are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.
DAN.5.28	PERES: your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.”
DAN.5.29	Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.30	In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain. 
DAN.5.31	Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.
DAN.6.1	It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty local governors, who should be throughout the whole kingdom; 
DAN.6.2	and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these local governors might give account to them, and that the king should suffer no loss. 
DAN.6.3	Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the local governors, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
DAN.6.4	Then the presidents and the local governors sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion or fault, because he was faithful. There wasn’t any error or fault found in him. 
DAN.6.5	Then these men said, “We won’t find any occasion against this Daniel, unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.”
DAN.6.6	Then these presidents and local governors assembled together to the king, and said this to him, “King Darius, live forever! 
DAN.6.7	All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the local governors, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong decree, that whoever asks a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. 
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.” 
DAN.6.9	Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
DAN.6.10	When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his room towards Jerusalem) and he knelt on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before. 
DAN.6.11	Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God. 
DAN.6.12	Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree: “Haven’t you signed a decree that every man who makes a petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?”
DAN.6.12	The king answered, “This thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.”
DAN.6.13	Then they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, doesn’t respect you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.” 
DAN.6.14	Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he laboured until the going down of the sun to rescue him.
DAN.6.15	Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.”
DAN.6.16	Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.”
DAN.6.17	A stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. 
DAN.6.18	Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting. No musical instruments were brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.
DAN.6.19	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions. 
DAN.6.20	When he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?”
DAN.6.21	Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! 
DAN.6.22	My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; because as before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”
DAN.6.23	Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
DAN.6.24	The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions mauled them, and broke all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.
DAN.6.25	Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth:
DAN.6.25	“Peace be multiplied to you.
DAN.6.26	“I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel;
DAN.6.26	“for he is the living God,
DAN.6.26	and steadfast forever.
DAN.6.26	His kingdom is that which will not be destroyed.
DAN.6.26	His dominion will be even to the end.
DAN.6.27	He delivers and rescues.
DAN.6.27	He works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth,
DAN.6.27	who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”
DAN.6.28	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed. Then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.
DAN.7.2	Daniel spoke and said, “I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the sky broke out on the great sea. 
DAN.7.3	Four great animals came up from the sea, different from one another.
DAN.7.4	“The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings. I watched until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man. A man’s heart was given to it.
DAN.7.5	“Behold, there was another animal, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. They said this to it: ‘Arise! Devour much flesh!’
DAN.7.6	“After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The animal also had four heads; and dominion was given to it.
DAN.7.7	“After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there was a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. It was different from all the animals that were before it. It had ten horns.
DAN.7.8	“I considered the horns, and behold, there came up amongst them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
DAN.7.9	“I watched until thrones were placed,
DAN.7.9	and one who was ancient of days sat.
DAN.7.9	His clothing was white as snow,
DAN.7.9	and the hair of his head like pure wool.
DAN.7.9	His throne was fiery flames,
DAN.7.9	and its wheels burning fire.
DAN.7.10	A fiery stream issued and came out from before him.
DAN.7.10	Thousands of thousands ministered to him.
DAN.7.10	Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.
DAN.7.10	The judgement was set.
DAN.7.10	The books were opened.
DAN.7.11	“I watched at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I watched even until the animal was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burnt with fire. 
DAN.7.12	As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
DAN.7.13	“I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. 
DAN.7.14	Dominion was given him, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom one that which will not be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved within my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. 
DAN.7.16	I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this.
DAN.7.16	“So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. 
DAN.7.17	‘These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who will arise out of the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.’
DAN.7.19	“Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; 
DAN.7.20	and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows. 
DAN.7.21	I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them, 
DAN.7.22	until the ancient of days came, and judgement was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	“So he said, ‘The fourth animal will be a fourth kingdom on earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms, and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down, and break it in pieces. 
DAN.7.24	As for the ten horns, ten kings will arise out of this kingdom. Another will arise after them; and he will be different from the former, and he will put down three kings. 
DAN.7.25	He will speak words against the Most High, and will wear out the saints of the Most High. He will plan to change the times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.
DAN.7.26	“‘But the judgement will be set, and they will take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end. 
DAN.7.27	The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole sky, will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey him.’
DAN.7.28	“Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and my face was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.”
DAN.8.1	In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. 
DAN.8.2	I saw the vision. Now it was so, that when I saw, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai. 
DAN.8.3	Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns. The two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward. No animals could stand before him. There wasn’t any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.
DAN.8.5	As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn’t touch the ground. The goat had a notable horn between his eyes. 
DAN.8.6	He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power. 
DAN.8.7	I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him. There was no one who could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
DAN.8.8	The male goat magnified himself exceedingly. When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns towards the four winds of the sky.
DAN.8.9	Out of one of them came out a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, towards the south, and towards the east, and towards the glorious land. 
DAN.8.10	It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and it cast down some of the army and of the stars to the ground, and trampled on them. 
DAN.8.11	Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army; and it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. 
DAN.8.12	The army was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through disobedience. It cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered.
DAN.8.13	Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, “How long will the vision about the continual burnt offering, and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trodden under foot be?”
DAN.8.14	He said to me, “To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary will be cleansed.”
DAN.8.15	When I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. Then behold, there stood before me something like the appearance of a man. 
DAN.8.16	I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”
DAN.8.17	So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end.”
DAN.8.18	Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face towards the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.
DAN.8.19	He said, “Behold, I will make you know what will be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end. 
DAN.8.20	The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. 
DAN.8.21	The rough male goat is the king of Greece. The great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. 
DAN.8.22	As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms will stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.
DAN.8.23	“In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce face, and understanding dark sentences, will stand up. 
DAN.8.24	His power will be mighty, but not by his own power. He will destroy awesomely, and will prosper in what he does. He will destroy the mighty ones and the holy people. 
DAN.8.25	Through his policy he will cause deceit to prosper in his hand. He will magnify himself in his heart, and he will destroy many in their security. He will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be broken without hand.
DAN.8.26	“The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision, for it belongs to many days to come.”
DAN.8.27	I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick for some days. Then I rose up, and did the king’s business. I wondered at the vision, but no one understood it.
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the offspring of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans, 
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years about which the 
DAN.9.3	I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and petitions, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
DAN.9.4	I prayed to the 
DAN.9.4	“Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments, 
DAN.9.5	we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances. 
DAN.9.6	We haven’t listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
DAN.9.7	“Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but to us confusion of face, as it is today; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near, and who are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you. 
DAN.9.8	Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you. 
DAN.9.9	To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him. 
DAN.9.10	We haven’t obeyed the 
DAN.9.11	Yes, all Israel have transgressed your law, turning aside, that they should not obey your voice.
DAN.9.11	“Therefore the curse and the oath written in the law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us; for we have sinned against him. 
DAN.9.12	He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing on us a great evil; for under the whole sky, such has not been done as has been done to Jerusalem. 
DAN.9.13	As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come on us. Yet we have not entreated the favour of the 
DAN.9.14	Therefore the 
DAN.9.15	“Now, Lord our God, who has brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gotten yourself renown, as it is today; we have sinned. We have done wickedly. 
DAN.9.16	Lord, according to all your righteousness, please let your anger and your wrath be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all who are around us.
DAN.9.17	“Now therefore, our God, listen to the prayer of your servant, and to his petitions, and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake. 
DAN.9.18	My God, turn your ear, and hear. Open your eyes, and see our desolations, and the city which is called by your name; for we do not present our petitions before you for our righteousness, but for your great mercies’ sake. 
DAN.9.19	Lord, hear. Lord, forgive. Lord, listen and do. Don’t defer, for your own sake, my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.”
DAN.9.20	While I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the 
DAN.9.21	yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening offering. 
DAN.9.22	He instructed me and talked with me, and said, “Daniel, I have now come to give you wisdom and understanding. 
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of your petitions the commandment went out, and I have come to tell you; for you are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.
DAN.9.24	“Seventy weeks are decreed on your people and on your holy city, to finish disobedience, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.
DAN.9.25	“Know therefore and discern that from the going out of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Anointed One,
DAN.9.26	After the sixty-two weeks the Anointed One
DAN.9.27	He will make a firm covenant with many for one week. In the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. On the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate; and even to the full end, and that determined, wrath will be poured out on the desolate.”
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare. He understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
DAN.10.2	In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I ate no pleasant bread. No meat or wine came into my mouth. I didn’t anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled.
DAN.10.4	In the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel, 
DAN.10.5	I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, there was a man clothed in linen, whose thighs were adorned with pure gold of Uphaz. 
DAN.10.6	His body also was like beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches. His arms and his feet were like burnished bronze. The voice of his words was like the voice of a multitude.
DAN.10.7	I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me didn’t see the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves. 
DAN.10.8	So I was left alone, and saw this great vision. No strength remained in me; for my face grew deathly pale, and I retained no strength. 
DAN.10.9	Yet I heard the voice of his words. When I heard the voice of his words, then I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face towards the ground.
DAN.10.10	Behold, a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands. 
DAN.10.11	He said to me, “Daniel, you greatly beloved man, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright; for I have been sent to you, now.” When he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.
DAN.10.12	Then he said to me, “Don’t be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come for your words’ sake. 
DAN.10.13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but, behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me because I remained there with the kings of Persia. 
DAN.10.14	Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for many days.”
DAN.10.15	When he had spoken these words to me, I set my face towards the ground, and was mute. 
DAN.10.16	Behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood before me, “My lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows have overtaken me, and I retain no strength. 
DAN.10.17	For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? For as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me. There was no breath left in me.”
DAN.10.18	Then one like the appearance of a man touched me again, and he strengthened me. 
DAN.10.19	He said, “Greatly beloved man, don’t be afraid. Peace be to you. Be strong. Yes, be strong.”
DAN.10.19	When he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, “Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me.”
DAN.10.20	Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. When I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come. 
DAN.10.21	But I will tell you that which is inscribed in the writing of truth. There is no one who holds with me against these, but Michael your prince.
DAN.11.1	“As for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
DAN.11.2	“Now I will show you the truth. Behold, three more kings will stand up in Persia; and the fourth will be far richer than all of them. When he has grown strong through his riches, he will stir up all against the realm of Greece. 
DAN.11.3	A mighty king will stand up, who will rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. 
DAN.11.4	When he stands up, his kingdom will be broken, and will be divided towards the four winds of the sky, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be plucked up, even for others besides these.
DAN.11.5	“The king of the south will be strong. One of his princes will become stronger than him, and have dominion. His dominion will be a great dominion. 
DAN.11.6	At the end of years they will join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement; but she will not retain the strength of her arm. He will also not stand, nor will his arm; but she will be given up, with those who brought her, and he who became the father of her, and he who strengthened her in those times.
DAN.11.7	“But out of a shoot from her roots one will stand up in his place, who will come to the army, and will enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and will deal against them, and will prevail. 
DAN.11.8	He will also carry their gods, with their molten images, and with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, captive into Egypt. He will refrain some years from the king of the north. 
DAN.11.9	He will come into the realm of the king of the south, but he will return into his own land. 
DAN.11.10	His sons will wage war, and will assemble a multitude of great forces, which will come on, and overflow, and pass through. They will return and wage war, even to his fortress.
DAN.11.11	“The king of the south will be moved with anger, and will come out and fight with him, even with the king of the north. He will send out a great multitude, and the multitude will be given into his hand. 
DAN.11.12	The multitude will be lifted up, and his heart will be exalted. He will cast down tens of thousands, but he won’t prevail. 
DAN.11.13	The king of the north will return, and will send out a multitude greater than the former. He will come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with much substance.
DAN.11.14	“In those times many will stand up against the king of the south. Also the children of the violent amongst your people will lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they will fall. 
DAN.11.15	So the king of the north will come and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city. The forces of the south won’t stand, neither will his chosen people, neither will there be any strength to stand. 
DAN.11.16	But he who comes against him will do according to his own will, and no one will stand before him. He will stand in the glorious land, and destruction will be in his hand. 
DAN.11.17	He will set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions. He will perform them. He will give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she will not stand, and won’t be for him. 
DAN.11.18	After this he will turn his face to the islands, and will take many; but a prince will cause the reproach offered by him to cease. Yes, moreover, he will cause his reproach to turn on him. 
DAN.11.19	Then he will turn his face towards the fortresses of his own land; but he will stumble and fall, and won’t be found.
DAN.11.20	“Then one who will cause a tax collector to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory will stand up in his place; but within few days he shall be destroyed, not in anger, and not in battle.
DAN.11.21	“In his place a contemptible person will stand up, to whom they had not given the honour of the kingdom; but he will come in time of security, and will obtain the kingdom by flatteries. 
DAN.11.22	The overwhelming forces will be overwhelmed from before him, and will be broken. Yes, also the prince of the covenant. 
DAN.11.23	After the treaty made with him he will work deceitfully; for he will come up, and will become strong, with a small people. 
DAN.11.24	In time of security he will come even on the fattest places of the province. He will do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers. He will scatter amongst them prey, plunder, and substance. Yes, he will devise his plans against the strongholds, even for a time.
DAN.11.25	“He will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will wage war in battle with an exceedingly great and mighty army; but he won’t stand; for they will devise plans against him. 
DAN.11.26	Yes, those who eat of his dainties will destroy him, and his army will be swept away. Many will fall down slain. 
DAN.11.27	As for both these kings, their hearts will be to do mischief, and they will speak lies at one table; but it won’t prosper, for the end will still be at the appointed time. 
DAN.11.28	Then he will return into his land with great wealth. His heart will be against the holy covenant. He will take action, and return to his own land.
DAN.11.29	“He will return at the appointed time, and come into the south; but it won’t be in the latter time as it was in the former. 
DAN.11.30	For ships of Kittim will come against him. Therefore he will be grieved, and will return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and will take action. He will even return, and have regard to those who forsake the holy covenant.
DAN.11.31	“Forces will stand on his part, and they will profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and will take away the continual burnt offering. Then they will set up the abomination that makes desolate. 
DAN.11.32	He will corrupt those who do wickedly against the covenant by flatteries; but the people who know their God will be strong, and take action.
DAN.11.33	“Those who are wise amongst the people will instruct many; yet they will fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder, many days. 
DAN.11.34	Now when they fall, they will be helped with a little help; but many will join themselves to them with flatteries. 
DAN.11.35	Some of those who are wise will fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.
DAN.11.36	“The king will do according to his will. He will exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and will speak marvellous things against the God of gods. He will prosper until the indignation is accomplished; for that which is determined will be done. 
DAN.11.37	He won’t regard the gods of his fathers, or the desire of women, or regard any god; for he will magnify himself above all. 
DAN.11.38	But in his place he will honour the god of fortresses. He will honour a god whom his fathers didn’t know with gold, silver, and with precious stones and pleasant things. 
DAN.11.39	He will deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god. He will increase with glory whoever acknowledges him. He will cause them to rule over many, and will divide the land for a price.
DAN.11.40	“At the time of the end the king of the south will contend with him; and the king of the north will come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, with horsemen, and with many ships. He will enter into the countries, and will overflow and pass through. 
DAN.11.41	He will enter also into the glorious land, and many countries will be overthrown; but these will be delivered out of his hand: Edom, Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. 
DAN.11.42	He will also stretch out his hand on the countries. The land of Egypt won’t escape. 
DAN.11.43	But he will have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt. The Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps. 
DAN.11.44	But news out of the east and out of the north will trouble him; and he will go out with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many. 
DAN.11.45	He will plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
DAN.12.1	“At that time Michael will stand up, the great prince who stands for the children of your people; and there will be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. At that time your people will be delivered, everyone who is found written in the book. 
DAN.12.2	Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. 
DAN.12.3	Those who are wise will shine as the brightness of the expanse. Those who turn many to righteousness will shine as the stars forever and ever. 
DAN.12.4	But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end. Many will run back and forth, and knowledge will be increased.”
DAN.12.5	Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood, one on the river bank on this side, and the other on the river bank on that side. 
DAN.12.6	One said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be to the end of these wonders?”
DAN.12.7	I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him who lives forever that it will be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have finished breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things will be finished.
DAN.12.8	I heard, but I didn’t understand. Then I said, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?”
DAN.12.9	He said, “Go your way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end. 
DAN.12.10	Many will purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked will do wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand; but those who are wise will understand.
DAN.12.11	“From the time that the continual burnt offering is taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there will be one thousand and two hundred and ninety days. 
DAN.12.12	Blessed is he who waits, and comes to the one thousand and three hundred and thirty-five days.
DAN.12.13	“But go your way until the end; for you will rest, and will stand in your inheritance at the end of the days.”
HOS.1.1	The 
HOS.1.2	When the 
HOS.1.3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.
HOS.1.4	The 
HOS.1.5	It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.”
HOS.1.6	She conceived again, and bore a daughter.
HOS.1.6	Then he said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah
HOS.1.7	But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by the 
HOS.1.8	Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.
HOS.1.9	He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi
HOS.1.10	Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can’t be measured or counted; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’ 
HOS.1.11	The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel.
HOS.2.1	“Say to your brothers, ‘My people!’
HOS.2.1	and to your sisters, ‘My loved one!’
HOS.2.2	Contend with your mother!
HOS.2.2	Contend, for she is not my wife,
HOS.2.2	neither am I her husband;
HOS.2.2	and let her put away her prostitution from her face,
HOS.2.2	and her adulteries from between her breasts;
HOS.2.3	Lest I strip her naked,
HOS.2.3	and make her bare as in the day that she was born,
HOS.2.3	and make her like a wilderness,
HOS.2.3	and set her like a dry land,
HOS.2.3	and kill her with thirst.
HOS.2.4	Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy;
HOS.2.4	for they are children of unfaithfulness;
HOS.2.5	For their mother has played the prostitute.
HOS.2.5	She who conceived them has done shamefully;
HOS.2.5	for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,
HOS.2.5	who give me my bread and my water,
HOS.2.5	my wool and my flax,
HOS.2.5	my oil and my drink.’
HOS.2.6	Therefore behold,
HOS.2.6	and I will build a wall against her,
HOS.2.6	that she can’t find her way.
HOS.2.7	She will follow after her lovers,
HOS.2.7	but she won’t overtake them;
HOS.2.7	and she will seek them,
HOS.2.7	but won’t find them.
HOS.2.7	Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband;
HOS.2.7	for then it was better with me than now.’
HOS.2.8	For she didn’t know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,
HOS.2.8	and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
HOS.2.9	Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,
HOS.2.9	and my new wine in its season,
HOS.2.9	and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.
HOS.2.10	Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
HOS.2.10	and no one will deliver her out of my hand.
HOS.2.11	I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:
HOS.2.11	her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.
HOS.2.12	I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,
HOS.2.12	about which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me;
HOS.2.12	and I will make them a forest,’
HOS.2.12	and the animals of the field shall eat them.
HOS.2.13	I will visit on her the days of the Baals,
HOS.2.13	to which she burnt incense,
HOS.2.13	when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,
HOS.2.13	and went after her lovers,
HOS.2.13	and forgot me,” says the 
HOS.2.14	“Therefore behold, I will allure her,
HOS.2.14	and bring her into the wilderness,
HOS.2.14	and speak tenderly to her.
HOS.2.15	I will give her vineyards from there,
HOS.2.15	and the valley of Achor for a door of hope;
HOS.2.15	and she will respond there,
HOS.2.15	as in the days of her youth,
HOS.2.15	and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
HOS.2.16	It will be in that day,” says the 
HOS.2.16	“that you will call me ‘my husband,’
HOS.2.16	and no longer call me ‘my master.’
HOS.2.17	For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth,
HOS.2.17	and they will no longer be mentioned by name.
HOS.2.18	In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field,
HOS.2.18	and with the birds of the sky,
HOS.2.18	and with the creeping things of the ground.
HOS.2.18	I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land,
HOS.2.18	and will make them lie down safely.
HOS.2.19	I will betroth you to me forever.
HOS.2.19	Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion.
HOS.2.20	I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness;
HOS.2.20	and you shall know the 
HOS.2.21	It will happen in that day, I will respond,” says the 
HOS.2.21	“I will respond to the heavens,
HOS.2.21	and they will respond to the earth;
HOS.2.22	and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil;
HOS.2.22	and they will respond to Jezreel.
HOS.2.23	I will sow her to me in the earth;
HOS.2.23	and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;
HOS.2.23	and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my people;’
HOS.2.23	and they will say, ‘My God!’”
HOS.3.1	The 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer
HOS.3.3	I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with any other man. I will also be so towards you.”
HOS.3.4	For the children of Israel shall live many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without sacred stone, and without ephod or idols. 
HOS.3.5	Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek the 
HOS.4.1	Hear the 
HOS.4.1	for the 
HOS.4.1	“Indeed there is no truth,
HOS.4.1	nor goodness,
HOS.4.1	nor knowledge of God in the land.
HOS.4.2	There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;
HOS.4.2	they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed.
HOS.4.3	Therefore the land will mourn,
HOS.4.3	and everyone who dwells in it will waste away,
HOS.4.3	with all living things in her,
HOS.4.3	even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky;
HOS.4.3	yes, the fish of the sea also die.
HOS.4.4	“Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.
HOS.4.5	You will stumble in the day,
HOS.4.5	and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;
HOS.4.5	and I will destroy your mother.
HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
HOS.4.6	Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,
HOS.4.6	that you may be no priest to me.
HOS.4.6	Because you have forgotten your God’s law,
HOS.4.6	I will also forget your children.
HOS.4.7	As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.
HOS.4.7	I will change their glory into shame.
HOS.4.8	They feed on the sin of my people,
HOS.4.8	and set their heart on their iniquity.
HOS.4.9	It will be, like people, like priest;
HOS.4.9	and I will punish them for their ways,
HOS.4.9	and will repay them for their deeds.
HOS.4.10	They will eat, and not have enough.
HOS.4.10	They will play the prostitute, and will not increase;
HOS.4.10	because they have abandoned giving to the 
HOS.4.11	Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.
HOS.4.12	My people consult with their wooden idol,
HOS.4.12	and answer to a stick of wood.
HOS.4.12	Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,
HOS.4.12	and they have been unfaithful to their God.
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,
HOS.4.13	and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths,
HOS.4.13	because its shade is good.
HOS.4.13	Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,
HOS.4.13	and your brides commit adultery.
HOS.4.14	I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,
HOS.4.14	nor your brides when they commit adultery;
HOS.4.14	because the men consort with prostitutes,
HOS.4.14	and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;
HOS.4.14	so the people without understanding will come to ruin.
HOS.4.15	“Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,
HOS.4.15	yet don’t let Judah offend;
HOS.4.15	and don’t come to Gilgal,
HOS.4.15	neither go up to Beth Aven,
HOS.4.15	nor swear, ‘As the 
HOS.4.16	For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.
HOS.4.16	Then how will the 
HOS.4.17	Ephraim is joined to idols.
HOS.4.17	Leave him alone!
HOS.4.18	Their drink has become sour.
HOS.4.18	They play the prostitute continually.
HOS.4.18	Her rulers dearly love their shameful way.
HOS.4.19	The wind has wrapped her up in its wings;
HOS.4.19	and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices.
HOS.5.1	“Listen to this, you priests!
HOS.5.1	Listen, house of Israel,
HOS.5.1	and give ear, house of the king!
HOS.5.1	For the judgement is against you;
HOS.5.1	for you have been a snare at Mizpah,
HOS.5.1	and a net spread on Tabor.
HOS.5.2	The rebels are deep in slaughter;
HOS.5.2	but I discipline all of them.
HOS.5.3	I know Ephraim,
HOS.5.3	and Israel is not hidden from me;
HOS.5.3	for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute.
HOS.5.3	Israel is defiled.
HOS.5.4	Their deeds won’t allow them to turn to their God;
HOS.5.4	for the spirit of prostitution is within them,
HOS.5.4	and they don’t know the 
HOS.5.5	The pride of Israel testifies to his face.
HOS.5.5	Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity.
HOS.5.5	Judah also will stumble with them.
HOS.5.6	They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the 
HOS.5.6	but they won’t find him.
HOS.5.6	He has withdrawn himself from them.
HOS.5.7	They are unfaithful to the 
HOS.5.7	for they have borne illegitimate children.
HOS.5.7	Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.
HOS.5.8	“Blow the cornet in Gibeah,
HOS.5.8	and the trumpet in Ramah!
HOS.5.8	Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!
HOS.5.9	Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke.
HOS.5.9	Amongst the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be.
HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark.
HOS.5.10	I will pour out my wrath on them like water.
HOS.5.11	Ephraim is oppressed,
HOS.5.11	he is crushed in judgement;
HOS.5.11	Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols.
HOS.5.12	Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth,
HOS.5.12	and to the house of Judah like rottenness.
HOS.5.13	“When Ephraim saw his sickness,
HOS.5.13	and Judah his wound,
HOS.5.13	Then Ephraim went to Assyria,
HOS.5.13	and sent to king Jareb:
HOS.5.13	but he is not able to heal you,
HOS.5.13	neither will he cure you of your wound.
HOS.5.14	For I will be to Ephraim like a lion,
HOS.5.14	and like a young lion to the house of Judah.
HOS.5.14	I myself will tear in pieces and go away.
HOS.5.14	I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.
HOS.5.15	I will go and return to my place,
HOS.5.15	until they acknowledge their offence,
HOS.5.15	and seek my face.
HOS.5.15	In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.”
HOS.6.1	“Come! Let’s return to the 
HOS.6.1	for he has torn us to pieces,
HOS.6.1	and he will heal us;
HOS.6.1	he has injured us,
HOS.6.1	and he will bind up our wounds.
HOS.6.2	After two days he will revive us.
HOS.6.2	On the third day he will raise us up,
HOS.6.2	and we will live before him.
HOS.6.3	Let’s acknowledge the 
HOS.6.3	Let’s press on to know the 
HOS.6.3	As surely as the sun rises,
HOS.6.3	The 
HOS.6.3	He will come to us like the rain,
HOS.6.3	like the spring rain that waters the earth.”
HOS.6.4	“Ephraim, what shall I do to you?
HOS.6.4	Judah, what shall I do to you?
HOS.6.4	For your love is like a morning cloud,
HOS.6.4	and like the dew that disappears early.
HOS.6.5	Therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets;
HOS.6.5	I killed them with the words of my mouth.
HOS.6.5	Your judgements are like a flash of lightning.
HOS.6.6	For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice;
HOS.6.6	and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
HOS.6.7	But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant.
HOS.6.7	They were unfaithful to me, there.
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity;
HOS.6.8	it is stained with blood.
HOS.6.9	As gangs of robbers wait to ambush a man,
HOS.6.9	so the company of priests murder on the path towards Shechem,
HOS.6.9	committing shameful crimes.
HOS.6.10	In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing.
HOS.6.10	There is prostitution in Ephraim.
HOS.6.10	Israel is defiled.
HOS.6.11	“Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you,
HOS.6.11	when I restore the fortunes of my people.
HOS.7.1	When I would heal Israel,
HOS.7.1	then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,
HOS.7.1	also the wickedness of Samaria;
HOS.7.1	for they commit falsehood,
HOS.7.1	and the thief enters in,
HOS.7.1	and the gang of robbers ravages outside.
HOS.7.2	They don’t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness.
HOS.7.2	Now their own deeds have engulfed them.
HOS.7.2	They are before my face.
HOS.7.3	They make the king glad with their wickedness,
HOS.7.3	and the princes with their lies.
HOS.7.4	They are all adulterers.
HOS.7.4	They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring,
HOS.7.4	from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.
HOS.7.5	On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.
HOS.7.5	He joined his hand with mockers.
HOS.7.6	For they have prepared their heart like an oven,
HOS.7.6	while they lie in wait.
HOS.7.6	Their baker sleeps all the night.
HOS.7.6	In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.
HOS.7.7	They are all hot as an oven,
HOS.7.7	and devour their judges.
HOS.7.7	All their kings have fallen.
HOS.7.7	There is no one amongst them who calls to me.
HOS.7.8	Ephraim, he mixes himself amongst the nations.
HOS.7.8	Ephraim is a pancake not turned over.
HOS.7.9	Strangers have devoured his strength,
HOS.7.9	and he doesn’t realise it.
HOS.7.9	Indeed, grey hairs are here and there on him,
HOS.7.9	and he doesn’t realise it.
HOS.7.10	The pride of Israel testifies to his face;
HOS.7.10	yet they haven’t returned to the 
HOS.7.10	nor sought him, for all this.
HOS.7.11	“Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding.
HOS.7.11	They call to Egypt.
HOS.7.11	They go to Assyria.
HOS.7.12	When they go, I will spread my net on them.
HOS.7.12	I will bring them down like the birds of the sky.
HOS.7.12	I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.
HOS.7.13	Woe to them!
HOS.7.13	For they have wandered from me.
HOS.7.13	Destruction to them!
HOS.7.13	For they have trespassed against me.
HOS.7.13	Though I would redeem them,
HOS.7.13	yet they have spoken lies against me.
HOS.7.14	They haven’t cried to me with their heart,
HOS.7.14	but they howl on their beds.
HOS.7.14	They assemble themselves for grain and new wine.
HOS.7.14	They turn away from me.
HOS.7.15	Though I have taught and strengthened their arms,
HOS.7.15	yet they plot evil against me.
HOS.7.16	They return, but not to the Most High.
HOS.7.16	They are like a faulty bow.
HOS.7.16	Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue.
HOS.7.16	This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.
HOS.8.1	“Put the trumpet to your lips!
HOS.8.1	Something like an eagle is over the 
HOS.8.1	because they have broken my covenant,
HOS.8.1	and rebelled against my law.
HOS.8.2	They cry to me, ‘My God, we Israel acknowledge you!’
HOS.8.3	Israel has cast off that which is good.
HOS.8.3	The enemy will pursue him.
HOS.8.4	They have set up kings, but not by me.
HOS.8.4	They have made princes, and I didn’t approve.
HOS.8.4	Of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols,
HOS.8.4	that they may be cut off.
HOS.8.5	Let Samaria throw out his calf idol!
HOS.8.5	My anger burns against them!
HOS.8.5	How long will it be until they are capable of purity?
HOS.8.6	For this is even from Israel!
HOS.8.6	The workman made it, and it is no God;
HOS.8.6	indeed, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
HOS.8.7	For they sow the wind,
HOS.8.7	and they will reap the whirlwind.
HOS.8.7	He has no standing grain.
HOS.8.7	The stalk will yield no head.
HOS.8.7	If it does yield, strangers will swallow it up.
HOS.8.8	Israel is swallowed up.
HOS.8.8	Now they are amongst the nations like a worthless thing.
HOS.8.9	For they have gone up to Assyria,
HOS.8.9	like a wild donkey wandering alone.
HOS.8.9	Ephraim has hired lovers for himself.
HOS.8.10	But although they sold themselves amongst the nations,
HOS.8.10	I will now gather them;
HOS.8.10	and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones.
HOS.8.11	Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning,
HOS.8.11	they became for him altars for sinning.
HOS.8.12	I wrote for him the many things of my law;
HOS.8.12	but they were regarded as a strange thing.
HOS.8.13	As for the sacrifices of my offerings,
HOS.8.13	they sacrifice meat and eat it;
HOS.8.13	But the 
HOS.8.13	Now he will remember their iniquity,
HOS.8.13	and punish their sins.
HOS.8.13	They will return to Egypt.
HOS.8.14	For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;
HOS.8.14	and Judah has multiplied fortified cities;
HOS.8.14	but I will send a fire on his cities,
HOS.8.14	and it will devour its fortresses.”
HOS.9.1	Don’t rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations;
HOS.9.1	for you were unfaithful to your God.
HOS.9.1	You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor.
HOS.9.2	The threshing floor and the wine press won’t feed them,
HOS.9.2	and the new wine will fail her.
HOS.9.3	They won’t dwell in the 
HOS.9.3	but Ephraim will return to Egypt,
HOS.9.3	and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.
HOS.9.4	They won’t pour out wine offerings to the 
HOS.9.4	neither will they be pleasing to him.
HOS.9.4	Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners;
HOS.9.4	all who eat of it will be polluted;
HOS.9.4	for their bread will be for their appetite.
HOS.9.4	It will not come into the 
HOS.9.5	What will you do in the day of solemn assembly,
HOS.9.5	and in the day of the feast of the 
HOS.9.6	For, behold, when they flee destruction,
HOS.9.6	Egypt will gather them up.
HOS.9.6	Memphis will bury them.
HOS.9.6	Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver.
HOS.9.6	Thorns will be in their tents.
HOS.9.7	The days of visitation have come.
HOS.9.7	The days of reckoning have come.
HOS.9.7	Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool,
HOS.9.7	and the man who is inspired to be insane,
HOS.9.7	because of the abundance of your sins,
HOS.9.7	and because your hostility is great.
HOS.9.8	A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.
HOS.9.8	A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths,
HOS.9.8	and hostility in the house of his God.
HOS.9.9	They have deeply corrupted themselves,
HOS.9.9	as in the days of Gibeah.
HOS.9.9	He will remember their iniquity.
HOS.9.9	He will punish them for their sins.
HOS.9.10	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.
HOS.9.10	I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season;
HOS.9.10	but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing,
HOS.9.10	and became abominable like that which they loved.
HOS.9.11	As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird.
HOS.9.11	There will be no birth, no one with child, and no conception.
HOS.9.12	Though they bring up their children,
HOS.9.12	yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left.
HOS.9.12	Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!
HOS.9.13	I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place;
HOS.9.13	but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer.
HOS.9.14	Give them—
HOS.9.14	Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
HOS.9.15	“All their wickedness is in Gilgal;
HOS.9.15	for there I hated them.
HOS.9.15	Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house!
HOS.9.15	I will love them no more.
HOS.9.15	All their princes are rebels.
HOS.9.16	Ephraim is struck.
HOS.9.16	Their root has dried up.
HOS.9.16	They will bear no fruit.
HOS.9.16	Even though they give birth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.”
HOS.9.17	My God will cast them away, because they didn’t listen to him;
HOS.9.17	and they will be wanderers amongst the nations.
HOS.10.1	Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit.
HOS.10.1	According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars.
HOS.10.1	As their land has prospered, they have adorned their sacred stones.
HOS.10.2	Their heart is divided.
HOS.10.2	Now they will be found guilty.
HOS.10.2	He will demolish their altars.
HOS.10.2	He will destroy their sacred stones.
HOS.10.3	Surely now they will say, “We have no king; for we don’t fear the 
HOS.10.3	and the king, what can he do for us?”
HOS.10.4	They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants.
HOS.10.4	Therefore judgement springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
HOS.10.5	The inhabitants of Samaria will be in terror for the calves of Beth Aven;
HOS.10.5	for its people will mourn over it,
HOS.10.5	Along with its priests who rejoiced over it,
HOS.10.5	for its glory, because it has departed from it.
HOS.10.6	It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king.
HOS.10.6	Ephraim will receive shame,
HOS.10.6	and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel.
HOS.10.7	Samaria and her king float away,
HOS.10.7	like a twig on the water.
HOS.10.8	The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed.
HOS.10.8	The thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars.
HOS.10.8	They will tell the mountains, “Cover us!” and the hills, “Fall on us!”
HOS.10.9	“Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah.
HOS.10.9	There they remained.
HOS.10.9	The battle against the children of iniquity doesn’t overtake them in Gibeah.
HOS.10.10	When it is my desire, I will chastise them;
HOS.10.10	and the nations will be gathered against them,
HOS.10.10	when they are bound to their two transgressions.
HOS.10.11	Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh;
HOS.10.11	so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck.
HOS.10.11	I will set a rider on Ephraim.
HOS.10.11	Judah will plough.
HOS.10.11	Jacob will break his clods.
HOS.10.12	Sow to yourselves in righteousness,
HOS.10.12	reap according to kindness.
HOS.10.12	Break up your fallow ground;
HOS.10.12	for it is time to seek the 
HOS.10.12	until he comes and rains righteousness on you.
HOS.10.13	You have ploughed wickedness.
HOS.10.13	You have reaped iniquity.
HOS.10.13	You have eaten the fruit of lies,
HOS.10.13	for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.
HOS.10.14	Therefore a battle roar will arise amongst your people,
HOS.10.14	and all your fortresses will be destroyed,
HOS.10.14	as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle.
HOS.10.14	The mother was dashed in pieces with her children.
HOS.10.15	So Bethel will do to you because of your great wickedness.
HOS.10.15	At daybreak the king of Israel will be destroyed.
HOS.11.1	“When Israel was a child, then I loved him,
HOS.11.1	and called my son out of Egypt.
HOS.11.2	They called to them, so they went from them.
HOS.11.2	They sacrificed to the Baals,
HOS.11.2	and burnt incense to engraved images.
HOS.11.3	Yet I taught Ephraim to walk.
HOS.11.3	I took them by his arms;
HOS.11.3	but they didn’t know that I healed them.
HOS.11.4	I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love;
HOS.11.4	and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks;
HOS.11.4	and I bent down to him and I fed him.
HOS.11.5	“They won’t return into the land of Egypt;
HOS.11.5	but the Assyrian will be their king,
HOS.11.5	because they refused to repent.
HOS.11.6	The sword will fall on their cities,
HOS.11.6	and will destroy the bars of their gates,
HOS.11.6	and will put an end to their plans.
HOS.11.7	My people are determined to turn from me.
HOS.11.7	Though they call to the Most High,
HOS.11.7	he certainly won’t exalt them.
HOS.11.8	“How can I give you up, Ephraim?
HOS.11.8	How can I hand you over, Israel?
HOS.11.8	How can I make you like Admah?
HOS.11.8	How can I make you like Zeboiim?
HOS.11.8	My heart is turned within me,
HOS.11.8	my compassion is aroused.
HOS.11.9	I will not execute the fierceness of my anger.
HOS.11.9	I will not return to destroy Ephraim:
HOS.11.9	for I am God, and not man; the Holy One amongst you;
HOS.11.9	and I will not come in wrath.
HOS.11.10	They will walk after the 
HOS.11.10	who will roar like a lion;
HOS.11.10	for he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west.
HOS.11.11	They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt,
HOS.11.11	and like a dove out of the land of Assyria;
HOS.11.11	and I will settle them in their houses,” says the 
HOS.11.12	Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood,
HOS.11.12	and the house of Israel with deceit.
HOS.11.12	Judah still strays from God,
HOS.11.12	and is unfaithful to the Holy One.
HOS.12.1	Ephraim feeds on wind,
HOS.12.1	and chases the east wind.
HOS.12.1	He continually multiplies lies and desolation.
HOS.12.1	They make a covenant with Assyria,
HOS.12.1	and oil is carried into Egypt.
HOS.12.2	The 
HOS.12.2	and will punish Jacob according to his ways;
HOS.12.2	according to his deeds he will repay him.
HOS.12.3	In the womb he took his brother by the heel;
HOS.12.3	and in his manhood he contended with God.
HOS.12.4	Indeed, he struggled with the angel, and prevailed;
HOS.12.4	he wept, and made supplication to him.
HOS.12.4	He found him at Bethel, and there he spoke with us,
HOS.12.5	even the 
HOS.12.5	The 
HOS.12.6	Therefore turn to your God.
HOS.12.6	Keep kindness and justice,
HOS.12.6	and wait continually for your God.
HOS.12.7	A merchant has dishonest scales in his hand.
HOS.12.7	He loves to defraud.
HOS.12.8	Ephraim said, “Surely I have become rich,
HOS.12.8	I have found myself wealth.
HOS.12.8	In all my wealth they won’t find in me any iniquity that is sin.”
HOS.12.9	“But I am the 
HOS.12.9	I will yet again make you dwell in tents,
HOS.12.9	as in the days of the solemn feast.
HOS.12.10	I have also spoken to the prophets,
HOS.12.10	and I have multiplied visions;
HOS.12.10	and by the ministry of the prophets I have used parables.
HOS.12.11	If Gilead is wicked,
HOS.12.11	surely they are worthless.
HOS.12.11	In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls.
HOS.12.11	Indeed, their altars are like heaps in the furrows of the field.
HOS.12.12	Jacob fled into the country of Aram,
HOS.12.12	and Israel served to get a wife,
HOS.12.12	and for a wife he tended flocks and herds.
HOS.12.13	By a prophet the 
HOS.12.13	and by a prophet he was preserved.
HOS.12.14	Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger.
HOS.12.14	Therefore his blood will be left on him,
HOS.12.14	and his Lord
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling.
HOS.13.1	He exalted himself in Israel,
HOS.13.1	but when he became guilty in Baal, he died.
HOS.13.2	Now they sin more and more,
HOS.13.2	and have made themselves molten images of their silver,
HOS.13.2	even idols according to their own understanding,
HOS.13.2	all of them the work of the craftsmen.
HOS.13.2	They say of them, ‘They offer human sacrifice and kiss the calves.’
HOS.13.3	Therefore they will be like the morning mist,
HOS.13.3	and like the dew that passes away early,
HOS.13.3	like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor,
HOS.13.3	and like the smoke out of the chimney.
HOS.13.4	“Yet I am the 
HOS.13.4	and you shall acknowledge no god but me,
HOS.13.4	and besides me there is no saviour.
HOS.13.5	I knew you in the wilderness,
HOS.13.5	in the land of great drought.
HOS.13.6	According to their pasture, so were they filled;
HOS.13.6	they were filled, and their heart was exalted.
HOS.13.6	Therefore they have forgotten me.
HOS.13.7	Therefore I am like a lion to them.
HOS.13.7	Like a leopard, I will lurk by the path.
HOS.13.8	I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs,
HOS.13.8	and will tear the covering of their heart.
HOS.13.8	There I will devour them like a lioness.
HOS.13.8	The wild animal will tear them.
HOS.13.9	You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me,
HOS.13.9	against your help.
HOS.13.10	Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities?
HOS.13.10	And your judges, of whom you said, ‘Give me a king and princes’?
HOS.13.11	I have given you a king in my anger,
HOS.13.11	and have taken him away in my wrath.
HOS.13.12	The guilt of Ephraim is stored up.
HOS.13.12	His sin is stored up.
HOS.13.13	The sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him.
HOS.13.13	He is an unwise son;
HOS.13.13	for when it is time, he doesn’t come to the opening of the womb.
HOS.13.14	I will ransom them from the power of Sheol.
HOS.13.14	I will redeem them from death!
HOS.13.14	Death, where are your plagues?
HOS.13.14	Sheol, where is your destruction?
HOS.13.14	“Compassion will be hidden from my eyes.
HOS.13.15	Though he is fruitful amongst his brothers, an east wind will come,
HOS.13.15	the breath of the 
HOS.13.15	and his spring will become dry,
HOS.13.15	and his fountain will be dried up.
HOS.13.15	He will plunder the storehouse of treasure.
HOS.13.16	Samaria will bear her guilt;
HOS.13.16	for she has rebelled against her God.
HOS.13.16	They will fall by the sword.
HOS.13.16	Their infants will be dashed in pieces,
HOS.13.16	and their pregnant women will be ripped open.”
HOS.14.1	Israel, return to the 
HOS.14.1	for you have fallen because of your sin.
HOS.14.2	Take words with you, and return to the 
HOS.14.2	Tell him, “Forgive all our sins,
HOS.14.2	and accept that which is good:
HOS.14.2	so we offer our lips like bulls.
HOS.14.3	Assyria can’t save us.

HOS.14.4	I will love them freely;
HOS.14.4	for my anger is turned away from him.
HOS.14.5	I will be like the dew to Israel.
HOS.14.5	He will blossom like the lily,
HOS.14.5	and send down his roots like Lebanon.
HOS.14.6	His branches will spread,
HOS.14.6	and his beauty will be like the olive tree,
HOS.14.6	and his fragrance like Lebanon.
HOS.14.7	Men will dwell in his shade.
HOS.14.7	They will revive like the grain,

HOS.14.7	Their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon.

JOL.1.1	The 
JOL.1.2	Hear this, you elders,
JOL.1.2	And listen, all you inhabitants of the land.
JOL.1.2	Has this ever happened in your days,
JOL.1.2	or in the days of your fathers?
JOL.1.3	Tell your children about it,
JOL.1.3	and have your children tell their children,
JOL.1.3	and their children, another generation.
JOL.1.4	What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten.
JOL.1.4	What the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten.
JOL.1.4	What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten.
JOL.1.5	Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!
JOL.1.5	Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine;
JOL.1.5	for it is cut off from your mouth.
JOL.1.6	For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number.
JOL.1.6	His teeth are the teeth of a lion,
JOL.1.6	and he has the fangs of a lioness.
JOL.1.7	He has laid my vine waste,
JOL.1.7	and stripped my fig tree.
JOL.1.7	He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away.
JOL.1.7	Its branches are made white.
JOL.1.8	Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth! 
JOL.1.9	The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from the 
JOL.1.9	The priests, the 
JOL.1.10	The field is laid waste.
JOL.1.10	The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed,
JOL.1.10	The new wine has dried up,
JOL.1.10	and the oil languishes.
JOL.1.11	Be confounded, you farmers!
JOL.1.11	Wail, you vineyard keepers;
JOL.1.11	for the wheat and for the barley;
JOL.1.11	for the harvest of the field has perished.
JOL.1.12	The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered;
JOL.1.12	the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree,
JOL.1.12	even all of the trees of the field are withered;
JOL.1.12	for joy has withered away from the sons of men.
JOL.1.13	Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests!
JOL.1.13	Wail, you ministers of the altar.
JOL.1.13	Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God,
JOL.1.13	for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your God’s house.
JOL.1.14	Sanctify a fast.
JOL.1.14	Call a solemn assembly.
JOL.1.14	Gather the elders,
JOL.1.14	and all the inhabitants of the land, to the house of the

JOL.1.16	Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes,
JOL.1.16	joy and gladness from the house of our God?
JOL.1.17	The seeds rot under their clods.
JOL.1.17	The granaries are laid desolate.
JOL.1.17	The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered.
JOL.1.18	How the animals groan!
JOL.1.18	The herds of livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture.
JOL.1.18	Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
JOL.1.19	The

JOL.1.20	Yes, the animals of the field pant to you,
JOL.1.20	for the water brooks have dried up,
JOL.1.20	And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
JOL.2.1	Blow the trumpet in Zion,
JOL.2.1	and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!
JOL.2.1	Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
JOL.2.1	for the day of the 
JOL.2.1	for it is close at hand:
JOL.2.2	A day of darkness and gloominess,
JOL.2.2	a day of clouds and thick darkness.
JOL.2.2	As the dawn spreading on the mountains,
JOL.2.2	a great and strong people;
JOL.2.2	there has never been the like,
JOL.2.2	neither will there be any more after them,
JOL.2.2	even to the years of many generations.
JOL.2.3	A fire devours before them,
JOL.2.3	and behind them, a flame burns.
JOL.2.3	The land is as the garden of Eden before them,
JOL.2.3	and behind them, a desolate wilderness.
JOL.2.3	Yes, and no one has escaped them.
JOL.2.4	Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,
JOL.2.4	and they run as horsemen.
JOL.2.5	Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap,
JOL.2.5	like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,
JOL.2.5	like a strong people set in battle array.
JOL.2.6	At their presence the peoples are in anguish.
JOL.2.6	All faces have grown pale.
JOL.2.7	They run like mighty men.
JOL.2.7	They climb the wall like warriors.
JOL.2.7	They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course.
JOL.2.8	Neither does one jostle another;
JOL.2.8	they march everyone in his path,
JOL.2.8	and they burst through the defences,
JOL.2.8	and don’t break ranks.
JOL.2.9	They rush on the city.
JOL.2.9	They run on the wall.
JOL.2.9	They climb up into the houses.
JOL.2.9	They enter in at the windows like thieves.
JOL.2.10	The earth quakes before them.
JOL.2.10	The heavens tremble.
JOL.2.10	The sun and the moon are darkened,
JOL.2.10	and the stars withdraw their shining.
JOL.2.11	The 
JOL.2.11	for his forces are very great;
JOL.2.11	for he is strong who obeys his command;
JOL.2.11	for the day of the

JOL.2.12	“Yet even now,” says the 
JOL.2.12	and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.”
JOL.2.13	Tear your heart, and not your garments,
JOL.2.13	and turn to the 
JOL.2.13	for he is gracious and merciful,
JOL.2.13	slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,
JOL.2.13	and relents from sending calamity.
JOL.2.14	Who knows? He may turn and relent,
JOL.2.14	and leave a blessing behind him,
JOL.2.14	even a meal offering and a drink offering to the 
JOL.2.15	Blow the trumpet in Zion!
JOL.2.15	Sanctify a fast.
JOL.2.15	Call a solemn assembly.
JOL.2.16	Gather the people.
JOL.2.16	Sanctify the assembly.
JOL.2.16	Assemble the elders.
JOL.2.16	Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts.
JOL.2.16	Let the bridegroom go out of his room,
JOL.2.16	and the bride out of her room.
JOL.2.17	Let the priests, the ministers of the 
JOL.2.17	and let them say, “Spare your people, 
JOL.2.17	and don’t give your heritage to reproach,
JOL.2.17	that the nations should rule over them.
JOL.2.17	Why should they say amongst the peoples,
JOL.2.17	‘Where is their God?’”
JOL.2.18	Then the 
JOL.2.18	And had pity on his people.
JOL.2.19	The 
JOL.2.19	“Behold,
JOL.2.19	and you will be satisfied with them;
JOL.2.19	and I will no more make you a reproach amongst the nations.
JOL.2.20	But I will remove the northern army far away from you,
JOL.2.20	and will drive it into a barren and desolate land,
JOL.2.20	its front into the eastern sea,
JOL.2.20	and its back into the western sea;
JOL.2.20	and its stench will come up,
JOL.2.20	and its bad smell will rise.”
JOL.2.20	Surely he has done great things.
JOL.2.21	Land, don’t be afraid.
JOL.2.21	Be glad and rejoice, for the 
JOL.2.22	Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field;
JOL.2.22	for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,
JOL.2.22	for the tree bears its fruit.
JOL.2.22	The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.
JOL.2.23	“Be glad then, you children of Zion,
JOL.2.23	and rejoice in the 
JOL.2.23	for he gives you the early rain in just measure,
JOL.2.23	and he causes the rain to come down for you,
JOL.2.23	the early rain and the latter rain,
JOL.2.23	as before.
JOL.2.24	The threshing floors will be full of wheat,
JOL.2.24	and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
JOL.2.25	I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,
JOL.2.25	the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar,
JOL.2.25	my great army, which I sent amongst you.
JOL.2.26	You will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied,
JOL.2.26	and will praise the name of the 
JOL.2.26	who has dealt wondrously with you;
JOL.2.26	and my people will never again be disappointed.
JOL.2.27	You will know that I am amongst Israel,
JOL.2.27	and that I am the 
JOL.2.27	and my people will never again be disappointed.
JOL.2.28	“It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;
JOL.2.28	and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.
JOL.2.28	Your old men will dream dreams.
JOL.2.28	Your young men will see visions.
JOL.2.29	And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,
JOL.2.29	I will pour out my Spirit.
JOL.2.30	I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:
JOL.2.30	blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.
JOL.2.31	The sun will be turned into darkness,
JOL.2.31	and the moon into blood,
JOL.2.31	before the great and terrible day of the 
JOL.2.32	It will happen that whoever will call on the 
JOL.2.32	for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,
JOL.2.32	as the 
JOL.2.32	and amongst the remnant, those whom the 
JOL.3.1	“For, behold, in those days,
JOL.3.1	and in that time,
JOL.3.1	when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
JOL.3.2	I will gather all nations,
JOL.3.2	and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;
JOL.3.2	and I will execute judgement on them there for my people,
JOL.3.2	and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered amongst the nations.
JOL.3.2	They have divided my land,
JOL.3.3	and have cast lots for my people,
JOL.3.3	and have given a boy for a prostitute,
JOL.3.3	and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.
JOL.3.4	“Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon,
JOL.3.4	and all the regions of Philistia?
JOL.3.4	Will you repay me?
JOL.3.4	And if you repay me,
JOL.3.4	I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.
JOL.3.5	Because you have taken my silver and my gold,
JOL.3.5	and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,
JOL.3.6	and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,
JOL.3.6	that you may remove them far from their border.
JOL.3.7	Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them,
JOL.3.7	and will return your repayment on your own head;
JOL.3.8	and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah,
JOL.3.8	and they will sell them to the men of Sheba,
JOL.3.8	to a faraway nation,

JOL.3.9	Stir up the mighty men.
JOL.3.9	Let all the warriors draw near.
JOL.3.9	Let them come up. 
JOL.3.10	Beat your ploughshares into swords,
JOL.3.10	and your pruning hooks into spears.
JOL.3.10	Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’
JOL.3.11	Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,
JOL.3.11	and gather yourselves together.”
JOL.3.11	Cause your mighty ones to come down there, 
JOL.3.12	“Let the nations arouse themselves,
JOL.3.12	and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;
JOL.3.12	for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
JOL.3.13	Put in the sickle;
JOL.3.13	for the harvest is ripe.
JOL.3.13	Come, tread, for the wine press is full,
JOL.3.13	the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.”
JOL.3.14	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!
JOL.3.14	For the day of the 
JOL.3.15	The sun and the moon are darkened,
JOL.3.15	and the stars withdraw their shining.
JOL.3.16	The 
JOL.3.16	and thunder from Jerusalem;
JOL.3.16	and the heavens and the earth will shake;
JOL.3.16	but the 
JOL.3.16	and a stronghold to the children of Israel.
JOL.3.17	“So you will know that I am the 
JOL.3.17	dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.
JOL.3.17	Then Jerusalem will be holy,
JOL.3.17	and no strangers will pass through her any more.
JOL.3.18	It will happen in that day,
JOL.3.18	that the mountains will drop down sweet wine,
JOL.3.18	the hills will flow with milk,
JOL.3.18	all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters,
JOL.3.18	and a fountain will flow out from the 
JOL.3.18	and will water the valley of Shittim.
JOL.3.19	Egypt will be a desolation,
JOL.3.19	and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,
JOL.3.19	for the violence done to the children of Judah,
JOL.3.19	because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
JOL.3.20	But Judah will be inhabited forever,
JOL.3.20	and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
JOL.3.21	I will cleanse their blood,
JOL.3.21	that I have not cleansed:
JOL.3.21	for the 
AMO.1.1	The words of Amos, who was amongst the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. 
AMO.1.2	He said:
AMO.1.2	“The 
AMO.1.2	and utter his voice from Jerusalem;
AMO.1.2	and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn,
AMO.1.2	and the top of Carmel will wither.”
AMO.1.3	The 
AMO.1.3	“For three transgressions of Damascus, yes, for four,
AMO.1.3	I will not turn away its punishment;
AMO.1.3	because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron;
AMO.1.4	but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael,
AMO.1.4	and it will devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.
AMO.1.5	I will break the bar of Damascus,
AMO.1.5	and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven,
AMO.1.5	and him who holds the sceptre from the house of Eden;
AMO.1.5	and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir,”
AMO.1.5	says the 
AMO.1.6	The 
AMO.1.6	“For three transgressions of Gaza, yes, for four,
AMO.1.6	I will not turn away its punishment;
AMO.1.6	because they carried away captive the whole community,
AMO.1.6	to deliver them up to Edom;
AMO.1.7	but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza,
AMO.1.7	and it will devour its palaces.
AMO.1.8	I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,
AMO.1.8	and him who holds the sceptre from Ashkelon;
AMO.1.8	and I will turn my hand against Ekron;
AMO.1.8	and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,”
AMO.1.8	says the Lord
AMO.1.9	The 
AMO.1.9	“For three transgressions of Tyre, yes, for four,
AMO.1.9	I will not turn away its punishment;
AMO.1.9	because they delivered up the whole community to Edom,
AMO.1.9	and didn’t remember the brotherly covenant;
AMO.1.10	but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre,
AMO.1.10	and it will devour its palaces.”
AMO.1.11	The 
AMO.1.11	“For three transgressions of Edom, yes, for four,
AMO.1.11	I will not turn away its punishment;
AMO.1.11	because he pursued his brother with the sword,
AMO.1.11	and cast off all pity,
AMO.1.11	and his anger raged continually,
AMO.1.11	and he kept his wrath forever;
AMO.1.12	but I will send a fire on Teman,
AMO.1.12	and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah.”
AMO.1.13	The 
AMO.1.13	“For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yes, for four,
AMO.1.13	I will not turn away its punishment;
AMO.1.13	because they have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead,
AMO.1.13	that they may enlarge their border.
AMO.1.14	But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah,
AMO.1.14	and it will devour its palaces,
AMO.1.14	with shouting in the day of battle,
AMO.1.14	with a storm in the day of the whirlwind;
AMO.1.15	and their king will go into captivity,
AMO.1.15	he and his princes together,”
AMO.1.15	says the 
AMO.2.1	The 
AMO.2.1	“For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four,
AMO.2.1	I will not turn away its punishment;
AMO.2.1	because he burnt the bones of the king of Edom into lime;
AMO.2.2	but I will send a fire on Moab,
AMO.2.2	and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth;
AMO.2.2	and Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;
AMO.2.3	and I will cut off the judge from amongst them,
AMO.2.3	and will kill all its princes with him,”
AMO.2.3	says the 
AMO.2.4	The 
AMO.2.4	“For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four,
AMO.2.4	I will not turn away its punishment;
AMO.2.4	because they have rejected the 
AMO.2.4	and have not kept his statutes,
AMO.2.4	and their lies have led them astray,
AMO.2.4	after which their fathers walked;
AMO.2.5	but I will send a fire on Judah,
AMO.2.5	and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.”
AMO.2.6	The 
AMO.2.6	“For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four,
AMO.2.6	I will not turn away its punishment;
AMO.2.6	because they have sold the righteous for silver,
AMO.2.6	and the needy for a pair of sandals;
AMO.2.7	They trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor,
AMO.2.7	and deny justice to the oppressed;
AMO.2.7	and a man and his father use the same maiden, to profane my holy name;
AMO.2.8	and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge;
AMO.2.8	and in the house of their God
AMO.2.9	Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them,
AMO.2.9	whose height was like the height of the cedars,
AMO.2.9	and he was strong as the oaks;
AMO.2.9	yet I destroyed his fruit from above,
AMO.2.9	and his roots from beneath.
AMO.2.10	Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,
AMO.2.10	and led you forty years in the wilderness,
AMO.2.10	to possess the land of the Amorite.
AMO.2.11	I raised up some of your sons for prophets,
AMO.2.11	and some of your young men for Nazirites.
AMO.2.11	Isn’t this true,
AMO.2.11	you children of Israel?” says the 
AMO.2.12	“But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink,
AMO.2.12	and commanded the prophets, saying, ‘Don’t prophesy!’
AMO.2.13	Behold,
AMO.2.13	as a cart crushes that is full of grain.
AMO.2.14	Flight will perish from the swift;
AMO.2.14	and the strong won’t strengthen his force;
AMO.2.14	neither shall the mighty deliver himself;
AMO.2.15	neither shall he stand who handles the bow;
AMO.2.15	and he who is swift of foot won’t escape;
AMO.2.15	neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself;
AMO.2.16	and he who is courageous amongst the mighty will flee away naked on that day,”
AMO.2.16	says the 
AMO.3.1	Hear this word that the 
AMO.3.2	“I have only chosen you of all the families of the earth.
AMO.3.2	Therefore I will punish you for all of your sins.”
AMO.3.3	Do two walk together,
AMO.3.3	unless they have agreed?
AMO.3.4	Will a lion roar in the thicket,
AMO.3.4	when he has no prey?
AMO.3.4	Does a young lion cry out of his den,
AMO.3.4	if he has caught nothing?
AMO.3.5	Can a bird fall in a trap on the earth,
AMO.3.5	where no snare is set for him?
AMO.3.5	Does a snare spring up from the ground,
AMO.3.5	when there is nothing to catch?
AMO.3.6	Does the trumpet alarm sound in a city,
AMO.3.6	without the people being afraid?
AMO.3.6	Does evil happen to a city,
AMO.3.6	and the 
AMO.3.7	Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing,
AMO.3.7	unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.
AMO.3.8	The lion has roared.
AMO.3.8	Who will not fear?
AMO.3.8	The Lord GOD has spoken.
AMO.3.8	Who can but prophesy?
AMO.3.9	Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod,
AMO.3.9	and in the palaces in the land of Egypt,
AMO.3.9	and say, “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria,
AMO.3.9	and see what unrest is in her,
AMO.3.9	and what oppression is amongst them.”
AMO.3.10	“Indeed they don’t know to do right,” says the 
AMO.3.10	“Who hoard plunder and loot in their palaces.”
AMO.3.11	Therefore the Lord GOD says:
AMO.3.11	“An adversary will overrun the land;
AMO.3.11	and he will pull down your strongholds,
AMO.3.11	and your fortresses will be plundered.”
AMO.3.12	The 
AMO.3.12	“As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs,
AMO.3.12	or a piece of an ear,
AMO.3.12	so shall the children of Israel be rescued who sit in Samaria on the corner of a couch,
AMO.3.12	and on the silken cushions of a bed.”
AMO.3.13	“Listen, and testify against the house of Jacob,” says the Lord GOD, the God of Armies.
AMO.3.14	“For in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him,
AMO.3.14	I will also visit the altars of Bethel;
AMO.3.14	and the horns of the altar will be cut off,
AMO.3.14	and fall to the ground.
AMO.3.15	I will strike the winter house with the summer house;
AMO.3.15	and the houses of ivory will perish,
AMO.3.15	and the great houses will have an end,”
AMO.3.15	says the 
AMO.4.1	Listen to this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who tell their husbands, “Bring us drinks!”
AMO.4.2	The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness that behold,
AMO.4.2	“The days shall come on you that they will take you away with hooks,
AMO.4.2	and the last of you with fish hooks.
AMO.4.3	You will go out at the breaks in the wall,
AMO.4.3	everyone straight before her;
AMO.4.3	and you will cast yourselves into Harmon,” says the 
AMO.4.4	“Go to Bethel, and sin;
AMO.4.4	to Gilgal, and sin more.
AMO.4.4	Bring your sacrifices every morning,
AMO.4.4	your tithes every three days,
AMO.4.5	offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened,
AMO.4.5	and proclaim free will offerings and brag about them:
AMO.4.5	for this pleases you, you children of Israel,” says the Lord GOD.
AMO.4.6	“I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,
AMO.4.6	and lack of bread in every town;
AMO.4.6	yet you haven’t returned to me,” says the 
AMO.4.7	“I also have withheld the rain from you,
AMO.4.7	when there were yet three months to the harvest;
AMO.4.7	and I caused it to rain on one city,
AMO.4.7	and caused it not to rain on another city.
AMO.4.7	One field was rained on,
AMO.4.7	and the field where it didn’t rain withered.
AMO.4.8	So two or three cities staggered to one city to drink water,
AMO.4.8	and were not satisfied:
AMO.4.8	yet you haven’t returned to me,” says the 
AMO.4.9	“I struck you with blight and mildew many times in your gardens and your vineyards;
AMO.4.9	and the swarming locusts have devoured your fig trees and your olive trees;
AMO.4.9	yet you haven’t returned to me,” says the 
AMO.4.10	“I sent plagues amongst you like I did Egypt.
AMO.4.10	I have slain your young men with the sword,
AMO.4.10	and have carried away your horses;
AMO.4.10	and I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camp,
AMO.4.10	yet you haven’t returned to me,” says the 
AMO.4.11	“I have overthrown some of you,
AMO.4.11	as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,
AMO.4.11	and you were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire;
AMO.4.11	yet you haven’t returned to me,” says the 
AMO.4.12	“Therefore thus I will do to you, Israel;
AMO.4.12	because I will do this to you,
AMO.4.12	prepare to meet your God, Israel.
AMO.4.13	For, behold, he who forms the mountains,
AMO.4.13	and creates the wind,
AMO.4.13	and declares to man what is his thought;
AMO.4.13	who makes the morning darkness,
AMO.4.13	and treads on the high places of the earth:
AMO.4.13	The 
AMO.5.1	Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.
AMO.5.2	“The virgin of Israel has fallen;
AMO.5.2	She shall rise no more.
AMO.5.2	She is cast down on her land;
AMO.5.2	there is no one to raise her up.”
AMO.5.3	For the Lord GOD says:
AMO.5.3	“The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left,
AMO.5.3	and that which went out one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.”
AMO.5.4	For the 
AMO.5.4	“Seek me, and you will live;
AMO.5.5	but don’t seek Bethel,
AMO.5.5	nor enter into Gilgal,
AMO.5.5	and don’t pass to Beersheba:
AMO.5.5	for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,
AMO.5.5	and Bethel shall come to nothing.
AMO.5.6	Seek the 
AMO.5.6	lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,
AMO.5.6	and it devour, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel.
AMO.5.7	You who turn justice to wormwood,
AMO.5.7	and cast down righteousness to the earth:
AMO.5.8	seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion,
AMO.5.8	and turns the shadow of death into the morning,
AMO.5.8	and makes the day dark with night;
AMO.5.8	who calls for the waters of the sea,
AMO.5.8	and pours them out on the surface of the earth, the 
AMO.5.9	who brings sudden destruction on the strong,
AMO.5.9	so that destruction comes on the fortress.
AMO.5.10	They hate him who reproves in the gate,
AMO.5.10	and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly.
AMO.5.11	Therefore, because you trample on the poor,
AMO.5.11	and take taxes from him of wheat:
AMO.5.11	You have built houses of cut stone,
AMO.5.11	but you will not dwell in them.
AMO.5.11	You have planted pleasant vineyards,
AMO.5.11	but you shall not drink their wine.
AMO.5.12	For I know how many are your offences,
AMO.5.12	and how great are your sins—
AMO.5.12	you who afflict the just,
AMO.5.12	who take a bribe,
AMO.5.12	and who turn away the needy in the courts.
AMO.5.13	Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time,
AMO.5.13	for it is an evil time.
AMO.5.14	Seek good, and not evil,
AMO.5.14	that you may live;
AMO.5.14	and so the 
AMO.5.14	as you say.
AMO.5.15	Hate evil, love good,
AMO.5.15	and establish justice in the courts.
AMO.5.15	It may be that the 
AMO.5.16	Therefore the 
AMO.5.16	“Wailing will be in all the wide ways;
AMO.5.16	and they will say in all the streets, ‘Alas! Alas!’
AMO.5.16	and they will call the farmer to mourning,
AMO.5.16	and those who are skilful in lamentation to wailing.
AMO.5.17	In all vineyards there will be wailing;
AMO.5.17	for I will pass through the middle of you,” says the 
AMO.5.18	“Woe to you who desire the day of the 
AMO.5.18	Why do you long for the day of the 
AMO.5.18	It is darkness,
AMO.5.18	and not light.
AMO.5.19	As if a man fled from a lion,
AMO.5.19	and a bear met him;
AMO.5.19	Or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall,
AMO.5.19	and a snake bit him.
AMO.5.20	Won’t the day of the 
AMO.5.20	Even very dark, and no brightness in it?
AMO.5.21	I hate, I despise your feasts,
AMO.5.21	and I can’t stand your solemn assemblies.
AMO.5.22	Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings,
AMO.5.22	I will not accept them;
AMO.5.22	neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.
AMO.5.23	Take away from me the noise of your songs!
AMO.5.23	I will not listen to the music of your harps.
AMO.5.24	But let justice roll on like rivers,
AMO.5.24	and righteousness like a mighty stream.
AMO.5.25	“Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, house of Israel? 
AMO.5.26	You also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves. 
AMO.5.27	Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,” says the 
AMO.6.1	Woe to those who are at ease in Zion,
AMO.6.1	and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samaria,
AMO.6.1	the notable men of the chief of the nations,
AMO.6.1	to whom the house of Israel come!
AMO.6.2	Go to Calneh, and see;
AMO.6.2	and from there go to Hamath the great;
AMO.6.2	then go down to Gath of the Philistines.
AMO.6.2	are they better than these kingdoms?
AMO.6.2	or is their border greater than your border?
AMO.6.3	Those who put far away the evil day,
AMO.6.3	and cause the seat of violence to come near;
AMO.6.4	Who lie on beds of ivory,
AMO.6.4	and stretch themselves on their couches,
AMO.6.4	and eat the lambs out of the flock,
AMO.6.4	and the calves out of the middle of the stall;
AMO.6.5	who strum on the strings of a harp;
AMO.6.5	who invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;
AMO.6.6	who drink wine in bowls,
AMO.6.6	and anoint themselves with the best oils;
AMO.6.6	but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
AMO.6.7	Therefore they will now go captive with the first who go captive;
AMO.6.7	and the feasting and lounging will end.
AMO.6.8	“The Lord GOD has sworn by himself,” says the 
AMO.6.8	“I abhor the pride of Jacob,
AMO.6.8	and detest his fortresses.
AMO.6.8	Therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is in it.
AMO.6.9	It will happen, if there remain ten men in one house,
AMO.6.9	that they shall die.
AMO.6.10	“When a man’s relative carries him, even he who burns him, to bring bodies out of the house, and asks him who is in the innermost parts of the house, ‘Is there yet any with you?’ And he says, ‘No;’ then he will say, ‘Hush! Indeed we must not mention the 
AMO.6.11	“For, behold, the 
AMO.6.11	and the little house into bits.
AMO.6.12	Do horses run on the rocky crags?
AMO.6.12	Does one plough there with oxen?
AMO.6.12	But you have turned justice into poison,
AMO.6.12	and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness;
AMO.6.13	you who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say,
AMO.6.13	‘Haven’t we taken for ourselves horns by our own strength?’
AMO.6.14	For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, house of Israel,”
AMO.6.14	says the 
AMO.6.14	“and they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.”
AMO.7.1	Thus the Lord GOD showed me: and behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and behold, it was the latter growth after the king’s harvest. 
AMO.7.2	When they finished eating the grass of the land, then I said, “Lord GOD, forgive, I beg you! How could Jacob stand? For he is small.”
AMO.7.3	The 
AMO.7.4	Thus the Lord GOD showed me and behold, the Lord GOD called for judgement by fire; and it dried up the great deep, and would have devoured the land. 
AMO.7.5	Then I said, “Lord GOD, stop, I beg you! How could Jacob stand? For he is small.”
AMO.7.6	The 
AMO.7.7	Thus he showed me and behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. 
AMO.7.8	The 
AMO.7.8	I said, “A plumb line.”
AMO.7.8	Then the Lord said, “Behold, I will set a plumb line in the middle of my people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more. 
AMO.7.9	The high places of Isaac will be desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the middle of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words. 
AMO.7.11	For Amos says, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’”
AMO.7.12	Amaziah also said to Amos, “You seer, go, flee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: 
AMO.7.13	but don’t prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house!”
AMO.7.14	Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a farmer of sycamore figs; 
AMO.7.15	and the 
AMO.7.16	Now therefore listen to the 
AMO.7.17	Therefore the 
AMO.8.1	Thus the Lord GOD showed me: behold, a basket of summer fruit.
AMO.8.2	He said, “Amos, what do you see?”
AMO.8.2	I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”
AMO.8.2	Then the 
AMO.8.2	“The end has come on my people Israel.
AMO.8.2	I will not again pass by them any more.
AMO.8.3	The songs of the temple will be wailing in that day,” says the Lord GOD.
AMO.8.3	“The dead bodies will be many. In every place they will throw them out with silence.
AMO.8.4	Hear this, you who desire to swallow up the needy,
AMO.8.4	and cause the poor of the land to fail,
AMO.8.5	Saying, ‘When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain?
AMO.8.5	And the Sabbath, that we may market wheat,
AMO.8.5	making the ephah
AMO.8.5	and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;
AMO.8.6	that we may buy the poor for silver,
AMO.8.6	and the needy for a pair of sandals,
AMO.8.6	and sell the sweepings with the wheat?’”
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.7	“Surely I will never forget any of their works.
AMO.8.8	Won’t the land tremble for this,
AMO.8.8	and everyone mourn who dwells in it?
AMO.8.8	Yes, it will rise up wholly like the River;
AMO.8.8	and it will be stirred up and sink again, like the River of Egypt.
AMO.8.9	It will happen in that day,” says the Lord GOD,
AMO.8.9	“that I will cause the sun to go down at noon,
AMO.8.9	and I will darken the earth in the clear day.
AMO.8.10	I will turn your feasts into mourning,
AMO.8.10	and all your songs into lamentation;
AMO.8.10	and I will make you wear sackcloth on all your bodies,
AMO.8.10	and baldness on every head.
AMO.8.10	I will make it like the mourning for an only son,
AMO.8.10	and its end like a bitter day.
AMO.8.11	Behold, the days come,” says the Lord GOD,
AMO.8.11	“that I will send a famine in the land,
AMO.8.11	not a famine of bread,
AMO.8.11	nor a thirst for water,
AMO.8.11	but of hearing the 
AMO.8.12	They will wander from sea to sea,
AMO.8.12	and from the north even to the east;
AMO.8.12	they will run back and forth to seek the 
AMO.8.12	and will not find it.
AMO.8.13	In that day the beautiful virgins
AMO.8.13	and the young men will faint for thirst.
AMO.8.14	Those who swear by the sin of Samaria,
AMO.8.14	and say, ‘As your god, Dan, lives;’
AMO.8.14	and, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives;’
AMO.8.14	they will fall, and never rise up again.”
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said, “Strike the tops of the pillars, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape. 
AMO.9.2	Though they dig into Sheol,
AMO.9.3	Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out from there; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them. 
AMO.9.4	Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good. 
AMO.9.5	For the Lord, the 
AMO.9.6	It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; the 
AMO.9.7	Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?” says the 
AMO.9.8	Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” says the 
AMO.9.9	“For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel amongst all the nations, as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth. 
AMO.9.10	All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, ‘Evil won’t overtake nor meet us.’ 
AMO.9.11	In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old; 
AMO.9.12	that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name,” says the 
AMO.9.13	“Behold, the days come,” says the 
AMO.9.13	“that the ploughman shall overtake the reaper,
AMO.9.13	and the one treading grapes him who sows seed;
AMO.9.13	and sweet wine will drip from the mountains,
AMO.9.13	and flow from the hills.
AMO.9.14	I will bring my people Israel back from captivity,
AMO.9.14	and they will rebuild the ruined cities, and inhabit them;
AMO.9.14	and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine from them.
AMO.9.14	They shall also make gardens,
AMO.9.14	and eat their fruit.
AMO.9.15	I will plant them on their land,
AMO.9.15	and they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them,”
AMO.9.15	says the 
OBA.1.1	The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord
OBA.1.2	Behold,
OBA.1.3	The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high, who says in his heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the ground?’ 
OBA.1.4	Though you mount on high as the eagle, and though your nest is set amongst the stars, I will bring you down from there,” says the 
OBA.1.5	“If thieves came to you, if robbers by night—oh, what disaster awaits you—wouldn’t they only steal until they had enough? If grape pickers came to you, wouldn’t they leave some gleaning grapes? 
OBA.1.6	How Esau will be ransacked! How his hidden treasures are sought out! 
OBA.1.7	All the men of your alliance have brought you on your way, even to the border. The men who were at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against you. Friends who eat your bread lay a snare under you. There is no understanding in him.”
OBA.1.8	“Won’t I in that day”, says the 
OBA.1.9	Your mighty men, Teman, will be dismayed, to the end that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter. 
OBA.1.10	For the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be cut off forever. 
OBA.1.11	In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you were like one of them. 
OBA.1.12	But don’t look down on your brother in the day of his disaster, and don’t rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction. Don’t speak proudly in the day of distress. 
OBA.1.13	Don’t enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity. Don’t look down on their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity. 
OBA.1.14	Don’t stand in the crossroads to cut off those of his who escape. Don’t deliver up those of his who remain in the day of distress. 
OBA.1.15	For the day of the 
OBA.1.16	For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so will all the nations drink continually. Yes, they will drink, swallow down, and will be as though they had not been. 
OBA.1.17	But in Mount Zion, there will be those who escape, and it will be holy. The house of Jacob will possess their possessions. 
OBA.1.18	The house of Jacob will be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. They will burn amongst them, and devour them. There will not be any remaining to the house of Esau.” Indeed, the 
OBA.1.19	Those of the South will possess the mountain of Esau, and those of the lowland, the Philistines. They will possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria. Benjamin will possess Gilead. 
OBA.1.20	The captives of this army of the children of Israel, who are amongst the Canaanites, will possess even to Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, will possess the cities of the Negev. 
OBA.1.21	Saviours will go up on Mount Zion to judge the mountains of Esau, and the kingdom will be the 
JON.1.1	Now the 
JON.1.2	“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach against it, for their wickedness has come up before me.”
JON.1.3	But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the 
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	Then the mariners were afraid, and every man cried to his god. They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone down into the innermost parts of the ship, and he was laying down, and was fast asleep. 
JON.1.6	So the ship master came to him, and said to him, “What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your God!
JON.1.7	They all said to each other, “Come! Let’s cast lots, that we may know who is responsible for this evil that is on us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. 
JON.1.8	Then they asked him, “Tell us, please, for whose cause this evil is on us. What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your country? Of what people are you?”
JON.1.9	He said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear the 
JON.1.10	Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, “What have you done?” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the 
JON.1.11	Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us?” For the sea grew more and more stormy. 
JON.1.12	He said to them, “Take me up, and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will be calm for you; for I know that because of me this great storm is on you.”
JON.1.13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not, for the sea grew more and more stormy against them. 
JON.1.14	Therefore they cried to the 
JON.1.15	So they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased its raging. 
JON.1.16	Then the men feared the 
JON.1.17	The 
JON.2.1	Then Jonah prayed to the 
JON.2.2	He said,
JON.2.2	“I called because of my affliction to the 
JON.2.2	He answered me.
JON.2.2	Out of the belly of Sheol
JON.2.2	You heard my voice.
JON.2.3	For you threw me into the depths,
JON.2.3	in the heart of the seas.
JON.2.3	The flood was all around me.
JON.2.3	All your waves and your billows passed over me.
JON.2.4	I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight;
JON.2.4	yet I will look again towards your holy temple.’
JON.2.5	The waters surrounded me,
JON.2.5	even to the soul.
JON.2.5	The deep was around me.
JON.2.5	The weeds were wrapped around my head.
JON.2.6	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains.
JON.2.6	The earth barred me in forever:
JON.2.6	yet have you brought up my life from the pit, 
JON.2.7	“When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the 
JON.2.7	My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.
JON.2.8	Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
JON.2.9	But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving.
JON.2.9	I will pay that which I have vowed.
JON.2.9	Salvation belongs to the 
JON.2.10	Then The 
JON.3.1	The 
JON.3.2	“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the message that I give you.”
JON.3.3	So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the 
JON.3.4	Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried out, and said, “In forty days, Nineveh will be overthrown!”
JON.3.5	The people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from their greatest even to their least. 
JON.3.6	The news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and took off his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 
JON.3.7	He made a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, “Let neither man nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water; 
JON.3.8	but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them cry mightily to God. Yes, let them turn everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands. 
JON.3.9	Who knows whether God will not turn and relent, and turn away from his fierce anger, so that we might not perish?”
JON.3.10	God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. God relented of the disaster which he said he would do to them, and he didn’t do it.
JON.4.1	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. 
JON.4.2	He prayed to the 
JON.4.3	Therefore now, 
JON.4.4	The 
JON.4.5	Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made himself a booth, and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would become of the city. 
JON.4.6	The 
JON.4.7	But God prepared a worm at dawn the next day, and it chewed on the vine, so that it withered. 
JON.4.8	When the sun arose, God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah’s head, so that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.”
JON.4.9	God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?”
JON.4.9	He said, “I am right to be angry, even to death.”
JON.4.10	The 
JON.4.11	Shouldn’t I be concerned for Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who can’t discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much livestock?”

MIC.1.6	Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field,
MIC.1.6	like places for planting vineyards;
MIC.1.6	and I will pour down its stones into the valley,
MIC.1.6	and I will uncover its foundations.
MIC.1.7	All her idols will be beaten to pieces,
MIC.1.7	and all her temple gifts will be burnt with fire,
MIC.1.7	and all her images I will destroy;
MIC.1.7	for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them,
MIC.1.7	and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.”
MIC.1.8	For this I will lament and wail;
MIC.1.8	I will go stripped and naked;
MIC.1.8	I will howl like the jackals,
MIC.1.8	and moan like the daughters of owls.
MIC.1.9	For her wounds are incurable;
MIC.1.9	for it has come even to Judah.
MIC.1.9	It reaches to the gate of my people,
MIC.1.9	even to Jerusalem.
MIC.1.10	Don’t tell it in Gath.
MIC.1.10	Don’t weep at all.
MIC.1.10	At Beth Ophrah
MIC.1.11	Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.
MIC.1.11	The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out.
MIC.1.11	The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection.
MIC.1.12	For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good,
MIC.1.12	because evil has come down from the 
MIC.1.13	Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish.
MIC.1.13	She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion;
MIC.1.13	For the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
MIC.1.14	Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath.
MIC.1.14	The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel.
MIC.1.15	I will yet bring to you, inhabitant of Mareshah, him who will possess you.
MIC.1.15	He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam.
MIC.1.16	Shave your heads,
MIC.1.16	and cut off your hair for the children of your delight.
MIC.1.16	Enlarge your baldness like the vulture;
MIC.1.16	for they have gone into captivity from you!
MIC.2.1	Woe to those who devise iniquity
MIC.2.1	and work evil on their beds!
MIC.2.1	When the morning is light, they practise it,
MIC.2.1	because it is in the power of their hand.
MIC.2.2	They covet fields, and seize them;
MIC.2.2	and houses, and take them away:
MIC.2.2	and they oppress a man and his house,
MIC.2.2	even a man and his heritage.
MIC.2.3	Therefore the 
MIC.2.3	“Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster,
MIC.2.3	from which you will not remove your necks,
MIC.2.3	neither will you walk haughtily;
MIC.2.3	for it is an evil time.
MIC.2.4	In that day they will take up a parable against you,
MIC.2.4	and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying,
MIC.2.4	‘We are utterly ruined!
MIC.2.4	My people’s possession is divided up.
MIC.2.4	Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’”
MIC.2.5	Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in the 
MIC.2.6	“Don’t prophesy!”
MIC.2.6	They prophesy.
MIC.2.6	“Don’t prophesy about these things.
MIC.2.6	Disgrace won’t overtake us.”
MIC.2.7	Shall it be said, O house of Jacob:
MIC.2.7	“Is the 
MIC.2.7	Are these his doings?
MIC.2.7	Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?”
MIC.2.8	But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.
MIC.2.8	You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.
MIC.2.9	You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;
MIC.2.9	from their young children you take away my blessing forever.
MIC.2.10	Arise, and depart!
MIC.2.10	For this is not your resting place,
MIC.2.10	because of uncleanness that destroys,
MIC.2.10	even with a grievous destruction.
MIC.2.11	If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies:
MIC.2.11	“I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink;”
MIC.2.11	he would be the prophet of this people.
MIC.2.12	I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you;
MIC.2.12	I will surely gather the remnant of Israel;
MIC.2.12	I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,
MIC.2.12	as a flock in the middle of their pasture;
MIC.2.12	they will swarm with people.
MIC.2.13	He who breaks open the way goes up before them.
MIC.2.13	They break through the gate, and go out.
MIC.2.13	And their king passes on before them,
MIC.2.13	with the 
MIC.3.1	I said,
MIC.3.1	“Please listen, you heads of Jacob,
MIC.3.1	and rulers of the house of Israel:
MIC.3.1	Isn’t it for you to know justice?
MIC.3.2	You who hate the good,
MIC.3.2	and love the evil;
MIC.3.2	who tear off their skin,
MIC.3.2	and their flesh from off their bones;
MIC.3.3	who also eat the flesh of my people,
MIC.3.3	and peel their skin from off them,
MIC.3.3	and break their bones,
MIC.3.3	and chop them in pieces, as for the pot,
MIC.3.3	and as meat within the cauldron.
MIC.3.4	Then they will cry to the 
MIC.3.4	but he will not answer them.
MIC.3.4	Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time,
MIC.3.4	because they made their deeds evil.”
MIC.3.5	The 
MIC.3.6	“Therefore night is over you, with no vision,
MIC.3.6	and it is dark to you, that you may not divine;
MIC.3.6	and the sun will go down on the prophets,
MIC.3.6	and the day will be black over them.
MIC.3.7	The seers shall be disappointed,
MIC.3.7	and the diviners confounded.
MIC.3.7	Yes, they shall all cover their lips;
MIC.3.7	for there is no answer from God.”
MIC.3.8	But as for me, I am full of power by the 
MIC.3.8	and of judgement, and of might,
MIC.3.8	to declare to Jacob his disobedience,
MIC.3.8	and to Israel his sin.
MIC.3.9	Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,
MIC.3.9	and rulers of the house of Israel,
MIC.3.9	who abhor justice,
MIC.3.9	and pervert all equity.
MIC.3.10	They build up Zion with blood,
MIC.3.10	and Jerusalem with iniquity.
MIC.3.11	Her leaders judge for bribes,
MIC.3.11	and her priests teach for a price,
MIC.3.11	and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money:
MIC.3.11	yet they lean on the 
MIC.3.11	“Isn’t the 
MIC.3.11	No disaster will come on us.”
MIC.3.12	Therefore Zion for your sake will be ploughed like a field,
MIC.3.12	and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble,
MIC.3.12	and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest.
MIC.4.1	But in the latter days,
MIC.4.1	it will happen that the mountain of the 
MIC.4.1	and it will be exalted above the hills;
MIC.4.1	and peoples will stream to it.
MIC.4.2	Many nations will go and say,
MIC.4.2	“Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of the 
MIC.4.2	and to the house of the God of Jacob;
MIC.4.2	and he will teach us of his ways,
MIC.4.2	and we will walk in his paths.”
MIC.4.2	For the law will go out of Zion,
MIC.4.2	and the 
MIC.4.3	and he will judge between many peoples,
MIC.4.3	and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.
MIC.4.3	They will beat their swords into ploughshares,
MIC.4.3	and their spears into pruning hooks.
MIC.4.3	Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
MIC.4.3	neither will they learn war any more.
MIC.4.4	But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;
MIC.4.4	and no one will make them afraid:
MIC.4.4	For the mouth of the 
MIC.4.5	Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods;
MIC.4.5	but we will walk in the name of the 
MIC.4.6	“In that day,” says the 
MIC.4.6	“I will assemble that which is lame,
MIC.4.6	and I will gather that which is driven away,
MIC.4.6	and that which I have afflicted;
MIC.4.7	and I will make that which was lame a remnant,
MIC.4.7	and that which was cast far off a strong nation:
MIC.4.7	and the 
MIC.4.8	You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,
MIC.4.8	to you it will come,
MIC.4.8	yes, the former dominion will come,
MIC.4.8	the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
MIC.4.9	Now why do you cry out aloud?
MIC.4.9	Is there no king in you?
MIC.4.9	Has your counsellor perished,
MIC.4.9	that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?
MIC.4.10	Be in pain, and labour to give birth, daughter of Zion,
MIC.4.10	like a woman in travail;
MIC.4.10	for now you will go out of the city,
MIC.4.10	and will dwell in the field,
MIC.4.10	and will come even to Babylon.
MIC.4.10	There you will be rescued.
MIC.4.10	There the 
MIC.4.11	Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,
MIC.4.11	“Let her be defiled,
MIC.4.11	and let our eye gloat over Zion.”
MIC.4.12	But they don’t know the thoughts of the 
MIC.4.12	neither do they understand his counsel;
MIC.4.12	for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.
MIC.4.13	Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion;
MIC.4.13	for I will make your horn iron,
MIC.4.13	and I will make your hoofs bronze;
MIC.4.13	and you will beat in pieces many peoples:
MIC.4.13	and I will devote their gain to the 
MIC.4.13	and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.
MIC.5.1	Now you shall gather yourself in troops,
MIC.5.1	daughter of troops.
MIC.5.1	He has laid siege against us.
MIC.5.1	They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.
MIC.5.2	But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
MIC.5.2	being small amongst the clans of Judah,
MIC.5.2	out of you one will come out to me that is to be ruler in Israel;
MIC.5.2	whose goings out are from of old, from ancient times.
MIC.5.3	Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labour gives birth.
MIC.5.3	Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel.
MIC.5.4	He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of the 
MIC.5.4	in the majesty of the name of the 
MIC.5.4	and they will live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth.
MIC.5.5	He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land,
MIC.5.5	and when he marches through our fortresses,
MIC.5.5	then we will raise against him seven shepherds,
MIC.5.5	and eight leaders of men.
MIC.5.6	They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,
MIC.5.6	and the land of Nimrod in its gates.
MIC.5.6	He will deliver us from the Assyrian,
MIC.5.6	when he invades our land,
MIC.5.6	and when he marches within our border.
MIC.5.7	The remnant of Jacob will be amongst many peoples,
MIC.5.7	like dew from the 
MIC.5.7	like showers on the grass,
MIC.5.7	that don’t wait for man,
MIC.5.7	nor wait for the sons of men.
MIC.5.8	The remnant of Jacob will be amongst the nations,
MIC.5.8	amongst many peoples,
MIC.5.8	like a lion amongst the animals of the forest,
MIC.5.8	like a young lion amongst the flocks of sheep;
MIC.5.8	who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces,
MIC.5.8	and there is no one to deliver.
MIC.5.9	Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries,
MIC.5.9	and let all of your enemies be cut off.
MIC.5.10	“It will happen in that day”, says the 
MIC.5.10	“that I will cut off your horses out from amongst you,
MIC.5.10	and will destroy your chariots.
MIC.5.11	I will cut off the cities of your land,
MIC.5.11	and will tear down all your strongholds.
MIC.5.12	I will destroy witchcraft from your hand;
MIC.5.12	and you shall have no soothsayers.
MIC.5.13	I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out from amongst you;
MIC.5.13	and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.
MIC.5.14	I will uproot your Asherah poles out from amongst you;
MIC.5.14	and I will destroy your cities.
MIC.5.15	I will execute vengeance in anger,
MIC.5.15	and wrath on the nations that didn’t listen.”
MIC.6.1	Listen now to what the 
MIC.6.1	“Arise, plead your case before the mountains,
MIC.6.1	and let the hills hear what you have to say.
MIC.6.2	Hear, you mountains, the 
MIC.6.2	and you enduring foundations of the earth;
MIC.6.2	for the 
MIC.6.2	and he will contend with Israel.
MIC.6.3	My people, what have I done to you?
MIC.6.3	How have I burdened you?
MIC.6.3	Answer me!
MIC.6.4	For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,
MIC.6.4	and redeemed you out of the house of bondage.
MIC.6.4	I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
MIC.6.5	My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised,
MIC.6.5	and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal,
MIC.6.5	that you may know the righteous acts of the 
MIC.6.6	How shall I come before the 
MIC.6.6	and bow myself before the exalted God?
MIC.6.6	Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
MIC.6.6	with calves a year old?
MIC.6.7	Will the 
MIC.6.7	With tens of thousands of rivers of oil?
MIC.6.7	Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience?
MIC.6.7	The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
MIC.6.8	He has shown you, O man, what is good.
MIC.6.8	What does the 
MIC.6.8	to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?
MIC.6.9	The 
MIC.6.9	and wisdom sees your name:
MIC.6.9	“Listen to the rod,
MIC.6.9	and he who appointed it.
MIC.6.10	Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,
MIC.6.10	and a short ephah
MIC.6.11	Shall I be pure with dishonest scales,
MIC.6.11	and with a bag of deceitful weights?
MIC.6.12	Her rich men are full of violence,
MIC.6.12	her inhabitants speak lies,
MIC.6.12	and their tongue is deceitful in their speech.
MIC.6.13	Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound.
MIC.6.13	I have made you desolate because of your sins.
MIC.6.14	You shall eat, but not be satisfied.
MIC.6.14	Your humiliation will be within you.
MIC.6.14	You will store up, but not save;
MIC.6.14	and that which you save I will give up to the sword.
MIC.6.15	You will sow, but won’t reap.
MIC.6.15	You will tread the olives, but won’t anoint yourself with oil;
MIC.6.15	and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine.
MIC.6.16	For the statutes of Omri are kept,
MIC.6.16	and all the works of Ahab’s house.
MIC.6.16	You walk in their counsels,
MIC.6.16	that I may make you a ruin,
MIC.6.16	and her inhabitants a hissing;
MIC.6.16	And you will bear the reproach of my people.”
MIC.7.1	Misery is mine!
MIC.7.1	Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard:
MIC.7.1	There is no cluster of grapes to eat.
MIC.7.1	My soul desires to eat the early fig.
MIC.7.2	The godly man has perished out of the earth,
MIC.7.2	and there is no one upright amongst men.
MIC.7.2	They all lie in wait for blood;
MIC.7.2	every man hunts his brother with a net.
MIC.7.3	Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.
MIC.7.3	The ruler and judge ask for a bribe;
MIC.7.3	and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul.
MIC.7.3	Thus they conspire together.
MIC.7.4	The best of them is like a brier.
MIC.7.4	The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.
MIC.7.4	The day of your watchmen,
MIC.7.4	even your visitation, has come;
MIC.7.4	now is the time of their confusion.
MIC.7.5	Don’t trust in a neighbour.
MIC.7.5	Don’t put confidence in a friend.
MIC.7.5	With the woman lying in your embrace,
MIC.7.5	be careful of the words of your mouth!
MIC.7.6	For the son dishonours the father,
MIC.7.6	the daughter rises up against her mother,
MIC.7.6	the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
MIC.7.6	a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.
MIC.7.7	But as for me, I will look to the 
MIC.7.7	I will wait for the God of my salvation.
MIC.7.7	My God will hear me.
MIC.7.8	Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy.
MIC.7.8	When I fall, I will arise.
MIC.7.8	When I sit in darkness, the 
MIC.7.9	I will bear the indignation of the 
MIC.7.9	because I have sinned against him,
MIC.7.9	until he pleads my case, and executes judgement for me.
MIC.7.9	He will bring me out to the light.
MIC.7.9	I will see his righteousness.
MIC.7.10	Then my enemy will see it,
MIC.7.10	and shame will cover her who said to me,
MIC.7.10	where is the 
MIC.7.10	Then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame.
MIC.7.10	Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.
MIC.7.11	A day to build your walls!
MIC.7.11	In that day, he will extend your boundary.
MIC.7.12	In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
MIC.7.12	and from Egypt even to the River,
MIC.7.12	and from sea to sea,
MIC.7.12	and mountain to mountain.
MIC.7.13	Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,
MIC.7.13	for the fruit of their doings.
MIC.7.14	Shepherd your people with your staff,
MIC.7.14	the flock of your heritage,
MIC.7.14	who dwell by themselves in a forest,
MIC.7.14	in the middle of fertile pasture land, let them feed;
MIC.7.14	in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
MIC.7.15	“As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt,
MIC.7.15	I will show them marvellous things.”
MIC.7.16	The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.
MIC.7.16	They will lay their hand on their mouth.
MIC.7.16	Their ears will be deaf.
MIC.7.17	They will lick the dust like a serpent.
MIC.7.17	Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens.
MIC.7.17	They will come with fear to the 
MIC.7.17	and will be afraid because of you.
MIC.7.18	Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity,
MIC.7.18	and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?
MIC.7.18	He doesn’t retain his anger forever,
MIC.7.18	because he delights in loving kindness.
MIC.7.19	He will again have compassion on us.
MIC.7.19	He will tread our iniquities under foot;
MIC.7.19	and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
MIC.7.20	You will give truth to Jacob,
MIC.7.20	and mercy to Abraham,
MIC.7.20	as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
NAM.1.1	A revelation about Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. 
NAM.1.2	The 
NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.4	He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan languishes, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languishes. 
NAM.1.5	The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the world, and all who dwell in it. 
NAM.1.6	Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him. 
NAM.1.7	The 
NAM.1.8	But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness. 
NAM.1.9	What do you plot against the 
NAM.1.10	For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly like dry stubble. 
NAM.1.11	One has gone out of you who devises evil against the 
NAM.1.12	The 
NAM.1.13	Now I will break his yoke from off you, and will burst your bonds apart.” 
NAM.1.14	The 
NAM.1.15	Behold,
NAM.2.1	He who dashes in pieces has come up against you. Keep the fortress! Watch the way! Strengthen your waist! Fortify your power mightily! 
NAM.2.2	For the 
NAM.2.3	The shield of his mighty men is made red. The valiant men are in scarlet. The chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished. 
NAM.2.4	The chariots rage in the streets. They rush back and forth in the wide ways. Their appearance is like torches. They run like the lightnings. 
NAM.2.5	He summons his picked troops. They stumble on their way. They dash to its wall, and the protective shield is put in place. 
NAM.2.6	The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved. 
NAM.2.7	It is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her servants moan as with the voice of doves, beating on their breasts. 
NAM.2.8	But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water, yet they flee away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one looks back. 
NAM.2.9	Take the plunder of silver. Take the plunder of gold, for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture. 
NAM.2.10	She is empty, void, and waste. The heart melts, the knees knock together, their bodies and faces have grown pale. 
NAM.2.11	Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, the lion’s cubs, and no one made them afraid? 
NAM.2.12	The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with the kill, and his dens with prey. 
NAM.2.13	“Behold, I am against you,” says the 
NAM.3.1	Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and robbery. The prey doesn’t depart. 
NAM.3.2	The noise of the whip, the noise of the rattling of wheels, prancing horses, and bounding chariots, 
NAM.3.3	the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies. They stumble on their bodies, 
NAM.3.4	because of the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring prostitute, the mistress of witchcraft, who sells nations through her prostitution, and families through her witchcraft. 
NAM.3.5	“Behold, I am against you,” says the 
NAM.3.6	I will throw abominable filth on you, and make you vile, and will set you a spectacle. 
NAM.3.7	It will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you, and say, ‘Nineveh is laid waste! Who will mourn for her?’ Where will I seek comforters for you?”
NAM.3.8	Are you better than No-Amon,
NAM.3.9	Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength. Put and Libya were her helpers. 
NAM.3.10	Yet was she carried away. She went into captivity. Her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets, and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains. 
NAM.3.11	You also will be drunken. You will be hidden. You also will seek a stronghold because of the enemy. 
NAM.3.12	All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first-ripe figs: if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater. 
NAM.3.13	Behold, your troops amongst you are women. The gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies. The fire has devoured your bars. 
NAM.3.14	Draw water for the siege. Strengthen your fortresses. Go into the clay, and tread the mortar. Make the brick kiln strong. 
NAM.3.15	There the fire will devour you. The sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the grasshopper. Multiply like grasshoppers. Multiply like the locust. 
NAM.3.16	You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the skies. The grasshopper strips, and flees away. 
NAM.3.17	Your guards are like the locusts, and your officials like the swarms of locusts, which settle on the walls on a cold day, but when the sun appears, they flee away, and their place is not known where they are. 
NAM.3.18	Your shepherds slumber, king of Assyria. Your nobles lie down. Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to gather them. 
NAM.3.19	There is no healing your wound, for your injury is fatal. All who hear the report of you clap their hands over you; for who hasn’t felt your endless cruelty?
HAB.1.1	The revelation which Habakkuk the prophet saw. 
HAB.1.2	LORD,
HAB.1.3	Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perversity? For destruction and violence are before me. There is strife, and contention rises up. 
HAB.1.4	Therefore the law is paralysed, and justice never prevails; for the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice comes out perverted.
HAB.1.5	“Look amongst the nations, watch, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you. 
HAB.1.6	For, behold,
HAB.1.7	They are feared and dreaded. Their judgement and their dignity proceed from themselves. 
HAB.1.8	Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. Their horsemen press proudly on. Yes, their horsemen come from afar. They fly as an eagle that hurries to devour. 
HAB.1.9	All of them come for violence. Their hordes face the desert. He gathers prisoners like sand. 
HAB.1.10	Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a derision to him. He laughs at every stronghold, for he builds up an earthen ramp, and takes it. 
HAB.1.11	Then he sweeps by like the wind, and goes on. He is indeed guilty, whose strength is his god.”
HAB.1.12	Aren’t you from everlasting, 
HAB.1.13	You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he, 
HAB.1.14	and make men like the fish of the sea, like the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? 
HAB.1.15	He takes up all of them with the hook. He catches them in his net, and gathers them in his dragnet. Therefore he rejoices and is glad. 
HAB.1.16	Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his dragnet, because by them his life is luxurious, and his food is good. 
HAB.1.17	Will he therefore continually empty his net, and kill the nations without mercy?
HAB.2.1	I will stand at my watch, and set myself on the ramparts, and will look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.
HAB.2.2	The 
HAB.2.3	For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hurries towards the end, and won’t prove false. Though it takes time, wait for it; because it will surely come. It won’t delay. 
HAB.2.4	Behold, his soul is puffed up. It is not upright in him, but the righteous will live by his faith. 
HAB.2.5	Yes, moreover, wine is treacherous: an arrogant man who doesn’t stay at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol;
HAB.2.6	Won’t all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, ‘Woe to him who increases that which is not his, and who enriches himself by extortion! How long?’ 
HAB.2.7	Won’t your debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who make you tremble, and you will be their victim? 
HAB.2.8	Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it. 
HAB.2.9	Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil! 
HAB.2.10	You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul. 
HAB.2.11	For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it. 
HAB.2.12	Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity! 
HAB.2.13	Behold, isn’t it of the 
HAB.2.14	For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the 
HAB.2.15	“Woe to him who gives his neighbour drink, pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze at their naked bodies! 
HAB.2.16	You are filled with shame, and not glory. You will also drink, and be exposed! The cup of the 
HAB.2.17	For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the animals, which made them afraid, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to every city and to those who dwell in them.
HAB.2.18	“What value does the engraved image have, that its maker has engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols? 
HAB.2.19	Woe to him who says to the wood, ‘Awake!’ or to the mute stone, ‘Arise!’ Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all within it. 
HAB.2.20	But the 
HAB.3.1	A prayer of Habakkuk, the prophet, set to victorious music.
HAB.3.2	, I have heard of your fame.
HAB.3.2	I stand in awe of your deeds, 
HAB.3.2	Renew your work in the middle of the years.
HAB.3.2	In the middle of the years make it known.
HAB.3.2	In wrath, you remember mercy.
HAB.3.3	God came from Teman,
HAB.3.3	the Holy One from Mount Paran. 
HAB.3.3	His glory covered the heavens,
HAB.3.3	and his praise filled the earth.
HAB.3.4	His splendour is like the sunrise.
HAB.3.4	Rays shine from his hand, where his power is hidden.
HAB.3.5	Plague went before him,
HAB.3.5	and pestilence followed his feet.
HAB.3.6	He stood, and shook the earth.
HAB.3.6	He looked, and made the nations tremble.
HAB.3.6	The ancient mountains were crumbled.
HAB.3.6	The age-old hills collapsed.
HAB.3.6	His ways are eternal.
HAB.3.7	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction.
HAB.3.7	The dwellings of the land of Midian trembled.
HAB.3.8	Was the 
HAB.3.8	Was your anger against the rivers,
HAB.3.8	or your wrath against the sea,
HAB.3.8	that you rode on your horses,
HAB.3.8	on your chariots of salvation?
HAB.3.9	You uncovered your bow.
HAB.3.9	You called for your sworn arrows. 
HAB.3.9	You split the earth with rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains saw you, and were afraid.
HAB.3.10	The storm of waters passed by.
HAB.3.10	The deep roared and lifted up its hands on high.
HAB.3.11	The sun and moon stood still in the sky,
HAB.3.11	at the light of your arrows as they went,
HAB.3.11	at the shining of your glittering spear.
HAB.3.12	You marched through the land in wrath.
HAB.3.12	You threshed the nations in anger.
HAB.3.13	You went out for the salvation of your people,
HAB.3.13	for the salvation of your anointed.
HAB.3.13	You crushed the head of the land of wickedness.
HAB.3.13	You stripped them head to foot. 
HAB.3.14	You pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears.
HAB.3.14	They came as a whirlwind to scatter me,
HAB.3.14	gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret.
HAB.3.15	You trampled the sea with your horses,
HAB.3.15	churning mighty waters.
HAB.3.16	I heard, and my body trembled.
HAB.3.16	My lips quivered at the voice.
HAB.3.16	Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place,
HAB.3.16	because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,
HAB.3.16	for the coming up of the people who invade us.
HAB.3.17	For though the fig tree doesn’t flourish,
HAB.3.17	nor fruit be in the vines;
HAB.3.17	the labour of the olive fails,
HAB.3.17	the fields yield no food;
HAB.3.17	the flocks are cut off from the fold,
HAB.3.17	and there is no herd in the stalls:
HAB.3.18	yet I will rejoice in the 
HAB.3.18	I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!
HAB.3.19	The 
HAB.3.19	He makes my feet like deer’s feet,
HAB.3.19	and enables me to go in high places.
HAB.3.19	For the music director, on my stringed instruments.
ZEP.1.1	The 
ZEP.1.2	I will utterly sweep away everything from the surface of the earth, says the 
ZEP.1.3	I will sweep away man and animal. I will sweep away the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and the heaps of rubble with the wicked. I will cut off man from the surface of the earth, says the 
ZEP.1.4	I will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place: the name of the idolatrous and pagan priests, 
ZEP.1.5	those who worship the army of the sky on the housetops, those who worship and swear by the 
ZEP.1.6	those who have turned back from following the 
ZEP.1.7	Be silent at the presence of the Lord
ZEP.1.8	It will happen in the day of the 
ZEP.1.9	In that day, I will punish all those who leap over the threshold, who fill their master’s house with violence and deceit. 
ZEP.1.10	In that day, says the 
ZEP.1.11	Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan are undone! All those who were loaded with silver are cut off. 
ZEP.1.12	It will happen at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are settled on their dregs, who say in their heart, “The 
ZEP.1.13	Their wealth will become a plunder, and their houses a desolation. Yes, they will build houses, but won’t inhabit them. They will plant vineyards, but won’t drink their wine. 
ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.15	That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness, 
ZEP.1.16	a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements. 
ZEP.1.17	I will bring distress on men, that they will walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the 
ZEP.1.18	Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them in the day of the 
ZEP.2.1	Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together, you nation that has no shame, 
ZEP.2.2	before the appointed time when the day passes as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the 
ZEP.2.3	Seek the 
ZEP.2.4	For Gaza will be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation. They will drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron will be rooted up. 
ZEP.2.5	Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The 
ZEP.2.6	The sea coast will be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks. 
ZEP.2.7	The coast will be for the remnant of the house of Judah. They will find pasture. In the houses of Ashkelon, they will lie down in the evening, for the 
ZEP.2.8	I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the insults of the children of Ammon, with which they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border. 
ZEP.2.9	Therefore as I live, says the 
ZEP.2.10	This they will have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.12	You Cushites also, you will be killed by my sword. 
ZEP.2.13	He will stretch out his hand against the north, destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, as dry as the wilderness. 
ZEP.2.14	Herds will lie down in the middle of her, all the animals of the nations. Both the pelican and the porcupine will lodge in its capitals. Their calls will echo through the windows. Desolation will be in the thresholds, for he has laid bare the cedar beams. 
ZEP.2.15	This is the joyous city that lived carelessly, that said in her heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me.” How she has become a desolation, a place for animals to lie down in! Everyone who passes by her will hiss, and shake their fists.
ZEP.3.1	Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city! 
ZEP.3.2	She didn’t obey the voice. She didn’t receive correction. She didn’t trust in the 
ZEP.3.3	Her princes within her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day. 
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law. 
ZEP.3.5	The 
ZEP.3.6	I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant. 
ZEP.3.7	I said, “Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won’t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.” But they rose early and corrupted all their doings. 
ZEP.3.8	“Therefore wait for me”, says the 
ZEP.3.9	For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on the 
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshippers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering. 
ZEP.3.11	In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out from amongst you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be arrogant in my holy mountain. 
ZEP.3.12	But I will leave amongst you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in the 
ZEP.3.13	The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.”
ZEP.3.14	Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem. 
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.16	In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, “Don’t be afraid, Zion. Don’t let your hands be weak.” 
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.18	I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you. 
ZEP.3.19	Behold,
ZEP.3.20	At that time I will bring you in, and at that time I will gather you; for I will give you honour and praise amongst all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the 
HAG.1.1	In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the 
HAG.1.2	“This is what the 
HAG.1.3	Then the 
HAG.1.4	“Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your panelled houses, while this house lies waste? 
HAG.1.5	Now therefore this is what the 
HAG.1.6	You have sown much, and bring in little. You eat, but you don’t have enough. You drink, but you aren’t filled with drink. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes in it.”
HAG.1.7	This is what the 
HAG.1.8	Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house. I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified,” says the 
HAG.1.9	“You looked for much, and, behold,
HAG.1.10	Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit. 
HAG.1.11	I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on that which the ground produces, on men, on livestock, and on all the labour of the hands.”
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the 
HAG.1.13	Then Haggai, the 
HAG.1.14	The 
HAG.1.15	in the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
HAG.2.1	In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, the 
HAG.2.2	“Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 
HAG.2.3	‘Who is left amongst you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn’t it in your eyes as nothing? 
HAG.2.4	Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ says the 
HAG.2.5	This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived amongst you. ‘Don’t be afraid.’ 
HAG.2.6	For this is what the 
HAG.2.7	and I will shake all nations. The precious things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says the 
HAG.2.8	The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,’ says the 
HAG.2.9	‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says the 
HAG.2.10	In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the 
HAG.2.11	“The 
HAG.2.12	‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?’”
HAG.2.12	The priests answered, “No.”
HAG.2.13	Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?”
HAG.2.13	The priests answered, “It will be unclean.”
HAG.2.14	Then Haggai answered, “‘So is this people, and so is this nation before me,’ says the 
HAG.2.15	Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in the 
HAG.2.16	Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty. 
HAG.2.17	I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says the 
HAG.2.18	‘Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of the 
HAG.2.19	Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven’t produced. From today I will bless you.’”
HAG.2.20	The 
HAG.2.21	“Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, ‘I will shake the heavens and the earth. 
HAG.2.22	I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his brother. 
HAG.2.23	In that day, says the 
ZEC.1.1	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the 
ZEC.1.2	“The 
ZEC.1.3	Therefore tell them: the 
ZEC.1.4	Don’t you be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying: The 
ZEC.1.5	Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? 
ZEC.1.6	But my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, didn’t they overtake your fathers?
ZEC.1.6	“Then they repented and said, ‘Just as the 
ZEC.1.7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the 
ZEC.1.8	“I had a vision in the night, and behold,
ZEC.1.9	Then I asked, ‘My lord, what are these?’”
ZEC.1.9	The angel who talked with me said to me, “I will show you what these are.”
ZEC.1.10	The man who stood amongst the myrtle trees answered, “They are the ones the 
ZEC.1.11	They reported to the 
ZEC.1.12	Then the 
ZEC.1.13	The 
ZEC.1.14	So the angel who talked with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘The 
ZEC.1.15	I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, but they added to the calamity.” 
ZEC.1.16	Therefore the 
ZEC.1.17	“Proclaim further, saying, ‘The 
ZEC.1.18	I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four horns. 
ZEC.1.19	I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these?”
ZEC.1.19	He answered me, “These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
ZEC.1.20	The 
ZEC.1.21	Then I asked, “What are these coming to do?”
ZEC.1.21	He said, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head; but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.”
ZEC.2.1	I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
ZEC.2.2	Then I asked, “Where are you going?”
ZEC.2.2	He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.”
ZEC.2.3	Behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him, 
ZEC.2.4	and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it. 
ZEC.2.5	For I,’ says the 
ZEC.2.6	Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says the 
ZEC.2.7	‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.’ 
ZEC.2.8	For the 
ZEC.2.9	For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a plunder to those who served them; and you will know that the 
ZEC.2.10	Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come, and I will dwell within you,’ says the 
ZEC.2.11	Many nations shall join themselves to the 
ZEC.2.12	The 
ZEC.2.13	Be silent, all flesh, before the 
ZEC.3.1	He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the 
ZEC.3.2	The 
ZEC.3.3	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel. 
ZEC.3.4	He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take the filthy garments off him.” To him he said, “Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.”
ZEC.3.5	I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.”
ZEC.3.5	So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and the 
ZEC.3.6	The 
ZEC.3.7	“The 
ZEC.3.8	Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring out my servant, the Branch. 
ZEC.3.9	For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave its engraving,’ says the 
ZEC.3.10	In that day,’ says the 
ZEC.4.1	The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep. 
ZEC.4.2	He said to me, “What do you see?”
ZEC.4.2	I said, “I have seen, and behold, a lamp stand all of gold, with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it; 
ZEC.4.3	and two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it.”
ZEC.4.4	I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, “What are these, my lord?”
ZEC.4.5	Then the angel who talked with me answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?”
ZEC.4.5	I said, “No, my lord.”
ZEC.4.6	Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, “This is the 
ZEC.4.7	Who are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you are a plain; and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of ‘Grace, grace, to it!’”
ZEC.4.8	Moreover the 
ZEC.4.9	“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it; and you will know that the 
ZEC.4.10	Indeed, who despises the day of small things? For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are the 
ZEC.4.11	Then I asked him, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lamp stand and on the left side of it?”
ZEC.4.12	I asked him the second time, “What are these two olive branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that pour the golden oil out of themselves?”
ZEC.4.13	He answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?”
ZEC.4.13	I said, “No, my lord.”
ZEC.4.14	Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord
ZEC.5.1	Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a flying scroll. 
ZEC.5.2	He said to me, “What do you see?”
ZEC.5.2	I answered, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits,
ZEC.5.3	Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the surface of the whole land; for everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it on the one side; and everyone who swears falsely shall be cut off according to it on the other side. 
ZEC.5.4	I will cause it to go out,” says the 
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel who talked with me came forward, and said to me, “Lift up now your eyes, and see what this is that is appearing.”
ZEC.5.6	I said, “What is it?”
ZEC.5.6	He said, “This is the ephah
ZEC.5.7	(and behold, a talent
ZEC.5.8	He said, “This is Wickedness;” and he threw her down into the middle of the ephah basket; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth.
ZEC.5.9	Then I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, there were two women, and the wind was in their wings. Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah basket between earth and the sky. 
ZEC.5.10	Then I said to the angel who talked with me, “Where are these carrying the ephah basket?”
ZEC.5.11	He said to me, “To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place.”
ZEC.6.1	Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze. 
ZEC.6.2	In the first chariot were red horses; in the second chariot black horses; 
ZEC.6.3	in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot dappled horses, all of them powerful. 
ZEC.6.4	Then I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
ZEC.6.5	The angel answered me, “These are the four winds of the sky, which go out from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 
ZEC.6.6	The one with the black horses goes out towards the north country; and the white went out after them; and the dappled went out towards the south country.” 
ZEC.6.7	The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth: and he said, “Go around and through the earth!” So they walked back and forth through the earth.
ZEC.6.8	Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “Behold, those who go towards the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.”
ZEC.6.9	The 
ZEC.6.10	“Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon. 
ZEC.6.11	Yes, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest; 
ZEC.6.12	and speak to him, saying, ‘The 
ZEC.6.13	even he shall build the 
ZEC.6.14	The crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the 
ZEC.6.15	Those who are far off shall come and build in the 
ZEC.7.1	In the fourth year of king Darius, the 
ZEC.7.2	The people of Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem Melech, and their men, to entreat the 
ZEC.7.3	and to speak to the priests of the house of the 
ZEC.7.4	Then the word of the 
ZEC.7.5	“Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month for these seventy years, did you at all fast to me, really to me? 
ZEC.7.6	When you eat, and when you drink, don’t you eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? 
ZEC.7.7	Aren’t these the words which the 
ZEC.7.8	The 
ZEC.7.9	“Thus has the 
ZEC.7.10	Don’t oppress the widow, nor the fatherless, the foreigner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.’ 
ZEC.7.11	But they refused to listen, and turned their backs, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear. 
ZEC.7.12	Yes, they made their hearts as hard as flint, lest they might hear the law, and the words which the 
ZEC.7.13	It has come to pass that, as he called, and they refused to listen, so they will call, and I will not listen,” said the 
ZEC.7.14	“but I will scatter them with a whirlwind amongst all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they made the pleasant land desolate.”
ZEC.8.1	The word of the 
ZEC.8.2	The 
ZEC.8.3	The 
ZEC.8.4	The 
ZEC.8.5	The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.”
ZEC.8.6	The 
ZEC.8.7	The 
ZEC.8.8	and I will bring them, and they will dwell within Jerusalem; and they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.”
ZEC.8.9	The 
ZEC.8.10	For before those days there was no wages for man, nor any wages for an animal; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all men everyone against his neighbour. 
ZEC.8.11	But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days,” says the 
ZEC.8.12	“For the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit, and the ground will give its increase, and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. 
ZEC.8.13	It shall come to pass that, as you were a curse amongst the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Don’t be afraid. Let your hands be strong.”
ZEC.8.14	For the 
ZEC.8.15	so again I have thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Don’t be afraid. 
ZEC.8.16	These are the things that you shall do: speak every man the truth with his neighbour. Execute the judgement of truth and peace in your gates, 
ZEC.8.17	and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbour, and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate,” says the 
ZEC.8.18	The word of the 
ZEC.8.19	The 
ZEC.8.20	The 
ZEC.8.21	and the inhabitants of one shall go to another, saying, ‘Let’s go speedily to entreat the favour of the

ZEC.8.23	The 
ZEC.9.1	A revelation.
ZEC.9.1	The 
ZEC.9.1	and will rest upon Damascus;
ZEC.9.1	for the eye of man
ZEC.9.1	and of all the tribes of Israel is towards the 
ZEC.9.2	and Hamath, also, which borders on it;
ZEC.9.2	Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.
ZEC.9.3	Tyre built herself a stronghold,
ZEC.9.3	and heaped up silver like the dust,
ZEC.9.3	and fine gold like the mire of the streets.
ZEC.9.4	Behold, the Lord will dispossess her,
ZEC.9.4	and he will strike her power in the sea;
ZEC.9.4	and she will be devoured with fire.
ZEC.9.5	Ashkelon will see it, and fear;
ZEC.9.5	Gaza also, and will writhe in agony;
ZEC.9.5	as will Ekron, for her expectation will be disappointed;
ZEC.9.5	and the king will perish from Gaza,
ZEC.9.5	and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
ZEC.9.6	Foreigners will dwell in Ashdod,
ZEC.9.6	and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
ZEC.9.7	I will take away his blood out of his mouth,
ZEC.9.7	and his abominations from between his teeth;
ZEC.9.7	and he also will be a remnant for our God;
ZEC.9.7	and he will be as a chieftain in Judah,
ZEC.9.7	and Ekron as a Jebusite.
ZEC.9.8	I will encamp around my house against the army,
ZEC.9.8	that no one pass through or return;
ZEC.9.8	and no oppressor will pass through them any more:
ZEC.9.8	for now I have seen with my eyes.
ZEC.9.9	Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!
ZEC.9.9	Shout, daughter of Jerusalem!
ZEC.9.9	Behold, your King comes to you!
ZEC.9.9	He is righteous, and having salvation;
ZEC.9.9	lowly, and riding on a donkey,
ZEC.9.9	even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
ZEC.9.10	I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim,
ZEC.9.10	and the horse from Jerusalem;
ZEC.9.10	and the battle bow will be cut off;
ZEC.9.10	and he will speak peace to the nations:
ZEC.9.10	and his dominion will be from sea to sea,
ZEC.9.10	and from the River to the ends of the earth.
ZEC.9.11	As for you also,
ZEC.9.11	because of the blood of your covenant,
ZEC.9.11	I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water.
ZEC.9.12	Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope!
ZEC.9.12	Even today I declare that I will restore double to you.
ZEC.9.13	For indeed I bend Judah as a bow for me.
ZEC.9.13	I have filled the bow with Ephraim;
ZEC.9.13	and I will stir up your sons, Zion,
ZEC.9.13	against your sons, Greece,
ZEC.9.13	and will make you like the sword of a mighty man.
ZEC.9.14	The 
ZEC.9.14	and his arrow will flash like lightning;
ZEC.9.14	and the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet,
ZEC.9.14	and will go with whirlwinds of the south.
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.15	and they will destroy and overcome with sling stones;
ZEC.9.15	and they will drink, and roar as through wine;
ZEC.9.15	and they will be filled like bowls,
ZEC.9.15	like the corners of the altar.
ZEC.9.16	The 
ZEC.9.16	for they are like the jewels of a crown,
ZEC.9.16	lifted on high over his land.
ZEC.9.17	For how great is his goodness,
ZEC.9.17	and how great is his beauty!
ZEC.9.17	Grain will make the young men flourish,
ZEC.9.17	and new wine the virgins.
ZEC.10.1	Ask of the 
ZEC.10.1	The 
ZEC.10.1	and he gives rain showers to everyone for the plants in the field.
ZEC.10.2	For the teraphim
ZEC.10.2	and the diviners have seen a lie;
ZEC.10.2	and they have told false dreams.
ZEC.10.2	They comfort in vain.
ZEC.10.2	Therefore they go their way like sheep.
ZEC.10.2	They are oppressed, because there is no shepherd.
ZEC.10.3	My anger is kindled against the shepherds,
ZEC.10.3	and I will punish the male goats;
ZEC.10.3	For the 
ZEC.10.3	and will make them as his majestic horse in the battle.
ZEC.10.4	From him will come the cornerstone,
ZEC.10.4	from him the nail,
ZEC.10.4	from him the battle bow,
ZEC.10.4	from him every ruler together.
ZEC.10.5	They shall be as mighty men,
ZEC.10.5	treading down muddy streets in the battle;
ZEC.10.5	and they shall fight, because the 
ZEC.10.5	and the riders on horses will be confounded.
ZEC.10.6	“I will strengthen the house of Judah,
ZEC.10.6	and I will save the house of Joseph,
ZEC.10.6	and I will bring them back;
ZEC.10.6	for I have mercy on them;
ZEC.10.6	and they will be as though I had not cast them off:
ZEC.10.6	for I am the 
ZEC.10.7	Ephraim will be like a mighty man,
ZEC.10.7	and their heart will rejoice as through wine;
ZEC.10.7	yes, their children will see it, and rejoice.
ZEC.10.7	Their heart will be glad in the 
ZEC.10.8	I will signal for them, and gather them;
ZEC.10.8	for I have redeemed them;
ZEC.10.8	and they will increase as they have increased.
ZEC.10.9	I will sow them amongst the peoples;
ZEC.10.9	and they will remember me in far countries;
ZEC.10.9	and they will live with their children, and will return.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt,
ZEC.10.10	and gather them out of Assyria;
ZEC.10.10	and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon;
ZEC.10.10	and there won’t be room enough for them.

ZEC.10.11	and will strike the waves in the sea,
ZEC.10.11	and all the depths of the Nile will dry up;
ZEC.10.11	and the pride of Assyria will be brought down,
ZEC.10.11	and the sceptre of Egypt will depart.
ZEC.10.12	I will strengthen them in the 
ZEC.10.12	and they will walk up and down in his name,” says the 
ZEC.11.1	Open your doors, Lebanon,
ZEC.11.1	that the fire may devour your cedars.
ZEC.11.2	Wail, cypress tree, for the cedar has fallen,
ZEC.11.2	because the stately ones are destroyed.
ZEC.11.2	Wail, you oaks of Bashan,
ZEC.11.2	for the strong forest has come down.
ZEC.11.3	A voice of the wailing of the shepherds!
ZEC.11.3	For their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions!
ZEC.11.3	For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.
ZEC.11.4	The 
ZEC.11.5	Their buyers slaughter them, and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the 
ZEC.11.6	For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land,” says the 
ZEC.11.7	So I fed the flock of slaughter, especially the oppressed of the flock. I took for myself two staffs. The one I called “Favour”, and the other I called “Union”, and I fed the flock. 
ZEC.11.8	I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me. 
ZEC.11.9	Then I said, “I will not feed you. That which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let those who are left eat each other’s flesh.” 
ZEC.11.10	I took my staff Favour, and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant that I had made with all the peoples. 
ZEC.11.11	It was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that listened to me knew that it was the 
ZEC.11.12	I said to them, “If you think it best, give me my wages; and if not, keep them.” So they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver. 
ZEC.11.13	The 
ZEC.11.14	Then I cut apart my other staff, even Union, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
ZEC.11.15	The 
ZEC.11.16	For, behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are cut off, neither will seek those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the meat of the fat sheep, and will tear their hoofs in pieces. 
ZEC.11.17	Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock! The sword will be on his arm, and on his right eye. His arm will be completely withered, and his right eye will be totally blinded!”
ZEC.12.1	A revelation: the 
ZEC.12.2	“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the surrounding peoples, and it will also be on Judah in the siege against Jerusalem. 
ZEC.12.3	It will happen in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples. All who burden themselves with it will be severely wounded, and all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it. 
ZEC.12.4	In that day,” says the 
ZEC.12.5	The chieftains of Judah will say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in the 
ZEC.12.6	In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire amongst wood, and like a flaming torch amongst sheaves; and they will devour all the surrounding peoples, on the right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem will yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem. 
ZEC.12.7	The 
ZEC.12.8	In that day the 
ZEC.12.9	It will happen in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 
ZEC.12.10	I will pour on David’s house, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they will look to me
ZEC.12.11	In that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. 
ZEC.12.12	The land will mourn, every family apart; the family of David’s house apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 
ZEC.12.13	the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart; 
ZEC.12.14	all the families who remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.
ZEC.13.1	“In that day there will be a spring opened to David’s house and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness. 
ZEC.13.2	It will come to pass in that day, says the 
ZEC.13.3	It will happen that, when anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him, ‘You must die, because you speak lies in the 
ZEC.13.4	It will happen in that day, that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision, when he prophesies; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive: 
ZEC.13.5	but he will say, ‘I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.’ 
ZEC.13.6	One will say to him, ‘What are these wounds between your arms?’ Then he will answer, ‘Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.’
ZEC.13.7	“Awake, sword, against my shepherd,
ZEC.13.7	and against the man who is close to me,” says the 
ZEC.13.7	“Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered;
ZEC.13.7	and I will turn my hand against the little ones.
ZEC.13.8	It shall happen that in all the land,” says the 
ZEC.13.8	“two parts in it will be cut off and die;
ZEC.13.8	but the third will be left in it.
ZEC.13.9	I will bring the third part into the fire,
ZEC.13.9	and will refine them as silver is refined,
ZEC.13.9	and will test them like gold is tested.
ZEC.13.9	They will call on my name, and I will hear them.
ZEC.13.9	I will say, ‘It is my people;’
ZEC.13.9	and they will say, ‘The 
ZEC.14.1	Behold, a day of the 
ZEC.14.2	For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city will be taken, the houses rifled, and the women ravished. Half of the city will go out into captivity, and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. 
ZEC.14.3	Then the 
ZEC.14.4	His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in two, from east to west, making a very great valley. Half of the mountain will move towards the north, and half of it towards the south. 
ZEC.14.5	You shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azel; yes, you shall flee, just like you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. The 
ZEC.14.6	It will happen in that day, that there will not be light, cold, or frost. 
ZEC.14.7	It will be a unique day which is known to the 
ZEC.14.8	It will happen in that day, that living waters will go out from Jerusalem: half of them towards the eastern sea, and half of them towards the western sea. It will be so in summer and in winter.
ZEC.14.9	The 
ZEC.14.10	All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up, and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king’s wine presses. 
ZEC.14.11	Men will dwell therein, and there will be no more curse; but Jerusalem will dwell safely. 
ZEC.14.12	This will be the plague with which the 
ZEC.14.13	It will happen in that day, that a great panic from the 
ZEC.14.14	Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together: gold, and silver, and clothing, in great abundance.
ZEC.14.15	A plague like this will fall on the horse, on the mule, on the camel, on the donkey, and on all the animals that will be in those camps. 
ZEC.14.16	It will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.17	It will be, that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn’t go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.18	If the family of Egypt doesn’t go up, and doesn’t come, neither will it rain on them. This will be the plague with which the 
ZEC.14.19	This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that don’t go up to keep the feast of booths. 
ZEC.14.20	In that day there will be on the bells of the horses, “HOLY TO THE

TOB.1.2	who in the days of Enemessar
TOB.1.3	I, Tobit walked in the ways of truth and righteousness all the days of my life, and I did many alms deeds to my kindred and my nation, who went with me into the land of the Assyrians, to Nineveh. 
TOB.1.4	When I was in my own country, in the land of Israel, while I was yet young, all the tribe of Naphtali my father fell away from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there, and the temple of the habitation of the Most High was hallowed and built therein for all ages. 
TOB.1.5	All the tribes which fell away together sacrificed to the heifer Baal, and so did the house of Naphtali my father. 
TOB.1.6	I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it has been ordained to all Israel by an everlasting decree, having the first fruits and the tenths of my increase, and that which was first shorn; and I gave them at the altar to the priests the sons of Aaron. 
TOB.1.7	I gave a tenth part of all my increase to the sons of Levi, who ministered at Jerusalem. A second tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it each year at Jerusalem. 
TOB.1.8	A third tenth I gave to them to whom it was appropriate, as Deborah my father’s mother had commanded me, because I was left an orphan by my father. 
TOB.1.9	When I became a man, I took as wife Anna of the seed of our own family. With her, I became the father of Tobias. 
TOB.1.10	When I was carried away captive to Nineveh, all my kindred and my relatives ate of the bread of the Gentiles; 
TOB.1.11	but I kept myself from eating, 
TOB.1.12	because I remembered God with all my soul. 
TOB.1.13	So the Most High gave me grace and favour
TOB.1.14	And I went into Media, and left ten talents of silver in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages of Media.
TOB.1.15	And when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his place. In his time, the highways were troubled,
TOB.1.16	In the days of Enemessar, I did many alms deeds to my kindred: I gave my bread to the hungry, 
TOB.1.17	and my garments to the naked. If I saw any of my race dead, and thrown out on
TOB.1.18	If Sennacherib the king killed any, when he came fleeing from Judea, I buried them privately; for in his wrath he killed many; and the bodies were sought for by the king, and were not found. 
TOB.1.19	But one of the Ninevites went and showed to the king concerning me, how I buried them, and hid myself; and when I knew that I was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear. 
TOB.1.20	And all my goods were forcibly taken away, and there was nothing left to me, save my wife Anna and my son Tobias.

TOB.1.22	Achiacharus requested me, and I came to Nineveh. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer, keeper of the signet, steward, and overseer of the accounts. Sarchedonus appointed him next to himself, but he was my brother’s son.
TOB.2.1	Now when I had come home again, and my wife Anna was restored to me, and my son Tobias, in the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of the seven weeks, there was a good dinner prepared me, and I sat down to eat. 
TOB.2.2	I saw abundance of meat, and I said to my son, “Go and bring whatever poor man you find of our kindred, who is mindful of the Lord. Behold, I wait for you.”
TOB.2.3	Then he came, and said, “Father, one of our race is strangled, and has been cast out in the marketplace.” 
TOB.2.4	Before I had tasted anything, I sprang up, and took him up into a chamber until the sun had set. 
TOB.2.5	Then I returned, washed myself, ate my bread in heaviness, 
TOB.2.6	and remembered the prophecy of Amos, as he said,
TOB.2.6	and all your mirth into lamentation.
TOB.2.7	So I wept: and when the sun had set, I went and dug a grave, and buried him. 
TOB.2.8	My neighbours mocked me, and said, “He is no longer afraid to be put to death for this matter; and yet he fled away. Behold, he buries the dead again.” 
TOB.2.9	The same night I returned from burying him, and slept by the wall of my courtyard, being polluted; and my face was uncovered. 
TOB.2.10	I didn’t know that there were sparrows in the wall. My eyes were open and the sparrows dropped warm dung into my eyes, and white films came over my eyes. I went to the physicians, and they didn’t help me; but Achiacharus nourished me, until I went
TOB.2.11	My wife Anna wove cloth in the women’s chambers, 
TOB.2.12	and sent the work back to the owners. They on their part paid her wages, and also gave her a kid. 
TOB.2.13	But when it came to my house, it began to cry, and I said to her, Where did this kid come from? Is it stolen? Give it back to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat anything that is stolen. 
TOB.2.14	But she said, “It has been given to me for a gift more than the wages.”
TOB.2.14	I didn’t believe her, and I asked her to return it to the owners; and I was ashamed of her.
TOB.2.14	But she answered and said to me, “Where are your alms and your righteous deeds? Behold, you and all your works are known.
TOB.3.1	I was grieved and wept, and prayed in sorrow, saying,
TOB.3.2	“O Lord, you are righteous, and all your works and all your ways are mercy and truth, and you judge true and righteous judgement forever. 
TOB.3.3	Remember me, and look at me. Don’t take vengeance on me for my sins and my ignorances, and the sins of my fathers who sinned before you. 
TOB.3.4	For they disobeyed your commandments. You gave us as plunder, for captivity, for death, and for a proverb of reproach to all the nations amongst whom we are dispersed. 
TOB.3.5	Now your judgements are many and true; that you should deal with me according to my sins and the sins of my fathers; because we didn’t keep your commandments, for we didn’t walk in truth before you. 
TOB.3.6	Now deal with me according to that which is pleasing in your sight. Command my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be released, and become earth. For it is more profitable for me to die rather than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and there is much sorrow in me. Command that I be released from my distress, now, and go to the everlasting place. Don’t turn your face away from me.”
TOB.3.7	The same day it happened to Sarah the daughter of Raguel in Ecbatana of Media, that she also was reproached by her father’s maidservants; 
TOB.3.8	because that she had been given to seven husbands, and Asmodaeus the evil spirit
TOB.3.9	Why do you scourge us? If they are dead, go your ways with them. Let us never see either son or daughter from you.” 
TOB.3.10	When she heard these things, she was grieved exceedingly, so that she thought about hanging herself. Then she said, “I am the only daughter of my father. If I do this, it will be a reproach to him, and I will bring down his old age with sorrow to the grave.
TOB.3.11	Then she prayed by the window, and said, “Blessed are you, O Lord my God, and blessed is your holy and honourable name forever! Let all your works praise you forever! 
TOB.3.12	And now, Lord, I have set my eyes and my face towards you. 
TOB.3.13	Command that I be released from the earth, and that I no longer hear reproach. 
TOB.3.14	You know, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man, 
TOB.3.15	and that I never polluted my name or the name of my father, in the land of my captivity. I am the only daughter of my father, and he has no child that will be his heir, nor brother near him, nor son belonging to him, that I should keep myself for a wife to him. Seven husbands of mine are dead already. Why should I live? If it doesn’t please you to kill me, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, and that I hear no more reproach.”
TOB.3.16	The prayer of both was heard before the glory of the great God. 
TOB.3.17	Raphael also was sent to heal them both, to scale away the white films from Tobit’s eyes, and to give Sarah the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodaeus the evil spirit
TOB.4.1	In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had left in trust with Gabael in Rages of Media, 
TOB.4.2	and he said to himself, I have asked for death; why do I not call my son Tobias, that I may explain to him about the money before I die? 
TOB.4.3	And he called him, and said,
TOB.4.3	“My child, if I die, bury me. Don’t despise your mother. Honour her all the days of your life, and do that which is pleasing to her, and don’t grieve her. 
TOB.4.4	Remember, my child, that she has seen many dangers for you, when you were in her womb. When she is dead, bury her by me in one grave. 
TOB.4.5	My child, be mindful of the Lord our God all your days, and don’t let your will be set to sin and to transgress his commandments: do righteousness all the days of your life, and don’t follow the ways of unrighteousness. 
TOB.4.6	For if you do what is true, your deeds will prosperously succeed for you, and for all those who do righteousness. 
TOB.4.7	Give alms from your possessions. When you give alms, don’t let your eye be envious. Don’t turn away your face from any poor man, and the face of God won’t be turned away from you. 
TOB.4.8	As your possessions are, give alms of it according to your abundance. If you have little, don’t be afraid to give alms according to that little; 
TOB.4.9	for you lay up a good treasure for yourself against the day of necessity; 
TOB.4.10	because alms-giving delivers from death, and doesn’t allow you to come into darkness. 
TOB.4.11	Alms is a good gift in the sight of the Most High for all that give it. 
TOB.4.12	Beware, my child, of all whoredom, and take first a wife of the seed of your fathers. Don’t take a strange wife, who is not of your father’s tribe; for we are the descendants of the prophets. Remember, my child, that Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, our fathers of old time, all took wives of their kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed will inherit the land. 
TOB.4.13	And now, my child, love your kindred, and don’t scorn your kindred and the sons and the daughters of your people in your heart, to take a wife of them; for in scornfulness is destruction and much trouble, and in naughtiness is decay and great lack; for naughtiness is the mother of famine. 
TOB.4.14	Don’t let the wages of any man who works for you wait with you, but give it to him out of hand. If you serve God, you will be rewarded. Take heed to yourself, my child, in all your works, and be discreet in all your behaviour. 
TOB.4.15	And what you yourself hate, do to no man. Don’t drink wine to drunkenness, and don’t let drunkenness go with you on your way. 
TOB.4.16	Give of your bread to the hungry, and of your garments to those who are naked. Give alms from all your abundance. Don’t let your eye be envious when you give alms. 
TOB.4.17	Pour out your bread on the burial
TOB.4.18	Ask counsel of every man who is wise, and don’t despise any counsel that is profitable. 
TOB.4.19	Bless the Lord your God at all times, and ask of him that your ways may be made straight, and that all your paths and counsels may prosper; for every nation has no counsel; but the Lord himself gives all good things, and he humbles whom he will, as he will. And now, my child, remember my commandments, and let them not be blotted out of your mind. 
TOB.4.20	And now I explain to you about the ten talents of silver, which I left in trust with Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages of Media. 
TOB.4.21	And fear not, my child, because we are made poor. You have much wealth, if you fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.”
TOB.5.1	Then Tobias answered and said to him, “Father, I will do all things, whatever you have commanded me. 
TOB.5.2	But how could I receive the money, since I don’t know him?”
TOB.5.3	He gave him the handwriting, and said to him, “Seek a man who will go with you, and I will give him wages, whiles I yet live; and go and receive the money.”
TOB.5.4	He went to seek a man, and found Raphael who was an angel; 
TOB.5.5	and he didn’t know it. He said to him, “Can I go with you to Rages of Media? Do you know those places well?”
TOB.5.6	The angel said to him, “I will go with you. I know the way well. I have lodged with our brother Gabael.”
TOB.5.7	Tobias said to him, “Wait for me, and I will tell my father.”
TOB.5.8	He said to him, “Go, and don’t wait. And he went in and said to his father, “Behold, I have found someone who will go with me.”
TOB.5.8	But he said, “Call him to me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trustworthy man to go with you.”
TOB.5.9	So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another. 
TOB.5.10	And Tobit said to him, “Brother, of what tribe and of what family are you? Tell me.”
TOB.5.11	He said to him, “Do you seek a tribe and a family, or a hired man which will go with your son?”
TOB.5.11	And Tobit said to him, “I want to know, brother, your kindred and your name.”
TOB.5.12	And he said, “I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, of your kindred.”
TOB.5.13	And he said to him, “Welcome, brother. Don’t be angry with me, because I sought to know your tribe and family. You are my brother, of an honest and good lineage; for I knew Ananias and Jathan, the sons of Shemaiah the great, when we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of our increase; and they didn’t go astray in the error of our kindred. My brother, you are of a great stock. 
TOB.5.14	But tell me, what wages shall I give you? A drachma a day, and those things that be necessary for you, as to my son? 
TOB.5.15	And moreover, if you both return safe and sound, I will add something to your wages.”
TOB.5.16	And so they agreed. And he said to Tobias, “Prepare yourself for the journey. May God prosper you.” So his son prepared what was needful for the journey, and his father said to him, “Go with this man; but God, who dwells in heaven, will prosper your journey. May his angel go with you.”
TOB.5.16	Then they both departed, and the young man’s dog went with them. 
TOB.5.17	But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, “Why have you sent away our child? Isn’t he the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us? 
TOB.5.18	Don’t be greedy to add money to money; but let it be as refuse compared to our child. 
TOB.5.19	For what the Lord has given us to live is enough for us.”
TOB.5.20	Tobit said to her, “Don’t worry, my sister. He will return safe and sound, and your eyes will see him. 
TOB.5.21	For a good angel will go with him. His journey will be prospered, and he will return safe and sound.”
TOB.5.22	So she stopped weeping.
TOB.6.1	Now as they went on their journey, they came at evening to the river Tigris, and they lodged there. 
TOB.6.2	But the young man went down to wash himself, and a fish leapt out of the river, and would have swallowed up the young man. 
TOB.6.3	But the angel said to him, “Grab the fish!”
TOB.6.3	So the young man grabbed the fish, and hauled it up onto the land.
TOB.6.4	And the angel said to him, “Cut the fish open, and take the heart, the liver, and the bile, and keep them with you.” 
TOB.6.5	And the young man did as the angel commanded him; but they roasted the fish, and ate it. And they both went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatana.
TOB.6.6	The young man said to the angel, “Brother Azarias, of what use is the heart, the liver, and the bile of the fish?”
TOB.6.7	He said to him, “About the heart and the liver: If a demon or an evil spirit troubles anyone, we must burn those and make smoke of them before the man or the woman, and the affliction will flee. 
TOB.6.8	But as for the bile, it is good to anoint a man that has white films in his eyes, and he will be healed.”
TOB.6.9	But when they drew near to Rages, 
TOB.6.10	the angel said to the young man, “Brother, today we will lodge with Raguel. He is your kinsman. He has an only daughter named Sarah. I will speak about her, that she should be given to you for a wife. 
TOB.6.11	For her inheritance belongs to you, and you only are of her kindred. 
TOB.6.12	The maid is fair and wise. And now hear me, and I will speak to her father. When we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage; for I know that Raguel may in no way marry her to another according to the law of Moses, or else he would be liable to death, because it belongs to you to take the inheritance, rather than any other.”
TOB.6.13	Then the young man said to the angel, “Brother Azarias, I have heard that this maid has been given to seven men, and that they all perished in the bride-chamber. 
TOB.6.14	Now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest I go in and die, even as those before me. For a demon loves her, which harms no man, but those which come to her. Now I fear lest I die, and bring my father’s and my mother’s life to the grave with sorrow because of me. They have no other son to bury them.”
TOB.6.15	But the angel said to him, “Don’t you remember the words which your father commanded you, that you should take a wife of your own kindred? Now hear me, brother; for she will be your wife. Don’t worry about the demon; for this night she will be given you as wife. 
TOB.6.16	And when
TOB.6.17	The demon will smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more. But when you go near to her, both of you rise up, and cry to God who is merciful. He will save you, and have mercy on you. Don’t be afraid, for she was prepared for you from the beginning; and you will save her, and she will go with you. And I suppose that you will have children with her.”
TOB.6.17	When Tobias heard these things, he loved her, and his soul was strongly joined to her.
TOB.7.1	They came to Ecbatana, and arrived at the house of Raguel. But Sarah met them; and she greeted them, and they her. Then she brought them into the house. 
TOB.7.2	Raguel said to Edna his wife, “This young man really resembles Tobit my cousin!” 
TOB.7.3	And Raguel asked them, “Where are you two from, kindred?”
TOB.7.3	They said to him, “We are of the sons of Naphtali, who are captives in Nineveh.”
TOB.7.4	He said to them, “Do you know Tobit our brother?”
TOB.7.4	They said, “We know him.”
TOB.7.4	Then he said to them, “Is he in good health?”
TOB.7.5	They said, “He is both alive, and in good health.” Tobias said, “He is my father.”
TOB.7.6	And Raguel sprang up, and kissed him, wept, 
TOB.7.7	blessed him, and said to him, “You are the son of an honest and good man.” When he had heard that Tobit had lost his sight, he was grieved, and wept; 
TOB.7.8	and Edna his wife and Sarah his daughter wept. They received them gladly; and they killed a ram of the flock, and served them meat.
TOB.7.8	But Tobias said to Raphael, “Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which you talked about in the way, and let the matter be finished.”
TOB.7.9	So he communicated the thing to Raguel. Raguel said to Tobias, “Eat, drink, and make merry: 
TOB.7.10	for it belongs to you to take my child. However I will tell you the truth. 
TOB.7.11	I have given my child to seven men of our relatives, and whenever they came in to her, they died in the night. But for the present be merry.”
TOB.7.11	And Tobias said, “I will taste nothing here, until you all make a covenant and enter into that covenant with me.”
TOB.7.12	Raguel said, “Take her to yourself from now on according to custom. You are her relative, and she is yours. The merciful God will give all good success to you.” 
TOB.7.13	And he called his daughter Sarah, and took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife of Tobias, and said, “Behold, take her to yourself after the law of Moses, and lead her away to your father.” And he blessed them. 
TOB.7.14	He called Edna his wife, then took a book, wrote a contract, and sealed it. 
TOB.7.15	Then they began to eat.
TOB.7.16	And Raguel called his wife Edna, and said to her, “Sister, prepare the other chamber, and bring her in there.” 
TOB.7.17	She did as he asked her, and brought her in there. She wept, and she received the tears of her daughter, and said to her, 
TOB.7.18	“Be comforted, my child. May the Lord of heaven and earth give you favour
TOB.8.1	When they had finished their supper, they brought Tobias in to her. 
TOB.8.2	But as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the incense, and put the heart and the liver of the fish on them, and made smoke with them. 
TOB.8.3	When the demon smelled that smell, it fled into the uppermost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him. 
TOB.8.4	But after they were both shut in together, Tobias rose up from the bed, and said, “Sister, arise, and let’s pray that the Lord may have mercy on us.” 
TOB.8.5	And Tobias began to say, “Blessed are you, O God of our fathers, and blessed is your holy and glorious name forever. Let the heavens bless you, and all your creatures. 
TOB.8.6	You made Adam, and gave him Eve his wife for a helper and support. From them came the seed of men. You said, it is not good that the man should be alone. Let’s make him a helper like him. 
TOB.8.7	And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lust, but in truth. Command that I may find mercy and grow old with her.”
TOB.8.8	She said with him, “Amen.” And they both slept that night.
TOB.8.9	Raguel arose, and went and dug a grave, 
TOB.8.10	saying, “Lest he also should die.” 
TOB.8.11	And Raguel came into his house, 
TOB.8.12	and said to Edna his wife, “Send one of the maidservants, and let them see if he is alive. If not, we will bury him, and no man will know it.”
TOB.8.13	So the maidservant opened the door, and went in, and found them both sleeping, 
TOB.8.14	and came out, and told them that he was alive.
TOB.8.15	Then Raguel blessed God, saying, “Blessed are you, O God, with all pure and holy blessing! Let your saints bless you, and all your creatures! Let all your angels and your elect bless you forever! 
TOB.8.16	Blessed are you, because you have made me glad; and it has not happened to me as I suspected; but you have dealt with us according to your great mercy. 
TOB.8.17	Blessed are you, because you have had mercy on two that were the only begotten children of their parents. Show them mercy, O Lord. Fulfil their life in health with gladness and mercy.
TOB.8.18	He commanded his servants to fill the grave. 
TOB.8.19	He kept the wedding feast for them fourteen days. 
TOB.8.20	Before the days of the wedding feast were finished, Raguel sware to him, that he should not depart till the fourteen days of the wedding feast were fulfilled; 
TOB.8.21	and that then he should take half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and the rest, said he, when my wife and I die.
TOB.9.1	And Tobias called Raphael, and said to him, 
TOB.9.2	“Brother Azarias, take with you a servant and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and receive the money for me, and bring him to the wedding feast, 
TOB.9.3	because Raguel has sworn that I must not depart. 
TOB.9.4	My father counts the days; and if I wait long, he will be very grieved. 
TOB.9.5	So Raphael went on his way, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting; so he brought forth the bags with their seals, and gave them to him. 
TOB.9.6	Then they rose up early in the morning together, and came to the wedding feast. Tobias blessed his wife.
TOB.10.1	Tobit his father counted every day. When the days of the journey were expired, and they didn’t come, 
TOB.10.2	he said, “Is he perchance detained?
TOB.10.3	He was very grieved.
TOB.10.4	But his wife said to him, “The child has perished, seeing he waits long.” She began to bewail him, and said, 
TOB.10.5	“I care about nothing,
TOB.10.6	Tobit said to her, “Hold your peace. Don’t worry. He is in good health.”
TOB.10.7	And she said to him, “Hold your peace. Don’t deceive me. My child has perished.” And she went out every day into the way by which they went, and ate no bread in the day-time, and didn’t stop bewailing her son Tobias for whole nights, until the fourteen days of the wedding feast were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there.
TOB.10.7	Then Tobias said to Raguel, “Send me away, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.” 
TOB.10.8	But his father-in-law said to him, “Stay with me, and I will send to your father, and they will declare to him how things go with you.” 
TOB.10.9	Tobias said, “No. Send me away to my father.”
TOB.10.10	Raguel arose, and gave him Sarah his wife, and half his goods, servants and cattle and money; 
TOB.10.11	and he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, “The God of heaven will prosper you, my children, before I die.” 
TOB.10.12	And he said to his daughter, “Honour your father-in-law and your mother-in-law. They are now your parents. Let me hear a good report of you.” Then he kissed her.
TOB.10.12	Edna said to Tobias, “May the Lord of heaven restore you, dear brother, and grant to me that I may see your children of my daughter Sarah, that I may rejoice before the Lord. Behold, I commit my daughter to you in special trust. Don’t cause her grief.
TOB.11.1	After these things Tobias also went his way, blessing God because he had prospered his journey; and he blessed Raguel and Edna his wife. Then he went on his way until they drew near to Nineveh. 
TOB.11.2	Raphael said to Tobias, “Don’t you know, brother, how you left your father? 
TOB.11.3	Let’s run forward before your wife, and prepare the house. 
TOB.11.4	But take in your hand the bile of the fish.” So they went their way, and the dog went after them.
TOB.11.5	Anna sat looking around towards the path for her son. 
TOB.11.6	She saw him coming, and said to his father, “Behold, your son is coming with the man that went with him!”
TOB.11.7	Raphael said, “I know, Tobias, that your father will open his eyes. 
TOB.11.8	Therefore anoint his eyes with the bile, and being pricked with it, he will rub, and will make the white films fall away. Then he will see you.”
TOB.11.9	Anna ran to him, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said to him, “I have seen you, my child! I am ready to die.” They wept both.
TOB.11.10	Tobit went towards the door and stumbled; but his son ran to him, 
TOB.11.11	and took hold of his father. He rubbed the bile on his father’s eyes, saying, “Cheer up, my father.” 
TOB.11.12	When his eyes began to hurt, he rubbed them. 
TOB.11.13	Then the white films peeled away from the corners of his eyes; and he saw his son, and fell upon his neck.
TOB.11.14	He wept, and said, “Blessed are you, O God, and blessed is your name forever! Blessed are all your holy angels! 
TOB.11.15	For you scourged, and had mercy on me. Behold, I see my son Tobias.” And his son went in rejoicing, and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.
TOB.11.16	Tobit went out to meet his daughter-in-law at the gate of Nineveh, rejoicing, and blessing God. Those who saw him go marvelled, because he had received his sight. 
TOB.11.17	Tobit gave thanks before them, because God had shown mercy on him. When Tobit came near to Sarah his daughter-in-law, he blessed her, saying, “Welcome, daughter! Blessed is God who has brought you to us, and blessed are your father and your mother.” And there was joy amongst all his kindred who were at Nineveh. 
TOB.11.18	Achiacharus and Nasbas his brother’s son came. 
TOB.11.19	Tobias’ wedding feast was kept seven days with great gladness.
TOB.12.1	And Tobit called his son Tobias, and said to him, “See, my child, that the man which went with you have his wages, and you must give him more.”
TOB.12.2	And he said to him, “Father, it is no harm to me to give him the half of those things which I have brought; 
TOB.12.3	for he has led me for you in safety, and he cured my wife, and brought my money, and likewise cured you.”
TOB.12.4	The old man said, “It is due to him.”
TOB.12.5	And he called the angel, and said to him, “Take half of all that you all have brought.”
TOB.12.6	Then he called them both privately, and said to them, “Bless God, and give him thanks, and magnify him, and give him thanks in the sight of all that live, for the things which he has done with you. It is good to bless God and exalt his name, showing forth with honour the works of God. Don’t be slack to give him thanks. 
TOB.12.7	It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God. Do good, and evil won’t find you. 
TOB.12.8	Good is prayer with fasting, alms, and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold. 
TOB.12.9	Alms delivers from death, and it purges away all sin. Those who give alms and do righteousness will be filled with life; 
TOB.12.10	but those who sin are enemies to their own life. 
TOB.12.11	Surely I will keep nothing closed from you. I have said, ‘It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God.’ 
TOB.12.12	And now, when you prayed, and Sarah your daughter-in-law, I brought the memorial of your prayer before the Holy One. When you buried the dead, I was with you likewise. 
TOB.12.13	And when you didn’t delay to rise up, and leave your dinner, that you might go and cover the dead, your good deed was not hidden from me. I was with you. 
TOB.12.14	And now God sent me to heal you and Sarah your daughter-in-law. 
TOB.12.15	I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and go in before the glory of the Holy One.”
TOB.12.16	And they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces; for they were afraid. 
TOB.12.17	And he said to them, “Don’t be afraid. You will all have peace; but bless God forever. 
TOB.12.18	For I came not of any favour of my own, but by the will of your God. Therefore bless him forever. 
TOB.12.19	All these days I appeared to you. I didn’t eat or drink, but you all saw a vision. 
TOB.12.20	Now give God thanks, because I ascend to him that sent me. Write in a book all the things which have been done.” 
TOB.12.21	Then they rose up, and saw him no more. 
TOB.12.22	They confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared to them.
TOB.13.1	And Tobit wrote a prayer for rejoicing, and said,
TOB.13.1	“Blessed is God who lives forever!
TOB.13.1	Blessed is his kingdom!
TOB.13.2	For he scourges, and shows mercy.
TOB.13.2	He leads down to the grave,
TOB.13.2	There is no one that will escape his hand.
TOB.13.3	Give thanks to him before the Gentiles, all you children of Israel!
TOB.13.3	For he has scattered us amongst them.
TOB.13.4	Declare his greatness, there.
TOB.13.4	Extol him before all the living;
TOB.13.4	because he is our Lord,
TOB.13.4	and God is our Father forever.
TOB.13.5	He will scourge us for our iniquities, and will again show mercy,
TOB.13.5	and will gather us out of all the nations amongst whom you are all scattered.
TOB.13.6	If you turn to him with your whole heart and with your whole soul,
TOB.13.6	to do truth before him,
TOB.13.6	then he will turn to you,
TOB.13.6	and won’t hide his face from you.
TOB.13.6	See what he will do with you.
TOB.13.6	Give him thanks with your whole mouth.
TOB.13.6	Bless the Lord of righteousness.
TOB.13.6	Exalt the everlasting King.
TOB.13.6	I give him thanks in the land of my captivity,
TOB.13.6	and show his strength and majesty to a nation of sinners.
TOB.13.6	Turn, you sinners, and do righteousness before him.
TOB.13.6	Who can tell if he will accept you and have mercy on you?
TOB.13.7	I exalt my God.
TOB.13.7	My soul exalts the King of heaven,
TOB.13.7	and rejoices in his greatness.
TOB.13.8	Let all men speak,
TOB.13.8	and let them give him thanks in Jerusalem.
TOB.13.9	O Jerusalem, the holy city,
TOB.13.9	he will scourge you for the works of your sons,
TOB.13.9	and will again have mercy on the sons of the righteous.
TOB.13.10	Give thanks to the Lord with goodness,
TOB.13.10	and bless the everlasting King,
TOB.13.10	that his tabernacle may be built in you again with joy,
TOB.13.10	and that he may make glad in you those who are captives,
TOB.13.10	and love in you forever those who are miserable.
TOB.13.11	Many nations will come from afar to the name of the Lord God
TOB.13.11	with gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven.
TOB.13.11	Generations of generations will praise you,
TOB.13.11	and sing songs of rejoicing.
TOB.13.12	All those who hate you are cursed.
TOB.13.12	All those who love you forever will be blessed.
TOB.13.13	Rejoice and be exceedingly glad for the sons of the righteous;
TOB.13.13	for they will be gathered together and will bless the Lord of the righteous.
TOB.13.14	Oh blessed are those who love you.
TOB.13.14	They will rejoice for your peace.
TOB.13.14	Blessed are all those who sorrowed for all your scourges;
TOB.13.14	because they will rejoice for you when they have seen all your glory.
TOB.13.14	They will be made glad forever.
TOB.13.15	Let my soul bless God the great King.
TOB.13.16	For Jerusalem will be built with sapphires, emeralds, and precious stones;
TOB.13.16	your walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.
TOB.13.17	The streets of Jerusalem will be paved with beryl, carbuncle, and stones of Ophir.
TOB.13.18	All her streets will say, “Hallelujah!”
TOB.13.18	and give praise, saying, “Blessed be God, who has exalted you forever!”
TOB.14.1	Then Tobit finished giving thanks. 
TOB.14.2	He was fifty-eight years old when he lost his sight. After eight years, he received it again. He gave alms and he feared the Lord God more and more, and gave thanks to him.
TOB.14.3	Now he grew very old; and he called his son with the six sons of his son, and said to him, “My child, take your sons. Behold, I have grown old, and am ready to depart out of this life. 
TOB.14.4	Go into Media, my child, for I surely believe all the things which Jonah the prophet spoke of Nineveh, that it will be overthrown, but in Media there will rather be peace for a season. Our kindred will be scattered in the earth from the good land. Jerusalem will be desolate, and the house of God in it will be burnt up, and will be desolate for a time. 
TOB.14.5	God will again have mercy on them, and bring them back into the land, and they will build the house, but not like to the former house, until the times of that age are fulfilled. Afterward they will return from the places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem with honour. The house of God will be built in it forever with a glorious building, even as the prophets spoke concerning it. 
TOB.14.6	And all the nations will turn to fear the Lord God truly, and will bury their idols. 
TOB.14.7	All the nations will bless the Lord, and his people will give thanks to God, and the Lord will exalt his people; and all those who love the Lord God in truth and righteousness will rejoice, showing mercy to our kindred. 
TOB.14.8	And now, my child, depart from Nineveh, because those things which the prophet Jonah spoke will surely come to pass. 
TOB.14.9	But you must keep the law and the ordinances, and show yourself merciful and righteous, that it may be well with you. 
TOB.14.10	Bury me decently, and your mother with me. Don’t stay at Nineveh. See, my child, what Aman did to Achiacharus that nourished him, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and all the recompense that he made him. Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his recompense, and he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snare of death which he set for him; but Aman fell into the snare, and perished. 
TOB.14.11	And now, my children, consider what alms does, and how righteousness delivers.”
TOB.14.11	While he was saying these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed; but he was one hundred and fifty eight years old. Tobias buried him magnificently. 
TOB.14.12	When Anna died, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and his sons to Ecbatana to Raguel his father-in-law, 
TOB.14.13	and he grew old in honour, and he buried his father-in-law and mother-in-law magnificently, and he inherited their possessions, and his father Tobit’s. 
TOB.14.14	He died at Ecbatana of Media, being one hundred and twenty seven years old. 
TOB.14.15	Before he died, he heard of the destruction of Nineveh, which Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus took captive. Before his death, he rejoiced over Nineveh.
JDT.1.1	In the twelfth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, who reigned over the Assyrians in Nineveh, the great city, in the days of Arphaxad, who reigned over the Medes in Ecbatana, 
JDT.1.2	and built around Ecbatana walls of hewn stones three cubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wall seventy cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits; 
JDT.1.3	and set its towers at its gates, one hundred cubits high, and its breadth in the foundation was sixty cubits; 
JDT.1.4	and made its gates, even gates that were raised to the height of seventy cubits, and their breadth forty cubits, for his mighty army to go out of, and the setting in array of his footmen— 
JDT.1.5	even in those days king Nebuchadnezzar made war with king Arphaxad in the great plain. This plain is on the borders of Ragau. 
JDT.1.6	There came to meet him all that lived in the hill country, and all that lived by Euphrates, Tigris, and Hydaspes, and in the plain of Arioch the king of the Elymaeans. Many nations of the sons of Chelod assembled themselves to the battle.
JDT.1.7	And Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians sent to all who lived in Persia, and to all who lived westward, to those who lived in Cilicia, Damascus, Libanus, and Antilibanus, and to all who lived along the sea coast, 
JDT.1.8	and to those amongst the nations that were of Carmel and Gilead, and to the higher Galilee and the great plain of Esdraelon, 
JDT.1.9	and to all who were in Samaria and its cities, and beyond Jordan to Jerusalem, Betane, Chellus, Kadesh, the river of Egypt, Tahpanhes, Rameses, and all the land of Goshen, 
JDT.1.10	until you come above Tanis and Memphis, and to all that lived in Egypt, until you come to the borders of Ethiopia. 
JDT.1.11	All those who lived in all the land made light of the commandment of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians, and didn’t go with him to the war; for they were not afraid of him, but he was before them as one man. They turned away his messengers from their presence without effect, and with disgrace. 
JDT.1.12	And Nebuchadnezzar was exceedingly angry with all this land, and he swore by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely be avenged upon all the coasts of Cilicia, Damascus, and Syria, that he would kill with his sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, all Judea, and all that were in Egypt, until you come to the borders of the two seas. 
JDT.1.13	And he set the battle in array with his army against king Arphaxad in the seventeenth year; and he prevailed in his battle, and turned to flight all the army of Arphaxad, with all his horses and all his chariots. 
JDT.1.14	He became master of his cities, and he came even to Ecbatana, and took the towers, plundered its streets, and turned its beauty into shame. 
JDT.1.15	He took Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, struck him through with his darts, and utterly destroyed him, to this day. 
JDT.1.16	He returned with them to Nineveh, he and all his company of sundry nations, an exceedingly great multitude of men of war, and there he took his ease and banqueted, he and his army, for one hundred and twenty days.
JDT.2.1	In the eighteenth year, the twenty-second day of the first month, there was talk in the house of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians, that he should be avenged on all the land, even as he spoke. 
JDT.2.2	He called together all his servants and all his great men, and communicated with them his secret counsel, and concluded the afflicting of all the land out of his own mouth. 
JDT.2.3	They decreed to destroy all flesh which didn’t follow the word of his mouth. 
JDT.2.4	It came to pass, when he had ended his counsel, Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians called Holofernes the chief captain of his army, which was next after himself, and said to him, 
JDT.2.5	“The great king, the lord of all the earth, says: Behold, you shall go out from my presence, and take with you men who trust in their strength, to one hundred and twenty thousand footmen and twelve thousand horses with their riders. 
JDT.2.6	And you shall go out against all the west country, because they disobeyed the commandment of my mouth. 
JDT.2.7	You shall declare to them that they should prepare earth and water, because I will go out in my wrath against them, and will cover the whole face of the earth with the feet of my army, and I will give them as plunder to them. 
JDT.2.8	Their slain will fill their valleys and brooks, and the river will be filled with their dead until it overflows. 
JDT.2.9	I will lead them captives to the utmost parts of all the earth. 
JDT.2.10	But you shall go forth, and take all their coasts for me first. If they will yield themselves to you,
JDT.2.11	As for those who are disobedient, your eye shall not spare; but you shall give them up to be slain and to be plundered in all your land. 
JDT.2.12	For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, I have spoken, and I will do this with my hand. 
JDT.2.13	Moreover, you shall not transgress anything of the commandments of your lord, but you shall surely accomplish them, as I have commanded you. You shall not defer to do them.”
JDT.2.14	So Holofernes went out from the presence of his lord, and called all the governors, the captains, and officers of the army of Asshur. 
JDT.2.15	He counted chosen men for the battle, as his lord had commanded him, to one hundred and twenty thousand, with twelve thousand archers on horseback. 
JDT.2.16	He arranged them as a great multitude is ordered for the war. 
JDT.2.17	He took camels and asses and mules for their baggage, an exceedingly great multitude, and sheep and oxen and goats without number for their provision, 
JDT.2.18	and great store of rations for every man, and exceedingly much gold and silver out of the king’s house. 
JDT.2.19	He went out, he and all his army, on their journey, to go before king Nebuchadnezzar, and to cover all the face of the earth westward with their chariots, horsemen, and chosen footmen. 
JDT.2.20	A great company of various nations went out with them like locusts, and like the sand of the earth. For they could not be counted by reason of their multitude.
JDT.2.21	And they departed out of Nineveh three days’ journey towards the plain of Bectileth, and encamped from Bectileth near the mountain which is at the left hand of the upper Cilicia. 
JDT.2.22	And he took all his army, his footmen, horsemen, and chariots, and went away from there into the hill country, 
JDT.2.23	and destroyed Put and Lud, and plundered all the children of Rasses and the children of Ishmael, which were along the wilderness to the south of the land of the Chellians. 
JDT.2.24	And he went over Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia, and broke down all the high cities that were upon the river Arbonai, until you come to the sea. 
JDT.2.25	And he took possession of the borders of Cilicia, and killed all that resisted him, and came to the borders of Japheth, which were towards the south, opposite Arabia. 
JDT.2.26	He surrounded all the children of Midian, and set their tents on fire, and plundered their sheepfolds. 
JDT.2.27	He went down into the plain of Damascus in the days of wheat harvest, and set all their fields on fire, and utterly destroyed their flocks and herds, and plundered their cities, laid their plains waste, and struck all their young men with the edge of the sword.
JDT.2.28	And the fear and the dread of him fell upon those who lived on the sea coast, upon those who were in Sidon and Tyre, those who lived in Sur and Ocina, and all who lived in Jemnaan. Those who lived in Azotus and Ascalon feared him exceedingly.
JDT.3.1	And they sent to him messengers with words of peace, saying, 
JDT.3.2	“Behold, we the servants of Nebuchadnezzar the great king lie before you. Use us as it is pleasing in your sight. 
JDT.3.3	Behold, our dwellings, and all our country, and all our fields of wheat, and our flocks and herds, and all the sheepfolds of our tents, lie before your face. Use them as it may please you. 
JDT.3.4	Behold, even our cities and those who dwell in them are your servants. Come and deal with them as it is good in your eyes.”
JDT.3.5	So the men came to Holofernes, and declared to him according to these words.
JDT.3.6	He came down towards the sea coast, he and his army, and set garrisons in the high cities, and took out of them chosen men for allies. 
JDT.3.7	They received him, they and all the country round about them, with garlands and dances and timbrels. 
JDT.3.8	He cast down all their borders, and cut down their sacred groves. It had been given to him to destroy all the gods of the land, that all the nations would worship Nebuchadnezzar only, and that all their tongues and their tribes would call upon him as god. 
JDT.3.9	Then he came towards Esdraelon near to Dotaea, which is opposite the great ridge of Judea. 
JDT.3.10	He encamped between Geba and Scythopolis. He was there a whole month, that he might gather together all the baggage of his army.
JDT.4.1	The children of Israel that lived in Judea heard all that Holofernes the chief captain of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians had done to the nations, and how he had plundered all their temples and destroyed them utterly. 
JDT.4.2	They were exceedingly afraid before him, and were troubled for Jerusalem, and for the temple of the Lord their God; 
JDT.4.3	because they had newly come up from the captivity, and all the people of Judea were recently gathered together; and the vessels, the altar, and the house were sanctified after being profaned.
JDT.4.4	And they sent into every coast of Samaria, to Konae, to Beth-horon, Belmaim, Jericho, to Choba, Aesora, and to the valley of Salem; 
JDT.4.5	and they occupied beforehand all the tops of the high mountains, fortified the villages that were in them, stored supplies for the provision of war; for their fields were newly reaped. 
JDT.4.6	Joakim the high priest, who was in those days at Jerusalem, wrote to those who lived in Bethulia, and Betomesthaim, which is opposite Esdraelon towards the plain that is near to Dothaim, 
JDT.4.7	charging them to seize upon the ascents of the hill country; because by them was the entrance into Judea, and it was easy to stop them from approaching, inasmuch as the approach was narrow, with space for two men at the most. 
JDT.4.8	And the children of Israel did as Joakim the high priest had commanded them, as did the senate of all the people of Israel, which lived at Jerusalem.
JDT.4.9	And every man of Israel cried to God with great earnestness, and with great earnestness they humbled their souls. 
JDT.4.10	They, their wives, their children, their cattle, and every sojourner, hireling, and servant bought with their money put sackcloth on their loins. 
JDT.4.11	Every man and woman of Israel, and the little children, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, fell before the temple, and cast ashes upon their heads, and spread out their sackcloth before the Lord. They put sackcloth around the altar. 
JDT.4.12	They cried to the God of Israel earnestly with one consent, that he would not give their children as prey, their wives as plunder, the cities of their inheritance to destruction, and the sanctuary to being profaned and being made a reproach, for the nations to rejoice at. 
JDT.4.13	The Lord heard their voice, and looked at their affliction. The people continued fasting many days in all Judea and Jerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty. 
JDT.4.14	And Joakim the high priest, and all the priests that stood before the Lord, and those who ministered to the Lord, had their loins dressed in sackcloth, and offered the continual burnt offering, the vows, and the free gifts of the people. 
JDT.4.15	They had ashes on their hats. They cried to the Lord with all their power, that he would look upon all the house of Israel for good.
JDT.5.1	Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Asshur, was told that the children of Israel had prepared for war, had shut up the passages of the hill country, had fortified all the tops of the high hills, and had laid impediments in the plains. 
JDT.5.2	Then he was exceedingly angry, and he called all the princes of Moab, and the captains of Ammon, and all the governors of the sea coast, 
JDT.5.3	and he said to them, “Tell me now, you sons of Canaan, who are these people who dwell in the hill country? What are the cities that they inhabit? How large is their army? Where is their power and their strength? What king is set over them, to be the leader of their army? 
JDT.5.4	Why have they turned their backs, that they should not come and meet me, more than all that dwell in the west?”
JDT.5.5	Then Achior, the leader of all the children of Ammon, said to him, “Let my lord now hear a word from the mouth of your servant, and I will tell you the truth concerning these people who dwell in this hill country, near to the place where you dwell. No lie will come out of the mouth of your servant. 
JDT.5.6	These people are descended from the Chaldeans. 
JDT.5.7	They sojourned before this in Mesopotamia, because they didn’t want to follow the gods of their fathers, which were in the land of the Chaldeans. 
JDT.5.8	They departed from the way of their parents, and worshipped the God of heaven, the God whom they knew. Their parents cast them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned there many days. 
JDT.5.9	Then their God commanded them to depart from the place where they sojourned, and to go into the land of Canaan. They lived there, and prospered with gold and silver, and with exceedingly much cattle. 
JDT.5.10	Then they went down into Egypt, for a famine covered all the land of Canaan. They sojourned there until they had grown up. They became a great multitude there, so that one could not count the population of their nation. 
JDT.5.11	Then the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealt subtly with them, and brought them low, making them labour in brick,
JDT.5.12	They cried to their God, and he struck all the land of Egypt with incurable plagues; so the Egyptians cast them out of their sight. 
JDT.5.13	God dried up the Red sea before them, 
JDT.5.14	and brought them into the way of Sinai Kadesh-Barnea, and they cast out all that lived in the wilderness. 
JDT.5.15	They lived in the land of the Amorites, and they destroyed by their strength everyone in Heshbon. Passing over Jordan, they possessed all the hill country. 
JDT.5.16	They cast out before them the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Shechemite, and all the Girgashites, and they lived in that country many days. 
JDT.5.17	And while they didn’t sin before their God, they prospered, because God who hates iniquity was with them. 
JDT.5.18	But when they departed from the way which he appointed them, they were destroyed in many severe battles, and were led captives into a land that was not theirs. The temple of their God was cast to the ground, and their cities were taken by their adversaries. 
JDT.5.19	And now they have returned to their God, and have come up from the dispersion where they were dispersed, and have possessed Jerusalem, where their sanctuary is, and are seated in the hill country; for it was desolate. 
JDT.5.20	And now, my lord and master, if there is any error in this people, and they sin against their God, we will consider what this thing is in which they stumble, and we will go up and overcome them. 
JDT.5.21	But if there is no lawlessness in their nation, let my lord now pass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and we will be a reproach before all the earth.”
JDT.5.22	It came to pass, when Achior had finished speaking these words, all the people standing around the tent murmured. The great men of Holofernes, and all that lived by the sea side and in Moab, said that he should kill him. 
JDT.5.23	For, they said, “We will not be afraid of the children of Israel, because, behold, they are a people that has no power nor might to make the battle strong. 
JDT.5.24	Therefore now we will go up, and they will be a prey to be devoured by all your army, Lord Holofernes.”
JDT.6.1	And when the disturbance of the men that were around the council had ceased, Holofernes the chief captain of the army of Asshur said to Achior and to all the children of Moab
JDT.6.2	“And who are you, Achior, and the hirelings of Ephraim,
JDT.6.3	He will send forth his might, and will destroy them from the face of the earth, and their God will not deliver them; but we his servants will strike them as one man. They will not sustain the might of our horses. 
JDT.6.4	For with them we will burn them up. Their mountains will be drunken with their blood. Their plains will be filled with their dead bodies. Their footsteps will not stand before us, but they will surely perish, says king Nebuchadnezzar, lord of all the earth; for he said, ‘The words that I have spoken
JDT.6.5	But you, Achior, hireling of Ammon, who have spoken these words in the day of your iniquity, will see my face no more from this day, until I am avenged of the race of those that came out of Egypt. 
JDT.6.6	And then the sword of my army, and the multitude of those who serve me, will pass through your sides, and you will fall amongst their slain when I return. 
JDT.6.7	Then my servants will bring you back into the hill country, and will set you in one of the cities of the ascents. 
JDT.6.8	You will not perish until you are destroyed with them. 
JDT.6.9	And if you hope in your heart that they will not be taken, don’t let your countenance fall. I have spoken it, and none of my words will fall to the ground.”
JDT.6.10	Then Holofernes commanded his servants who waited in his tent to take Achior, and bring him back to Bethulia, and deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel. 
JDT.6.11	So his servants took him, and brought him out of the camp into the plain, and they moved from the midst of the plains into the hill country, and came to the springs that were under Bethulia. 
JDT.6.12	When the men of the city saw them on the top of the hill, they took up their weapons, and went out of the city against them to the top of the hill. Every man that used a sling kept them from coming up, and cast stones against them. 
JDT.6.13	They took cover under the hill, bound Achior, cast him down, left him at the foot of the hill, and went away to their lord. 
JDT.6.14	But the children of Israel descended from their city, and came to him, untied him, led him away into Bethulia, and presented him to the rulers of their city; 
JDT.6.15	which were in those days Ozias the son of Micah, of the tribe of Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel, and Charmis the son of Melchiel. 
JDT.6.16	Then they called together all the elders of the city; and all their young men ran together, with their women, to the assembly. They set Achior in the midst of all their people. Then Ozias asked him what had happened. 
JDT.6.17	He answered and declared to them the words of the council of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken in the midst of the princes of the children of Asshur, and all the great words that Holofernes had spoken against the house of Israel. 
JDT.6.18	Then the people fell down and worshipped God, and cried, saying, 
JDT.6.19	“O Lord God of heaven, behold their arrogance, and pity the low estate of our race. Look upon the face of those who are sanctified to you this day.” 
JDT.6.20	They comforted Achior, and praised him exceedingly. 
JDT.6.21	Then Ozias took him out of the assembly into his house, and made a feast for the elders. They called on the God of Israel for help all that night.
JDT.7.1	The next day Holofernes commanded all his army and all the people who had come to be his allies, that they should move their camp towards Bethulia, take beforehand the ascents of the hill country, and make war against the children of Israel. 
JDT.7.2	Every mighty man of them moved that day. The army of their men of war was one hundred and seventy thousand footmen, plus twelve thousand horsemen, besides the baggage, and the men that were on foot amongst them: an exceedingly great multitude. 
JDT.7.3	They encamped in the valley near Bethulia, by the fountain. They spread themselves in breadth over Dothaim even to Belmaim, and in length from Bethulia to Cyamon, which is near Esdraelon.
JDT.7.4	But the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, were troubled exceedingly, and everyone said to his neighbour, “Now these men will lick up the face of all the earth. Neither the high mountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills will be able to bear their weight. 
JDT.7.5	Every man took up his weapons of war, and when they had kindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched all that night.
JDT.7.6	But on the second day Holofernes led out all his cavalry in the sight of the children of Israel which were in Bethulia, 
JDT.7.7	viewed the ascents to their city, and searched out the springs of the waters, seized upon them, and set garrisons of men of war over them. Then he departed back to his people.
JDT.7.8	All the rulers of the children of Esau, all the leaders of the people of Moab, and the captains of the sea coast came to him and said, 
JDT.7.9	“Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not losses in your army. 
JDT.7.10	For this people of the children of Israel do not trust in their spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein they dwell, for it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains. 
JDT.7.11	And now, my lord, don’t fight against them as men fight who join battle, and there will not so much as one man of your people perish. 
JDT.7.12	Remain in your camp, and keep every man of your army safe. Let your servants get possession of the water spring, which flows from the foot of the mountain, 
JDT.7.13	because all the inhabitants of Bethulia get their water from there. Then thirst will kill them, and they will give up their city. Then we and our people will go up to the tops of the mountains that are near, and will encamp upon them, to watch that not one man gets out of the city. 
JDT.7.14	They will be consumed with famine, they and their wives and their children. Before the sword comes against them they will be laid low in the streets where they dwell. 
JDT.7.15	And you will pay them back with evil, because they rebelled, and didn’t meet your face in peace.”
JDT.7.16	Their words were pleasing in the sight of Holofernes and in the sight of all his servants; and he ordered them to do as they had spoken. 
JDT.7.17	And the army of the children of Ammon moved, and with them five thousand of the children of Asshur, and they encamped in the valley. They seized the waters and the springs of the waters of the children of Israel. 
JDT.7.18	The children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon, and encamped in the hill country near Dothaim. They sent some of them towards the south, and towards the east, near Ekrebel, which is near Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur. The rest of the army of the Assyrians encamped in the plain, and covered all the face of the land. Their tents and baggage were pitched upon it in a great crowd. They were an exceedingly great multitude.
JDT.7.19	The children of Israel cried to the Lord their God, for their spirit fainted; for all their enemies had surrounded them. There was no way to escape out from amongst them. 
JDT.7.20	All the army of Asshur remained around them, their footmen and their chariots and their horsemen, thirty-four days. All their vessels of water ran dry for all the inhabitants of Bethulia. 
JDT.7.21	The cisterns were emptied, and they had no water to drink their fill for one day; for they rationed drink by measure. 
JDT.7.22	Their young children were discouraged. The women and the young men fainted for thirst. They fell down in the streets of the city, and in the passages of the gates. There was no longer any strength in them. 
JDT.7.23	All the people, including the young men, the women, and the children, were gathered together against Ozias, and against the rulers of the city. They cried with a loud voice, and said before all the elders, 
JDT.7.24	“God be judge between all of you and us, because you have done us great wrong, in that you have not spoken words of peace with the children of Asshur. 
JDT.7.25	Now we have no helper; but God has sold us into their hands, that we should be laid low before them with thirst and great destruction. 
JDT.7.26	And now summon them, and deliver up the whole city as prey to the people of Holofernes, and to all his army. 
JDT.7.27	For it is better for us to be made a plunder to them. For we will be servants, and our souls will live, and we will not see the death of our babies before our eyes, and our wives and our children fainting in death. 
JDT.7.28	We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, and our God and the Lord of our fathers, who punishes us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers. Do what we have said today!”
JDT.7.29	And there was great weeping of all with one consent in the midst of the assembly; and they cried to the Lord God with a loud voice. 
JDT.7.30	And Ozias said to them, “Brethren, be of good courage! Let us endure five more days, during which the Lord our God will turn his mercy towards us; for he will not forsake us utterly. 
JDT.7.31	But if these days pass, and no help comes to us, I will do what you say.” 
JDT.7.32	Then he dispersed the people, every man to his own camp; and they went away to the walls and towers of their city. He sent the women and children into their houses. They were brought very low in the city.
JDT.8.1	In those days Judith heard about this. She was the daughter of Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Oziel, the son of Elkiah, the son of Ananias, the son of Gideon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Ahitub, the son of Elihu, the son of Eliab, the son of Nathanael, the son of Salamiel, the son of Salasadai, the son of Israel. 
JDT.8.2	Her husband was Manasses, of her tribe and of her family. He died in the days of barley harvest. 
JDT.8.3	For he stood over those who bound sheaves in the field, and the heat came upon his head, and he fell on his bed, and died in his city Bethulia. So they buried him with his fathers in the field which is between Dothaim and Balamon. 
JDT.8.4	Judith was a widow in her house three years and four months. 
JDT.8.5	She made herself a tent upon the roof of her house, and put on sackcloth upon her loins. The garments of her widowhood were upon her. 
JDT.8.6	And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, except the eves of the Sabbaths, the Sabbaths, the eves of the new moons, the new moons, and the feasts and joyful days of the house of Israel. 
JDT.8.7	She was of a goodly countenance, and exceedingly beautiful to behold. Her husband Manasses had left her gold, silver, menservants, maidservants, cattle, and lands. She remained on those lands. 
JDT.8.8	No one said anything evil about her; for she feared God exceedingly.
JDT.8.9	She heard the evil words of the people against the governor, because they fainted for lack of water; and Judith heard all the words that Ozias spoke to them, how he swore to them that he would deliver the city to the Assyrians after five days. 
JDT.8.10	So she sent her maid, who was over all things that she had, to summon Ozias, Chabris, and Charmis, the elders of her city. 
JDT.8.11	They came to her, and she said to them, “Hear me now, O you rulers of the inhabitants of Bethulia: for your word that you have spoken before the people this day is not right. You have set the oath which you have pronounced between God and you, and have promised to deliver the city to our enemies, unless within these days the Lord turns to help you. 
JDT.8.12	Now who are you that you have tempted God this day, and stand in the place of God amongst the children of men? 
JDT.8.13	Now try the Lord Almighty, and you will never know anything. 
JDT.8.14	For you will not find the depth of the heart of man, and you will not perceive the things that he thinks. How will you search out God, who has made all these things, and know his mind, and comprehend his purpose? No, my kindred, don’t provoke the Lord our God to anger! 
JDT.8.15	For if he has not decided to help us within these five days, he has power to defend us in such time as he will, or to destroy us before the face of our enemies. 
JDT.8.16	But don’t you pledge the counsels of the Lord our God! For God is not as man, that he should be threatened; neither as the son of man, that he should be turned by entreaty. 
JDT.8.17	Therefore let’s wait for the salvation that comes from him, and call upon him to help us. He will hear our voice, if it pleases him. 
JDT.8.18	For there arose none in our age, neither is there any of us today, tribe, or kindred, or family, or city, which worship gods made with hands, as it was in the former days; 
JDT.8.19	for which cause our fathers were given to the sword, and for plunder, and fell with a great fall before our enemies. 
JDT.8.20	But we know no other god beside him. Therefore we hope that he will not despise us, nor any of our race. 
JDT.8.21	For if we are taken so, all Judea will sit upon the ground, and our sanctuary will be plundered; and he will require our blood for profaning it. 
JDT.8.22	And the slaughter of our kindred, and the captivity of the land, and the desolation of our inheritance, he will turn upon our heads amongst the Gentiles, wherever we will be in bondage. We will be an offence and a reproach before those who take us for a possession. 
JDT.8.23	For our bondage will not be ordered to favour; but the Lord our God will turn it to dishonour. 
JDT.8.24	And now, kindred, let’s show an example to our kindred, because their soul hangs upon us, and the sanctuary, the house, and the altar rest upon us. 
JDT.8.25	Besides all this let’s give thanks to the Lord our God, who tries us, even as he did our fathers also. 
JDT.8.26	Remember all the things which he did to Abraham, and all the things in which he tried Isaac, and all the things which happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he kept the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother. 
JDT.8.27	For he has not tried us in the fire, as he did them, to search out their hearts, neither has he taken vengeance on us; but the Lord does scourge them that come near to him, to admonish them.”
JDT.8.28	And Ozias said to her, “All that you have spoken, you have spoken with a good heart. There is no one who will deny your words. 
JDT.8.29	For this is not the first day wherein your wisdom is manifested; but from the beginning of your days all the people have known your understanding, because the disposition of your heart is good. 
JDT.8.30	But the people were exceedingly thirsty, and compelled us to do as we spoke to them, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which we will not break. 
JDT.8.31	And now pray for us, because you are a godly woman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns, and we will faint no more.”
JDT.8.32	Then Judith said to them, “Hear me, and I will do a thing, which will go down to all generations amongst the children of our race. 
JDT.8.33	You shall all stand at the gate tonight. I will go out with my maid. Within the days after which you said that you would deliver the city to our enemies, the Lord will visit Israel by my hand. 
JDT.8.34	But you shall not enquire of my act; for I will not declare it to you, until the things are finished that I will do.”
JDT.8.35	Then Ozias and the rulers said to her, “Go in peace. May the Lord God be before you, to take vengeance on our enemies.” 
JDT.8.36	So they returned from the tent, and went to their stations.
JDT.9.1	But Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes upon her head, and uncovered the sackcloth with which she was clothed. The incense of that evening was now being offered at Jerusalem in the house of God, and Judith cried to the Lord with a loud voice, and said, 
JDT.9.2	“O Lord God of my father Simeon, into whose hand you gave a sword to take vengeance on the strangers who loosened the belt of a virgin to defile her, uncovered the thigh to her shame, and profaned the womb to her reproach; for you said, ‘It shall not be so;’ and they did so. 
JDT.9.3	Therefore you gave their rulers to be slain, and their bed, which was ashamed for her who was deceived,
JDT.9.4	and gave their wives for a prey, and their daughters to be captives, and all their spoils to be divided amongst your dear children; which were moved with zeal for you, and abhorred the pollution of their blood, and called upon you for aid. O God, O my God, hear me also who am a widow. 
JDT.9.5	For you did the things that were before those things, and those things, and such as come after; and you planned the things which are now, and the things which are to come. The things which you planned came to pass. 
JDT.9.6	Yes, the things which you determined stood before you, and said, ‘Behold, we are here; for all your ways are prepared, and your judgement is with foreknowledge.’ 
JDT.9.7	For, behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power. They are exalted with horse and rider. They were proud of the strength of their footmen. They have trusted in shield, spear, bow, and sling. They don’t know that you are the Lord who breaks the battles. ‘The Lord’ is your name. 
JDT.9.8	Break their strength in your power, and bring down their force in your wrath; for they intend to profane your sanctuary, and to defile the tabernacle where your glorious name rests, and to destroy the horn of your altar with the sword. 
JDT.9.9	Look at their pride, and send your wrath upon their heads. Give into my hand, which am a widow, the might that I have conceived. 
JDT.9.10	Strike by the deceit of my lips the servant with the prince, and the prince with his servant. Break down their arrogance by the hand of a woman. 
JDT.9.11	For your power stands not in multitude, nor your might in strong men: but you are a God of the afflicted. You are a helper of the minorities, a helper of the weak, a protector of the forsaken, a saviour of those who are without hope. 
JDT.9.12	Yes, yes, God of my father, and God of the inheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and of the earth. Creator of the waters, King of every creature,
JDT.9.13	Make my speech and deceit to be their wound and stripe, who intend hard things against your covenant, your holy house, the top of Sion, and the house of the possession of your children. 
JDT.9.14	Make every nation and tribe of yours to know that you are God, the God of all power and might, and that there is none other that protects the race of Israel but you.”
JDT.10.1	It came to pass, when she had ceased to cry to the God of Israel, and had finished saying all these words, 
JDT.10.2	that she rose up where she had fallen down, called her maid, and went down into the house that she used to live in on the Sabbath days and on her feast days. 
JDT.10.3	She pulled off the sackcloth which she had put on, took off the garments of her widowhood, washed her body all over with water, anointed herself with rich ointment, braided the hair of her head, and put a tiara upon it. She put on her garments of gladness, which she used to wear in the days of the life of Manasses her husband. 
JDT.10.4	She took sandals for her feet, and put her chains around her, and her bracelets, her rings, her earrings, and all her jewellery, and decked herself bravely, to deceive the eyes of all men who would see her. 
JDT.10.5	She gave her maid a leather container of wine and a flask of oil, and filled a bag with parched corn, lumps of figs, and fine
JDT.10.6	They went out to the gate of the city of Bethulia, and found Ozias and the elders of the city, Chabris and Charmis standing by it. 
JDT.10.7	But when they saw her, that her countenance was altered and her apparel was changed, they wondered at her beauty very exceedingly, and said to her, 
JDT.10.8	“May the God of our fathers give you favour, and accomplish your purposes to the glory of the children of Israel, and to the exaltation of Jerusalem.”
JDT.10.8	Then she worshipped God, 
JDT.10.9	and said to them, “Command that they open the gate of the city for me, and I will go out to accomplish the things you spoke with me about.”
JDT.10.9	And they commanded the young men to open to her, as she had spoken; 
JDT.10.10	and they did so.
JDT.10.10	Then Judith went out, she, and her handmaid with her. The men of the city watched her until she had gone down the mountain, until she had passed the valley, and they could see her no more. 
JDT.10.11	They went straight onward in the valley. The watch of the Assyrians met her; 
JDT.10.12	and they took her, and asked her, “Of what people are you? Where are you coming from? Where are you going?”
JDT.10.12	She said, “I am a daughter of the Hebrews. I am fleeing away from their presence, because they are about to be given you to be consumed. 
JDT.10.13	I am coming into the presence of Holofernes the chief captain of your army, to declare words of truth. I will show him a way that he can go and win all the hill country, and there will not be lacking of his men one person, nor one life.”
JDT.10.14	Now when the men heard her words, and considered her countenance, the beauty thereof was exceedingly marvellous in their eyes. They said to her, 
JDT.10.15	“You have saved your life, in that you have hurried to come down to the presence of our master. Now come to his tent. Some of us will guide you until they deliver you into his hands. 
JDT.10.16	But when
JDT.10.17	They chose out of them a hundred men, and appointed them to accompany her and her maid; and they brought them to the tent of Holofernes.
JDT.10.18	And there was great excitement throughout all the camp, for her coming was reported amongst the tents. They came and surrounded her as she stood outside Holofernes’ tent, until they told him about her. 
JDT.10.19	They marvelled at her beauty, and marvelled at the children of Israel because of her. Each one said to his neighbour, “Who would despise this people, that have amongst them such women? For it is not good that one man of them be left, seeing that, if they are let go, they will be able to deceive the whole earth. 
JDT.10.20	Those who lay near Holofernes, and all his servants, went out and brought her into the tent. 
JDT.10.21	And Holofernes was resting upon his bed under the canopy, which was woven with purple, gold, emeralds, and precious stones. 
JDT.10.22	And they told him about her; and he came out into the space before his tent, with silver lamps going before him. 
JDT.10.23	But when Judith had come before him and his servants, they all marvelled at the beauty of her countenance. She fell down upon her face, and bowed down to him, but his servants raised her up.
JDT.11.1	Holofernes said to her, “Woman, take courage. Don’t be afraid in your heart; for I never hurt anyone who has chosen to serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of all the earth. 
JDT.11.2	And now, if your people who dwell in the hill country had not slighted me, I would not have lifted up my spear against them; but they have done these things to themselves. 
JDT.11.3	And now tell me why you fled from them and came to us; for you have come to save yourself. Take courage! You will live tonight, and hereafter; 
JDT.11.4	for there is no one that will wrong you, but all will treat you well, as is done to the servants of king Nebuchadnezzar my lord.”
JDT.11.5	And Judith said to him, “Receive the words of your servant, and let your handmaid speak in your presence, and I will declare no lie to my lord this night. 
JDT.11.6	If you will follow the words of your handmaid, God will bring the thing to pass perfectly with you; and my lord will not fail to accomplish his purposes. 
JDT.11.7	As Nebuchadnezzar king of all the earth lives, and as his power lives, who has sent you for the preservation of every living thing, not only do men serve him by you, but also the beasts of the field, the cattle, and the birds of the sky will live through your strength, in the time of Nebuchadnezzar and of all his house. 
JDT.11.8	For we have heard of your wisdom and the subtle plans of your soul. It has been reported in all the earth that you only are brave in all the kingdom, mighty in knowledge, and wonderful in feats of war. 
JDT.11.9	And now as concerning the matter which Achior spoke in your council, we have heard his words; for the men of Bethulia saved him, and he declared to them all that he had spoken before you. 
JDT.11.10	Therefore, O lord and master, don’t neglect his word; but lay it up in your heart, for it is true; for our race will not be punished, neither will the sword prevail against them, unless they sin against their God. 
JDT.11.11	And now, that my lord be not defeated and frustrate of his purpose, and that death may fall upon them, their sin has overtaken them, wherewith they will provoke their God to anger, whenever they do wickedness. 
JDT.11.12	Since their food failed them, and all their water was scant, they took counsel to lay hands upon their cattle, and determined to consume all those things which God charged them by his laws that they should not eat. 
JDT.11.13	They are resolved to spend the first fruits of the corn, and the tenths of the wine and the oil, which they had sanctified and reserved for the priests who stand before the face of our God in Jerusalem; which things it is not fitting for any of the people so much as to touch with their hands. 
JDT.11.14	They have sent some to Jerusalem, because they also that dwell there have done this thing, to bring them permission from the council of elders. 
JDT.11.15	It will be, when word comes to them and they do it, they will be given to you to be destroyed the same day. 
JDT.11.16	Therefore I your servant, knowing all this, fled away from their presence. God sent me to work things with you, at which all the earth will be astonished, even as many as hear it. 
JDT.11.17	For your servant is religious, and serves the God of heaven day and night. Now, my lord, I will stay with you, and your servant will go out by night into the valley. I will pray to God, and he will tell me when they have committed their sins. 
JDT.11.18	Then I will come and show it also to you. Then you shall go out with all your army, and there will be none of them that will resist you. 
JDT.11.19	And I will lead you through the midst of Judea, until you come to Jerusalem. I will set your seat in the midst of it. You will drive them as sheep that have no shepherd, and a dog will not so much as open his mouth before you; for these things were told me according to my foreknowledge, and were declared to me, and I was sent to tell you.”
JDT.11.20	Her words were pleasing in the sight of Holofernes and of all his servants. They marvelled at her wisdom, and said, 
JDT.11.21	“There is not such a woman from one end of the earth to the other, for beauty of face and wisdom of words.”
JDT.11.22	Holofernes said to her, “God did well to send you before the people, that might would be in our hands, and destruction amongst those who slighted my lord. 
JDT.11.23	And now you are beautiful in your countenance, and wise in your words. If you will do as you have spoken, your God will be my God, and you will dwell in the house of king Nebuchadnezzar, and will be renowned through the whole earth.”
JDT.12.1	He commanded that she should be brought in where his silver vessels were set, and asked that his servants should prepare some of his own meats for her, and that she should drink from his own wine.
JDT.12.2	And Judith said, “I will not eat of it, lest there be an occasion of stumbling: but provision will be made for me of the things that have come with me.”
JDT.12.3	And Holofernes said to her, “But if the things that are with you should fail, from where will we be able to give you more like it? For there is none of your race with us.”
JDT.12.4	And Judith said to him, “As your soul lives, my lord, your servant will not spend those things that are with me, until the Lord works by my hand the things that he has determined.” 
JDT.12.5	Then Holofernes’ servants brought her into the tent, and she slept until midnight. Then she rose up towards the morning watch, 
JDT.12.6	and sent to Holofernes, saying, “Let my lord now command that they allow your servant to go out to pray.”
JDT.12.7	Holofernes commanded his guards that they should not stop her. She stayed in the camp three days, and went out every night into the valley of Bethulia, and washed herself at the fountain of water in the camp. 
JDT.12.8	And when she came up, she implored the Lord God of Israel to direct her way to the raising up of the children of his people. 
JDT.12.9	She came in clean, and remained in the tent, until she ate her food towards evening.
JDT.12.10	It came to pass on the fourth day, that Holofernes made a feast for his own servants only, and called none of the officers to the banquet. 
JDT.12.11	And he said to Bagoas the eunuch, who had charge over all that he had, “Go now, and persuade this Hebrew woman who is with you that she come to us, and eat and drink with us. 
JDT.12.12	For, behold, it is a shame for our person, if we shall let such a woman go, not having had her company; for if we don’t draw her to ourselves, she will laugh us to scorn.”
JDT.12.13	Bagoas went from the presence of Holofernes, and came in to her, and said, “Let this fair lady not fear to come to my lord, and to be honoured in his presence, and to drink wine and be merry with us, and to be made this day as one of the daughters of the children of Asshur, which wait in the house of Nebuchadnezzar.”
JDT.12.14	Judith said to him, “Who am I, that I should contradict my lord? For whatever would be pleasing in his eyes, I will do speedily, and this will be my joy to the day of my death.” 
JDT.12.15	She arose, and decked herself with her apparel and all her woman’s attire; and her servant went and laid fleeces on the ground for her next to Holofernes, which she had received from Bagoas for her daily use, that she might sit and eat upon them.
JDT.12.16	Judith came in and sat down, and Holofernes’ heart was ravished with her. His soul was moved, and he exceedingly desired her company. He was watching for a time to deceive her, from the day that he had seen her. 
JDT.12.17	Holofernes said to her, “Drink now, and be merry with us.”
JDT.12.18	Judith said, “I will drink now, my lord, because my life is magnified in me this day more than all the days since I was born.” 
JDT.12.19	Then she took and ate and drank before him what her servant had prepared. 
JDT.12.20	Holofernes took great delight in her, and drank exceedingly much wine, more than he had drunk at any time in one day since he was born.
JDT.13.1	But when the evening had come, his servants hurried to depart. Bagoas shut the tent outside, and dismissed those who waited from the presence of his lord. They went away to their beds; for they were all weary, because the feast had been long. 
JDT.13.2	But Judith was left alone in the tent, with Holofernes lying along upon his bed; for he was drunk with wine. 
JDT.13.3	Judith had said to her servant that she should stand outside her bedchamber, and wait for her to come out, as she did daily; for she said she would go out to her prayer. She spoke to Bagoas according to the same words. 
JDT.13.4	All went away from her presence, and none was left in the bedchamber, small or great. Judith, standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lord God of all power, look in this hour upon the works of my hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem. 
JDT.13.5	For now is the time to help your inheritance, and to do the thing that I have purposed to the destruction of the enemies which have risen up against us. 
JDT.13.6	She came to the rail of the bed, which was at Holofernes’ head, and took down his scimitar from there. 
JDT.13.7	She drew near to the bed, took hold of the hair of his head, and said, “Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.” 
JDT.13.8	She struck twice upon his neck with all her might, and took away his head from him, 
JDT.13.9	tumbled his body down from the bed, and took down the canopy from the pillars. After a little while she went out, and gave Holofernes’ head to her maid; 
JDT.13.10	and she put it in her bag of food. They both went out together to prayer, according to their custom. They passed through the camp, circled around that valley, and went up to the mountain of Bethulia, and came to its gates.
JDT.13.11	Judith said afar off to the watchmen at the gates, “Open, open the gate, now. God is with us, even our God, to show his power yet in Israel, and his might against the enemy, as he has done even this day.”
JDT.13.12	It came to pass, when the men of her city heard her voice, they made haste to go down to the gate of their city, and they called together the elders of the city. 
JDT.13.13	They all ran together, both small and great, for it was strange to them that she had come. They opened the gate and received them, making a fire to give light, and surrounded them. 
JDT.13.14	She said to them with a loud voice, “Praise God! Praise him! Praise God, who has not taken away his mercy from the house of Israel, but has destroyed our enemies by my hand tonight!” 
JDT.13.15	Then she took the head out of the bag and showed it, and said to them, “Behold, the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Asshur, and behold, the canopy, in which he laid in his drunkenness. The Lord struck him by the hand of a woman. 
JDT.13.16	And as the Lord lives, who preserved me in my way that I went, my countenance deceived him to his destruction, and he didn’t commit sin with me, to defile and shame me.”
JDT.13.17	All the people were exceedingly amazed, and bowed themselves, and worshipped God, and said with one accord, “Blessed are you, O our God, which have this day brought to nothing the enemies of your people.” 
JDT.13.18	Ozias said to her, “Blessed are you, daughter, in the sight of the Most High God, above all the women upon the earth; and blessed is the Lord God, who created the heavens and the earth, who directed you to cut off the head of the prince of our enemies. 
JDT.13.19	For your hope will not depart from the heart of men that remember the strength of God forever. 
JDT.13.20	May God turn these things to you for a perpetual praise, to visit you with good things, because you didn’t spare your life by reason of the affliction of our race, but avenged our fall, walking a straight way before our God.”
JDT.13.20	And all the people said, “Amen! Amen!”
JDT.14.1	Judith said to them, “Hear me now, my kindred, and take this head, and hang it upon the battlement of your wall. 
JDT.14.2	It will be, so soon as the morning appears, and the sun comes up on the earth, you shall each take up his weapons of war, and every valiant man of you go out of the city. You shall set a captain over them, as though you would go down to the plain towards the watch of the children of Asshur; but you men shall not go down. 
JDT.14.3	These shall take up their full armour, and shall go into their camp and rouse up the captains of the army of Asshur. They will run together to Holofernes’ tent. They won’t find him. Fear will fall upon them, and they will flee before your face. 
JDT.14.4	You men, and all that inhabit every coast of Israel, shall pursue them and overthrow them as they go. 
JDT.14.5	But before you do these things, summon Achior the Ammonite to me, that he may see and know him that despised the house of Israel, and that sent him to us, as it were to death.
JDT.14.6	And they called Achior out of the house of Ozias; but when he came, and saw the head of Holofernes in a man’s hand in the assembly of the people, he fell upon his face, and his spirit failed. 
JDT.14.7	But when they had recovered him,
JDT.14.8	Now tell me all the things that you have done in these days.”
JDT.14.8	And Judith declared to him in the midst of the people all the things that she had done, from the day that she went out until the time that she spoke to them. 
JDT.14.9	But when she finished speaking, the people shouted with a loud voice, and made a joyful noise in their city. 
JDT.14.10	But when Achior saw all the things that the God of Israel had done, he believed in God exceedingly, and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined to the house of Israel, to this day.
JDT.14.11	But as soon as the morning arose, they hanged the head of Holofernes upon the wall, and every man took up his weapons, and they went forth by bands to the ascents of the mountain. 
JDT.14.12	But when the children of Asshur saw them, they sent word to their leaders; but they went to their captains and tribunes, and to every one of their rulers. 
JDT.14.13	They came to Holofernes’ tent, and said to him that was over all that he had, “Wake our lord up, now; for the slaves have been bold to come down against us to battle, that they may be utterly destroyed.” 
JDT.14.14	Bagoas went in, and knocked at the outer door of the tent; for he supposed that he was sleeping with Judith. 
JDT.14.15	But when no one listened to him, he opened it, and went into the bedchamber, and found him cast upon the threshold dead, and his head had been taken from him. 
JDT.14.16	He cried with a loud voice, with weeping and groaning and a mighty cry, and tore his garments. 
JDT.14.17	He entered into the tent where Judith lodged, and he didn’t find her. He leapt out to the people, and cried aloud, 
JDT.14.18	“The slaves have dealt treacherously! One woman of the Hebrews has brought shame upon the house of king Nebuchadnezzar; for, behold, Holofernes lies upon the ground, and his head is not on him!”
JDT.14.19	But when the rulers of the army of Asshur heard the words, they tore their coats, and their soul was troubled exceedingly. There was a cry and an exceedingly great noise in the midst of the camp.
JDT.15.1	When those who were in the tents heard, they were amazed at what happened. 
JDT.15.2	Trembling and fear fell upon them, and no man dared stay any more in the sight of his neighbour, but rushing out with one accord, they fled into every way of the plain and of the hill country. 
JDT.15.3	Those who had encamped in the hill country round about Bethulia fled away. And then the children of Israel, every one who was a warrior amongst them, rushed out upon them. 
JDT.15.4	Ozias sent to Betomasthaim, Bebai, Chobai, and Chola, and to every coast of Israel, to tell about the things that had been accomplished, and that all should rush upon their enemies to destroy them. 
JDT.15.5	But when the children of Israel heard, they all fell upon them with one accord, and struck them to Chobai. Yes, and in like manner also they of Jerusalem and of all the hill country came (for men had told them about what happened in their enemies’ camp), and those who were in Gilead and in Galilee fell upon their flank with a great slaughter, until they were past Damascus and its borders. 
JDT.15.6	The rest of the people who lived at Bethulia fell upon the camp of Asshur, and plundered them, and were enriched exceedingly. 
JDT.15.7	The children of Israel returned from the slaughter, and got possession of that which remained. The villages and the cities that were in the hill country and in the plain country, took many spoils; for there was an exceedingly great supply.
JDT.15.8	Joakim the high priest, and the elders of the children of Israel who lived in Jerusalem, came to see the good things which the Lord had showed to Israel, and to see Judith, and to salute her. 
JDT.15.9	When they came to her, they all blessed her with one accord, and said to her, “You are the exaltation of Jerusalem! You are the great glory of Israel! You are the great rejoicing of our race! 
JDT.15.10	You have done all these things by your hand. You have done with Israel the things that are good, and God is pleased with it. Blessed be you with the Almighty Lord forever.”
JDT.15.10	And all the people said, “Amen!”
JDT.15.11	And the people plundered the camp for the space of thirty days: and they gave Holofernes’ tent to Judith, along with all his silver cups, his beds, his bowls, and all his furniture. She took them, and placed them on her mule, and prepared her wagons, and heaped them on it.
JDT.15.12	And all the women of Israel ran together to see her; and they blessed her, and made a dance amongst them for her. She took branches in her hand, and distributed them to the women who were with her.
JDT.15.13	Then they made themselves garlands of olive, she and those who were with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women. All the men of Israel followed in their armour with garlands, and with songs in their mouths.
JDT.16.1	And Judith began to sing this song of thanksgiving in all Israel, and all the people sang with loud voices this song of praise. 
JDT.16.2	Judith said,
JDT.16.2	“Begin a song to my God with timbrels.
JDT.16.2	Sing to my Lord with cymbals.
JDT.16.2	Make melody to him with psalm and praise.
JDT.16.2	Exalt him, and call upon his name.
JDT.16.3	For the Lord is the God that crushes battles.
JDT.16.3	For in his armies in the midst of the people,
JDT.16.3	he delivered me out of the hand of those who persecuted me.
JDT.16.4	Asshur came out of the mountains from the north.
JDT.16.4	He came with ten thousands of his army.
JDT.16.4	Its multitude stopped the torrents.
JDT.16.4	Their horsemen covered the hills.
JDT.16.5	He said that he would burn up my borders,
JDT.16.5	kill my young men with the sword,
JDT.16.5	throw my nursing children to the ground,
JDT.16.5	give my infants up as prey,
JDT.16.5	and make my virgins a plunder.
JDT.16.6	“The Almighty Lord brought them to nothing by the hand of a woman.
JDT.16.7	For their mighty one didn’t fall by young men,
JDT.16.7	neither did sons of the Titans strike him.
JDT.16.7	Tall giants didn’t attack him,
JDT.16.7	but Judith the daughter of Merari made him weak with the beauty of her countenance.
JDT.16.8	“For she put off the apparel of her widowhood
JDT.16.8	for the exaltation of those who were distressed in Israel.
JDT.16.8	She anointed her face with ointment,
JDT.16.8	bound her hair in a tiara,
JDT.16.8	and took a linen garment to deceive him.
JDT.16.9	Her sandal ravished his eye.
JDT.16.9	Her beauty took his soul prisoner.
JDT.16.9	The scimitar passed through his neck.
JDT.16.10	“The Persians quaked at her daring.
JDT.16.10	The Medes were daunted at her boldness.
JDT.16.11	“Then my lowly ones shouted aloud.
JDT.16.11	My weak ones were terrified and trembled for fear.
JDT.16.11	They lifted up their voice, and they fled.
JDT.16.12	The sons of ladies pierced them through,
JDT.16.12	and wounded them as fugitives’ children.
JDT.16.12	They perished by the battle of my Lord.
JDT.16.13	“I will sing to my God a new song:
JDT.16.13	O Lord, you are great and glorious,
JDT.16.13	marvellous in strength, invincible.
JDT.16.14	Let all your creation serve you;
JDT.16.14	for you spoke, and they were made.
JDT.16.14	You sent out your spirit, and it built them.
JDT.16.14	There is no one who can resist your voice.
JDT.16.15	For the mountains will be moved from their foundations with the waters,
JDT.16.15	and the rocks will melt as wax at your presence:
JDT.16.15	But you are yet merciful to those who fear you.
JDT.16.16	For all sacrifice is little for a sweet savour,
JDT.16.16	And all the fat is very little for a whole burnt offering to you;
JDT.16.16	But he who fears the Lord is great continually.
JDT.16.17	“Woe to the nations who rise up against my race!
JDT.16.17	The Lord Almighty will take vengeance on them in the day of judgement,
JDT.16.17	to put fire and worms in their flesh;
JDT.16.17	and they will weep and feel their pain forever.”
JDT.16.18	Now when they came to Jerusalem, they worshipped God. When the people were purified, they offered their whole burnt offerings, their free will offerings, and their gifts. 
JDT.16.19	Judith dedicated all Holofernes’ stuff, which the people had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken for herself out of his bedchamber, for a gift to the Lord.
JDT.16.20	And the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for three months, and Judith remained with them. 
JDT.16.21	But after these days, everyone departed to his own inheritance. Judith went away to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, and was honourable in her time in all the land. 
JDT.16.22	Many desired her, and no man knew her all the days of her life, from the day that Manasses her husband died and was gathered to his people. 
JDT.16.23	She increased in greatness exceedingly; and she grew old in her husband’s house, to one hundred and five years, and let her maid go free. Then she died in Bethulia. They buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses. 
JDT.16.24	The house of Israel mourned for her seven days. She distributed her goods before she died to all those who were nearest of kin to Manasses her husband, and to those who were nearest of her own kindred. 
JDT.16.25	There was no one that made the children of Israel afraid any more in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death.
ESG.1.1	[In the second year of the reign of Ahasuerus the great king, on the first day of Nisan, Mordecai the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Jew dwelling in the city Susa, a great man, serving in the king’s palace, saw a vision. Now he was of the captivity which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried captive from Jerusalem, with Jeconiah the king of Judea. This was his dream: Behold, voices and a noise, thunders and earthquake, tumult upon the earth. And, behold, two great serpents came out, both ready for conflict. A great voice came from them. Every nation was prepared for battle by their voice, even to fight against the nation of the just. Behold, a day of darkness and blackness, suffering and anguish, affection and tumult upon the earth. And all the righteous nation was troubled, fearing their own afflictions. They prepared to die, and cried to God. Something like a great river from a little spring with much water, came from their cry. Light and the sun arose, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the honourable.
ESG.1.1	Mordecai, who had seen this vision and what God desired to do, having arisen, kept it in his heart, and desired by all means to interpret it, even until night.
ESG.1.1	Mordecai rested quietly in the palace with Gabatha and Tharrha the king’s two chamberlains, eunuchs who guarded the palace. He heard their conversation and searched out their plans. He learnt that they were preparing to lay hands on king Ahasuerus; and he informed the king concerning them. The king examined the two chamberlains. They confessed, and were led away and executed. The king wrote these things for a record. Mordecai also wrote concerning these matters. The king commanded Mordecai to serve in the palace, and gave gifts for this service. But Haman the son of Hammedatha the Bougean was honoured in the sight of the king, and he endeavored to harm Mordecai and his people, because of the king’s two chamberlains.]
ESG.1.2	in those days, when king Ahasuerus was on the throne in the city of Susa. 
ESG.1.3	In the third year of his reign, he made a feast for his friends, and the other nations, and for the nobles of the Persians and Medes, and the chief of the local governors. 
ESG.1.4	After this, after he had shown them the wealth of his kingdom and the abundant glory of his wealth during one hundred and eighty days, 
ESG.1.5	when the days of the wedding feast were completed, the king made a banquet for the people of the nations who were present in the city for six days, in the court of the king’s house, 
ESG.1.6	which was adorned with fine linen and flax on cords of fine linen and purple, fastened to golden and silver studs, on pillars of white marble and stone. There were golden and silver couches on a pavement of emerald stone, and of pearl, and of white marble, with transparent coverings variously flowered, having roses worked around it. 
ESG.1.7	There were gold and silver cups, and a small cup of carbuncle set out of the value of thirty thousand talents, with abundant and sweet wine, which the king himself drank. 
ESG.1.8	This banquet was not according to the appointed law; but as the king desired to have it. He charged the stewards to perform his will and that of the company.
ESG.1.9	Also Vashti the queen made a banquet for the women in the palace where king Ahasuerus lived. 
ESG.1.10	Now on the seventh day, the king, being merry, told Haman, Bazan, Tharrha, Baraze, Zatholtha, Abataza, and Tharaba, the seven chamberlains, servants of king Ahasuerus, 
ESG.1.11	to bring in the queen to him, to
ESG.1.12	But queen Vashti didn’t listen to him to come with the chamberlains; so the king was grieved and angered. 
ESG.1.13	And he said to his friends, “This is what Vashti said. Therefore pronounce your legal judgement on this case.”
ESG.1.14	So Arkesaeus, Sarsathaeus, and Malisear, the princes of the Persians and Medes, who were near the king, who sat chief in rank by the king, drew near to him, 
ESG.1.15	and reported to him according to the laws what it was proper to do to queen Vashti, because she had not done the things commanded by the king through the chamberlains. 
ESG.1.16	And Memucan said to the king and to the princes, “Queen Vashti has not wronged the king only, but also all the king’s rulers and princes: 
ESG.1.17	for he has told them the words of the queen, and how she
ESG.1.18	so this day the other wives of the chiefs of the Persians and Medes, having heard what she said to the king, will dare in the same way to dishonour their husbands. 
ESG.1.19	If then it seems good to the king, let him make a royal decree, and let it be written according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, and let him not alter it: ‘Don’t allow the queen to come in to him any more. Let the king give her royalty to a woman better than she.’ 
ESG.1.20	Let the law of the king which he will have made be widely proclaimed in his kingdom. Then all the women will give honour to their husbands, from the poor even to the rich.” 
ESG.1.21	This advice pleased the king and the princes; and the king did as Memucan had said, 
ESG.1.22	and sent into all his kingdom through the several provinces, according to their language, so that men might be feared in their own houses.
ESG.2.1	After this, the king’s anger was pacified, and he no more mentioned Vashti, bearing in mind what she had said, and how he had condemned her. 
ESG.2.2	Then the servants of the king said, “Let chaste, beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. 
ESG.2.3	Let the king appoint local governors in all the provinces of his kingdom, and let them select fair, chaste young ladies and bring them to the city Susa, into the women’s apartment. Let them be consigned to the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women. Then let things for purification and other needs be given to them. 
ESG.2.4	Let the woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.”
ESG.2.4	This thing pleased the king; and he did so.
ESG.2.5	Now there was a Jew in the city Susa, and his name was Mordecai, the son of Jairus, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin. 
ESG.2.6	He had been brought as a prisoner from Jerusalem, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried into captivity. 
ESG.2.7	He had a foster child, daughter of Aminadab his father’s brother. Her name was Esther. When her parents died, he brought her up to womanhood as his own. This lady was beautiful. 
ESG.2.8	And because the king’s ordinance was published, many ladies were gathered to the city of Susa under the hand of Hegai; and Esther was brought to Hegai, the keeper of the women. 
ESG.2.9	The lady pleased him, and she found favour in his sight. He hurried to give her the things for purification, her portion, and the seven maidens appointed her out of the palace. He treated her and her maidens well in the women’s apartment. 
ESG.2.10	But Esther didn’t reveal her family or her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her not to tell. 
ESG.2.11	But Mordecai used to walk every day by the women’s court, to see what would become of Esther. 
ESG.2.12	Now this was the time for a virgin to go into the king, when she should have fulfilled twelve months; for so are the days of purification fulfilled, six months while they are anointing themselves with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices and women’s purifications. 
ESG.2.13	And then the lady goes in to the king. The officer that he commands to do so will bring her to come in with him from the women’s apartment to the king’s chamber. 
ESG.2.14	She enters in the evening, and in the morning she departs to the second women’s apartment, where Hegai the king’s chamberlain is keeper of the women. She doesn’t go in to the king again, unless she is called by name. 
ESG.2.15	And when the time was fulfilled for Esther the daughter of Aminadab the brother of Mordecai’s father to go in to the king, she neglected nothing which the chamberlain, the women’s keeper, commanded; for Esther found grace in the sight of all who looked at her. 
ESG.2.16	So Esther went in to king Ahasuerus in the twelfth month, which is Adar, in the seventh year of his reign. 
ESG.2.17	The king loved Esther, and she found favour beyond all the other virgins. He put the queen’s crown on her. 
ESG.2.18	The king made a banquet for all his friends and great men for seven days, and he highly celebrated the marriage of Esther; and he granted a remission of taxes to those who were under his dominion.
ESG.2.19	Meanwhile, Mordecai served in the palace. 
ESG.2.20	Now Esther had not revealed her
ESG.2.21	Two chamberlains of the king, the chiefs of the body-guard, were grieved, because Mordecai was promoted; and they sought to kill king Ahasuerus. 
ESG.2.22	And the matter was discovered by Mordecai, and he made it known to Esther, and she declared to the king the matter of the conspiracy. 
ESG.2.23	And the king examined the two chamberlains, and hanged them. Then the king gave orders to make a note for a memorial in the royal
ESG.3.1	After this, king Ahasuerus highly honoured Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Bugaean. He exalted him and set his seat above all his friends. 
ESG.3.2	All in the palace bowed down to him, for so the king had given orders to do; but Mordecai didn’t bow down to him. 
ESG.3.3	And they in the king’s palace said to Mordecai, “Mordecai, why do you transgress the commands of the king?” 
ESG.3.4	They questioned him daily, but he didn’t listen to them; so they reported to Haman that Mordecai resisted the commands of the king; and Mordecai had shown to them that he was a Jew. 
ESG.3.5	When Haman understood that Mordecai didn’t bow down to him, he was greatly enraged, 
ESG.3.6	and took counsel to utterly destroy all the Jews who were under the rule of Ahasuerus.
ESG.3.7	In the twelfth year of the reign of Ahasuerusin the twelfth year of the reign of Ahasuerus, he made a decision by casting lots by day and month, to kill the race of Mordecai in one day. The lot fell on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. 
ESG.3.8	So he spoke to king Ahasuerus, saying, “There is a nation scattered amongst the nations in all your kingdom, and their laws differ from all the other nations. They disobey the king’s laws. It is not expedient for the king to tolerate them. 
ESG.3.9	If it seem good to the king, let him make a decree to destroy them, and I will remit into the king’s treasury ten thousand talents of silver.”
ESG.3.10	So the king took off his ring, and gave it into the hands of Haman, to seal the decrees against the Jews. 
ESG.3.11	The king said to Haman, “Keep the silver, and treat the nation as you will.” 
ESG.3.12	So the king’s recorders were called in the first month, on the thirteenth day, and they wrote as Haman commanded to the captains and governors in every province, from India even to Ethiopia, to one hundred and twenty-seven provinces; and to the rulers of the nations according to their languages, in the name of king Ahasuerus. 
ESG.3.13	The message was sent by couriers throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus, to utterly destroy the race of the Jews on the first day of the twelfth month, which is Adar, and to plunder their goods.
ESG.3.13	“Ruling over many nations and having obtained dominion over the whole world, I was determined (not elated by the confidence of power, but ever conducting myself with great moderation and gentleness) to make the lives of my subjects continually tranquil, desiring both to maintain the kingdom quiet and orderly to its utmost limits, and to restore the peace desired by all men. When I had asked my counsellors how this should be brought to pass, Haman, who excels in soundness of judgement amongst us, and has been manifestly well inclined without wavering and with unshaken fidelity, and had obtained the second post in the kingdom, informed us that a certain ill-disposed people is mixed up with all the tribes throughout the world, opposed in their law to every other nation, and continually neglecting the commands of the king, so that the united government blamelessly administered by us is not quietly established. Having then conceived that this nation is continually set in opposition to every man, introducing as a change a foreign code of laws, and injuriously plotting to accomplish the worst of evils against our interests, and against the happy establishment of the monarchy; we instruct you in the letter written by Haman, who is set over the public affairs and is our second governor, to destroy them all utterly with their wives and children by the swords of the enemies, without pitying or sparing any, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar, of the present year; that the people aforetime and now ill-disposed to us having been violently consigned to death in one day, may hereafter secure to us continually a well constituted and quiet state of affairs.”] 
ESG.3.14	Copies of the letters were published in every province; and an order was given to all the nations to be ready for that day. 
ESG.3.15	This business was hastened also in Susa. The king and Haman began to drink, but the city was troubled.
ESG.4.1	But Mordecai, having perceived what was done, tore his garments, put on sackcloth, and sprinkled dust upon himself. Having rushed forth through the open street of the city, he cried with a loud voice, “A nation that has done no wrong is going to be destroyed!” 
ESG.4.2	He came to the king’s gate, and stood; for it was not lawful for him to enter into the palace wearing sackcloth and ashes. 
ESG.4.3	And in every province where the letters were published, there was crying, lamentation, and great mourning on the part of the Jews. They wore sackcloth and ashes. 
ESG.4.4	The queen’s maids and chamberlains went in and told her; and when she had heard what was done, she was disturbed. She sent to clothe Mordecai, and take away his sackcloth; but he refused. 
ESG.4.5	So Esther called for her chamberlain Hathach, who waited upon her; and she sent to learn the truth from Mordecai. 
ESG.4.7	Mordecai showed him what was done, and the promise which Haman had made the king of ten thousand talents to be paid into the treasury, that he might destroy the Jews. 
ESG.4.8	And he gave him the copy of what was published in Susa concerning their destruction to show to Esther; and told him to charge her to go in and entreat the king, and to beg him for the people. “Remember, he said, the days of your humble condition, how you were nursed by my hand; because Haman who holds the next place to the king has spoken against us for death. Call upon the Lord, and speak to the king concerning us, to deliver us from death.”
ESG.4.9	So Hathach went in and told her all these words. 
ESG.4.10	Esther said to Hathach, “Go to Mordecai, and say, 
ESG.4.11	‘All the nations of the empire know than any man or woman who goes in to the king into the inner court without being called, that person can’t live; except to whomever the king stretches out his golden sceptre, he shall live. I haven’t been called to go into the king for thirty days.’”
ESG.4.12	So Hathach reported to Mordecai all the words of Esther. 
ESG.4.13	Then Mordecai said to Hathach, “Go, and say to her, ‘Esther, don’t say to yourself that you alone will escape in the kingdom, more than all the other Jews. 
ESG.4.14	For if you refuse to listen on this occasion, help and protection will come to the Jews from another place; but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you have been made queen for this occasion?’”
ESG.4.15	And Esther sent the man that came to her to Mordecai, saying, 
ESG.4.16	“Go and assemble the Jews that are in Susa, and all of you fast for me, and don’t eat or drink for three days, night and day. My maidens and I will also fast. Then I will go in to the king contrary to the law, even if I must die.”
ESG.4.17	So Mordecai went and did all that Esther commanded him.
ESG.4.18	[He prayed to the Lord, making mention of all the works of the Lord. 
ESG.4.19	He said, “Lord
ESG.4.20	for you have made the heaven and the earth and every wonderful thing under heaven. 
ESG.4.21	You are Lord of all, and there is no one who can resist you, Lord. 
ESG.4.22	You know all things. You know, Lord, that it is not in insolence, nor arrogance, nor love of glory, that I have done this, to refuse to bow down to the arrogant Haman. 
ESG.4.23	For I would gladly have kissed the soles of his feet for the safety of Israel. 
ESG.4.24	But I have done this that I might not set the glory of man above the glory of God. I will not worship anyone except you, my Lord, and I will not do these things in arrogance. 
ESG.4.25	And now, O Lord God, the King, the God of Abraham, spare your people, for our enemies are planning our destruction, and they have desired to destroy your ancient inheritance. 
ESG.4.26	Do not overlook your people, whom you have redeemed for yourself out of the land of Egypt. 
ESG.4.27	Listen to my prayer. Have mercy on your inheritance and turn our mourning into gladness, that we may live and sing praise to your name, O Lord. Don’t utterly destroy the mouth of those who praise you, O Lord.”
ESG.4.28	All Israel cried with all their might, for death was before their eyes. 
ESG.4.29	And queen Esther took refuge in the Lord, being taken as it were in the agony of death. 
ESG.4.30	Having taken off her glorious apparel, she put on garments of distress and mourning. Instead of grand perfumes she filled her head with ashes and dung. She greatly brought down her body, and she filled every place of her glad adorning with the her tangled hair. 
ESG.4.31	She implored the Lord God of Israel, and said, “O my Lord, you alone are our king. Help me. I am destitute, and have no helper but you, 
ESG.4.32	for my danger is
ESG.4.33	I have heard from my birth, in the tribe of my kindred that you, Lord, took Israel out of all the nations, and our fathers out of all their kindred for a perpetual inheritance, and have done for them all that you have said. 
ESG.4.34	And now we have sinned before you, and you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies, 
ESG.4.35	because we honoured their gods. You are righteous, O Lord. 
ESG.4.36	But now they have not been content with the bitterness of our slavery, but have laid their hands on the hands of their idols 
ESG.4.37	to abolish the decree of your mouth, and utterly to destroy your inheritance, and to stop the mouth of those who praise you, and to extinguish the glory of your house and your alter, 
ESG.4.38	and to open the mouth of the Gentiles to speak the
ESG.4.39	O Lord, don’t resign your sceptre to them that are not, and don’t let them laugh at our fall, but turn their counsel against themselves, and make an example of him who has
ESG.4.40	Remember us, O Lord, manifest yourself in the time of our affliction. Encourage me, O King of gods, and ruler of all dominion! 
ESG.4.41	Put harmonious speech into my mouth before the lion, and turn his heart to hate him who fights against us, to the utter destruction of him who agrees with him. 
ESG.4.42	But deliver us by your hand, and help me who am destitute, and have none but you, O Lord. 
ESG.4.43	You know all things, and know that I hate the
ESG.4.44	You know my necessity, for I abhor the symbol of my proud station, which is upon my head in the days of my
ESG.4.45	Your handmaid has not eaten at Haman’s table, and I have not honoured the banquet of the king, neither have I drunk wine of libations. 
ESG.4.46	Neither has your handmaid rejoiced since the day of my promotion until now, except in you, O Lord God of Abraham. 
ESG.4.47	O god, who has power over all, listen to the voice of the desperate, and deliver us from the hand of those who devise mischief. Deliver me from my fear.]
ESG.5.2	And having raised the golden sceptre, he laid it upon her neck, and embraced her. He said, “Speak to me.”
ESG.5.2	So she said to him, “I saw you, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of your glory; for you, my lord, are to be wondered at, and your face is full of grace.” While she was speaking, she fainted and fell.
ESG.5.2	Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her. 
ESG.5.3	The king said, “What do you desire, Esther? What is your request? Ask even to the half of my kingdom, and it shall be yours.”
ESG.5.4	Esther said, “Today is a special day. So if it seems good to the king, let both him and Haman come to the feast which I will prepare this day.”
ESG.5.5	The king said, “Hurry and bring Haman here, that we may do as Esther said.” So they both came to the feast about which Esther had spoken. 
ESG.5.6	At the banquet, the king said to Esther, “What is your request, queen Esther? You shall have all that you require.”
ESG.5.7	She said, “My request and my petition are: 
ESG.5.8	if I have found favour in the king’s sight, let the king and Haman come again tomorrow to the feast which I shall prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do the same.”
ESG.5.9	So Haman went out from the king very glad and merry; but when Haman saw Mordecai the Jew in the court, he was greatly enraged. 
ESG.5.10	Having gone into his own house, he called his friends, and his wife Zeresh. 
ESG.5.11	He showed them his wealth and the glory with which the king had invested him, and how he had promoted him to be chief ruler in the kingdom. 
ESG.5.12	Haman said, “The queen has called no one to the feast with the king but me, and I am invited tomorrow. 
ESG.5.13	But these things don’t please me while I see Mordecai the Jew in the court.
ESG.5.14	Then Zeresh his wife and his friends said to him, “Let a fifty cubit tall
ESG.5.14	The saying pleased Haman, and the gallows was prepared.
ESG.6.1	The Lord removed sleep from the king that night; so he told his servant to bring in the
ESG.6.2	And he found the
ESG.6.3	The king said, “What honour or favour have we done for Mordecai?”
ESG.6.3	The king’s servants said, “You haven’t done anything for him.”
ESG.6.4	And while the king was enquiring about the kindness of Mordecai, behold, Haman was in the court. The king said, “Who is in the court? Now Haman had come in to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows which he had prepared. 
ESG.6.5	The king’s servants said, “Behold, Haman stands in the court.”
ESG.6.5	And the king said, “Call him!”
ESG.6.6	The king said to Haman, “What should I do for the man whom I wish to honour?”
ESG.6.6	Haman said within himself, “Whom would the king honour but myself?” 
ESG.6.7	He said to the king, “As for the man whom the king wishes to honour, 
ESG.6.8	let the king’s servants bring the robe of fine linen which the king puts on, and the horse on which the king rides, 
ESG.6.9	and let him give it to one of the king’s noble friends, and let him dress the man whom the king loves. Let him mount him on the horse, and proclaim through the
ESG.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, “You have spoken well. Do so for Mordecai the Jew, who waits in the palace, and let not a word of what you have spoken be neglected!”
ESG.6.11	So Haman took the robe and the horse, dressed Mordecai, mounted him on the horse, and went through the streets of the city, and proclaimed, saying, “This is what will be done for every man whom the king wishes to honour.” 
ESG.6.12	Then Mordecai returned to the palace; but Haman went home mourning, and having his head covered.
ESG.6.13	Haman related the events that had happened to him to Zeresh his wife, and to his friends. His friends and his wife said to him, “If Mordecai is of the race of the Jews, and you have begun to be humbled before him, you will assuredly fall, and you will not be able to withstand him, for the living God is with him.” 
ESG.6.14	While they were still speaking, the chamberlains arrived, to rush Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
ESG.7.1	So the king and Haman went in to drink with the queen. 
ESG.7.2	The king said to Esther at the banquet on the second day, “What is it, queen Esther? What is your request? What is your petition? It shall be done for you, up to half of my kingdom.”
ESG.7.3	She answered and said, “If I have found favour in the sight of the king, let my life be granted as my petition, and my people as my request. 
ESG.7.4	For both I and my people are sold for destruction, pillage, and genocide. If both we and our children were sold for male and female slaves, I would not have bothered you, for this
ESG.7.5	The king said, “Who has dared to do this thing?”
ESG.7.6	Esther said, “The enemy is Haman, this wicked man!”
ESG.7.6	Then Haman was troubled before the king and the queen. 
ESG.7.7	The king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden. Haman began to beg the queen for mercy; for he saw that he was in trouble. 
ESG.7.8	The king returned from the garden; and Haman had fallen upon the bed, begging the queen for mercy. The king said, “Will you even assault my wife in my house?”
ESG.7.8	And when Haman heard it, he changed countenance. 
ESG.7.9	And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, “Behold, Haman has also prepared a gallows for Mordecai, who spoke concerning the king, and a fifty cubit high gallows has been set up on Haman’s property.”
ESG.7.9	The king said, “Let him be
ESG.7.10	So Haman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath was appeased.
ESG.8.1	On that day, king Ahasuerus gave to Esther all that belonged to Haman the slanderer. The king called Mordecai; for Esther had shown that he was related to her. 
ESG.8.2	The king took the ring which he had taken away from Haman and gave it to Mordecai. Esther appointed Mordecai over all that had been Haman’s. 
ESG.8.3	She spoke yet again to the king, and fell at his feet, and implored him to undo Haman’s mischief and all that he had done against the Jews. 
ESG.8.4	Then the king extended the golden sceptre to Esther; and Esther arose to stand near the king. 
ESG.8.5	Esther said, “If it seems good to you, and I have found favour in your sight, let an order be sent that the letters sent by Haman may be reversed, that were written for the destruction of the Jews who are in your kingdom. 
ESG.8.6	For how could I see the affliction of my people, and how could I survive the destruction of my
ESG.8.7	Then the king said to Esther, “If I have given and freely granted you all that was Haman’s, and hanged him on a gallows, because he laid his hands upon the Jews, what more do you seek? 
ESG.8.8	Write in my name whatever seems good to you, and seal it with my ring; for whatever is written at the command of the king, and sealed with my ring, cannot be countermanded. 
ESG.8.9	So the scribes were called in the first month, which is Nisan, on the twenty-third day of the same year; and orders were written to the Jews, whatever the king had commanded to the
ESG.8.10	They were written by order of the king, sealed with his ring, and the letters were sent by the couriers. 
ESG.8.11	In them, he charged them to use their own laws in every city, to help each other, and to treat their adversaries and those who attacked them as they pleased, 
ESG.8.12	on one day in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar. 
ESG.8.13	Let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom. Let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies. The following is a copy of the letter containing orders.
ESG.8.14	So the horsemen went forth with haste to perform the king’s commands. The ordinance was also published in Susa.
ESG.8.15	Mordecai went out robed in royal apparel, wearing a golden crown and a diadem of fine purple linen. The people in Susa saw it and rejoiced. 
ESG.8.16	The Jews had light and gladness 
ESG.8.17	in every city and province where the ordinance was published. Wherever the proclamation took place, the Jews had joy and gladness, feasting and mirth. Many of the Gentiles were circumcised and became Jews, for fear of the Jews.
ESG.9.1	Now in the twelfth month, on the thirteenth day of the month which is Adar, the letters written by the king arrived. 
ESG.9.2	In that day, the adversaries of the Jews perished; for no one resisted, through fear of them. 
ESG.9.3	For the chiefs of the local governors, and the princes and the royal scribes, honoured the Jews; for the fear of Mordecai was upon them. 
ESG.9.4	For the order of the king was in force, that he should be celebrated in all the kingdom. 
ESG.9.6	In the city Susa the Jews killed five hundred men, 
ESG.9.7	including Pharsannes, Delphon, Phasga, 
ESG.9.8	Pharadatha, Barea, Sarbaca, 
ESG.9.9	Marmasima, Ruphaeus, Arsaeus, and Zabuthaeus, 
ESG.9.10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha the Bugaean, the enemy of the Jews, and they plundered their property on the same day. 
ESG.9.11	The number of those who perished in Susa was reported to the king.
ESG.9.12	Then the king said to Esther, “The Jews have slain five hundred men in the city Susa. What do you think they have done in the rest of the country? What more do you ask, that it may be done for you?”
ESG.9.13	Esther said to the king, “Let it be granted to the Jews to do the same to them tomorrow. Also hang the bodies of the ten sons of Haman.”
ESG.9.14	He permitted it to be done; and he gave up to the Jews of the city the bodies of the sons of Haman to hang. 
ESG.9.15	The Jews assembled in Susa on the fourteenth day of Adar and killed three hundred men, but plundered no property.
ESG.9.16	The rest of the Jews who were in the kingdom assembled, and helped one another, and obtained rest from their enemies; for they destroyed fifteen thousand of them on the thirteenth day of Adar, but took no spoil. 
ESG.9.17	They rested on the fourteenth of the same month, and kept it as a day of rest with joy and gladness.
ESG.9.18	The Jews in the city Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day and rested; and they also observed the fifteenth with joy and gladness. 
ESG.9.19	On this account then it is that the Jews dispersed in every foreign land keep the fourteenth of Adar as a
ESG.9.20	Mordecai wrote these things in a book, and sent them to the Jews, as many as were in the kingdom of Ahasuerus, both those who were near and those who were far away, 
ESG.9.21	to establish these as joyful days, and to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar; 
ESG.9.22	for on these days the Jews obtained rest from their enemies; and in that month, which was Adar, in which a change was made for them, from mourning to joy, and from sorrow to a good day, to spend the whole of it in good days of
ESG.9.23	And the Jews consented to this as Mordecai wrote to them, 
ESG.9.24	showing how Haman the son of Hammedatha the Macedonian fought against them, how he made a decree and cast
ESG.9.25	also how he went in to the king, telling him to hang Mordecai; but all the calamities he tried to bring upon the Jews came upon himself, and he was hanged, along with his children. 
ESG.9.26	Therefore these days were called Purim, because of the lots (for in their language they are called Purim) because of the words of this letter, and because of all they suffered on this account, and all that happened to them. 
ESG.9.27	Mordecai established it, and the Jews took upon themselves, and upon their seed, and upon those that were joined to them to observe it, neither would they on any account behave differently; but these days were to be a memorial kept in every generation, city, family, and province. 
ESG.9.28	These days of the Purim shall be kept forever, and their memorial shall not fail in any generation.
ESG.9.29	Queen Esther the daughter of Aminadab, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote all that they had done, and the confirmation of the letter of Purim. 
ESG.9.31	Mordecai and Esther the queen established this decision on their own, pledging their own health to their plan. 
ESG.9.32	And Esther established it by a command forever, and it was written for a memorial.
ESG.10.1	The king levied a tax upon his kingdom both by land and sea. 
ESG.10.2	As for his strength and valour, and the wealth and glory of his kingdom, behold, they are written in the book of the Persians and Medes for a memorial.
ESG.10.3	Mordecai
ESG.10.4	[Mordecai said, “These things have come from God. 
ESG.10.5	For I remember the dream which I had concerning these matters; for not one detail of them has failed. 
ESG.10.6	There was the little spring which became a river, and there was light, and the sun and much water. The river is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen. 
ESG.10.7	The two serpents are Haman and me. 
ESG.10.8	The nations are those 
ESG.10.9	But as for my nation, this is Israel, even those who cried to God and were delivered; for the Lord delivered his people. The Lord rescued us out of all these calamities; and God worked such signs and great wonders as have not been done amongst the nations. 
ESG.10.10	Therefore he ordained two lots. One for the people of God, and one for all the other nations. 
ESG.10.11	And these two lots came for an appointed season, and for a day of judgement, before God, and for all the nations. 
ESG.10.12	God remembered his people and vindicated his inheritance. 
ESG.10.13	They shall observe these days in the month Adar, on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth day of the month, with an assembly, joy, and gladness before God, throughout the generations forever amongst his people Israel. 
ESG.10.14	In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemeus and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemeus his son, brought this letter of Purim, which they said was the same, and that Lysimachus the son of Ptolemeus, who was in Jerusalem, had interpreted.]
WIS.1.1	Love righteousness, all you who are judges of the earth.
WIS.1.1	Think of the Lord
WIS.1.1	Seek him in singleness of heart,
WIS.1.2	because he is found by those who don’t tempt him,
WIS.1.2	and is manifested to those who trust him.
WIS.1.3	For crooked thoughts separate from God.
WIS.1.3	His Power convicts when it is tested,
WIS.1.3	and exposes the foolish.
WIS.1.4	Because wisdom will not enter into a soul that devises evil,
WIS.1.4	nor dwell in a body that is enslaved by sin.
WIS.1.5	For a holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit,
WIS.1.5	and will depart from thoughts that are without understanding,
WIS.1.5	and will be ashamed when unrighteousness has come in.
WIS.1.6	For
WIS.1.6	and she will not hold a
WIS.1.6	because God is witness of his inmost self,
WIS.1.6	and is a true overseer of his heart,
WIS.1.6	and a hearer of his tongue:
WIS.1.7	Because the spirit of the Lord has filled
WIS.1.7	and that which holds all things together knows what is said.
WIS.1.8	Therefore no one who utters unrighteous things will be unseen;
WIS.1.9	For in his counsels the ungodly will be searched out,
WIS.1.9	and the sound of his words will come to the Lord to bring his lawless deeds to conviction;
WIS.1.10	because a jealous ear listens to all things,
WIS.1.10	and the noise of murmurings is not hidden.
WIS.1.11	Beware then of unprofitable murmuring,
WIS.1.11	and keep your tongue from slander;
WIS.1.11	because no secret utterance will go on its way void,
WIS.1.11	and a lying mouth destroys a soul.
WIS.1.12	Don’t court death in the error of your life;
WIS.1.12	and don’t draw destruction upon yourselves by the works of your hands,
WIS.1.13	because God didn’t make death;
WIS.1.13	neither does he delight when the living perish.
WIS.1.14	For he created all things that they might have being.
WIS.1.14	and there is no poison of destruction in them,
WIS.1.14	nor has Hades
WIS.1.15	For righteousness is immortal,
WIS.1.16	but ungodly men by their hands and their words summon
WIS.1.16	deeming him a friend they
WIS.1.16	They made a covenant with him,
WIS.1.16	because they are worthy to belong with him.
WIS.2.1	For they said
WIS.2.1	“Our life is short and sorrowful.
WIS.2.1	There is no healing when a man comes to his end,
WIS.2.1	and no one was ever known who
WIS.2.2	Because we were born by mere chance,
WIS.2.2	and hereafter we will be as though we had never been;
WIS.2.2	because the breath in our nostrils is smoke,
WIS.2.2	and reason is a spark kindled by the beating of our heart;
WIS.2.3	which being extinguished, the body will be turned into ashes,
WIS.2.3	and the spirit will be dispersed as thin air.
WIS.2.4	Our name will be forgotten in time.
WIS.2.4	No one will remember our works.
WIS.2.4	Our life will pass away as the traces of a cloud,
WIS.2.4	and will be scattered as is a mist,
WIS.2.4	when it is chased by the rays of the sun,
WIS.2.4	and
WIS.2.5	For our allotted time is the passing of a shadow,
WIS.2.5	and
WIS.2.5	because it is securely sealed, and no one
WIS.2.6	“Come therefore and let’s enjoy the good things that exist.
WIS.2.6	Let’s use the creation earnestly as in our youth.
WIS.2.7	Let’s fill ourselves with costly wine and perfumes,
WIS.2.7	and let no Spring flower pass us by.
WIS.2.8	Let’s crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither.
WIS.2.9	Let none of us go without his share in our proud revelry.
WIS.2.9	Let’s leave tokens of mirth everywhere,
WIS.2.9	because this is our portion, and this is our lot.
WIS.2.10	Let’s oppress the righteous poor.
WIS.2.10	Let’s not spare the widow,
WIS.2.10	nor reverence the grey hair of the old man.
WIS.2.11	But let our strength be a law of righteousness;
WIS.2.11	for that which is weak is proven useless.
WIS.2.12	But let’s lie in wait for the righteous man,
WIS.2.12	because he annoys us,
WIS.2.12	is contrary to our works,
WIS.2.12	reproaches us with sins against the law,
WIS.2.12	and charges us with sins against our training.
WIS.2.13	He professes to have knowledge of God,
WIS.2.13	and calls himself a child of the Lord.
WIS.2.14	He became to us a reproof of our thoughts.
WIS.2.15	He is grievous to us even to look at,
WIS.2.15	because his life is unlike other men’s,
WIS.2.15	and his paths are strange.
WIS.2.16	We were regarded by him as worthless metal,
WIS.2.16	and he abstains from our ways as from uncleanness.
WIS.2.16	He calls the latter end of the righteous happy.
WIS.2.16	He boasts that God is his father.
WIS.2.17	Let’s see if his words are true.
WIS.2.17	Let’s test what will happen at the end of his life.
WIS.2.18	For if the righteous man is God’s son, he will uphold him,
WIS.2.18	and he will deliver him out of the hand of his adversaries.
WIS.2.19	Let’s test him with outrage and torture,
WIS.2.19	that we may find out how gentle he is,
WIS.2.19	and test his patience.
WIS.2.20	Let’s condemn him to a shameful death,
WIS.2.20	for he will be overseen according to his words.”
WIS.2.21	Thus they reasoned, and they were led astray;
WIS.2.21	for their wickedness blinded them,
WIS.2.22	and they didn’t know the mysteries of God,
WIS.2.22	neither did they hope for wages of holiness,
WIS.2.22	nor did they discern that there is a prize for blameless souls.
WIS.2.23	Because God created man for incorruption,
WIS.2.23	and made him an image of his own everlastingness;
WIS.2.24	but death entered into the world by the envy of the devil,
WIS.2.24	and those who belong to him experience it.
WIS.3.1	But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God,
WIS.3.1	and no torment will touch them.
WIS.3.2	In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died.
WIS.3.2	Their departure was considered affliction,
WIS.3.3	and their travel away from us ruin;
WIS.3.3	But they are in peace.
WIS.3.4	For even if in the sight of men they are punished,
WIS.3.4	their hope is full of immortality.
WIS.3.5	Having borne a little chastening, they will receive great good;
WIS.3.5	because God tested them, and found them worthy of himself.
WIS.3.6	He tested them like gold in the furnace,
WIS.3.6	and he accepted them as a whole burnt offering.
WIS.3.7	In the time of their visitation they will shine.
WIS.3.7	They will run back and forth like sparks amongst stubble.
WIS.3.8	They will judge nations and have dominion over peoples.
WIS.3.8	The Lord will reign over them forever.
WIS.3.9	Those who trust him will understand truth.
WIS.3.9	because grace and mercy are with his chosen ones.
WIS.3.10	But the ungodly will be punished even as they reasoned,
WIS.3.10	those who neglected righteousness and revolted from the Lord;
WIS.3.11	for he who despises wisdom and discipline is miserable.
WIS.3.11	Their hope is void and their toils unprofitable.
WIS.3.11	Their works are useless.
WIS.3.12	Their wives are foolish and their children are wicked.
WIS.3.13	Their descendants are cursed,
WIS.3.13	because the barren woman who is undefiled is happy,
WIS.3.13	she who has not conceived in transgression.
WIS.3.13	She will have fruit in the visitation of souls.
WIS.3.14	So is the eunuch which has done no lawless deed with his hands,
WIS.3.14	nor imagined wicked things against the Lord;
WIS.3.14	for a precious gift will be given to him for his faithfulness, a special favour,
WIS.3.14	and a delightful inheritance in the Lord’s sanctuary.
WIS.3.15	For good labours have fruit of great renown.
WIS.3.15	The root of understanding can’t fail.
WIS.3.16	But children of adulterers will not come to maturity.
WIS.3.16	The seed of an unlawful bed will vanish away.
WIS.3.17	For if they live long, they will not be esteemed,
WIS.3.17	and in the end, their old age will be without honour.
WIS.3.18	If they die quickly, they will have no hope,
WIS.3.18	nor consolation in the day of decision.
WIS.3.19	For the end of an unrighteous generation is always grievous.
WIS.4.1	It is better to be childless with virtue,
WIS.4.1	for immortality is in the memory of virtue,
WIS.4.1	because it is recognised both before God and before men.
WIS.4.2	When it is present, people imitate it.
WIS.4.2	They long after it when it has departed.
WIS.4.2	victorious in the competition for the prizes that are undefiled.
WIS.4.3	But the multiplying brood of the ungodly will be of no profit,
WIS.4.3	and their illegitimate offshoots won’t take deep root,
WIS.4.3	nor will they establish a sure hold.
WIS.4.4	For even if they grow branches and flourish for a season,
WIS.4.4	standing unsure, they will be shaken by the wind.
WIS.4.4	They will be uprooted by the violence of winds.
WIS.4.5	Their branches will be broken off before they come to maturity.
WIS.4.5	Their fruit will be useless,
WIS.4.5	never ripe to eat, and fit for nothing.
WIS.4.6	For unlawfully conceived children are witnesses of wickedness
WIS.4.6	against parents when they are investigated.
WIS.4.7	But a righteous man, even if he dies before his time, will be at rest.
WIS.4.8	For honourable old age is not that which stands in length of time,
WIS.4.8	nor is its measure given by number of years:
WIS.4.9	But understanding is grey hair to men,
WIS.4.9	and an unspotted life is ripe old age.
WIS.4.10	Being found well-pleasing to God, he was loved.
WIS.4.10	While living amongst sinners he was transported.
WIS.4.11	He was caught away, lest evil should change his understanding,
WIS.4.11	or guile deceive his soul.
WIS.4.12	For the witchcraft of worthlessness obscures the things which are good,
WIS.4.12	and the whirl of desire perverts an innocent mind.
WIS.4.13	Being made perfect quickly,
WIS.4.13	he filled a long time;
WIS.4.14	for his soul was pleasing to the Lord.
WIS.4.14	Therefore he hurried out of the midst of wickedness.
WIS.4.15	But as for the peoples seeing and not understanding,
WIS.4.15	not considering this, that grace and mercy are with his chosen,
WIS.4.15	and that he visits his holy ones—
WIS.4.16	but a righteous man who is dead will condemn the ungodly who are living,
WIS.4.16	and youth that is quickly perfected will condemn the many years of an unrighteous man’s old age.
WIS.4.17	For the ungodly will see a wise man’s end,
WIS.4.17	and won’t understand what the Lord planned for him,
WIS.4.17	and why he safely kept him.
WIS.4.18	They will see, and they will despise;
WIS.4.18	but the Lord will laugh them to scorn.
WIS.4.18	After this, they will become a dishonoured carcass
WIS.4.18	and a reproach amongst the dead forever;
WIS.4.19	because he will dash them speechless to the ground,
WIS.4.19	and will shake them from the foundations.
WIS.4.19	They will lie utterly waste.
WIS.4.19	They will be in anguish
WIS.4.19	and their memory will perish.
WIS.4.20	They will come with coward fear when their sins are counted.
WIS.4.20	Their lawless deeds will convict them to their face.
WIS.5.1	Then the righteous man will stand in great boldness
WIS.5.1	before the face of those who afflicted him,
WIS.5.1	and those who make his labours of no account.
WIS.5.2	When they see him, they will be troubled with terrible fear,
WIS.5.2	and will be amazed at the marvel of salvation.
WIS.5.3	They will speak amongst themselves repenting,
WIS.5.3	and for distress of spirit they will groan,
WIS.5.3	“This was he whom we used to hold in derision,
WIS.5.3	as a parable of reproach.
WIS.5.4	We fools considered his life madness,
WIS.5.4	and his end without honour.
WIS.5.5	How was he counted amongst sons of God?
WIS.5.5	How is his lot amongst saints?
WIS.5.6	Truly we went astray from the way of truth.
WIS.5.6	The light of righteousness didn’t shine for us.
WIS.5.6	The sun didn’t rise for us.
WIS.5.7	We
WIS.5.7	We travelled through trackless deserts,
WIS.5.7	but we didn’t know the Lord’s way.
WIS.5.8	What did our arrogance profit us?
WIS.5.8	What good have riches and boasting brought us?
WIS.5.9	Those things all passed away as a shadow,
WIS.5.9	like a message that runs by,
WIS.5.10	like a ship passing through the billowy water,
WIS.5.10	which, when it has gone by, there is no trace to be found,
WIS.5.10	no pathway of its keel in the billows.
WIS.5.11	Or it is like when a bird flies through the air,
WIS.5.11	no evidence of its passage is found,
WIS.5.11	but the light wind, lashed with the stroke of its pinions,
WIS.5.11	and torn apart with the violent rush of the moving wings, is passed through.
WIS.5.11	Afterwards no sign of its coming remains.
WIS.5.12	Or it is like when an arrow is shot at a mark,
WIS.5.12	the air disparted closes up again immediately,
WIS.5.12	so that men don’t know where it passed through.
WIS.5.13	So we also, as soon as we were born, ceased to be;
WIS.5.13	and we had no sign of virtue to show,
WIS.5.13	but we were utterly consumed in our wickedness.”
WIS.5.14	Because the hope of the ungodly man is like chaff carried by the wind,
WIS.5.14	and
WIS.5.14	and is scattered like smoke by the wind,
WIS.5.14	and passes by as the remembrance of a guest that waits but a day.
WIS.5.15	But the righteous live forever.
WIS.5.15	Their reward is in the Lord,
WIS.5.15	and the care for them with the Most High.
WIS.5.16	Therefore they will receive the crown of royal dignity
WIS.5.16	and the diadem of beauty from the Lord’s hand;
WIS.5.16	because he will cover them with his right hand,
WIS.5.16	and he will shield them with his arm.
WIS.5.17	He will take his jealousy as complete armour,
WIS.5.17	and will make the whole creation his weapons to punish his enemies:
WIS.5.18	He will put on righteousness as a breastplate,
WIS.5.18	and will wear impartial judgement as a helmet.
WIS.5.19	He will take holiness as an invincible shield.
WIS.5.20	He will sharpen stern wrath for a sword.
WIS.5.20	The world will go with him to fight against his frenzied foes.
WIS.5.21	Shafts of lightning will fly with true aim.
WIS.5.21	They will leap to the mark from the clouds, as from a well-drawn bow.
WIS.5.22	Hailstones full of wrath will be hurled from an engine of war.
WIS.5.22	The water of the sea will be angered against them.
WIS.5.22	Rivers will sternly overwhelm them.
WIS.5.23	A mighty blast will encounter them.
WIS.5.23	It will winnow them away like a tempest.
WIS.5.23	So lawlessness will make all the land desolate.
WIS.5.23	Their evil-doing will overturn the thrones of princes.
WIS.6.1	Hear therefore, you kings, and understand.
WIS.6.1	Learn, you judges of the ends of the earth.
WIS.6.2	Give ear, you rulers who have dominion over many people,
WIS.6.2	and make your boast
WIS.6.3	because your dominion was given to you from the Lord,
WIS.6.3	and your sovereignty from the Most High.
WIS.6.3	He will search out your works,
WIS.6.3	and will enquire about your plans;
WIS.6.4	because being officers of his kingdom, you didn’t judge rightly,
WIS.6.4	nor did you keep
WIS.6.4	nor did you walk according to God’s counsel.
WIS.6.5	He will come upon you awfully and swiftly,
WIS.6.5	because a stern judgement comes on those who are in high places.
WIS.6.6	For the man of low estate may be pardoned in mercy,
WIS.6.6	but mighty men will be mightily tested.
WIS.6.7	For the Sovereign Lord of all will not be impressed with anyone,
WIS.6.7	neither will he show deference to greatness;
WIS.6.7	because it is he who made both small and great,
WIS.6.7	and cares about them all;
WIS.6.8	but the scrutiny that comes upon the powerful is strict.
WIS.6.9	Therefore, my words are to you, O princes,
WIS.6.9	that you may learn wisdom and not fall away.
WIS.6.10	For those who have kept the things that are holy in holiness will be made holy.
WIS.6.10	Those who have been taught them will find what to say in defence.
WIS.6.11	Therefore set your desire on my words.
WIS.6.11	Long for them, and you princes will be instructed.
WIS.6.12	Wisdom is radiant and doesn’t fade away;
WIS.6.12	and is easily seen by those who love her,
WIS.6.12	and found by those who seek her.
WIS.6.13	She anticipates those who desire her, making herself known.
WIS.6.14	He who rises up early to seek her won’t have difficulty,
WIS.6.14	for he will find her sitting at his gates.
WIS.6.15	For to think upon her is perfection of understanding,
WIS.6.15	and he who watches for her will quickly be free from care;
WIS.6.16	because she herself goes around, seeking those who are worthy of her,
WIS.6.16	and in their paths she appears to them graciously,
WIS.6.16	and in every purpose she meets them.
WIS.6.17	For her true beginning is desire for instruction;
WIS.6.17	and desire for instruction is love.
WIS.6.18	And love is observance of her laws.
WIS.6.18	To give heed to her laws confirms immortality.
WIS.6.19	Immortality brings closeness to God.
WIS.6.20	So then desire for wisdom promotes to a kingdom.
WIS.6.21	If therefore you delight in thrones and sceptres, you princes of peoples,
WIS.6.21	honour wisdom, that you may reign forever.
WIS.6.22	But what wisdom is, and how she came into being, I will declare.
WIS.6.22	I won’t hide mysteries from you;
WIS.6.22	but I will explore from her first beginning,
WIS.6.22	bring the knowledge of her into clear light,
WIS.6.22	and I will not pass by the truth.
WIS.6.23	Indeed, I won’t go with consuming envy,
WIS.6.23	because envy will have no fellowship with wisdom.
WIS.6.24	But a multitude of wise men is salvation to the world,
WIS.6.24	and an understanding king is stability for his people.
WIS.6.25	Therefore be instructed by my words, and you will profit.
WIS.7.1	I myself am also
WIS.7.1	and am a descendant of one formed first and born of the earth.
WIS.7.2	I moulded into flesh in the time of ten months in my mother’s womb,
WIS.7.2	being compacted in blood from the seed of man and pleasure that came with sleep.
WIS.7.3	I also, when I was born, drew in the common air,
WIS.7.3	and fell upon the kindred earth,
WIS.7.3	uttering, like all, for my first voice, the same cry.
WIS.7.4	I was nursed with care in swaddling clothes.
WIS.7.5	For no king had any other first beginning;
WIS.7.6	but all men have one entrance into life, and a common departure.
WIS.7.7	For this cause I prayed, and understanding was given to me.
WIS.7.7	I asked, and a spirit of wisdom came to me.
WIS.7.8	I preferred her before sceptres and thrones.
WIS.7.8	I considered riches nothing in comparison to her.
WIS.7.9	Neither did I liken to her any priceless gem,
WIS.7.9	because all gold in her presence is a little sand,
WIS.7.9	and silver will be considered as clay before her.
WIS.7.10	I loved her more than health and beauty,
WIS.7.10	and I chose to have her rather than light,
WIS.7.10	because her bright shining is never laid to sleep.
WIS.7.11	All good things came to me with her,
WIS.7.11	and innumerable riches are in her hands.
WIS.7.12	And I rejoiced over them all because wisdom leads them;
WIS.7.12	although I didn’t know that she was their mother.
WIS.7.13	As I learnt without guile, I impart without grudging.
WIS.7.13	I don’t hide her riches.
WIS.7.14	For she is a treasure for men that doesn’t fail,
WIS.7.14	and those who use it obtain friendship with God,
WIS.7.14	commended by the gifts which they present through discipline.
WIS.7.15	But may God grant that I may speak his judgement,
WIS.7.15	and to conceive thoughts worthy of what has been given me;
WIS.7.15	because he is one who guides even wisdom and who corrects the wise.
WIS.7.16	For both we and our words are in his hand,
WIS.7.16	with all understanding and skill in various crafts.
WIS.7.17	For he himself gave me an unerring knowledge of the things that are,
WIS.7.17	to know the structure of the universe and the operation of the elements;
WIS.7.18	the beginning, end, and middle of times;
WIS.7.18	the alternations of the solstices and the changes of seasons;
WIS.7.19	the circuits of years and the positions of stars;
WIS.7.20	the natures of living creatures and the raging of wild beasts;
WIS.7.20	The violence of
WIS.7.20	the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots.
WIS.7.21	All things that are either secret or manifest I learnt,
WIS.7.22	for wisdom, that is the architect of all things, taught me.
WIS.7.22	For there is in her a spirit that is quick to understand, holy,
WIS.7.22	unique, manifold, subtle, freely moving, clear in utterance, unpolluted,
WIS.7.22	distinct, unharmed, loving what is good, keen, unhindered,
WIS.7.23	beneficent, loving towards man, steadfast, sure, free from care, all-powerful, all-surveying,
WIS.7.23	and penetrating through all spirits that are quick to understand, pure, most subtle:
WIS.7.24	For wisdom is more mobile than any motion.
WIS.7.24	Yes, she pervades and penetrates all things by reason of her purity.
WIS.7.25	For she is a breath of the power of God,
WIS.7.25	and a clear effluence of the glory of the Almighty.
WIS.7.25	Therefore nothing defiled can find entrance into her.
WIS.7.26	For she is a reflection of everlasting light,
WIS.7.26	an unspotted mirror of the working of God,
WIS.7.26	and an image of his goodness.
WIS.7.27	She, being one, has power to do all things.
WIS.7.27	Remaining in herself, she renews all things.
WIS.7.27	From generation to generation passing into holy souls,
WIS.7.27	she makes friends of God and prophets.
WIS.7.28	For God loves nothing as much as one who dwells with wisdom.
WIS.7.29	For she is fairer than the sun,
WIS.7.29	and above all the constellations of the stars.
WIS.7.29	She is better than light.
WIS.7.30	For daylight yields to night,
WIS.7.30	but evil does not prevail against wisdom.
WIS.8.1	But she reaches from one end to the other with full strength,
WIS.8.1	and orders all things well.
WIS.8.2	I loved her and sought her from my youth.
WIS.8.2	I sought to take her for my bride.
WIS.8.2	I became enamoured by her beauty.
WIS.8.3	She glorifies her noble birth by living with God.
WIS.8.3	The Sovereign Lord of all loves her.
WIS.8.4	For she is initiated into the knowledge of God,
WIS.8.4	and she chooses his works.
WIS.8.5	But if riches are a desired possession in life,
WIS.8.5	what is richer than wisdom, which makes all things?
WIS.8.6	And if understanding works,
WIS.8.6	who more than
WIS.8.7	If a man loves righteousness,
WIS.8.7	for she teaches soberness, understanding, righteousness, and courage.
WIS.8.7	There is nothing in life more profitable for people than these.
WIS.8.8	And if anyone longs for wide experience,
WIS.8.8	she knows the things of old, and infers the things to come.
WIS.8.8	She understands subtleties of speeches and interpretations of dark sayings.
WIS.8.8	She foresees signs and wonders, and the issues of seasons and times.
WIS.8.9	Therefore I determined to take her to live with me,
WIS.8.9	knowing that she is one who would give me good counsel,
WIS.8.9	and encourage me in cares and grief.
WIS.8.10	Because of her, I will have glory amongst multitudes,
WIS.8.10	and honour in the sight of elders, though I am young.
WIS.8.11	I will be found keen when I give judgement.
WIS.8.11	I will be admired in the presence of rulers.
WIS.8.12	When I am silent, they will wait for me.
WIS.8.12	When I open my lips, they will heed what I say.
WIS.8.12	If I continue speaking, they will put their hands on their mouths.
WIS.8.13	Because of her, I will have immortality,
WIS.8.13	and leave behind an eternal memory to those who come after me.
WIS.8.14	I will govern peoples.
WIS.8.14	Nations will be subjected to me.
WIS.8.15	Dreaded monarchs will fear me when they hear of me.
WIS.8.15	Amongst the people, I will show myself to be good, and courageous in war.
WIS.8.16	When I come into my house, I will find rest with her.
WIS.8.16	For conversation with her has no bitterness,
WIS.8.16	and living with her has no pain, but gladness and joy.
WIS.8.17	When I considered these things in myself,
WIS.8.17	and thought in my heart how immortality is in kinship to wisdom,
WIS.8.18	and in her friendship is good delight,
WIS.8.18	and in the labours of her hands is wealth that doesn’t fail,
WIS.8.18	and understanding is in her companionship,
WIS.8.18	and great renown in having fellowship with her words,
WIS.8.18	I went about seeking how to take her to myself.
WIS.8.19	Now I was a clever child, and received a good soul.
WIS.8.20	Or rather, being good, I came into an undefiled body.
WIS.8.21	But perceiving that I could not otherwise possess wisdom unless God gave her to me—
WIS.8.21	yes, and to know and understand by whom the grace is given—
WIS.8.21	I pleaded with the Lord and implored him, and with my whole heart I said,
WIS.9.1	“O God of the fathers, and Lord of mercy,
WIS.9.1	who made all things by your word;
WIS.9.2	and by your wisdom you formed man,
WIS.9.2	that he should have dominion over the creatures that were made by you,
WIS.9.3	and rule the world in holiness and righteousness,
WIS.9.3	and execute judgement in uprightness of soul;
WIS.9.4	give me wisdom, her who sits by you on your thrones.
WIS.9.4	Don’t reject me from amongst your
WIS.9.5	because I am your servant and the son of your handmaid,
WIS.9.5	a weak and short-lived man,
WIS.9.5	with little power to understand judgement and laws.
WIS.9.6	For even if a man is perfect amongst the sons of men,
WIS.9.6	if the wisdom that comes from you is not with him, he will count for nothing.
WIS.9.7	You chose me to be king of your people,
WIS.9.7	and a judge for your sons and daughters.
WIS.9.8	You gave a command to build a sanctuary on your holy mountain,
WIS.9.8	and
WIS.9.8	a copy of the holy tent which you prepared from the beginning.
WIS.9.9	Wisdom is with you and knows your works,
WIS.9.9	and was present when you were making the world,
WIS.9.9	and understands what is pleasing in your eyes,
WIS.9.9	and what is right according to your commandments.
WIS.9.10	Send her from the holy heavens,
WIS.9.10	and ask her to come from the throne of your glory,
WIS.9.10	that being present with me she may work,
WIS.9.10	and I may learn what pleases you well.
WIS.9.11	For she knows all things and understands,
WIS.9.11	and she will guide me soberly in my actions.
WIS.9.11	She will guard me in her glory.
WIS.9.12	So my works will be acceptible.
WIS.9.12	I will judge your people righteously,
WIS.9.12	and I will be worthy of my father’s
WIS.9.13	For what man will know the counsel of God?
WIS.9.13	Or who will conceive what the Lord wills?
WIS.9.14	For the thoughts of mortals are unstable,
WIS.9.14	and our plans are prone to fail.
WIS.9.15	For a corruptible body weighs down the soul.
WIS.9.15	The earthy frame lies heavy on a mind that is full of cares.
WIS.9.16	We can hardly guess the things that are on earth,
WIS.9.16	and we find the things that are close at hand with labour;
WIS.9.16	but who has traced out the things that are in the heavens?
WIS.9.17	Who gained knowledge of your counsel, unless you gave wisdom,
WIS.9.17	and sent your holy spirit from the highest?
WIS.9.18	It was thus that the ways of those who are on earth were corrected,
WIS.9.18	and men were taught the things that are pleasing to you.
WIS.9.18	They were saved through wisdom.”
WIS.10.1	and delivered him out of his own transgression,
WIS.10.2	and gave him strength to get dominion over all things.
WIS.10.3	But when an unrighteous man fell away from her in his anger,
WIS.10.3	he perished himself in the rage wherewith he killed his brother.
WIS.10.4	When for his cause the earth was drowning with a flood,
WIS.10.4	Wisdom again saved it,
WIS.10.4	guiding the righteous man’s course by a poor piece of wood.
WIS.10.5	Moreover, when nations consenting together in wickedness had been confounded,
WIS.10.5	and kept him strong when his heart yearned towards his child.
WIS.10.6	While the ungodly were perishing, 
WIS.10.6	when he fled from the fire that descended out of heaven on
WIS.10.7	To whose wickedness a smoking waste still witnesses,
WIS.10.7	and plants bearing fair fruit that doesn’t ripen,
WIS.10.7	a disbelieving soul has a memorial: a standing pillar of salt.
WIS.10.8	For having passed wisdom by,
WIS.10.8	not only were they disabled from recognising the things which are good,
WIS.10.8	but they also left behind them for their life a monument of their folly,
WIS.10.8	to the end that where they stumbled, they might fail even to be unseen;
WIS.10.9	but wisdom delivered those who waited on her out of troubles.
WIS.10.10	When a righteous man was a fugitive from a brother’s wrath,
WIS.10.10	She showed him God’s kingdom, and gave him knowledge of holy things.
WIS.10.10	She prospered him in his toils, and multiplied the fruits of his labour.
WIS.10.11	When in their covetousness men dealt harshly with him,
WIS.10.11	she stood by him and made him rich.
WIS.10.12	She guarded him from enemies,
WIS.10.12	and she kept him safe from those who lay in wait.
WIS.10.12	Over his severe conflict, she watched as judge,
WIS.10.12	that he might know that godliness is more powerful than every one.
WIS.10.13	When a righteous man was sold,
WIS.10.13	but she delivered him from sin.
WIS.10.13	She went down with him into a dungeon,
WIS.10.14	and in bonds she didn’t depart from him,
WIS.10.14	until she brought him the sceptre of a kingdom,
WIS.10.14	and authority over those that dealt tyrannously with him.
WIS.10.14	She also showed those who had mockingly accused him to be false,
WIS.10.14	and gave him eternal glory.
WIS.10.16	She entered into the soul of a servant of the Lord,
WIS.10.16	and withstood terrible kings in wonders and signs.
WIS.10.17	She rendered to holy men a reward of their toils.
WIS.10.17	She guided them along a marvellous way,
WIS.10.17	and became to them a covering in the day-time,
WIS.10.17	and a flame of stars through the night.
WIS.10.18	She brought them over the Red sea,
WIS.10.18	and led them through much water;
WIS.10.19	but she drowned their enemies,
WIS.10.19	and she cast them up from the bottom of the deep.
WIS.10.20	Therefore the righteous plundered the ungodly,
WIS.10.20	and they sang praise to your holy name, O Lord,
WIS.10.20	and extolled with one accord your hand that fought for them,
WIS.10.21	because wisdom opened the mouth of the mute,
WIS.10.21	and made the tongues of babes to speak clearly.
WIS.11.1	She prospered their works in the hand of a holy prophet.
WIS.11.2	They travelled through a desert without inhabitant,
WIS.11.2	and they pitched their tents in trackless regions.
WIS.11.3	They withstood enemies and repelled foes.
WIS.11.4	They thirsted, and they called upon you,
WIS.11.4	and water was given to them out of the
WIS.11.4	and healing of their thirst out of the hard stone.
WIS.11.5	For by what things their foes were punished,
WIS.11.5	by these they in their need were benefitted.
WIS.11.6	When enemies were troubled with clotted blood
WIS.11.6	instead of a river’s ever-flowing fountain,
WIS.11.7	to rebuke the decree for the slaying of babies,
WIS.11.7	you gave them abundant water beyond all hope,
WIS.11.8	having shown by the thirst which they had suffered
WIS.11.8	how you punished the adversaries.
WIS.11.9	For when they were tried, although chastened in mercy,
WIS.11.9	they learnt how the ungodly were tormented, being judged with wrath.
WIS.11.10	For you tested these as a father admonishing them;
WIS.11.10	but you searched out those as a stern king condemning them.
WIS.11.11	Yes and whether they were far off or near,
WIS.11.11	they were equally distressed;
WIS.11.12	for a double grief seized them,
WIS.11.12	and a groaning at the memory of things past.
WIS.11.13	For when they heard that through their own punishments the others benefitted,
WIS.11.13	they recognised the Lord.
WIS.11.14	For him who long before was thrown out and exposed they stopped mocking.
WIS.11.14	In the end of what happened, they marvelled,
WIS.11.14	having thirsted in another manner than the righteous.
WIS.11.15	But in return for the senseless imaginings of their unrighteousness,
WIS.11.15	wherein they were led astray to worship irrational reptiles and wretched vermin,
WIS.11.15	you sent upon them a multitude of irrational creatures for vengeance;
WIS.11.16	that they might learn that by what things a man sins, by these he is punished.
WIS.11.17	For your all-powerful hand
WIS.11.17	that created the world out of formless matter
WIS.11.17	didn’t lack means to send upon them a multitude of bears, fierce lions,
WIS.11.18	or newly-created and unknown wild beasts, full of rage,
WIS.11.18	either breathing out a blast of fiery breath,
WIS.11.18	or belching out smoke,
WIS.11.18	or flashing dreadful sparks from their eyes;
WIS.11.19	which had power not only to consume them by their violence,
WIS.11.19	but to destroy them even by the terror of their sight.
WIS.11.20	Yes and without these they might have fallen by a single breath,
WIS.11.20	being pursued by Justice, and scattered abroad by the breath of your power;
WIS.11.20	but you arranged all things by measure, number, and weight.
WIS.11.21	For to be greatly strong is yours at all times.
WIS.11.21	Who could withstand the might of your arm?
WIS.11.22	Because the whole world before you is as a grain in a balance,
WIS.11.22	and as a drop of dew that comes down upon the earth in the morning.
WIS.11.23	But you have mercy on all men, because you have power to do all things,
WIS.11.23	and you overlook the sins of men to the end that they may repent.
WIS.11.24	For you love all things that are,
WIS.11.24	and abhor none of the things which you made;
WIS.11.24	For you never would have formed anything if you hated it.
WIS.11.25	How would anything have endured unless you had willed it?
WIS.11.25	Or that which was not called by you, how would it have been preserved?
WIS.11.26	But you spare all things, because they are yours,
WIS.11.26	O Sovereign Lord, you lover of lives.
WIS.12.1	For your incorruptible spirit is in all things.
WIS.12.2	Wherefore you convict little by little those who fall from the right way,
WIS.12.2	and, putting them in remembrance by the things wherein they sin, you admonish them,
WIS.12.2	that escaping from their wickedness they may believe in you, O Lord.
WIS.12.3	For truly the old inhabitants of your holy land,
WIS.12.4	hating them because they practised detestable works of enchantments and unholy rites—
WIS.12.5	and sacrificial banquets of men’s flesh and of blood—
WIS.12.6	allies in an impious fellowship,
WIS.12.6	and murderers of their own helpless babes,
WIS.12.6	it was your counsel to destroy by the hands of our fathers;
WIS.12.7	that the land which in your sight is most precious of all
WIS.12.7	might receive a worthy colony of God’s servants.
WIS.12.8	Nevertheless you even spared these as men,
WIS.12.8	and you sent hornets
WIS.12.8	to cause them to perish little by little;
WIS.12.9	Not that you were unable to subdue the ungodly under the hand of the righteous in battle,
WIS.12.9	or by terrible beasts or by a stern word to make away with them at once;
WIS.12.10	but judging them little by little you gave them a chance to repent,
WIS.12.10	not being ignorant that their nature by birth was evil,
WIS.12.10	their wickedness inborn,
WIS.12.10	and that their manner of thought would never be changed.
WIS.12.11	For they were a cursed seed from the beginning.
WIS.12.11	It wasn’t through fear of any that you left them unpunished for their sins.
WIS.12.12	For who will say, “What have you done?”
WIS.12.12	Or “Who will withstand your judgement?”
WIS.12.12	Who will accuse you for the perishing of nations which you caused?
WIS.12.12	Or who will come and stand before you as an avenger for unrighteous men?
WIS.12.13	For there isn’t any God beside you that cares for all,
WIS.12.13	that you might show that you didn’t judge unrighteously.
WIS.12.14	No king or prince will be able to look you in the face
WIS.12.14	for those whom you have punished.
WIS.12.15	But being righteous, you rule all things righteously,
WIS.12.15	deeming it a thing alien from your power
WIS.12.15	to condemn one that does not deserve to be punished.
WIS.12.16	For your strength is the beginning of righteousness,
WIS.12.16	and your sovereignty over all makes you to forbear all.
WIS.12.17	For when men don’t believe that you are perfect in power, you show your strength,
WIS.12.18	But you, being sovereign over strength, judge in gentleness,
WIS.12.18	and with great forbearance do you govern us;
WIS.12.18	for the power is yours whenever you desire it.
WIS.12.19	But you taught your people by such works as these,
WIS.12.19	how the righteous must be a lover of men.
WIS.12.19	You made your sons to have good hope,
WIS.12.19	because you give repentance when men have sinned.
WIS.12.20	For if on those who were enemies of your servants
WIS.12.20	you took vengeance with so great deliberation and indulgence,
WIS.12.20	giving them times and opportunities when they might escape from their wickedness;
WIS.12.21	with how great carefulness you judged your sons,
WIS.12.21	to whose fathers you gave oaths and covenants of good promises!
WIS.12.22	Therefore while you chasten us, you scourge our enemies ten thousand times more,
WIS.12.22	to the intent that we may ponder your goodness when we judge,
WIS.12.22	and when we are judged may look for mercy.
WIS.12.23	Wherefore also the unrighteous that lived in folly of life,
WIS.12.23	you tormented through their own abominations.
WIS.12.24	For truly they went astray very far in the ways of error,
WIS.12.24	Taking as gods those animals
WIS.12.24	deceived like foolish babes.
WIS.12.25	Therefore, as to unreasoning children, you sent your judgement to mock them.
WIS.12.26	But those who would not be admonished by a mocking correction as of children
WIS.12.26	will experience a judgement worthy of God.
WIS.12.27	For through the sufferings they were indignant of,
WIS.12.27	being punished in these creatures which they supposed to be gods,
WIS.12.27	they saw and recognised as the true God him whom they refused to know.
WIS.12.27	Therefore also the result of condemnation came upon them.
WIS.13.1	For truly all men who had no perception of God were vain by nature,
WIS.13.1	and didn’t gain power to know him who exists from the good things that are seen.
WIS.13.1	They didn’t recognise the architect from his works.
WIS.13.2	But they thought that either fire, or wind, or swift air,
WIS.13.2	or circling stars, or raging water, or luminaries of heaven
WIS.13.2	were gods that rule the world.
WIS.13.3	If it was through delight in their beauty that they took them to be gods,
WIS.13.3	let them know how much better their Sovereign Lord is than these,
WIS.13.3	for the first author of beauty created them.
WIS.13.4	But if it was through astonishment at their power and influence,
WIS.13.4	then let them understand from them how much more powerful he who formed them is.
WIS.13.5	For from the greatness of the beauty of created things,
WIS.13.5	mankind forms the corresponding image of their Maker.
WIS.13.6	But yet for these men there is but small blame,
WIS.13.6	for they too perhaps go astray
WIS.13.6	while they are seeking God and desiring to find him.
WIS.13.7	For they diligently search while living amongst his works,
WIS.13.7	and they trust their sight that the things that they look at are beautiful.
WIS.13.8	But again even they are not to be excused.
WIS.13.9	For if they had power to know so much,
WIS.13.9	that they should be able to explore the world,
WIS.13.9	how is it that they didn’t find the Sovereign Lord sooner?
WIS.13.10	But miserable
WIS.13.10	Who called them gods which are works of men’s hands,
WIS.13.10	gold and silver, skilfully made, and likenesses of animals,
WIS.13.10	or a useless stone, the work of an ancient hand.
WIS.13.11	Yes and if some
WIS.13.11	skilfully strips away all its bark,
WIS.13.11	and fashioning it in attractive form, makes a useful vessel to serve his life’s needs.
WIS.13.12	Burning the scraps from his handiwork to cook his food,
WIS.13.12	he eats his fill.
WIS.13.13	Taking a discarded scrap which served no purpose,
WIS.13.13	a crooked piece of wood and full of knots,
WIS.13.13	carves it with the diligence of his idleness,
WIS.13.13	and shapes it by the skill of his
WIS.13.13	He shapes it in the image of a man,
WIS.13.14	or makes it like some paltry animal,
WIS.13.14	smearing it with something red, painting it red,
WIS.13.14	and smearing over every stain in it.
WIS.13.15	Having made a worthy chamber for it,
WIS.13.15	he sets it in a wall, securing it with iron.
WIS.13.16	He plans for it that it may not fall down,
WIS.13.16	knowing that it is unable to help itself
WIS.13.16	(for truly it is an image, and needs help).
WIS.13.17	When he makes his prayer concerning goods and his marriage and children,
WIS.13.17	he is not ashamed to speak to that which has no life.
WIS.13.18	Yes, for health, he calls upon that which is weak.
WIS.13.18	For life, he implores that which is dead.
WIS.13.18	For aid, he supplicates that which has no experience.
WIS.13.18	For a good journey, he asks that which can’t so much as move a step.
WIS.13.19	And for profit in business and good success of his hands,
WIS.13.19	he asks ability from that which has hands with no ability.
WIS.14.1	Again, one preparing to sail, and about to journey over raging waves,
WIS.14.1	calls upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carries him.
WIS.14.2	For the hunger for profit planned it,
WIS.14.2	and wisdom was the craftsman who built it.
WIS.14.3	Your providence, O Father, guides it along,
WIS.14.3	because even in the sea you gave a way,
WIS.14.3	and in the waves a sure path,
WIS.14.4	showing that you can save out of every danger,
WIS.14.4	that even a man without skill may put to sea.
WIS.14.5	It is your will that the works of your wisdom should be not idle.
WIS.14.5	Therefore men also entrust their lives to a little piece of wood,
WIS.14.5	and passing through the surge on a raft come safely to land.
WIS.14.6	For
WIS.14.6	the hope of the world, taking refuge on a raft,
WIS.14.6	your hand guided the seed of generations of the race of men.
WIS.14.7	For blessed is wood through which comes righteousness;
WIS.14.8	but the idol made with hands is accursed, itself and he that made it;
WIS.14.8	because his was the working, and the corruptible thing was called a god:
WIS.14.9	For both the ungodly and his ungodliness are alike hateful to God;
WIS.14.10	for truly the deed will be punished together with him who committed it.
WIS.14.11	Therefore also there will be a visitation amongst the idols of the nation,
WIS.14.11	because, though formed of things which God created, they were made an abomination,
WIS.14.11	stumbling blocks to the souls of men,
WIS.14.11	and a snare to the feet of the foolish.
WIS.14.12	For the devising of idols was the beginning of fornication,
WIS.14.12	and the invention of them the corruption of life.
WIS.14.13	For they didn’t exist from the beginning, and they won’t exist forever.
WIS.14.14	For by the vaingloriousness of men they entered into the world,
WIS.14.14	and therefore a speedy end was planned for them.
WIS.14.15	For a father worn with untimely grief,
WIS.14.15	making an image of the child quickly taken away,
WIS.14.15	now honoured him as a god which was then a dead man,
WIS.14.15	and delivered to those that were under him mysteries and solemn rites.
WIS.14.16	Afterward the ungodly custom, in process of time grown strong, was kept as a law,
WIS.14.16	and the engraved images received worship by the commandments of princes.
WIS.14.17	And when men could not honour them in presence because they lived far off,
WIS.14.17	imagining the likeness from afar,
WIS.14.17	they made a visible image of the king whom they honoured,
WIS.14.17	that by their zeal they might flatter the absent as if present.
WIS.14.18	But worship was raised to a yet higher pitch, even by those who didn’t know him,
WIS.14.18	urged forward by the ambition of the architect;
WIS.14.19	for he, wishing perhaps to please one in authority,
WIS.14.19	used his art to force the likeness towards a greater beauty.
WIS.14.20	So the multitude, allured by reason of the grace of his handiwork,
WIS.14.20	now consider an object of devotion him that a little before was honoured as a man.
WIS.14.21	And this became an ambush,
WIS.14.21	because men, in bondage either to calamity or to tyranny,
WIS.14.21	invested stones and stocks with the incommunicable Name.
WIS.14.22	Afterward it was not enough for them to go astray concerning the knowledge of God,
WIS.14.22	but also, while they live in a great war of ignorance, they call a multitude of evils peace.
WIS.14.23	For either slaughtering children in solemn rites, or celebrating secret mysteries,
WIS.14.23	or holding frantic revels of strange ordinances,
WIS.14.24	no longer do they guard either life or purity of marriage,
WIS.14.24	but one brings upon another either death by treachery, or anguish by adultery.
WIS.14.25	And all things confusedly are filled with blood and murder, theft and deceit,
WIS.14.25	corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury,
WIS.14.26	confusion about what is good, forgetfulness of favours,
WIS.14.26	ingratitude for benefits,
WIS.14.26	defiling of souls, confusion of sex,
WIS.14.26	disorder in marriage, adultery and wantonness.
WIS.14.27	For the worship of idols that may not be named 
WIS.14.27	is a beginning and cause and end of every evil.
WIS.14.28	For their worshippers either make merry to madness, or prophesy lies,
WIS.14.28	or live unrighteously, or lightly commit perjury.
WIS.14.29	For putting their trust in lifeless idols,
WIS.14.29	when they have sworn a wicked oath, they expect not to suffer harm.
WIS.14.30	But for both, the just doom will pursue them,
WIS.14.30	because they had evil thoughts of God by giving heed to idols,
WIS.14.30	and swore unrighteously in deceit through contempt for holiness.
WIS.14.31	For it is not the power of them by whom men swear,
WIS.14.31	but it is the just penalty for those who sin
WIS.14.31	that always visits the transgression of the unrighteous.
WIS.15.1	But you, our God, are gracious and true,
WIS.15.1	patient, and in mercy ordering all things.
WIS.15.2	For even if we sin, we are yours, knowing your dominion;
WIS.15.2	but we will not sin, knowing that we have been accounted yours.
WIS.15.3	For to be acquainted with you is
WIS.15.3	and to know your dominion is the root of immortality.
WIS.15.4	For we weren’t led astray by any evil plan of men’s,
WIS.15.4	nor yet by painters’ fruitless labour,
WIS.15.4	a form stained with varied colours,
WIS.15.5	the sight of which leads fools into
WIS.15.5	Their desire is for the breathless form of a dead image.
WIS.15.6	Lovers of evil things, and worthy of such hopes,
WIS.15.6	are those who make, desire, and worship them.
WIS.15.7	For a potter, kneading soft earth,
WIS.15.7	laboriously moulds each article for our service.
WIS.15.7	He fashions out of the same clay
WIS.15.7	both the vessels that minister to clean uses, and those of a contrary sort,
WIS.15.7	all in like manner.
WIS.15.7	What shall be the use of each article of either sort,
WIS.15.7	the potter is the judge.
WIS.15.8	Also, labouring to an evil end, he moulds a vain god out of the same clay,
WIS.15.8	he who, having but a little before been made of earth,
WIS.15.8	after a short space goes his way to the earth out of which he was taken,
WIS.15.8	when he is required to render back the
WIS.15.9	However he has anxious care,
WIS.15.9	not because his powers must fail,
WIS.15.9	nor because his span of life is short;
WIS.15.9	But he compares himself with goldsmiths and silversmiths,
WIS.15.9	and he imitates molders in
WIS.15.9	and esteems it glory that he moulds counterfeits.
WIS.15.10	His heart is ashes.
WIS.15.10	His hope is of less value than earth.
WIS.15.10	His life is of less honour than clay;
WIS.15.11	because he was ignorant of him who moulded him,
WIS.15.11	and of him that inspired into him
WIS.15.11	and breathed into him a vital spirit.
WIS.15.12	But
WIS.15.12	and our
WIS.15.12	for, he says, one must get gain however one can, even if it is by evil.
WIS.15.13	For this man beyond all others knows that he sins,
WIS.15.13	out of earthy matter making brittle vessels and graven images.
WIS.15.14	But most foolish and more miserable than a baby,
WIS.15.14	are the enemies of your people, who oppressed them;
WIS.15.15	because they even considered all the idols of the nations to be gods,
WIS.15.15	which have neither the use of eyes for seeing,
WIS.15.15	nor nostrils for drawing breath,
WIS.15.15	nor ears to hear,
WIS.15.15	nor fingers for handling,
WIS.15.15	and their feet are helpless for walking.
WIS.15.16	For a man made them,
WIS.15.16	and one whose own spirit is borrowed moulded them;
WIS.15.16	for no one has power as a man to mould a god like to himself.
WIS.15.17	But, being mortal, he makes a dead thing by the work of lawless hands;
WIS.15.17	for he is better than the objects of his worship,
WIS.15.17	since he indeed had life, but they never did.
WIS.15.18	Yes, and they worship the creatures that are most hateful,
WIS.15.18	for, being compared as to lack of sense, these are worse than all others;
WIS.15.19	Neither, as seen beside other creatures, are they beautiful, so that one should desire them,
WIS.15.19	but they have escaped both the praise of God and his blessing.
WIS.16.1	For this cause, they were deservedly punished through creatures like those which they worship,
WIS.16.1	and tormented through a multitude of vermin.
WIS.16.2	Instead of this punishment, you, giving benefits to your people,
WIS.16.2	prepared quails for food,
WIS.16.2	a delicacy to satisfy the desire of their appetite,
WIS.16.3	to the end that your enemies, desiring food,
WIS.16.3	might for the hideousness of the creatures sent amongst them,
WIS.16.3	loathe even the necessary appetite;
WIS.16.3	but these, your people, having for a short time suffered lack,
WIS.16.3	might even partake of delicacies.
WIS.16.4	For it was necessary that inescapable lack should come upon those oppressors,
WIS.16.4	but that to these it should only be showed how their enemies were tormented.
WIS.16.5	For even when terrible raging of wild beasts came upon your people,
WIS.16.5	and they were perishing by the bites of crooked serpents,
WIS.16.5	your wrath didn’t continue to the uttermost;
WIS.16.6	but for admonition were they troubled for a short time,
WIS.16.6	having a token of salvation
WIS.16.6	to put them in remembrance of the commandment of your law;
WIS.16.7	for he who turned towards it was not saved because of that which was seen,
WIS.16.7	but because of you, the Saviour of all.
WIS.16.8	Yes, and in this you persuaded our enemies
WIS.16.8	that you are he who delivers out of every evil.
WIS.16.9	For the bites of locusts and flies truly killed them.
WIS.16.9	No healing for their life was found,
WIS.16.9	because they were worthy to be punished by such things.
WIS.16.10	But your children weren’t overcome by the very teeth of venomous dragons,
WIS.16.10	for your mercy passed by where they were and healed them.
WIS.16.11	For they were bitten to put them in remembrance of your oracles,
WIS.16.11	and were quickly saved, lest, falling into deep forgetfulness,
WIS.16.11	they should become unable to respond to your kindness.
WIS.16.12	For truly it was neither herb nor mollifying plaster that cured them,
WIS.16.12	but your word, O Lord, which heals all things.
WIS.16.13	For you have authority over life and death,
WIS.16.13	and you lead down to the gates of Hades, and lead up again.
WIS.16.14	But though a man kills by his wickedness,
WIS.16.14	he can’t retrieve the spirit that has departed
WIS.16.14	or release the imprisoned soul.
WIS.16.15	But it is not possible to escape your hand;
WIS.16.16	for ungodly men, refusing to know you, were scourged in the strength of your arm,
WIS.16.16	pursued with strange rains and hails and relentless storms,
WIS.16.16	and utterly consumed with fire.
WIS.16.17	For, what was most marvellous,
WIS.16.17	in the water which quenches all things, the fire burnt hotter;
WIS.16.17	for the world fights for the righteous.
WIS.16.18	For at one time the flame lost its fierceness,
WIS.16.18	that it might not burn up the creatures sent against the ungodly,
WIS.16.18	but that these themselves as they looked might see that they were chased through the judgement of God.
WIS.16.19	At another time even in the midst of water it burns above the power of fire,
WIS.16.19	that it may destroy the produce of an unrighteous land.
WIS.16.20	Instead of these things, you gave your people angels’ food to eat,
WIS.16.20	and you provided ready-to-eat bread for them from heaven without toil,
WIS.16.20	having the virtue of every pleasant flavour,
WIS.16.20	and agreeable to every taste.
WIS.16.21	For your nature showed your sweetness towards your children,
WIS.16.21	while that bread, serving the desire of the eater,
WIS.16.21	changed itself according to every man’s choice.
WIS.16.22	But snow and ice endured fire, and didn’t melt,
WIS.16.22	that people might know that fire was destroying the fruits of the enemies,
WIS.16.22	burning in the hail and flashing in the rains;
WIS.16.23	and that this fire again, in order that righteous people may be nourished,
WIS.16.23	has even forgotten its own power.
WIS.16.24	For the creation, ministering to you its maker,
WIS.16.24	strains its force against the unrighteous for punishment
WIS.16.24	and slackens it on behalf of those who trust in you, for kindness.
WIS.16.25	Therefore at that time also, converting itself into all forms,
WIS.16.25	it ministered to your all-nourishing bounty,
WIS.16.25	according to the desire of those who had need,
WIS.16.26	that your sons, whom you loved, O Lord, might learn
WIS.16.26	that it is not the growth of crops that nourishes a man,
WIS.16.26	but that your word preserves those who trust you.
WIS.16.27	For that which was not marred by fire,
WIS.16.27	when it was simply warmed by a faint sunbeam melted away,
WIS.16.28	that it might be known that we must rise before the sun to give you thanks,
WIS.16.28	and must plead with you at the dawning of the light;
WIS.16.29	for the hope of the unthankful will melt as the winter’s hoar frost,
WIS.16.29	and will flow away as water that has no use.
WIS.17.1	For your judgements are great, and hard to interpret;
WIS.17.1	therefore undisciplined souls went astray.
WIS.17.2	For when lawless men had supposed that they held a holy nation in their power,
WIS.17.2	they, prisoners of darkness, and bound in the fetters of a long night,
WIS.17.2	kept close beneath their roofs,
WIS.17.2	lay exiled from the eternal providence.
WIS.17.3	For while they thought that they were unseen in 
WIS.17.3	they were divided from one another by a dark curtain of forgetfulness,
WIS.17.3	stricken with terrible awe, and very troubled by apparitions.
WIS.17.4	For neither did the dark recesses that held them guard them from fears,
WIS.17.4	But terrifying sounds rang around them,
WIS.17.4	and dismal phantoms appeared with unsmiling faces.
WIS.17.5	And no force of fire prevailed to give light,
WIS.17.5	neither were the brightest flames of the stars strong enough to illuminate that gloomy night;
WIS.17.6	but only the glimmering of a self-kindled fire appeared to them, full of fear.
WIS.17.6	In terror, they considered the things which they saw
WIS.17.6	to be worse than that sight, on which they could not gaze.
WIS.17.7	The mockeries of their magic arts were powerless, now,
WIS.17.7	and a shameful rebuke of their boasted understanding:
WIS.17.8	For those who promised to drive away terrors and disorders from a sick soul,
WIS.17.8	these were sick with a ludicrous fearfulness.
WIS.17.9	For even if no troubling thing frighted them,
WIS.17.9	yet, scared with the creeping of vermin and hissing of serpents,
WIS.17.10	they perished trembling in fear,
WIS.17.10	refusing even to look at the air, which could not be escaped on any side.
WIS.17.11	For wickedness, condemned by a witness within, is a coward thing,
WIS.17.11	and, being pressed hard by conscience, always has added forecasts of the worst.
WIS.17.12	For fear is nothing else but a surrender of the help which reason offers;
WIS.17.13	and from within, the expectation of being less
WIS.17.13	makes of greater account the ignorance of the cause that brings the torment.
WIS.17.14	But they, all through the night which was powerless indeed,
WIS.17.14	and which came upon them out of the recesses of powerless Hades,
WIS.17.14	sleeping the same sleep,
WIS.17.15	now were haunted by monstrous apparitions,
WIS.17.15	and now were paralysed by their soul’s surrendering;
WIS.17.15	for sudden and unexpected fear came upon them.
WIS.17.16	So then whoever it might be, sinking down in his place,
WIS.17.16	was kept captive, shut up in that prison which was not barred with iron;
WIS.17.17	for whether he was a farmer, or a shepherd,
WIS.17.17	or a labourer whose toils were in the wilderness,
WIS.17.17	he was overtaken, and endured that inevitable necessity;
WIS.17.17	for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.
WIS.17.18	Whether there was a whistling wind,
WIS.17.18	or a melodious sound of birds amongst the spreading branches,
WIS.17.18	or a measured fall of water running violently,
WIS.17.19	or a harsh crashing of rocks hurled down,
WIS.17.19	or the swift course of animals bounding along unseen,
WIS.17.19	or the voice of wild beasts harshly roaring,
WIS.17.19	or an echo rebounding from the hollows of the mountains,
WIS.17.19	all these things paralysed them with terror.
WIS.17.20	For the whole world was illuminated with clear light,
WIS.17.20	and was occupied with unhindered works,
WIS.17.21	while over them alone was spread a heavy night,
WIS.17.21	an image of the darkness that should afterward receive them;
WIS.17.21	but to themselves, they were heavier than darkness.
WIS.18.1	But for your holy ones there was great light.
WIS.18.1	Their enemies, hearing their voice but seeing not their form,
WIS.18.1	counted it a happy thing that they too had suffered,
WIS.18.2	yet for that they do not hurt them, though wronged by them before, they are thankful;
WIS.18.2	and because they had been at variance with them, they begged for pardon.
WIS.18.3	Whereas you provided a burning pillar of fire,
WIS.18.3	to be a guide for your people’s unknown journey,
WIS.18.3	and a harmless sun for their glorious exile.
WIS.18.4	For the Egyptians well deserved to be deprived of light and imprisoned by darkness,
WIS.18.4	they who had imprisoned your children,
WIS.18.4	through whom the incorruptible light of the law was to be given to the race of men.
WIS.18.5	After they had taken counsel to kill the babes of the holy ones,
WIS.18.5	and when a single child had been abandoned and saved to convict them of their sin,
WIS.18.5	you took away from them their multitude of children,
WIS.18.5	and destroyed all their army together in a mighty flood.
WIS.18.6	Our fathers were made aware of that night beforehand,
WIS.18.6	that, having sure knowledge, they might be cheered by the oaths which they had trusted.
WIS.18.7	Salvation of the righteous and destruction of the enemies was expected by your people.
WIS.18.8	For as you took vengeance on the adversaries,
WIS.18.8	by the same means, calling us to yourself, you glorified us.
WIS.18.9	For holy children of good men offered sacrifice in secret,
WIS.18.9	and with one consent they took upon themselves the covenant of the divine law,
WIS.18.9	that they would partake alike in the same good things and the same perils,
WIS.18.9	the fathers already leading the sacred songs of praise.
WIS.18.10	But the discordant cry of the enemies echoed back,
WIS.18.10	and a pitiful voice of lamentation for children was spread abroad.
WIS.18.11	Both servant and master were punished with the same just doom,
WIS.18.11	and the commoner suffering the same as king;
WIS.18.12	Yes, they all together, under one form of death,
WIS.18.12	had corpses without number.
WIS.18.12	For the living were not sufficient even to bury them,
WIS.18.12	Since at a single stroke, their most cherished offspring was consumed.
WIS.18.13	For while they were disbelieving all things by reason of the enchantments,
WIS.18.13	upon the destruction of the firstborn they confessed the people to be God’s son.
WIS.18.14	For while peaceful silence wrapped all things,
WIS.18.14	and night in her own swiftness was in mid course,
WIS.18.15	your all-powerful word leapt from heaven out of the royal thrones,
WIS.18.15	a stern warrior, into the midst of the doomed land,
WIS.18.16	bearing as a sharp sword your authentic commandment,
WIS.18.16	and standing, it filled all things with death,
WIS.18.16	and while it touched the heaven it stood upon the earth.
WIS.18.17	Then immediately apparitions in dreams terribly troubled them,
WIS.18.17	and unexpected fears came upon them.
WIS.18.18	And each, one thrown here half dead, another there,
WIS.18.18	made known why he was dying;
WIS.18.19	for the dreams, disturbing them, forewarned them of this,
WIS.18.19	that they might not perish without knowing why they were afflicted.
WIS.18.20	But experience of death also touched the righteous,
WIS.18.20	and a multitude were destroyed in the wilderness,
WIS.18.20	however the wrath didn’t last long.
WIS.18.21	For a blameless man hurried to be their champion,
WIS.18.21	bringing the weapon of his own ministry,
WIS.18.21	prayer and the atoning sacrifice of incense,
WIS.18.21	he withstood the indignation, and set an end to the calamity,
WIS.18.21	showing that he was your servant.
WIS.18.22	And he overcame the anger,
WIS.18.22	not by strength of body, not by force of weapons,
WIS.18.22	but he subdued him who was punishing by word,
WIS.18.22	by bringing to remembrance oaths and covenants made with the fathers.
WIS.18.23	For when the dead had already fallen in heaps one upon another,
WIS.18.23	standing between he stopped the wrath,
WIS.18.23	and cut off the way to the living.
WIS.18.24	For the whole world was upon his long robe,
WIS.18.24	and the glories of the fathers were upon the engraving of the four rows of precious stones,
WIS.18.24	and your majesty was upon the diadem of his head.
WIS.18.25	The destroyer yielded to these, and they feared;
WIS.18.25	for it was enough only to test the wrath.
WIS.19.1	But indignation without mercy came upon the ungodly to the end;
WIS.19.1	For God also foreknew their future,
WIS.19.2	how, having changed their minds to let your people go,
WIS.19.2	and having sped them eagerly on their way,
WIS.19.2	they would change their minds and pursue them.
WIS.19.3	For while they were yet in the midst of their mourning,
WIS.19.3	and lamenting at the graves of the dead,
WIS.19.3	they drew upon themselves another counsel of folly,
WIS.19.3	and pursued as fugitives those whom they had begged to leave and driven out.
WIS.19.4	For the doom which they deserved was drawing them to this end,
WIS.19.4	and it made them forget the things that had happened to them,
WIS.19.4	that they might fill up the punishment which was yet lacking to their torments,
WIS.19.5	and that your people might journey on by a marvellous road,
WIS.19.5	but they themselves might find a strange death.
WIS.19.6	For the whole creation, each part in its diverse kind, was made new again,
WIS.19.6	complying with your commandments,
WIS.19.6	that your servants might be kept unharmed.
WIS.19.7	Then the cloud that overshadowed the camp was seen,
WIS.19.7	and dry land rising up out of what had been water,
WIS.19.7	out of the Red sea an unhindered highway,
WIS.19.7	and a grassy plain out of the violent surge,
WIS.19.8	by which they passed over with all their army,
WIS.19.8	these who were covered with your hand,
WIS.19.8	having seen strange marvels.
WIS.19.9	For like horses they roamed at large,
WIS.19.9	and they skipped about like lambs,
WIS.19.9	praising you, O Lord, who was their deliverer.
WIS.19.10	For they still remembered the things that happened in the time of their sojourning,
WIS.19.10	how instead of bearing cattle, the land brought forth lice,
WIS.19.10	and instead of fish, the river spewed out a multitude of frogs.
WIS.19.11	But afterwards, they also saw a new kind of birds,
WIS.19.11	when, led on by desire, they asked for luxurious dainties;
WIS.19.12	For, to comfort them, quails came up for them from the sea.
WIS.19.13	Punishments came upon the sinners,
WIS.19.13	not without the signs that were given beforehand by the force of the thunders;
WIS.19.13	for they justly suffered through their own wickednesses,
WIS.19.13	for the hatred which they practised towards guests was grievous indeed.
WIS.19.14	For whereas the others didn’t receive the strangers when they came to them,
WIS.19.14	the Egyptians made slaves of guests who were their benefactors.
WIS.19.15	And not only so, but God will visit the men of Sodom another way,
WIS.19.15	since they received as enemies those who were aliens;
WIS.19.16	whereas these first welcomed with feastings,
WIS.19.16	and then afflicted with dreadful toils,
WIS.19.16	those who had already shared with them in the same rights.
WIS.19.17	And moreover they were stricken with loss of sight
WIS.19.17	(even as were those others at the righteous man’s doors),
WIS.19.17	when, being surrounded with yawning darkness,
WIS.19.17	they each looked for the passage through his own door.
WIS.19.18	For as the notes of a lute vary the character of the rhythm,
WIS.19.18	even so the elements, changing their order one with another,
WIS.19.18	continuing always in its sound,
WIS.19.18	as may clearly be conjectured from the sight of the things that have happened.
WIS.19.19	For creatures of the dry land were turned into creatures of the waters,
WIS.19.19	and creatures that swim moved upon the land.
WIS.19.20	Fire kept the mastery of its own power in water,
WIS.19.20	and water forgot its quenching nature.
WIS.19.21	On the contrary, flames didn’t consume flesh of perishable creatures that walked amongst them,
WIS.19.21	neither did they melt the ice-like grains of ambrosial food that were apt to melt.
WIS.19.22	For in all things, O Lord, you magnified your people,
WIS.19.22	and you glorified them and didn’t lightly regard them,
WIS.19.22	standing by their side in every time and place.
SIR.1.1	All wisdom comes from the Lord,
SIR.1.1	and is with him forever.
SIR.1.2	Who can count the sand of the seas,
SIR.1.2	the drops of rain,
SIR.1.2	and the days of eternity?
SIR.1.3	Who will search out the height of the sky,
SIR.1.3	the breadth of the earth, the deep,
SIR.1.3	and wisdom?
SIR.1.4	Wisdom has been created before all things,
SIR.1.4	and the understanding of prudence from everlasting. 
SIR.1.6	To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed?
SIR.1.6	Who has known her shrewd counsels? 
SIR.1.8	There is one wise, greatly to be feared,
SIR.1.8	sitting upon his throne: the Lord.
SIR.1.9	He created her.
SIR.1.9	He saw and measured her.
SIR.1.9	He poured her out upon all his works.
SIR.1.10	She is with all flesh according to his gift.
SIR.1.10	He gave her freely to those who love him.
SIR.1.11	The fear of the Lord is glory, exultation,
SIR.1.11	and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing.
SIR.1.12	The fear of the Lord will delight the heart,
SIR.1.12	and will give gladness, joy, and length of days.
SIR.1.13	Whoever fears the Lord, it will go well with him at the last.
SIR.1.13	He will be blessed in the day of his death.
SIR.1.14	To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
SIR.1.14	It was created together with the faithful in the womb.
SIR.1.15	She
SIR.1.15	She will be trusted amongst their offspring.
SIR.1.16	To fear the Lord is the fullness of wisdom.
SIR.1.16	She inebriates men with her fruits.
SIR.1.17	She will fill all her house with desirable things,
SIR.1.17	and her storehouses with her produce.
SIR.1.18	The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom,
SIR.1.18	making peace and
SIR.1.19	He both saw and measured her.
SIR.1.19	He rained down skill and knowledge of understanding,
SIR.1.19	and exalted the honour of those who hold her fast.
SIR.1.20	To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom.
SIR.1.20	Her branches are length of days. 
SIR.1.22	Unjust wrath can never be justified,
SIR.1.22	for the sway of his wrath is his downfall.
SIR.1.23	A man that is patient will resist for a season,
SIR.1.23	and afterward gladness will spring up to him.
SIR.1.24	He will hide his words for a season,
SIR.1.24	and the lips of many will tell of his understanding.
SIR.1.25	A parable of knowledge is in the treasures of wisdom;
SIR.1.25	but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.
SIR.1.26	If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments
SIR.1.26	and the Lord will give her to you freely;
SIR.1.27	for the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction.
SIR.1.27	Faith and humility are his good pleasure.
SIR.1.28	Don’t disobey the fear of the Lord.
SIR.1.28	Don’t come to him with a double heart.
SIR.1.29	Don’t be a hypocrite in the mouths of men.
SIR.1.29	Keep watch over your lips.
SIR.1.30	Don’t exalt yourself,
SIR.1.30	lest you fall and bring dishonour upon your soul.
SIR.1.30	The Lord will reveal your secrets
SIR.1.30	and will cast you down in the midst of the congregation,
SIR.1.30	because you didn’t come to the fear of the Lord
SIR.1.30	and your heart was full of deceit.
SIR.2.1	My son, if you come to serve the Lord,
SIR.2.1	prepare your soul for temptation.
SIR.2.2	Set your heart aright, constantly endure,
SIR.2.2	and don’t make haste in time of calamity.
SIR.2.3	Cling to him, and don’t depart,
SIR.2.3	that you may be increased at your latter end.
SIR.2.4	Accept whatever is brought upon you,
SIR.2.4	and be patient when you suffer humiliation.
SIR.2.5	For gold is tried in the fire,
SIR.2.5	and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.
SIR.2.6	Put your trust in him, and he will help you.
SIR.2.6	Make your ways straight, and set your hope on him.
SIR.2.7	All you who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy.
SIR.2.7	Don’t turn aside, lest you fall.
SIR.2.8	All you who fear the Lord, put your trust in him,
SIR.2.8	and your reward will not fail.
SIR.2.9	All you who fear the Lord, hope for good things,
SIR.2.9	and for eternal gladness and mercy.
SIR.2.10	Look at the generations of old, and see:
SIR.2.10	Who ever put his trust in the Lord, and was ashamed?
SIR.2.10	Or who remained in his fear, and was forsaken?
SIR.2.10	Or who called upon him, and he despised him?
SIR.2.11	For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
SIR.2.11	He forgives sins and saves in time of affliction.
SIR.2.12	Woe to fearful hearts, to faint hands,
SIR.2.12	and to the sinner that goes two ways!
SIR.2.13	Woe to the faint heart! For it doesn’t believe.
SIR.2.13	Therefore it won’t be defended.
SIR.2.14	Woe to you who have lost your patience!
SIR.2.14	And what will you all do when the Lord visits you?
SIR.2.15	Those who fear the Lord will not disobey his words.
SIR.2.15	Those who love him will keep his ways.
SIR.2.16	Those who fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure.
SIR.2.16	Those who love him will be filled with the law.
SIR.2.17	Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts,
SIR.2.17	and will humble their souls in his sight.
SIR.2.18	We will fall into the hands of the Lord,
SIR.2.18	and not into the hands of men;
SIR.2.18	for as his majesty is,
SIR.2.18	so also is his mercy.
SIR.3.1	Hear me, your father, O my children,
SIR.3.1	and do what you hear, that you all may be saved.
SIR.3.2	For the Lord has given the father glory concerning the children,
SIR.3.2	and has confirmed the judgement of the mother concerning the sons.
SIR.3.3	He who honours his father will make atonement for sins.
SIR.3.4	He that gives glory to his mother is as one who lays up treasure.
SIR.3.5	Whoever honours his father will have joy in his own children.
SIR.3.5	He will be heard in the day of his prayer.
SIR.3.6	He who gives glory to his father will have length of days.
SIR.3.6	He who listens to the Lord will bring rest to his mother,
SIR.3.8	Honour your father in deed and word,
SIR.3.8	that a blessing may come upon you from him.
SIR.3.9	For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children,
SIR.3.9	but the curse of the mother roots out the foundations.
SIR.3.10	Don’t glorify yourself in the dishonour of your father,
SIR.3.10	for your father’s dishonour is no glory to you.
SIR.3.11	For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father,
SIR.3.11	and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to her children.
SIR.3.12	My son, help your father in his old age,
SIR.3.12	and don’t grieve him as long as he lives.
SIR.3.13	If he fails in understanding, have patience with him.
SIR.3.13	Don’t dishonour him in your full strength.
SIR.3.14	For the relieving of your father will not be forgotten.
SIR.3.14	Instead of sins it will be added to build you up.
SIR.3.15	In the day of your affliction it will remember you,
SIR.3.15	as fair weather upon ice,
SIR.3.15	so will your sins also melt away.
SIR.3.16	He who forsakes his father is as a blasphemer.
SIR.3.16	He who provokes his mother is cursed by the Lord.
SIR.3.17	My son, go on with your business in humility;
SIR.3.17	so you will be loved by an acceptable man.
SIR.3.18	The greater you are, humble yourself the more,
SIR.3.18	and you will find favour before the Lord. 
SIR.3.20	For the power of the Lord is great,
SIR.3.20	and he is glorified by those who are lowly.
SIR.3.21	Don’t seek things that are too hard for you,
SIR.3.21	and don’t search out things that are above your strength.
SIR.3.22	Think about the things that have been commanded you,
SIR.3.22	for you have no need of the things that are secret.
SIR.3.23	Don’t be overly busy in your superfluous works,
SIR.3.23	for more things are showed to you than men can understand.
SIR.3.24	For the conceit of many has led them astray.
SIR.3.24	Evil opinion has caused their judgement to slip.
SIR.3.25	There is no wisdom without knowledge.
SIR.3.26	A stubborn heart will do badly at the end.
SIR.3.26	He who loves danger will perish in it.
SIR.3.27	A stubborn heart will be burdened with troubles.
SIR.3.27	The sinner will heap sin upon sins.
SIR.3.28	The calamity of the proud is no healing,
SIR.3.28	for a weed of wickedness has taken root in him.
SIR.3.29	The heart of the prudent will understand a parable.
SIR.3.29	A wise man desires the ear of a listener.
SIR.3.30	Water will quench a flaming fire;
SIR.3.30	almsgiving will make atonement for sins.
SIR.3.31	He who repays good turns is mindful of that which comes afterward.
SIR.3.31	In the time of his falling he will find a support.
SIR.4.1	My son, don’t deprive the poor of his living.
SIR.4.1	Don’t make the needy eyes wait long.
SIR.4.2	Don’t make a hungry soul sorrowful,
SIR.4.2	or provoke a man in his distress.
SIR.4.3	Don’t add more trouble to a heart that is provoked.
SIR.4.3	Don’t put off giving to him who is in need.
SIR.4.4	Don’t reject a suppliant in his affliction.
SIR.4.4	Don’t turn your face away from a poor man.
SIR.4.5	Don’t turn your eye away from one who asks.
SIR.4.5	Give no occasion to a man to curse you.
SIR.4.6	For if he curses you in the bitterness of his soul,
SIR.4.6	he who made him will hear his supplication.
SIR.4.7	Endear yourself to the assembly.
SIR.4.7	Bow your head to a great man.
SIR.4.8	Incline your ear to a poor man.
SIR.4.8	Answer him with peaceful words in humility.
SIR.4.9	Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of him that wrongs him;
SIR.4.9	Don’t be faint-hearted in giving judgement.
SIR.4.10	Be as a father to the fatherless,
SIR.4.10	and like a husband to their mother.
SIR.4.10	So you will be as a son of the Most High,
SIR.4.10	and he will love you more than your mother does.
SIR.4.11	Wisdom exalts her sons,
SIR.4.11	and takes hold of those who seek her.
SIR.4.12	He who loves her loves life.
SIR.4.12	Those who seek her early will be filled with gladness.
SIR.4.13	He who holds her fast will inherit glory.
SIR.4.13	Where
SIR.4.14	Those who serve her minister to the Holy One.
SIR.4.14	The Lord loves those who love her.
SIR.4.15	He who gives ear to her will judge the nations.
SIR.4.15	He who heeds her will dwell securely.
SIR.4.16	If he trusts her, he will inherit her,
SIR.4.16	and his generations will possess her.
SIR.4.17	For at the first she will walk with him in crooked ways,
SIR.4.17	and will bring fear and dread upon him,
SIR.4.17	and torment him with her discipline,
SIR.4.17	until she may trust his soul, and try him by her judgements.
SIR.4.18	Then she will return him again to the straight way,
SIR.4.18	and will gladden him, and reveal to him her secrets.
SIR.4.19	If he goes astray, she will forsake him,
SIR.4.19	and hand him over to his fall.
SIR.4.20	Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil.
SIR.4.20	Don’t be ashamed of your soul.
SIR.4.21	For there is a shame that brings sin,
SIR.4.21	and there is a shame that is glory and grace.
SIR.4.22	Don’t show partiality against your soul.
SIR.4.22	Don’t revere any man to your falling.
SIR.4.23	Don’t refrain from speaking when it is for safety.
SIR.4.24	For wisdom will be known by speech,
SIR.4.24	and instruction by the word of the tongue.
SIR.4.25	Don’t speak against the truth
SIR.4.25	and be shamed for your ignorance.
SIR.4.26	Don’t be ashamed to confess your sins.
SIR.4.26	Don’t fight the river’s current.
SIR.4.27	Don’t lay yourself down for a fool to tread upon.
SIR.4.27	Don’t be partial to one that is mighty.
SIR.4.28	Strive for the truth to death,
SIR.4.28	and the Lord God will fight for you.
SIR.4.29	Don’t be hasty with your tongue,
SIR.4.29	or slack and negligent in your deeds.
SIR.4.30	Don’t be like a lion in your house,
SIR.4.30	or suspicious of your servants.
SIR.4.31	Don’t let your hand be stretched out to receive,
SIR.4.31	and closed when you should repay.
SIR.5.1	Don’t set your heart upon your goods.
SIR.5.1	Don’t say, “They are sufficient for me.”
SIR.5.2	Don’t follow your own mind and your strength
SIR.5.2	to walk in the desires of your heart.
SIR.5.3	Don’t say, “Who will have dominion over me?”
SIR.5.3	for the Lord will surely take vengeance on you.
SIR.5.4	Don’t say, “I sinned, and what happened to me?”
SIR.5.4	for the Lord is patient.
SIR.5.5	Don’t be so confident of atonement
SIR.5.5	that you add sin upon sins.
SIR.5.6	Don’t say, “His compassion is great.
SIR.5.6	He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins,”
SIR.5.6	for mercy and wrath are with him,
SIR.5.6	and his indignation will rest on sinners.
SIR.5.7	Don’t wait to turn to the Lord.
SIR.5.7	Don’t put off from day to day;
SIR.5.7	for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will come on you,
SIR.5.7	and you will perish in the time of vengeance.
SIR.5.8	Don’t set your heart upon unrighteous gains,
SIR.5.8	for you will profit nothing in the day of calamity.
SIR.5.9	Don’t winnow with every wind.
SIR.5.9	Don’t walk in every path.
SIR.5.9	This is what the sinner who has a double tongue does.
SIR.5.10	Be steadfast in your understanding.
SIR.5.10	Let your speech be consistent.
SIR.5.11	Be swift to hear
SIR.5.11	and answer with patience.
SIR.5.12	If you have understanding, answer your neighbour;
SIR.5.12	but if not, put your hand over your mouth.
SIR.5.13	Glory and dishonour is in talk.
SIR.5.13	A man’s tongue may be his downfall.
SIR.5.14	Don’t be called a whisperer.
SIR.5.14	Don’t lie in wait with your tongue;
SIR.5.14	for shame is on the thief,
SIR.5.14	and an evil condemnation is on him who has a double tongue.
SIR.5.15	Don’t be ignorant in a great or small matter.
SIR.6.1	Don’t become an enemy instead of a friend;
SIR.6.1	for an evil name will inherit shame and reproach.
SIR.6.1	So it is with the sinner who has a double tongue.
SIR.6.2	Don’t exalt yourself in the counsel of your soul,
SIR.6.2	that your soul be not torn in pieces as a bull.
SIR.6.3	You will eat up your leaves, destroy your fruit,
SIR.6.3	and leave yourself as a dry tree.
SIR.6.4	A wicked soul will destroy him who has it,
SIR.6.4	and will make him a laughing stock to his enemies.
SIR.6.5	Sweet words will multiply a man’s friends.
SIR.6.5	A gracious tongue will multiply courtesies.
SIR.6.6	Let those that are at peace with you be many,
SIR.6.6	but your advisers one of a thousand.
SIR.6.7	If you want to gain a friend, get him in a time of testing,
SIR.6.7	and don’t be in a hurry to trust him.
SIR.6.8	For there is a friend just for an occasion.
SIR.6.8	He won’t continue in the day of your affliction.
SIR.6.9	And there is a friend who turns into an enemy.
SIR.6.9	He will discover strife to your reproach.
SIR.6.10	And there is a friend who is a companion at the table,
SIR.6.10	but he won’t continue in the day of your affliction.
SIR.6.11	In your prosperity he will be as yourself,
SIR.6.11	and will be bold over your servants.
SIR.6.12	If you are brought low, he will be against you,
SIR.6.12	and will hide himself from your face.
SIR.6.13	Separate yourself from your enemies,
SIR.6.13	and beware of your friends.
SIR.6.14	A faithful friend is a strong defence.
SIR.6.14	He who has found him has found a treasure.
SIR.6.15	There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend.
SIR.6.15	His excellency is beyond price.
SIR.6.16	A faithful friend is a life-saving medicine.
SIR.6.16	Those who fear the Lord will find him.
SIR.6.17	He who fears the Lord directs his friendship properly;
SIR.6.17	for as he is, so is his neighbour also.
SIR.6.18	My son, gather instruction from your youth up.
SIR.6.18	Even when you have grey hair you will find wisdom.
SIR.6.19	Come to her as one who ploughs and sows
SIR.6.19	and wait for her good fruit;
SIR.6.19	for your toil will be little in her tillage,
SIR.6.19	and you will soon eat of her fruit.
SIR.6.20	How exceedingly harsh she is to the unlearned!
SIR.6.20	He who is without understanding will not remain in her.
SIR.6.21	She will rest upon him as a mighty stone of trial.
SIR.6.21	He won’t hesitate to cast her from him.
SIR.6.22	For wisdom is according to her name.
SIR.6.22	She isn’t manifest to many.
SIR.6.23	Give ear, my son, and accept my judgement.
SIR.6.23	Don’t refuse my counsel.
SIR.6.24	Bring your feet into her fetters,
SIR.6.24	and your neck into her chain.
SIR.6.25	Put your shoulder under her and bear her.
SIR.6.25	Don’t be grieved with her bonds.
SIR.6.26	Come to her with all your soul.
SIR.6.26	Keep her ways with your whole power.
SIR.6.27	Search and seek, and she will be made known to you.
SIR.6.27	When you get hold of her, don’t let her go.
SIR.6.28	For at the last you will find her rest;
SIR.6.28	and she will be turned for you into gladness.
SIR.6.29	Her fetters will be to you for a covering of strength,
SIR.6.29	and her chains for a robe of glory.
SIR.6.30	For there is a golden ornament upon her,
SIR.6.30	and her bands are 
SIR.6.31	You shall put her on as a robe of glory,
SIR.6.31	and shall put her on as a crown of rejoicing.
SIR.6.32	My son, if you are willing, you will be instructed.
SIR.6.32	If you will yield your soul, you will be prudent.
SIR.6.33	If you love to hear, you will receive.
SIR.6.33	If you incline your ear, you will be wise.
SIR.6.34	Stand in the multitude of the elders.
SIR.6.34	Attach yourself to whoever is wise.
SIR.6.35	Be willing to listen to every godly discourse.
SIR.6.35	Don’t let the proverbs of understanding escape you.
SIR.6.36	If you see a man of understanding, get to him early.
SIR.6.36	Let your foot wear out the steps of his doors.
SIR.6.37	Let your mind dwell on the ordinances of the Lord
SIR.6.37	and meditate continually on his commandments.
SIR.6.37	He will establish your heart
SIR.6.37	and your desire for wisdom will be given to you.
SIR.7.1	Do no evil,
SIR.7.1	so no evil will overtake you.
SIR.7.2	Depart from wrong,
SIR.7.2	and it will turn away from you.
SIR.7.3	My son, don’t sow upon the furrows of unrighteousness,
SIR.7.3	and you won’t reap them sevenfold.
SIR.7.4	Don’t seek preeminence from the Lord,
SIR.7.4	nor the seat of honour from the king.
SIR.7.5	Don’t justify yourself in the presence of the Lord,
SIR.7.5	and don’t display your wisdom before the king.
SIR.7.6	Don’t seek to be a judge,
SIR.7.6	lest you not be able to take away iniquities,
SIR.7.6	lest perhaps you fear the person of a mighty man,
SIR.7.6	and lay a stumbling block in the way of your uprightness.
SIR.7.7	Don’t sin against the multitude of the city.
SIR.7.7	Don’t cast yourself down in the crowd.
SIR.7.8	Don’t commit a sin twice,
SIR.7.8	for even in one you will not be unpunished.
SIR.7.9	Don’t say, “He will look upon the multitude of my gifts.
SIR.7.9	When I make an offering to the Most High God, he will accept it.”
SIR.7.10	Don’t be faint-hearted in your prayer.
SIR.7.10	Don’t neglect to give alms.
SIR.7.11	Don’t laugh a man to scorn when he is in the bitterness of his soul,
SIR.7.11	for there is one who humbles and exalts.
SIR.7.12	or do the same to a friend.
SIR.7.13	Don’t love to make any manner of lie,
SIR.7.13	for that is not a good habit.
SIR.7.14	Don’t babble in the multitude of elders.
SIR.7.14	Don’t repeat your words in your prayer.
SIR.7.15	Don’t hate hard labour
SIR.7.15	or farm work, which the Most High has created.
SIR.7.16	Don’t number yourself amongst the multitude of sinners.
SIR.7.16	Remember that wrath will not wait.
SIR.7.17	Humble your soul greatly,
SIR.7.17	for the punishment of the ungodly man is fire and the worm.
SIR.7.18	Don’t exchange a friend for something,
SIR.7.18	neither a true brother for the gold of Ophir.
SIR.7.19	Don’t deprive yourself of a wise and good wife,
SIR.7.19	for her grace is worth more than gold.
SIR.7.20	Don’t abuse a servant who works faithfully,
SIR.7.20	or a hireling who gives you his life.
SIR.7.21	Let your soul love a wise servant.
SIR.7.21	Don’t defraud him of liberty.
SIR.7.22	Do you have cattle? Look after them.
SIR.7.22	If they are profitable to you, let them stay by you.
SIR.7.23	Do you have children? Correct them,
SIR.7.23	and bow down their necks from their youth.
SIR.7.24	Do you have daughters? Take care of their bodies,
SIR.7.24	and don’t be overly indulgent towards them.
SIR.7.25	Give your daughter in marriage, and you will have accomplished a great matter.
SIR.7.25	Give her to a man of understanding.
SIR.7.26	Do you have a wife after your mind? Don’t cast her out.
SIR.7.27	Give glory to your father with your whole heart,
SIR.7.27	and don’t forget the birth pangs of your mother.
SIR.7.28	Remember that you were born of them.
SIR.7.28	What will you repay them for the things that they have done for you?
SIR.7.29	Fear the Lord with all your soul;
SIR.7.29	and revere his priests.
SIR.7.30	With all your strength love him who made you.
SIR.7.30	Don’t forsake his ministers.
SIR.7.31	Fear the Lord and honour the priest.
SIR.7.31	Give him his portion, even as it is commanded you:
SIR.7.31	the first fruits, the trespass offering, the gift of the shoulders,
SIR.7.31	the sacrifice of sanctification, and the first fruits of holy things.
SIR.7.32	Also stretch out your hand to the poor man,
SIR.7.32	that your blessing may be perfected.
SIR.7.33	A gift has grace in the sight of every living man.
SIR.7.33	Don’t withhold grace for a dead man.
SIR.7.34	Don’t be lacking to those who weep,
SIR.7.34	and mourn with those who mourn.
SIR.7.35	Don’t be slow to visit a sick man,
SIR.7.35	for by such things you will gain love.
SIR.7.36	In all your words, remember eternity,
SIR.7.36	and you will never sin.
SIR.8.1	Don’t contend with a mighty man,
SIR.8.1	lest perhaps you fall into his hands.
SIR.8.2	Don’t strive with a rich man, lest perhaps he overpower you;
SIR.8.2	for gold has destroyed many,
SIR.8.2	and turned away the hearts of kings.
SIR.8.3	Don’t contend with a talkative man.
SIR.8.3	Don’t heap wood upon his fire.
SIR.8.4	Don’t jest with a rude man,
SIR.8.4	lest your ancestors be dishonoured.
SIR.8.5	Don’t reproach a man when he turns from sin.
SIR.8.5	Remember that we are all worthy of punishment.
SIR.8.6	Don’t dishonour a man in his old age;
SIR.8.6	for some of us are also growing old.
SIR.8.7	Don’t rejoice over one who is dead.
SIR.8.7	Remember that we all die.
SIR.8.8	Don’t neglect the discourse of the wise.
SIR.8.8	Be conversant with their proverbs;
SIR.8.8	for from them you will learn instruction
SIR.8.8	and how to minister to great men.
SIR.8.9	Don’t miss the discourse of the aged,
SIR.8.9	for they also learnt from their fathers,
SIR.8.9	because from them you will learn understanding,
SIR.8.9	and to give an answer in time of need.
SIR.8.10	Don’t kindle the coals of a sinner,
SIR.8.10	lest you be burnt with the flame of his fire.
SIR.8.11	Don’t rise up from the presence of an insolent man,
SIR.8.11	lest he lie in wait as an ambush for your mouth.
SIR.8.12	Don’t lend to a man who is mightier than yourself;
SIR.8.12	and if you lend, be as one who has lost.
SIR.8.13	Don’t be surety above your power.
SIR.8.13	If you are surety, think as one who will have to pay.
SIR.8.14	Don’t go to law with a judge;
SIR.8.14	for according to his honour they will give judgement for him.
SIR.8.15	Don’t go in the way with a rash man,
SIR.8.15	lest he be burdensome to you;
SIR.8.15	for he will do according to his own will,
SIR.8.15	and you will perish with his folly.
SIR.8.16	Don’t fight with a wrathful man.
SIR.8.16	Don’t travel with him through the desert,
SIR.8.16	for blood is as nothing in his sight.
SIR.8.16	Where there is no help, he will overthrow you.
SIR.8.17	Don’t take counsel with a fool,
SIR.8.17	for he will not be able to conceal the matter.
SIR.8.18	Do no secret thing before a stranger,
SIR.8.18	For you don’t know what it will cause.
SIR.8.19	Don’t open your heart to every man.
SIR.8.19	Don’t let him return you a favour.
SIR.9.1	Don’t be jealous over the wife of your bosom,
SIR.9.1	and don’t teach her an evil lesson against yourself.
SIR.9.2	Don’t give your soul to a woman,
SIR.9.2	that she should set her foot upon your strength.
SIR.9.3	Don’t go to meet a woman who plays the prostitute,
SIR.9.3	lest perhaps you fall into her snares.
SIR.9.4	Don’t use the company of a woman who is a singer,
SIR.9.4	lest perhaps you be caught by her attempts.
SIR.9.5	Don’t gaze at a maid,
SIR.9.5	lest perhaps you be trapped in her penalties.
SIR.9.6	Don’t give your soul to prostitutes,
SIR.9.6	that you not lose your inheritance.
SIR.9.7	Don’t look around you in the streets of the city,
SIR.9.7	neither wander in its solitary places.
SIR.9.8	Turn your eye away from a beautiful woman,
SIR.9.8	and don’t gaze at another’s beauty.
SIR.9.8	Many have been led astray by the beauty of a woman;
SIR.9.8	and with this, affection is kindled as a fire.
SIR.9.9	Don’t sit at all with a woman who has a husband,
SIR.9.9	or revel with her at the wine,
SIR.9.9	lest perhaps your soul turn away to her,
SIR.9.9	and with your spirit you slide into destruction.
SIR.9.10	Don’t forsake an old friend;
SIR.9.10	for the new is not comparable to him.
SIR.9.10	A new friend is like new wine:
SIR.9.10	if it becomes old, you will drink it with gladness.
SIR.9.11	Don’t envy the glory of a sinner;
SIR.9.11	for you don’t know what his overthrow will be.
SIR.9.12	Don’t delight in the delights of the ungodly.
SIR.9.12	Remember they will not go unpunished to
SIR.9.13	Keep yourself far from the man who has
SIR.9.13	and you will have no suspicion of the fear of death.
SIR.9.13	If you come to him, commit no fault,
SIR.9.13	lest he take away your life.
SIR.9.13	Know surely that you go about in the midst of snares,
SIR.9.13	and walk upon the battlements of a city.
SIR.9.14	As well as you can, aim to know your neighbours,
SIR.9.14	and take counsel with the wise.
SIR.9.15	Let your conversation be with men of understanding.
SIR.9.15	Let all your discourse be in the law of the Most High.
SIR.9.16	Let just men be companions at your table.
SIR.9.16	Let your glorying be in the fear of the Lord.
SIR.9.17	A work is commended because of the hand of the artisan;
SIR.9.17	so he who rules the people will be considered wise for his speech.
SIR.9.18	A talkative man is dangerous in his city.
SIR.9.18	He who is headlong in his speech will be hated.
SIR.10.1	A wise judge will instruct his people.
SIR.10.1	The government of a man of understanding will be well ordered.
SIR.10.2	As is the judge of his people, so are his ministers.
SIR.10.2	As the city’s ruler is, so are all those who dwell in it.
SIR.10.3	An uninstructed king will destroy his people.
SIR.10.3	A city will be established through the understanding of the powerful.
SIR.10.4	The authority of the earth is in the Lord’s hand.
SIR.10.4	In due time, he will raise up over it one who is profitable.
SIR.10.5	A man’s prosperity is in the Lord’s hand.
SIR.10.5	He will lay his honour upon the person of the scribe.
SIR.10.6	Don’t be angry with your neighbour for every wrong.
SIR.10.6	Do nothing by works of violence.
SIR.10.7	Pride is hateful before the Lord and men.
SIR.10.7	Unrighteousness is abhorrent in the judgement of both.
SIR.10.8	Sovereignty is transferred from nation to nation
SIR.10.8	because of iniquities, deeds of violence, and greed for money.
SIR.10.9	Why are dirt and ashes proud?
SIR.10.9	Because in life, my body decays.
SIR.10.10	A long disease mocks the physician.
SIR.10.10	He is a king today, and tomorrow he will die.
SIR.10.11	For when a man is dead,
SIR.10.11	he will inherit creeping things, and beasts, and worms.
SIR.10.12	It is the beginning of pride when a man departs from the Lord.
SIR.10.12	His heart has departed from him who made him.
SIR.10.13	For the beginning of pride is sin.
SIR.10.13	He who keeps it will pour out abomination.
SIR.10.13	For this cause the Lord brought upon them strange calamities
SIR.10.13	and utterly overthrew them.
SIR.10.14	The Lord cast down the thrones of rulers
SIR.10.14	and set the meek in their place.
SIR.10.15	The Lord plucked up the roots of nations
SIR.10.15	and planted the lowly in their place.
SIR.10.16	The Lord overthrew the lands of nations
SIR.10.16	and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.
SIR.10.17	He took some of them away and destroyed them,
SIR.10.17	and made their memorial to cease from the earth.
SIR.10.18	Pride has not been created for men,
SIR.10.18	nor wrathful anger for the offspring of women.
SIR.10.19	What manner of seed has honour?
SIR.10.19	The seed of man, those who fear the Lord.
SIR.10.19	What manner of seed has no honour?
SIR.10.19	The seed of man, those who transgress the commandments.
SIR.10.20	In the midst of kindred he who rules them has honour.
SIR.10.20	Those who fear the Lord have honour in his eyes. 
SIR.10.22	The rich man, the honourable, and the poor
SIR.10.22	all glory in the fear of the Lord.
SIR.10.23	It is not right to dishonour a poor man who has understanding.
SIR.10.23	It is not fitting to glorify a man who is a sinner.
SIR.10.24	The great man, the judge, and the mighty man will be glorified.
SIR.10.24	There is not one of them greater than he who fears the Lord.
SIR.10.25	Free men will minister to a wise servant.
SIR.10.25	A man who has knowledge will not complain.
SIR.10.26	Don’t flaunt your wisdom in doing your work.
SIR.10.26	Don’t glorify yourself in the time of your distress.
SIR.10.27	Than he who glorifies himself and lacks bread.
SIR.10.28	My son, glorify your soul in humility,
SIR.10.28	and esteem yourself honour according to your worthiness.
SIR.10.29	Who will justify him who sins against his own soul?
SIR.10.29	Who will glorify him who dishonours his own life?
SIR.10.30	A poor man is glorified for his knowledge.
SIR.10.30	A rich man is glorified for his riches.
SIR.10.31	But he who is glorified in poverty, how much more in riches?
SIR.10.31	He who is dishonoured in riches, how much more in poverty?
SIR.11.1	The wisdom of the lowly will lift up his head,
SIR.11.1	and make him sit in the midst of great men.
SIR.11.2	Don’t commend a man for his beauty.
SIR.11.2	Don’t abhor a man for his outward appearance.
SIR.11.3	The bee is little amongst flying creatures,
SIR.11.3	but what it produces is the best of confections.
SIR.11.4	Don’t boast about the clothes you wear,
SIR.11.4	and don’t exalt yourself in the day of honour;
SIR.11.4	for the Lord’s works are wonderful,
SIR.11.4	and his works are hidden amongst men.
SIR.11.5	Many
SIR.11.5	but one who was never thought of has worn a crown.
SIR.11.6	Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced.
SIR.11.6	Men of renown have been delivered into other men’s hands.
SIR.11.7	Don’t blame before you investigate.
SIR.11.7	Understand first, and then rebuke.
SIR.11.8	Don’t answer before you have heard.
SIR.11.8	Don’t interrupt while someone else is speaking.
SIR.11.9	Don’t argue about a matter that doesn’t concern you.
SIR.11.9	Don’t sit with sinners when they judge.
SIR.11.10	My son, don’t be busy about many matters;
SIR.11.10	for if you meddle much, you will not be unpunished.
SIR.11.10	If you pursue, you will not overtake,
SIR.11.10	and you will not escape by fleeing.
SIR.11.11	There is one who toils, labours, and makes haste,
SIR.11.11	and is even more behind.
SIR.11.12	There is one who is sluggish, and needs help,
SIR.11.12	lacking in strength, and who abounds in poverty,
SIR.11.12	but the Lord’s eyes looked upon him for good,
SIR.11.12	and he raised him up from his low condition,
SIR.11.13	and lifted up his head
SIR.11.13	so that many marvelled at him.
SIR.11.14	Good things and evil, life and death,
SIR.11.14	poverty and riches, are from the Lord. 
SIR.11.17	The Lord’s gift remains with the godly.
SIR.11.17	His good pleasure will prosper forever.
SIR.11.18	One grows rich by his diligence and self-denial,
SIR.11.18	and this is the portion of his reward:
SIR.11.19	when he says, “I have found rest,
SIR.11.19	and now I will eat of my goods!”
SIR.11.19	he doesn’t know how much time will pass
SIR.11.19	until he leaves them to others and dies.
SIR.11.20	Be steadfast in your covenant and be doing it,
SIR.11.20	and grow old in your work.
SIR.11.21	Don’t marvel at the works of a sinner,
SIR.11.21	but trust the Lord and stay in your labour;
SIR.11.21	for it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord
SIR.11.21	to swiftly and suddenly make a poor man rich.
SIR.11.22	The Lord’s blessing is in the reward of the godly.
SIR.11.22	He makes his blessing flourish in an hour that comes swiftly.
SIR.11.23	Don’t say, “What use is there of me?
SIR.11.23	What further good things can be mine?”
SIR.11.24	Don’t say, “I have enough.
SIR.11.24	What harm could happen to me now?”
SIR.11.25	In the day of good things, evil things are forgotten.
SIR.11.25	In the day of evil things, a man will not remember things that are good.
SIR.11.26	For it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord
SIR.11.26	to reward a man in the day of death according to his ways.
SIR.11.27	The affliction of an hour causes delights to be forgotten.
SIR.11.27	In the end, a man’s deeds are revealed.
SIR.11.28	Call no man happy before his death.
SIR.11.28	A man will be known in his children.
SIR.11.29	Don’t bring every man into your house,
SIR.11.29	for many are the plots of a deceitful man.
SIR.11.30	Like a decoy partridge in a cage, so is the heart of a proud man.
SIR.11.30	Like a spy, he looks for your weakness.
SIR.11.31	For he lies in wait to turn things that are good into evil,
SIR.11.31	and assigns blame in things that are praiseworthy.
SIR.11.32	From a spark of fire, a heap of many coals is kindled,
SIR.11.32	and a sinful man lies in wait for blood.
SIR.11.33	Take heed of an evil-doer, for he plans wicked things,
SIR.11.33	lest perhaps he ruin your reputation forever.
SIR.11.34	Receive a stranger into your house, and he will distract you with arguments
SIR.11.34	and estrange you from your own.
SIR.12.1	If you do good, know to whom you do it,
SIR.12.1	and your good deeds will have thanks.
SIR.12.2	Do good to a godly man, and you will find a reward—
SIR.12.2	if not from him, then from the Most High.
SIR.12.3	No good will come to him who continues to do evil,
SIR.12.3	nor to him who gives no alms.
SIR.12.4	Give to the godly man,
SIR.12.4	and don’t help the sinner.
SIR.12.5	Do good to one who is lowly.
SIR.12.5	Don’t give to an ungodly man.
SIR.12.5	Keep back his bread, and don’t give it to him,
SIR.12.5	lest he subdue you with it;
SIR.12.5	for you would receive twice as much evil
SIR.12.5	for all the good you would have done to him.
SIR.12.6	For the Most High also hates sinners,
SIR.12.6	and will repay vengeance to the ungodly.
SIR.12.7	Give to the good man,
SIR.12.7	and don’t help the sinner.
SIR.12.8	A man’s friend won’t be
SIR.12.8	His enemy won’t be hidden in adversity.
SIR.12.9	In a man’s prosperity, his enemies are grieved.
SIR.12.9	In his adversity, even his friend leaves.
SIR.12.10	Never trust your enemy,
SIR.12.10	for his wickedness is like corrosion in copper.
SIR.12.11	Though he humbles himself and walks bowed down,
SIR.12.11	still be careful and beware of him.
SIR.12.11	You will be to him as one who has wiped a mirror,
SIR.12.11	to be sure it doesn’t completely tarnish.
SIR.12.12	Don’t set him next to you,
SIR.12.12	lest he overthrow you and stand in your place.
SIR.12.12	Don’t let him sit on your right hand,
SIR.12.12	lest he seek to take your seat,
SIR.12.12	and at the last you acknowledge my words,
SIR.12.12	and be pricked with my sayings.
SIR.12.13	Who will pity a charmer that is bitten by a snake,
SIR.12.13	or any who come near wild beasts?
SIR.12.14	Even so, who will pity him who goes to a sinner,
SIR.12.14	and is associated with him in his sins?
SIR.12.15	For a while he will stay with you,
SIR.12.15	and if you falter, he will not stay.
SIR.12.16	The enemy will speak sweetly with his lips,
SIR.12.16	and in his heart plan to throw you into a pit.
SIR.12.16	The enemy may weep with his eyes,
SIR.12.16	but if he finds opportunity, he will want more blood.
SIR.12.17	If adversity meets you, you will find him there before you.
SIR.12.17	Pretending to help you, he will trip you.
SIR.12.18	He will shake his head, clap his hands,
SIR.12.18	whisper much, and change his countenance.
SIR.13.1	He who touches pitch will be defiled.
SIR.13.1	He who has fellowship with a proud man will become like him.
SIR.13.2	Don’t take up a burden above your strength.
SIR.13.2	Have no fellowship with one who is mightier and richer than yourself.
SIR.13.2	What fellowship would the earthen pot have with the kettle?
SIR.13.2	The kettle will strike, and the pot will be dashed in pieces.
SIR.13.3	The rich man does a wrong and threatens.
SIR.13.3	The poor is wronged and apologises.
SIR.13.4	If you are profitable, he will make merchandise of you.
SIR.13.4	If you are in lack, he will forsake you.
SIR.13.5	If you own something, he will live with you.
SIR.13.5	He will drain you bare and will not be sorry.
SIR.13.6	Does he need you? Then he will deceive you,
SIR.13.6	smile at you, and give you hope.
SIR.13.6	He will speak kindly to you and say, “What do you need?”
SIR.13.7	He will shame you by his meats
SIR.13.7	until he has made you bare twice or thrice,
SIR.13.7	and in the end he will laugh you to scorn.
SIR.13.7	Afterward he will see you, will forsake you,
SIR.13.7	and shake his head at you.
SIR.13.8	Beware that you are not deceived
SIR.13.8	and brought low in your mirth.
SIR.13.9	If a mighty man invites you, be reserved,
SIR.13.9	and he will invite you more.
SIR.13.10	Don’t press him, lest you be thrust back.
SIR.13.10	Don’t stand far off, lest you be forgotten.
SIR.13.11	Don’t try to speak with him as an equal,
SIR.13.11	and don’t believe his many words;
SIR.13.11	For he will test you with much talk,
SIR.13.11	and will examine you in a smiling manner.
SIR.13.12	He who doesn’t keep secrets to himself is unmerciful.
SIR.13.12	He won’t hesitate to harm and to bind.
SIR.13.13	Keep them to yourself and be careful,
SIR.13.13	for you walk
SIR.13.15	Every living creature loves its own kind,
SIR.13.15	and every man loves his neighbour.
SIR.13.16	All flesh associates with their own kind.
SIR.13.16	A man will stick to people like himself.
SIR.13.17	What fellowship would the wolf have with the lamb?
SIR.13.17	So is the sinner to the godly.
SIR.13.18	What peace is there between a hyena and a dog?
SIR.13.18	What peace is there between a rich man and the poor?
SIR.13.19	Wild donkeys are the prey of lions in the wilderness;
SIR.13.19	likewise poor men are feeding grounds for the rich.
SIR.13.20	Lowliness is an abomination to a proud man;
SIR.13.20	likewise a poor man is an abomination to the rich.
SIR.13.21	When a rich man is shaken, he is supported by his friends,
SIR.13.21	but when one of low degree is down, he is pushed away even by his friends.
SIR.13.22	When a rich man falls, there are many helpers.
SIR.13.22	He speaks things not to be spoken, and men justify him.
SIR.13.22	A man of low degree falls, and men rebuke him.
SIR.13.22	He utters wisdom, and is not listened to.
SIR.13.23	A rich man speaks, and all keep silence.
SIR.13.23	They extol what he says to the clouds.
SIR.13.23	A poor man speaks, and they say, “Who is this?”
SIR.13.23	If he stumbles, they will help to overthrow him.
SIR.13.24	Riches are good if they have no sin.
SIR.13.24	Poverty is evil in the mouth of the ungodly.
SIR.13.25	The heart of a man changes his countenance,
SIR.13.25	whether it is for good or for evil.
SIR.13.26	A cheerful countenance is a sign of a prosperous heart.
SIR.13.26	Devising proverbs takes strenuous thinking.
SIR.14.1	Blessed is the man who has not slipped with his mouth,
SIR.14.1	and doesn’t suffer from sorrow for sins.
SIR.14.2	Blessed is he whose soul does not condemn him,
SIR.14.2	and who has not given up hope.
SIR.14.3	Riches are not appropriate for a stingy person.
SIR.14.3	What would an envious man do with money?
SIR.14.4	He who gathers by denying himself gathers for others.
SIR.14.4	Others will revel in his goods.
SIR.14.5	If one is mean to himself, to whom will he be good?
SIR.14.5	He won’t enjoy his possessions.
SIR.14.6	There is none more evil than he who is stingy with himself.
SIR.14.6	This is a punishment for his wickedness.
SIR.14.7	Even if he does good, he does it in forgetfulness.
SIR.14.7	In the end, he reveals his wickedness.
SIR.14.8	A miser is evil.
SIR.14.8	He turns away and disregards souls.
SIR.14.9	A covetous man’s eye is not satisfied with his portion.
SIR.14.9	Wicked injustice dries up his soul.
SIR.14.10	A miser begrudges bread,
SIR.14.10	and it is lacking at his table.
SIR.14.11	My son, according to what you have, treat yourself well,
SIR.14.11	and bring worthy offerings to the Lord.
SIR.14.12	Remember that death will not wait,
SIR.14.12	and that the covenant of Hades hasn’t been shown to you.
SIR.14.13	Do good to your friend before you die.
SIR.14.13	According to your ability, reach out and give to him.
SIR.14.14	Don’t defraud yourself of a good day.
SIR.14.14	Don’t let the portion of a good desire pass you by.
SIR.14.15	Won’t you leave your labours to another,
SIR.14.15	and your toils be divided by lot?
SIR.14.16	Give, take, and treat yourself well,
SIR.14.16	because there is no seeking of luxury in Hades.
SIR.14.17	All flesh grows old like a garment,
SIR.14.17	for the covenant from the beginning is, “You must die.”
SIR.14.18	Like the leaves flourishing on a thick tree,
SIR.14.18	some it sheds, and some grow,
SIR.14.18	so also are the generations of flesh and blood:
SIR.14.18	one comes to an end and another is born.
SIR.14.19	Every work rots and falls away,
SIR.14.19	and its builder will depart with it.
SIR.14.20	Blessed is the man who meditates on wisdom,
SIR.14.20	and who reasons by his understanding.
SIR.14.21	He who considers her ways in his heart
SIR.14.21	will also have knowledge of her secrets.
SIR.14.22	Go after her like one who tracks,
SIR.14.22	and lie in wait in her ways.
SIR.14.23	He who pries in at her windows
SIR.14.23	will also listen at her doors.
SIR.14.24	He who lodges close to her house
SIR.14.24	will also fasten a nail in her walls.
SIR.14.25	He will pitch his tent near at hand to her,
SIR.14.25	and will lodge in a lodging where good things are.
SIR.14.26	He will set his children under her shelter,
SIR.14.26	and will rest under her branches.
SIR.14.27	By her he will be covered from heat,
SIR.14.27	and will lodge in her glory.
SIR.15.1	He who fears the Lord will do this.
SIR.15.1	He who has possession of the law will obtain her.
SIR.15.2	As a mother shall she meet him,
SIR.15.2	and receive him as a wife married in her virginity.
SIR.15.3	She will feed him with bread of understanding
SIR.15.3	and give him water of wisdom to drink.
SIR.15.4	He will be stayed upon her, and will not be moved.
SIR.15.4	He will rely upon her, and will not be confounded.
SIR.15.5	She will exalt him above his neighbours.
SIR.15.5	She will open his mouth in the midst of the congregation.
SIR.15.6	He will inherit joy, a crown of gladness,
SIR.15.6	and an everlasting name.
SIR.15.7	Foolish men will not obtain her.
SIR.15.7	Sinners will not see her.
SIR.15.8	She is far from pride.
SIR.15.8	Liars will not remember her.
SIR.15.9	Praise is not attractive in the mouth of a sinner;
SIR.15.9	for it was not sent to him from the Lord.
SIR.15.10	For praise will be spoken in wisdom;
SIR.15.10	The Lord will prosper it.
SIR.15.11	Don’t say, “It is through the Lord that I fell away;”
SIR.15.11	for you shall not do the things that he hates.
SIR.15.12	Don’t say, “It is he that caused me to err;”
SIR.15.12	for he has no need of a sinful man.
SIR.15.13	The Lord hates every abomination;
SIR.15.13	and those who fear him don’t love them.
SIR.15.14	He himself made man from the beginning
SIR.15.14	and left him in the hand of his own counsel.
SIR.15.15	If you will, you shall keep the commandments.
SIR.15.15	To be faithful is good pleasure.
SIR.15.16	He has set fire and water before you.
SIR.15.16	You will stretch forth your hand to whichever you desire.
SIR.15.17	Before man is life and death.
SIR.15.17	Whichever he likes, it will be given to him.
SIR.15.18	For great is the wisdom of the Lord.
SIR.15.18	He is mighty in power, and sees all things.
SIR.15.19	His eyes are upon those who fear him.
SIR.15.19	He knows every work of man.
SIR.15.20	He has not commanded any man to be ungodly.
SIR.15.20	He has not given any man license to sin.
SIR.16.1	Don’t desire a multitude of unprofitable children,
SIR.16.1	neither delight in ungodly sons.
SIR.16.2	If they multiply, don’t delight in them
SIR.16.2	unless the fear of the Lord is in them.
SIR.16.3	Don’t trust in their life.
SIR.16.3	Don’t rely on their condition:
SIR.16.3	for one is better than a thousand,
SIR.16.3	and to die childless than to have ungodly children.
SIR.16.4	For from one who has understanding, a city will be populated,
SIR.16.4	but a race of wicked men will be made desolate.
SIR.16.5	I have seen many such things with my eyes.
SIR.16.5	My ear has heard mightier things than these.
SIR.16.6	In the congregation of sinners, a fire will be kindled.
SIR.16.6	In a disobedient nation, wrath is kindled.
SIR.16.7	He was not pacified towards the giants of old time,
SIR.16.7	who revolted in their strength.
SIR.16.8	He didn’t spare Lot’s neighbours,
SIR.16.8	whom he abhorred for their pride.
SIR.16.9	He didn’t pity the people of perdition
SIR.16.9	who were taken away in their sins,
SIR.16.10	or in like manner, the six hundred thousand footmen
SIR.16.10	who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts.
SIR.16.11	Even if there is one stiff-necked person,
SIR.16.11	it is a marvel if he will be unpunished,
SIR.16.11	for mercy and wrath are both with him who is mighty to forgive,
SIR.16.11	and he pours out wrath.
SIR.16.12	As his mercy is great, so is his correction also.
SIR.16.12	He judges a man according to his works.
SIR.16.13	The sinner will not escape with plunder.
SIR.16.13	The perseverance of the godly will not be frustrated.
SIR.16.14	He will make room for every work of mercy.
SIR.16.14	Each man will receive according to his works. 
SIR.16.17	Don’t say, “I will be hidden from the Lord,”
SIR.16.17	and “Who will remember me from on high?”
SIR.16.17	I will not be known amongst so many people,
SIR.16.17	for what is my soul in a boundless creation?
SIR.16.18	Behold, the heaven, the heaven of heavens,
SIR.16.18	the deep, and the earth, will be moved when he visits.
SIR.16.19	The mountains and the foundations of the earth together
SIR.16.19	are shaken with trembling when he looks at them.
SIR.16.20	No heart will think about these things.
SIR.16.20	Who could comprehend his ways?
SIR.16.21	Like a tempest which no man can see,
SIR.16.21	Yes, the majority of his works are
SIR.16.22	Who will declare hisworks of righteousness?
SIR.16.22	Who will endure them?
SIR.16.22	For his covenant is afar off.
SIR.16.23	He who is lacking in
SIR.16.23	An unwise and erring man thinks follies.
SIR.16.24	My son, listen to me, learn knowledge,
SIR.16.24	and heed my words with your heart.
SIR.16.25	I will impart instruction with precision,
SIR.16.25	and declare knowledge exactly.
SIR.16.26	In the judgement of the Lord are his works from the beginning.
SIR.16.26	From the making of them he determined their parts.
SIR.16.27	He arranged his works for all time,
SIR.16.27	and their beginnings to their generations.
SIR.16.27	They aren’t hungry or weary,
SIR.16.27	and they don’t cease from their works.
SIR.16.28	No one thrusts aside his neighbour.
SIR.16.28	They will never disobey his word.
SIR.16.29	After this also the Lord looked at the earth
SIR.16.29	and filled it with his blessings.
SIR.16.30	and into it is their return.
SIR.17.1	The Lord created mankind out of the earth,
SIR.17.1	and turned them back to it again.
SIR.17.2	He gave them days by number, and a set time,
SIR.17.2	and gave them authority over the things that are on it.
SIR.17.3	He endowed them with strength proper to them,
SIR.17.3	and made them according to his own image.
SIR.17.4	He put the fear of man upon all flesh,
SIR.17.4	and gave him dominion over beasts and birds. 
SIR.17.6	He gave them counsel, tongue, eyes,
SIR.17.6	ears, and heart to have understanding.
SIR.17.7	He filled them with the knowledge of wisdom,
SIR.17.7	and showed them good and evil.
SIR.17.8	He set his eye upon their hearts,
SIR.17.8	to show them the majesty of his works. 
SIR.17.10	And they will praise the name of his holiness,
SIR.17.11	He added to them knowledge,
SIR.17.11	and gave them a law of life for a heritage.
SIR.17.12	He made an everlasting covenant with them,
SIR.17.12	and showed them his judgements.
SIR.17.13	Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory.
SIR.17.13	Their ears heard the glory of his voice.
SIR.17.14	He said to them, “Beware of all unrighteousness.”
SIR.17.14	So he gave them commandment, each man concerning his neighbour.
SIR.17.15	Their ways are ever before him.
SIR.17.15	They will not be hidden from his eyes. 
SIR.17.17	but Israel is the Lord’s portion. 
SIR.17.19	All their works are as clear as the sun before him.
SIR.17.19	His eyes are continually upon their ways.
SIR.17.20	Their iniquities are not hidden from him.
SIR.17.20	All their sins are before the Lord. 
SIR.17.22	With him the alms of a man is as a signet.
SIR.17.22	He will keep the bounty of a man as the apple of the eye. 
SIR.17.23	Afterwards he will rise up and recompense them,
SIR.17.23	and render their recompense upon their head.
SIR.17.24	However to those who repent he grants a return.
SIR.17.24	He comforts those who are losing patience.
SIR.17.25	Return to the Lord, and forsake sins.
SIR.17.25	Make your prayer before his face offend less.
SIR.17.26	Turn again to the Most High, and turn away from iniquity.
SIR.17.26	Greatly hate the abominable thing.
SIR.17.27	Who will give praise to the Most High in Hades,
SIR.17.27	in place of those who live and return thanks?
SIR.17.28	Thanksgiving perishes from the dead, as from one who doesn’t exist.
SIR.17.28	He who is in life and health will praise the Lord.
SIR.17.29	How great is the mercy of the Lord,
SIR.17.29	and his forgiveness to those who turn to him!
SIR.17.30	For all things can’t be in men,
SIR.17.30	because the son of man is not immortal.
SIR.17.31	What is brighter than the sun? Yet even this fails.
SIR.17.31	An evil man thinks about flesh and blood.
SIR.17.32	He looks upon the power of the height of heaven,
SIR.17.32	while all men are earth and ashes.
SIR.18.1	He who lives forever created all things in common.
SIR.18.2	The Lord alone will be justified. 
SIR.18.4	He has given power to declare his works to no one.
SIR.18.4	Who could trace out his mighty deeds?
SIR.18.5	Who could measure the strength of his majesty?
SIR.18.5	Who could also proclaim his mercies?
SIR.18.6	As for the wondrous works of the Lord, it is not possible to take from them nor add to them,
SIR.18.6	neither is it possible to explore them.
SIR.18.7	When a man has finished, then he is just at the beginning.
SIR.18.7	When he ceases, then he will be in perplexity.
SIR.18.8	What is mankind, and what purpose do they serve?
SIR.18.8	What is their good, and what is their evil?
SIR.18.9	The number of man’s days at the most are a hundred years.
SIR.18.10	As a drop of water from the sea, and a pebble from the sand,
SIR.18.10	so are a few years in the day of eternity.
SIR.18.11	For this cause the Lord was patient over them,
SIR.18.11	and poured out his mercy upon them.
SIR.18.12	He saw and perceived their end, that it is evil.
SIR.18.12	Therefore he multiplied his forgiveness.
SIR.18.13	The mercy of a man is upon his neighbour;
SIR.18.13	but the mercy of the Lord is upon all flesh:
SIR.18.13	reproving, chastening, teaching,
SIR.18.13	and bringing back, as a shepherd does his flock.
SIR.18.14	He has mercy on those who accept chastening,
SIR.18.14	and that diligently seek after his judgements.
SIR.18.15	My son, to your good deeds add no blemish,
SIR.18.15	and no grief of words in any of your giving.
SIR.18.16	Doesn’t the dew relieve the scorching heat?
SIR.18.16	So a word is better than a gift.
SIR.18.17	Behold, isn’t a word better than a gift?
SIR.18.17	Both are with a gracious man.
SIR.18.18	A fool is ungracious and abusive.
SIR.18.18	The gift of an envious man consumes the eyes.
SIR.18.19	Learn before you speak.
SIR.18.19	Take care of your health before you are sick.
SIR.18.20	Before judgement examine yourself,
SIR.18.20	and in the hour of visitation you will find forgiveness.
SIR.18.21	Humble yourself before you become sick.
SIR.18.21	In the time of sins, show repentance.
SIR.18.22	Let nothing hinder you to pay your vow in due time.
SIR.18.22	Don’t wait until death to be justified.
SIR.18.23	Before you make a vow, prepare yourself.
SIR.18.23	Don’t be like a man who tempts the Lord.
SIR.18.24	Think about the wrath coming in the days of the end,
SIR.18.24	and the time of vengeance, when he turns away his face.
SIR.18.25	In the days of fullness remember the time of hunger.
SIR.18.25	Remember poverty and lack in the days of wealth.
SIR.18.26	From morning until evening, the time changes.
SIR.18.26	All things are speedy before the Lord.
SIR.18.27	A wise man is cautious in everything.
SIR.18.27	In days of sinning, he will beware of offence.
SIR.18.28	Every man of understanding knows wisdom.
SIR.18.28	He will give thanks to him who found her.
SIR.18.29	They who were of understanding in sayings also became wise themselves,
SIR.18.29	and poured out apt proverbs.
SIR.18.30	Don’t go after your lusts.
SIR.18.30	Refrain yourself from your appetites.
SIR.18.31	If you give fully to your soul the delight of her desire,
SIR.18.31	she will make you
SIR.18.32	Don’t make merry in much luxury,
SIR.18.32	neither be tied to the expense thereof.
SIR.18.33	Don’t be made a beggar by banqueting upon borrowing
SIR.18.33	when you have nothing in your purse.
SIR.19.1	A workman who is a drunkard will not become rich.
SIR.19.1	He who despises small things will fall little by little.
SIR.19.2	Wine and women will make men of understanding fall away.
SIR.19.2	And he who joins with prostitutes will be more reckless.
SIR.19.3	Moths and worms will have him as their heritage.
SIR.19.3	A reckless soul will be taken away.
SIR.19.4	He who is hasty to trust is shallow-hearted.
SIR.19.4	He who sins will offend against his own soul.
SIR.19.5	He who makes merry in his heart will be condemned:
SIR.19.7	Never repeat what is told you,
SIR.19.7	and you won’t be lacking.
SIR.19.8	Whether it is of friend or foe, don’t tell it.
SIR.19.8	Unless it is a sin to you, don’t reveal it.
SIR.19.9	For he has heard you and observed you,
SIR.19.9	and when the time comes, he will hate you.
SIR.19.10	Have you heard a word? Let it die with you.
SIR.19.10	Be of good courage: it will not burst you.
SIR.19.11	A fool will travail in pain with a word,
SIR.19.11	as a woman in labour with a child.
SIR.19.12	As an arrow that sticks in the flesh of the thigh,
SIR.19.12	so is a word in a fool’s belly.
SIR.19.13	Reprove a friend; it may be he didn’t do it.
SIR.19.13	If he did something, it may be that he may do it no more.
SIR.19.14	Reprove your neighbour; it may be he didn’t say it.
SIR.19.14	If he has said it, it may be that he may not say it again.
SIR.19.15	Reprove a friend; for many times there is slander.
SIR.19.15	Don’t trust every word.
SIR.19.16	There is one who slips, and not from the heart.
SIR.19.16	Who is he who hasn’t sinned with his tongue?
SIR.19.17	Reprove your neighbour before you threaten him;
SIR.19.17	and give place to the law of the Most High. 
SIR.19.20	All wisdom is the fear of the Lord.
SIR.19.20	In all wisdom is the doing of the law. 
SIR.19.22	The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom.
SIR.19.22	The prudence of sinners is not counsel.
SIR.19.23	There is a wickedness, and it is abomination.
SIR.19.23	There is a fool lacking in wisdom.
SIR.19.24	Better is one who has small understanding, and fears,
SIR.19.24	than one who has much prudence, and transgresses the law.
SIR.19.25	There is an exquisite subtlety, and it is unjust.
SIR.19.25	And there is one who perverts favour to gain a judgement.
SIR.19.26	There is one who does wickedly, who hangs down his head with mourning;
SIR.19.26	but inwardly he is full of deceit,
SIR.19.27	bowing down his face, and making as if he were deaf of one ear.
SIR.19.27	Where he isn’t known, he will be beforehand with you.
SIR.19.28	And if for lack of power he is hindered from sinning,
SIR.19.28	if he find opportunity, he will do mischief.
SIR.19.29	A man will be known by his look,
SIR.19.29	One who has understanding will be known by his face, when you meet him.
SIR.19.30	A man’s attire, grinning laughter,
SIR.19.30	and gait show what he is.
SIR.20.1	There is a reproof that is not timely;
SIR.20.1	and there is a man who keeps silent and is wise.
SIR.20.2	How good is it to reprove, rather than to be angry.
SIR.20.2	He who confesses will be kept back from hurt. 
SIR.20.4	As is the lust of a eunuch to deflower a virgin,
SIR.20.4	so is he who executes judgements with violence.
SIR.20.5	There is one who keeps silent and is found wise;
SIR.20.5	and there is one who is hated for his much talk.
SIR.20.6	There is one who keeps silent, for he has no answer to make;
SIR.20.6	And there is one who keeps silent, as knowing his time.
SIR.20.7	A wise man will be silent until his time has come,
SIR.20.7	but the braggart and fool will miss his time.
SIR.20.8	He who uses many words will be abhorred.
SIR.20.8	He who takes authority for himself will be hated in it.
SIR.20.9	There is a prosperity that a man finds in misfortunes;
SIR.20.9	And there is a gain that turns to loss.
SIR.20.10	There is a gift that will not profit you;
SIR.20.10	and there is a gift pays back double.
SIR.20.11	There is an abasement because of glory;
SIR.20.11	and there is one who has lifted up his head from a low estate.
SIR.20.12	There is one who buys much for a little,
SIR.20.12	and pays for it again sevenfold.
SIR.20.13	He who is wise in words will make himself beloved;
SIR.20.13	but the pleasantries of fools will be wasted.
SIR.20.14	The gift of a fool will not profit you;
SIR.20.14	for his eyes are many instead of one.
SIR.20.15	He will give little and insult much.
SIR.20.15	He will open his mouth like a crier.
SIR.20.15	Today he will lend, and tomorrow he will ask for it back.
SIR.20.15	Such a one is a hateful man.
SIR.20.16	The fool will say, “I have no friend,
SIR.20.16	and I have no thanks for my good deeds.
SIR.20.16	They who eat my bread are of evil tongue.”
SIR.20.17	How often, and of how many, will he be laughed to scorn! 
SIR.20.18	A slip on a pavement is better than a slip with the tongue.
SIR.20.18	So the fall of the wicked will come speedily.
SIR.20.19	A man without grace is a tale out of season.
SIR.20.19	It will be continually in the mouth of the ignorant.
SIR.20.20	A parable from a fool’s mouth will be rejected;
SIR.20.20	for he will not speak it in its season.
SIR.20.21	There is one who is hindered from sinning through lack.
SIR.20.21	When he rests, he will not be troubled.
SIR.20.22	There is one who destroys his soul through bashfulness.
SIR.20.22	By a foolish countenance, he will destroy it.
SIR.20.23	There is one who for bashfulness makes promises to his friend;
SIR.20.23	and he makes him his enemy for nothing.
SIR.20.24	A lie is a foul blot in a man.
SIR.20.24	It will be continually in the mouth of the ignorant.
SIR.20.25	A thief is better than a man who is continually lying,
SIR.20.25	but they both will inherit destruction.
SIR.20.26	The disposition of a liar is dishonour.
SIR.20.26	His shame is with him continually.
SIR.20.27	He who is wise in words will advance himself.
SIR.20.27	And one who is prudent will please great men.
SIR.20.28	He who tills his land will raise his heap high.
SIR.20.28	He who pleases great men will get pardon for iniquity.
SIR.20.29	Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise,
SIR.20.29	and as a muzzle on the mouth, turn away reproofs.
SIR.20.30	Wisdom that is hidden, and treasure that is out of sight,
SIR.20.30	what profit is in them both?
SIR.20.31	Better is a man who hides his folly
SIR.20.31	than a man who hides his wisdom. 
SIR.21.1	My son, have you sinned?
SIR.21.1	Add no more to it;
SIR.21.1	and ask forgiveness for your past sins.
SIR.21.2	Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent;
SIR.21.2	for if you draw near, it will bite you.
SIR.21.2	Its teeth are lion’s teeth,
SIR.21.2	slaying men’s souls.
SIR.21.3	All iniquity is as a two-edged sword.
SIR.21.3	Its stroke has no healing.
SIR.21.4	Terror and violence will lay waste riches.
SIR.21.4	So the house of an arrogant man will be laid waste.
SIR.21.5	Supplication from a poor man’s mouth reaches to the ears of
SIR.21.5	and his judgement comes speedily.
SIR.21.6	One who hates reproof is in the path of the sinner.
SIR.21.6	He who fears the Lord will turn again in his heart.
SIR.21.7	He who is mighty in tongue is known far away;
SIR.21.7	but the man of understanding knows when he slips.
SIR.21.8	He who builds his house with other men’s money
SIR.21.8	is like one who gathers stones for his own tomb.
SIR.21.9	The congregation of wicked men is as a bundle of tow
SIR.21.9	with a flame of fire at the end of them.
SIR.21.10	The way of sinners is paved with stones;
SIR.21.10	and at the end of it is the pit of Hades.
SIR.21.11	He who keeps the law becomes master of its intent.
SIR.21.11	The end of the fear of the Lord is wisdom.
SIR.21.12	He who is not clever will not be instructed.
SIR.21.12	There is a cleverness which makes bitterness abound.
SIR.21.13	The knowledge of a wise man will be made to abound as a flood,
SIR.21.13	and his counsel as a fountain of life.
SIR.21.14	The inward parts of a fool are like a broken vessel.
SIR.21.14	He will hold no knowledge.
SIR.21.15	If a man of knowledge hears a wise word,
SIR.21.15	he will commend it and add to it.
SIR.21.15	The wanton man hears it, and it displeases him,
SIR.21.15	so he puts it away behind his back.
SIR.21.16	The discourse of a fool is like a burden in the way,
SIR.21.16	but grace will be found on the lips of the wise.
SIR.21.17	The mouth of the prudent man will be sought for in the congregation.
SIR.21.17	They will ponder his words in their heart.
SIR.21.18	As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool.
SIR.21.18	The knowledge of an unwise man is 
SIR.21.19	Instruction is as fetters on the feet of an unwise man,
SIR.21.19	and as manacles on the right hand.
SIR.21.20	A fool lifts up his voice with laughter,
SIR.21.20	but a clever man smiles quietly.
SIR.21.21	Instruction is to a prudent man as an ornament of gold,
SIR.21.21	and as a bracelet upon his right arm.
SIR.21.22	The foot of a fool rushes into a house,
SIR.21.22	but a man of experience will be ashamed of entering.
SIR.21.23	A foolish man peers into the door of a house,
SIR.21.23	but a man who is instructed will stand outside.
SIR.21.24	It is a lack of instruction in a man to listen at a door,
SIR.21.24	but a prudent man will be grieved with the disgrace.
SIR.21.25	but the words of prudent men will be weighed in the balance.
SIR.21.26	The heart of fools is in their mouth,
SIR.21.26	but the mouth of wise men is their heart.
SIR.21.27	When the ungodly curses Satan,
SIR.21.27	he curses his own soul.
SIR.21.28	A whisperer defiles his own soul,
SIR.21.28	and will be hated wherever he travels.
SIR.22.1	A slothful man is compared to a stone that is defiled.
SIR.22.1	Everyone will at hiss him in his disgrace.
SIR.22.2	A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill.
SIR.22.2	Every man who takes it up will shake out his hand.
SIR.22.3	An uninstructed child is a disgrace to his father,
SIR.22.3	and a foolish daughter is born to his loss.
SIR.22.4	A prudent daughter will inherit a husband of her own.
SIR.22.4	She who brings shame is the grief of her father.
SIR.22.5	She who is bold brings shame upon father and husband.
SIR.22.5	She will be despised by both of them.
SIR.22.6	Unseasonable discourse is as music in mourning,
SIR.22.6	but stripes and correction are wisdom in every season.
SIR.22.7	He who teaches a fool is as one who glues a potsherd together,
SIR.22.7	even as one who wakes a sleeper out of a deep sleep.
SIR.22.8	He who teaches a fool is as one who teaches a man who slumbers.
SIR.22.8	In the end he will say, “What is it?” 
SIR.22.11	Weep for the dead, for he lacks light.
SIR.22.11	Weep for a fool, for he lacks understanding.
SIR.22.11	Weep more sweetly for the dead, because he has found rest,
SIR.22.11	but the life of the fool is worse than death.
SIR.22.12	Mourning for the dead lasts seven days,
SIR.22.12	but for a fool and an ungodly man, all the days of his life.
SIR.22.13	Don’t talk much with a foolish man,
SIR.22.13	and don’t go to one that has no understanding:
SIR.22.13	Beware of him, lest you have trouble and be defiled in his onslaught.
SIR.22.13	Turn away from him, and you will find rest,
SIR.22.13	and you won’t be wearied in his madness.
SIR.22.14	What would be heavier than lead?
SIR.22.14	What is its name, but a fool?
SIR.22.15	Sand, salt, and a mass of iron is easier to bear
SIR.22.15	than a man without understanding.
SIR.22.16	Timber girded and bound into a building will not be released with shaking.
SIR.22.16	So a heart established in due season on well advised counsel will not be afraid.
SIR.22.17	A heart settled upon a thoughtful understanding
SIR.22.17	is as an ornament of plaster on a polished wall.
SIR.22.18	Fences set on a high place will not stand against the wind;
SIR.22.18	so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool will not stand against any fear.
SIR.22.19	He who pricks the eye will make tears fall.
SIR.22.19	He who pricks the heart makes it show feeling.
SIR.22.20	Whoever casts a stone at birds scares them away.
SIR.22.20	He who insults a friend will dissolve friendship.
SIR.22.21	If you have drawn a sword against a friend, don’t despair,
SIR.22.21	for there may be a way back.
SIR.22.22	If you have opened your mouth against a friend, don’t be afraid,
SIR.22.22	for there may be reconciliation,
SIR.22.22	unless it is for insulting, arrogance, disclosing of a secret, or a treacherous blow—
SIR.22.22	for these things any friend will flee.
SIR.22.23	Gain trust with your neighbour in his poverty,
SIR.22.23	that in his prosperity you may have gladness.
SIR.22.23	Stay steadfast to him in the time of his affliction,
SIR.22.23	that you may be heir with him in his inheritance.
SIR.22.24	Before fire is the vapour and smoke of a furnace,
SIR.22.24	so insults precede bloodshed.
SIR.22.25	I won’t be ashamed to shelter a friend.
SIR.22.25	I won’t hide myself from his face:
SIR.22.26	If any evil happen to me because of him,
SIR.22.26	everyone that hears it will beware of him.
SIR.22.27	Who will set a watch over my mouth,
SIR.22.27	and a seal of shrewdness upon my lips,
SIR.22.27	that I don’t fall from it, and that my tongue not destroy me?
SIR.23.1	O Lord, Father and Master of my life,
SIR.23.1	don’t abandon me to their counsel.
SIR.23.1	Don’t let me fall by them.
SIR.23.2	Who will set scourges over my thought,
SIR.23.2	and a discipline of wisdom over my heart,
SIR.23.2	that they spare me not for my errors,
SIR.23.2	and not overlook their sins?
SIR.23.3	Otherwise my errors might be multiplied,
SIR.23.3	and my sins abound,
SIR.23.3	I fall before my adversaries,
SIR.23.3	and my enemy rejoice over me.
SIR.23.4	O Lord, Father and God of my life,
SIR.23.4	don’t give me a haughty eyes,
SIR.23.5	and turn away evil desire from me.
SIR.23.6	Let neither gluttony nor lust overtake me.
SIR.23.6	Don’t give me over to a shameless mind.
SIR.23.7	Listen, my children, to the discipline of the mouth.
SIR.23.7	He who keeps it will not be taken.
SIR.23.8	The sinner will be overpowered through his lips.
SIR.23.8	By them, the insulter and the arrogant will stumble.
SIR.23.9	Don’t accustom your mouth to an oath,
SIR.23.9	and don’t be accustomed to naming the Holy One,
SIR.23.10	for as a servant who is continually scourged will not lack a bruise,
SIR.23.10	so he also who swears and continually utters the Name will not be cleansed from sin.
SIR.23.11	A man of many oaths will be filled with iniquity.
SIR.23.11	The scourge will not depart from his house.
SIR.23.11	If he offends, his sin will be upon him.
SIR.23.11	If he disregards it, he has sinned doubly.
SIR.23.11	If he has sworn in vain, he will not be justified,
SIR.23.11	for his house will be filled with calamities.
SIR.23.12	There is a manner of speech that is clothed with death.
SIR.23.12	Let it not be found in the heritage of Jacob,
SIR.23.12	for all these things will be far from the godly,
SIR.23.12	and they will not wallow in sins.
SIR.23.13	Don’t accustom your mouth to gross rudeness,
SIR.23.13	for it involves sinful speech.
SIR.23.14	Remember your father and your mother,
SIR.23.14	for you sit in the midst of great men,
SIR.23.14	that you be not forgetful before them,
SIR.23.14	and become a fool by your custom;
SIR.23.14	so you may wish that you had not been born,
SIR.23.14	and curse the day of your nativity.
SIR.23.15	A man wha is accustomed to words of reproach
SIR.23.15	won’t be corrected all the days of his life.
SIR.23.16	Two sorts of people multiply sins,
SIR.23.16	and the third will bring wrath:
SIR.23.16	a hot mind, as a burning fire, will not be quenched until it is consumed;
SIR.23.16	a fornicator in the body of his flesh will never cease until he has burnt out the fire.
SIR.23.17	All bread is sweet to a fornicator.
SIR.23.17	He will not cease util he dies.
SIR.23.18	A man who goes astray from his own bed,
SIR.23.18	says in his heart, “Who sees me?
SIR.23.18	Darkness is around me, and the walls hide me.
SIR.23.18	No one sees me. Of whom am I afraid?
SIR.23.18	The Most High will not remember my sins.”
SIR.23.19	The eyes of men are his terror.
SIR.23.19	He doesn’t know that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun,
SIR.23.19	seeing all the ways of men,
SIR.23.19	and looking into secret places.
SIR.23.20	All things were known to him before they were created,
SIR.23.20	and in also after they were completed.
SIR.23.21	This man will be punished in the streets of the city.
SIR.23.21	He will be seized where he least expects it.
SIR.23.22	So also is a wife who leaves her husband,
SIR.23.22	and brings in an heir by a stranger.
SIR.23.23	For first, she was disobedient in the law of the Most High.
SIR.23.23	Second, she trespassed against her own husband.
SIR.23.23	Third, she played the adulteress in whoredom,
SIR.23.23	and brought in children by a stranger.
SIR.23.24	She shall be brought out into the congregation.
SIR.23.24	Her punishment will extend to her children.
SIR.23.25	Her children will not take root.
SIR.23.25	Her branches will bear no fruit.
SIR.23.26	She will leave her memory for a curse.
SIR.23.26	Her reproach won’t be blotted out.
SIR.23.27	And those who are left behind will know that there is nothing better than the fear of the Lord,
SIR.23.27	and nothing sweeter than to heed the commandments of the Lord. 
SIR.24.1	Wisdom will praise her own soul,
SIR.24.1	and will proclaim her glory in the midst of her people.
SIR.24.2	She will open her mouth in the congregation of the Most High,
SIR.24.2	and proclaim her glory in the presence of his power.
SIR.24.3	“I came out of the mouth of the Most High,
SIR.24.3	and covered the earth as a mist.
SIR.24.4	I lived in high places,
SIR.24.4	and my throne is in the pillar of the cloud.
SIR.24.5	Alone I surrounded the circuit of heaven,
SIR.24.5	and walked in the depth of the abyss.
SIR.24.6	In the waves of the sea, and in all the earth,
SIR.24.6	and in every people and nation, I got a possession.
SIR.24.7	With all these I sought rest.
SIR.24.7	In whose inheritance shall I lodge?
SIR.24.8	Then the Creator of all things gave me a commandment.
SIR.24.8	He who created me made my tabernacle to rest,
SIR.24.8	and said, ‘Let your tabernacle be in Jacob,
SIR.24.8	and your inheritance in Israel.’
SIR.24.9	He created me from the beginning before the world.
SIR.24.9	For all ages, I will not cease to exist.
SIR.24.10	In the holy tabernacle, I ministered before him.
SIR.24.10	So I was established in Zion.
SIR.24.11	In the beloved city, likewise he gave me rest.
SIR.24.11	In Jerusalem was my domain.
SIR.24.12	I took root in a people that was glorified,
SIR.24.12	even in the portion of the Lord’s own inheritance.
SIR.24.13	I was exalted like a cedar in Lebanon,
SIR.24.13	And like a cypress tree on the mountains of Hermon.
SIR.24.14	I was exalted like a palm tree on the sea shore,
SIR.24.14	and as rose plants in Jericho,
SIR.24.14	and as a fair olive tree in the plain.
SIR.24.14	I was exalted as a plane tree.
SIR.24.15	As cinnamon and aspalathus, I have given a scent to perfumes.
SIR.24.15	As choice myrrh, I spread abroad a pleasant fragrance,
SIR.24.15	as
SIR.24.15	and as the smell of frankincense in the tabernacle.
SIR.24.16	As the terebinth, I stretched out my branches.
SIR.24.16	My branches are branches of glory and grace.
SIR.24.17	As the vine, I put forth grace.
SIR.24.17	My flowers are the fruit of glory and riches. 
SIR.24.19	“Come to me, all you who desire me,
SIR.24.19	and be filled with my fruits.
SIR.24.20	For my memorial is sweeter than honey,
SIR.24.20	and my inheritance than the honeycomb.
SIR.24.21	Those who eat me will be hungry for more.
SIR.24.21	Those who drink me will be thirsty for more.
SIR.24.22	He who obeys me will not be ashamed.
SIR.24.22	Those who work in me will not sin.”
SIR.24.23	All these things are the book of the covenant of the Most High God,
SIR.24.23	the law which Moses commanded us for an inheritance for the assemblies of Jacob. 
SIR.24.25	It is he who makes wisdom abundant, as Pishon,
SIR.24.25	and as Tigris in the days of first fruits.
SIR.24.26	He makes understanding full as Euphrates,
SIR.24.26	and as Jordan in the days of harvest,
SIR.24.27	who makes instruction shine forth as the light,
SIR.24.27	as Gihon in the days of vintage.
SIR.24.28	The first man didn’t know her perfectly.
SIR.24.28	In like manner, the last has not explored her.
SIR.24.29	For her thoughts are filled from the sea,
SIR.24.29	and her counsels from the great deep.
SIR.24.30	I came out as a canal stream from a river,
SIR.24.30	and as an irrigation ditch into a garden.
SIR.24.31	I said, “I will water my garden,
SIR.24.31	and will drench my garden bed.”
SIR.24.31	Behold, my stream became a river,
SIR.24.31	and my river became a sea.
SIR.24.32	I will yet bring instruction to light as the morning,
SIR.24.32	and will make these things clear from far away.
SIR.24.33	I will continue to pour out doctrine like prophecy,
SIR.24.33	and leave it to generations of ages.
SIR.24.34	Behold that I have not laboured for myself only,
SIR.24.34	but for all those who diligently seek her.
SIR.25.1	In three things I was beautified,
SIR.25.1	and stood up beautiful before the Lord and men:
SIR.25.1	the concord of kindred, and friendship of neighbours,
SIR.25.1	and a woman and her husband who walk together in agreement.
SIR.25.2	But my soul hates three sorts of people,
SIR.25.2	and I am greatly offended at their life:
SIR.25.2	a poor man who is arrogant, and a rich man who is a liar,
SIR.25.2	and an old man who is an adulterer lacking understanding.
SIR.25.3	If you gathered nothing in your youth,
SIR.25.3	how could you find anything in your old age?
SIR.25.4	How beautiful a thing is judgement for grey hairs,
SIR.25.4	and for elders to know counsel!
SIR.25.5	How beautiful is the wisdom of old men,
SIR.25.5	and thought and counsel to men who are in honour!
SIR.25.6	Much experience is the crown of old men.
SIR.25.6	Their glory is the fear of the Lord.
SIR.25.7	There are nine things that I have thought of, and in my heart counted happy,
SIR.25.7	and the tenth I will utter with my tongue:
SIR.25.7	a man who has joy of his children,
SIR.25.7	a man who lives and sees the fall of his enemies.
SIR.25.8	Happy is he who dwells with a wife of understanding,
SIR.25.8	he who has not slipped with his tongue,
SIR.25.8	Aad he who has not served a man who is unworthy of him.
SIR.25.9	Happy is he who has found prudence,
SIR.25.9	and he who speaks in the ears of those who listen.
SIR.25.10	How great is he who has found wisdom!
SIR.25.10	Yet is there none above him who fears the Lord.
SIR.25.11	The fear of the Lord passes all things.
SIR.25.11	To whom shall he who holds it be likened? 
SIR.25.13	Any plague but a plague of the heart!
SIR.25.13	Any wickedness but the wickedness of a woman!
SIR.25.14	Any calamity, but a calamity from those who hate me!
SIR.25.14	Any vengeance, but the vengeance of enemies!
SIR.25.15	There is no head above the head of a serpent.
SIR.25.15	There is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy.
SIR.25.16	I would rather dwell with a lion and a dragon
SIR.25.16	than keep house with a wicked woman.
SIR.25.17	The wickedness of a woman changes her appearance,
SIR.25.17	and darkens her countenance like that of a bear.
SIR.25.18	Her husband will sit amongst his neighbours,
SIR.25.18	and when he hears it, he sighs bitterly.
SIR.25.19	All malice is small compared to the malice of a woman.
SIR.25.19	Let the portion of a sinner fall on her.
SIR.25.20	As walking up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged,
SIR.25.20	so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.
SIR.25.21	Don’t throw yourself upon the beauty of a woman.
SIR.25.21	Don’t desire a woman for her beauty.
SIR.25.22	There is anger, impudence, and great reproach
SIR.25.22	if a woman supports her husband.
SIR.25.23	A wicked woman is abasement of heart,
SIR.25.23	sadness of countenance, and a wounded heart.
SIR.25.23	A woman who won’t make her husband happy
SIR.25.23	is like hands that hang down, and palsied knees.
SIR.25.24	The beginning of sin came from a woman.
SIR.25.24	Because of her, we all die.
SIR.25.25	Don’t give water an outlet,
SIR.25.25	and don’t give a wicked woman freedom of speech.
SIR.25.26	If she doesn’t go as you direct,
SIR.25.26	cut her off from your flesh.
SIR.26.1	Happy is the husband of a good wife;
SIR.26.1	And the number of his days will be doubled.
SIR.26.2	A brave woman rejoices her husband;
SIR.26.2	And he will fulfil his years in peace.
SIR.26.3	A good wife is a good portion:
SIR.26.3	She will be given in the portion of such as fear the Lord.
SIR.26.4	Whether a man be rich or poor,
SIR.26.4	A good heart 
SIR.26.5	Of three things my heart was afraid;
SIR.26.5	And concerning the fourth
SIR.26.5	The slander of a city, and the assembly of a multitude, and a false accusation:
SIR.26.5	All these are more grievous than death.
SIR.26.6	A grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous of 
SIR.26.6	And the scourge of a tongue communicating to all.
SIR.26.7	A wicked woman is 
SIR.26.7	He that takes hold of her is as one that grasps a scorpion.
SIR.26.8	A drunken woman 
SIR.26.8	And she will not cover her own shame.
SIR.26.9	The whoredom of a woman is in the lifting up of her eyes;
SIR.26.9	And it will be known by her eyelids.
SIR.26.10	Keep strict watch on a headstrong daughter,
SIR.26.10	Lest she find liberty for herself, and use it.
SIR.26.11	Look well after an impudent eye;
SIR.26.11	And marvel not if it trespass against you.
SIR.26.12	She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller,
SIR.26.12	And drink of every water that is near:
SIR.26.12	She will sit down at every post,
SIR.26.12	And open her quiver against 
SIR.26.13	The grace of a wife will delight her husband;
SIR.26.13	And her knowledge will fatten his bones.
SIR.26.14	A silent woman is a gift of the Lord;
SIR.26.14	And there is nothing worth so much as a well-instructed soul.
SIR.26.15	A shamefast woman is grace upon grace;
SIR.26.15	And there is no
SIR.26.16	As the sun when it arises in the highest places of the Lord,
SIR.26.16	So is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of
SIR.26.17	As the lamp that shines upon the holy candlestick,
SIR.26.17	So is the beauty of the face in ripe age.
SIR.26.18	As the golden pillars are upon a base of silver,
SIR.26.18	So are beautiful feet with the breasts of one that is steadfast. 
SIR.26.28	For two things my heart is grieved;
SIR.26.28	And for the third anger comes upon me:
SIR.26.28	A man of war that suffers for poverty;
SIR.26.28	And men of understanding that are counted as refuse:
SIR.26.28	One that turns back from righteousness to sin;
SIR.26.28	The Lord will prepare him for the sword.
SIR.26.29	A merchant shall hardly keep himself from wrong doing;
SIR.26.29	And a huckster will not be acquitted of sin.
SIR.27.1	Many have sinned for a thing indifferent;
SIR.27.1	And he that seeks to multiply 
SIR.27.2	A nail will stick fast between the joinings of stones;
SIR.27.2	And sin will
SIR.27.3	Unless 
SIR.27.3	His house will soon be overthrown.
SIR.27.4	In the shaking of a sieve, the refuse remains;
SIR.27.4	So the filth of man in his reasoning.
SIR.27.5	The furnace will prove the potter’s vessels;
SIR.27.5	And the trial of a man is in his reasoning.
SIR.27.6	The fruit of a tree declares the husbandry thereof;
SIR.27.6	So is the utterance of the thought of the heart of a man.
SIR.27.7	Praise no man before 
SIR.27.7	For this is the trial of men.
SIR.27.8	If you follow righteousness, you will obtain her,
SIR.27.8	And put her on, as a long robe of glory.
SIR.27.9	Birds will return to their like;
SIR.27.9	And truth will return to those who practise her.
SIR.27.10	The lion lies in wait for prey;
SIR.27.10	So does sin for those who work iniquity.
SIR.27.11	The discourse of a godly man is always wisdom:
SIR.27.11	But the foolish man changes as the moon.
SIR.27.12	Amongst men void of understanding observe the opportunity;
SIR.27.12	But stay continually amongst the thoughtful.
SIR.27.13	The discourse of fools is an offence;
SIR.27.13	And their laughter is in the wantonness of sin.
SIR.27.14	The talk of a man of many oaths will make the hair stand upright;
SIR.27.14	And their strife makes one stop his ears.
SIR.27.15	The strife of the proud is a shedding of blood;
SIR.27.15	And their reviling of each other is a grievous thing to hear.
SIR.27.16	He that reveals secrets destroys credit,
SIR.27.16	And will not find a friend to his mind.
SIR.27.17	Love a friend, and keep faith with him:
SIR.27.17	But if you reveal his secrets,
SIR.27.17	You shall not pursue after him;
SIR.27.18	For as a man has destroyed his enemy,
SIR.27.18	So have you destroyed the friendship of your neighbour.
SIR.27.19	And as a bird which you have released out of your hand,
SIR.27.19	So have you let your neighbour go, and you will not catch him again:
SIR.27.20	Pursue him not, for he is gone far away,
SIR.27.20	And has escaped as a gazelle out of the snare.
SIR.27.21	For a wound may be bound up, and after reviling there may be a reconcilement;
SIR.27.21	But he that reveals secrets has lost hope.
SIR.27.22	One that winks with the eye contrives evil things;
SIR.27.22	And no man will remove him from it.
SIR.27.23	When you are present, he will speak sweetly,
SIR.27.23	And will admire your words;
SIR.27.23	But afterward he will writhe his mouth,
SIR.27.23	And set a trap 
SIR.27.24	I have hated many things, but nothing like him;
SIR.27.24	And the Lord will hate him.
SIR.27.25	One that casts a stone on high casts it on his own head;
SIR.27.25	And a deceitful stroke will open wounds.
SIR.27.26	He that digs a pit will fall into it;
SIR.27.26	And he that sets a snare will be taken therein.
SIR.27.27	He that does evil things, they will roll upon him,
SIR.27.27	And he will not know whence they have come to him.
SIR.27.28	Mockery and reproach are from the arrogant;
SIR.27.28	And vengeance, as a lion, will lie in wait for him.
SIR.27.29	They that rejoice at the fall of the godly will be taken in a snare;
SIR.27.29	And anguish will consume them before they die.
SIR.27.30	Wrath and anger, these also are abominations;
SIR.27.30	And a sinful man will possess them.
SIR.28.1	He that takes vengeance will find vengeance from the Lord;
SIR.28.1	And he will surely make firm his sins.
SIR.28.2	Forgive your neighbour the hurt that he has done 
SIR.28.2	And then your sins will be pardoned when you pray.
SIR.28.3	Man cherishes anger against man;
SIR.28.3	And does he seek healing from the Lord?
SIR.28.4	Upon a man like himself he has no mercy;
SIR.28.4	And does he make supplication for his own sins?
SIR.28.5	He being himself flesh nourishes wrath:
SIR.28.5	Who will make atonement for his sins?
SIR.28.6	Remember your last end, and cease from enmity:
SIR.28.7	Remember the commandments, and be not angry with your neighbour;
SIR.28.7	And 
SIR.28.8	Abstain from strife, and you will diminish your sins:
SIR.28.8	For a passionate man will kindle strife;
SIR.28.9	And a man that is a sinner will trouble friends,
SIR.28.9	And will make debate amongst those who are at peace.
SIR.28.10	And as the stoutness of the strife is, 
SIR.28.10	As is the strength of the man, 
SIR.28.10	And as is his wealth, 
SIR.28.11	A contention begun in haste kindles a fire;
SIR.28.11	And a hasty fighting sheds blood.
SIR.28.12	If you blow a spark, it will burn;
SIR.28.12	And if you spit upon it, it will be quenched:
SIR.28.12	And both these shall come out of your mouth.
SIR.28.13	Curse the whisperer and double-tongued:
SIR.28.13	For he has destroyed many that were at peace.
SIR.28.14	A third person’s tongue has shaken many,
SIR.28.14	And dispersed them from nation to nation;
SIR.28.14	And it has pulled down strong cities,
SIR.28.14	And overthrown the houses of great men.
SIR.28.15	A third person’s tongue has cast out brave women,
SIR.28.15	And deprived them of their labours.
SIR.28.16	He that listens to it will not find rest,
SIR.28.16	Nor shall he dwell quietly.
SIR.28.17	The stroke of a whip makes a mark in the flesh;
SIR.28.17	But the stroke of a tongue will break bones.
SIR.28.18	Many have fallen by the edge of the sword:
SIR.28.18	Yet not so many as those who have fallen because of the tongue.
SIR.28.19	Happy is he that is sheltered from it,
SIR.28.19	That has not passed through the wrath thereof;
SIR.28.19	That has not drawn its yoke,
SIR.28.19	And has not been bound with its bands.
SIR.28.20	For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron,
SIR.28.20	And the bands thereof are bands of brass.
SIR.28.21	The death thereof is an evil death;
SIR.28.21	And Hades were better than it.
SIR.28.22	It shall not have rule over godly men;
SIR.28.22	And they shall not be burnt in its flame.
SIR.28.23	They that forsake the Lord shall fall into it;
SIR.28.23	And it shall burn amongst them, and shall not be quenched:
SIR.28.23	It shall be sent forth upon them as a lion;
SIR.28.23	And as a leopard it shall destroy them.
SIR.28.24	Look that you hedge your possession about with thorns;
SIR.28.24	Bind up your silver and your gold;
SIR.28.25	And make a balance and a weight for your words;
SIR.28.25	And make a door and a bar for your mouth.
SIR.28.26	Take heed lest you slip therein;
SIR.28.26	Lest you fall before one that lies in wait.
SIR.29.1	He that shows mercy will lend to his neighbour;
SIR.29.1	And he that strengthens him with his hand keeps the commandments.
SIR.29.2	Lend to your neighbour in time of his need;
SIR.29.2	And pay you your neighbour again in due season.
SIR.29.3	Confirm your word, and keep faith with him;
SIR.29.3	And at all seasons you shall find what you need.
SIR.29.4	Many have reckoned a loan as a windfall,
SIR.29.4	And have given trouble to those that helped them.
SIR.29.5	Till he has received, he will kiss a man’s hands;
SIR.29.5	And for his neighbour’s money he will speak submissly:
SIR.29.5	And when payment is due, he will prolong the time,
SIR.29.5	And return words of heaviness, and complain of
SIR.29.6	If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half;
SIR.29.6	And he will count it as a windfall:
SIR.29.6	If not, he has deprived him of his money,
SIR.29.6	And he has gotten him for an enemy without cause:
SIR.29.6	He will pay him with cursing and railing;
SIR.29.6	And for honour he will pay him disgrace.
SIR.29.7	They have feared to be defrauded for nothing.
SIR.29.8	However with a man in poor estate be patient;
SIR.29.8	And let him not wait for 
SIR.29.9	Help a poor man for the commandment’s sake;
SIR.29.9	And according to his need send him not empty away.
SIR.29.10	Lose 
SIR.29.10	And let it not rust under the stone to be lost.
SIR.29.11	Bestow your treasure according to the commandments of the Most High;
SIR.29.11	And it shall profit you more than gold.
SIR.29.12	Shut up alms in your store-chambers;
SIR.29.12	And it shall deliver you out of all affliction:
SIR.29.13	It shall fight for you against your enemy
SIR.29.13	Better than a mighty shield and a ponderous spear.
SIR.29.14	A good man will be surety for his neighbour;
SIR.29.14	And he that has lost shame will fail him.
SIR.29.15	Forget not the good offices of your surety;
SIR.29.15	For he has given his life for you.
SIR.29.16	A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety;
SIR.29.17	And he that is of an unthankful mind will fail him that delivered him.
SIR.29.18	Suretiship has undone many that were prospering,
SIR.29.18	And shaken them as a wave of the sea:
SIR.29.18	Mighty men has it driven from their homes;
SIR.29.18	And they wandered amongst strange nations.
SIR.29.19	A sinner that falls into suretiship,
SIR.29.19	And undertakes contracts for work, shall fall into lawsuits.
SIR.29.20	Help your neighbour according to your power,
SIR.29.20	And take heed to yourself that you fall not 
SIR.29.21	The chief thing for life is water, and bread,
SIR.29.21	And a garment, and a house to cover shame.
SIR.29.22	Better is the life of a poor man under a shelter of logs,
SIR.29.22	Than sumptuous fare in another man’s house.
SIR.29.23	With little or with much, be well satisfied.
SIR.29.24	It is a miserable life to go from house to house:
SIR.29.24	And where you are a sojourner, you shall not 
SIR.29.25	You shall entertain, and give to drink, and have no thanks:
SIR.29.25	And in addition to this you shall hear bitter words.
SIR.29.26	Come here, you sojourner, furnish a table,
SIR.29.26	And if you have anything in your hand, feed me with it.
SIR.29.27	Go forth, you sojourner, from the face of honour;
SIR.29.27	My brother is come to be my guest; I have need of my house.
SIR.29.28	These things are grievous to a man of understanding;
SIR.29.28	The upbraiding of house-room, and the reproaching of the money-lender.
SIR.30.1	He that loves his son will continue to lay stripes upon him,
SIR.30.1	That he may have joy of him in the end.
SIR.30.2	He that chastises his son shall have profit of him,
SIR.30.2	And shall glory of him amongst his acquaintance.
SIR.30.3	He that teaches his son shall provoke his enemy to jealousy;
SIR.30.3	And before friends he shall rejoice of him.
SIR.30.4	His father dies, and is as though he had not died;
SIR.30.4	For he has left one behind him like himself.
SIR.30.5	In his life, he saw and rejoiced 
SIR.30.5	And when he died, he sorrowed not:
SIR.30.6	He left behind him an avenger against his enemies,
SIR.30.6	And one to requite kindness to his friends.
SIR.30.7	He that makes too much of his son shall bind up his wounds;
SIR.30.7	And his heart will be troubled at every cry.
SIR.30.8	An unbroken horse becomes stubborn;
SIR.30.8	And a son left at large becomes headstrong.
SIR.30.9	Cocker your child, and he shall make you afraid:
SIR.30.9	Play with him, and he will grieve you.
SIR.30.10	Laugh not with him, lest you have sorrow with him;
SIR.30.10	And you shall gnash your teeth in the end.
SIR.30.11	Give him no liberty in his youth,
SIR.30.12	And beat him on the sides while he is a child,
SIR.30.12	Lest he wax stubborn, and be disobedient to you;
SIR.30.13	Chastise your son, and take pains with him,
SIR.30.13	Lest his shameless behaviour be an offence to you.
SIR.30.14	Better is a poor man, being sound and strong of constitution,
SIR.30.14	Than a rich man that is plagued in his body.
SIR.30.15	Health and a good constitution are better than all gold;
SIR.30.15	And a strong body than wealth without measure.
SIR.30.16	There is no riches better than health of body;
SIR.30.16	And there is no gladness above the joy of the heart.
SIR.30.17	Death is better than a bitter life,
SIR.30.18	Good things poured out upon a mouth that is closed
SIR.30.18	Are 
SIR.30.19	What does an offering profit an idol?
SIR.30.19	For neither shall it eat nor smell:
SIR.30.19	So is he that is afflicted of the Lord,
SIR.30.20	Seeing with his eyes and groaning,
SIR.30.20	As an eunuch embracing a virgin and groaning.
SIR.30.21	Give not over your soul to sorrow;
SIR.30.21	And afflict not yourself in your own counsel.
SIR.30.22	Gladness of heart is the life of a man;
SIR.30.22	And the joyfulness of a man is length of days.
SIR.30.23	Love your own soul, and comfort your heart:
SIR.30.23	And remove sorrow far from you;
SIR.30.23	For sorrow has destroyed many,
SIR.30.23	And there is no profit therein.
SIR.30.24	Envy and wrath shorten 
SIR.30.24	And care brings old age before the time.
SIR.30.25	A cheerful and good heart
SIR.30.25	Will have a care of his meat and diet.
SIR.31.1	Wakefulness that comes of riches consumes the flesh,
SIR.31.1	And the anxiety thereof puts away sleep.
SIR.31.2	Wakeful anxiety will crave slumber;
SIR.31.2	And
SIR.31.3	A rich man toils in gathering money together;
SIR.31.3	And when he rests, he is filled with his good things.
SIR.31.4	A poor man toils in lack of substance;
SIR.31.4	And when he rests, he becomes needy.
SIR.31.5	He that loves gold shall not be justified;
SIR.31.5	And he that follows destruction shall himself have his fill 
SIR.31.6	Many have been given over to ruin for the sake of gold;
SIR.31.6	And their perdition
SIR.31.7	It is a stumbling block to those who sacrifice to it;
SIR.31.7	And every fool shall be taken therewith.
SIR.31.8	Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish,
SIR.31.8	And that goes not after gold.
SIR.31.9	Who is he? and we will call him blessed:
SIR.31.9	For wonderful things has he done amongst his people.
SIR.31.10	Who has been tried by it, and found perfect?
SIR.31.10	Then let him glory.
SIR.31.10	Who has had the power to transgress, and has not transgressed?
SIR.31.10	And to do evil, and has not done it?
SIR.31.11	His goods shall be made sure,
SIR.31.11	And the congregation shall declare his alms.
SIR.31.12	Sittest you at a great table?
SIR.31.12	And say not, Many are the things upon it.
SIR.31.13	Remember that an evil eye is a wicked thing:
SIR.31.13	What has been created more evil than an eye?
SIR.31.13	Therefore it sheds tears from every face.
SIR.31.14	Stretch not your hand wherever it looks,
SIR.31.14	And thrust not yourself with it into the dish.
SIR.31.15	Consider your neighbour’s 
SIR.31.15	And be discreet in every point.
SIR.31.16	Eat, as 
SIR.31.16	And eat not greedily, lest you be hated.
SIR.31.17	Be first to leave off for manners’ sake;
SIR.31.17	And be not insatiable, lest you offend.
SIR.31.18	And if you sit amongst many,
SIR.31.18	Reach not out your hand before them.
SIR.31.19	How sufficient to a well-mannered man is a very little,
SIR.31.19	And he does not breathe hard upon his bed.
SIR.31.20	Healthy sleep comes of moderate eating;
SIR.31.20	He rises early, and his wits are with him:
SIR.31.20	The pain of wakefulness, and colic,
SIR.31.20	And griping, are with an insatiable man.
SIR.31.21	And if you have been forced to eat,
SIR.31.21	Rise up in the midst thereof, and you shall have rest.
SIR.31.22	Hear me, my son, and despise me not,
SIR.31.22	And at the last you shall find my words 
SIR.31.22	In all your works be quick,
SIR.31.22	And no disease shall come to you.
SIR.31.23	Him that is liberal of his meat the lips shall bless;
SIR.31.23	And the testimony of his excellence shall be believed.
SIR.31.24	The city will murmer at he who is a stingy with his meat;
SIR.31.24	And the testimony of his stinginess will be sure.
SIR.31.25	Show not yourself valiant in wine;
SIR.31.25	For wine has destroyed many.
SIR.31.26	The furnace proves the temper 
SIR.31.26	So does wine 
SIR.31.27	Wine is as good as life to men,
SIR.31.27	If you drink it in its measure:
SIR.31.27	What life is there to a man that is without wine?
SIR.31.27	And it has been created to make men glad.
SIR.31.28	Wine drunk in season 
SIR.31.28	Is joy of heart, and gladness of soul:
SIR.31.29	Wine drunk largely is bitterness of soul,
SIR.31.29	With provocation and conflict.
SIR.31.30	Drunkenness increases the rage of a fool to his hurt;
SIR.31.30	It diminishes strength, and adds wounds.
SIR.31.31	Rebuke not your neighbour at a banquet of wine,
SIR.31.31	Neither set him at nothing in his mirth:
SIR.31.31	Speak not to him a word of reproach,
SIR.31.31	And press not upon him by asking back 
SIR.32.1	Have they made you ruler 
SIR.32.1	Be not lifted up,
SIR.32.1	Be you amongst them as one of them;
SIR.32.1	Take thought for them, and so sit down.
SIR.32.2	And when you have done all your office, take your place,
SIR.32.2	That you may be gladdened on their account,
SIR.32.2	And receive a crown for your well ordering.
SIR.32.3	Speak, you that are the elder, for it becomes you, 
SIR.32.3	And hinder not music.
SIR.32.4	Pour not out talk where there is a performance of music,
SIR.32.4	And display not your wisdom out of season.
SIR.32.7	Speak, young man, if there be need of you;
SIR.32.8	Sum up your speech, many things in few words;
SIR.32.8	Be as one that knows and yet holds his tongue.
SIR.32.9	And when another is speaking, make not much babbling.
SIR.32.10	Lightning speeds before thunder;
SIR.32.10	And before a shamefast man favour shall go forth.
SIR.32.11	Rise up betimes, and be not the last;
SIR.32.11	Get you home quickly and loiter not:
SIR.32.12	There take your pastime, and do what is in your heart;
SIR.32.12	And sin not by proud speech:
SIR.32.13	And for these things bless him that made you,
SIR.32.13	And gives you to drink freely of his good things.
SIR.32.14	He that fears the Lord will receive 
SIR.32.14	And those who seek 
SIR.32.15	He that seeks the law shall be filled therewith:
SIR.32.15	But the hypocrite shall stumble thereat.
SIR.32.16	They that fear the Lord shall find judgement,
SIR.32.16	And shall kindle righteous acts as a light.
SIR.32.17	A sinful man shuns reproof,
SIR.32.17	And will find a judgement according to his will.
SIR.32.18	A man of counsel will not neglect a thought;
SIR.32.18	A strange and proud man will not crouch in fear,
SIR.32.18	Even after he has done a thing by himself without counsel.
SIR.32.19	Do nothing without counsel;
SIR.32.19	And when you have once done, repent not.
SIR.32.20	Go not in a way of conflict;
SIR.32.20	And stumble not in stony places.
SIR.32.21	Be not confident in a
SIR.32.22	And beware of your own children.
SIR.32.23	In every work trust your own soul;
SIR.32.23	For this is the keeping of the commandments.
SIR.32.24	He that believes the law gives heed to the commandment;
SIR.32.24	And he that trusts in the Lord shall suffer no loss.
SIR.33.1	There shall no evil happen to him that fears the Lord;
SIR.33.1	But in temptation once and again he will deliver him.
SIR.33.2	A wise man will not hate the law;
SIR.33.2	But he that is a hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm.
SIR.33.3	A man of understanding will put his trust in the law;
SIR.33.3	And the law is faithful to him, as when one asks at the oracle.
SIR.33.4	Prepare 
SIR.33.4	Bind up instruction, and make your answer.
SIR.33.5	The heart of a fool is 
SIR.33.5	And his thoughts like a rolling axle tree.
SIR.33.6	A stallion horse is as a mocking friend;
SIR.33.6	He neighs under every one that sits upon him.
SIR.33.7	Why does one day excel another,
SIR.33.7	When all the light of every day in the year is of the sun?
SIR.33.8	By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished;
SIR.33.8	And he varied seasons and feasts:
SIR.33.9	Some of them he exalted and hallowed,
SIR.33.9	And some of them has he made ordinary days.
SIR.33.10	And all men are from the ground,
SIR.33.10	And Adam was created of earth.
SIR.33.11	In the abundance of his knowledge the Lord distinguished them,
SIR.33.11	And made their ways various:
SIR.33.12	Some of them he blessed and exalted,
SIR.33.12	And some of them he hallowed and brought near to himself:
SIR.33.12	Some of them he cursed and brought low,
SIR.33.12	And overthrew them from their place.
SIR.33.13	As the clay of the potter in his hand,
SIR.33.13	All his ways are according to his good pleasure;
SIR.33.13	So men are in the hand of him that made them,
SIR.33.13	To render to them according to his judgement.
SIR.33.14	Good is the opposite of evil,
SIR.33.14	And life is the opposite of death:
SIR.33.14	So
SIR.33.15	And thus look upon all the works of the Most High;
SIR.33.15	Two and two, one against another.
SIR.33.16	And I waked up last,
SIR.33.16	As one that gleans after the grape gatherers:
SIR.33.16	By the blessing of the Lord I got before them,
SIR.33.16	And filled my winepress as one that gathers grapes.
SIR.33.17	Consider that I laboured not for myself alone,
SIR.33.17	But for all those who seek instruction.
SIR.33.18	Hear me, you° great men of the people,
SIR.33.18	And listen with your ears, you° rulers of the congregation.
SIR.33.19	To son and wife, to brother and friend,
SIR.33.19	Give not power over you while you live;
SIR.33.19	And give not your goods to another,
SIR.33.19	Lest you repent and make supplication for them 
SIR.33.20	Whilst you yet live, and breath is in you,
SIR.33.20	Give not yourself over to anybody.
SIR.33.21	For better it is that your children should supplicate you,
SIR.33.21	Than that you should look to the hand of your sons.
SIR.33.22	In all your works keep the upper hand;
SIR.33.22	Bring not a stain on your honour.
SIR.33.23	In the day that you end the days of your life,
SIR.33.23	And in the time of death, distribute your inheritance.
SIR.33.24	Fodder, a stick, and burdens, for an ass;
SIR.33.24	Bread, and discipline, and work, for a servant.
SIR.33.25	Set your servant to work, and you shall find rest:
SIR.33.25	Leave his hands idle, and he will seek liberty.
SIR.33.26	Yoke and thong will bow the neck:
SIR.33.26	And for an evil servant there are racks and tortures.
SIR.33.27	Send him to labour, that he be not idle;
SIR.33.27	For idleness teaches much mischief.
SIR.33.28	Set him to work, as is fit for him;
SIR.33.28	And if he obey not, make his fetters heavy.
SIR.33.29	And be not excessive towards any;
SIR.33.29	And without judgement do nothing.
SIR.33.30	If you have a servant, let him be as yourself,
SIR.33.30	Because you have bought him with blood.
SIR.33.31	If you have a servant, treat him as yourself;
SIR.33.31	If you treat him ill, and he depart and run away,
SIR.33.31	Which way will you go to seek him?
SIR.34.1	Vain and false hopes are for a man void of understanding;
SIR.34.1	And dreams give wings to fools.
SIR.34.2	As one that catches at a shadow, and follows after the wind,
SIR.34.2	So is he that sets his mind on dreams.
SIR.34.3	The vision of dreams is 
SIR.34.3	The likeness of a face near a face.
SIR.34.4	Of an unclean thing what shall be cleansed?
SIR.34.4	And of that which is false what shall be true?
SIR.34.5	Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain:
SIR.34.5	And the heart fancies, as a woman’s in travail.
SIR.34.6	If they be not sent from the Most High in 
SIR.34.6	Give not your heart to them.
SIR.34.7	For dreams have led many astray:
SIR.34.7	And they have failed by putting their hope in them.
SIR.34.8	Without lying shall the law be accomplished;
SIR.34.8	And wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth.
SIR.34.9	A well-instructed man knows many things;
SIR.34.9	And he that has much experience will declare understanding.
SIR.34.10	He that has no experience knows few things:
SIR.34.10	But he that has wandered shall increase 
SIR.34.11	In my wandering I have seen many things;
SIR.34.11	And more than my words is my understanding.
SIR.34.12	Ofttimes was I in danger even to death;
SIR.34.12	And I was preserved because of these things.
SIR.34.13	The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live;
SIR.34.13	For their hope is upon him that saves them.
SIR.34.14	Whoso fears the Lord shall not be afraid, and shall not play the coward;
SIR.34.14	For he is his hope.
SIR.34.15	Blessed is the soul of him that fears the Lord:
SIR.34.15	To whom does he give heed? and who is his stay?
SIR.34.16	The eyes of the Lord are upon those who love him,
SIR.34.16	A mighty protection and strong stay,
SIR.34.16	A cover from the hot blast, and a cover from the noonday,
SIR.34.16	A guard from stumbling, and a help from falling.
SIR.34.17	He raises up the soul, and enlightens the eyes:
SIR.34.17	He gives healing, life, and blessing.
SIR.34.18	He that sacrifices of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is made in mockery;
SIR.34.18	And the mockeries of wicked men are not well-pleasing.
SIR.34.19	The Most High has no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly;
SIR.34.19	Neither is he pacified for sins by the multitude of sacrifices.
SIR.34.20	Is he that brings a sacrifice from the goods of the poor.
SIR.34.21	The bread of the needy is the life of the poor:
SIR.34.21	He that deprives him thereof is a man of blood.
SIR.34.22	And 
SIR.34.23	One building, and another pulling down,
SIR.34.23	What profit have they had but toil?
SIR.34.24	One praying, and another cursing,
SIR.34.24	Whose voice will the Lord listen to?
SIR.34.25	He that washes himself after 
SIR.34.25	What profit has he in his washing?
SIR.34.26	Even so a man fasting for his sins,
SIR.34.26	And going again, and doing the same;
SIR.34.26	Who will listen to his prayer?
SIR.34.26	And what profit has he in his humiliation?
SIR.35.1	He that keeps the law multiplies offerings;
SIR.35.1	He that takes heed to the commandments sacrifices a peace offering.
SIR.35.2	He that requites a good turn offers fine flour;
SIR.35.2	And he that gives alms sacrifices a thank offering.
SIR.35.3	To depart from wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord;
SIR.35.3	And to depart from unrighteousness is an atoning sacrifice.
SIR.35.4	See that you appear not in the presence of the Lord empty.
SIR.35.5	For all these things 
SIR.35.6	The offering of the righteous makes the altar fat;
SIR.35.6	And the sweet savour thereof 
SIR.35.7	The sacrifice of a righteous man is acceptable;
SIR.35.7	And the memorial thereof shall not be forgotten.
SIR.35.8	Glorify the Lord with a good eye,
SIR.35.8	And stint not the first fruits of your hands.
SIR.35.9	In every gift show a cheerful countenance,
SIR.35.9	And dedicate your tithe with gladness.
SIR.35.10	Give to the Most High according as he has given;
SIR.35.10	And as your hand has found, 
SIR.35.11	For the Lord recompenses,
SIR.35.11	And he will recompense you sevenfold.
SIR.35.12	Think not to corrupt with gifts; for he will not receive them:
SIR.35.12	And set not your mind on an unrighteous sacrifice;
SIR.35.12	For the Lord is judge,
SIR.35.12	And with him is no respect of persons.
SIR.35.13	He will not accept any person against a poor man;
SIR.35.13	And he will listen to the prayer of him that is wronged.
SIR.35.14	He will in no wise despise the supplication of the fatherless;
SIR.35.14	Nor the widow,
SIR.35.15	Do not the tears of the widow run down her cheek?
SIR.35.15	And is not her cry against him that has caused them to fall?
SIR.35.16	He that serves 
SIR.35.16	And his supplication shall reach to the clouds.
SIR.35.17	The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds;
SIR.35.17	And till it come near, he will not be comforted;
SIR.35.17	And he will not depart, till the Most High shall visit;
SIR.35.17	And he shall judge
SIR.35.18	And the Lord will not be slack, neither will he be patient towards them,
SIR.35.18	Till he have crushed the loins of the unmerciful;
SIR.35.18	And he shall repay vengeance to the heathen;
SIR.35.18	Till he have taken away the multitude of the arrogant,
SIR.35.18	And broken in pieces the sceptres of the unrighteous;
SIR.35.19	Till he have rendered to 
SIR.35.19	And 
SIR.35.19	Till he have judged the cause of his people;
SIR.35.19	And he shall make them to rejoice in his mercy.
SIR.35.20	Mercy is seasonable in the time of his afflicting 
SIR.35.20	As clouds of rain in the time of drought.
SIR.36.1	Have mercy upon us, O Lord the God of all, and behold;
SIR.36.2	And send your fear upon all the nations:
SIR.36.3	Lift up your hand against the strange nations;
SIR.36.3	And let them see your mighty power.
SIR.36.4	As you were sanctified in us before them,
SIR.36.4	So be you magnified in them before us.
SIR.36.5	And let them know you, as we also have known you,
SIR.36.5	That there is no God but only you, O God.
SIR.36.6	Show new signs, and work various wonders;
SIR.36.6	Glorify your hand and your right arm.
SIR.36.7	Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath;
SIR.36.7	Take away the adversary, and destroy the enemy.
SIR.36.8	Hasten the time, and remember the oath;
SIR.36.8	And let them declare your mighty works.
SIR.36.9	Let him that escapes be devoured by the rage of fire;
SIR.36.9	And may those who harm your people find destruction.
SIR.36.10	Crush the heads of the rulers of the enemies,
SIR.36.10	That say, There is none but we.
SIR.36.11	Gather all the tribes of Jacob together,
SIR.36.11	And
SIR.36.12	O Lord, have mercy upon the people that is called by your name,
SIR.36.12	And upon Israel, whom you did liken to a firstborn.
SIR.36.13	Have compassion upon the city of your sanctuary,
SIR.36.13	Jerusalem, the place of your rest.
SIR.36.14	Fill Sion; exalt your oracles,
SIR.36.14	And 
SIR.36.15	Give testimony to those that were your creatures in the beginning,
SIR.36.15	And raise up the prophecies that have been in your name.
SIR.36.16	Give reward to those who wait for you:
SIR.36.16	And men shall put their trust in your prophets.
SIR.36.17	Listen, O Lord, to the prayer of your suppliants,
SIR.36.17	According to the blessing of Aaron concerning your people;
SIR.36.17	And all those who are on the earth shall know
SIR.36.17	That you are the Lord, the
SIR.36.18	The belly will eat any meat;
SIR.36.18	Yet is one meat better than another.
SIR.36.19	The
SIR.36.19	So does an understanding heart false speeches.
SIR.36.20	A contrary heart will cause heaviness:
SIR.36.20	And a man of experience will recompense him.
SIR.36.21	A woman will receive any man;
SIR.36.21	But one daughter is better than another.
SIR.36.22	The beauty of a woman cheers the countenance;
SIR.36.22	And a man desires nothing so much.
SIR.36.23	If there is on her tongue mercy and meekness,
SIR.36.23	Her husband is not like the sons of men.
SIR.36.24	He that gets a wife enters upon a possession:
SIR.36.24	A help meet for him, and a pillar of rest.
SIR.36.25	Where no hedge is, the possession will be laid waste:
SIR.36.25	And he that has no wife will mourn as he wanders up and down.
SIR.36.26	For who will trust a nimble robber, that skips from city to city?
SIR.36.26	Even so 
SIR.37.1	Every friend will say, I also am his friend:
SIR.37.1	But there is a friend, which is only a friend in name.
SIR.37.2	Is there not a grief in it even to death,
SIR.37.2	When a companion and friend is turned to enmity?
SIR.37.3	O wicked imagination, whence came you rolling in
SIR.37.3	To cover the dry land with deceitfulness?
SIR.37.4	There is a companion, which rejoices in the gladness of a friend,
SIR.37.4	But in time of affliction will be against him.
SIR.37.5	There is a companion, which for the belly’s sake labours with his friend,
SIR.37.5	In the face of battle will take up the buckler.
SIR.37.6	Forget not a friend in your soul;
SIR.37.6	And be not unmindful of him in your riches.
SIR.37.7	Every counsellor extols counsel;
SIR.37.7	But there is that counsels for himself.
SIR.37.8	Let your soul beware of a counsellor,
SIR.37.8	And know you before what is his interest
SIR.37.8	(For he will take counsel for himself);
SIR.37.8	Lest he cast the lot upon you,
SIR.37.9	And say to you, Your way is good:
SIR.37.9	And he will stand near you, to see what will happen to you.
SIR.37.10	Take not counsel with one that looks askance at you;
SIR.37.10	And hide your counsel from such as are jealous of you.
SIR.37.11	Neither with a coward about war;
SIR.37.11	Nor with a merchant about exchange;
SIR.37.11	Nor with a buyer about selling;
SIR.37.11	Nor with an envious man about thankfulness;
SIR.37.11	Nor with an unmerciful man about kindliness;
SIR.37.11	Nor with a sluggard about any kind of work;
SIR.37.11	Nor with a hireling in your house about finishing 
SIR.37.11	Nor with an idle servant about much business:
SIR.37.11	Give not heed to these in any matter of counsel.
SIR.37.12	But rather be continually with a godly man,
SIR.37.12	Whom you shall have known to be a keeper of the commandments,
SIR.37.12	Who in his soul is as your own soul,
SIR.37.12	And who will grieve with you, if you shall miscarry.
SIR.37.13	And make the counsel of your heart to stand;
SIR.37.13	For there is none more faithful to you than it.
SIR.37.14	For a man’s soul is sometimes wont to bring him tidings,
SIR.37.14	More than seven watchmen that sit on high on a watch-tower.
SIR.37.15	And above all this entreat the Most High,
SIR.37.15	That he may direct your way in truth.
SIR.37.16	Let reason be the beginning of every work,
SIR.37.16	And let counsel go before every action.
SIR.37.17	As a token of the changing of the heart,
SIR.37.18	four manner of things do rise up,
SIR.37.18	Good and evil, life and death;
SIR.37.18	And that which rules over them continually is the tongue.
SIR.37.19	There is one that is shrewd 
SIR.37.19	And yet is unprofitable to his own soul.
SIR.37.20	There is 
SIR.37.20	He shall be destitute of all food:
SIR.37.21	For grace was not given him from the Lord;
SIR.37.21	Because he is deprived of all wisdom.
SIR.37.22	There is one that is wise to his own soul;
SIR.37.22	And the fruits of his understanding are trustworthy in the mouth.
SIR.37.23	A wise man will instruct his own people;
SIR.37.23	And the fruits of his understanding are trustworthy.
SIR.37.24	A wise man shall be filled with blessing;
SIR.37.24	And all those who see him shall call him happy.
SIR.37.25	The life of man is counted by days;
SIR.37.25	And the days of Israel are innumerable.
SIR.37.26	The wise man shall inherit confidence amongst his people,
SIR.37.26	And his name shall live forever.
SIR.37.27	My son, prove your soul in your life,
SIR.37.27	And see what is evil for it, and give not that to it.
SIR.37.28	For all things are not profitable for all men,
SIR.37.28	Neither has every soul pleasure in every thing.
SIR.37.29	Don’t be insatiable in any luxury,
SIR.37.29	And don’t be greedy in the things that you eat.
SIR.37.30	For in multitude of meats there shall be disease,
SIR.37.30	And surfeiting shall come near to colic.
SIR.37.31	Because of surfeiting have many perished;
SIR.37.31	But he that takes heed shall prolong his life.
SIR.38.1	Honour a physician according to your need 
SIR.38.1	For truly the Lord has created him.
SIR.38.2	For from the Most High comes healing;
SIR.38.2	And from the king he shall receive a gift.
SIR.38.3	The skill of the physician shall lift up his head;
SIR.38.3	And in the sight of great men he shall be admired.
SIR.38.4	The Lord created medicines out of the earth;
SIR.38.4	And a prudent man will have no disgust at them.
SIR.38.5	Was not water made sweet with wood,
SIR.38.5	That the virtue thereof might be known?
SIR.38.6	And he gave men skill,
SIR.38.6	That
SIR.38.7	With them does he heal 
SIR.38.7	And takes away his pain.
SIR.38.8	With these will the apothecary make a confection;
SIR.38.8	And his works shall not be brought to an end;
SIR.38.8	And from him is peace upon the face of the earth.
SIR.38.9	My son, in your sickness be not negligent;
SIR.38.9	But pray to the Lord, and he shall heal you.
SIR.38.10	Put away wrong doing, and order your hands aright,
SIR.38.10	And cleanse your heart from all manner of sin.
SIR.38.11	Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour;
SIR.38.11	And make fat your offering, as one that is not.
SIR.38.12	Then give place to the physician, for truly the Lord has created him;
SIR.38.12	And let him not go from you, for you have need of him.
SIR.38.13	There is a time when in their very hands is the issue for good.
SIR.38.14	For they also shall beseech the Lord,
SIR.38.14	That he may prosper them in 
SIR.38.15	He that sins before his Maker,
SIR.38.15	Let him fall into the hands of the physician.
SIR.38.16	My son, let your tears fall over the dead,
SIR.38.16	And as one that suffers grievously begin lamentation;
SIR.38.16	And wind up his body according to his due,
SIR.38.16	And neglect not his burial.
SIR.38.17	Make bitter weeping, and make passionate wailing,
SIR.38.17	And let your mourning be according to his merit,
SIR.38.17	For one day or two, lest you be spoken evil of:
SIR.38.17	And so be comforted for your sorrow.
SIR.38.18	For of sorrow comes death,
SIR.38.18	And sorrow of heart will bow down the strength.
SIR.38.19	In calamity sorrow also remains:
SIR.38.19	And the poor man’s life is
SIR.38.20	Don’t give your heart to sorrow.
SIR.38.20	Put it away, remembering the last end.
SIR.38.21	Don’t forget it, for there is no returning again:
SIR.38.21	Him you shall not profit, and you will hurt yourself.
SIR.38.22	Remember the sentence upon him; for so also shall yours be;
SIR.38.22	Yesterday for me, and today for you.
SIR.38.23	When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest;
SIR.38.23	And be comforted for him, when his spirit departs from him.
SIR.38.24	The wisdom of the scribe comes by opportunity of leisure;
SIR.38.24	And
SIR.38.25	How shall he become wise that holds the plough,
SIR.38.25	That glories in the shaft of the goad,
SIR.38.25	That drives oxen, and is occupied in their labours,
SIR.38.25	And whose discourse is of the stock of bulls?
SIR.38.26	He will set his heart upon turning his furrows;
SIR.38.26	And his wakefulness is to give his heifers their fodder.
SIR.38.27	So is every craftsman and workmaster,
SIR.38.27	That passes his time by night as by day;
SIR.38.27	They that cut gravings of signets,
SIR.38.27	And his diligence is to make great variety;
SIR.38.27	He will set his heart to preserve likeness in his portraiture,
SIR.38.27	And will be wakeful to finish his work.
SIR.38.28	So is the smith sitting by the anvil,
SIR.38.28	And considering the unwrought iron:
SIR.38.28	The vapour of the fire will waste his flesh;
SIR.38.28	And in the heat of the furnace he will wrestle 
SIR.38.28	The noise of the hammer will
SIR.38.28	And his eyes are upon the pattern of the vessel;
SIR.38.28	He will set his heart upon perfecting his works,
SIR.38.28	And he will be wakeful to adorn them perfectly.
SIR.38.29	So is the potter sitting at his work,
SIR.38.29	And turning the wheel about with his feet,
SIR.38.29	Who is always anxiously set at his work,
SIR.38.29	And all his handiwork is by number;
SIR.38.30	He will fashion the clay with his arm,
SIR.38.30	And will bend its strength in front of his feet;
SIR.38.30	He will apply his heart to finish the glazing;
SIR.38.30	And he will be wakeful to make clean the furnace.
SIR.38.31	All these put their trust in their hands;
SIR.38.31	And each becomes wise in his own work.
SIR.38.32	Without these shall not a city be inhabited,
SIR.38.32	And men shall not sojourn nor walk up and down 
SIR.38.33	And in the assembly they shall not mount on high;
SIR.38.33	They shall not sit on the seat of the judge,
SIR.38.33	And they shall not understand the covenant of judgement:
SIR.38.33	Neither shall they declare instruction and judgement;
SIR.38.33	And where parables are they shall not be found.
SIR.38.34	But they will maintain the fabric of the
SIR.38.34	And in the handiwork of their craft is their prayer.
SIR.39.1	And meditates in the law of the Most High;
SIR.39.1	He will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients,
SIR.39.1	And will be occupied in prophecies.
SIR.39.2	He will keep the discourse of the men of renown,
SIR.39.2	And will enter in amidst the subtleties of parables.
SIR.39.3	He will seek out the hidden meaning of proverbs,
SIR.39.3	And be conversant in the dark sayings of parables.
SIR.39.4	He will serve amongst great men,
SIR.39.4	And appear before him that rules:
SIR.39.4	He will travel through the land of strange nations;
SIR.39.4	For he has tried good things and evil amongst men.
SIR.39.5	He will apply his heart to return early to the Lord that made him,
SIR.39.5	And will make supplication before the Most High,
SIR.39.5	And will open his mouth in prayer,
SIR.39.5	And will make supplication for his sins.
SIR.39.6	If the great Lord will,
SIR.39.6	He shall be filled with the spirit of understanding:
SIR.39.6	He shall pour forth the words of his wisdom,
SIR.39.6	And in prayer give thanks to the Lord.
SIR.39.7	He shall direct his counsel and knowledge,
SIR.39.7	And in his secrets shall he meditate.
SIR.39.8	He shall show forth the instruction which he has been taught,
SIR.39.8	And shall glory in the law of the covenant of the Lord.
SIR.39.9	Many shall commend his understanding;
SIR.39.9	And so long as the world endures, it shall not be blotted out:
SIR.39.9	His memorial shall not depart,
SIR.39.9	And his name shall live from generation to generation.
SIR.39.10	Nations shall declare his wisdom,
SIR.39.10	And the congregation shall tell out his praise.
SIR.39.11	If he continue, he shall leave a greater name than a thousand:
SIR.39.11	And if he
SIR.39.12	Yet more I will utter, which I have thought upon;
SIR.39.12	And I am filled as the moon at the full.
SIR.39.13	Listen to me, you° holy children,
SIR.39.13	And bud forth as a rose growing by a brook of water:
SIR.39.14	And give you° a sweet savour as frankincense,
SIR.39.14	And put forth flowers as a lily,
SIR.39.14	Spread abroad a sweet smell, and sing a song of praise;
SIR.39.14	Bless you° the Lord for all his works.
SIR.39.15	Magnify his name,
SIR.39.15	And give utterance to his praise
SIR.39.15	With the songs of your lips, and with harps;
SIR.39.15	And thus shall you° say when you° utter 
SIR.39.16	All the works of the Lord are exceedingly good,
SIR.39.16	And every command shall be 
SIR.39.17	None can say, What is this? wherefore is that?
SIR.39.17	For in his season they shall all be sought out.
SIR.39.17	At his word the waters stood as a heap,
SIR.39.17	And the receptacles of waters at the word of his mouth.
SIR.39.18	At his command is all his good pleasure 
SIR.39.18	And there is none that shall hinder his salvation.
SIR.39.19	The works of all flesh are before him;
SIR.39.19	And it is not possible to be hid from his eyes.
SIR.39.20	He sees from everlasting to everlasting;
SIR.39.20	And there is nothing wonderful before him.
SIR.39.21	None can say, What is this? wherefore is that?
SIR.39.21	For all things are created for their uses.
SIR.39.22	His blessing covered the dry land as a river,
SIR.39.22	And saturated it as a flood.
SIR.39.23	As he has made the waters salty;
SIR.39.23	So shall the heathen inherit his wrath.
SIR.39.24	His ways are plain to the holy;
SIR.39.24	So are they stumbling blocks to the wicked.
SIR.39.25	Good things are created from the beginning for the good;
SIR.39.25	So are evil things for sinners.
SIR.39.26	The chief of all things necessary for the life of man
SIR.39.26	Are water, and fire, and iron, and salt,
SIR.39.26	And flour of wheat, and honey, and milk,
SIR.39.26	The blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing.
SIR.39.27	All these things are for good to the godly;
SIR.39.27	So to the sinners they shall be turned into evil.
SIR.39.28	There be winds that are created for vengeance,
SIR.39.28	And in their fury lay on their scourges heavily;
SIR.39.28	In the time of consummation they pour out their strength,
SIR.39.28	And shall appease the wrath of him that made them.
SIR.39.29	Fire, and hail, and famine, and death,
SIR.39.29	All these are created for vengeance;
SIR.39.30	Teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions and adders,
SIR.39.30	And a sword punishing the ungodly to destruction.
SIR.39.31	They shall rejoice in his commandment,
SIR.39.31	And shall be made ready upon earth, when need is;
SIR.39.31	And in their seasons they shall not transgress 
SIR.39.32	Therefore from the beginning I was resolved,
SIR.39.32	And I thought 
SIR.39.33	All the works of the Lord are good:
SIR.39.33	And he will supply every need in its season.
SIR.39.34	And none can say, This is worse than that:
SIR.39.34	For they shall all be well approved in their season.
SIR.39.35	And now with all your heart and mouth sing you° praises,
SIR.39.35	And bless the name of the Lord.
SIR.40.1	Great travail is created for every man,
SIR.40.1	And a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam,
SIR.40.1	From the day of their coming forth from their mother’s womb,
SIR.40.1	Until the day for their burial in the mother of all things.
SIR.40.2	The expectation of things to come, and the day of death,
SIR.40.3	From him that sits on a throne of glory,
SIR.40.3	Even to him that is humbled in earth and ashes;
SIR.40.4	From him that wears purple and a crown,
SIR.40.4	Even to him that is clothed with a hempen frock.
SIR.40.5	And fear of death, and anger, and strife;
SIR.40.5	And in the time of rest upon his bed
SIR.40.5	His night sleep does change his knowledge.
SIR.40.6	A little or nothing is his resting,
SIR.40.6	And afterward in his sleep, as in a day of keeping watch,
SIR.40.6	He is troubled in the vision of his heart,
SIR.40.6	As one that has escaped from the front of battle.
SIR.40.7	In the very time of his deliverance he awakens,
SIR.40.7	And marvels that the fear is nothing.
SIR.40.8	And upon sinners sevenfold more.
SIR.40.9	Death, and bloodshed, and strife, and sword,
SIR.40.9	Calamities, famine, suffering, and the scourge;
SIR.40.10	All these things were created for the wicked,
SIR.40.10	And because of them came the flood.
SIR.40.11	All things that are of the earth turn to the earth again:
SIR.40.11	And 
SIR.40.12	All bribery and injustice shall be blotted out;
SIR.40.12	And good faith shall stand forever.
SIR.40.13	The goods of the unjust shall be dried up like a river,
SIR.40.13	And like a great thunder in rain shall go off in noise.
SIR.40.14	In opening his hands 
SIR.40.14	So shall transgressors utterly fail.
SIR.40.15	The children of the ungodly shall not put forth many branches;
SIR.40.15	And 
SIR.40.16	The sedge 
SIR.40.16	Shall be plucked up before all grass.
SIR.40.17	Bounty is as a garden
SIR.40.17	And almsgiving endures forever.
SIR.40.18	The life of one that labours, and is content, shall be made sweet;
SIR.40.18	And he that finds a treasure is above both.
SIR.40.19	Children and the building of a city establish a 
SIR.40.19	And a blameless wife is counted above both.
SIR.40.20	Wine and music rejoice the heart;
SIR.40.20	And the love of wisdom is above both.
SIR.40.21	The pipe and the lute make pleasant melody;
SIR.40.21	And a pleasant tongue is above both.
SIR.40.22	Your eye shall desire grace and beauty;
SIR.40.22	And above both the green blade of corn.
SIR.40.23	A friend and a companion never meet amiss;
SIR.40.23	And a wife with her husband is above both.
SIR.40.24	Brethren and help are for a time of affliction;
SIR.40.24	And almsgiving is a deliverer above both.
SIR.40.25	Gold and silver will make the foot stand sure;
SIR.40.25	And counsel is esteemed above them both.
SIR.40.26	Riches and strength will lift up the heart;
SIR.40.26	And the fear of the Lord is above both:
SIR.40.26	There is nothing lacking in the fear of the Lord,
SIR.40.26	And there is no need to seek help therein.
SIR.40.27	The fear of the Lord is as a garden of blessing,
SIR.40.27	And covers
SIR.40.28	My son, lead not a beggar’s life;
SIR.40.28	Better it is to die than to beg.
SIR.40.29	A man that looks to the table of another,
SIR.40.29	His life is not to be counted for a life;
SIR.40.29	He will pollute his soul with another man’s meats:
SIR.40.29	But a man wise and well-instructed will beware thereof.
SIR.40.30	In the mouth of the shameless begging will be sweet;
SIR.40.30	And in his belly a fire shall be kindled.
SIR.41.1	O death, how bitter is the remembrance of you to a man that is at peace in his possessions,
SIR.41.1	To the man that has nothing to distract him, and has prosperity in all things,
SIR.41.1	And that still has strength to receive meat!
SIR.41.2	O death, acceptable is your sentence to a man that is needy, and that fails in strength,
SIR.41.2	That is in extreme old age, and is distracted about all things,
SIR.41.2	And is perverse, and has lost patience!
SIR.41.3	Don’t be afraid of the sentence of death;
SIR.41.3	Remember those who have been before you, and that come after:
SIR.41.3	This is the sentence from the Lord over all flesh.
SIR.41.4	And why do you refuse, when it is the good pleasure of the Most High?
SIR.41.4	Whether it be ten, or a hundred, or a thousand years,
SIR.41.4	There is no inquisition of life in
SIR.41.5	The children of sinners are abominable children,
SIR.41.5	And they frequent the dwellings of the ungodly.
SIR.41.6	The inheritance of sinners’ children shall perish,
SIR.41.6	And with their posterity shall be a perpetual reproach.
SIR.41.7	Children will complain of an ungodly father,
SIR.41.7	Because they shall be reproached for his sake.
SIR.41.8	Woe to you, ungodly men,
SIR.41.8	Which have forsaken the law of the Most High God!
SIR.41.9	If you° be born, you° shall be born to a curse;
SIR.41.9	If you° die, a curse shall be your portion.
SIR.41.10	All things that are of the earth shall go back to the earth:
SIR.41.10	So the ungodly shall go from a curse to perdition.
SIR.41.11	The mourning of men is about their bodies:
SIR.41.11	But the name of sinners being evil shall be blotted out.
SIR.41.12	Have regard to your name;
SIR.41.12	For it continues with you longer than a thousand great treasures of gold.
SIR.41.13	A good life has its number of days;
SIR.41.13	And a good name continues forever.
SIR.41.14	My children, keep instruction in peace:
SIR.41.14	But wisdom that is hid, and a treasure that is not seen,
SIR.41.14	What profit is in them both?
SIR.41.15	Better is a man that hides his foolishness
SIR.41.15	Than a man that hides his wisdom.
SIR.41.16	Wherefore show reverence to my word:
SIR.41.16	For it is not good to retain every kind of shame;
SIR.41.16	And not all things are approved by all in good faith.
SIR.41.17	Be ashamed of whoredom before father and mother:
SIR.41.17	And of a lie before a prince and a mighty man;
SIR.41.18	Of an offence before a judge and ruler;
SIR.41.18	Of iniquity before the congregation and the people;
SIR.41.18	Of unjust dealing before a partner and friend;
SIR.41.19	And of theft in regard of the place where you sojourn,
SIR.41.19	And in regard of the truth of God and his covenant;
SIR.41.19	And of leaning with your elbow at meat;
SIR.41.19	And of scurrility in the matter of giving and taking;
SIR.41.20	And of silence before those who salute you;
SIR.41.20	And of looking upon a woman that is a prostitute;
SIR.41.21	And of turning away
SIR.41.21	Of taking away a portion or a gift;
SIR.41.21	And of gazing upon a woman that has a husband;
SIR.41.22	Of being over busy with his maid; and come not near her bed;
SIR.41.22	Of upbraiding speeches before friends;
SIR.41.22	And after you have given, upbraid not;
SIR.41.23	Of repeating and speaking what you have heard;
SIR.41.23	And of revealing of secrets.
SIR.41.24	So shall you be truly shamefast,
SIR.41.24	And find favour in the sight of every man.
SIR.42.1	Of these things be not ashamed,
SIR.42.1	And accept no man’s person to sin 
SIR.42.2	Of the law of the Most High, and his covenant;
SIR.42.2	And of judgement to do justice to the ungodly;
SIR.42.3	Of reckoning with a partner and with travellers;
SIR.42.3	And of a gift from the heritage of friends;
SIR.42.4	Of exactness of balance and weights;
SIR.42.4	And of getting much or little;
SIR.42.5	Of indifferent selling of merchants;
SIR.42.5	And of much correction of children;
SIR.42.5	And of making the side of an evil servant to bleed.
SIR.42.6	And where many hands are, shut you close.
SIR.42.7	Whatsoever you hand over, let it be by number and weight;
SIR.42.7	And in giving and receiving let all be in writing.
SIR.42.8	And one of extreme old age that contends with those that are young;
SIR.42.8	And so shall you be well instructed indeed,
SIR.42.8	And approved in the sight of every man living.
SIR.42.9	A daughter is a secret cause of wakefulness to a father;
SIR.42.9	And the care for her puts away sleep;
SIR.42.9	In her youth, lest she pass the flower of her age;
SIR.42.9	And when she is married, lest she should be hated:
SIR.42.10	In her virginity, lest she should be defiled
SIR.42.10	And be with child in her father’s house;
SIR.42.10	And when she has a husband, lest she should transgress;
SIR.42.10	And when she is married, lest she should be barren.
SIR.42.11	Keep a strict watch over a headstrong daughter,
SIR.42.11	Lest she make you
SIR.42.11	A byword in the city and
SIR.42.11	And shame you before the multitude.
SIR.42.12	Look not upon every body in regard of beauty,
SIR.42.12	And sit not in the midst of women;
SIR.42.13	For from garments comes a moth,
SIR.42.13	And from a woman a woman’s wickedness.
SIR.42.14	Better is the wickedness of a man than a pleasant-dealing woman,
SIR.42.14	And a woman which puts you to shameful reproach.
SIR.42.15	I will make mention now of the works of the Lord,
SIR.42.15	And will declare the things that I have seen:
SIR.42.15	In the words of the Lord are his works.
SIR.42.16	The sun that gives light looks upon all things;
SIR.42.16	And the work of the Lord is full of his glory.
SIR.42.17	The Lord has not given power to the saints to declare all his marvellous works;
SIR.42.17	Which the Almighty Lord firmly settled,
SIR.42.17	That whatever is might be established in his glory.
SIR.42.18	He searches out the deep, and the heart,
SIR.42.18	And he has understanding of their cunning plans:
SIR.42.18	For the Most High knows all knowledge,
SIR.42.18	And he looks into the
SIR.42.19	Declaring the things that are past, and the things that shall be,
SIR.42.19	And revealing the traces of hidden things.
SIR.42.20	No thought escapes him;
SIR.42.20	There is not a word hid from him.
SIR.42.21	The mighty works of his wisdom he has ordered,
SIR.42.21	Who is from everlasting to everlasting:
SIR.42.21	Nothing has been added to them, nor diminished from them;
SIR.42.21	And he had no need of any counsellor.
SIR.42.22	How desirable are all his works!
SIR.42.22	One may behold 
SIR.42.23	All these things live and remain forever in all manner of uses,
SIR.42.23	And they are all obedient.
SIR.42.24	All things are double one against another:
SIR.42.24	And he has made nothing imperfect.
SIR.42.25	One thing establishes the good things of another:
SIR.42.25	And who shall be filled with beholding his glory?
SIR.43.1	The pride of the height is the firmament
SIR.43.1	The appearance of heaven, in the spectacle of its glory.
SIR.43.2	The sun when he appears, bringing tidings as he goes forth,
SIR.43.2	Is a marvellous instrument, the work of the Most High:
SIR.43.3	At his noon he dries up the country,
SIR.43.3	And who shall stand against his burning heat?
SIR.43.4	A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat,
SIR.43.4	Breathing out fiery vapours,
SIR.43.4	And sending forth bright beams, he dims the eyes.
SIR.43.5	Great is the Lord that made him;
SIR.43.5	And at his word he hastens his course.
SIR.43.6	The moon also is in all things for her season,
SIR.43.6	For a declaration of times, and a sign of the world.
SIR.43.7	From the moon is the sign of the feast day;
SIR.43.7	A light that wanes when she is come to the full.
SIR.43.8	The month is called after her name,
SIR.43.8	Increasing wonderfully in her changing;
SIR.43.8	An instrument of the army on high,
SIR.43.8	Shining forth in the firmament of heaven;
SIR.43.9	The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars,
SIR.43.9	An ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord.
SIR.43.10	At the word of the Holy One they will stand in
SIR.43.10	And they will not faint in their watches.
SIR.43.11	Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it;
SIR.43.11	Exceeding beautiful in the brightness thereof.
SIR.43.12	It encircles the heaven round about with a circle of glory;
SIR.43.12	The hands of the Most High have stretched it.
SIR.43.13	By his commandment he makes the snow to fall apace,
SIR.43.13	And sends swiftly the lightnings of his judgement.
SIR.43.14	By reason thereof the treasure-houses are opened;
SIR.43.14	And clouds fly forth as fowls.
SIR.43.15	By his mighty power he makes strong the clouds,
SIR.43.15	And the hailstones are broken small:
SIR.43.16	And at his appearing the mountains will be shaken,
SIR.43.16	And at his will the south wind will blow.
SIR.43.17	The voice of his thunder makes the earth to travail;
SIR.43.17	So does the northern storm and the whirlwind:
SIR.43.17	As birds flying down he sprinkles the snow;
SIR.43.17	And as the lighting of the locust is the falling down thereof:
SIR.43.18	The eye will marvel at the beauty of its whiteness,
SIR.43.18	And the heart will be astonished at the raining of it.
SIR.43.19	The hoar frost also he pours on the earth as salt;
SIR.43.19	And when it is congealed, it is 
SIR.43.20	The cold north wind shall blow,
SIR.43.20	And the ice shall be congealed on the water:
SIR.43.20	It shall lodge upon every gathering together of water,
SIR.43.20	And the water shall put on as it were a breastplate.
SIR.43.21	It shall devour the mountains, and burn up the wilderness,
SIR.43.21	And consume the green herb as fire.
SIR.43.22	A mist coming speedily is the healing of all things;
SIR.43.22	A dew coming after heat shall bring cheerfulness.
SIR.43.23	By his counsel he has stilled the deep,
SIR.43.23	And
SIR.43.24	They that sail on the sea tell of the danger thereof;
SIR.43.24	And when we hear it with our ears, we marvel.
SIR.43.25	Therein be also those strange and wondrous works,
SIR.43.25	Variety of all that has life, the
SIR.43.26	By reason of him his end has success,
SIR.43.26	And by his word all things consist.
SIR.43.27	We may say many things, yet shall we not attain;
SIR.43.27	And the sum of our words is, He is all.
SIR.43.28	How shall we have strength to glorify him?
SIR.43.28	For he is himself the great one above all his works.
SIR.43.29	The Lord is terrible and exceedingly great;
SIR.43.29	And marvellous is his power.
SIR.43.30	When you° glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as you° can;
SIR.43.30	For even yet he will exceed:
SIR.43.30	And when you° exalt him, put forth your full strength:
SIR.43.30	Be not weary; for you° will never attain.
SIR.43.31	Who has seen him, that he may declare him?
SIR.43.31	And who shall magnify him as he is?
SIR.43.32	Many things are hidden greater than these;
SIR.43.32	For we have seen but a few of his works.
SIR.43.33	For the Lord made all things;
SIR.43.33	And to the godly gave he wisdom.
SIR.44.1	Let us now praise famous men,
SIR.44.1	And our fathers that became the father of us.
SIR.44.2	The Lord
SIR.44.3	Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms,
SIR.44.3	And were men renowned for their power,
SIR.44.3	Such as have brought tidings in prophecies:
SIR.44.4	Leaders of the people by their counsels,
SIR.44.4	And by their understanding
SIR.44.4	Wise 
SIR.44.5	Such as sought out musical tunes,
SIR.44.5	And set forth verses in writing:
SIR.44.6	Rich men furnished with ability,
SIR.44.6	Living peaceably in their habitations:
SIR.44.7	All these were honoured in their generations,
SIR.44.7	And were a glory in their days.
SIR.44.8	There be of them, that have left a name behind them,
SIR.44.8	To declare their praises.
SIR.44.9	And some there be, which have no memorial;
SIR.44.9	Who are perished as though they had not been,
SIR.44.9	And are become as though they had not been born;
SIR.44.9	And their children after them.
SIR.44.10	But these were men of mercy,
SIR.44.10	Whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten.
SIR.44.11	With their seed shall remain continually a good inheritance;
SIR.44.11	Their children 
SIR.44.12	Their seed stands fast,
SIR.44.12	And their children for their sakes.
SIR.44.13	Their seed shall remain forever,
SIR.44.13	And their glory shall not be blotted out.
SIR.44.14	Their bodies were buried in peace,
SIR.44.14	And their name lives to all generations.
SIR.44.15	Peoples will declare their wisdom,
SIR.44.15	And the congregation tells out their praise.
SIR.44.16	Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated,
SIR.44.17	Noah was found perfect 
SIR.44.17	In the season of wrath he was taken in exchange 
SIR.44.17	Therefore was there left a remnant to the earth,
SIR.44.17	When the flood came.
SIR.44.18	Everlasting covenants were made with him,
SIR.44.18	That all flesh should no more be blotted out by a flood.
SIR.44.19	Abraham was a great father of a multitude of nations;
SIR.44.19	And there was none found like him in glory;
SIR.44.20	Who kept the law of the Most High,
SIR.44.20	And was taken into covenant with him:
SIR.44.20	In his flesh he established the covenant;
SIR.44.20	And when he was proved, he was found faithful.
SIR.44.21	Therefore he assured him by an oath,
SIR.44.21	That the nations should be blessed in his seed;
SIR.44.21	That he would multiply him as the dust of the earth,
SIR.44.21	And exalt his seed as the stars,
SIR.44.21	And cause them to inherit from sea to sea,
SIR.44.21	And from the River to the utmost part of the earth.
SIR.44.22	In Isaac also did he establish likewise, for Abraham his father’s sake,
SIR.44.22	The blessing of all men, and the covenant:
SIR.44.23	And he made it rest upon the head of Jacob;
SIR.44.23	He acknowledged him in his blessings,
SIR.44.23	And gave to him by inheritance,
SIR.44.23	And divided his portions;
SIR.44.23	Amongst twelve tribes did he part them.
SIR.45.1	And he brought out of him a man of mercy,
SIR.45.1	Which found favour in the sight of all flesh;
SIR.45.1	A man beloved of God and men, even Moses,
SIR.45.1	Whose memorial is blessed.
SIR.45.2	He made him like to the glory of the saints,
SIR.45.2	And magnified him in the fears of his enemies.
SIR.45.3	By his words he caused the wonders to cease;
SIR.45.3	He glorified him in the sight of kings;
SIR.45.3	He gave him commandment for his people,
SIR.45.3	And showed him part of his glory.
SIR.45.4	He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness;
SIR.45.4	He chose him out of all flesh.
SIR.45.5	He made him to hear his voice,
SIR.45.5	And led him into the thick darkness,
SIR.45.5	And gave him commandments face to face,
SIR.45.5	Even the law of life and knowledge,
SIR.45.5	That he might teach Jacob the covenant,
SIR.45.5	And Israel his judgements.
SIR.45.6	He exalted Aaron, a holy man like to him,
SIR.45.6	Even his brother, of the tribe of Levi.
SIR.45.7	He established for him an everlasting covenant,
SIR.45.7	And gave him the priesthood of the people;
SIR.45.7	He
SIR.45.7	And girded him about with a robe of glory.
SIR.45.8	He clothed him with the perfection of exultation;
SIR.45.8	And strengthened him with apparel of
SIR.45.8	The linen trousers, the long robe, and the ephod.
SIR.45.9	And he compassed him with pomegranates of gold,
SIR.45.9	To send forth a sound as he went,
SIR.45.9	To make a sound that might be heard in the temple,
SIR.45.9	For a memorial to the children of his people;
SIR.45.10	With a holy garment, with gold and blue and purple, the work of the embroiderer,
SIR.45.10	With an oracle of judgement, 
SIR.45.11	With twisted scarlet, the work of the craftsman;
SIR.45.11	With precious stones graven like a signet, in a setting of gold, the work of the jeweller,
SIR.45.11	For a memorial engraved in writing, after the number of the tribes of Israel;
SIR.45.12	With a crown of gold upon the mitre,
SIR.45.12	An ornament of honour, a work of might,
SIR.45.12	The desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful.
SIR.45.13	Before him there never have been any such;
SIR.45.13	No stranger put them on, but his sons only, and his offspring perpertually.
SIR.45.14	His sacrifices shall be wholly consumed
SIR.45.14	Every day twice continually.
SIR.45.15	Moses
SIR.45.15	And anointed him with holy oil:
SIR.45.15	It was to him for an everlasting covenant,
SIR.45.15	And to his seed, all the days of heaven,
SIR.45.15	To minister to him, and to execute also the priest’s office,
SIR.45.15	And bless his people in his name.
SIR.45.16	He chose him out of all living
SIR.45.16	To offer sacrifice to the Lord,
SIR.45.16	Incense, and a sweet savour, for a memorial,
SIR.45.16	To make reconciliation for your people.
SIR.45.17	He gave to him in his commandments,
SIR.45.17	To teach Jacob the testimonies,
SIR.45.17	And to enlighten Israel in his law.
SIR.45.18	Strangers gathered themselves together against him,
SIR.45.18	And envied him in the wilderness,
SIR.45.18	And the congregation of Korah, with wrath and anger.
SIR.45.19	The Lord saw it, and it displeased him;
SIR.45.19	And in the wrath of his anger they were destroyed:
SIR.45.19	He did wonders upon them,
SIR.45.19	To consume them with flaming fire.
SIR.45.20	And he added glory to Aaron,
SIR.45.20	And gave him a heritage:
SIR.45.20	He divided to him the first fruits of the increase;
SIR.45.21	For they shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord,
SIR.45.21	Which he gave to him and to his seed.
SIR.45.22	However in the land of the people he shall have no inheritance,
SIR.45.22	And he has no portion amongst the people:
SIR.45.22	For he himself is your portion 
SIR.45.23	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar is the third in glory,
SIR.45.23	In that he was zealous in the fear of the Lord,
SIR.45.23	And stood fast in the good forwardness of his soul when the people turned away,
SIR.45.23	And he made reconciliation for Israel.
SIR.45.24	Therefore was there a covenant of peace established for him,
SIR.45.24	That he and his seed
SIR.45.24	Should have the dignity of the priesthood forever.
SIR.45.25	Also 
SIR.45.25	The inheritance of the king is his alone from son to son;
SIR.45.25	So the inheritance of Aaron is also to his seed.
SIR.45.26	To judge his people in righteousness,
SIR.45.26	That their good things be not abolished,
SIR.45.26	And 
SIR.46.1	Joshua the son of
SIR.46.1	And was the successor of Moses in prophecies:
SIR.46.1	Who according to his name was made great
SIR.46.1	For the saving of
SIR.46.1	To take vengeance of the enemies that rose up against them,
SIR.46.1	That he might give Israel their inheritance.
SIR.46.2	How was he glorified in the lifting up his hands,
SIR.46.2	And in stretching out his sword against the cities!
SIR.46.3	Who before him so stood fast?
SIR.46.3	For the Lord himself brought his enemies to him.
SIR.46.4	Did not the sun go back by his hand?
SIR.46.4	And didn’t one day become as two?
SIR.46.5	He called upon the Most High 
SIR.46.5	When his foes pressed him round about;
SIR.46.5	And the great Lord heard him.
SIR.46.6	With hailstones of mighty power
SIR.46.6	He caused war to break violently upon the nation,
SIR.46.6	And
SIR.46.6	That the nations might know his
SIR.46.6	How that he fought in the sight of the Lord;
SIR.46.6	For he followed after the Mighty One.
SIR.46.7	Also in the time of Moses he did a work of mercy,
SIR.46.7	He and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
SIR.46.7	In that they withstood the adversary,
SIR.46.7	Hindered the people from sin,
SIR.46.7	And stilled the murmuring of wickedness.
SIR.46.8	And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two alone were preserved
SIR.46.8	To bring them into the heritage,
SIR.46.8	Even into a land flowing with milk and honey.
SIR.46.9	Also the Lord gave strength to Caleb,
SIR.46.9	And it remained with him to his old age;
SIR.46.9	So that he entered upon the height of the land,
SIR.46.9	And his seed obtained it for a heritage:
SIR.46.10	That all the children of Israel might see
SIR.46.10	That it is good to walk after the Lord.
SIR.46.11	Also the judges, every one by his name,
SIR.46.11	All whose hearts went not a whoring,
SIR.46.11	And who turned not away from the Lord,
SIR.46.11	May their memorial be blessed.
SIR.46.12	May their bones flourish again out of their place,
SIR.46.12	And may the name of those who have been honoured be renewed upon their children.
SIR.46.13	Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord,
SIR.46.13	Established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people.
SIR.46.14	By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation,
SIR.46.14	And the Lord visited Jacob.
SIR.46.15	By his faithfulness he was proved to be a prophet,
SIR.46.15	And by his words he was known to be faithful in vision.
SIR.46.16	Also when his enemies pressed him round about
SIR.46.16	He called upon the Lord, the Mighty One,
SIR.46.16	With the offering of the sucking lamb.
SIR.46.17	And the Lord thundered from heaven,
SIR.46.17	And with a mighty sound made his voice to be heard.
SIR.46.18	And he utterly destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians,
SIR.46.18	And all the princes of the Philistines.
SIR.46.19	Also before the time of his
SIR.46.19	He made protestations in the sight of the lord and 
SIR.46.19	I have not taken any man’s goods, so much as a sandal:
SIR.46.19	And no man did accuse him.
SIR.46.20	And after he fell asleep he prophesied,
SIR.46.20	And showed the king his end,
SIR.46.20	And lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy,
SIR.46.20	To blot out the wickedness of the people.
SIR.47.1	And after him rose up Nathan
SIR.47.1	To prophesy in the days of David.
SIR.47.2	As is the fat when it is separated from the peace offering,
SIR.47.2	So was David 
SIR.47.3	He played with lions as with kids,
SIR.47.3	And with bears as with lambs of the flock.
SIR.47.4	In his youth did he not kill a giant,
SIR.47.4	And take away reproach from the people,
SIR.47.4	When he lifted up his hand with a sling stone,
SIR.47.4	And beat down the boasting of Goliath?
SIR.47.5	For he called upon the Most High Lord;
SIR.47.5	And he gave him strength in his right hand,
SIR.47.5	To kill a man mighty in war,
SIR.47.5	To exalt the horn of his people.
SIR.47.6	So they glorified him for 
SIR.47.6	And praised him for the blessings of the Lord,
SIR.47.6	In that there was given him a diadem of glory.
SIR.47.7	For he destroyed the enemies on every side,
SIR.47.7	And brought to nothing the Philistines his adversaries,
SIR.47.7	Brake their horn in pieces to this day.
SIR.47.8	In every work of his he gave thanks to the Holy One Most High with words of glory;
SIR.47.8	With his whole heart he sang praise,
SIR.47.8	And loved him that made him.
SIR.47.9	Also he set singers before the altar,
SIR.47.9	And to make sweet melody by their music.
SIR.47.10	He gave beauty to the feasts,
SIR.47.10	And set in order the seasons to perfection,
SIR.47.10	While they praised his holy name,
SIR.47.10	And the sanctuary sounded from early morning.
SIR.47.11	The Lord took away his sins,
SIR.47.11	And exalted his horn forever;
SIR.47.11	And gave him a covenant of kings,
SIR.47.11	And a throne of glory in Israel.
SIR.47.12	After him rose up a son, a man of understanding;
SIR.47.12	And for his sake he lived at large.
SIR.47.13	Solomon reigned in days of peace;
SIR.47.13	And to him God gave rest round about,
SIR.47.13	That he might set up a house for his name,
SIR.47.13	And prepare a sanctuary forever.
SIR.47.14	How wise you were made in your youth,
SIR.47.14	And filled as a river with understanding!
SIR.47.15	Your soul covered the earth,
SIR.47.15	And you filled it with
SIR.47.16	Your name reached to the isles afar off;
SIR.47.16	And for your peace you were beloved.
SIR.47.17	For your songs and proverbs and parables,
SIR.47.17	And for your interpretations, the countries marvelled at you.
SIR.47.18	By the name of the Lord God,
SIR.47.18	Which is called the God of Israel,
SIR.47.18	You did gather gold as tin,
SIR.47.18	And did multiply silver as lead.
SIR.47.19	You did bow your loins to women,
SIR.47.19	And in your body you were brought into subjection.
SIR.47.20	You did blemish your honour,
SIR.47.20	And profane your seed,
SIR.47.20	To bring wrath upon your children;
SIR.47.20	And I was grieved for your folly:
SIR.47.21	So that the sovereignty was divided,
SIR.47.21	And out of Ephraim ruled a disobedient kingdom.
SIR.47.22	But the Lord will never forsake his mercy;
SIR.47.22	And he will not destroy any of his works,
SIR.47.22	Nor blot out the posterity of his elect;
SIR.47.22	And the seed of him that loved him he will not take away;
SIR.47.22	And he gave a remnant to Jacob,
SIR.47.22	And to David a root out of him.
SIR.47.23	And 
SIR.47.23	And of his seed he left behind him Rehoboam,
SIR.47.23	Who made the people to revolt by his counsel.
SIR.47.23	Also Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
SIR.47.23	Who made Israel to sin,
SIR.47.23	And gave to Ephraim a way of sin.
SIR.47.24	And their sins were multiplied exceedingly,
SIR.47.24	To remove them from their land.
SIR.47.25	For they sought out all manner of wickedness,
SIR.47.25	Till vengeance should come upon them.
SIR.48.1	Also there arose Elijah the prophet as fire,
SIR.48.1	And his word burnt like a torch:
SIR.48.2	Who brought a famine upon them,
SIR.48.2	And by his zeal made them few in number.
SIR.48.3	By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven:
SIR.48.3	Thrice did he thus bring down fire.
SIR.48.4	How you were glorified, O Elijah, in your wondrous deeds!
SIR.48.4	And who shall glory like to you?
SIR.48.5	Who did raise up a dead man from death,
SIR.48.5	And from
SIR.48.6	Who brought down kings to destruction,
SIR.48.6	And honourable men from their bed:
SIR.48.7	Who heard rebuke in Sinai,
SIR.48.7	And judgements of vengeance in Horeb:
SIR.48.8	Who anointed kings for retribution,
SIR.48.8	And prophets to succeed after him:
SIR.48.9	Who was taken up in a tempest of fire,
SIR.48.9	In a chariot of fiery horses:
SIR.48.10	Who was recorded for reproofs in their seasons,
SIR.48.10	To pacify anger, before it brake forth into wrath;
SIR.48.10	To turn the heart of the father to the son,
SIR.48.10	And to restore the tribes of Jacob.
SIR.48.11	Blessed are those who saw you,
SIR.48.11	And those who have been beautified with love;
SIR.48.11	For we also shall surely live.
SIR.48.12	Elijah 
SIR.48.12	And Elisha was filled with his spirit;
SIR.48.12	And in 
SIR.48.12	And no one brought him into subjection.
SIR.48.13	And when he was laid on sleep his body prophesied.
SIR.48.14	As in his life he did wonders,
SIR.48.14	So in death were his works marvellous.
SIR.48.15	For all this the people repented not,
SIR.48.15	And they departed not from their sins,
SIR.48.15	Till they were carried away as a plunder from their land,
SIR.48.15	And were scattered through all the earth;
SIR.48.15	And the people was left very few in number,
SIR.48.15	And a ruler 
SIR.48.16	Some of them did that which was pleasing 
SIR.48.16	And some multiplied sins.
SIR.48.17	Hezekiah fortified his city,
SIR.48.17	And brought in
SIR.48.17	He digged the sheer rock with iron,
SIR.48.17	And built up wells for waters.
SIR.48.18	In his days Sennacherib came up,
SIR.48.18	And sent Rabshakeh, and departed;
SIR.48.18	And he lifted up his hand against Sion,
SIR.48.18	And boasted great things in his arrogance.
SIR.48.19	Then were their hearts and their hands shaken,
SIR.48.19	And they were in pain, as women in travail;
SIR.48.20	And they called upon the Lord which is merciful,
SIR.48.20	Spreading forth their hands to him:
SIR.48.20	And the Holy One heard them speedily out of Heaven,
SIR.48.20	And delivered them by the hand of Isaiah.
SIR.48.21	He struck the camp of the Assyrians,
SIR.48.21	And his angel utterly destroyed them.
SIR.48.22	For Hezekiah did that which was pleasing to the Lord,
SIR.48.22	And was strong in the ways of David his father,
SIR.48.22	Which Isaiah the prophet commanded,
SIR.48.22	Who was great and faithful in his vision.
SIR.48.23	In his days the sun went backward;
SIR.48.23	And he added life to the king.
SIR.48.24	He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last;
SIR.48.24	And he comforted those who mourned in Sion.
SIR.48.25	He showed the things that should be to the end of time,
SIR.48.25	And the hidden things or ever they came.
SIR.49.1	The memorial of Josiah is like the composition of incense
SIR.49.1	Prepared by the work of the apothecary:
SIR.49.1	It shall be sweet as honey in every mouth,
SIR.49.1	And as music at a banquet of wine.
SIR.49.2	He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people,
SIR.49.2	And took away the abominations of iniquity.
SIR.49.3	He set his heart right towards the Lord;
SIR.49.3	In the days of wicked men he made godliness to prevail.
SIR.49.4	Except David and Hezekiah and Josiah,
SIR.49.4	All committed trespass:
SIR.49.4	For they forsook the law of the Most High;
SIR.49.4	The kings of Judah failed.
SIR.49.5	For they gave their
SIR.49.5	And their glory to a strange nation.
SIR.49.6	They set on fire the chosen city of the sanctuary,
SIR.49.6	And made her streets desolate, 
SIR.49.7	For they mistreated him;
SIR.49.7	And yet he was sanctified in the womb to be a prophet,
SIR.49.7	To root out, and to afflict, and to destroy;
SIR.49.8	Which 
SIR.49.9	For truly he remembered the enemies in
SIR.49.9	And to do good to those who directed their ways aright.
SIR.49.10	Also of the twelve prophets
SIR.49.10	May the bones flourish again out of their place.
SIR.49.10	And he comforted Jacob,
SIR.49.10	And delivered them by confidence of hope.
SIR.49.11	How shall we magnify Zerubbabel?
SIR.49.11	And he was as a signet on the right hand:
SIR.49.12	So was Jesus the son of Josedek:
SIR.49.12	Who in their days built the house,
SIR.49.12	And exalted a
SIR.49.12	Prepared for everlasting glory.
SIR.49.13	Also of Nehemiah the memorial is great;
SIR.49.13	Who raised up for us the walls that were fallen,
SIR.49.13	And set up the gates and bars,
SIR.49.13	And raised up our homes again.
SIR.49.14	No man was created upon the earth such as was Enoch;
SIR.49.14	For he was taken up from the earth.
SIR.49.15	Neither was there a man born like to Joseph,
SIR.49.15	A governor of his kindred, a stay of the people:
SIR.49.15	Yes, his bones were visited.
SIR.49.16	Shem and Seth were glorified amongst men;
SIR.49.16	And above every living thing in the creation is Adam.
SIR.50.1	Who in his life repaired the house,
SIR.50.1	And in his days strengthened the temple:
SIR.50.2	And by him was built from the foundation the height of the double 
SIR.50.2	The lofty underworks of the inclosure of the temple:
SIR.50.3	In his days the cistern of waters was
SIR.50.3	The brazen vessel in compass as the sea.
SIR.50.4	And fortified the city
SIR.50.5	How glorious was he when the people gathered round him
SIR.50.5	At his coming forth out of the
SIR.50.6	As the morning star in the midst of a cloud,
SIR.50.6	As the moon at the full:
SIR.50.7	As the sun shining forth upon the temple of the Most High,
SIR.50.7	And as the rainbow giving light in clouds of glory:
SIR.50.8	As the flower of roses in the days of new 
SIR.50.8	As lilies at the water spring,
SIR.50.8	As the shoot of the frankincense tree in the time of summer:
SIR.50.9	As fire and incense in the censer,
SIR.50.9	As a vessel all of beaten gold
SIR.50.9	Adorned with all manner of precious stones:
SIR.50.10	As an olive tree budding forth fruits,
SIR.50.10	And as a cypress growing high amongst the clouds.
SIR.50.11	When he took up the robe of glory,
SIR.50.11	And put on the perfection of exultation,
SIR.50.11	In the ascent of the holy altar,
SIR.50.11	He made glorious the precinct of the sanctuary.
SIR.50.12	And when he received the portions out of the priests’ hands,
SIR.50.12	Himself also standing by the hearth of the altar,
SIR.50.12	His kindred as a garland round about him,
SIR.50.12	He was as a young cedar in Libanus;
SIR.50.12	And as stems of palm trees compassed they him round about,
SIR.50.13	And all the sons of Aaron in their glory,
SIR.50.13	And the Lord’s offering in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel.
SIR.50.14	And finishing the service at the altars,
SIR.50.14	That he might adorn the offering of the Most High, the Almighty,
SIR.50.15	He stretched out his hand to the
SIR.50.15	And poured out the cup of the grape;
SIR.50.15	He poured out at the foot of the altar
SIR.50.15	A sweet smelling savour to the Most High, the King of all.
SIR.50.16	Then shouted the sons of Aaron,
SIR.50.16	They sounded the trumpets of beaten work,
SIR.50.16	They made a great noise to be heard,
SIR.50.16	For a remembrance before the Most High.
SIR.50.17	Then all the people together hurried,
SIR.50.17	And fell down upon the earth on their faces
SIR.50.17	To worship their Lord, the Almighty, God Most High.
SIR.50.18	The singers also praised him with their voices;
SIR.50.18	In the whole house was there made sweet melody.
SIR.50.19	And the people implored the Lord Most High,
SIR.50.19	In prayer before him that is merciful.
SIR.50.19	Till the
SIR.50.19	And so they accomplished his service.
SIR.50.20	Then he went down, and lifted up his hands
SIR.50.20	Over the whole congregation of the children of Israel,
SIR.50.20	To give blessing to the Lord with his lips,
SIR.50.20	And to glory in his name.
SIR.50.21	And he bowed himself down in worship the second time,
SIR.50.21	To declare the blessing from the Most High.
SIR.50.22	And now bless the God of all,
SIR.50.22	who everywhere does great things,
SIR.50.22	who exalts our days from the womb,
SIR.50.22	and deals with us according to his mercy.
SIR.50.23	May he grant us joyfulness of heart,
SIR.50.23	And that peace may be in our days in Israel for the days of eternity:
SIR.50.24	To entrust his mercy with us;
SIR.50.24	And let him deliver us in his time!
SIR.50.25	With two nations is my soul vexed,
SIR.50.25	And the third is no nation:
SIR.50.26	They that sit upon the mountain of
SIR.50.26	And that foolish people that dwells in Sichem.
SIR.50.27	I have
SIR.50.27	I Jesus, the son of Sirach Eleazar, of Jerusalem,
SIR.50.27	Who out of his heart poured forth wisdom.
SIR.50.28	Blessed is he that shall be exercised in these things;
SIR.50.28	And he that lays them up in his heart shall become wise.
SIR.50.29	For if he do them, he shall be strong to all things:
SIR.50.29	For the light of the Lord is his
SIR.51.1	I will give thanks to you, O Lord, O King,
SIR.51.1	And will praise you, O God my Saviour:
SIR.51.1	I do give thanks to your name:
SIR.51.2	For you were my protector and helper,
SIR.51.2	And did deliver my body out of destruction,
SIR.51.2	And out of the snare of a slanderous tongue,
SIR.51.2	From lips that forge lies,
SIR.51.2	And was my helper before those who stood by;
SIR.51.3	And did deliver me, according to the abundance of your mercy, and 
SIR.51.3	From the gnashings 
SIR.51.3	Out of the hand of such as sought my life,
SIR.51.3	Out of the manifold afflictions which I had;
SIR.51.4	From the choking of a fire on every side,
SIR.51.4	And out of the midst of fire which I kindled not;
SIR.51.5	Out of the depth of the belly of
SIR.51.5	And from an unclean tongue,
SIR.51.5	And from lying words,
SIR.51.6	The slander of an unrighteous tongue to the king.
SIR.51.6	My soul drew near even to death,
SIR.51.6	And my life was near to
SIR.51.7	They compassed me on every side,
SIR.51.7	And there was none to help 
SIR.51.7	And it was not.
SIR.51.8	And I remembered your mercy, O Lord,
SIR.51.8	And your working which has been from everlasting,
SIR.51.8	How you deliver those who wait for you,
SIR.51.8	And save them out of the hand of the enemies.
SIR.51.9	And I lifted up my supplication from the earth,
SIR.51.9	And prayed for deliverance from death.
SIR.51.10	I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord,
SIR.51.10	That he would not forsake me in the days of affliction,
SIR.51.10	In the time when there was no help against the proud.
SIR.51.11	I will praise your name continually,
SIR.51.11	And will sing praise with thanksgiving;
SIR.51.11	And my supplication was heard:
SIR.51.12	For you saved me from destruction,
SIR.51.12	And delivered me from the evil time:
SIR.51.12	Therefore I will give thanks and praise to you,
SIR.51.12	And bless the name of the Lord.
SIR.51.13	When I was yet young,
SIR.51.13	Or ever I went abroad,
SIR.51.13	I sought wisdom openly in my prayer.
SIR.51.14	Before the temple I asked for her,
SIR.51.14	And I will seek her out even to the end.
SIR.51.15	From 
SIR.51.15	My foot trod in uprightness,
SIR.51.15	From my youth I tracked her out.
SIR.51.16	I bowed down my ear a little, and received her,
SIR.51.16	And found for myself much instruction.
SIR.51.17	I profited in her:
SIR.51.17	To him that gives me wisdom I will give glory.
SIR.51.18	For I purposed to practise her,
SIR.51.18	And I was zealous for that which is good;
SIR.51.18	And I shall never be put to shame.
SIR.51.19	My soul has wrestled in her,
SIR.51.19	And in my doing I was exact:
SIR.51.19	I spread forth my hands to the heaven above,
SIR.51.19	And bewailed my ignorances of her.
SIR.51.20	I set my soul aright to her,
SIR.51.20	And in pureness I found her.
SIR.51.20	I got me a heart 
SIR.51.20	Therefore shall I not be forsaken.
SIR.51.21	My inward part also was troubled to seek her:
SIR.51.21	Therefore I have gotten a good possession.
SIR.51.22	The Lord gave me a tongue for my reward;
SIR.51.22	And I will praise him therewith.
SIR.51.23	Draw near to me, you° unlearned,
SIR.51.23	And lodge in the house of instruction.
SIR.51.24	Say, wherefore are you° lacking in these things,
SIR.51.24	And your souls are very thirsty?
SIR.51.25	I opened my mouth, and spoke,
SIR.51.25	Get her for yourselves without money.
SIR.51.26	Put your neck under the yoke,
SIR.51.26	And let your soul receive instruction:
SIR.51.26	She is hard at hand to find.
SIR.51.27	Behold with your eyes,
SIR.51.27	How that I laboured but a little,
SIR.51.27	And found for myself much rest.
SIR.51.28	Get you instruction with a great sum of silver,
SIR.51.28	And gain much gold by her.
SIR.51.29	May your soul rejoice in his mercy,
SIR.51.29	And may you° not be put to shame in praising him.
SIR.51.30	Work your work before the time comes,
SIR.51.30	And in his time he will give you your reward.
BAR.1.1	These are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maaseas, the son of Sedekias, the son of Asadias, the son of Helkias, wrote in Babylon, 
BAR.1.2	in the fifth year, 
BAR.1.3	And Baruch did read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joakim king of Judah, and in the hearing of all the people that came to 
BAR.1.4	and in the hearing of the mighty men, and of the kings’ sons, and in the hearing of the elders, and in the hearing of all the people, from the least to the greatest, even of all those who lived at Babylon by the river Sud. 
BAR.1.5	And they wept, and fasted,
BAR.1.6	they made also a collection of money according to every man’s power: 
BAR.1.7	and they sent 
BAR.1.8	at the same time when he took the vessels of the house of the Lord, that had been carried out of the temple, to return 
BAR.1.9	after Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, and the princes, and the captives, and the mighty men, and the people of the land, from Jerusalem, and brought them to Babylon. 
BAR.1.10	And they said, Behold, we have sent you money; buy you therefore with the money burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare an oblation, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God; 
BAR.1.11	and pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and for the life of Baltasar his son, that their days may be
BAR.1.12	and the Lord will give us strength, and lighten our eyes, and we shall live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Baltasar his son, and we shall serve them many days, and find favour in their sight. 
BAR.1.13	Pray for us also to the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God; and to this day the wrath of the Lord and his indignation is not turned from us. 
BAR.1.14	And you° shall read this book which we have sent to you, to make confession in the house of the Lord, upon the day of the feast and on the days of the solemn assembly.
BAR.1.15	And you° shall say, To the Lord our God 
BAR.1.16	and to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers: 
BAR.1.17	for that we have sinned before the Lord, 
BAR.1.18	and disobeyed him, and have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the commandments of the Lord that he has set before us: 
BAR.1.19	since the day that the Lord brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to this present day, we have been disobedient to the Lord our God, and we have dealt unadvisedly in not listening to his voice. 
BAR.1.20	Wherefore the plagues clave to us, and the curse, which the Lord commanded Moses his servant 
BAR.1.21	Nevertheless we didn’t listen to the voice of the Lord our God, according to all the words of the prophets, whom he sent to us: 
BAR.1.22	but we walked every man in the imagination of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods, and to do that which is evil in the sight of the Lord our God.
BAR.2.1	Therefore the Lord has made good his word, which he pronounced against us, and against our judges that judged Israel, and against our kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Judah, 
BAR.2.2	to bring upon us great plagues, such as never happened under the whole heaven,
BAR.2.3	That we should eat every man the flesh of his own son, and every man the flesh of his own daughter. 
BAR.2.4	Moreover he has given them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are round about us, to be a reproach and a desolation amongst all the people round about, where the Lord has scattered them. 
BAR.2.5	Thus were they cast down, and not exalted, because we sinned against the Lord our God, in not listening to his voice. 
BAR.2.6	To the Lord our God 
BAR.2.7	 all these plagues are come upon us, which the Lord has pronounced against us. 
BAR.2.8	Yet have we not entreated the favour of the Lord, in turning every one from the thoughts of his wicked heart. 
BAR.2.9	Therefore has the Lord kept watch over the plagues, and the Lord has brought 
BAR.2.10	Yet we have not listened to his voice, to walk in the commandments of the Lord that he has set before us.
BAR.2.11	And now, O Lord, you God of Israel, that have brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with signs, and with wonders, and with great power, and with a high arm, and have gotten yourself a name, as at this day: 
BAR.2.12	O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have been ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all your ordinances. 
BAR.2.13	Let your wrath turn from us: for we are but a few left amongst the heathen, where you have scattered us. 
BAR.2.14	Hear our prayer, O Lord, and our petition, and deliver us for your own sake, and give us favour in the sight of them which have led us away captive: 
BAR.2.15	that all the earth may know that you are the Lord our God, because Israel and his posterity is called by your name. 
BAR.2.16	O Lord, look down from your holy house, and consider us: incline your ear, O Lord, and hear: 
BAR.2.17	open your eyes, and behold: for the dead that are in
BAR.2.18	but the soul that is greatly vexed, which goes stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give you glory and righteousness, O Lord. 
BAR.2.19	For we do not present our supplication before you, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings. 
BAR.2.20	For you have sent your wrath and your indignation upon us, as you have spoken by your servants the prophets, 
BAR.2.21	The Lord says, Bow your shoulders to serve the king of Babylon, and remain in the land that I gave to your fathers. 
BAR.2.22	But if you° will not hear the voice of the Lord, to serve the king of Babylon, 
BAR.2.23	I will cause to cease out of the cities of Judah, and from the region near Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and the whole land shall be desolate without inhabitant. 
BAR.2.24	But we would not listen to your voice, to serve the king of Babylon: therefore have you made good your words that you spoke by your servants the prophets, 
BAR.2.25	And, behold, they are cast out to the heat by day, and to the frost by night, and they died in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by
BAR.2.26	And the house which is called by your name have you laid 
BAR.2.27	Yet, O Lord our God, you have dealt with us after all your kindness, and according to all your great mercy, 
BAR.2.28	as you spoke by your servant Moses in the day when you did command him to write your law before the children of Israel, saying, 
BAR.2.29	If you° will not hear my voice, surely this very great multitude shall be turned into a small 
BAR.2.30	For I know that they will not hear me, because it is a stiff-necked people: but in the land of their captivity they shall take it to heart, 
BAR.2.31	and shall know that I am the Lord their God: and I will give them a heart, and ears to hear: 
BAR.2.32	and they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and think upon my name, 
BAR.2.33	and shall return from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord. 
BAR.2.34	And I will bring them again into the land which I sware to their fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and they shall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished. 
BAR.2.35	And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more remove my people Israel out of the land that I have given them.
BAR.3.1	O Lord Almighty, you God of Israel, the soul in anguish, the troubled spirit, cries to you. 
BAR.3.2	Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; for you are a merciful God: yes, have mercy upon us, because we have sinned before you. 
BAR.3.3	For you sit 
BAR.3.4	O Lord Almighty, you God of Israel, hear now the prayer of
BAR.3.5	Remember not the iniquities of our fathers: but remember your power and your name 
BAR.3.6	For you are the Lord our God, and you, O Lord, will we praise. 
BAR.3.7	For for this cause you have put your fear in our hearts,
BAR.3.8	Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity, where you have scattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject to penalty, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, which departed from the Lord our God.
BAR.3.9	Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life: give ear to understand wisdom. 
BAR.3.10	How is it, O Israel, that you are in your enemies’ land, that you have become old in a strange country, that you are defiled with the dead, 
BAR.3.11	that you are counted with those who 
BAR.3.12	You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom. 
BAR.3.13	 if you had walked in the way of God, you should have dwelled in peace forever. 
BAR.3.14	Learn where is
BAR.3.15	Who has found out her place? and who has come into her treasuries? 
BAR.3.16	Where are the princes of the heathen, and such as ruled the beasts that are upon the earth; 
BAR.3.17	those who had their pastime with the fowls of the air, and those who hoarded up silver and gold, wherein men trust; and of whose getting there is no end? 
BAR.3.18	For those who
BAR.3.19	they are vanished and gone down to
BAR.3.20	Younger men have seen the light, and lived upon the earth: but the way of knowledge have they not known, 
BAR.3.21	neither understood they the paths thereof: neither have their children embraced it: they are far off from
BAR.3.22	It has not been heard of in Canaan, neither has it been seen in Teman. 
BAR.3.23	The sons also of Agar that seek understanding, which are in the land, the merchants of Merran and Teman, and the authors of fables, and the searchers out of understanding; none of these have known the way of wisdom, or remembered her paths. 
BAR.3.24	O Israel, how great is the house of God! and how large is the place of his possession! 
BAR.3.25	great, and has none end; high, and unmeasurable. 
BAR.3.26	There were the giants born that were famous of old, great of stature, 
BAR.3.27	God didn’t choose these, nor did he give the way of knowledge to them; 
BAR.3.28	so they perished, because they had no
BAR.3.29	Who has gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds? 
BAR.3.30	Who has gone over the sea, and found her, and will bring her for choice gold? 
BAR.3.31	There is none that knows her way, nor any that comprehends her path. 
BAR.3.32	But he that knows all things knows her, he found her out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth for evermore has filled it with four-footed beasts: 
BAR.3.33	he that sends forth the light, and it goes; he called it, and it obeyed him with fear: 
BAR.3.34	and the stars shone in their watches, and were glad: when he called them, they said, “Here we are.” They shone with gladness to him that made them. 
BAR.3.35	This is our God, 
BAR.3.36	He has found out all the way of knowledge, and has given it to Jacob his servant, and to Israel that is beloved of him. 
BAR.3.37	Afterward did she appear upon earth, and was conversant with men.
BAR.4.1	This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endures forever: all those who hold it fast 
BAR.4.2	Turn you, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk towards her shining in the presence of the light thereof. 
BAR.4.3	Give not your glory to another, nor the things that are profitable to you to a strange nation. 
BAR.4.4	O Israel, happy are we: for the things that are pleasing to God are made known to us. 
BAR.4.5	Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel. 
BAR.4.6	You° were sold to the nations, 
BAR.4.7	For you° provoked him that made you by sacrificing to demons, and not to God. 
BAR.4.8	You° forgot the everlasting God, that brought you up; you° grieved also Jerusalem, that nursed you. 
BAR.4.9	For she saw the wrath that is come upon you from God, and said, Listen, you° 
BAR.4.10	for I have seen the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting has brought upon them. 
BAR.4.11	For with joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning. 
BAR.4.12	Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many: for the sins of my children am I left desolate; because they turned away from the law of God, 
BAR.4.13	and had no regard to his statutes, neither walked they in the ways of God’s commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness. 
BAR.4.14	Let those who dwell about Sion come, and remember you° the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting has brought upon them. 
BAR.4.15	For he has brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language,
BAR.4.16	And they have carried away the dear beloved sons of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate of her daughters. 
BAR.4.17	But I, what can I help you? 
BAR.4.18	For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hand of your enemies. 
BAR.4.19	Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate. 
BAR.4.20	I have put off the garment of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my petition: I will cry to the Everlasting as long as I live. 
BAR.4.21	Be of good cheer, O my children, cry to God, and he shall deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies. 
BAR.4.22	For I have trusted in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come to me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come to you from your Everlasting Saviour. 
BAR.4.23	For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness forever. 
BAR.4.24	For like as now those who dwell about Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from
BAR.4.25	My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for your enemy has persecuted you; but shortly you shall see his destruction, and shall tread upon their necks. 
BAR.4.26	My delicate ones have gone rough ways; they were taken away as a flock carried off by the enemies. 
BAR.4.27	Be of good cheer, O my children, and cry to God: for you° shall be remembered of him that has brought 
BAR.4.28	For as it was your mind to go astray from God: 
BAR.4.29	For he that brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy again with your salvation. 
BAR.4.30	Be of good cheer, O Jerusalem: for he that called you by name will comfort you. 
BAR.4.31	Miserable are those who afflicted you, and rejoiced at your fall. 
BAR.4.32	Miserable are the cities which your children served: miserable is she that received your sons. 
BAR.4.33	For as she rejoiced at your fall, and was glad of your ruin: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation. 
BAR.4.34	And I will take away her exultation in her great multitude, and her boasting shall be turned into mourning. 
BAR.4.35	For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of
BAR.4.36	O Jerusalem, look about you towards the east, and behold the joy that comes to you from God. 
BAR.4.37	Behold, your sons come, whom you sent away, they come gathered together from the east to the west at the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God.
BAR.5.1	Put off, O Jerusalem, the garment of your mourning and affliction, and put on the beauty of the glory that 
BAR.5.2	Cast about you the robe of the righteousness which 
BAR.5.3	For God will show your brightness to every 
BAR.5.4	For your name shall be called of God forever The peace of righteousness, and The glory of godliness. 
BAR.5.5	Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand upon the height, and look about you towards the east, and behold your children gathered from the going down of the sun to the rising thereof at the word of the Holy One, rejoicing that God has remembered them. 
BAR.5.6	For they went from you on foot, being led away of their enemies: but God brings them in to you borne on high with glory,
BAR.5.7	For God has appointed that every high mountain, and the everlasting hills, should be made low, and the valleys filled up, to make plain the ground, that Israel may go safely in the glory of God. 
BAR.5.8	Moreover the woods and every sweet smelling tree have overshadowed Israel by the commandment of God. 
BAR.5.9	For God shall lead Israel with joy in the light of his glory with the mercy and righteousness that comes from him.
BAR.6.1	A copy of a letter, which Jeremy sent to them which were to be led captives into Babylon by the king of the Babylonians, to certify them, as it was commanded him of God.
BAR.6.2	Because of the sins which you° have committed before God, you° shall be led away captives to Babylon by Nabuchodonosor king of the Babylonians. 
BAR.6.3	So when you° come to Babylon, you° shall remain there many years, and for a long season, even for seven generations: and after that I will bring you out peaceably from thence. 
BAR.6.4	But now shall you° see in Babylon gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood, borne upon shoulders, which cause the nations to fear. 
BAR.6.5	Beware therefore that you° in no wise become like to the strangers, neither let fear take hold upon you because of them, when you° see the multitude before them and behind them, worshipping them. 
BAR.6.6	But say you° in your hearts, O Lord, we must worship you. 
BAR.6.7	For my angel is with you,
BAR.6.8	For their tongue is polished by the workman, and they themselves are overlaid with gold and with silver; yet are they but false, and can’t speak. 
BAR.6.9	And taking gold, as it were for a virgin that loves to be happy, they make crowns for the heads of their gods: 
BAR.6.10	and sometimes also the priests convey from their gods gold and silver, and bestow it upon themselves; 
BAR.6.11	and will even give thereof to the common prostitutes: and they deck them as men with garments, 
BAR.6.12	Yet can’t these gods save themselves from rust and moths, though they be covered with purple raiment. 
BAR.6.13	They wipe their faces because of the dust of the temple, which is thick upon them. 
BAR.6.14	And he that can’t put to death one that offends against him holds a sceptre, as though he were judge of a country. 
BAR.6.15	He has also a dagger in his right hand, and an axe: but can’t deliver himself from war and robbers. 
BAR.6.16	Whereby they are known not to be gods: therefore fear them not. 
BAR.6.17	For like as a vessel that a man uses is nothing worth when it is broken; even so it is with their gods: when they be set up in the temples their eyes be full of dust through the feet of those who come in. 
BAR.6.18	And as the courts are made sure on every side upon him that offends the king, as being committed to suffer death; 
BAR.6.19	They light them candles, yes, more than for themselves, whereof they can’t see one. 
BAR.6.20	They are as one of the beams of the temple; and men say their hearts are eaten out, when things creeping out of the earth devour both them and their raiment: they feel it not 
BAR.6.21	when their faces are blackened through the smoke that comes out of the temple: 
BAR.6.22	bats, swallows, and birds land on their bodies and heads; and in like manner the cats also. 
BAR.6.23	Whereby you° may know that they are no gods: therefore fear them not. 
BAR.6.24	Notwithstanding the gold wherewith they are beset to make them beautiful, except one wipe off the rust, they will not shine: for not even when they were molten did they feel it. 
BAR.6.25	Things wherein there is no breath are bought at any cost. 
BAR.6.26	Having no feet, they are borne upon shoulders, whereby they declare to men that they be nothing worth. 
BAR.6.27	They also that serve them are ashamed: for if they fall to the ground at any time, they can’t rise up again of themselves: neither, if they are bowed down, can they make themselves straight: but the offerings are set before them, as if they were dead men. 
BAR.6.28	And the things that are sacrificed to them, their priests sell and spend; and in like manner their wives also lay up part thereof in salt; but to the poor and to the impotent they will give nothing thereof. 
BAR.6.29	The menstruous woman and the woman in childbed touch their sacrifices: knowing therefore by these things that they are no gods, fear them not. 
BAR.6.30	For how can they be called gods? because women set meat before the gods of silver, gold, and wood. 
BAR.6.31	And in their temples the priests
BAR.6.32	They roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead. 
BAR.6.33	The priests also take off garments from them, and clothe their wives and children withal. 
BAR.6.34	Whether it be evil that one does to them, or good, they are not able to recompense it: they can neither set up a king, nor put him down. 
BAR.6.35	In like manner, they can neither give riches nor money: though a man make a vow to them, and keep it not, they will never exact it. 
BAR.6.36	They can save no man from death, neither deliver the weak from the mighty. 
BAR.6.37	They can’t restore a blind man to his sight, nor deliver any that is in distress. 
BAR.6.38	They can show no mercy to the widow, nor do good to the fatherless. 
BAR.6.39	They are like the stones that be 
BAR.6.40	How should a man then think or say that they are gods, when even the Chaldeans themselves dishonour them? 
BAR.6.41	Who if they shall see one mute that can’t speak, they bring him, and entreat him to call upon Bel, as though he were able to understand. 
BAR.6.42	Yet they can’t perceive this themselves, and forsake them: for they have no understanding. 
BAR.6.43	The women also with cords about them sit in the ways, burning bran for incense: but if any of them, drawn by some that passes by, lie with him, she reproaches her fellow, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken. 
BAR.6.44	Whatsoever is done amongst them is false: how should a man then think or say that they are gods? 
BAR.6.45	They are fashioned by carpenters and goldsmiths: they can be nothing else than the workmen will have them to be. 
BAR.6.46	And they themselves that fashioned them can never continue long; how then should the things that are fashioned by them? 
BAR.6.47	For they have left lies and reproaches to those who come after. 
BAR.6.48	For when there comes any war or plague upon them, the priests consult with themselves, where they may be hidden with them. 
BAR.6.49	How then can’t men understand that they be no gods, which can neither save themselves from war, nor from plague? 
BAR.6.50	For seeing they be but of wood, and overlaid with gold and with silver, it shall be known hereafter that they are false: 
BAR.6.51	and it shall be manifest to all nations and kings that they are no gods, but the works of men’s hands, and that there is no work of God in them. 
BAR.6.52	Who then may not know that they are no gods? 
BAR.6.53	For neither can they set up a king in a land, nor give rain to men. 
BAR.6.54	Neither can they judge their own cause, nor
BAR.6.55	For even when fire falls upon the house of gods of wood, or overlaid with gold or with silver, their priests will flee away, and escape, but they themselves shall be burnt apart like beams. 
BAR.6.56	Moreover they can’t withstand any king or enemies: how should a man then allow or think that they be gods? 
BAR.6.57	Neither are those gods of wood, and overlaid with silver or with gold, able to escape either from thieves or robbers. 
BAR.6.58	Whose gold, and silver, and garments wherewith they are clothed, they that are strong will take from them, and go away withal: neither shall they be able to help themselves. 
BAR.6.59	Therefore it is better to be a king that shows his manhood, or else a vessel in a house profitable for that whereof the owner shall have need, than such false gods; or even a door in a house, to keep the things safe that be therein, than such false gods; or a pillar of wood in a palace, than such false gods. 
BAR.6.60	For sun, and moon, and stars, being bright and sent to do their offices, are obedient. 
BAR.6.61	Likewise also the lightning when it glitters is fair to see; and after the same manner the wind also blows in every country. 
BAR.6.62	And when God commands the clouds to go over the whole world, they do as they are told. 
BAR.6.63	And the fire sent from above to consume mountains and woods does as it is commanded: but these are to be likened to them neither in show nor power. 
BAR.6.64	Wherefore a man should neither think nor say that they are gods, seeing they are able neither to judge causes, nor to do good to men. 
BAR.6.65	Knowing therefore that they are no gods, fear them not. 
BAR.6.66	For they can neither curse nor bless kings: 
BAR.6.67	neither can they show signs in the heavens amongst the nations, nor shine as the sun, nor give light as the moon. 
BAR.6.68	The beasts are better than they: for they can get under a covert, and help themselves. 
BAR.6.69	In no wise then is it manifest to us that they are gods: therefore fear them not. 
BAR.6.70	For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers that keeps nothing, so are their gods of wood, and overlaid with gold and with silver. 
BAR.6.71	Likewise also their gods of wood, and overlaid with gold and with silver, are like to a white thorn in an orchard, that every bird sits upon; as also to a dead body, that is cast forth into the dark. 
BAR.6.72	And you° shall know them to be no gods by the
BAR.6.73	Better therefore is the just man that has none idols: for he shall be far from reproach.
1MA.1.1	It came to pass, after that Alexander the Macedonian, the son of Philip, who came out of the land of Chittim, and struck Darius king of the Persians and Medes, 
1MA.1.2	And he fought many battles, and won many strongholds, and killed the kings of the earth, 
1MA.1.3	and went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils of a multitude of nations. And the earth was quiet before him, and he was exalted, and his heart was lifted up, 
1MA.1.4	and he gathered together an exceedingly strong army, and ruled over countries and nations and principalities, and they became tributary to him. 
1MA.1.5	And after these things he fell sick, and perceived that he should die. 
1MA.1.6	And he called his servants, which were honourable, which had been brought up with him from his youth, and he divided to them his kingdom, while he was yet alive. 
1MA.1.7	And Alexander reigned twelve years, and he died. 
1MA.1.8	And his servants bare rule, each one in his place. 
1MA.1.9	And they did all put diadems upon themselves after that he was dead, and so did their sons after them many years: and they multiplied evils in the earth.
1MA.1.10	And there came forth out of them a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been a hostage at Rome, and he reigned in
1MA.1.11	In those days came there forth out of Israel transgressors of the law, and persuaded many, saying, let’s go and make a covenant with the
1MA.1.12	And the saying was good in their eyes. 
1MA.1.13	And certain of the people were forward 
1MA.1.14	And
1MA.1.15	and they made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the
1MA.1.16	And the kingdom was well ordered in the sight of Antiochus, and he thought to reign over Egypt, that he might reign over the two kingdoms. 
1MA.1.17	And he entered into Egypt with a
1MA.1.18	and he made war against Ptolemy king of Egypt; and Ptolemy was put to shame before him, and fled; and many fell wounded to death. 
1MA.1.19	And they got possession of the strong cities in the land of Egypt; and he took the spoils of Egypt.
1MA.1.20	And Antiochus, after he had struck Egypt, returned in
1MA.1.21	and entered presumptuously into the sanctuary, and took the golden altar, and the candlestick of the light, and all that pertained thereto, 
1MA.1.22	and the table of the show bread, and the cups to pour withal, and the bowls, and the golden censers, and the veil, and the crowns, and the adorning of gold which was on the face of the temple, and he peeled it all off. 
1MA.1.23	And he took the silver and the gold and the precious vessels; and he took the hidden treasures which he found. 
1MA.1.24	And when he had taken all, he went away into his own land, and he made a great slaughter, and spoke very presumptuously. 
1MA.1.25	And there came great mourning upon Israel, in every place where they were; 
1MA.1.26	and the rulers and elders groaned, the virgins and young men were made feeble, and the beauty of the women was changed. 
1MA.1.27	Every bridegroom took up lamentation, she that sat in the marriage chamber was in heaviness. 
1MA.1.28	And the land was moved for the inhabitants thereof, and all the house of Jacob was clothed with shame.
1MA.1.29	And
1MA.1.30	And he spoke words of peace to them in subtlety, and they gave him credence: and he fell upon the city suddenly, and struck it very sore, and destroyed much people out of Israel. 
1MA.1.31	And he took the spoils of the city, and set it on fire, and pulled down the houses thereof and the walls thereof on every side. 
1MA.1.32	And they led captive the women and the children, and the cattle they took in possession. 
1MA.1.33	And they built the city of David with a great and strong wall, with strong towers, and it became to them a citadel. 
1MA.1.34	And they put there a sinful nation, transgressors of the law, and they strengthened themselves therein. 
1MA.1.35	And they stored up arms and food, and gathering together the spoils of Jerusalem, they laid them up there, and they became a sore snare: 
1MA.1.36	and it became a place to lie in wait in against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel continually. 
1MA.1.37	And they shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled the sanctuary. 
1MA.1.38	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them; and she became a habitation of strangers, and she became strange to those who were born in her, and her children forsook her. 
1MA.1.39	Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness,
1MA.1.40	According to her glory, so was her dishonour multiplied, and her high estate was turned into mourning.
1MA.1.41	And king Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that all should be one people, 
1MA.1.42	and that each should forsake his own laws. And all the nations agreed according to the word of the king; 
1MA.1.43	and many of Israel consented to his worship, and sacrificed to the idols, and profaned the Sabbath. 
1MA.1.44	And the king sent letters by the hand of messengers to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, that they should follow laws strange to the land, 
1MA.1.45	and should forbid whole burnt offerings and sacrifice and drink offerings in the sanctuary; and should profane the Sabbaths and feasts, 
1MA.1.46	and pollute the sanctuary and those who were holy; 
1MA.1.47	that they should build altars, and temples, and shrines for idols, and should sacrifice swine’s flesh and unclean beasts: 
1MA.1.48	and that they should leave their sons uncircumcised, that they should make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation; 
1MA.1.49	so that they might forget the law, and change all the ordinances. 
1MA.1.50	And whoever shall not do according to the word of the king, he shall die. 
1MA.1.51	According to all these words wrote he to his whole kingdom; and he appointed overseers over all the people, and he commanded the cities of Judah to sacrifice, city by city. 
1MA.1.52	And from the people were gathered together to them many, every one that had forsaken the law; and they did evil things in the land; 
1MA.1.53	and they made israel to hide themselves in every place of refuge which they had.
1MA.1.54	And on the fifteenth day of Chislev, in
1MA.1.55	And at the doors of the houses and in the streets they burnt incense. 
1MA.1.56	And they tore in pieces the books of the law which they found, and set them on fire. 
1MA.1.57	And wherever was found with any a book of the covenant, and if any consented to the law, the king’s sentence delivered him to death. 
1MA.1.58	Thus did they in their might to Israel, to those that were found month by month in the cities. 
1MA.1.59	And on the five and twentieth day of the month they sacrificed upon the 
1MA.1.60	And
1MA.1.61	And they hanged their babes about their necks, and 
1MA.1.62	And many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat unclean things. 
1MA.1.63	And
1MA.1.64	And there came exceedingly great wrath upon Israel.
1MA.2.1	In those days rose up Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem; and he lived at Modin. 
1MA.2.2	And he had five sons,
1MA.2.3	Simon, who was called Thassi; 
1MA.2.4	Judas, who was called Maccabaeus; 
1MA.2.5	Eleazar, who was called Avaran; Jonathan, who was called Apphus.
1MA.2.6	And he saw the blasphemies that were committed in Judah and in Jerusalem, 
1MA.2.7	and he said,
1MA.2.7	Woe is me! wherefore was I born to see the destruction of my people, and the destruction of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it was given into the hand of the enemy, the sanctuary into the hand of aliens? 
1MA.2.8	Her temple is become as a man
1MA.2.9	her vessels of glory are carried away into captivity, her infants are slain in her streets, her young men with the sword of the enemy. 
1MA.2.10	What nation has not inherited her palaces, and gotten possession of her spoils? 
1MA.2.11	her adorning is all taken away; instead of a free woman she is become a bond woman: 
1MA.2.12	and, behold, our holy things and our beauty and our glory are laid waste, and the Gentiles have profaned them. 
1MA.2.13	Wherefore should we live any longer?
1MA.2.14	And Mattathias and his sons tore their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned exceedingly.
1MA.2.15	And the king’s officers, that were enforcing the apostasy, came into the city Modin to sacrifice. 
1MA.2.16	And many of Israel came to them, and Mattathias and his sons were gathered together. 
1MA.2.17	And the king’s officers answered and spoke to Mattathias, saying, You are a ruler and an honourable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and kindred: 
1MA.2.18	now therefore come you first and do the commandment of the king, as all the nations have done, and the men of Judah, and those who remain in Jerusalem: and you and your house shall be in the number of the king’s
1MA.2.19	And Mattathias answered and said with a loud voice, If all the nations that are in the house of the king’s dominion listen to him, to fall away each one from the worship of his fathers, and have made choice to follow his commandments, 
1MA.2.20	yet I and my sons and my kindred will walk in the covenant of our fathers. 
1MA.2.21	 Heaven forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances. 
1MA.2.22	We will not listen to the king’s words, to go aside from our worship, on the right hand, or on the left. 
1MA.2.23	And when he had left speaking these words, there came a Jew in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which was at Modin, according to the king’s commandment. 
1MA.2.24	And Mattathias saw it, and his zeal was kindled, and his reins trembled, and he showed forth his wrath according to judgement, and ran, and killed him upon the altar. 
1MA.2.25	And the king’s officer, who compelled men to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and pulled down the altar. 
1MA.2.26	And he was zealous for the law, even as Phinehas did to Zimri the son of Salu. 
1MA.2.27	And Mattathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying, Whosoever is zealous for the law, and maintains the covenant, let him come forth after me. 
1MA.2.28	And he and his sons fled into the mountains, and forsook all that they had in the city.
1MA.2.29	Then many that sought after justice and judgement went down into the wilderness, to dwell there, 
1MA.2.30	they, and their sons, and their wives, and their cattle; because evils were multiplied upon them. 
1MA.2.31	And it was told the king’s officers, and the forces that were in Jerusalem, the city of David, that certain men, who had broken the king’s commandment, were gone down into the secret places in the wilderness; 
1MA.2.32	and many pursued after them, and having overtaken them, they encamped against them, and set the battle in array against them on the Sabbath day. 
1MA.2.33	And they said to them, Thus far. Come forth, and do according to the word of the king, and you° shall live. 
1MA.2.34	And they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do the word of the king, to profane the Sabbath day. 
1MA.2.35	And they hurried to give them battle. 
1MA.2.36	And they answered them not, neither cast they a stone at them, nor stopped up the secret places, 
1MA.2.37	saying, Let us die all in our innocency: heaven and earth witness over us, that you° put us to death without trial. 
1MA.2.38	And they rose up against them in battle on the Sabbath, and they died, they and their wives and their children, and their cattle, to the number of a thousand
1MA.2.39	And Mattathias and his friends knew it, and they mourned over them exceedingly. 
1MA.2.40	And one said to another, If we all do as our kindred have done, and fight not against the Gentiles for our lives and our ordinances, they will now quickly destroy us from off the earth. 
1MA.2.41	And they took counsel on that day, saying, whoever shall come against us to battle on the Sabbath day, let’s fight against him, and we shall in no wise all die, as our kindred died in the secret places. 
1MA.2.42	Then were gathered together to them a company of
1MA.2.43	And all those who fled from the evils were added to them, and became a stay to them. 
1MA.2.44	And they mustered an army, and struck sinners in their anger, and lawless men in their wrath: and the rest fled to the Gentiles for safety. 
1MA.2.45	And Mattathias and his friends went round about, and pulled down the altars; 
1MA.2.46	and they circumcised by force the children that were uncircumcised, as many as they found in the coasts of Israel. 
1MA.2.47	And they pursued after the sons of pride, and the work prospered in their hand. 
1MA.2.48	And they rescued the law out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hand of the kings, neither
1MA.2.49	And the days of Mattathias drew near that he should die, and he said to his sons,
1MA.2.49	Now have pride and rebuke gotten strength, and a season of overthrow, and wrath of indignation. 
1MA.2.50	And now, my children, be you° zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers. 
1MA.2.51	And call to remembrance the deeds of our fathers which they did in their generations; and receive great glory and an everlasting name. 
1MA.2.52	Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness? 
1MA.2.53	Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment, and became lord of Egypt. 
1MA.2.54	Phinehas our father, for that he was zealous exceedingly, obtained the covenant of an everlasting priesthood. 
1MA.2.55	Joshua for fulfilling the word became a judge in Israel. 
1MA.2.56	Caleb for bearing witness in the congregation obtained a heritage in the land. 
1MA.2.57	David for being merciful inherited the throne of a kingdom forever and ever. 
1MA.2.58	Elijah, for that he was exceedingly zealous for the law, was taken up into heaven. 
1MA.2.59	Hananiah, Azariah, Mishael, believed, and were saved out of the flame. 
1MA.2.60	Daniel for his innocency was delivered from the mouth of lions. 
1MA.2.61	And thus consider you° from generation to generation, that none that put their trust in him shall lack for strength. 
1MA.2.62	And be not afraid of the words of a sinful man; for his glory shall be dung and worms. 
1MA.2.63	To-day he shall be lifted up, and tomorrow he shall in no wise be found, because he is returned to his dust, and his thought is perished. 
1MA.2.64	And you°, my children, be strong, and show yourselves men in behalf of the law; for therein shall you° obtain glory. 
1MA.2.65	And, behold, Simon your brother, I know that he is a man of counsel; give ear to him always: he shall be a father to you. 
1MA.2.66	And Judas Maccabaeus, he has been strong and mighty from his youth: he shall be your captain, and
1MA.2.67	And take you° to you all the doers of the law, and avenge the wrong of your people. 
1MA.2.68	Render a recompense to the Gentiles, and take heed to the commandments of the law. 
1MA.2.69	And he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers. 
1MA.2.70	And he died in
1MA.3.1	And his son Judas, who was called Maccabaeus, rose up in his stead. 
1MA.3.2	And all his kindred helped him, and so did all those who clave to his father, and they fought with gladness the battle of Israel. 
1MA.3.3	And he got his people great glory, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girded his warlike harness about him, and set battles in array, protecting the army with his sword. 
1MA.3.4	And he was like a lion in his deeds, and as a lion’s whelp roaring for prey. 
1MA.3.5	And he pursued the lawless, seeking them out, and he burnt up those that troubled his people. 
1MA.3.6	And the lawless shrunk for fear of him, and all the workers of lawlessness were sore troubled, and salvation prospered in his hand. 
1MA.3.7	And he angered many kings, and made Jacob glad with his acts, and his memorial is blessed forever. 
1MA.3.8	And he went about amongst the cities of Judah, and destroyed the ungodly
1MA.3.9	and he was renowned to the utmost part of the earth, and he gathered together such as were ready to perish.
1MA.3.10	And Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a great army from Samaria, to fight against Israel. 
1MA.3.11	And Judas perceived it, and he went forth to meet him, and struck him, and killed him: and many fell wounded to death, and the rest fled. 
1MA.3.12	And they took their spoils, and Judas took the sword of Apollonius, and therewith he fought all his days.
1MA.3.13	And Seron, the commander of the army of Syria, heard say that Judas had gathered a gathering and a congregation of faithful men with him, and of such as went out to war; 
1MA.3.14	And he said, I will make myself a name and get me glory in the kingdom; and I will fight against Judas and those who are with him, that set at nothing the word of the king. 
1MA.3.15	And there went up with him also a mighty army of the ungodly to help him, to take vengeance on the children of Israel.
1MA.3.16	And he came near to the going up of Bethhoron, and Judas went forth to meet him with a small company. 
1MA.3.17	But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to Judas, What? shall we be able, being a small company, to fight against so great and strong a multitude? and we for our part are faint, having tasted no food this day. 
1MA.3.18	And Judas said, It is an easy thing for many to be shut up in the hands of a few; and with
1MA.3.19	for victory in battle stands not in the multitude of an army; but strength is from heaven. 
1MA.3.20	They come to us in fullness of insolence and lawlessness, to destroy us and our wives and our children, for to plunder us: 
1MA.3.21	but we fight for our lives and our laws. 
1MA.3.22	And he himself will discomfit them before our face: but as for you, be you° not afraid of them.
1MA.3.23	Now when he had left off speaking, he leapt suddenly upon them, and Seron and his army were discomfited before him. 
1MA.3.24	And they pursued them in the going down of Bethhoron to the plain, and there fell of them about eight hundred men; but the residue fled into the land of the Philistines.
1MA.3.25	And the fear of Judas and his kindred, and the dread of them, began to fall upon the nations round about them: 
1MA.3.26	and his name came near even to the king, and every nation told of the battles of Judas.
1MA.3.27	But when king Antiochus heard these words, he was full of indignation: and he sent and gathered together all the forces of his realm, an exceedingly strong army. 
1MA.3.28	And he opened his treasury, and gave his forces pay for a year, and commanded them to be ready for every need. 
1MA.3.29	And he saw that the money failed from his treasures, and that the tributes of the country were small, because of the dissension and plague which he had brought upon the land, to the end that he might take away the laws which had been from the first days; 
1MA.3.30	and he feared that he should not have enough as at other times for the charges and the gifts which he gave aforetime with a liberal hand, and he abounded above the kings that were before him. 
1MA.3.31	And he was exceedingly perplexed in his mind, and he determined to go into Persia, and to take the tributes of the countries, and to gather much money. 
1MA.3.32	And he left Lysias, an honourable man, and one of the seed royal, to be over the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, 
1MA.3.33	and to bring up his son Antiochus, until he came again. 
1MA.3.34	And he delivered to him the half of his forces, and the elephants, and gave him charge of all the things that he would have done, and concerning those who lived in Judea and in Jerusalem, 
1MA.3.35	that he should send an army against them, to root out and destroy the strength of Israel, and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away their memorial from the place; 
1MA.3.36	And that he should make strangers to dwell on all their coasts, and should divide their land to them by lot. 
1MA.3.37	And the king took the half that remained of the forces, and removed from Antioch, from his royal city,
1MA.3.38	And Lysias chose Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king’s
1MA.3.39	and with them he sent forty thousand footmen, and seven thousand horse, to go into the land of Judah, and to destroy it, according to the word of the king. 
1MA.3.40	And they removed with all their army, and came and pitched near to Emmaus in the plain country. 
1MA.3.41	And the merchants of the country heard the fame of them, and took silver and gold exceedingly much, with
1MA.3.42	And Judas and his kindred saw that evils were multiplied, and that the forces were encamping in their borders; and they took knowledge of the king’s words which he had commanded, to destroy the people and make an end of them; 
1MA.3.43	and they said each man to his neighbour, Let’s raise up the ruin of our people, and let’s fight for our people and the holy place. 
1MA.3.44	And the congregation was gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask for mercy and compassion. 
1MA.3.45	And Jerusalem was without inhabitant as a wilderness, there was none of her offspring that went in or went out; and the sanctuary was trodden down, and the sons of strangers were in the citadel, the Gentiles lodged therein; and joy was taken away from Jacob, and the pipe and the harp ceased. 
1MA.3.46	And they gathered themselves together, and came to Mizpeh, near Jerusalem; for in Mizpeh was there a place of prayer aforetime for Israel. 
1MA.3.47	And they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and 
1MA.3.48	and laid open the book of the law, concerning which the Gentiles were wont to enquire, seeking the likenesses of their idols. 
1MA.3.49	And they brought the priests’ garments, and the first fruits, and the tithes: and they stirred up the Nazarites, who had accomplished their days. 
1MA.3.50	And they cried aloud towards heaven, saying, What shall we do with these men, and where shall we carry them away? 
1MA.3.51	And your holy place is trodden down and profaned, and your priests are in heaviness and brought low. 
1MA.3.52	And, behold, the Gentiles are assembled together against us to destroy us: you know what things they imagine against us. 
1MA.3.53	How shall we be able to stand before them, except you be our help? 
1MA.3.54	And they sounded with the trumpets, and cried with a loud voice.
1MA.3.55	And after this Judas appointed leaders of the people, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens. 
1MA.3.56	And he said to those who were building houses, and were betrothing wives, and were planting vineyards, and were fearful, that they should return, each man to his own house, according to the law. 
1MA.3.57	And the army removed, and encamped upon the south side of Emmaus. 
1MA.3.58	And Judas said, Gird yourselves, and be valiant men, and be in readiness against the morning, that you° may fight with these Gentiles, that are assembled together against us to destroy us, and our holy place: 
1MA.3.59	for it is better for us to die in battle, than to look upon the evils of our nation and the holy place. 
1MA.3.60	Nevertheless, as may be the will in heaven, so shall he do.
1MA.4.1	And Gorgias took five thousand footmen, and a thousand chosen horse, and the army removed by night, 
1MA.4.2	that it might fall upon the army of the Jews and strike them suddenly: and the men of the citadel were his guides. 
1MA.4.3	And Judas heard thereof, and removed, he and the valiant men, that he might strike the king’s army which was at Emmaus, 
1MA.4.4	while as yet the forces were dispersed from the camp. 
1MA.4.5	And Gorgias came into the camp of Judas by night, and found no man; and he sought them in the mountains; for he said, These men flee from us. 
1MA.4.6	And as soon as it was day, Judas appeared in the plain with three thousand men: however they didn’t have the armour and swords they desired. 
1MA.4.7	And they saw the camp of the Gentiles strong 
1MA.4.8	And Judas said to the men that were with him, Fear you° not their multitude, neither be you° afraid of their onset. 
1MA.4.9	Remember how our fathers were saved in the Red sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an army. 
1MA.4.10	And now let’s cry to heaven, if he will have us, and will remember the covenant of our fathers, and destroy this army before our face today: 
1MA.4.11	and all the Gentiles shall know that there is one who redeems and saves Israel. 
1MA.4.12	And the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming near them: 
1MA.4.13	and they went out of the camp to battle. And those who were with Judas sounded their trumpets, 
1MA.4.14	and joined battle, and the Gentiles were discomfited, and fled into the plain. 
1MA.4.15	But all the hindmost fell by the sword: and they pursued them to
1MA.4.16	And Judas and his army returned from pursuing after them, 
1MA.4.17	and he said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoils, inasmuch as there is a battle before us; 
1MA.4.18	and Gorgias and his army are near to us in the mountain. But stand you° now against our enemies, and fight against them, and afterwards take the spoils with boldness. 
1MA.4.19	While Judas was yet making an end of these words, there appeared a part of them looking out from the mountain: 
1MA.4.20	and they saw that their army had been put to flight, and that the Jews were burning the camp; for the smoke that was seen declared what was done. 
1MA.4.21	But when they perceived these things, they were sore afraid; and perceiving also the army of Judas in the plain ready for battle, 
1MA.4.22	they fled all of them into the land of the
1MA.4.23	And Judas returned to plunder the camp, and they got much gold, and silver, and blue, and sea purple, and great riches. 
1MA.4.24	And they returned home, and sang a song of thanksgiving, and gave praise
1MA.4.25	And Israel had a great deliverance that day.
1MA.4.26	But the strangers, as many as had escaped, came and told Lysias all the things that had happened: 
1MA.4.27	but when he heard thereof, he was confounded and discouraged, because neither had such things as he desired been done to Israel, nor had such things as the king commanded him come to pass.
1MA.4.28	And in the next year he gathered together threescore thousand chosen footmen, and five thousand horse, that he might subdue them. 
1MA.4.29	And they came into Idumaea, and encamped at Bethsura; and Judas met them with ten thousand men. 
1MA.4.30	And he saw that the army was strong, and he prayed and said,
1MA.4.30	Blessed are you, O Saviour of Israel, who did quell the onset of the mighty man by the hand of your servant David, and did deliver the army of the
1MA.4.31	shut up this army in the hand of your people Israel, and let them be ashamed for their army and their horsemen: 
1MA.4.32	give them faintness of heart, and cause the boldness of their strength to melt away, and let them quake at their destruction: 
1MA.4.33	cast them down with the sword of those who love you, and let all that know your name praise you with thanksgiving.
1MA.4.34	And they joined battle; and there fell of the army of Lysias about five thousand men, and they fell down near them. 
1MA.4.35	But when Lysias saw that his array was put to flight, and the boldness that had come upon those who were with Judas, and how they were ready either to live or to die nobly, he removed to Antioch, and gathered together hired soldiers, that he might come again into Judea with even a greater company.
1MA.4.36	But Judas and his kindred said, Behold, our enemies are discomfited: let’s go up to cleanse the holy place, and to dedicate it afresh. 
1MA.4.37	And all the army was gathered together, and they went up to mount Sion. 
1MA.4.38	And they saw the sanctuary laid desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burnt up, and shrubs growing in the courts as in a forest or as on one of the mountains, and the priests’ chambers pulled down; 
1MA.4.39	and they tore their clothes, and made great lamentation, and put ashes upon their heads, 
1MA.4.40	and fell on their faces to the ground, and
1MA.4.41	Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those that were in the citadel, until he should have cleansed the holy place.
1MA.4.42	And he chose blameless priests, such as had pleasure in the law: 
1MA.4.43	and they cleansed the holy place, and bare out the stones of defilement into an unclean place. 
1MA.4.44	And they took counsel concerning the altar of burnt offerings, which had been profaned, what they should do with it: 
1MA.4.45	and there came into their mind a good counsel, that they should pull it down, lest it should be a reproach to them, because the Gentiles had defiled it: and they pulled down the altar, 
1MA.4.46	and laid up the stones in the mountain of the house in a convenient place, until there should come a prophet to give an answer concerning them. 
1MA.4.47	And they took whole stones according to the law, and built a new altar after the fashion of the former; 
1MA.4.48	and they built the holy place, and the inner parts of the house; and they hallowed the courts. 
1MA.4.49	And they made the holy vessels new, and they brought the candlestick, and the altar of burnt offerings and of incense, and the table, into the temple. 
1MA.4.50	And they burnt incense upon the altar, and they lighted the lamps that were upon the candlestick, and they gave light in the temple. 
1MA.4.51	And they set loaves upon the table, and spread out the veils, and finished all the works which they made.
1MA.4.52	And they rose up early in the morning, on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, which is the month Chislev, in
1MA.4.53	and offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altar of burnt offerings which they had made. 
1MA.4.54	At what time and on what day the Gentiles had profaned it, even on that 
1MA.4.55	And all the people fell upon their faces, and worshipped, and
1MA.4.56	And they kept the dedication of the altar eight days, and offered burnt offerings with gladness, and sacrificed a sacrifice of deliverance and praise. 
1MA.4.57	And they decked the forefront of the temple with crowns of gold and small shields, and dedicated afresh the gates and the priests’ chambers, and made doors for them. 
1MA.4.58	And there was exceedingly great gladness amongst the people, and the reproach of the Gentiles was turned away. 
1MA.4.59	And Judas and his kindred and the whole congregation of Israel ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altar should be kept in their seasons from year to year by the space of eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month Chislev, with gladness and joy. 
1MA.4.60	And at that season they built up the mount Sion with high walls and strong towers round about, lest perhaps the Gentiles should come and tread them down, as they had done aforetime. 
1MA.4.61	And he set there a force to keep it, and they fortified Bethsura to keep it; that the people might have a stronghold near Idumaea.
1MA.5.1	And it came to pass, when the Gentiles round about heard that the altar was built, and the sanctuary dedicated as aforetime, they were exceedingly angry. 
1MA.5.2	And they took counsel to destroy the race of Jacob that was in the midst of them, and they began to kill and destroy amongst the people. 
1MA.5.3	And Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumaea at Akrabattine, because they besieged Israel: and he struck them with a great slaughter, and brought down their pride, and took their spoils. 
1MA.5.4	And he remembered the wickedness of the children of
1MA.5.5	And they were shut up by him in the towers; and he encamped against them, and destroyed them utterly, and burnt with fire the towers of the place, with all that were therein. 
1MA.5.6	And he passed over to the children of Ammon, and found a mighty band, and much people, with Timotheus for their leader. 
1MA.5.7	And he fought many battles with them, and they were discomfited before his face; and he struck them, 
1MA.5.8	and got possession of Jazer, and the
1MA.5.9	And the Gentiles that were in Gilead gathered themselves together against the Israelites that were on their borders, to destroy them. And they fled to the stronghold of Dathema, 
1MA.5.10	and sent letters to Judas and his kindred, saying, The Gentiles that are round about us are gathered together against us to destroy us: 
1MA.5.11	and they are preparing to come and get possession of the stronghold whereunto we are fled for refuge, and Timotheus is the leader of their army. 
1MA.5.12	Now therefore come and deliver us from their hand, for many of us are fallen. 
1MA.5.13	And all our kindred that were in the land of
1MA.5.14	While the letters were yet reading, behold, there came other messengers from Galilee with their clothes torn, bringing a report after this wise, 
1MA.5.15	saying, That there were gathered together against them those of Ptolemais, and of Tyre, and of Sidon, and all Galilee of the
1MA.5.16	Now when Judas and the people heard these words, there assembled together a great congregation, to consult what they should do for their kindred, that were in suffering, and were assaulted of them. 
1MA.5.17	And Judas said to Simon his brother, Choose you out men, and go and deliver your kindred that are in Galilee, but I and Jonathan my brother will go into the land of Gilead. 
1MA.5.18	And he left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, as leaders of the people, with the remnant of the army, in Judea, for to keep it. 
1MA.5.19	And he gave commandment to them, saying, Take you° the charge of this people, and fight no battle with the Gentiles until that we come again. 
1MA.5.20	And to Simon were divided three thousand men to go into Galilee, but to Judas eight thousand men 
1MA.5.21	And Simon went into Galilee, and fought many battles with the Gentiles, and the Gentiles were discomfited before him. 
1MA.5.22	And he pursued them to the gate of Ptolemais; and there fell of the Gentiles about three thousand men, and he took their spoils. 
1MA.5.23	And they took to them those that were in Galilee, and in Arbatta, with their wives and their children, and all that they had, and brought them into Judea with great gladness. 
1MA.5.24	And Judas Maccabaeus and his brother Jonathan passed over Jordan, and went three days’ journey in the wilderness; 
1MA.5.25	and they met with the Nabathaeans, and these met them in a peaceful manner, and told them all things that had befallen their kindred in the land of Gilead: 
1MA.5.26	and how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor, and Alema,
1MA.5.27	and how that they were shut up in the rest of the cities of the land of Gilead, and that tomorrow they have appointed to encamp against the strongholds, and to take them, and to destroy all these men in one day. 
1MA.5.28	And Judas and his army turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness to Bosora; and he took the city, and killed all the males with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burnt the city with fire. 
1MA.5.29	And he removed from thence by night, and went till he came to the stronghold. 
1MA.5.30	And the morning came, and they lifted up their eyes, and, behold, much people which could not be counted, bearing ladders and engines of war, to take the stronghold; and they were fighting against them. 
1MA.5.31	And Judas saw that the battle was begun, and that the cry of the city went up to heaven, with trumpets and a great sound, 
1MA.5.32	and he said to the men of his army, Fight this day for your kindred. 
1MA.5.33	And he went forth behind them in three companies, and they sounded with their trumpets, and cried out in prayer. 
1MA.5.34	And the army of Timotheus perceived that it was Maccabaeus, and they fled from before him: and he struck them with a great slaughter; and there fell of them on that day about eight thousand men. 
1MA.5.35	And he turned away to Mizpeh and fought against it, and took it, and killed all the males thereof, and took the spoils thereof, and burnt it with fire. 
1MA.5.36	From thence he removed, and took
1MA.5.37	Now after these things Timotheus gathered another army, and encamped near Raphon beyond the brook. 
1MA.5.38	And Judas sent men to spy on the army; and they brought him word, saying, All the Gentiles that are around us are gathered together to them, an exceedingly great army. 
1MA.5.39	And they have hired Arabians to help them, and are encamping beyond the brook, ready to come against you to battle. And Judas went to meet them. 
1MA.5.40	And Timotheus said to the captains of his army, when Judas and his army drew near to the brook of water, If he pass over first to us, we shall not be able to withstand him; for he will mightily prevail against us: 
1MA.5.41	but if he be afraid, and encamp beyond the river, we will cross over to him, and prevail against him. 
1MA.5.42	Now when Judas came near to the brook of water, he caused the scribes of the people to remain by the brook, and gave commandment to them, saying, Suffer no man to encamp, but let all come to the battle. 
1MA.5.43	And he crossed over the first against them, and all the people after him: and all the Gentiles were discomfited before his face, and cast away their arms, and fled to the temple at
1MA.5.44	And they took the city, and burnt the temple with fire, together with all that were therein. And Carnaim was subdued, neither could they stand any longer before the face of Judas.
1MA.5.45	And Judas gathered together all Israel, those who were in the land of Gilead, from the least to the greatest, and their wives, and their children, and their stuff, an exceedingly great army, that they might come into the land of Judah. 
1MA.5.46	And they came as far as Ephron, and this same city was great, 
1MA.5.47	And they of the city shut them out, and stopped up the gates with stones. 
1MA.5.48	And Judas sent to them with words of peace, saying, We will pass through your land to go into our own land, and none shall do you any hurt, we will only pass by on our feet. And they would not open to him. 
1MA.5.49	And Judas commanded proclamation to be made in the army, that each man should encamp in the place where he was. 
1MA.5.50	And the men of the army encamped, and fought against the city all that day and all that night, and the city was delivered into his hands; 
1MA.5.51	and he destroyed all the males with the edge of the sword, and rased the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through the city over those who were slain. 
1MA.5.52	And they went over Jordan into the great plain near Bethshan. 
1MA.5.53	And Judas gathered together those that lagged behind, and encouraged the people all the way through, until he came into the land of Judah. 
1MA.5.54	And they went up to mount Sion with gladness and joy, and offered whole burnt offerings, because not so much as one of them was slain until they returned in peace.
1MA.5.55	And in the days when Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Gilead, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais, 
1MA.5.56	Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, rulers of the army, heard of their exploits and of the war, what things they had done; 
1MA.5.57	and they said, Let’s also get us a name, and let’s go fight against the Gentiles that are around us. 
1MA.5.58	And they gave charge to the men of the army that was with them, and went towards Jamnia. 
1MA.5.59	And Gorgias and his men came out of the city to meet them in battle. 
1MA.5.60	And Joseph and Azarias were put to flight, and were pursued to the borders of Judea; and there fell on that day of the people of Israel about two thousand men. 
1MA.5.61	And there was a great overthrow amongst the people, because they didn’t listen to Judas and his kindred, thinking to do some exploit. 
1MA.5.62	But they were not of the seed of those men, by whose hand deliverance was given to Israel.
1MA.5.63	And the man Judas and his kindred were glorified exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and of all the Gentiles, wherever their name was heard of; 
1MA.5.64	and men gathered together to them, acclaiming them.
1MA.5.65	And Judas and his kindred went forth, and fought against the children of Esau in the land towards the south; and he struck Hebron and the
1MA.5.66	And he removed to go into the land of the
1MA.5.67	In that day certain priests, desiring to do exploits there, were slain in battle, when as
1MA.5.68	And Judas turned towards Azotus, to the land of the
1MA.6.1	And king Antiochus was journeying through the upper countries; and he heard say, that in Elymais in Persia there was a city renowned for riches, for silver and gold; 
1MA.6.2	and that the temple which was in it was rich exceedingly, and that therein were golden shields, and breastplates, and arms, which Alexander, son of Philip, the Macedonian king, who reigned first amongst the Greeks, left behind there. 
1MA.6.3	And he came and sought to take the city, and to pillage it; and he was not able, because the thing was known to them of the city, 
1MA.6.4	and they rose up against him to battle: and he fled, and removed thence with great heaviness, to return to Babylon.
1MA.6.5	And there came one bringing him tidings into Persia, that the armies, which went against the land of Judah, had been put to flight; 
1MA.6.6	and that Lysias went first with a strong army, and was put to shame before them; and that they had waxed strong by reason of arms and power, and with store of spoils, which they took from the armies that they had cut off; 
1MA.6.7	and that they had pulled down the abomination which he had built upon the altar that was in Jerusalem; and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and Bethsura, his city. 
1MA.6.8	And it came to pass, when the king heard these words, he was astonished and moved exceedingly: and he laid him down upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not befallen him as he looked for. 
1MA.6.9	And he was there many days, because great grief was renewed upon him, and he made account that he should die. 
1MA.6.10	And he called for all his
1MA.6.11	And I said in my heart, To what suffering am I come, and how great a flood is it, wherein I now am! for I was gracious and beloved in my power. 
1MA.6.12	But now I remember the evils which I did at Jerusalem, and that I took all the vessels of silver and gold that were therein, and sent forth to destroy the inhabitants of Judah without a cause. 
1MA.6.13	I perceive that on this account these evils are come upon me, and, behold, I perish through great grief in a strange land. 
1MA.6.14	And he called for Philip, one of his
1MA.6.15	and gave him his diadem, and his robe, and his signet ring, to the end he should bring Antiochus his son, and nourish him up that he might be king. 
1MA.6.16	And king Antiochus died there in
1MA.6.17	And Lysias knew that the king was dead, and he set up Antiochus his son to reign, whom he had nourished up being young, and he called his name Eupator.
1MA.6.18	And those who were in the citadel shut up Israel round about the sanctuary, and sought always their hurt, and the strengthening of the Gentiles. 
1MA.6.19	And Judas thought to destroy them, and called all the people together to besiege them. 
1MA.6.20	And they were gathered together, and besieged them in
1MA.6.21	And there came forth some of those who were shut up, and there were joined to them certain ungodly men of Israel. 
1MA.6.22	And they went to the king, and said, How long will you not execute judgement, and avenge our kindred? 
1MA.6.23	We were willing to serve your father, and to walk after his words, and to follow his commandments; 
1MA.6.24	and for this cause the children of our people besieged
1MA.6.25	And not against us only did they stretch out their hand, but also against all their borders. 
1MA.6.26	And, behold, they are encamped this day against the citadel at Jerusalem, to take it: and the sanctuary and Bethsura have they fortified. 
1MA.6.27	And if you° are not beforehand with them quickly, they will do greater things than these, and you shall not be able to control them.
1MA.6.28	And when the king heard this, he was angry, and gathered together all his
1MA.6.29	And there came to him from other kingdoms, and from isles of the sea, bands of hired soldiers. 
1MA.6.30	And the number of his forces was a hundred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and two and thirty elephants trained for war. 
1MA.6.31	And they went through Idumaea, and encamped against Bethsura, and fought against it many days, and made engines of war; and they 
1MA.6.32	And Judas removed from the citadel, and encamped at Bethzacharias, near the king’s camp. 
1MA.6.33	And the king rose early in the morning, and removed his army
1MA.6.34	And they showed the elephants the blood of grapes and mulberries, that they might prepare them for the battle. 
1MA.6.35	And they divided the beasts amongst the phalanxes, and they set by each elephant a thousand men armed with coats of mail, and helmets of brass on their heads; and for each beast were appointed five hundred chosen horsemen. 
1MA.6.36	These were ready beforehand, wherever the beast was; and wherever the beast went, they went with him; they departed not from him. 
1MA.6.37	And towers of wood were upon them, strong 
1MA.6.38	(and the residue of the horsemen he set on this side and that side at the two parts of the army), striking terror 
1MA.6.39	Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the mountains shone therewith, and blazed like torches of fire. 
1MA.6.40	And a part of the king’s army was spread upon the high mountains, and some on the low ground, and they went on firmly and in order. 
1MA.6.41	And all that heard the noise of their multitude, and the marching of the multitude, and the rattling of the arms, did quake: for the army was exceedingly great and strong. 
1MA.6.42	And Judas and his army drew near for battle, and there fell of the king’s army six hundred men. 
1MA.6.43	And Eleazar, who was 
1MA.6.44	and he gave himself to deliver his people, and to get him an everlasting name; 
1MA.6.45	and he ran upon him courageously into the midst of the phalanx, and killed on the right hand and on the left, and they parted asunder from him on this side and on that. 
1MA.6.46	And he crept under the elephant, and thrust him from beneath, and killed him; and 
1MA.6.47	And they saw the strength of the kingdom, and the fierce onset of the army, and turned away from them.
1MA.6.48	But they of the king’s army went up to Jerusalem to meet them, and the king encamped towards Judea, and towards mount Sion. 
1MA.6.49	And he made peace with them of Bethsura; and he came out of the city, because they had no food there to endure the siege, because it was a Sabbath to the land. 
1MA.6.50	And the king took Bethsura, and appointed a garrison there to keep it. 
1MA.6.51	And he encamped against the sanctuary many days; and set there mounds to shoot from, and engines of war, and instruments for casting fire and stones, and pieces to cast darts, and slings. 
1MA.6.52	And they also made engines against their engines, and fought for many days. 
1MA.6.53	But there were no food in the sanctuary, because it was the seventh year, and those who fled for safety into Judea from amongst the Gentiles had eaten up the residue of the store; 
1MA.6.54	and there were but a few left in the sanctuary, because the famine prevailed against them, and they were scattered, each man to his own place.
1MA.6.55	And Lysias heard say, that Philip, whom Antiochus the king, whiles he was yet alive, appointed to nourish up his son Antiochus, that he might be king, 
1MA.6.56	was returned from Persia and Media, and with him the forces that went with the king, and that he was seeking to take to him the government. 
1MA.6.57	And he made haste, and gave consent to depart; and he said to the king and the leaders of the army and to the men, We decay daily, and our food is scant, and the place where we encamp is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom lie upon us: 
1MA.6.58	now therefore let’s give the right hand to these men, and make peace with them and with all their nation, 
1MA.6.59	and covenant with them, that they shall walk after their own laws, as aforetime: for because of their laws which we abolished they were angered, and did all these things. 
1MA.6.60	And the saying pleased the king and the princes, and he sent to them to make peace; and they accepted thereof. 
1MA.6.61	And the king and the princes sware to them: thereupon they came forth from the stronghold. 
1MA.6.62	And the king entered into mount Sion; and he saw the strength of the place, and set at nothing the oath which he had sworn, and gave commandment to pull down the wall round about. 
1MA.6.63	And he removed in haste, and returned to Antioch, and found Philip master of the city; and he fought against him, and took the city by force.
1MA.7.1	In
1MA.7.2	And it came to pass, when he would go into the house of the kingdom of his fathers, that the army laid hands on Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them to him. 
1MA.7.3	And the thing was known to him, and he said, show me not their faces. 
1MA.7.4	And the army killed them. And Demetrius sat upon the throne of his kingdom. 
1MA.7.5	And there came to him all the lawless and ungodly men of Israel; and Alcimus was their leader, desiring to be high priest; 
1MA.7.6	and they accused the people to the king, saying, Judas and his kindred have destroyed all your friends, and have scattered us from our own land. 
1MA.7.7	Now therefore send a man whom you trust, and let him go and see all the havock which he has made of us, and of the king’s country, and 
1MA.7.8	And the king chose Bacchides, one of the king’s
1MA.7.9	And he sent him, and that ungodly Alcimus, and made sure to him the high priesthood, and he commanded him to take vengeance upon the children of Israel.
1MA.7.10	And they removed, and came with a great army into the land of Judah, and he sent messengers to Judas and his kindred with words of peace deceitfully. 
1MA.7.11	And they gave no heed to their words; for they saw that they were come with a great army. 
1MA.7.12	And there were gathered together to Alcimus and Bacchides a company of scribes, to seek for justice. 
1MA.7.13	And the
1MA.7.14	for they said, One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come with the forces, and he will do us no wrong. 
1MA.7.15	And he spoke with them words of peace, and sware to them, saying, We will seek the hurt neither of you nor your friends. 
1MA.7.16	And they gave him credence: and he laid hands on threescore men of them, and killed them in one day, according to the word which 
1MA.7.17	And their blood did they shed round about Jerusalem;
1MA.7.17	And there was no man to bury them.
1MA.7.18	And the fear and the dread of them fell upon all the people, for they said, There is neither truth nor judgement in them; for they have broken the covenant and the oath which they sware. 
1MA.7.19	And Bacchides removed from Jerusalem, and encamped in Bezeth; and he sent and took away many of the deserters that were with him, and certain of the people, and he killed them, 
1MA.7.20	And he made sure the country to Alcimus, and left with him a force to aid him; and Bacchides went away to the king.
1MA.7.21	And Alcimus strove for his high priesthood. 
1MA.7.22	And there were gathered to him all those who troubled their people, and they got the mastery of the land of Judah, and did great hurt in Israel. 
1MA.7.23	And Judas saw all the mischief that Alcimus and his company had done amongst the children of Israel, 
1MA.7.24	and he went out into all the coasts of Judea round about, and took vengeance on the men that had deserted from him, and they were restrained from going forth into the country. 
1MA.7.25	But when Alcimus saw that Judas and his company waxed strong, and knew that he was not able to withstand them, he returned to the king, and brought evil accusations against them.
1MA.7.27	And Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great army; and he sent to Judas and his kindred deceitfully with words of peace, saying, 
1MA.7.28	Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with a few men, that I may see your faces in peace. 
1MA.7.29	And he came to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably. And the enemies were ready to take away Judas by violence. 
1MA.7.30	And the thing was known to Judas, 
1MA.7.31	And Nicanor knew that his counsel was discovered; and he went out to meet Judas in battle beside Capharsalama; 
1MA.7.32	and there fell of Nicanor’s side about
1MA.7.33	And after these things Nicanor went up to mount Sion: and there came some of the priests out of the sanctuary, and some of the elders of the people, to salute him peaceably, and to show him the whole burnt sacrifice that was being offered for the king. 
1MA.7.34	And he mocked them, and laughed at them, and
1MA.7.35	and sware in a rage, saying, Unless Judas and his army be now delivered into my hands, it shall be that, if I come again in peace, I will burn up this house: and he went out in a great rage. 
1MA.7.36	And the priests entered in, and stood before the altar and the temple; and they wept, and said, 
1MA.7.37	You did choose this house to be called by your name, to be a house of prayer and supplication for your people: 
1MA.7.38	take vengeance on this man and his army, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to live any longer.
1MA.7.39	And Nicanor went forth from Jerusalem, and encamped in Bethhoron, and there met him the army of Syria. 
1MA.7.40	And Judas encamped in Adasa with three thousand men: and Judas prayed and said, 
1MA.7.41	When those who came from the king blasphemed, your angel went out, and struck amongst them a hundred and fourscore and five thousand. 
1MA.7.42	Even so discomfit you this army before us today, and let all the rest know that he has spoken wickedly against your sanctuary, and judge you him according to his wickedness. 
1MA.7.43	And on the thirteenth day of the month Adar the armies joined battle: and Nicanor’s army was discomfited, and he himself was the first to fall in the battle. 
1MA.7.44	Now when his army saw that Nicanor was fallen, they cast away their arms, and fled. 
1MA.7.45	And they pursued after them a day’s journey from Adasa until you come to
1MA.7.46	And they came forth out of all the villages of Judea round about, and
1MA.7.47	And they took the spoils, and the booty, and they struck off Nicanor’s head, and his right hand, which he stretched out so haughtily, and brought them, and
1MA.7.48	And the people were exceedingly glad, and they kept that day as a day of great gladness. 
1MA.7.49	And
1MA.7.50	And the land of Judah had rest
1MA.8.1	And Judas heard of the fame of the Romans, that they are valiant men, and have pleasure in all that join themselves to them, and make friends with all such as come to them, 
1MA.8.2	and that they are valiant men. And they told him of their wars and exploits which they do amongst the Gauls, and how that they conquered them, and brought them under tribute; 
1MA.8.3	and what things they did in the land of Spain, that they might become masters of the mines of silver and gold which were there; 
1MA.8.4	and how that by their policy and persistence they conquered all the place (and the place was exceedingly far from them), and the kings that came against them from the uttermost part of the earth, until they had discomfited them, and struck them very sore; and how the rest give them tribute year by year: 
1MA.8.5	and Philip, and Perseus, king of Chittim, and those who lifted up themselves against them, did they discomfit in battle, and conquered them: 
1MA.8.6	Antiochus also, the great king of Asia, who came against them to battle, having a hundred and twenty elephants, with horse, and chariots, and an exceedingly great army, and he was discomfited by them, 
1MA.8.7	and they took him alive, and appointed that both he and such as reigned after him should give them a great tribute, and should give hostages, and a parcel 
1MA.8.8	the country of India, and Media, and Lydia, and of the goodliest of their countries; and they took them from him, and gave them to king Eumenes: 
1MA.8.9	and how they of Greece took counsel to come and destroy them; 
1MA.8.10	and the thing was known to them, and they sent against them a captain, and fought against them, and many of them fell down wounded to death, and they made captive their wives and their children, and plundered them, and conquered their land, and pulled down their strongholds, and plundered them, and brought them into bondage to this day: 
1MA.8.11	and the residue of the kingdoms and of the isles, as many as rose up against them at any time, they destroyed and made them to be their servants; 
1MA.8.12	but with their friends and such as relied upon them they stayed friends; and they conquered the kingdoms that were near and those that were far off, and all that heard of their fame were afraid of them: 
1MA.8.13	moreover, whoever they will to help and to make kings, these do they make kings; and whoever they will, do they depose; and they are exalted exceedingly: 
1MA.8.14	and for all this none of them did ever put on a diadem, neither did they clothe themselves with purple, to be magnified by it: 
1MA.8.15	and how they had made for themselves a senate house, and day by day three hundred and twenty men sat in council, consulting always for the people, to the end they might be well ordered: 
1MA.8.16	and how they commit their government to one man year by year, that he should rule over them, and be lord over all their country, and all are obedient to that one, and there is neither envy nor emulation amongst them.
1MA.8.17	And Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, the son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome, to establish friendship and alliance with them, 
1MA.8.18	and that they should take the yoke from them; for they saw that the kingdom of the Greeks did keep Israel in bondage. 
1MA.8.19	And they went to Rome (and the way was exceedingly long), and they entered into the senate house, and answered and said, 
1MA.8.20	Judas, who is also 
1MA.8.21	And the thing was well-pleasing in their sight. 
1MA.8.22	And this is the copy of the writing which they wrote back again on tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that it might be with them there for a memorial of peace and confederacy:
1MA.8.23	Good success be to the Romans, and to the nation of the Jews, by sea and by land forever: the sword also and the enemy be far from them. 
1MA.8.24	But if war arise for Rome first, or any of their allies in all their dominion, 
1MA.8.25	the nation of the Jews shall help them as allies, as the occasion shall prescribe to them, with all their heart: 
1MA.8.26	and to those who make war upon them they shall not give, neither supply, food, arms, money, or ships, as it has seemed good to Rome, and they shall keep their ordinances without taking anything therefore. 
1MA.8.27	In the same manner, moreover, if war come first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help them as allies with all their soul, as the occasion shall prescribe to them: 
1MA.8.28	and to those who are allies 
1MA.8.29	According to these words have the Romans made a covenant thus with the people of the Jews. 
1MA.8.30	But if hereafter the one party and the other shall take counsel to add or diminish anything, they shall do it at their pleasure, and whatever they shall add or take away shall be established. 
1MA.8.31	And as touching the evils which king Demetrius does to them, we have written to him, saying, Wherefore have you made your yoke heavy upon our friends and allies the Jews? 
1MA.8.32	If therefore they plead any more against you, we will do them justice, and fight with you by sea and by land.
1MA.9.1	And Demetrius heard that Nicanor was fallen with his forces in battle, and he sent Bacchides and Alcimus again into the land of Judah a second time, and the right wing 
1MA.9.2	and they went by the way that leads to Gilgal, and encamped against Mesaloth, which is in Arbela, and got possession of it, and destroyed much people. 
1MA.9.3	And the first month of
1MA.9.4	and they removed, and went to Berea, with twenty thousand footmen and two thousand horse. 
1MA.9.5	And Judas was encamped at Elasa, and three thousand chosen men with him: 
1MA.9.6	and they saw the multitude of the forces, that they were many, and they feared exceedingly: and many slipped away out of the army; there were not left of them more than eight hundred men. 
1MA.9.7	And Judas saw that his army slipped away, and that the battle pressed upon him, and he was sore troubled in heart, for that he had no time to gather them together, and he waxed faint. 
1MA.9.8	And he said to those who were left, Let’s arise and go up against our adversaries, if perhaps we may be able to fight with them. 
1MA.9.9	And they would have dissuaded him, saying, We shall in no wise be able: but let’s rather save our lives now: let’s return again, 
1MA.9.10	And Judas said, let it not be so that I should do this thing, to flee from them: and if our time is come, let’s die in a manly way for our kindred’s sake, and not leave a cause of reproach against our glory. 
1MA.9.11	And the army removed from the camp, and stood to encounter them, and the horse was parted into two companies, and the slingers and the archers went before the army, and all the mighty men that fought in the front of the battle. 
1MA.9.12	But Bacchides was in the right wing; and the phalanx drew near on the two parts, and they blew with their trumpets. 
1MA.9.13	And the men of Judas’ side, even they sounded with their trumpets, and the earth shook with the shout of the armies, and the battle was joined, and continued from morning until evening. 
1MA.9.14	And Judas saw that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right side, and there went with him all that were brave in heart, 
1MA.9.15	and the right wing was discomfited by them, and he pursued after them to the mount Azotus. 
1MA.9.16	And those who were on the left wing saw that the right wing was discomfited, and they turned and followed upon the footsteps of Judas and of those that were with him: 
1MA.9.17	and the battle waxed sore, and many on both parts fell wounded to death. 
1MA.9.18	And Judas fell, and the rest fled. 
1MA.9.19	And Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother, and buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers at Modin. 
1MA.9.20	And they bewailed him, and all Israel made great lamentation for him, and mourned many days, and said, 
1MA.9.21	How is the mighty fallen, the saviour of Israel! 
1MA.9.22	And the rest of the acts of Judas, and his wars, and the valiant deeds which he did, and his greatness, they are not written; for they were exceedingly many.
1MA.9.23	And it came to pass after the death of Judas, that the lawless put forth their heads in all the coasts of Israel, and all those who did iniquity rose up 
1MA.9.24	(in those days there was an exceedingly great famine), and the country went over with them. 
1MA.9.25	And Bacchides chose out the ungodly men, and made them lords of the country. 
1MA.9.26	And they sought out and searched for the friends of Judas, and brought them to Bacchides, and he took vengeance on them, and used them despitefully. 
1MA.9.27	And there was great suffering in Israel, such as was not since the time that no prophet appeared to them. 
1MA.9.28	And all the friends of Judas were gathered together, and they said to Jonathan, 
1MA.9.29	Since your brother Judas has died, we have no man like him to go forth against our enemies and Bacchides, and amongst them of our nation that hate us. 
1MA.9.30	Now therefore we have chosen you this day to be our prince and leader in his stead, that you may fight our battles. 
1MA.9.31	And Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up in the stead of his brother Judas.
1MA.9.32	And Bacchides knew it, and he sought to kill him. 
1MA.9.33	And Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were with him, knew it; and they fled into the wilderness of Tekoah, and encamped by the water of the pool Asphar. 
1MA.9.34	And Bacchides knew it on the Sabbath day, and came, he and all his army, over Jordan. 
1MA.9.35	And 
1MA.9.36	And the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went their way with it.
1MA.9.37	But after these things they brought word to Jonathan and Simon his brother, that the children of Jambri were making a great marriage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabath with a great train, a daughter of one of the great nobles of Canaan. 
1MA.9.38	And they remembered John their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain: 
1MA.9.39	and they lifted up their eyes, and saw, and, behold, a great ado and much baggage: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and his kindred, to meet them with timbrels, and minstrels, and many weapons. 
1MA.9.40	And they rose up against them from their ambush, and killed them, and many fell wounded to death, and the remnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils. 
1MA.9.41	And the marriage was turned into mourning, and the voice of their minstrels into lamentation. 
1MA.9.42	And they avenged fully the blood of their brother, and turned back to the marsh of Jordan.
1MA.9.43	And Bacchides heard it, and he came on the Sabbath day to the banks of Jordan with a great army. 
1MA.9.44	And Jonathan said to his company, Let’s stand up now and fight for our lives, for it is not 
1MA.9.45	For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us; moreover the water of the Jordan is on this side and on that side, and marsh and wood; and there is no place to escape. 
1MA.9.46	Now therefore cry to heaven, that you° may be delivered out of the hand of your enemies. 
1MA.9.47	And the battle was joined, and Jonathan stretched forth his hand to strike Bacchides, and he turned away back from him. 
1MA.9.48	And Jonathan and those who were with him leapt into the Jordan, and swam over to the other side: and they didn’t pass over Jordan against them. 
1MA.9.49	And there fell of Bacchides’ company that day about a thousand men; 
1MA.9.50	and he returned to Jerusalem. And they built strong cities in Judea, the stronghold that was in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Timnath, Pharathon, and Tephon, with high walls and gates and bars. 
1MA.9.51	And in them he set a garrison, to vex Israel. 
1MA.9.52	And he fortified the city Bethsura, and Gazara, and the citadel, and put forces in them, and store of food. 
1MA.9.53	And he took the sons of the chief men of the country for hostages, and put them in ward in the citadel at Jerusalem.
1MA.9.54	And in
1MA.9.55	and he began to pull down. At that time was Alcimus stricken, and his works were hindered; and his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, and he could no more speak anything and give order concerning his house. 
1MA.9.56	And Alcimus died at that time with great torment. 
1MA.9.57	And Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, and he returned to the king: and the land of Judah had rest two years.
1MA.9.58	And all the lawless men took counsel, saying, Behold, Jonathan and they of his part are dwelling at ease, and in security: now therefore we will bring Bacchides, and he shall lay hands on them all in one night. 
1MA.9.59	And they went and consulted with him. 
1MA.9.60	And he removed, and came with a great army, and sent letters privily to all his allies that were in Judea, that they should lay hands on Jonathan and those that were with him: and they could not, because their counsel was known to them. 
1MA.9.61	And 
1MA.9.62	And Jonathan, and Simon, and those who were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and he built up that which had been pulled down thereof, and they made it strong. 
1MA.9.63	And Bacchides knew it, and he gathered together all his multitude, and sent word to those who were of Judea. 
1MA.9.64	And he went and encamped against Bethbasi, and fought against it many days, and made engines of war. 
1MA.9.65	And Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and went forth into the country, and he went with a few men. 
1MA.9.66	And he struck Odomera and his kindred, and the children of Phasiron in their tent. 
1MA.9.67	And they began to strike them, and to go up with their forces. And Simon and those who were with him went out of the city, and set on fire the engines of war, 
1MA.9.68	and fought against Bacchides, and he was discomfited by them, and they afflicted him sore; for his counsel was in vain, and his inroad. 
1MA.9.69	And they were very angry with the lawless men that gave him counsel to come into the country, and they killed many of them. And he took counsel to depart into his own land. 
1MA.9.70	And Jonathan had knowledge thereof, and sent ambassadors to him, to the end that they should make peace with him, and that he should restore to them the captives. 
1MA.9.71	And he accepted the thing, and did according to his words, and sware to him that he would not seek his hurt all the days of his life. 
1MA.9.72	And he restored to him the captives which he had taken aforetime out of the land of Judah, and he returned and departed into his own land, and came not any more into their borders. 
1MA.9.73	And the sword ceased from Israel. And Jonathan lived at Michmash; and Jonathan began to judge the people; and he destroyed the ungodly out of Israel.
1MA.10.1	And in
1MA.10.2	And king Demetrius heard thereof, and he gathered together exceedingly great forces, and went forth to meet him in battle.
1MA.10.3	And Demetrius sent letters to Jonathan with words of peace, so as to magnify him. 
1MA.10.4	For he said, let’s go beforehand to make peace with them, before he makes peace with Alexander against us: 
1MA.10.5	for he will remember all the evils that we have done against him, and to his kindred and to his nation. 
1MA.10.6	And he gave him authority to gather together forces, and to provide arms, and that he should be his ally: and he commanded that they should deliver up to him the hostages that were in the citadel.
1MA.10.7	And Jonathan came to Jerusalem, and read the letters in the audience of all the people, and of those who were in the citadel: 
1MA.10.8	and they were sore afraid, when they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together an army. 
1MA.10.9	And they of the citadel delivered up the hostages to Jonathan, and he restored them to their parents. 
1MA.10.10	And Jonathan lived in Jerusalem, and began to build and renew the city. 
1MA.10.11	And he commanded those who did the work to build the walls and the mount Sion round about with
1MA.10.12	And the strangers, that were in the strongholds which Bacchides had built, fled away; 
1MA.10.13	and each man left his place, and departed into his own land. 
1MA.10.14	Only at Bethsura were there left certain of those that had forsaken the law and the commandments; for it was a place of refuge to them.
1MA.10.15	And king Alexander heard all the promises which Demetrius had sent to Jonathan: and they told him of the battles and the valiant deeds which he and his kindred had done, and of the toils which they had endured; 
1MA.10.16	And he said, Shall we find such another man? and now we will make him our
1MA.10.17	And he wrote letters, and sent them to him, according to these words, saying, 
1MA.10.18	King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greeting: 
1MA.10.19	We have heard of you, that you are a mighty man of valour, and meet to be our
1MA.10.20	And now we have appointed you this day to be high priest of your nation, and to be called the king’s
1MA.10.21	And Jonathan put on the holy garments in the seventh month of
1MA.10.22	And Demetrius heard these things, and he was grieved, and said, 
1MA.10.23	What is this that we have done, that Alexander has been beforehand with us in establishing friendship with the Jews, to strengthen himself? 
1MA.10.24	I also will write to them words of encouragement and of honour and of gifts, that they may be with me to aid me. 
1MA.10.25	And he sent to them according to these words:
1MA.10.25	King Demetrius to the nation of the Jews, greeting: 
1MA.10.26	Forasmuch as you° have kept your covenants with us, and continued in our friendship, and have not joined yourselves to our enemies, we have heard of this, and are glad. 
1MA.10.27	And now continue you° still to keep faith with us, and we will recompense to you good things in return for your dealings with us, 
1MA.10.28	and will grant you many immunities, and give you gifts. 
1MA.10.29	And now do I free you, and release all the Jews, from the tributes, and from the customs of salt, and from the crowns. 
1MA.10.30	And instead of the third part of the seed, and instead of the half of the fruit of the trees, which falls to me to receive, I release it from this day and henceforth, so that I will not take it from the land of Judah, and from the three governments which are added thereto from the country of Samaria and Galilee, from this day forth and for all time. 
1MA.10.31	And let Jerusalem be holy and free, and her borders; the tenths and the tolls 
1MA.10.32	I yield up also my authority over the citadel which is at Jerusalem, and give it to the high priest, that he may appoint in it such men as he shall choose to keep it. 
1MA.10.33	And every soul of the Jews, that has been carried captive from the land of Judah into any part of my kingdom, I set at liberty without price; and let all remit the tributes of their cattle also. 
1MA.10.34	And all the feasts, and the Sabbaths, and new moons, and appointed days, and three days before a feast, and three days after a feast, let them all be days of immunity and release for all the Jews that are in my kingdom. 
1MA.10.35	And no man shall have authority to exact from any of them, or to trouble them concerning any matter. 
1MA.10.36	And let there be enrolled amongst the king’s forces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, and pay shall be given to them, as belongs to all the king’s forces. 
1MA.10.37	And of them some shall be placed in the king’s great strongholds, and some of them shall be placed over the affairs of the kingdom, which are of trust: and let those that are over them, and their rulers, be of themselves, and let them walk after their own laws, even as the king has commanded in the land of Judah. 
1MA.10.38	And the three governments that have been added to Judea from the country of Samaria, let them be added to Judea, that they may be reckoned to be under one, that they may not obey other authority than the high priest’s. 
1MA.10.39	As for Ptolemais, and the land pertaining thereto, I have given it as a gift to the sanctuary that is at Jerusalem, for the expenses that befit the sanctuary. 
1MA.10.40	And I give every year fifteen thousand shekels of silver from the king’s revenues from the places that are convenient. 
1MA.10.41	And all the overplus, which those who manage the king’s affairs paid not in as in the first years, they shall give from henceforth towards the works of the house. 
1MA.10.42	And beside this, the five thousand shekels of silver, which they received from the uses of the sanctuary from the revenue year by year, this also is released, because it appertains to the priests that minister. 
1MA.10.43	And whoever shall flee to the temple that is at Jerusalem, and 
1MA.10.44	And for the building and renewing of the works of the sanctuary the expense shall be given also out of the king’s revenue. 
1MA.10.45	And for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, and the fortifying thereof round about, shall the expense be given also out of the king’s revenue, and for the building of the walls in Judea.
1MA.10.46	Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gave no credence to them, nor received them, because they remembered the great evil which he had done in Israel, and that he had afflicted them very sore. 
1MA.10.47	And they were well pleased with Alexander, because he was the first that spoke words of peace to them, and they were allies with him always. 
1MA.10.48	And king Alexander gathered together great forces, and encamped near Demetrius. 
1MA.10.49	And the two kings joined battle, and the army of Alexander fled; and Demetrius followed after him, and prevailed against them. 
1MA.10.50	And he strengthened the battle exceedingly until the sun went down: and Demetrius fell that day.
1MA.10.51	And Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemy king of Egypt according to these words, saying, 
1MA.10.52	Forasmuch as I am returned to my kingdom, and am set on the throne of my fathers, and have gotten the dominion, and have overthrown Demetrius, and have gotten possession of our country; 
1MA.10.53	yes, I joined the battle with him, and he and his army were discomfited by us, and we sat upon the throne of his kingdom: 
1MA.10.54	now also let’s make friends with one another, and give me now your daughter to wife: and I will be joined with you, and will give both you and her gifts worthy of you. 
1MA.10.55	And Ptolemy the king answered, saying, Happy is the day wherein you did return into the land of your fathers, and did sit on the throne of their kingdom. 
1MA.10.56	And now I will do to you, as you have written: but meet me at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; and I will join with you, even as you have said. 
1MA.10.57	And Ptolemy went out of Egypt, himself and Cleopatra his daughter, and came to Ptolemais in
1MA.10.58	and king Alexander met him, and he bestowed on him his daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her wedding at Ptolemais with great pomp, as the manner of kings is.
1MA.10.59	And king Alexander wrote to Jonathan, that he should come to meet him. 
1MA.10.60	And he went with pomp to Ptolemais, and met the two kings, and gave them and their
1MA.10.61	And there were gathered together against him certain pestilent fellows out of Israel, men that were transgressors of the law, to complain against him: and the king gave no heed to them. 
1MA.10.62	And the king commanded, and they took off Jonathan’s garments, and clothed him in purple: and thus they did. 
1MA.10.63	And the king made him sit with him, and said to his princes, Go forth with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, that no man complain against him of any matter, and let no man trouble him for any manner of cause. 
1MA.10.64	And it came to pass, when those who complained against him saw his glory according as 
1MA.10.65	And the king gave him honour, and wrote him amongst his
1MA.10.66	And Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace and gladness.
1MA.10.67	And in
1MA.10.68	and king Alexander heard thereof, and he grieved exceedingly, and returned to Antioch. 
1MA.10.69	And Demetrius appointed Apollonius, who was over Coelesyria, and he gathered together a great army, and encamped in Jamnia, and sent to Jonathan the high priest, saying,
1MA.10.70	You alone lift up yourself against us, but I am had in derision and in reproach because of you. And why do you vaunt your power against us in the mountains? 
1MA.10.71	Now therefore, if you trust in your forces, come down to us into the plain, and there let’s try the matter together; for with me is the power of the cities. 
1MA.10.72	Ask and learn who I am, and the rest that help us; and they say, Your foot can’t stand before our face; for your fathers have been twice put to flight in their own land. 
1MA.10.73	And now you shall not be able to withstand the horse and such an army as this in the plain, where is neither stone nor flint, nor place to flee to.
1MA.10.74	Now when Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind, and he chose out ten thousand men, and went forth from Jerusalem, and Simon his brother met him for to help him. 
1MA.10.75	And he encamped against Joppa: and they of the city shut him out, because Apollonius had a garrison in Joppa: 
1MA.10.76	and they fought against it. And they of the city were afraid, and opened to him: and Jonathan became master of Joppa. 
1MA.10.77	And Apollonius heard, and he gathered an army of three thousand horse, and a great army, and went to Azotus as though he were on a journey, and therewithal drew onward into the plain, because he had a multitude of horse, and trusted therein. 
1MA.10.78	And he pursued after him to Azotus, and the armies joined battle
1MA.10.79	And Apollonius had left a thousand horse behind them privily. 
1MA.10.80	And Jonathan knew that there was an ambushment behind him. And they compassed round his army, and cast their darts at the people, from morning until evening: 
1MA.10.81	but the people stood still, as Jonathan commanded them: and their horses were wearied. 
1MA.10.82	And Simon drew forth his army, and joined battle with the phalanx (for the horsemen were spent), and they were discomfited by him, and fled. 
1MA.10.83	And the horsemen were scattered in the plain, and they fled to Azotus, and entered into Beth-dagon, their idol’s temple, to save themselves. 
1MA.10.84	And Jonathan burnt Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, and those who fled into it, he burnt with fire. 
1MA.10.85	And those who had fallen by the sword, with those who were burnt, were about eight thousand men. 
1MA.10.86	And from thence Jonathan removed, and encamped against Ascalon, and they of the city came forth to meet him with great pomp. 
1MA.10.87	And Jonathan, with those who were on his side, returned to Jerusalem, having many spoils. 
1MA.10.88	And it came to pass, when king Alexander heard these things, he honoured Jonathan yet more; 
1MA.10.89	and he sent to him a buckle of gold, as the use is to give to such as are of the kindred of the kings: and he gave him Ekron and all the coasts thereof for a possession.
1MA.11.1	And the king of Egypt gathered together great forces, as the sand which is by the sea shore, and many ships, and sought to make himself master of Alexander’s kingdom by deceit, and to add it to his own kingdom. 
1MA.11.2	And he went forth into Syria with words of peace, and they of the cities opened to him, and met him; For king Alexander’s commandment was that they should meet him, because he was his father-in-law. 
1MA.11.3	Now as he entered into the cities of Ptolemais, he set his forces for a garrison in each city. 
1MA.11.4	But when he came near to Azotus, they showed him the temple of Dagon burnt with fire, and Azotus and the pasture lands thereof pulled down, and the bodies cast abroad, and those who had been burnt, whom he burnt in the war, for they had made heaps of them in his way. 
1MA.11.5	And they told the king what things Jonathan had done, that they might cast blame on him: and the king held his peace. 
1MA.11.6	And Jonathan met the king with pomp at Joppa, and they saluted one another, and they slept there. 
1MA.11.7	And Jonathan went with the king as far as the river that is called Eleutherus, and returned to Jerusalem. 
1MA.11.8	But king Ptolemy became master of the cities upon the sea coast, to Selucia which is by the sea, and he devised evil plans concerning Alexander. 
1MA.11.9	And he sent ambassadors to king Demetrius, saying, Come! Let’s make a covenant with one another, and I will give you my daughter whom Alexander has, and you shall reign over your father’s kingdom; 
1MA.11.10	for I have repented that I gave my daughter to him, for he sought to kill me. 
1MA.11.11	And he cast blame on him, because he coveted his kingdom. 
1MA.11.12	And taking his daughter from him, he gave her to Demetrius, and was estranged from Alexander, and their enmity was openly seen. 
1MA.11.13	And Ptolemy entered into Antioch, and put on himself the diadem of Asia; and he put two diadems upon his head, the diadem of Egypt and that of Asia. 
1MA.11.14	But king Alexander was in Cilicia at that season, because they of those parts were in revolt. 
1MA.11.15	And Alexander heard of it, and he came against him in war: and Ptolemy led forth 
1MA.11.16	And Alexander fled into Arabia, that he might be sheltered there; but king Ptolemy was exalted. 
1MA.11.17	And Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander’s head, and sent it to Ptolemy. 
1MA.11.18	And king Ptolemy died the third day after, and those who were in his strongholds were slain by those who were in the strongholds. 
1MA.11.19	And Demetrius reigned in
1MA.11.20	In those days Jonathan gathered together them of Judea, to take the citadel that was at Jerusalem: and he made many engines of war against it. 
1MA.11.21	And certain that hated their own nation, men that transgressed the law, went to the king, and reported to him that Jonathan was besieging the citadel. 
1MA.11.22	And he heard, and was angered; but when he heard it, he set forth immediately, and came to Ptolemais, and wrote to Jonathan, that he should not besiege it, and that he should meet him and speak with him at Ptolemais with all speed. 
1MA.11.23	But when Jonathan heard this, he commanded to besiege it 
1MA.11.24	and taking silver and gold and raiment and various presents besides, went to Ptolemais to the king. And he found favour in his sight. 
1MA.11.25	And certain lawless men of those who were of the nation made complaints against him, 
1MA.11.26	and the king did to him even as his predecessors had done to him, and exalted him in the sight of all his
1MA.11.27	and confirmed to him the high priesthood, and all the other honours that he had before, and gave him preeminence amongst his
1MA.11.28	And Jonathan requested of the king, that he would make Judea free from tribute, and the three
1MA.11.29	And the king consented, and wrote letters to Jonathan concerning all these things after this manner:
1MA.11.30	King Demetrius to his brother Jonathan, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting: 
1MA.11.31	The copy of the letter which we wrote to Lasthenes our kinsman concerning you, we have written also to you, that you° may see it. 
1MA.11.32	King Demetrius to Lasthenes his father, greeting: 
1MA.11.33	We have determined to do good to the nation of the Jews, who are our friends, and observe what is just towards us, because of their good will towards us. 
1MA.11.34	We have confirmed therefore to them the borders of Judea, and also the three governments of Aphaerema and Lydda and Ramathaim (
1MA.11.35	And as for the other things that pertain to us from henceforth, of the tenths and the tolls that pertain to us, and the salt pits, and the crowns that pertain to us, all these we will bestow upon them. 
1MA.11.36	And not one of these things shall be annulled from this time forth and forever. 
1MA.11.37	Now therefore be careful to make a copy of these things, and let it be given to Jonathan, and let it be set up on the holy mount in a meet and conspicuous place.
1MA.11.38	And king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made to him, and he sent away all his forces, each man to his own place, except the foreign forces, which he had raised from the isles of the Gentiles: and all the forces of his fathers hated him. 
1MA.11.39	Now Tryphon was of those who aforetime had been of Alexander’s part, and he saw that all the forces murmured against Demetrius, and he went to Imalcue the Arabian, who was nourishing up Antiochus the young child of Alexander, 
1MA.11.40	and pressed sore upon him that he should deliver him to him, that he might reign in his father’s stead: and he told him all that Demetrius had done, and the hatred wherewith his forces hated him; and he abode there many days.
1MA.11.41	And Jonathan sent to king Demetrius, that he should cast out of Jerusalem them of the citadel, and those who were in the strongholds; for they fought against Israel continually. 
1MA.11.42	And Demetrius sent to Jonathan, saying, I will not only do this for you and your nation, but I will greatly honour you and your nation, if I find fair occasion. 
1MA.11.43	Now therefore you shall do well, if you send me men who shall fight for me; for all my forces are revolted. 
1MA.11.44	And Jonathan sent him three thousand valiant men to Antioch: and they came to the king, and the king was glad at their coming. 
1MA.11.45	And they of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of a hundred and twenty thousand men, and they were minded to kill the king. 
1MA.11.46	And the king fled into the court of the palace, and they of the city seized the passages of the city, and began to fight. 
1MA.11.47	And the king called the Jews to help him, and they were gathered together to him all at once, and they dispersed themselves in the city, and killed that day to the number of a hundred thousand. 
1MA.11.48	And they set the city on fire, and got many spoils that day, and saved the king. 
1MA.11.49	And they of the city saw that the Jews had made themselves masters of the city as they would, and they waxed faint in their hearts, and they cried out to the king with supplication, saying, 
1MA.11.50	Give us your right hand, and let the Jews cease from fighting against us and the city. 
1MA.11.51	And they cast away their arms, and made peace; and the Jews were glorified in the sight of the king, and before all that were in his kingdom; and they returned to Jerusalem, having many spoils. 
1MA.11.52	And king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him. 
1MA.11.53	And he lied in all that he spoke, and estranged himself from Jonathan, and recompensed him not according to the benefits with which he had recompensed him, and afflicted him exceedingly.
1MA.11.54	Now after this Tryphon returned, and with him the young child Antiochus; and he reigned, and put on a diadem. 
1MA.11.55	And there were gathered to him all the forces which Demetrius had sent away with disgrace, and they fought against him, and he fled and was put to the rout. 
1MA.11.56	And Tryphon took the elephants, and became master of Antioch. 
1MA.11.57	And the young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, I confirm to you the high priesthood, and appoint you over the four governments, and to be one of the king’s
1MA.11.58	And he sent to him golden vessels and furniture for the table, and gave him leave to drink in golden vessels, and to be clothed in purple, and to have a golden buckle. 
1MA.11.59	And his brother Simon he made captain from the Ladder of Tyre to the borders of Egypt. 
1MA.11.60	And Jonathan went forth, and took his journey beyond the river and through the cities; and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves to him for to be his allies. And he came to Ascalon, and they of the city met him honourably. 
1MA.11.61	And he departed thence to Gaza, and they of Gaza shut him out; and he laid siege to it, and burnt the pasture lands thereof with fire, and plundered them. 
1MA.11.62	And they of Gaza made request to Jonathan, and he gave them his right hand, and took the sons of their princes for hostages, and sent them away to Jerusalem; and he passed through the country as far as Damascus.
1MA.11.63	And Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes were come to Kedesh, which is in Galilee, with a great army, purposing to remove him from his office; 
1MA.11.64	and he went to meet them, but Simon his brother he left in the country. 
1MA.11.65	And Simon encamped against Bethsura, and fought against it many days, and shut it up: 
1MA.11.66	and they made request to him that he would give them his right hand, and he gave it to them; and he put them out from thence, and took possession of the city, and set a garrison over it. 
1MA.11.67	And Jonathan and his army encamped at the water of Gennesareth, and early in the morning they got them to the plain of Hazor. 
1MA.11.68	And, behold, an army of strangers met him in the plain, and they laid an ambush for him in the mountains, but themselves met him face to face. 
1MA.11.69	But those who lay in ambush rose out of their places, and joined battle; and all those who were of Jonathan’s side fled: 
1MA.11.70	not one of them was left, except Mattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Chalphi, captains of the forces. 
1MA.11.71	And Jonathan tore his clothes, and put earth upon his head, and prayed. 
1MA.11.72	And he turned again to them in battle, and put them to the rout, and they fled. 
1MA.11.73	And they of his side that fled saw it, and returned to him, and pursued with him to Kedesh to their camp, and they encamped there. 
1MA.11.74	And there fell of the strangers on that day about three thousand men: and Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.
1MA.12.1	And Jonathan saw that the time served him, and he chose men, and sent them to Rome, to confirm and renew the friendship that they had with them. 
1MA.12.2	And to the Spartans, and to other places, he sent letters after the same manner. 
1MA.12.3	And they went to Rome, and entered into the senate house, and said, Jonathan the high priest, and the nation of the Jews, have sent us, to renew for them the friendship and the confederacy, as in former time. 
1MA.12.4	And they gave them letters to the men in every place, that they should bring them on their way to the land of Judah in peace. 
1MA.12.5	And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:
1MA.12.6	Jonathan the high priest, and the senate of the nation, and the priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews, to their kindred the Spartans, greeting: 
1MA.12.7	Even before this time were letters sent to Onias the high priest from
1MA.12.8	And Onias entreated honourably the man that was sent, and received the letters, wherein declaration was made of confederacy and friendship. 
1MA.12.9	Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, having for our encouragement the holy books which are in our hands, 
1MA.12.10	have assayed to send that we might renew our brotherhood and friendship with you, to the end that we should not become estranged from you altogether: for long time is passed since you° sent to us. 
1MA.12.11	We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and on the other convenient days, do remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as it is right and meet to be mindful of kindred: 
1MA.12.12	and moreover are glad for your glory. 
1MA.12.13	But as for ourselves, many afflictions and many wars have encompassed us, and the kings that are round about us have fought against us. 
1MA.12.14	We were not minded therefore to be troublesome to you, and to the rest of our allies and friends, in these wars; 
1MA.12.15	for we have the help which is from heaven to help us, and we have been delivered from our enemies, and our enemies have been brought low. 
1MA.12.16	We chose therefore Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater the son of Jason, and have sent them to the Romans, to renew the friendship that we had with them, and the former confederacy. 
1MA.12.17	We commanded them therefore to go also to you, and to salute you, and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing 
1MA.12.18	And now you° shall do well if you° give us an answer thereto.
1MA.12.19	And this is the copy of the letters which they sent to Onias:
1MA.12.20	Arius king of the Spartans to Onias the chief priest, greeting: 
1MA.12.21	It has been found in writing, concerning the Spartans and the Jews, that they are kindred, and that they are of the stock of Abraham: 
1MA.12.22	and now, since this is come to our knowledge, you° shall do well to write to us of your
1MA.12.23	And we moreover do write on our part to you, that your cattle and goods are ours, and ours are yours. We do command therefore that they make report to you on this wise.
1MA.12.24	And Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes were returned to fight against him with a greater army than before, 
1MA.12.25	and he removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the country of Hamath; for he gave them no respite to set foot in his country. 
1MA.12.26	And he sent spies into his camp, and they came again, and reported to him that they were appointed in such and such a way to fall upon them in the night season. 
1MA.12.27	But as soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be in arms, that all the night long they might be ready for battle: and he put forth sentinels round about the camp. 
1MA.12.28	And the adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, and they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp
1MA.12.29	But Jonathan and his men knew it not till the morning; for they saw the lights burning. 
1MA.12.30	And Jonathan pursued after them, and overtook them not; for they were gone over the river Eleutherus. 
1MA.12.31	And Jonathan turned towards the Arabians, who are called Zabadaeans, and struck them, and took their spoils. 
1MA.12.32	And he came out from thence, and came to Damascus, and took his journey through all the country. 
1MA.12.33	And Simon went forth, and took his journey as far as Ascalon, and the strongholds that were near to it. And he turned towards Joppa, and took possession of it; 
1MA.12.34	for he had heard that they were minded to deliver the stronghold to the men of Demetrius; and he set a garrison there to keep it.
1MA.12.35	And Jonathan returned, and called the elders of the people together; and he took counsel with them to build strongholds in Judea, 
1MA.12.36	and to make the walls of Jerusalem higher, and to raise a great mound between the citadel and the city, for to separate it from the city, that so it might be all alone, that men might neither buy nor sell. 
1MA.12.37	And they were gathered together to build the city, and there fell down part of the wall of the brook that is on the east side, and he repaired that which is called Chaphenatha. 
1MA.12.38	And Simon also built Adida in the
1MA.12.39	And Tryphon sought to reign over Asia and to put on himself the diadem, and to stretch forth his hand against Antiochus the king. 
1MA.12.40	And he was afraid lest perhaps Jonathan should not suffer him, and lest he should fight against him; and he sought a way how to take him, that he might destroy him. And he removed, and came to Bethshan. 
1MA.12.41	And Jonathan came forth to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for battle, and came to Bethshan. 
1MA.12.42	And Tryphon saw that he came with a great army, and he was afraid to stretch forth his hand against him: 
1MA.12.43	and he received him honourably, and commended him to all his
1MA.12.44	And he said to Jonathan, Why have you put all this people to trouble, seeing there is no war between us? 
1MA.12.45	And now send them away to their homes, but choose for yourself a few men who shall be with you, and come you with me to Ptolemais, and I will give it up to you, and the rest of the strongholds and the rest of the forces, and all the king’s officers: and I will return and depart; for this is the cause of my coming. 
1MA.12.46	And he put his trust in him, and did even as he said, and sent away his forces, and they departed into the land of Judah. 
1MA.12.47	But he reserved to himself three thousand men, of whom he left two thousand in Galilee, but one thousand went with him. 
1MA.12.48	Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates, and laid hands on him; and all those who came in with him they killed with the sword. 
1MA.12.49	And Tryphon sent forces and horsemen into Galilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan’s men. 
1MA.12.50	And they perceived that he was taken and had perished, and those who were with him; and they encouraged one another, and went on their way close together, prepared to fight. 
1MA.12.51	And those who followed upon them saw that they were ready to fight for their lives, and turned back again. 
1MA.12.52	And they all came in peace into the land of Judah, and they mourned for Jonathan, and those who were with him, and they were sore afraid; and all Israel mourned with a great mourning. 
1MA.12.53	And all the Gentiles that were round about them sought to destroy them utterly: for they said, They have no ruler, nor any to help them: now therefore let’s fight against them, and take away their memorial from amongst men.
1MA.13.1	And Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered together a mighty army to come into the land of Judah, and destroy it utterly. 
1MA.13.2	And he saw that the people trembled and was in great fear; and he went up to Jerusalem, and gathered the people together; 
1MA.13.3	and he encouraged them, and said to them, You° yourselves know all the things that I, and my kindred, and my father’s house, have done for the laws and the sanctuary, and the battles and the distresses which we have seen: 
1MA.13.4	by reason of this all my kindred have perished for Israel’s sake, and I am left alone. 
1MA.13.5	And now be it far from me, that I should spare my own life in any time of affliction; for I am not better than my kindred. 
1MA.13.6	However I will take vengeance for my nation, and for the sanctuary, and for our wives and children; because all the Gentiles are gathered to destroy us of very hatred. 
1MA.13.7	And the spirit of the people revived, as soon as they heard these words. 
1MA.13.8	And they answered with a loud voice, saying, You are our leader instead of Judas and Jonathan your brother. 
1MA.13.9	Fight you our battles, and all that you shall say to us, that will we do. 
1MA.13.10	And he gathered together all the men of war, and made haste to finish the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about. 
1MA.13.11	And he sent Jonathan the son of Absalom, and with him a great army, to Joppa: and he cast out those who were therein, and abode there in it.
1MA.13.12	And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a mighty army to enter into the land of Judah, and Jonathan was with him in ward. 
1MA.13.13	But Simon encamped at Adida, near the plain. 
1MA.13.14	And Tryphon knew that Simon was risen up instead of his brother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with him, and he sent ambassadors to him, saying, 
1MA.13.15	It is for money which Jonathan your brother owed to the king’s treasure, by reason of the offices which he had, that we hold him fast. 
1MA.13.16	And now send a hundred talents of silver, and two of his sons for hostages, that when he is set at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will set him at liberty. 
1MA.13.17	And Simon knew that they spoke to him deceitfully; and he sent the money and the children, lest perhaps he should procure to himself great hatred of the people, 
1MA.13.18	and they should say, Because I sent him not the money and the children, he perished. 
1MA.13.19	And he sent the children and the hundred talents. And he dealt falsely, and didn’t set Jonathan at liberty. 
1MA.13.20	And after this Tryphon came to invade the land, and destroy it, and he went round about by the way that leads to Adora: and Simon and his army marched near him to every place, wherever he went. 
1MA.13.21	Now they of the citadel sent to Tryphon ambassadors, hastening him to come to them through the wilderness, and to send them food. 
1MA.13.22	And Tryphon made ready all his horse to come: and on that night there fell a very great snow, and he came not by reason of the snow. And he removed, and came into the country of Gilead. 
1MA.13.23	But when he came near to Bascama, he killed Jonathan, and he was buried there. 
1MA.13.24	And Tryphon returned, and went away into his own land.
1MA.13.25	And Simon sent, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried him at Modin, the city of his fathers. 
1MA.13.26	And all Israel made great lamentation over him, and mourned for him many days. 
1MA.13.27	And Simon built 
1MA.13.28	And he set up seven pyramids, one near another, for his father, and his mother, and his four kindred. 
1MA.13.29	And for these he made cunning devices, setting about them great pillars, and upon the pillars he fashioned
1MA.13.30	This is the sepulchre which he made at Modin, 
1MA.13.31	Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the young king Antiochus, and killed him, 
1MA.13.32	and reigned in his stead, and put on himself the diadem of Asia, and brought a great calamity upon the land. 
1MA.13.33	And Simon built the strongholds of Judea, and fenced them about with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars; and he laid up food in the strongholds. 
1MA.13.34	And Simon chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to the end he should give the country an immunity, because all that Tryphon did was to plunder. 
1MA.13.35	And king Demetrius sent to him according to these words, and answered him, and wrote a letter to him, after this manner:
1MA.13.36	King Demetrius to Simon the high priest and
1MA.13.37	The golden crown, and the palm branch, which you° sent, we have received: and we are ready to make a
1MA.13.38	And whatever things we confirmed to you, they are confirmed; and the strongholds, which you° have built, let them be your own. 
1MA.13.39	As for any oversights and faults committed to this day, we forgive them, and the crown which you° owed us: and if there were any other toll exacted in Jerusalem, let it be exacted no longer. 
1MA.13.40	And if there be any amongst you meet to be enrolled in our court, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.
1MA.13.41	In
1MA.13.42	And the people began to write in their instruments and contracts, In the first year of Simon, the great high priest and captain and leader of the Jews.
1MA.13.43	In those days he encamped against
1MA.13.44	And those who were in the engine leapt forth into the city; and there was a great uproar in the city: 
1MA.13.45	and they of the city tore their clothes, and went up on the walls with their wives and children, and cried with a loud voice, making request to Simon to give them
1MA.13.46	And they said, Deal not with us according to our wickednesses, but according to your mercy. 
1MA.13.47	And Simon was reconciled to them, and didn’t fight against them: and he put them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein the idols were, and so entered into it with singing and giving praise. 
1MA.13.48	And he put all uncleanness out of it, and placed in it such men as would keep the law, and made it stronger than it was before, and built therein a dwelling place for himself.
1MA.13.49	But they of the citadel in Jerusalem were hindered from going forth, and from going into the country, and from buying and selling; and they hungered exceedingly, and a great number of them perished through famine. 
1MA.13.50	And they cried out to Simon, that he should give them his right hand; and he gave it to them: and he put them out from thence, and he cleansed the citadel from its pollutions. 
1MA.13.51	And he entered into it on the three and twentieth day of the second month, in
1MA.13.52	And he ordained that they should keep that day every year with gladness. And the hill of the temple that was by the citadel he made stronger than before, and there he lived, himself and his men. 
1MA.13.53	And Simon saw that John his son was a 
1MA.14.1	And in
1MA.14.2	And Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard that Demetrius was come into his borders, and he sent one of his princes to take him alive: 
1MA.14.3	and he went and struck the army of Demetrius, and took him, and brought him to Arsaces; and he put him in ward.
1MA.14.4	And the land had rest all the days of Simon: and he sought the good of his nation; and his authority and his glory was well-pleasing to them all his days. 
1MA.14.5	And amid all his glory he took Joppa for a haven, and made it an entrance for the isles of the sea; 
1MA.14.6	and he enlarged the borders of his nation, and got possession of the country; 
1MA.14.7	and he gathered together a great number of captives, and got the dominion of Gazara, and Bethsura, and the citadel, and he took away from it its uncleannesses; and there was none that resisted him. 
1MA.14.8	And they tilled their land in peace, and the land gave her increase, and the trees of the plains their fruit. 
1MA.14.9	The ancient men sat in the streets, they communed all of them together of good things, and the young men put on glorious and warlike apparel. 
1MA.14.10	He provided food for the cities, and furnished them with
1MA.14.11	He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced with great joy: 
1MA.14.12	and they sat each man under his vine and his fig tree, and there was none to make them afraid: 
1MA.14.13	and there ceased in the land any that fought against them: and the kings were discomfited in those days. 
1MA.14.14	And he strengthened all those of his people that were brought low: the law he searched out, and every lawless and wicked person he took away. 
1MA.14.15	He glorified the sanctuary, and the vessels of the temple he multiplied.
1MA.14.16	And it was heard at Rome that Jonathan was dead, and even to Sparta, and they were exceedingly sorry. 
1MA.14.17	But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon was made high priest in his stead, and ruled the country, and the cities therein, 
1MA.14.18	they wrote to him on tables of brass, to renew with him the friendship and the confederacy which they had confirmed with Judas and Jonathan his kindred; 
1MA.14.19	and they were read before the congregation at Jerusalem. 
1MA.14.20	And this is the copy of the letters which the Spartans sent:
1MA.14.20	The rulers of the Spartans, and the city, to Simon the high priest, and to the elders, and the priests, and the residue of the people of the Jews, our kindred, greeting: 
1MA.14.21	The ambassadors that were sent to our people made report to us of your glory and honour: and we were glad for their coming, 
1MA.14.22	and we did register the things that were spoken by them in the
1MA.14.23	And it pleased the people to entertain the men honourably, and to put the copy of their words in the
1MA.14.24	After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a great shield of gold of a thousand pound weight, in order to confirm the confederacy with them.
1MA.14.25	But when the people heard these things, they said, What thanks shall we give to Simon and his sons? 
1MA.14.26	for he and his kindred and the house of his father have made themselves strong, and have chased away in fight the enemies of Israel from them, and confirmed liberty to
1MA.14.27	And they wrote on tables of brass, and set them upon pillars in mount Sion: and this is the copy of the writing:
1MA.14.27	On the eighteenth day of Elul, in
1MA.14.28	 in Asaramel, in a great congregation of priests and people and princes of the nation, and of the elders of the country,
1MA.14.29	Forasmuch as oftentimes there have been wars in the country, but Simon the son of Mattathias, the son of the sons of Joarib, and his kindred, put themselves in jeopardy, and withstood the enemies of their nation, that their sanctuary and the law might be established, and glorified their nation with great glory: 
1MA.14.30	and Jonathan assembled their nation together, and became their high priest, and was gathered to his people: 
1MA.14.31	and their enemies purposed to invade their country, that they might destroy their country utterly, and stretch forth their hands against their sanctuary: 
1MA.14.32	then rose up Simon, and fought for his nation, and spent much of his own substance, and armed the valiant men of his nation, and gave them wages: 
1MA.14.33	and he fortified the cities of Judea, and Bethsura that lies upon the borders of Judea, where the arms of the enemies were aforetime, and set there a garrison of Jews: 
1MA.14.34	and he fortified Joppa which is upon the sea, and Gazara which is upon the borders of Azotus, wherein the enemies lived aforetime, and placed Jews there, and set therein all things convenient for their restoration: 
1MA.14.35	and the people saw the
1MA.14.36	and in his days things prospered in his hands, so that the Gentiles were taken away out of their country, and they also that were in the city of David, those who were in Jerusalem, who had made themselves a citadel, out of which they issued, and polluted all things round about the sanctuary, and did great hurt to its purity; 
1MA.14.37	and he placed Jews therein, and fortified it for the safety of the country and the city, and made high the walls of Jerusalem: 
1MA.14.38	and king Demetrius confirmed to him the high priesthood according to these things, 
1MA.14.39	and made him one of his
1MA.14.40	for he had heard say, that the Jews had been called by the Romans friends and allies and kindred, and that they had met the ambassadors of Simon honourably; 
1MA.14.41	and that the Jews and the priests were well pleased that Simon should be their leader and high priest forever, until there should arise a faithful prophet; 
1MA.14.42	and that he should be captain over them, and should take charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and over the country, and over the arms, and over the strongholds; and that he should take charge of the sanctuary, 
1MA.14.43	and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all instruments in the country should be written in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold; 
1MA.14.44	and that it should not be lawful for any of the people or of the priests to set at nothing any of these things, or to gainsay the words that he should speak, or to gather an assembly in the country without him, or to be clothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold; 
1MA.14.45	but whoever should do otherwise, or set at nothing any of these things, he should be liable to punishment. 
1MA.14.46	All the people consented to ordain for Simon that he should do according to these words; 
1MA.14.47	and Simon accepted this, and consented to be high priest, and to be captain and
1MA.14.48	And they commanded to put this writing on tables of brass, and to set them up within the precinct of the sanctuary in a conspicuous place; 
1MA.14.49	and moreover to put the copies thereof in the treasury, to the end that Simon and his sons might have them.
1MA.15.1	And Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent letters from the isles of the sea to Simon the priest and
1MA.15.2	and the contents thereof were after this manner:
1MA.15.2	King Antiochus to Simon the chief priest and
1MA.15.3	Forasmuch as certain pestilent fellows have made themselves masters of the kingdom of our fathers, but my purpose is to claim the kingdom, that I may restore it as it was before; and moreover I have raised a multitude of foreign soldiers, and have prepared ships of war; 
1MA.15.4	moreover I am minded to land in the country, that I may punish those who have destroyed our country, and those who have made many cities in the kingdom desolate: 
1MA.15.5	Now therefore I confirm to you all the exactions which the kings that were before me remitted to you, and whatever gifts besides they remitted to you: 
1MA.15.6	and I give you leave to coin money for your country with your own stamp, 
1MA.15.7	but that Jerusalem and the sanctuary should be free: and all the arms that you have prepared, and the strongholds that you have built, which you have in your possession, let them remain to you: 
1MA.15.8	and everything owing to the king, and the things that shall be owing to the king from henceforth and for evermore, let them be remitted to you: 
1MA.15.9	moreover, when we shall have established our kingdom, we will glorify you and your nation and the temple with great glory, so that your glory shall be made manifest in all the earth.
1MA.15.10	In
1MA.15.11	And king Antiochus pursued him, and
1MA.15.12	for he knew that troubles were come upon him all at once, and that his forces had forsaken him. 
1MA.15.13	And Antiochus encamped against Dor, and with him a hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand horse. 
1MA.15.14	And he compassed the city round about, and the ships joined in the attack from the sea; and he vexed the city by land and sea, and suffered no man to go out or in.
1MA.15.15	And Numenius and his company came from Rome, having letters to the kings and to the countries, wherein were written these things:
1MA.15.16	Lucius, consul of the Romans, to king Ptolemy, greeting: 
1MA.15.17	The Jews’ ambassadors came to us as our friends and allies, to renew the old friendship and confederacy, being sent from Simon the high priest, and from the people of the Jews: 
1MA.15.18	moreover they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pounds. 
1MA.15.19	It pleased us therefore to write to the kings and to the countries, that they should not seek their hurt, nor fight against them, and their cities, and their country, nor be allies with such as fight against them. 
1MA.15.20	Moreover it seemed good to us to receive the shield of them. 
1MA.15.21	If therefore any pestilent fellows have fled from their country to you, deliver them to Simon the high priest, that he may take vengeance on them according to their law.
1MA.15.22	And the same things wrote he to Demetrius the king, and to Attalus, and to Arathes, and to Arsaces, 
1MA.15.23	and to all the countries, and to
1MA.15.24	But they wrote this copy to Simon the high priest.
1MA.15.25	But Antiochus the king encamped against Dor the second day, bringing his forces up to it continually, and making engines of war, and he shut up Tryphon from going in or out. 
1MA.15.26	And Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to fight on his side; and silver, and gold, and instruments of war in abundance. 
1MA.15.27	And he would not receive them, but set at nothing all the covenants which he had made with him aforetime, and was estranged from him. 
1MA.15.28	And he sent to him Athenobius, one of his
1MA.15.28	You° hold possession of Joppa and Gazara, and the citadel that is in Jerusalem, cities of my kingdom. 
1MA.15.29	The borders thereof you° have wasted, and done great hurt in the land, and got the dominion of many places in my kingdom. 
1MA.15.30	Now therefore deliver up the cities which you° have taken, and the tributes of the places whereof you° have gotten dominion without the borders of Judea: 
1MA.15.31	or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver; and for the harm that you° have done, and the tributes of the cities, other five hundred talents: or else we will come and subdue you.
1MA.15.32	And Athenobius the king’s
1MA.15.33	And Simon answered, and said to him,
1MA.15.33	We have neither taken other men’s land, nor have we possession of that which appertains to others, but of the inheritance of our fathers; however, it was had in possession of our enemies wrongfully for a certain time. 
1MA.15.34	But we, having opportunity, hold fast the inheritance of our fathers. 
1MA.15.35	But as touching Joppa and Gazara, which you demand, they did great harm amongst the people throughout our country, we will give a hundred talents for them.
1MA.15.35	And he answered him not a word, 
1MA.15.36	but returned in a rage to the king, and reported to him these words, and the glory of Simon, and all that he had seen: and the king was exceedingly angry. 
1MA.15.37	But Tryphon embarked on board a ship, and fled to Orthosia.
1MA.15.38	And the king appointed Cendebaeus chief captain of the sea coast, and gave him forces of foot and horse: 
1MA.15.39	and he commanded him to encamp before Judea, and he commanded him to build up Kidron, and to fortify the gates, and that he should fight against the people: but the king pursued Tryphon. 
1MA.15.40	And Cendebaeus came to Jamnia, and began to provoke the people, and to invade Judea, and to take the people captive, and to kill them. 
1MA.15.41	And he built Kidron, and set horsemen there, and forces of foot, to the end that issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea, according as the king commanded him.
1MA.16.1	And John went up from Gazara, and told Simon his father what Cendebaeus was doing. 
1MA.16.2	And Simon called his two oldest sons, Judas and John, and said to them, I and my kindred and my father’s house have fought the battles of Israel from our youth, even to this day; and things have prospered in our hands, that we should deliver Israel oftentimes. 
1MA.16.3	But now I am old, and you° moreover, by 
1MA.16.4	And he chose out of the country twenty thousand men of war and horsemen, and they went against Cendebaeus, and slept at Modin. 
1MA.16.5	And rising up in the morning, they went into the plain, and, behold, a great army came to meet them, of footmen and horsemen: and there was a brook between them. 
1MA.16.6	And he encamped near them, he and his people: and he saw that the people were afraid to pass over the brook, and he passed over first, and the men saw him, and passed over after him. 
1MA.16.7	And he divided the people, and 
1MA.16.8	And they sounded with the trumpets; and Cendebaeus and his army were put to the rout, and there fell of them many wounded to death, but those who were left fled to the stronghold: 
1MA.16.9	at that time was Judas, John’s brother, wounded: but John pursued after them, till he came to Kidron, which 
1MA.16.10	and they fled to the towers that are in the fields of Azotus; and he burnt it with fire; and there fell of them about two thousand men. And he returned into Judea in peace.
1MA.16.11	And Ptolemy the son of Abubus had been appointed captain for the plain of Jericho, and he had much silver and gold; 
1MA.16.12	for he was the high priest’s son in law. 
1MA.16.13	And his heart was lifted up, and he was minded to make himself master of the country, and he took counsel deceitfully against Simon and his sons, to make away with them. 
1MA.16.14	Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country, and taking care for the good ordering of them; and he went down to Jericho, himself and Mattathias and Judas his sons, in
1MA.16.15	and the son of Abubus received them deceitfully into the little stronghold that is called Dok, which he had built, and made them a great banquet, and hid men there. 
1MA.16.16	And when Simon and his sons had drunk freely, Ptolemy and his men rose up, and took their arms, and came in upon Simon into the banqueting place, and killed him, and his two sons, and certain of his servants. 
1MA.16.17	And he committed a great iniquity, and recompensed evil for good. 
1MA.16.18	And Ptolemy wrote these things, and sent to the king, that he should send him forces to aid him, and should deliver him their country and the cities. 
1MA.16.19	And he sent others to Gazara to make away with John: and to the captains of thousands he sent letters to come to him, that he might give them silver and gold and gifts. 
1MA.16.20	And others he sent to take possession of Jerusalem, and the mount of the temple. 
1MA.16.21	And one ran before to Gazara, and told John that his father and kindred were perished, and he has sent to kill you also. 
1MA.16.22	And when he heard, he was sore amazed; and he laid hands on the men that came to destroy him, and killed them; for he perceived that they were seeking to destroy him.
1MA.16.23	And the rest of the acts of John, and of his wars, and of his valiant deeds which he did, and of the building of the walls which he built, and of his doings, 
1MA.16.24	behold, they are written in the
2MA.1.1	The kindred, the Jews that are in Jerusalem and those who are in the country of Judea, send greeting to the kindred, the Jews that are throughout Egypt, 
2MA.1.2	and may God do good to you, and remember his covenant with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, his faithful servants; 
2MA.1.3	and give you all a heart to worship him and do his
2MA.1.4	and open your heart in his law and in his statutes, and make peace, 
2MA.1.5	and listen to your requests, and be reconciled with you, and not forsake you in an evil time. 
2MA.1.6	And now we here are praying for you. 
2MA.1.7	In the reign of Demetrius, in the hundred threescore and ninth year, we the Jews have 
2MA.1.8	and set the

2MA.1.10	 in the hundred fourscore and eighth year.
2MA.1.10	THEY that are in Jerusalem and those who are in Judea and the senate and Judas, to Aristobulus, king Ptolemy’s teacher, who is also of the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jews that are in Egypt, send greeting and health. 
2MA.1.11	Having been saved by God out of great perils, as men arrayed against a king, we thank him greatly. 
2MA.1.12	For he cast forth into Persia those who arrayed themselves 
2MA.1.13	For when the prince was come 
2MA.1.14	For Antiochus, on the pretence that he would marry her, came into the place, he and his
2MA.1.15	And when the priests of Nanaea’s temple had set
2MA.1.16	and opening the secret door of the panelled ceiling, they threw stones and

2MA.1.18	Whereas we are now about to keep the purification of the temple in the 
2MA.1.19	For indeed when our fathers were about to be led into the land of Persia, the godly priests of that time took of the fire of the altar, and hid it privily in the hollow of a well that was without water, wherein they made 
2MA.1.20	Now after many years, when it pleased God, Nehemiah, having received a charge from the king of Persia, sent in quest of the fire the descendants of the priests that hid it. When they declared to us that they had found no fire, but thick water, 
2MA.1.21	he commanded them to draw out thereof and bring 
2MA.1.22	And when it was done, and some time had passed, and the sun shone out, which before was hid with clouds, there was kindled a great blaze, so that all men marvelled. 
2MA.1.23	And the priests made a prayer while the sacrifice was consuming, both the priests and all 
2MA.1.24	And the prayer was after this manner:
2MA.1.24	O Lord, Lord God, the Creator of all things, who are terrible and strong and righteous and merciful, who alone are King and gracious, 
2MA.1.25	who alone supply 
2MA.1.26	accept the sacrifice for all your people Israel, and guard your own portion, and consecrate it. 
2MA.1.27	Gather together our Dispersion, set at liberty those who are in bondage amongst the heathen, look upon those who are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that you are our God. 
2MA.1.28	Torment those who oppress us and in arrogance shamefully entreat us. 
2MA.1.29	Plant your people in your holy place, even as Moses said.
2MA.1.30	And thereupon the priests sang the hymns. 
2MA.1.31	And as soon as the sacrifice was consumed, then Nehemiah commanded
2MA.1.32	And when this was done, a flame was kindled;
2MA.1.33	And when the matter became known, and it was told the king of the Persians, that, in the place where the priests that were led away had hid the fire, there appeared the water, wherewith also Nehemiah and those who were with him purified the sacrifice, 
2MA.1.34	then the king, inclosing 
2MA.1.35	And when the king would show favour to any, he would take 
2MA.1.36	And Nehemiah and those who were with him called this thing Nephthar, which is by interpretation, Cleansing; but most men call it Nephthai.
2MA.2.1	It is also found in the records, that Jeremiah the prophet commanded those who were carried away to take of the fire, as has been signified 
2MA.2.2	and how that the prophet charged those who were carried away, having given them the law, that they should not forget the statutes of the Lord, neither be led astray in their minds, when they saw images of gold and silver, and the adornment thereof. 
2MA.2.3	And with other such words exhorted he them, that the law should not depart from their heart. 
2MA.2.4	And it was 
2MA.2.5	And Jeremiah came and found
2MA.2.6	And some of those that followed with him came there that they might mark the way, and could not find it. 
2MA.2.7	But when Jeremiah perceived it, he blamed them, saying, Yes and the place shall be unknown until God
2MA.2.8	and then shall the Lord disclose these things, and the glory of the Lord shall be seen, and the
2MA.2.8	As also it was showed with Moses; as also Solomon implored that the place might be consecrated greatly, 
2MA.2.9	and it was also declared that he, having wisdom, offered a sacrifice of dedication, and of the finishing of the temple; 
2MA.2.10	As Moses prayed to the Lord, and fire came down out of heaven and consumed the sacrifice, even so prayed Solomon also, and the fire came down and consumed the burnt offerings; 
2MA.2.11	(and Moses said, Because the sin offering had not been eaten, it was consumed in like manner 
2MA.2.12	and Solomon kept the eight days.
2MA.2.13	And the same things were related
2MA.2.14	And in like manner Judas also gathered together for us all those 
2MA.2.15	If therefore you° have need thereof, send some to fetch them to you.
2MA.2.16	Seeing then that we are about to keep the purification, we write to you; you° will therefore do well if you° keep the days. 
2MA.2.17	Now God, who saved all his people, and restored the heritage to all, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, and the hallowing, 
2MA.2.18	even as he promised through the law,— in God have we hope, that he will quickly have mercy upon us, and gather

2MA.2.19	Now the things concerning Judas Maccabaeus and his kindred, and the purification of the

2MA.2.21	and the manifestations that came from heaven to those that vied with one another in manful deeds for the religion of the Jews; so that, being but a few, they

2MA.2.23	 which have been declared by Jason of Cyrene in five books, we will assay to abridge in one work. 
2MA.2.24	For having in view the confused mass of the numbers, and the
2MA.2.25	we were careful that they who choose to read may be attracted, and that they who wish well 
2MA.2.26	And although to us, who have taken upon us the painful labour of the abridgement, the task is not easy, but 
2MA.2.27	(even as it is no light thing to him that prepares a banquet, and seeks the benefit of others); yet for the sake of the gratitude of the many we will gladly endure the painful labour, 
2MA.2.28	leaving to the historian the exact handling of every particular, and again
2MA.2.29	For as the masterbuilder of a new house must care for the whole
2MA.2.30	To occupy the ground, and to
2MA.2.31	but to strive after brevity of expression, and to avoid a laboured fullness in the treatment, is to be granted to him that would bring a writing into a new form. 
2MA.2.32	Here then let’s begin the narration, only adding thus much to that which has been already
2MA.3.1	WHEN the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and the laws were kept very well, because of the godliness of Onias the high priest, and his hatred of wickedness, 
2MA.3.2	it came to pass that even the kings themselves did honour the place, and glorify the temple with the noblest presents; 
2MA.3.3	insomuch that even Seleucus the king of Asia of his own revenues bare all the costs belonging to the services of the sacrifices. 
2MA.3.4	But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, having been made guardian of the temple, fell out with the high priest about the
2MA.3.5	And when he could not overcome Onias, he got him to Apollonius 
2MA.3.6	and he brought him word how that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of untold sums of money, so that the multitude of the funds was innumerable, and that they didn’t pertain to the account of the sacrifices, but that it was possible that these should fall under the king’s power. 
2MA.3.7	And when Apollonius met the king, he informed him of the money whereof he had been told; and the 
2MA.3.8	So forthwith Heliodorus took his journey, under a colour of visiting the cities of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, but in fact to execute the king’s purpose. 
2MA.3.9	And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously received by the high priest
2MA.3.10	And the high priest explained to him that there were 
2MA.3.11	and moreover some 
2MA.3.12	and that it was altogether impossible that wrong should be done to them that had put trust in the holiness of the place, and in the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honoured over all the world. 
2MA.3.13	But
2MA.3.14	So having appointed a day, he entered in to direct the enquiry concerning these matters; and there was no small distress throughout the whole city. 
2MA.3.15	And the priests, prostrating themselves before the altar in their priestly garments, and 
2MA.3.16	And whoever saw the mien of the high priest was wounded in mind; for his countenance and the change of his colour betrayed the distress of his soul. 
2MA.3.17	For a terror and a shuddering of the body had come over the man, whereby the pain that was in his heart was plainly shown to those who looked upon him. 
2MA.3.18	And those who were in the houses rushed flocking out to make a universal supplication, because the place was like to come into contempt. 
2MA.3.19	And the women, girded with sackcloth under their breasts, thronged the streets, and the virgins that were kept in ward ran together, some to the
2MA.3.20	And all, stretching forth their hands towards heaven, made their solemn supplication. 
2MA.3.21	Then it would have pitied a man to see the multitude prostrating themselves all mixed together, and the expectation of the high priest in his sore distress.
2MA.3.22	While therefore they called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the things entrusted 
2MA.3.23	Heliodorus went on to execute that which had been decreed. 
2MA.3.24	But when he was already present there with his guards near the treasury, the Sovereign of spirits and of all authority caused a great
2MA.3.25	For there was seen by them a horse with a terrible rider upon him, and adorned with beautiful trappings, and he rushed fiercely and struck at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he that sat upon the horse had complete armour of gold. 
2MA.3.26	Two others also appeared to him, young men notable in their strength, and beautiful in their glory, and splendid in their apparel, who stood by him on either side, and scourged him unceasingly, inflicting on him many sore stripes. 
2MA.3.27	And when he had fallen suddenly to the ground, and great darkness had come over him, 
2MA.3.28	and carried him, him that had just now entered with a great train and all his guard into the aforesaid treasury, himself now brought to utter helplessness, manifestly made to recognise the sovereignty of God. 
2MA.3.29	And so, while he, through the working of God, speechless and bereft of all hope and deliverance, lay prostrate, 
2MA.3.30	they blessed the Lord, that made marvellous his own place; and the temple, which a little before was full of terror and alarm, was filled with joy and gladness after the Almighty Lord appeared.
2MA.3.31	But quickly certain of Heliodorus’s familiar friends implored Onias to call upon the Most High, and grant life to him who lay quite at the last gasp. 
2MA.3.32	And the high priest, secretly fearing lest the king might come to think that some treachery towards Heliodorus had been perpetrated by the Jews, brought a sacrifice for the deliverance of the man. 
2MA.3.33	But as the high priest was making the atoning sacrifice, the same young men appeared again to Heliodorus, arrayed in the same garments; and they stood and said, Give Onias the high priest great thanks, for for his sake the Lord has granted you life; 
2MA.3.34	and do you, since you have been scourged from heaven, publish to all men the sovereign majesty of God. And when they had spoken these words, they vanished out of sight. 
2MA.3.35	So Heliodorus, having offered a sacrifice to the Lord and vowed
2MA.3.36	And he testified to all men the works of the
2MA.3.37	And when the king asked Heliodorus, what manner of man was fit to be sent yet once again to Jerusalem, he said, 
2MA.3.38	If you have any enemy or conspirator against the state, send him there, and you shall receive him back well scourged, if he even escape with his life; because of a truth there is about the place a power of God. 
2MA.3.39	For he that has his dwelling in heaven himself has his eyes upon that place, and helps it; and those who come to hurt it he strikes and destroys.
2MA.3.40	And such was the history of Heliodorus and the keeping of the treasury.
2MA.4.1	But the aforesaid Simon, he who had given information of the money, and 
2MA.4.2	And him that was the benefactor of the city, and the guardian of his fellow countrymen, and a zealot for the laws, he dared to call a conspirator against the state. 
2MA.4.3	But when the growing enmity 
2MA.4.4	Onias, seeing the
2MA.4.5	betook himself to the king, not to be an accuser of his fellow-citizens, but looking to the good of all the
2MA.4.6	for he saw that without the king’s providence it was impossible for the state to obtain peace any more, and that Simon would not cease from his madness.
2MA.4.7	But when Seleucus was deceased, and Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, succeeded to the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias supplanted 
2MA.4.8	having promised to the king at an audience three hundred and threescore talents of silver, and 
2MA.4.9	and beside this, he undertook to assign a hundred and fifty more, if it might be allowed him
2MA.4.10	And when the king had given assent, and he had gotten possession of the office, he forthwith brought over them of his own race to the Greek fashion. 
2MA.4.11	And setting aside the royal ordinances of special favour to the Jews, granted by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who went on the ambassage to the Romans for friendship and alliance, and seeking to overthrow the lawful modes of life, he brought in new customs forbidden by the law: 
2MA.4.12	for he eagerly established a 
2MA.4.13	And thus there was an extreme of hellenization, and an advance of an alien religion, by reason of the exceeding profaneness of Jason, that ungodly man and no high priest; 
2MA.4.14	so that the priests had no more any zeal for the services of the altar: but despising the sanctuary, and neglecting the sacrifices, they hastened to
2MA.4.15	making of no account the honours of their fathers, and thinking the glories of the Greeks best of all. 
2MA.4.16	By reason whereof sore calamity beset them; and the men whose ways of living they earnestly followed, and to whom they desired to be made like in all things, these became their enemies and punished them. 
2MA.4.17	For it is not a light thing to do impiously against the laws of God: but
2MA.4.18	Now when certain games that came every fifth year were kept at Tyre, and the king was present, 
2MA.4.19	the vile Jason sent sacred envoys,
2MA.4.20	And though in the purpose of the sender this 
2MA.4.21	Now when Apollonius the 
2MA.4.22	And being magnificently received by Jason and the city, he was brought in with torches and shouting. This done, he afterward led his army down into Phoenicia.
2MA.4.23	Now after a space of three years Jason sent Menelaus, the aforesaid Simon’s brother, to bear the money to the king, and to
2MA.4.24	But he being commended to the king, and
2MA.4.25	And having received the royal mandates he came 
2MA.4.26	And whereas Jason, who had supplanted his own brother, was supplanted by another and driven as a fugitive into the country of the Ammonites, 
2MA.4.27	Menelaus had possession of the office: but of the money that had been promised to the king nothing
2MA.4.28	(for to him appertained the gathering of the revenues); for which cause they were both called by the king to his presence. 
2MA.4.29	And Menelaus left his own brother Lysimachus for his
2MA.4.30	Now while such was the state of things, it came to pass that they of Tarsus and Mallus made insurrection, because they were to be given as a present to Antiochis, the king’s concubine. 
2MA.4.31	The king therefore came 
2MA.4.32	And Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a favourable opportunity, presented to Andronicus certain vessels of gold belonging to the temple, which he had stolen: other 
2MA.4.33	And when Onias had sure knowledge 
2MA.4.34	Wherefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus apart, prayed him
2MA.4.35	For the which cause not only Jews, but many also of the other nations, had indignation and displeasure at the unjust murder of the man. 
2MA.4.36	And when the king was come back again from the places in Cilicia, the Jews that were
2MA.4.37	Antiochus therefore was heartily sorry, and was moved to pity, and wept, because of the sober and well ordered life of him that was dead; 
2MA.4.38	and being inflamed with passion, forthwith he stripped off Andronicus’s purple robe, and
2MA.4.39	Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and when the report of them was spread abroad outside, the people gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, after many vessels of gold had been already dispersed. 
2MA.4.40	And when the multitudes were rising against 
2MA.4.41	But when they perceived the assault of Lysimachus, some caught up stones, others logs of wood, and some took handfuls of the ashes that lay near, and they flung them all pell-mell upon Lysimachus and those who were with him; 
2MA.4.42	by reason of which they wounded many of them, and some they struck to the ground, and all 
2MA.4.43	But touching these matters there was an accusation laid against Menelaus. 
2MA.4.44	And when the king was come to Tyre, the three men that were sent by the senate pleaded the cause before him. 
2MA.4.45	But Menelaus, seeing himself now defeated, promised much money to Ptolemy the 
2MA.4.46	Whereupon Ptolemy taking the king aside into a cloister, as it were to take the air, brought him to be of another mind: 
2MA.4.47	and him that was the cause of all the evil, Menelaus, he discharged from the accusations; but these hapless men, who, if they had pleaded even before Scythians, would have been discharged uncondemned, them he sentenced to death. 
2MA.4.48	Soon then did those who were spokesmen for the city and the families 
2MA.4.49	For which cause even certain Tyrians, moved with hatred of the wickedness, provided magnificently for their burial. 
2MA.4.50	But Menelaus through the covetous dealings of those who were in power remained still in his office, growing in wickedness,
2MA.5.1	Now about this time Antiochus made his second inroad into Egypt. 
2MA.5.2	And it 
2MA.5.3	and drawing of swords; and 
2MA.5.4	Wherefore all men implored that the
2MA.5.5	But when a false rumour had arisen that Antiochus was deceased, Jason took not less than a thousand men, and suddenly
2MA.5.6	But Jason slaughtered his own citizens without mercy, not considering that good success against kinsmen is the greatest ill success, but supposing himself to be setting up trophies over enemies, and not over fellow-countrymen. 
2MA.5.7	The office 
2MA.5.8	At the last therefore he met with a miserable end: having been
2MA.5.9	and he that had driven many from their own country into strange lands perished 
2MA.5.10	and he that had cast out a multitude unburied had none to mourn for him, nor had he any funeral at all, or place in the sepulchre of his fathers.
2MA.5.11	Now when tidings came to the king concerning that which was done, he thought that Judea was in revolt; whereupon setting out from Egypt in a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms, 
2MA.5.12	and commanded his soldiers to cut down without mercy such as came in their way, and to kill such as went up upon the houses; 
2MA.5.13	and there was killing of young and old, making away of boys, women, and children, slaying of virgins and infants. 
2MA.5.14	And in all the three days 
2MA.5.15	But not content with this he presumed to enter into the most holy temple of all the earth, having Menelaus for his guide (him that had proved himself a traitor both to the laws and to his country), 
2MA.5.16	even taking the sacred vessels with his polluted hands, and dragging down with his profane hands the offerings that had been dedicated by other kings to the augmentation and glory and honour of the place. 
2MA.5.17	And Antiochus was lifted up in mind, not seeing that because of the sins of those who lived in the city the Sovereign Lord had been provoked to anger a little while, and therefore his eye was 
2MA.5.18	But had it not so been that they were already bound by many sins, this man, even as Heliodorus who was sent by Seleucus the king to view the treasury, would, so soon as he pressed forward, have been scourged and turned back from his daring deed. 
2MA.5.19	However the Lord didn’t choose the nation for the place’s sake, but the place for the nation’s sake. 
2MA.5.20	Wherefore also the place itself, having shared in the calamities that befell the nation, did afterward share in 
2MA.5.21	As for Antiochus, when he had carried away out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste to Antioch, thinking in his arrogance to make the land navigable and the sea passable by foot, because his heart was lifted up. 
2MA.5.22	And moreover he left governors to afflict the race: at Jerusalem, Philip, by race a Phrygian, and in character more barbarous than him that set him there; 
2MA.5.23	and at Gerizim, Andronicus; and besides these, Menelaus, who worse than all the rest exalted himself against his fellow-citizens. And having a malicious mind
2MA.5.24	he sent that
2MA.5.25	And he coming to Jerusalem, and playing the man of peace, waited till the holy day of the Sabbath, and finding the Jews at rest from work, he commanded his men to parade in arms. 
2MA.5.26	And he put to the sword all those who came forth to the spectacle; and running into the city with the armed men he killed great multitudes. 
2MA.5.27	But Judas, who is also 
2MA.6.1	And not long after this the king sent forth
2MA.6.2	and also to pollute the sanctuary in Jerusalem, and to call it by the name of
2MA.6.3	But sore and utterly grievous was the visitation of this evil. 
2MA.6.4	For the temple was filled with riot and revellings by the heathen, who
2MA.6.5	and
2MA.6.6	And a man could neither keep the Sabbath, nor observe the feasts of the fathers, nor so much as confess himself to be a Jew. 
2MA.6.7	And on the day of the king’s birth every month they were led along with bitter constraint to eat of the sacrifices; and when the
2MA.6.8	A decree went out to the neighbouring Greek cities, by the suggestion of Ptolemy, that they should observe the same conduct against the Jews, and should make them eat of the sacrifices; 
2MA.6.9	and that they should kill such as didn’t choose to go over to the Greek rites. So the present misery was for all to see: 
2MA.6.10	for two women were brought up for having circumcised their children; and these, when they had led them publicly round about the city, with the babes hung from their breasts, they cast down headlong from the wall. 
2MA.6.11	And others, that had run together into the caves near by to keep the seventh day secretly, being betrayed to Philip were all burnt together, because they scrupled to defend themselves, from regard to the honour of that most solemn day.
2MA.6.12	I beseech therefore those that read this book, that they be not discouraged because of the calamities, but account that these punishments were not for the destruction, but for the chastening of our race. 
2MA.6.13	For indeed that those who act impiously be not let alone any long time, but immediately meet with retribution, is a sign of great beneficence. 
2MA.6.14	For in the case of the other nations the Sovereign Lord does with patience forbear, until that he punish them when they have attained to the full measure of 
2MA.6.15	that he may not take vengeance on us afterward,
2MA.6.16	Wherefore he never withdraws his mercy from us; but though he chastens with calamity, yet does he not forsake his own people. 
2MA.6.17	However let this that we have spoken suffice to put 
2MA.6.18	Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, a man already well stricken in years, and of a noble countenance, was compelled to open his mouth to eat swine’s flesh. 
2MA.6.19	But he, welcoming death with renown rather than life with pollution, advanced of his own accord to the instrument of torture, but first spat forth 
2MA.6.20	 as men ought to come that are resolute to repel such things as not 
2MA.6.21	But those who had the charge of that forbidden sacrificial feast took the man aside, for the acquaintance which of old times they had with him, and privately implored him to bring flesh of his own providing, such as was befitting for him to use, and to make as if he did eat of the flesh from the sacrifice, as had been commanded by the king; 
2MA.6.22	that by so doing he might be delivered from death, and for his ancient friendship with them might be treated kindly. 
2MA.6.23	But he, having formed a high resolve, and one that became his years, and the dignity of old age, and the grey hairs
2MA.6.24	For it becomes not our years to dissemble, 
2MA.6.25	and 
2MA.6.26	For even if for the present time I shall remove from me the punishment of men, yet shall I not escape the hands of the Almighty, either living or dead. 
2MA.6.27	Wherefore, by manfully parting with my life now, I will show myself worthy of my old age, 
2MA.6.28	and
2MA.6.29	 And when they changed the good will they bore towards him a little before into ill will, because these words of his were, as they thought, sheer madness, 
2MA.6.30	and when he was at the point to die with the
2MA.6.31	So this man also died after this manner, leaving his death for an example of nobleness and a memorial of virtue, not only to the young but also to the great body of his nation.
2MA.7.1	And it came to pass that seven kindred also with their mother were at the king’s command taken and shamefully handled with scourges and cords, to compel them to taste of the abominable swine’s flesh. 
2MA.7.2	But one of them made himself the spokesman and said, What would you ask and learn of us? for we are ready to die rather than transgress the laws of our fathers. 
2MA.7.3	And the king fell into a rage, and commanded to heat pans and cauldrons: 
2MA.7.4	and when these forthwith were heated, he commanded to cut out the tongue of him that had been their spokesman, and to scalp him, and to cut off his extremities, the rest of his kindred and his mother looking on. 
2MA.7.5	And when he was utterly
2MA.7.6	The Lord God sees, and in truth is
2MA.7.7	And when the first had died after this manner, they brought the second to the mocking; and they pulled off the skin of his head with the hair and asked him, “Will you eat, before your body is punished in every limb?” 
2MA.7.8	But he answered in the language of his fathers and said to them, “No.” Therefore he also underwent the next torture in succession, as the first had done. 
2MA.7.9	And when he was at the last gasp, he said, “You, miscreant, release us out of this present life, but the King of the world shall raise up us, who have died for his laws, to an eternal renewal of life.”
2MA.7.10	And after him was the third made a mocking-stock. And when he was required, he quickly put out his tongue, and stretched forth his hands courageously, 
2MA.7.11	and nobly said, From heaven I possess these; and for his laws’ sake I treat these with contempt; and from him I hope to receive these back again: 
2MA.7.12	insomuch that the king himself and those who were with him were astonished at the young man’s soul, for that he nothing regarded the pains.
2MA.7.13	And when he too was dead, they shamefully handled and tortured the fourth in like manner. 
2MA.7.14	And being come near to death he said thus: It is good to die at the hands of men and look for the hopes which are 
2MA.7.15	And next after him they brought the fifth, and shamefully handled him. 
2MA.7.16	But he looked towards
2MA.7.17	but hold you on your way, and behold his sovereign majesty, how it will torture you and your seed.
2MA.7.18	And after him they brought the sixth. And when he was at the point to die he said, Be not vainly deceived, for we suffer these things for our own doings, as sinning against our own God: marvellous things are come to pass; 
2MA.7.19	but think not you that you shall be unpunished, having assayed to fight against God.
2MA.7.20	But above all was the mother marvellous and worthy of honourable memory; for when she looked on seven sons perishing within the space of one day, she bare 
2MA.7.21	And she exhorted each one of them in the language of their fathers, filled with a noble temper and stirring up her womanish thought with manly passion, saying to them, 
2MA.7.22	I know not how you° came into my womb, neither was it I that bestowed on you your
2MA.7.23	Therefore the Creator of the world, who fashioned the
2MA.7.24	But Antiochus, thinking himself to be despised, and suspecting the reproachful voice, while the youngest was yet alive didn’t only make his appeal 
2MA.7.25	But when the young man would in no wise give heed, the king called to him his mother, and exhorted her that she would counsel the lad to save himself. 
2MA.7.26	And when he had exhorted her with many words, she undertook to persuade her son. 
2MA.7.27	But bending towards him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, she spoke thus in the language of her fathers: My son, have pity upon me that carried you nine months in my womb, and gave you suck three years, and nourished and brought you up to this age, and sustained you. 
2MA.7.28	I beseech you, my child, to lift your eyes to the heaven and the earth, and to see all things that are in it, and thus to recognise that God made them not of things that were, and 
2MA.7.29	Don’t be afraid of this butcher, but, proving yourself worthy of your kindred, accept your death, that in the mercy 
2MA.7.30	But before she had yet ended speaking, the young man said, Whom wait you° for? I obey not the commandment of the king, but I listen to the commandment of the law that was given to our fathers through Moses. 
2MA.7.31	But you, that have devised all manner of evil against the Hebrews, shall in no wise escape the hands of God. 
2MA.7.32	For we are suffering because of our own sins; 
2MA.7.33	and if for rebuke and chastening our living Lord has been angered a little while, yet shall he again be reconciled with his own servants. 
2MA.7.34	But you, O unholy man and of all most vile, be not vainly lifted up in your wild pride with uncertain hopes, raising your hand against the heavenly children; 
2MA.7.35	For not yet have you escaped the judgement of the Almighty God that sees 
2MA.7.36	For these our kindred, having endured a
2MA.7.37	But I, as my kindred, give up both body and soul for the laws of our fathers, calling upon God that he may speedily become
2MA.7.38	and that in me and my kindred
2MA.7.39	But the king, falling into a rage, handled him worse than all the rest, being exasperated at his mocking. 
2MA.7.40	So he also died pure 
2MA.7.41	And last of all after her sons the mother died.
2MA.7.42	Let it then suffice to have said thus much concerning the 
2MA.8.1	But Judas, who is also 
2MA.8.2	And they called upon the Lord, 
2MA.8.3	and to have pity on the city also that was suffering ruin and ready to be made level with the ground; and to listen to the blood that cried to him; 
2MA.8.4	and to remember also the lawless
2MA.8.5	And when Maccabaeus had trained his men for service, the heathen at once found him irresistible, for that the wrath of the Lord was turned into pity. 
2MA.8.6	 And coming unawares he set fire to cities and villages. And in winning back the most important positions, putting to flight no small number of the enemies, 
2MA.8.7	he especially took advantage of the nights for such assaults. And his courage was loudly talked of everywhere.
2MA.8.8	But when Philip saw the man gaining ground by little and little, and increasing more and more in his prosperity, he wrote to Ptolemy, the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, that he should support the king’s cause. 
2MA.8.9	And 
2MA.8.10	And Nicanor
2MA.8.11	And immediately he sent to the cities upon the sea coast, inviting them to buy Jewish
2MA.8.12	But tidings came to Judas concerning the inroad of Nicanor; and when he communicated to those who were with him the presence of the army, 
2MA.8.13	those who were cowardly and distrustful of the judgement of God
2MA.8.14	And others sold all that was left over to them, and withal implored the Lord to deliver those who had been sold 
2MA.8.15	and 
2MA.8.16	And Maccabaeus gathered his men together, six thousand in number, and exhorted them not to be stricken with dismay at the enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen who came wrongfully against them; but to contend nobly, 
2MA.8.17	setting before their eyes the outrage that had been lawlessly perpetrated upon the holy place, and the shameful handling of the city that had been turned to mockery, and further the overthrow of the mode of life received from their ancestors. 
2MA.8.18	For they, said he, trust to arms, and withal to deeds of daring; but we trust on the almighty God, since he is able at a beck to cast down those who are coming against us, and even the whole world. 
2MA.8.19	And moreover he recounted to them the help given from time to time in the days of their ancestors, both the 
2MA.8.20	and the 
2MA.8.21	And when he had with these words made them of good courage, and ready to die for the laws and their country, he divided his army into four parts; 
2MA.8.22	 appointing his kindred to be with himself leaders of the several bands, 
2MA.8.23	and moreover Eleazer also: 
2MA.8.24	And, since the Almighty fought on their side, they killed of the enemy above nine thousand, and wounded and
2MA.8.25	and they took the money of those that had come there to buy them. And after they had pursued them for some
2MA.8.26	for it was the day before the Sabbath, and for this cause they made no effort to chase them far. 
2MA.8.27	 And when they had gathered
2MA.8.28	And after the Sabbath, when they had given of the spoils to the
2MA.8.29	And when they had accomplished these things, and had made a common supplication, they implored the merciful Lord to be wholly reconciled with his servants.
2MA.8.30	And having had an encounter with the forces of Timotheus and Bacchides, they killed above twenty thousand of them, and made themselves masters of strongholds exceedingly high, and divided very much plunder, giving the
2MA.8.31	 And when they had gathered the arms
2MA.8.32	And they killed the
2MA.8.33	 And as they kept the feast of victory in the
2MA.8.34	And the thrice-accursed Nicanor, who had brought the thousand merchants to buy the Jews 
2MA.8.35	being through the help of the Lord humbled by them who in his eyes were held to be of least account, put off his glorious apparel, and 
2MA.8.36	And he that had taken upon him to make tribute sure for the Romans by the captivity of the men of Jerusalem published abroad that the Jews had One who fought for them, and that
2MA.9.1	Now about that time it befell that Antiochus had returned
2MA.9.2	For he had entered into the city called Persepolis, and he assayed to rob
2MA.9.3	And while he was at Ecbatana, news was brought him what had happened to Nicanor and the forces of Timotheus. 
2MA.9.4	And being lifted up
2MA.9.5	But the All-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him with a
2MA.9.6	and that most justly, for he had tormented other men’s bowels with many and strange sufferings. 
2MA.9.7	But he in no wise ceased from his rude insolence; no, still more was he filled with arrogance, breathing fire in his passion against the Jews, and commanding to haste the journey. But it came to pass moreover that he fell from his chariot as it rushed along, and having a grievous fall was racked in all the members of his body. 
2MA.9.8	And he that but now supposed himself to have the waves of the sea at his bidding, so vainglorious was he beyond the condition of a man, and that thought to weigh the heights of the mountains in a balance, was now brought to the ground and carried in a litter,
2MA.9.9	so that out of the body of the impious man worms swarmed, and while he was still living in anguish and pains, his flesh fell off, and by reason of the stench all the army turned with loathing from his corruption. 
2MA.9.10	And the man that a little before supposed himself to touch the stars of heaven, no one could endure to carry for his intolerable stench. 
2MA.9.11	Therefore he began in great part to cease from his arrogance, being broken 
2MA.9.12	And when he himself could not stand his own smell, he said these words: It is right to be subject to God, and that one who is mortal should not
2MA.9.13	And the vile man vowed to the sovereign Lord, who now no more would have pity upon him, saying on this wise: 
2MA.9.14	that the holy city, to the which he was going in haste, to lay it even with the ground and to
2MA.9.15	and as touching the Jews, whom he had decided not even to count worthy of burial, but to cast them out to the beasts with their infants, for the birds to devour, he would make them all equal to citizens of Athens; 
2MA.9.16	and the holy sanctuary, which before he had plundered, he would adorn with goodliest offerings, and would restore all the sacred vessels many times multiplied, and out of his own revenues would defray the charges that were required for the sacrifices; 
2MA.9.17	and, beside all this, that he would become a Jew, and would visit every inhabited place, publishing abroad the might of God. 
2MA.9.18	But when his sufferings did in no wise cease, for the judgement of God had come upon him in righteousness, having given up all hope of himself, he wrote to the Jews the letter written below, having the nature of a supplication, to this effect:
2MA.9.19	To the worthy Jews, his fellow-citizens, Antiochus, king and general, wishes much joy and health and prosperity. 
2MA.9.20	 May you° and your children fare well; and your affairs shall be to your mind. Having my hope in heaven, 
2MA.9.21	I remembered with affection your honour and good will 
2MA.9.22	not despairing of myself, but having great hope to escape from the sickness. 
2MA.9.23	But considering that my father also, at what time he led an army into the upper country, appointed his successor, 
2MA.9.24	to the end that, if anything fell out contrary to expectation, or if any unwelcome tidings were brought, they 
2MA.9.25	and, beside all this, observing how that the princes that are borderers and neighbours to my kingdom watch opportunities, and look for the future event, I have appointed my son Antiochus 
2MA.9.26	I exhort you therefore and beseech you, having in your remembrance the benefits done to you in common and severally, to preserve each of you your present good will towards me and my son. 
2MA.9.27	For I am persuaded that he in gentleness and kindness will follow my purpose and treat you with indulgence.
2MA.9.28	So the murderer and blasphemer, having endured the most intense sufferings, even as he had dealt with other men, ended his life amongst the mountains by a most piteous fate in a strange land. 
2MA.9.29	And Philip his foster brother conveyed the body 
2MA.10.1	And Maccabaeus and those who were with him, the Lord leading them on, recovered the temple and the city; 
2MA.10.2	and they pulled down the altars that had been built in the marketplace by the aliens, and also 
2MA.10.3	And having cleansed the sanctuary they made another altar of sacrifice; and
2MA.10.4	And when they had done these things, they fell prostrate and implored the Lord that they might fall no more into such evils; but that, if ever they should sin, they might be chastened by him with forbearance, and not be delivered to blaspheming and barbarous heathen. 
2MA.10.5	Now on the same day that the sanctuary was profaned by aliens, upon that very day did it come to pass that the cleansing of the sanctuary was made, even on the five and twentieth day of the same month, which is Chislev. 
2MA.10.6	And they kept eight days with gladness in the manner 
2MA.10.7	Wherefore bearing wands wreathed with leaves, and fair boughs, and palms also, they offered up hymns of thanksgiving to him that had prosperously brought to pass the cleansing of his own place. 
2MA.10.8	They ordained also with a common statute and decree, for all the nation of the Jews, that they should keep these days every year. 
2MA.10.9	And
2MA.10.10	But now will we declare what came to pass under Antiochus 
2MA.10.11	For this man, when he succeeded to the kingdom, appointed one Lysias 
2MA.10.12	For Ptolemy that was called Macron, setting an example of observing justice towards the Jews because of the wrong that had been done to them, endeavored to
2MA.10.13	Whereupon being accused by the 
2MA.10.14	But Gorgias, when he was made governor of the district, maintained a force of mercenaries, and at every turn kept up war with the Jews. 
2MA.10.15	And together with him the Idumaeans also, being masters of important strongholds, harassed the Jews; and receiving to them those that had taken refuge 
2MA.10.16	But Maccabaeus and his men, having made solemn supplication and having implored God to fight on their side, rushed upon the strongholds of the Idumaeans; 
2MA.10.17	and assaulting them vigorously they made themselves masters of the positions, and kept off all that fought upon the wall, and killed those that fell in their way, and killed no fewer than twenty thousand. 
2MA.10.18	And because no less than nine thousand were fled into two towers exceedingly strong and having all things 
2MA.10.19	Maccabaeus, having left Simon and Joseph, and Zacchaeus besides and those who were with him, a force sufficient to besiege them, departed himself to places where he was most needed. 
2MA.10.20	But Simon and those who were with him, yielding to covetousness, were bribed by certain of those that were in the towers, and receiving seventy thousand drachmas let some of them slip away. 
2MA.10.21	But when word was brought to Maccabaeus of what was done, he gathered the leaders of the people together, and accused 
2MA.10.22	So he killed these men for having turned traitors, and forthwith took possession of the two towers. 
2MA.10.23	And prospering with his arms in all things he took in hand, he destroyed in the two strongholds more than twenty thousand.
2MA.10.24	Now Timotheus, who had been before defeated by the Jews, having gathered together foreign forces in great multitudes, and having collected the
2MA.10.25	But as he drew near, Maccabaeus and his men sprinkled earth upon their heads and girded their loins with sackcloth, in supplication to God, 
2MA.10.26	and falling down upon the step in front of the altar, implored him to become
2MA.10.27	And rising from their prayer they took up their arms, and advanced some distance from the city; and when they had come near to their enemies they
2MA.10.28	And when the dawn was now spreading, the two 
2MA.10.29	But when the battle waxed strong, there appeared out of heaven to their adversaries five men on horses with bridles of gold, 
2MA.10.30	and taking Maccabaeus in the midst of them, and covering him with their own armour, guarded him from wounds, while on the adversaries they shot forth arrows and thunderbolts; by reason whereof they were blinded and thrown into confusion, and were cut to pieces, filled with bewilderment. 
2MA.10.31	And there were slain twenty thousand and five hundred, beside six hundred horsemen.
2MA.10.32	But Timotheus himself fled into a stronghold called Gazara, a fortress of exceedingly strength,
2MA.10.33	But Maccabaeus and his men were glad and laid siege to the fortress four and twenty days. 
2MA.10.34	And those who were within, trusting to the strength of the place, blasphemed exceedingly, and hurled forth impious words. 
2MA.10.35	But at dawn of the five and twentieth day certain young men of the company of Maccabaeus, inflamed with passion because of the blasphemies, assaulted the wall with masculine force and with
2MA.10.36	And others climbing up in like manner, while 
2MA.10.37	And they killed Timotheus, who was hidden in a cistern, and his brother Chaereas, and Apollophanes. 
2MA.10.38	And when they had accomplished these things, they blessed the Lord with hymns and thanksgiving, him who does great benefits to Israel, and gives them the victory.
2MA.11.1	Now after a very little time Lysias, the king’s guardian and kinsman and chancellor, being sore displeased for the things that had come to pass, 
2MA.11.2	collected about fourscore thousand 
2MA.11.3	and to levy tribute on the temple, as
2MA.11.4	holding in no account the might of God, but puffed up with his ten thousands of footmen, and his thousands of horsemen, and his fourscore elephants. 
2MA.11.5	And coming into Judea and drawing near to Bethsuron, which was a strong place and distant from Jerusalem about
2MA.11.6	But when Maccabaeus and his men learnt that he was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people with lamentations and tears made supplication to the Lord to send a good angel to save Israel. 
2MA.11.7	And Maccabaeus himself took up arms first, and exhorted the others to put themselves in jeopardy together with him and help their kindred; and they went out with him very willingly. 
2MA.11.8	And as they were there, close to Jerusalem, there appeared at their head one on horseback in white apparel, brandishing
2MA.11.9	And they all together praised the merciful God, and were yet more strengthened in heart: being ready to
2MA.11.10	they advanced in array, having him that is in heaven to fight on their side, for the Lord had mercy on them. 
2MA.11.11	And hurling 
2MA.11.12	But the more part of them escaped wounded 
2MA.11.13	But as he was a man not void of understanding, weighing with himself the defeat which had befallen him, and considering that the Hebrews could not be overcome, because the Almighty God fought on their side, he sent again 
2MA.11.14	and persuaded them to come to terms on condition that all their rights were acknowledged, and
2MA.11.15	And Maccabaeus gave consent upon all the conditions which Lysias proposed to him, being careful of the 
2MA.11.16	For the letters written to the Jews from Lysias were to this effect:
2MA.11.16	Lysias to the
2MA.11.17	John and Absalom, who were sent from you, having delivered the
2MA.11.18	Whatever things therefore had need to be brought before the king I declared 
2MA.11.19	If then you° will preserve your good will towards the state, henceforward I will also endeavour to contribute to 
2MA.11.20	 And on this behalf I have given order in detail, both to these men and to those 
2MA.11.21	Fare you° well. 
2MA.11.22	And the king’s letter was in these words:
2MA.11.22	King Antiochus to his brother Lysias, greeting. 
2MA.11.23	Seeing that our father passed to the gods having the wish that the subjects of his kingdom
2MA.11.24	we, having heard that the Jews do not consent to our father’s purpose to turn them to the 
2MA.11.25	choosing therefore that this nation also should be free from
2MA.11.26	You will therefore do well to send 
2MA.11.27	And to the nation the king’s letter was after this manner:
2MA.11.27	King Antiochus to the senate of the Jews and to the other Jews, greeting. 
2MA.11.28	If you° fare well, we have our desire: we ourselves also are in good health. 
2MA.11.29	Menelaus informed us that your desire was to return home and follow your own business. 
2MA.11.30	They therefore that depart home up to the thirtieth day of Xanthicus shall have 
2MA.11.31	that the Jews use their own 
2MA.11.32	Moreover I have sent Menelaus also, that he may encourage you. 
2MA.11.33	Fare you° well. 
2MA.11.34	And the Romans also sent to them a letter in these words:
2MA.11.34	Quintus Memmius 
2MA.11.35	In regard to the things which Lysias the king’s kinsman granted you, we also give consent. 
2MA.11.36	But as for the things which he judged should be referred to the king, send one forthwith, after you° have advised thereof, that we may publish such 
2MA.11.37	Wherefore send some with speed, that we also may learn what is your mind. 
2MA.11.38	 Farewell. 
2MA.12.1	So when these covenants had been made, Lysias departed to the king, and the Jews went about their husbandry. 
2MA.12.2	But 
2MA.12.3	And men of Joppa perpetrated this great impiety: they invited the Jews that lived amongst them to go with their wives and children into the boats which they had provided, as though they had no ill will towards them; 
2MA.12.4	and when
2MA.12.5	But when Judas heard of the cruelty done to his fellow-countrymen, giving command to the men that were with him 
2MA.12.6	and calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came against the murderers of his kindred, and set the haven on fire by night, and burnt the boats, and put to the sword those that had fled there. 
2MA.12.7	But when the town was closed 
2MA.12.8	But learning that the men of Jamnia were minded to do in like manner to the Jews that sojourned amongst them, 
2MA.12.9	he fell upon the Jamnites also by night, and set fire to the haven together with the fleet, so that the glare of the light was seen at Jerusalem, two hundred and forty furlongs distant.
2MA.12.10	Now when they had drawn off nine furlongs from thence, as they marched against Timotheus, 
2MA.12.11	And when a sore battle had been fought, and Judas and his company by the help of God had good success, the nomads being overcome implored Judas to grant them friendship, promising to give 
2MA.12.12	So Judas, thinking that they would indeed be profitable in many things, agreed to live in peace with them; and receiving pledges of friendship they departed to their tents. 
2MA.12.13	And he also fell upon a certain city
2MA.12.14	But those who were within, trusting to the strength of the walls and to their store of provisions, behaved themselves rudely towards Judas and those who were with him, railing, and furthermore blaspheming and speaking impious words. 
2MA.12.15	But Judas and his company, calling upon the great sovereign of the world, who without rams and cunning engines of war hurled down Jericho in the times of Joshua, rushed wildly against the wall; 
2MA.12.16	and having taken the city by the will of God, they made unspeakable slaughter, insomuch that the adjoining lake, which was two furlongs broad, appeared to be filled with the deluge of blood.
2MA.12.17	And when they had drawn off seven hundred and fifty furlongs from thence, they made their way to Charax, to the Jews that are called
2MA.12.18	And Timotheus they found not in occupation of that district, for he had then departed from the district without accomplishing anything, but had left behind a garrison, and that a very strong one, in a certain post. 
2MA.12.19	But Dositheus and Sosipater, who were of Maccabaeus’s captains, went out and destroyed those that had been left by Timotheus in the stronghold, above ten thousand men. 
2MA.12.20	And Maccabaeus, ranging his own army by bands, set
2MA.12.21	But when Timotheus heard of the inroad of Judas, he at once sent away the women and the children and also the baggage into the 
2MA.12.22	But when the band of Judas, who led the van, appeared in sight, and when terror came upon the enemy and fear, because the manifestation of him who sees all things came upon them, they fled amain, carried this way and that, so that they were often hurt of their own men, and pierced with the points of their swords. 
2MA.12.23	And Judas continued the pursuit the more hotly, putting the wicked wretches to the sword, and he destroyed as many as thirty thousand men. 
2MA.12.24	But Timotheus himself, falling in with the company of Dositheus and Sosipater, implored them with much crafty guile to let him go with his life, because he had 
2MA.12.25	So when he had with many words confirmed the agreement to restore them without hurt, they let him go that they might save their kindred.
2MA.12.26	And 
2MA.12.27	And after he had put these to flight and destroyed them, he marched against Ephron also, a strong city,
2MA.12.28	But calling upon the Sovereign who with might breaks in pieces the
2MA.12.29	And setting out from thence they marched in haste against Scythopolis, which is distant from Jerusalem six hundred furlongs. 
2MA.12.30	But when the Jews that were settled there testified of the good will that the Scythopolitans had shown towards them, and of their kindly bearing 
2MA.12.31	they gave thanks, and further exhorted them to remain well affected towards the race for the future; and they went up to Jerusalem, the feast of weeks being close to hand.
2MA.12.32	But after the 
2MA.12.33	and he came out with three thousand footmen and four hundred horsemen. 
2MA.12.34	And when they had set themselves in array, it came to pass that a few of the Jews fell. 
2MA.12.35	And a certain Dositheus, one
2MA.12.36	And when those who were with Esdris had been fighting long and were wearied out, Judas called upon the Lord to show himself, fighting on their side and leading the van of the battle; 
2MA.12.37	and 
2MA.12.38	And Judas gathering his army came to the city of
2MA.12.39	And on the day following,
2MA.12.40	But under the garments of each one of the dead they found
2MA.12.41	All therefore, blessing the 
2MA.12.42	betook themselves to supplication, beseeching that the sin committed might be wholly blotted out. And the noble Judas exhorted the multitude to keep themselves from sin, forsomuch as they had seen before their eyes what things had come to pass because of the sin of those who had fallen. 
2MA.12.43	And when he had made a collection man by man to the sum of two thousand drachmas of silver, he sent to Jerusalem to offer a sacrifice for sin, doing therein right well and honourably, in that he took thought for a resurrection. 
2MA.12.44	For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it were superfluous and idle to pray for the dead. 
2MA.12.45	(And if 
2MA.13.1	In the hundred and forty and ninth year tidings were brought to Judas and his company that Antiochus Eupator was coming with 
2MA.13.2	and with him Lysias his guardian and chancellor,
2MA.13.3	And Menelaus also joined himself with them, and with great dissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not for the saving of his country, but because he thought that he would be set over the government. 
2MA.13.4	But the King of kings stirred up the
2MA.13.5	Now there is in that place a tower of fifty cubits high, full of ashes, and it had all round it a
2MA.13.6	Here him that is guilty of sacrilege, or has attained a preeminence in any other evil deeds, they
2MA.13.7	By such a fate it befell the breaker of the law, Menelaus, to die, without obtaining so much as 
2MA.13.8	for inasmuch as he had perpetrated many sins
2MA.13.9	Now the king,
2MA.13.10	But when Judas heard of these things, he gave charge to the multitude to call upon the Lord day and night, 
2MA.13.11	and not to suffer the people that had been but now a little while revived to fall into the hands of those profane heathen. 
2MA.13.12	So when they had all done the same thing together,
2MA.13.13	And having gone apart with the elders he resolved that, before the king’s army should enter into Judea and make themselves masters of the city, they should go forth and try the matter 
2MA.13.14	And committing the decision to the

2MA.13.16	And at last they filled the
2MA.13.17	And this had been accomplished when the day was but now dawning, because of the Lord’s protection that gave
2MA.13.18	But the king, having had a taste of the exceeding boldness of the Jews, made attempts by stratagem upon their positions, 
2MA.13.19	and 
2MA.13.20	And Judas conveyed such things as were necessary to those who were within. 
2MA.13.21	But Rhodocus, from the Jewish ranks, made known to the enemy the secrets 
2MA.13.22	The king treated with them in Bethsura the second time, gave his hand, took theirs, departed, attacked the forces of Judas, was put to the worse, 
2MA.13.23	heard that Philip who had been left as chancellor in Antioch had become reckless, was confounded, made to the Jews an overture 
2MA.13.24	showed kindness and graciously received Maccabaeus, left Hegemonides governor from Ptolemais even to the
2MA.13.25	came to Ptolemais. The men of Ptolemais were displeased at the treaty, for they had exceedingly great indignation 
2MA.13.26	Lysias
2MA.14.1	Now after a space of three years tidings were brought to Judas and his company that Demetrius the 
2MA.14.2	had gotten possession of the country, having made away with Antiochus and Lysias his guardian.
2MA.14.3	But one Alcimus, who had formerly been high priest, and had wilfully polluted himself in the times when there was no mingling 
2MA.14.4	came to king Demetrius in about the hundred and fifty first year, presenting to him a crown of gold and a palm, and beside these some of the festal olive boughs of the temple. And for that day he held his peace; 
2MA.14.5	but having gotten opportunity to further his own madness, being called by Demetrius into a meeting of his council, and asked how the Jews stood affected and what they purposed, he answered thereto. 
2MA.14.6	Those of the Jews that he called
2MA.14.7	Wherefore, having laid aside my ancestral glory, I mean the high priesthood, I am now come
2MA.14.8	first for the unfeigned care I have for the things that concern the king, and secondly because I have regard also to my own fellow-citizens: for, through the unadvised dealing of those of whom I spoke before, our whole race is in no small misfortune. 
2MA.14.9	But do you, O king, having informed yourself of these things severally, take thought both for our country and for our race, which
2MA.14.10	For as long as Judas remains alive, it is impossible that the state should find peace. 
2MA.14.11	And when he had spoken such words as these, at once
2MA.14.12	And forthwith appointing Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants, and making him governor of Judea, he sent him forth, 
2MA.14.13	giving him written instructions to make away with Judas himself and to scatter those who were with him, and to set up Alcimus as high priest of the
2MA.14.14	And
2MA.14.15	But when 
2MA.14.16	 And when the leader had given 
2MA.14.17	But Simon, the brother of Judas, had encountered Nicanor,
2MA.14.18	Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of those who were with Judas, and their courage in fighting for their country, shrank from bringing the matter to the decision of the sword. 
2MA.14.19	Wherefore he sent Posidonius and Theodotus and Mattathias to give and receive pledges of friendship. 
2MA.14.20	So when these proposals had been long considered, and the leader had made the
2MA.14.21	And they appointed a day on which to meet together by themselves. And a litter was borne forward from each 
2MA.14.22	Judas stationed armed men ready in convenient places, lest perhaps there should suddenly be treachery on the part of the enemy; they held such conference as was meet. 
2MA.14.23	Nicanor waited in Jerusalem, and did nothing to cause disturbance, but dismissed the flocks of people that had gathered together. 
2MA.14.24	And he kept Judas always in his presence; he had gained a hearty affection for the man; 
2MA.14.25	he urged him to marry and beget children; he married, settled quietly, took part in common life.
2MA.14.26	But Alcimus, perceiving the good will that was between them,
2MA.14.27	And the king, falling into a rage, and being exasperated by the false accusations of that most wicked man, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that he was displeased at the covenants, and commanding him to send Maccabaeus prisoner to Antioch in all haste. 
2MA.14.28	And when this message came to Nicanor, he was confounded, and was sore troubled at the thought of annulling the articles that had been agreed upon, the man having done no wrong; 
2MA.14.29	but because there was no dealing against the king, he watched his time to execute this purpose by stratagem. 
2MA.14.30	But Maccabaeus, when he perceived that Nicanor was behaving more harshly in his dealings with him, and that he had become ruler in his customary bearing, understanding that this harshness came not of good, gathered together not a few of his men, and concealed himself from Nicanor.
2MA.14.31	But the other,
2MA.14.32	And when they declared with oaths that they had no knowledge where the man was whom he sought, 
2MA.14.33	he stretched forth his right hand towards the sanctuary, and sware this oath: If you° will not deliver up to me Judas as a prisoner, I will lay this
2MA.14.34	And having said this, he departed. But the priests, stretching forth their hands towards heaven, called upon him that ever fights for our nation, in these words: 
2MA.14.35	You,
2MA.14.36	so now, O holy Lord of all hallowing, keep undefiled forever this house that has been lately cleansed.
2MA.14.37	Now information was given to Nicanor against one Razis, an elder of Jerusalem,
2MA.14.38	For in the former times when there was no mingling 
2MA.14.39	And Nicanor, wishing to make evident the ill will that he bare to the Jews, sent above five hundred soldiers to take him; 
2MA.14.40	for he thought by taking him to inflict a calamity upon them. 
2MA.14.41	But when the
2MA.14.42	choosing rather to die nobly than to fall into the hands of the wicked wretches, and suffer outrage unworthy of his own nobleness: 
2MA.14.43	but since he missed his stroke through the excitement of the struggle, and the crowds were now rushing within the door, he ran bravely up to the wall and cast himself down manfully amongst the crowds. 
2MA.14.44	But as they quickly gave back, a space was made, and he fell on the middle of
2MA.14.45	And having yet breath within him, and being inflamed with passion, he rose up, and though his blood gushed out in streams and his wounds were grievous, he ran through the crowds, and standing upon a steep rock, 
2MA.14.46	when as his blood was now well near spent, he drew forth his bowels 
2MA.15.1	But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in the region of Samaria, resolved to set upon them with all security on the day of rest. 
2MA.15.2	And when the Jews that were compelled to follow him said, O destroy not so savagely and barbarously, but give due glory to the day which he that sees all things has
2MA.15.3	then the thrice-accursed wretch asked if there were a Sovereign in heaven that had commanded to keep the Sabbath day. 
2MA.15.4	And when they declared, There is the Lord, living himself a Sovereign in heaven, who bade 
2MA.15.5	then says the other, I also am a sovereign upon the earth,
2MA.15.6	And Nicanor,
2MA.15.7	but Maccabaeus still trusted unceasingly, with all hope that he should obtain help from the Lord. 
2MA.15.8	And he exhorted his company not to be fearful at the
2MA.15.9	and comforting them out of the law and the prophets, and withal putting them in mind of the conflicts that they had maintained, he made them more eager 
2MA.15.10	And when he had roused their
2MA.15.11	And arming each one of them, not so much with the sure defence of shields and spears as with the encouragement 
2MA.15.12	And the vision of that 
2MA.15.13	thereupon 
2MA.15.14	and Onias answered and said, This is the lover of the kindred, he who prays much for the people and the holy city, Jeremiah the prophet of God: 
2MA.15.15	and Jeremiah stretching forth his right hand delivered to Judas a sword of gold, and in giving it addressed 
2MA.15.16	Take the holy sword, a gift from God, wherewith you shall strike down the adversaries.
2MA.15.17	And being encouraged by the words of Judas, which were of a lofty strain, and able to incite to virtue and to stir the souls of the young to manly courage, they determined
2MA.15.18	For their fear for wives and children, and furthermore for kindred and kinsfolk, was in less account with them; but greatest and first was their fear for the consecrated sanctuary. 
2MA.15.19	And they also that were shut up in the city were in no light distress, being troubled because of the encounter in the open ground.
2MA.15.20	And when all were now waiting for the decision of the issue, and the enemy had already joined battle, and the army had been set in array, and the
2MA.15.21	Maccabaeus, perceiving the presence of the
2MA.15.22	And calling upon 
2MA.15.23	so now also, O Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel before us to bring terror and trembling: 
2MA.15.24	through the greatness of your arm let them be stricken with dismay that with blasphemy are come here against your holy people. And as he ended with these words, 
2MA.15.25	Nicanor and his company advanced with trumpets and victory songs; 
2MA.15.26	but Judas and his company joined battle with the enemy with invocation and prayers. 
2MA.15.27	And contending with their hands, and praying to God with their hearts, they killed no less than thirty five thousand men, being made exceedingly glad by the manifestation of God.
2MA.15.28	And when the engagement was over, and they were returning again with joy, they recognised Nicanor lying dead in full armour; 
2MA.15.29	and there arose a shout and
2MA.15.30	And he that in all things was in body and soul the foremost champion of his fellow-citizens, he that kept through life the good will of his youth towards his countrymen, commanded to cut off Nicanor’s head, and his hand with the shoulder, and bring them to Jerusalem. 
2MA.15.31	And when he had arrived there, and had called his countrymen together and set the priests before the altar, he sent for those who were in the citadel; 
2MA.15.32	and showing the head of the vile Nicanor, and the hand of that profane man, which with proud brags he had stretched out against the holy house of the Almighty, 
2MA.15.33	and cutting out the tongue of the impious Nicanor, he said that he would give
2MA.15.34	And they all 
2MA.15.35	And he hanged Nicanor’s head and shoulder from the citadel, a sign, evident to all and manifest, of the help of the Lord. 
2MA.15.36	And they all ordained with a common decree in no wise to let this day pass undistinguished, but to mark with honour the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (it is called Adar in the Syrian tongue), the day before the day of Mordecai.
2MA.15.37	THIS then having been the issue of the attempt of Nicanor, and the city having from those times been held by the Hebrews, I also will here make an end of my book. 
2MA.15.38	And if 
2MA.15.39	For as it is
2MA.15.39	And here shall be the end.
1ES.1.2	having set the priests according to their daily courses, being arrayed in their vestments, in the temple of the Lord. 
1ES.1.3	And he spoke to the Levites,
1ES.1.4	 You° shall no more have need to bear it upon your shoulders: now therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister to his people Israel, and prepare you after your fathers’ houses and kindred, 
1ES.1.5	according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son: and standing in the holy place according to the several divisions of the families of you the Levites, who 
1ES.1.6	offer the Passover in order, and make ready the sacrifices for your kindred, and keep the Passover according to the commandment of the Lord, which was given to Moses. 
1ES.1.7	And to the people which were present Josias gave thirty thousand lambs and kids, 
1ES.1.8	And Helkias, and Zacharias, and
1ES.1.9	And Jeconias, and Samaias and Nathanael his brother, and Sabias, and Ochielus, and Joram, captains over thousands, gave to the Levites for the Passover five thousand sheep, 
1ES.1.10	And when these things were done, the priests and Levites, having the unleavened bread, stood in comely order according to the kindred, 
1ES.1.11	and according to the several divisions by fathers’ houses, before the people, to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses: and thus 
1ES.1.12	And they roasted the Passover with fire, as appertains: and the sacrifices they sod in the brazen vessels and cauldrons with a good savour, 
1ES.1.13	and set them before all the people: and afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests their kindred, the sons of Aaron. 
1ES.1.14	For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests their kindred, the sons of Aaron. 
1ES.1.15	The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in their order, according to the appointment of David, 
1ES.1.16	Moreover the gatekeepers were at every gate; none had need to depart from his daily course: for their kindred the Levites prepared for them. 
1ES.1.17	Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord accomplished in that day, in holding the Passover, 
1ES.1.18	and offering sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of King Josias. 
1ES.1.19	So the children of Israel which were present at that time held the Passover, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 
1ES.1.20	And such a Passover was not held in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel. 
1ES.1.21	Yes, all the kings of Israel held not such a Passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that were present in their dwelling place at Jerusalem. 
1ES.1.22	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this Passover held. 
1ES.1.23	And the works of Josias were upright before his Lord with a heart full of godliness. 
1ES.1.24	Moreover the things that came to pass in his days have been written in times past, concerning those that sinned, and did wickedly against the Lord above every people and kingdom, and how they grieved him
1ES.1.26	But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Judea? 
1ES.1.27	I am not sent out from the Lord God against you; for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yes, the Lord is with me hastening me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord. 
1ES.1.28	However Josias didn’t turn back
1ES.1.29	but joined battle with him in the plain of Megiddo, and the princes came down against King Josias. 
1ES.1.30	Then said the king to his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servants carried him away out of the army. 
1ES.1.31	Then got he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. 
1ES.1.32	And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias; and Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women made lamentation for him, to this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel. 
1ES.1.33	These things are written in the book of the histories of the kings of Judea, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now 
1ES.1.35	And he reigned in
1ES.1.36	And he set a tax upon the people of a hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. 
1ES.1.37	The king of Egypt also made King Joakim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem. 
1ES.1.38	And Joakim bound the nobles: but Zarakes his brother he apprehended, and brought him up out of Egypt. 
1ES.1.39	Five and twenty years old was 
1ES.1.40	And against him Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came up, and bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him to Babylon. 
1ES.1.41	Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and set them up in his own temple at Babylon. 
1ES.1.42	But those things that are reported of him, and of his uncleanness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings. 
1ES.1.43	And Joakim his son reigned in his stead: for when he was made king he was
1ES.1.44	and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did that which was evil before the Lord.
1ES.1.45	So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought to Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord; 
1ES.1.46	and made Sedekias king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he was one and twenty years old; and he reigned eleven years: 
1ES.1.47	and he also did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the words that were spoken by Jeremy the prophet from the mouth of the Lord. 
1ES.1.48	And after king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he forswore himself, and rebelled; and hardening his neck, and his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord, the God of Israel. 
1ES.1.49	Moreover the governors of the people and of the priests did many things wickedly,
1ES.1.50	And the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he had compassion on them and on his dwelling place. 
1ES.1.51	But they mocked his messengers; and in the day when the Lord spoke 
1ES.1.52	so far forth, that he, being angry with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded to bring up the kings of the Chaldeans against them; 
1ES.1.53	who killed their young men with the sword, round about their holy temple, and spared neither young man nor maid, old man nor child; but he delivered all into their hands. 
1ES.1.54	And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with
1ES.1.55	And they burnt the house of the Lord, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem, and burnt the towers thereof with fire: 
1ES.1.56	and as for her glorious things, they never ceased till they had brought them all to nothing: and the people that were not slain with the sword he carried to Babylon: 
1ES.1.57	and they were servants to him and to his children, till the Persians reigned, to fulfil the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremy: 
1ES.1.58	Until the land has enjoyed her Sabbaths, the whole time of her desolation shall she keep Sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.
1ES.2.1	In the 
1ES.2.2	the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and he made proclamation through all his kingdom, and also by writing, 
1ES.2.3	saying, Cyrus king of the Persians says: The Lord of Israel, the Most High Lord, has made me king of the whole world, 
1ES.2.4	and commanded me to build him a house at Jerusalem that is in Judea. 
1ES.2.5	If therefore there be any of you that are of his people,
1ES.2.6	Of such therefore as dwell in various places, let those who are in his own place help each one with gold, and with silver, 
1ES.2.7	with gifts, with horses also and cattle, beside the other things which have been added by vow for the temple of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.
1ES.2.8	Then the chief of the families of Judah and of the tribe of Benjamin stood up; the priests also, and the Levites, and all they whose spirit the Lord had stirred to go up, to build the house for the Lord which is in Jerusalem. 
1ES.2.9	And those who lived round about them helped them in all things with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with very many gifts that were vowed of a great number whose minds were stirred up 
1ES.2.10	King Cyrus also brought forth the holy vessels of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem, and had set up in his temple of idols. 
1ES.2.11	Now when Cyrus king of the Persians had brought them forth, he delivered them to Mithradates his treasurer, 
1ES.2.12	and by him they were delivered to
1ES.2.13	And this was the number of them: A thousand golden cups, a thousand cups of silver, censers of silver twenty nine, vials of gold thirty, and of silver two thousand and four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. 
1ES.2.14	So all the vessels of gold and of silver were brought up, even five thousand and four hundred threescore and nine, 
1ES.2.15	and were carried back by Sanabassar, together with them of the captivity, from Babylon to Jerusalem.
1ES.2.17	To king Artaxerxes our Lord, Your servants, Rathumus the recorder, and Samellius the scribe, and the rest of their council, and the judges that are in Coelesyria and Phoenicia. 
1ES.2.18	Be it now known to our lord the king, that the Jews that have come up from you to us, having come to Jerusalem, are building that rebellious and wicked city, and are repairing its marketplaces and walls, and are laying the foundation of a temple. 
1ES.2.19	Now if this city is built and the walls 
1ES.2.20	And forasmuch as the things pertaining to the temple are now in hand, we think it meet not to neglect such a matter, 
1ES.2.21	but to speak to our lord the king, to the intent that, if it be your pleasure, search may be made in the books of your fathers: 
1ES.2.22	and you shall find in the chronicles what is written concerning these things, and shall understand that that city was rebellious, troubling both kings and cities: 
1ES.2.23	and that the Jews were rebellious, and raised always wars therein of old time; for the which cause even this city was laid waste. 
1ES.2.24	Wherefore now we do declare to you, O lord the king, that if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up anew, you shall from henceforth have no passage into Coelesyria and Phoenicia. 
1ES.2.25	Then the king wrote back again to Rathumus the recorder, and Beeltethmus, and Samellius the scribe, and to the rest that were in commission, and lived in Samaria and Syria and Phoenicia, after this manner: 
1ES.2.26	I have read the letter which you° have sent to me: therefore I commanded to make search, and it has been found that that city of old time has made insurrection against kings; 
1ES.2.27	and the men were given to rebellion and war therein: and that mighty kings and fierce were in Jerusalem, who reigned and exacted tribute in Coelesyria and Phoenicia. 
1ES.2.28	Now therefore I have commanded to hinder those men from building the city, and heed to be taken that there be nothing done contrary to this 
1ES.2.29	and that those wicked doings proceed no further to the annoyance of kings. 
1ES.2.30	Then king Artaxerxes, his letters being read, Rathumus, and Samellius the scribe, and the rest that were in commission with them, removing in haste to Jerusalem with horsemen and a multitude of people in battle array, began to hinder the builders; and the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.
1ES.3.1	Now king Darius made a great feast to all his subjects, and to all that were born in his house, and to all the princes of Media and of Persia, 
1ES.3.2	and to all the local governors and captains and governors that were under him, from India to Ethiopia, in the hundred and twenty and seven provinces. 
1ES.3.3	And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and awaked out of his sleep.
1ES.3.4	Then the three young men of the body-guard, that kept the king’s person, spoke one to another: 
1ES.3.5	Let every one of us say one thing which shall be strongest: and he whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, to him shall Darius the king give great gifts, and great honours in token of victory: 
1ES.3.6	as, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and a turban of fine linen, and a chain about his neck: 
1ES.3.7	and he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin. 
1ES.3.8	And then they wrote every one his sentence, and set to their seals, and laid 
1ES.3.9	and said, When the king is risen, some shall give him the writing; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as it is written. 
1ES.3.10	The first wrote, Wine is the strongest. 
1ES.3.11	The second wrote, The king is strongest. 
1ES.3.12	The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth bears away the victory.
1ES.3.13	Now when the king was risen up, they took the writing, and gave it to him, and so he read it: 
1ES.3.14	and sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and of Media, and the local governors, and the captains, and the governors, and the chief officers; 
1ES.3.15	and sat him down in the royal seat of judgement; and the writing was read before them. 
1ES.3.16	And he said, Call the young men, and they shall explain their own sentences. So they were called, and came in. 
1ES.3.17	And they said to them, Declare to us your mind concerning the things you° have written.
1ES.3.17	Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine, 
1ES.3.18	and said thus, O sirs, how exceedingly strong is wine! it causes all men to err that drink it: 
1ES.3.19	it makes the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich: 
1ES.3.20	it turns also every thought into cheer and mirth, so that a man remembers neither sorrow nor debt: 
1ES.3.21	and it makes every heart rich, so that a man remembers neither king nor local governor; and it makes to speak all things by talents: 
1ES.3.22	and when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and kindred, and a little after draw their swords: 
1ES.3.23	but when they awake from their wine, they remember not what they have done. 
1ES.3.24	O sirs, is not wine the strongest, seeing that it enforces to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace.
1ES.4.1	Then the second, that had spoken of the strength of the king, began to say, 
1ES.4.2	O sirs, do not men excel in strength, that bear rule over the sea and land, and all things in them? 
1ES.4.3	But yet is the king stronger: and he is their lord, and has dominion over them; and in whatever he commands them they obey him. 
1ES.4.4	If he bid them make war the one against the other, they do it: and if he send them out against the enemies, they go, and overcome mountains, walls, and towers. 
1ES.4.5	They kill and are slain, and transgress not the king’s commandment: if they get the victory, they bring all to the king, as well the plunder, as all things else. 
1ES.4.6	Likewise for those that are no soldiers, and have not to do with wars, but use husbandry, when they have reaped again that which they had sown, they bring it to the king, and compel one another to pay tribute to the king. 
1ES.4.7	And he is
1ES.4.8	if he command to strike, they strike; if he command to make desolate, they make desolate; if he command to build, they build; 
1ES.4.9	if he command to cut down, they cut down; if he command to plant, they plant. 
1ES.4.10	So all his people and his armies obey him: furthermore he lies down, he eats and drinks, and takes his rest: 
1ES.4.11	and these keep watch round about him, neither may any one depart, and do his own business, neither disobey they him 
1ES.4.12	O sirs, how should not the king be strongest, seeing that in such sort he is obeyed? And he held his peace.
1ES.4.13	Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of truth, (this was Zorobabel) began to speak. 
1ES.4.14	O sirs, is not the king great, and men are many, and wine is strong? who is it then that rules them, or has the lordship over them? are they not women? 
1ES.4.15	Women have borne the king and all the people that bear rule by sea and land. 
1ES.4.16	Even of them came they: and they nourished them up that planted the vineyards, from whence the wine comes. 
1ES.4.17	These also make garments for men; these bring glory to men; and without women can’t men be. 
1ES.4.18	Yes, and if men have gathered together gold and silver and any other goodly thing,
1ES.4.19	they let all those things go, and gape after her, and even with open mouth fix their eyes fast on her; and have all more desire to her than to gold or silver, or any goodly thing whatever. 
1ES.4.20	A man leaves his own father that brought him up, and his own country, and joins with his wife. 
1ES.4.21	And with his wife he ends his days, and remembers neither father, nor mother, nor country. 
1ES.4.22	By this also you° must know that women have dominion over you: do you° not labour and toil, and give and bring all to women? 
1ES.4.23	Yes, a man takes his sword, and goes forth to make outroads, and to rob and to steal, and to sail upon the sea and upon rivers; 
1ES.4.24	and looks upon a lion, and walks in the darkness; and when he has stolen, plundered, and robbed, he brings it to his love. 
1ES.4.25	Wherefore a man loves his wife better than father or mother. 
1ES.4.26	Yes, many there be that have run out of their wits for women, and become bondmen for their sakes. 
1ES.4.27	Many also have perished, have stumbled, and sinned, for women. 
1ES.4.28	And now do you° not believe me? is not the king great in his power? do not all regions fear to touch him? 
1ES.4.29	Yet did I see him and Apame the king’s concubine, the daughter of the illustrious Barticus, sitting at the right hand of the king, 
1ES.4.30	and taking the crown from the king’s head, and setting it upon her own head; yes, she struck the king with her left hand: 
1ES.4.31	and therewithal the king gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth: if she laughed upon him, he laughed also: but if she took any displeasure at him, he was fain to flatter, that she might be reconciled to him again. 
1ES.4.32	O sirs, how can it be but women should be strong, seeing they do thus?
1ES.4.33	Then the king and the nobles looked one upon another: so he began to speak concerning truth. 
1ES.4.34	O sirs, are not women strong? great is the earth, high is the heaven, swift is the sun in his course, for he encircles the heavens round about, and fetches his course again to his own place in one day. 
1ES.4.35	Is he not great that makes these things? therefore great is truth, and stronger than all things. 
1ES.4.36	All the earth calls upon truth, and the heaven blesses her: all works shake and tremble, but with
1ES.4.37	Wine is unrighteous, the king is unrighteous, women are unrighteous, all the children of men are unrighteous, and unrighteous are all such their works; and there is no truth in them; in their unrighteousness also they shall perish. 
1ES.4.38	But truth remains, and is strong forever; she lives and conquers forevermore. 
1ES.4.39	With her there is no accepting of persons or rewards; but she does the things that are just, 
1ES.4.40	Neither in her judgement is any unrighteousness; and she is the strength, and the kingdom, and the power, and the majesty, of all ages. Blessed be the God of truth. 
1ES.4.41	And with that he held his tongue. And all the people then shouted, and said, Great is truth, and strong above all things.
1ES.4.42	Then said the king to him, Ask what you will more than is appointed in writing, and we will give it you, inasmuch as you are found wisest; and you shall sit next me, and shall be called my cousin. 
1ES.4.43	Then said he to the king, Remember your vow, which you did vow to build Jerusalem, in the day when you came to your kingdom, 
1ES.4.44	and to send away all the vessels that were taken out of Jerusalem, which Cyrus set apart, when he vowed to destroy Babylon, and vowed to send them again there. 
1ES.4.45	You did also vow to build up the temple, which the Edomites burnt when Judea was made desolate by the Chaldeans. 
1ES.4.46	And now, O lord the king, this is that which I require, and which I desire of you, and this is the princely generosity that shall proceed from you: I pray therefore that you make good the vow, the performance whereof you have vowed to the King of heaven with your own mouth.
1ES.4.47	Then Darius the king stood up, and kissed him, and wrote letters for him to all the treasurers and governors and captains and local governors, that they should safely bring on their way both him, and all those that should go up with him to build Jerusalem. 
1ES.4.48	He wrote letters also to all the governors that were in Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and to them in Libanus, that they should bring cedar wood from Libanus to Jerusalem, and that they should build the city with him. 
1ES.4.49	Moreover he wrote for all the Jews that should go out of his realm up into Jewry, concerning their freedom, that no officer, no governor, no local governor, nor treasurer, should forcibly enter into their doors; 
1ES.4.50	and that all the country which they occupied should be free to them without tribute; and that the Edomites should give over the villages of the Jews which then they held: 
1ES.4.51	and that there should be yearly given twenty talents to the building of the temple, until the time that it were built; 
1ES.4.52	and other ten talents yearly, for burnt offerings to be presented upon the altar every day, as they had a commandment to offer seventeen: 
1ES.4.53	and that all those who should come from Babylonia to build the city should have their freedom, as well they as their posterity, and all the priests that came. 
1ES.4.54	He wrote also 
1ES.4.55	and for the Levites he wrote that their charges should be given them until the day that the house were finished, and Jerusalem built up. 
1ES.4.56	And he commanded to give to all that kept the city lands and wages. 
1ES.4.57	He sent away also all the vessels from Babylon, that Cyrus had set apart; and all that Cyrus had given in commandment, he charged also to be done, and sent to Jerusalem.
1ES.4.58	Now when this young man was gone forth, he lifted up his face to heaven towards Jerusalem, and praised the King of heaven, 
1ES.4.59	and said, From you comes victory, from you comes wisdom, and your is the glory, and I am your servant. 
1ES.4.60	Blessed are you, who have given me wisdom: and to you I give thanks, O Lord of our fathers. 
1ES.4.61	And so he took the letters, and went out, and came to Babylon, and told it all his kindred. 
1ES.4.62	And they praised the God of their fathers, because he had given them freedom and liberty 
1ES.4.63	to go up, and to build Jerusalem, and the temple which is called by his name: and they feasted with instruments of music and gladness seven days.
1ES.5.1	After this were the chiefs of fathers’ houses chosen to go up according to their tribes, with their wives and sons and daughters, with their menservants and maidservants, and their cattle. 
1ES.5.2	And Darius sent with them a thousand horsemen, till they had brought them back to Jerusalem
1ES.5.3	And all their kindred played, and he made them go up together with them.
1ES.5.4	And these are the names of the men which went up, according to their families amongst their tribes, after their several divisions. 
1ES.5.5	The priests, the sons of Phinees, the sons of Aaron: Jesus the son of Josedek, the son of Saraias, and Joakim the son of Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, of the house of David, of the lineage of Phares, of the tribe of Judah; 
1ES.5.6	who spoke wise sentences before Darius the king of Persia in the second year of his reign, in the month Nisan, which is the first month. 
1ES.5.7	 And these are they of Jewry that came up from the captivity, where they lived as strangers, whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon. 
1ES.5.8	And they returned to Jerusalem, and to the other parts of Jewry, every man to his own city, who came with Zorobabel, with Jesus, Nehemias, 
1ES.5.9	The number of them of the nation, and their leaders: the sons of
1ES.5.10	the sons of
1ES.5.11	the sons of
1ES.5.12	the sons of Elam, a thousand and two hundred and fifty and four: the sons of
1ES.5.13	the sons of Bebai, six hundred and twenty and three: the sons of
1ES.5.14	the sons of Adonikam, six hundred and sixty and seven: the sons of
1ES.5.15	the sons of
1ES.5.16	the sons of
1ES.5.17	the sons of Baiterus, three thousand and five: the sons of
1ES.5.18	they of Netophas, fifty and five: they of Anathoth, a hundred and fifty and eight: they of
1ES.5.19	they of
1ES.5.20	the Chadiasai and Ammidioi, four hundred and twenty and two: they of
1ES.5.21	they of
1ES.5.22	the sons of
1ES.5.23	the sons of
1ES.5.24	The priests: the sons of
1ES.5.25	the sons of
1ES.5.26	The Levites: the sons of Jesus, and Kadmiel, and Bannas, and Sudias, seventy and four. 
1ES.5.27	The holy singers: the sons of Asaph, a hundred
1ES.5.28	The gatekeepers: the sons of
1ES.5.29	The temple servants: the sons of
1ES.5.30	the sons of
1ES.5.31	the sons of
1ES.5.32	the sons of
1ES.5.33	The sons of the servants of Solomon: the sons of
1ES.5.34	the sons of
1ES.5.35	All the temple-servants, and the sons of the servants of Solomon, were three hundred and seventy and two. 
1ES.5.36	These came up from
1ES.5.37	and they could not show their families, nor their stock, how they were of Israel: the sons of
1ES.5.38	And of the priests, those who usurped the office of the priesthood and were not found: the sons of
1ES.5.39	And when the description of the kindred of these men was sought in the register, and was not found, they were removed from executing the office of the priesthood: 
1ES.5.40	for to them said Nehemias and Attharias, that they should not be partakers of the holy things, till there arose up a high priest wearing
1ES.5.41	So all they of Israel, from twelve years old 
1ES.5.42	Their menservants and handmaids were seven thousand and three hundred and thirty and seven: the minstrels and singers, two hundred and forty and five: 
1ES.5.43	four hundred and thirty and five camels, seven
1ES.5.44	And certain of the chief men of their families, when they came to the temple of God that is in Jerusalem, vowed to set up the house again in its own place according to their ability, 
1ES.5.45	and to give into the holy treasury of the works a thousand pounds of gold, five thousand of silver, and a hundred priestly vestments. 
1ES.5.46	And the priests and the Levites and those who were of the people lived in Jerusalem and the country; the holy singers also and the gatekeepers and all Israel in their villages.
1ES.5.47	But when the seventh month was at hand, and when the children of Israel were every man in his own place, they came all together with one consent into the broad place before the first porch which is towards the east. 
1ES.5.48	Then stood up Jesus the son of Josedek, and his kindred the priests, and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his kindred, and made ready the altar of the God of Israel, 
1ES.5.49	to offer burnt sacrifices upon it, according as it is expressly commanded in the book of Moses the man of God. 
1ES.5.50	And certain were gathered to them out of the other nations of the land, and they erected the altar upon its own place, because all the nations of the land were at enmity with them, and oppressed them; and they offered sacrifices according to the time, and burnt offerings to the Lord both morning and evening. 
1ES.5.51	Also they held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commanded in the law, and 
1ES.5.52	and after that, the continual oblations, and the sacrifices of the Sabbaths, and of the new moons, and of all the consecrated feasts. 
1ES.5.53	And all those who had made any vow to God began to offer sacrifices to God from the new moon of the
1ES.5.54	And they gave money to the masons and carpenters; and meat and drink, 
1ES.5.55	and cars to them of Sidon and Tyre, that they should bring cedar trees from Libanus, 
1ES.5.56	And in the second year after his coming to the temple of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedek, and their kindred, and the Levitical priests, and all those who were come to Jerusalem out of the captivity: 
1ES.5.57	and they laid the foundation of the temple of God on the new moon of the second month, in the second year after they were come to Jewry and Jerusalem. 
1ES.5.58	 And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord. Then stood up Jesus, and his sons and kindred, and Kadmiel his brother, and the sons of Jesus, Emadabun, and the sons of Joda the son of Iliadun, and their sons and kindred, all the Levites, with one accord started the business, labouring to advance the works in the house of God. So the builders built the temple of the Lord. 
1ES.5.59	And the priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musical instruments and trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with their cymbals, 
1ES.5.60	singing songs of thanksgiving, and praising the Lord, after the order of David king of Israel. 
1ES.5.61	And they sang aloud, praising the Lord in songs of thanksgiving, because his goodness and his glory are forever in all Israel. 
1ES.5.62	And all the people sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loud voice, singing songs of thanksgiving to the Lord for the rearing up of the house of the Lord. 
1ES.5.63	 Also of the Levitical priests, and of the heads of their families, the ancients who had seen the former house came to the building of this with lamentation and great weeping. 
1ES.5.64	But many with trumpets and joy 
1ES.5.65	insomuch that the people heard not the trumpets for the weeping of the people: for the multitude sounded marvellously, so that it was heard afar off.
1ES.5.67	And they perceived that those who were of the captivity did build the temple to the Lord, the God of Israel. 
1ES.5.68	So they went to Zorobabel and Jesus, and to the chief men of the families, and said to them, we will build together with you. 
1ES.5.69	For we likewise, as you°, do obey your Lord, and do sacrifice to him from the days of
1ES.5.70	Then Zorobabel and Jesus and the chief men of the families of Israel said to them, It is not
1ES.5.71	We ourselves alone will build to the Lord of Israel, according as Cyrus the king of the Persians has commanded us. 
1ES.5.72	But the heathen of the land lying heavy upon the inhabitants of Judea, and
1ES.5.73	and
1ES.6.1	Now 
1ES.6.2	Then stood up Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedek, and began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, the prophets of the Lord being with them, 
1ES.6.3	 At the same time came to them
1ES.6.4	By whose appointment do you° build this house and this roof, and perform all the other things? and who are the builders that perform these things? 
1ES.6.5	Nevertheless the elders of the Jews obtained favour, because the Lord had visited the captivity; 
1ES.6.6	and they were not hindered from building, until such time as communication was made to Darius concerning them, and his answer signified.
1ES.6.7	The copy of the letter which Sisinnes, governor of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, with their companions, the rulers in Syria and Phoenicia, wrote and sent to Darius; 
1ES.6.8	To king Darius, greeting: Let all things be known to our lord the king, that being come into the country of Judea, and entered into the city of Jerusalem, we found in the city of Jerusalem the elders of the Jews that were of the captivity 
1ES.6.9	building a house to the Lord, great 
1ES.6.10	And those works are done with great speed, and the work goes on prosperously in their hands, and with all glory and diligence it is accomplished. 
1ES.6.11	Then asked we these elders, saying, By whose commandment build you° this house, and lay the foundations of these works? 
1ES.6.12	Therefore, to the intent that we might give knowledge to you by writing who were the chief doers, we questioned them, and we required of them the names in writing of their principal men. 
1ES.6.13	So they gave us this answer, We are the servants of the Lord which made heaven and earth. 
1ES.6.14	And as for this house, it was built many years ago by a king of Israel great and strong, and was finished. 
1ES.6.15	But when our fathers sinned against the Lord of Israel which is in heaven, and provoked him to wrath, he gave them over into the hands of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, king of the Chaldeans; 
1ES.6.16	and they pulled down the house, and burnt it, and carried away the people captives to Babylon. 
1ES.6.17	But in the first year that Cyrus reigned over the country of Babylon, king Cyrus wrote to build up this house. 
1ES.6.18	And the holy vessels of gold and of silver, that Nabuchodonosor had carried away out of the house at Jerusalem, and had set up in his own temple, those Cyrus the king brought forth again out of the temple in Babylonia, and they were delivered to Zorobabel and to
1ES.6.19	with commandment that he should carry away
1ES.6.20	Then Sanabassarus, being come here, laid the foundations of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem; and from that time to this being still a building, it is not yet fully ended. 
1ES.6.21	Now therefore, if it seem good, O king, let search be made amongst the royal archives of our lord the king that are in Babylon: 
1ES.6.22	and if it be found that the building of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem has been done with the consent of king Cyrus, and it seem good to our lord the king, let him signify to us thereof.
1ES.6.24	In the first year of the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commanded to build up the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem, where they do sacrifice with continual fire: 
1ES.6.25	whose height shall be sixty cubits, and the breadth sixty cubits, with three rows of hewn stones, and one row of new wood of that country; and the expenses thereof to be given out of the house of king Cyrus: 
1ES.6.26	and that the holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both gold and silver, that Nabuchodonosor took out of the house at Jerusalem, and carried away to Babylon, should be restored to the house at Jerusalem, and be set in the place where they were before. 
1ES.6.27	And also he commanded that Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, and their companions, and those which were appointed rulers in Syria and Phoenicia, should be careful not to meddle with the place, but suffer Zorobabel, the servant of the Lord, and governor of Judea, and the elders of the Jews, to build that house of the Lord in its place. 
1ES.6.28	And I also do command to have it built up whole again; and that they look diligently to help those that be of the captivity of Judea, till the house of the Lord be finished: 
1ES.6.29	and that out of the tribute of Coelesyria and Phoenicia a portion be carefully given these men for the sacrifices of the Lord, 
1ES.6.30	and also corn, salt, wine and oil, and that continually every year without further question, according as the priests that be in Jerusalem shall signify to be daily spent: 
1ES.6.31	that drink offerings may be made to the Most High God for the king and for his children, and that they may pray for their lives. 
1ES.6.32	And that commandment be given that whoever shall transgress, yes, or neglect anything
1ES.6.33	The Lord therefore, whose name is there called upon, utterly destroy every king and nation, that shall stretch out his hand to hinder or endamage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem. 
1ES.6.34	I Darius the king have ordained that according to these things it be done with diligence.
1ES.7.1	Then 
1ES.7.2	did very carefully oversee the holy works, assisting the elders of the Jews and rulers of the temple. 
1ES.7.3	And so the holy works prospered, while Aggaeus and Zacharias the prophets prophesied. 
1ES.7.4	And they finished these things by the commandment of the Lord, the God of Israel, and with the consent of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of the Persians. 
1ES.7.5	 was
1ES.7.6	And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the other that were of the captivity, that were added 
1ES.7.7	And to the dedication of the temple of the Lord they offered a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; 
1ES.7.8	 twelve he-goats for the sin of all Israel, according to the number of the twelve
1ES.7.9	The priests also and the Levites stood arrayed in their vestments, according to their kindred, for the services of the Lord, the God of Israel, according to the book of Moses: and the gatekeepers at every gate.
1ES.7.10	And the children of Israel that came out of the captivity held the Passover the fourteenth day of the first month, when the priests and the Levites were sanctified together, 
1ES.7.11	 and all those who were of the captivity; for they were sanctified. For the Levites were all sanctified together, 
1ES.7.12	and they offered the Passover for all them of the captivity, and for their kindred the priests, and for themselves. 
1ES.7.13	And the children of Israel that came out of the captivity did eat, even all those who had separated themselves from the abominations of the heathen of the land, and sought the Lord. 
1ES.7.14	And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, making merry before the Lord, 
1ES.7.15	for that he had turned the counsel of the king of Assyria towards them, to strengthen their hands in the works of the Lord, the God of Israel.
1ES.8.2	the son of Sadduk, the son of Ahitob, the son of Amarias, the son of Ozias,
1ES.8.3	This Esdras went up from Babylon, as being a ready scribe in the law of Moses, that was given by the God of Israel. 
1ES.8.4	And the king did him honour: for he found grace in his sight in all his requests. 
1ES.8.5	There went up with him also certain of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and Levites, and holy singers, and gatekeepers, and
1ES.8.6	in the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes, in the fifth month, this was the king’s seventh year; for they went from Babylon on the new moon of the first month, and came to Jerusalem, according to the prosperous journey which the Lord gave them
1ES.8.7	For Esdras had very great skill, so that he omitted nothing of the law and commandments of the Lord, 
1ES.8.8	Now the commission, which was written from Artaxerxes the king, came to Esdras the priest and reader of the law of the Lord, whereof this that follows is a copy; 
1ES.8.9	King Artaxerxes to Esdras the priest and reader of the law of the Lord, greeting: 
1ES.8.10	Having determined to deal graciously, I have given order, that such of the nation of the Jews, and of the priests and Levites,
1ES.8.11	As many therefore as have a mind 
1ES.8.12	that they may look to the affairs of Judea and Jerusalem, agreeably to that which is in the law of the Lord, 
1ES.8.13	and carry the gifts to the Lord of Israel to Jerusalem, which I and my friends have vowed; and that all the gold and silver that can be found in the country of Babylonia for the Lord in Jerusalem, 
1ES.8.14	with that also which is given of the people for the temple of the Lord their God that is at Jerusalem, be collected: even the gold and silver for bullocks, rams, and lambs, and things thereto appertaining; 
1ES.8.15	to the end that they may offer sacrifices to the Lord upon the altar of the Lord their God, which is in Jerusalem. 
1ES.8.16	And whatever you and your kindred are minded to do with gold and silver, that perform, according to the will of your God. 
1ES.8.17	And the holy vessels of the Lord, which are given you for the use of the temple of your God, which is in Jerusalem: 
1ES.8.18	and whatever thing else you shall remember for the use of the temple of your God, you shall give it out of the king’s treasury. 
1ES.8.19	And I king Artaxerxes have also commanded the keepers of the treasures in Syria and Phoenicia, that whatever Esdras the priest and reader of the law of the Most High God shall send for, they should give it him with all diligence, 
1ES.8.20	to the sum of a hundred talents of silver, likewise also of wheat even to a hundred
1ES.8.21	Let all things be performed after the law of God diligently to the most high God, that wrath come not upon the kingdom of the king and his sons. 
1ES.8.22	I command you also, that no tax, nor any other imposition, be laid upon any of the priests, or Levites, or holy singers, or gatekeepers, or temple servants, or any that have employment in this temple, and that no man have authority to impose anything upon them. 
1ES.8.23	And you, Esdras, according to the wisdom of God ordain judges and justices, that they may judge in all Syria and Phoenicia all those that know the law of your God; and those that know it not you shall teach. 
1ES.8.24	And whoever shall transgress the law of your God, and of the king, shall be punished diligently, whether it be by death, or other punishment, by penalty of money, or by
1ES.8.25	Then said Esdras the scribe, Blessed be the only Lord, the God of my fathers, who has put these things into the heart of the king, to glorify his house that is in Jerusalem: 
1ES.8.26	and has honoured me in the sight of the king, and his counsellors, and all his friends and nobles. 
1ES.8.27	Therefore was I encouraged by the help of the Lord my God, and gathered together out of Israel men to go up with me. 
1ES.8.28	And these are the chief according to their families and the several divisions thereof, that went up with me from Babylon in the reign of king Artaxerxes: 
1ES.8.29	of the sons of Phinees, Gerson: of the sons of Ithamar, Gamael: of the sons of David,
1ES.8.30	of the sons of Phoros, Zacharais; and with him were counted a hundred and fifty men: 
1ES.8.31	of the sons of Phaath Moab, Eliaonias the son of
1ES.8.32	 of the sons of Zathoes, Sechenias the son of Jezelus, and with him
1ES.8.33	of the sons of Elam, Jesias son of 
1ES.8.34	of the sons of Saphatias, 
1ES.8.35	of the sons of Joab, 
1ES.8.36	 of the sons of Banias, Salimoth son of Josaphias, and with him a hundred and threescore men: 
1ES.8.37	of the sons of Babi, Zacharias son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight men: 
1ES.8.38	of the sons of 
1ES.8.39	of the sons of Adonikam, the last, and these are the names of them, Eliphalat, Jeuel, and 
1ES.8.40	of the sons of 
1ES.8.41	And I gathered them together to the river called Theras; and there we pitched our tents three days, and I surveyed them. 
1ES.8.42	But when I had found there none of the priests and Levites, 
1ES.8.43	then sent I to Eleazar, and 
1ES.8.44	and Elnathan, and Samaias, and 
1ES.8.45	And I bade those who they should go to 
1ES.8.46	and commanded them that they should speak to Loddeus, and to his kindred, and to the treasurers in that place, to send us such men as might execute the priests’ office in the house of our Lord. 
1ES.8.47	And by the mighty hand of our Lord they brought to us
1ES.8.48	and
1ES.8.49	and of the temple-servants whom David and the principal men had appointed for the servants of the Levites, two hundred and twenty temple-servants, the catalogue of all their names was showed. 
1ES.8.50	And there I vowed a fast for the young men before our Lord, to desire of him a prosperous journey both for us and for our children and cattle that were with us: 
1ES.8.51	for I was ashamed to ask of the king footmen, and horsemen, and conduct for protection against our adversaries. 
1ES.8.52	For we had said to the king, that the power of our Lord would be with those who seek him, to support them in all ways. 
1ES.8.53	And again we implored our lord as touching these things, and found him favourable 
1ES.8.54	Then I separated twelve men of the chiefs of the priests,
1ES.8.55	and I weighed them the silver, and the gold, and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which the king, and his counsellors, and the nobles, and all Israel, had given. 
1ES.8.56	And when I had weighed it, I delivered to them six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of a hundred talents, and a hundred talents of gold, 
1ES.8.57	and twenty golden vessels, and twelve vessels of brass, even of fine brass, glittering like gold. 
1ES.8.58	And I said to them, Both you° are holy to the Lord,
1ES.8.59	Watch you°, and keep them till you° deliver them to the chiefs of the priests and Levites, and to the principal men of the families of Israel, in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of our Lord. 
1ES.8.60	So the priests and the Levites, who received the silver and the gold and the vessels which were in Jerusalem, brought them into the temple of the Lord.
1ES.8.61	And from the river Theras we departed the twelfth day of the first month, until we came to Jerusalem, by the mighty hand of our Lord which was upon us: and the Lord delivered us from 
1ES.8.62	And when we had been there three days, the silver and gold was weighed and delivered in the house of our Lord on the fourth day to
1ES.8.63	And with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them were Josabdus the son of Jesus and
1ES.8.64	And all the weight of them was written up the same hour. 
1ES.8.65	Moreover those who were come out of the captivity offered sacrifices to the Lord, the God of Israel, even twelve bullocks for all Israel, fourscore and sixteen rams, 
1ES.8.66	threescore and twelve lambs, goats for a peace offering, twelve; all of them a sacrifice to the Lord. 
1ES.8.67	And they delivered the king’s commandments to the king’s stewards, and to the governors of Coelesyria and Phoenicia; and they honoured the people and the temple of the Lord.
1ES.8.68	Now when these things were done, the principal men came to me, and said, 
1ES.8.69	The nation of Israel, and the princes, and the priests and the Levites, have not put away 
1ES.8.70	For both they and their sons have married with their daughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the strange people of the land; and from the beginning of this matter the rulers and the nobles have been partakers of this iniquity. 
1ES.8.71	And as soon as I had heard these things, I tore my clothes, and my holy garment, and plucked the hair from off my head and beard, and sat me down sad and full of heaviness. 
1ES.8.72	So all those who were moved at the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, assembled to me, while I mourned for the iniquity: but I sat still full of heaviness until the evening sacrifice. 
1ES.8.73	Then rising up from the fast with my clothes and my holy garment tore, and bowing my knees, and stretching forth my hands to the Lord, 
1ES.8.74	I said, O Lord, I am ashamed and confounded before your face; 
1ES.8.75	for our sins are multiplied above our heads, and our errors have reached up to heaven, 
1ES.8.76	ever since the time of our fathers; and we are in great sin, even to this day. 
1ES.8.77	And for our sins and our fathers’ we with our kindred and our kings and our priests were given up to the kings of the earth, to the sword, and to captivity, and for a prey with shame, to this day. 
1ES.8.78	And now in some measure has mercy been showed to us from you, O Lord, that there should be left us a root and a name in the place of your sanctuary; 
1ES.8.79	and to discover to us a light in the house of the Lord our God, 
1ES.8.80	Yes, when we were in bondage, we were not forsaken of our Lord; but he made us gracious before the kings of Persia, so that they gave us food, 
1ES.8.81	and glorified the temple of our Lord, and raised up the desolate Sion, to give us a sure dwelling in Jewry and Jerusalem. 
1ES.8.82	And now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? For we have transgressed your commandments, which you gave by the hand of your servants the prophets, saying, 
1ES.8.83	That the land, which you° enter into to possess as a heritage, is a land polluted with the pollutions of the strangers of the land, and they have filled it with their uncleanness. 
1ES.8.84	Therefore now shall you° not join your daughters to their sons, neither shall you° take their daughters to your sons. 
1ES.8.85	Neither shall you° seek to have peace with them forever, that you° may be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and that you° may leave it for an inheritance to your children for evermore. 
1ES.8.86	And all that is befallen is done to us for our wicked works and great sins: for you, O Lord, did make our sins light, 
1ES.8.87	and did give to us such a root: 
1ES.8.88	 You was not angry with us to destroy us, till you had left us neither root, seed, nor name. 
1ES.8.89	O Lord of Israel, you are true: for we are left a root this day. 
1ES.8.90	Behold, now are we before you in our iniquities, for we can’t stand any longer before you by reason of these things.
1ES.8.92	Then Jechonias the son of Jeelus, one of the sons of Israel, called out, and said, O Esdras, we have sinned against the Lord God, we have married strange women of the heathen of the land, and now is all Israel
1ES.8.93	Let’s make an oath to the Lord herein, that we will put away all our wives, which 
1ES.8.94	like as seems good to you, and to as many as do obey the Law of the Lord. 
1ES.8.95	Arise, and put in execution: for to you does this matter appertain, and we will be with you to do valiantly. 
1ES.8.96	So Esdras arose, and took an oath of the chief of the priests and Levites of all Israel to do after these things; and 
1ES.9.2	and lodged there, and did eat no bread nor drink water, mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude. 
1ES.9.3	And there was made proclamation in all Jewry and Jerusalem to all those who were of the captivity, that they should be gathered together at Jerusalem: 
1ES.9.4	and that whoever met not there within two or three days, according as the elders that bare rule appointed, their cattle should be seized to the use of the temple, and himself cast out from the multitude of those who were of the captivity.
1ES.9.5	And in three days were all they of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem: this was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. 
1ES.9.6	And all the multitude sat together trembling in the broad place before the temple because of the present foul weather. 
1ES.9.7	So Esdras arose up and said to them, you° have transgressed the law and married strange wives to increase the sins of Israel. 
1ES.9.8	And now make confession and give glory to the Lord, the God of our fathers, 
1ES.9.9	and do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen of the land, and from the strange women. 
1ES.9.10	Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice, Just as you have spoken, so will we do. 
1ES.9.11	But forasmuch as the multitude is great, and it is foul weather, so that we can’t stand without, and this is not a work of one day or two, seeing our sin in these things is spread far: 
1ES.9.12	therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let all them of our habitations that have strange wives come at the time appointed, 
1ES.9.13	and with them the rulers and judges of every place, till we turn away the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter. 
1ES.9.14	 Jonathan the son of Azael and
1ES.9.15	And those who were of the captivity did according to all these things.
1ES.9.16	And Esdras the priest chose to him principal men of their families, all by name: and on the new moon of the tenth month they were shut in together to examine the matter. 
1ES.9.17	So their cause that held strange wives was brought to an end by the new moon of the first month. 
1ES.9.18	And of the priests that were come together, and had strange wives, there were found; 
1ES.9.19	of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedek, and his kindred;
1ES.9.20	And they gave their hands to put away their wives, and 
1ES.9.21	And of the sons of Emmer; Ananias, and Zabdeus, and
1ES.9.22	And of the sons of
1ES.9.23	And of the Levites; Jozabdus, and Semeis, and
1ES.9.24	Of the holy singers;
1ES.9.25	Of the gatekeepers: Sallumus, and
1ES.9.26	Of Israel, of the sons of
1ES.9.27	Of the sons of Ela; Matthanias, Zacharias, and
1ES.9.28	And of the sons of
1ES.9.29	Of the sons of Bebai; Joannes, and Ananias, and
1ES.9.30	Of the sons of
1ES.9.31	And of the sons of Addi; Naathus, and Moossias, Laccunus, and Naidus, and Matthanias, and Sesthel, Balnuus, and Manasseas. 
1ES.9.32	And of the sons of Annas; Elionas, and Aseas, and Melchias, and Sabbeus, and Simon Chosameus. 
1ES.9.33	And of the sons of Asom;
1ES.9.34	And of the sons of Baani; Jeremias, Momdis, Ismaerus, Juel, Mamdai, and Pedias, and Anos, Carabasion, and Enasibus, and Mamnitamenus, Eliasis, Bannus, Eliali, Someis, Selemias, Nathanias: and of the sons of Ezora; Sesis, Ezril, Azaelus, Samatus, Zambri, Josephus. 
1ES.9.35	And of the sons of Nooma; Mazitias, Zabadeas, Edos, Juel, Banaias. 
1ES.9.36	All these had taken strange wives, and they put them away with their children. 
1ES.9.37	And the priests and Levites, and those who were of Israel, lived in Jerusalem, and in the country, on the new moon of the seventh month, and the children of Israel in their habitations.
1ES.9.39	and they said to Esdras the priest and reader, Bring the law of Moses, that was given of the Lord, the God of Israel. 
1ES.9.40	So Esdras the chief priest brought the law to the whole multitude both of men and women, and to all the priests, to hear the law on the new moon of the seventh month. 
1ES.9.41	And he read in the broad place before the porch of the temple from morning to mid-day, before both men and women; and
1ES.9.42	And Esdras the priest and reader of the law stood up upon the pulpit of wood, which was made 
1ES.9.43	And there stood up by him Mattathias, Sammus, Ananias, Azarias, Urias,
1ES.9.44	and upon his left hand,
1ES.9.45	Then took Esdras the book of the law before the multitude, and sat honourably in the first place before all. 
1ES.9.46	And when he opened the law, they stood all straight up. So Esdras blessed the Lord God Most High, the God of armies, Almighty. 
1ES.9.47	And all the people answered, Amen; and lifting up their hands they fell to the ground, and worshipped the Lord. 
1ES.9.48	Also Jesus, Annus, Sarabias, Iadinus, Jacubus, Sabateus,
1ES.9.49	Then said Attharates to Esdras the chief priest and reader, and to the Levites that taught the multitude, even to all, 
1ES.9.50	This day is holy to the Lord; (now they all wept when they heard the law:) 
1ES.9.51	go then, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to those who have nothing; 
1ES.9.52	for the day is holy to the Lord: and be not sorrowful; for the Lord will bring you to honour. 
1ES.9.53	So the Levites published all things to the people, saying, This day is holy; be not sorrowful. 
1ES.9.54	Then they went their way, every one to eat and drink, and make merry, and to give portions to those who had nothing, and to make great cheer; 
1ES.9.55	because they
2ES.1.1	The second book of the prophet Esdras, the son of Saraias, the son of Azaraias, the son of Helkias, the son of Salemas, the son of Sadoc, the son of Ahitob, 
2ES.1.2	the son of Achias, the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, the son of Amarias, the son of Aziei, the son of Marimoth, the son of Arna, the son of Ozias, the son of Borith, the son of Abissei, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, 
2ES.1.3	the son of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi; which was captive in the land of the Medes, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of the Persians.
2ES.1.4	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
2ES.1.5	Go your way, and show my people their sinful deeds, and their children their wickedness which they have done against me; that they may tell their children’s children: 
2ES.1.6	because the sins of their fathers are increased in them: for they have forgotten me, and have done sacrifice to strange gods. 
2ES.1.7	Did I not bring them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage? but they have provoked me to wrath, and have despised my counsels. 
2ES.1.8	Shake you then the hair of your head, and cast all evils upon them, for they have not been obedient to my law, but it is a rebellious people. 
2ES.1.9	How long shall I forbear them, to whom I have done so much good? 
2ES.1.10	I have overthrown many kings for their sakes; I have struck down Pharoah with his servants and all his army. 
2ES.1.11	I have destroyed all the nations before them, and in the east I have scattered the people of two provinces, even of Tyre and Sidon, and have slain all their adversaries. 
2ES.1.12	Speak therefore to them, saying,
2ES.1.13	The Lord says, of a truth I brought you through the sea, and where there was no path I made for you highways; I gave you Moses for a leader, and Aaron for a priest. 
2ES.1.14	I gave you light in a pillar of fire, and great wonders have I done amongst you; yet have you° forgotten me, says the Lord.
2ES.1.15	The Lord Almighty says, The quails were for a token to you; I gave you a camp for your protection, nevertheless you° murmured there: 
2ES.1.16	and you° triumphed not in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but ever to this day do you° yet murmur. 
2ES.1.17	Where are the benefits that I have done for you? when you° were hungry and thirsty in the wilderness, did you° not cry to me, 
2ES.1.18	saying, Why have you brought us into this wilderness to kill us? it had been better for us to have served the Egyptians, than to die in this wilderness. 
2ES.1.19	I had pity upon your mourning, and gave you manna for food; you° did eat angels’ bread. 
2ES.1.20	When you° were thirsty, did I not cleave the rock, and waters flowed out to your fill? for the heat I covered you with the leaves of the trees. 
2ES.1.21	I divided amongst you fruitful lands; I cast out the Canaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines, before you: what shall I yet do more for you? says the Lord.
2ES.1.22	The Lord Almighty says, When you° were in the wilderness, at the bitter river, being thirsty, and blaspheming my name, 
2ES.1.23	I gave you not fire for your blasphemies, but cast a tree in the water, and made the river sweet. 
2ES.1.24	What shall I do to you, O Jacob? you, Judah, would not obey me: I will turn me to other nations, and I will give my name to them, that they may keep my statutes. 
2ES.1.25	Seeing you° have forsaken me, I also will forsake you; when you° ask me to be merciful to you, I will have no mercy upon you. 
2ES.1.26	Whenever you° shall call upon me, I will not hear you: for you° have defiled your hands with blood, and your feet are swift to commit manslaughter. 
2ES.1.27	You° have not as it were forsaken me, but your own selves, says the Lord.
2ES.1.28	The Lord Almighty says, Have I not prayed you as a father his sons, as a mother her daughters, and a nurse her young babes, 
2ES.1.29	that you° would be my people, and I should be your God; that you° would be my children, and I should be your father? 
2ES.1.30	I gathered you together, as a hen 
2ES.1.31	When you° offer oblations to me, I will turn my face from you: for your solemn feast days, your new moons, and your circumcisions of the flesh, have I rejected. 
2ES.1.32	I sent to you my servants the prophets, whom you° have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require 
2ES.1.33	The Lord Almighty says, Your house is desolate, I will cast you out as the wind does stubble. 
2ES.1.34	And your children shall not be fruitful; for they have neglected my commandment
2ES.1.35	I will give your houses to a people that will come; which not having heard of me yet believe me; they to whom I have showed no signs shall do that which I have commanded. 
2ES.1.36	They have seen no prophets, yet they shall call their former estate to remembrance. 
2ES.1.37	I take to witness the grace of the people that shall come, whose little ones rejoice with gladness: and though they see me not with bodily eyes, yet in spirit they shall believe the thing that I say.
2ES.1.38	And now, O father, behold with glory; and see the people that come from the east: 
2ES.1.39	to whom I will give for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel, Abdias, and Jonas, 
2ES.1.40	Nahum, and Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggaeus, Zachary, and Malachy, which is called also the angel of the Lord.
2ES.2.1	The Lord says, I brought this people out of bondage, and I gave them my commandments by my servants the prophets; whom they would not hear, but set my counsels at nothing. 
2ES.2.2	The mother that bare them says to them, go your way, O my children; for I am a widow and forsaken. 
2ES.2.3	I brought you up with gladness, and with sorrow and heaviness have I lost you: for you° have sinned before the Lord God, and done that which is evil before me. 
2ES.2.4	But what shall I now do to you? for I am a widow and forsaken: go your way, O my children, and ask mercy of the Lord. 
2ES.2.5	As for me, O father, I call upon you for a witness over the mother of 
2ES.2.6	that you bring them to confusion, and their mother to a plunder, that there may be no offspring of them. 
2ES.2.7	Let them be scattered abroad amongst the heathen, let their names be blotted out of the earth: for they have despised my
2ES.2.8	Woe to you, Assur, you that hide the unrighteous with you! O you wicked nation, remember what I did to Sodom and Gomorrah; 
2ES.2.9	whose land lies in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: even so I will also do to those who have not listened to me, says the Lord Almighty.
2ES.2.10	The Lord says to Esdras, Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I would have given to Israel. 
2ES.2.11	I will also take their glory me, and give these the everlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared for them. 
2ES.2.12	They shall have the tree of life for an ointment of sweet savour; they shall neither labour, nor be weary. 
2ES.2.13	 Ask, and you° shall receive: pray for few days to you, that they may be shortened: the kingdom is already prepared for you: watch. 
2ES.2.14	Take heaven and earth to witness, take them to witness; for I have given up the evil, and created the good: for I live, says the Lord.
2ES.2.15	Mother, embrace your children; I will bring them out with gladness like a dove; establish their feet; for I have chosen you, says the Lord. 
2ES.2.16	And I will raise those who are dead up again from their places, and bring them out from their tombs: for I
2ES.2.17	Don’t be afraid, you mother of the children: for I have chosen you, says the Lord. 
2ES.2.18	For your help I will send my servants Esaias and Jeremy, after whose counsel I have sanctified and prepared for you twelve trees laden with various fruits, 
2ES.2.19	and as many springs flowing with milk and honey, and seven mighty mountains, whereupon there grow roses and lilies, whereby I will fill your children with joy. 
2ES.2.20	Do right to the widow, judge the fatherless, give to the poor, defend the orphan, clothe the naked, 
2ES.2.21	heal the broken and the weak, laugh not a lame man to scorn, defend the maimed, and let the blind man come to the sight of my glory. 
2ES.2.22	Keep the old and young within your walls. 
2ES.2.23	Wherever you find the dead, set a sign upon them and commit them to the grave, and I will give you the first place in my resurrection. 
2ES.2.24	Stay still, O my people, and take your rest, for your quietness shall come. 
2ES.2.25	Nourish your children, O you good nurse, and establish their feet. 
2ES.2.26	As for the servants whom I have given you, there shall not one of them perish; for I will require them from amongst your number. 
2ES.2.27	Be not careful overmuch: for when the day of suffering and anguish comes, others shall weep and be sorrowful, but you shall be merry and have abundance. 
2ES.2.28	The nations shall envy you, but they shall be able to do nothing against you, says the Lord. 
2ES.2.29	My hands shall cover you, so that your children see not
2ES.2.30	Be joyful, O you mother, with your children; for I will deliver you, says the Lord. 
2ES.2.31	Remember your children that sleep, for I shall bring them out of the secret places of the earth, and show mercy to them: for I am merciful, says the Lord Almighty. 
2ES.2.32	Embrace your children until I come, and proclaim mercy to them: for my wells run over, and my grace shall not fail.
2ES.2.33	I Esdras received a charge from the Lord upon the mount Horeb, that I should go to Israel; but when I came to them, they would none of me, and rejected the commandment of the Lord. 
2ES.2.34	And therefore I say to you, O you° nations, that hear and understand, look for your shepherd, he shall give you everlasting rest; for he is near at hand, that shall come in the end of the world. 
2ES.2.35	Be ready to the rewards of the kingdom, for the everlasting light shall shine upon you for evermore. 
2ES.2.36	Flee the shadow of this world, receive the joyfulness of your glory: I call to witness my saviour openly. 
2ES.2.37	O receive that which is given you of the Lord, and be joyful, giving thanks to him that has called you to heavenly kingdoms. 
2ES.2.38	Arise up and stand, and behold the number of those that be sealed in the feast of the Lord; 
2ES.2.39	those who withdrew them from the shadow of the world have received glorious garments of the Lord. 
2ES.2.40	 Look upon your number, O Sion, and make up the reckoning of those of your that are clothed in white, which have fulfilled the law of the Lord. 
2ES.2.41	The number of your children, whom you long for, is fulfilled: beseech the power of the Lord, that your people, which have been called from the beginning, may be hallowed.
2ES.2.42	I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great multitude, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs. 
2ES.2.43	And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted. I marvelled greatly at this. 
2ES.2.44	So I asked the angel, and said, What are these, my Lord? 
2ES.2.45	He answered and said to me, These be those who have put off the mortal clothing, and put on the immortal, and have confessed the name of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms. 
2ES.2.46	Then said I to the angel, What young man is he that sets crowns upon them, and gives them palms in their hands? 
2ES.2.47	So he answered and said to me, It is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world. Then began I greatly to commend those who stood so stiffly for the name of the Lord. 
2ES.2.48	Then the angel said to me, Go your way, and tell my people what manner of things, and how great wonders of the Lord God you have seen.
2ES.3.1	In the thirties year after the ruin of the city, I Salathiel (also called Esdras) was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart: 
2ES.3.2	for I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of those who lived at Babylon. 
2ES.3.3	And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the Most High, and said, 
2ES.3.4	O Lord that bear rule, did you not not speak at the beginning, when you did fashion the earth, and that yourself alone, and command the
2ES.3.5	and it
2ES.3.6	And you led him into paradise, which your right hand did plant, before ever the earth came forward. 
2ES.3.7	And to him you gave your one commandment: which he transgressed, and immediately you appointed death for him and in his generations; and there were born of him nations and tribes, peoples and kindred, out of number. 
2ES.3.8	And every nation walked after their own will, and did ungodly things before you, and despised 
2ES.3.9	Nevertheless again in process of time you brought the flood upon those that lived in the world, and destroyed them. 
2ES.3.10	And it came to pass that the same hap befell them; like as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these. 
2ES.3.11	Nevertheless one of them you left, Noah with his household, 
2ES.3.12	And it came to pass, that when those who lived upon the earth began to multiply, they multiplied also children, and peoples, and many nations, and began again to be more ungodly than the first. 
2ES.3.13	And it came to pass, when they did wickedly before you, you did choose you one from amongst them, whose name was Abraham; 
2ES.3.14	and him you loved, and to him only you showed the end of the times secretly by night: 
2ES.3.15	and made an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that you would never forsake his seed. 
2ES.3.16	And to him you gave Isaac, and to Isaac you gave Jacob and Esau. And you did set apart Jacob for yourself, but did put by Esau: and Jacob became a great multitude. 
2ES.3.17	And it came to pass, that when you led his seed out of Egypt, you brought them up to the mount Sinai. 
2ES.3.18	You bowed the heavens also, and did
2ES.3.19	And your glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that you might give the law to the seed of Jacob, and the commandment to the generation of Israel. 
2ES.3.20	And yet took you not away from them 
2ES.3.21	For the first Adam bearing a
2ES.3.22	Thus disease was made permanent; and the law was in the heart of the people along with the
2ES.3.23	So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then did you raise you up a servant, called David, 
2ES.3.24	whom you commanded to build a city to your name, and to offer oblations to you therein of your own. 
2ES.3.25	When this was done many years, then those who inhabited the city did evil, 
2ES.3.26	in all things doing even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also bare a
2ES.3.27	and so you gave your city over into the hands of your enemies. 
2ES.3.28	And I said then in my heart, are their deeds any better that inhabit Babylon? and has she therefore dominion over Sion? 
2ES.3.29	For it came to pass when I came here, that I saw also impieties without number, and my soul saw many evil-doers in this thirties year, so that my heart failed me. 
2ES.3.30	For I have seen how you suffer them sinning, and have spared the ungodly doers, and have destroyed your people, and have preserved your enemies; and you have not signified 
2ES.3.31	to any
2ES.3.32	Or is there any other nation that knows you beside Israel? or what tribes have so believed your covenants as these 
2ES.3.33	And yet their reward appears not, and their labour has no fruit: for I have gone here and there through the nations, and I see that they abound 
2ES.3.34	Weigh you therefore our iniquities now in the balance, and theirs also that dwell in the world; and so shall it be found which way the scale inclines. 
2ES.3.35	Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in your sight? or what nation has so kept your commandments? 
2ES.3.36	You shall find that men 
2ES.4.1	And the angel that was sent to me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer, 
2ES.4.2	and said to me, your heart has utterly failed you in 
2ES.4.3	Then said I, Yes my Lord.
2ES.4.3	And he answered me, and said, I am sent to show you three ways, and to set forth three similitudes before you: 
2ES.4.4	whereof if you can declare me one, I also will show you the way that you desire to see, and I will teach you wherefore the heart is
2ES.4.5	And I said, say on, my Lord.
2ES.4.5	Then said he to me, Go to, weigh me a weight of fire, or measure me a
2ES.4.6	Then answered I and said, who of the sons 
2ES.4.7	And he said to me, If I had asked you, saying, How many dwellings are there in the heart of the sea? or how many springs are there at the fountain head of the deep? or how many
2ES.4.8	perhaps you would say to me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven. 
2ES.4.9	Nevertheless now have I asked you but only of the fire and wind, and of the day, things wherethrough you have passed, and
2ES.4.10	He said moreover to me, Your own things, that are grown up with you, can you not know; 
2ES.4.11	how then can your vessel comprehend the way of the Most High? and how can he that is already worn out with the corrupted world understand
2ES.4.13	He answered me, and said,
2ES.4.14	and said, Come! Let’s go and make war against the sea, that it may depart away before us, and that we may make us more woods. 
2ES.4.15	The waves of the sea also in like manner took counsel together, and said, Come! Let’s go up and subdue the wood of the plain, that there also we may make us another country. 
2ES.4.16	The counsel of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it: 
2ES.4.17	likewise also the counsel of the waves of the sea, for the sand stood up and stopped them. 
2ES.4.18	If you were judge now between these two, whom would you justify, or whom condemn?
2ES.4.19	I answered and said, it is a foolish counsel that they both have taken, for the ground is given to the wood, and the place of the sea 
2ES.4.20	Then answered he me, and said, You have given a right judgement, and why judge you not in your own case? 
2ES.4.21	For like as the ground is given to the wood, and the sea to his waves, even so those who dwell upon the earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he 
2ES.4.22	Then answered I and said, I beseech you, O Lord,
2ES.4.23	For it was not in my mind to be curious of the ways above, but of such things as pass by us daily; because Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen, 
2ES.4.24	and we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and our life is as a
2ES.4.25	What will he then do for his name whereby we are called? Of these things have I asked.
2ES.4.26	Then he answered me, and said, if you be 
2ES.4.27	For it is not able to bear the things that are promised to the righteous in the times 
2ES.4.28	For the evil
2ES.4.29	If therefore that which is sown be not reaped, and if the place where the evil is sown pass not away, there can’t come the field where the good is sown. 
2ES.4.30	For a grain of evil seed was sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much wickedness has it brought forth to this time! and how much shall it yet bring forth until the
2ES.4.31	Ponder now by yourself, how great fruit of wickedness a grain of evil seed has brought forth. 
2ES.4.32	When the ears which are without number shall be sown, how great a floor shall they fill!
2ES.4.33	Then I answered and said,
2ES.4.34	And he answered me, and said, You do not hasten more than the Most High: for your haste is
2ES.4.35	Did not the souls of the righteous ask question of these things in their chambers, saying, How long
2ES.4.36	And to them Jeremiel the archangel gave answer, and said, Even when the number is fulfilled of those who are like to you. For he has weighed the world in the balance; 
2ES.4.37	and by measure has he measured the times, and by number has he counted the seasons; and he shall not
2ES.4.38	Then answered I and said, O Lord that bear rule, yet even we all are full of impiety: 
2ES.4.39	and for our sakes perhaps it is that the
2ES.4.40	So he answered me, and said, Go your way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she has fulfilled her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her.
2ES.4.41	Then said I, no, Lord, that can it not.
2ES.4.41	And he said to me, in the grave the chambers of souls are like the womb: 
2ES.4.42	for like as a woman that travails makes haste to escape the anguish of the travail: even so do these places haste to deliver those things that are committed to them from the beginning. 
2ES.4.43	Then shall it be showed you concerning those things which you desire to see.
2ES.4.44	Then answered I and said, if I have found favour in your sight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet therefore, 
2ES.4.45	show me this also, whether there be more to come than is past, or whether the more part is gone over us. 
2ES.4.46	For what is gone I know, but what is for to come I know not.
2ES.4.47	And he said to me, Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude to you.
2ES.4.48	so I stood, and saw, and, behold, a hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened, that when the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still. 
2ES.4.49	After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past, the drops remained therein still.
2ES.4.50	Then said he to me, Consider with yourself; as the rain is more than the drops, and the fire is greater than the smoke, so the quantity which is past did more exceed; but the drops and the smoke remained still.
2ES.4.51	Then I prayed, and said, May I live, think you, until that time? or who shall be in those days?
2ES.4.52	He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof you asked me, I may tell you of them in part: but as touching your life, I am not sent to show you; for I do not know it.
2ES.5.1	Nevertheless as concerning the tokens, behold, the days shall come, that they which dwell upon earth shall be taken
2ES.5.2	But iniquity shall be increased above that which now you see, or that you have heard long ago. 
2ES.5.3	And the land, that you see now to have rule, shall be waste and
2ES.5.4	But if the Most High grant you to live, you shall see that which is after the third 
2ES.5.5	and blood shall drop out of wood, and the stone shall give his voice, and the peoples shall be troubled; and
2ES.5.6	and he shall rule, whom those who dwell upon the earth look not for, and the fowls shall take their flight away together: 
2ES.5.7	and the Sodomite sea shall cast out fish, and make a noise in the night, which many have not known: but all shall hear the voice thereof. 
2ES.5.8	There shall be chaos also in many places, and the fire shall be often sent out, and the wild beasts shall change their places, and women shall bring forth monsters: 
2ES.5.9	and salt waters shall be found in the sweet, and all friends shall destroy one another; then shall wit hide itself, and understanding withdraw itself into its chamber; 
2ES.5.10	and it shall be sought of many, and shall not be found: and unrighteousness and incontinency shall be multiplied upon earth. 
2ES.5.11	One land also shall ask another, and say, Is righteousness, is a man that does righteousness, gone through you? And it shall say, No. 
2ES.5.12	And it shall come to pass at that time that men shall hope, but shall not obtain: they shall labour, but their ways shall not prosper. 
2ES.5.13	To show you such tokens I have leave; and if you will pray again, and weep as now, and fast seven days, you shall hear yet greater things than these.
2ES.5.14	Then I awaked, and an extreme trembling went through my body, and my mind was troubled, so that it fainted. 
2ES.5.15	So the angel that was come to talk with me held me, comforted me, and set me up upon my feet. 
2ES.5.16	And in the second night it came to pass, that
2ES.5.17	or know you not that Israel is committed to you in the land of their captivity? 
2ES.5.18	Up then, and eat some bread, and forsake us not, as the shepherd 
2ES.5.19	Then said I to him, Go your ways from me, and come not near me for seven days, and then shall you come to me. And he heard what I said, and went from me.
2ES.5.20	And so I fasted seven days, mourning and weeping, like as Uriel the angel commanded me. 
2ES.5.21	And after seven days, so it was, that the thoughts of my heart were very grievous to me again, 
2ES.5.22	and my soul recovered the spirit of understanding, and I began to speak words before the Most High again, 
2ES.5.23	and said, O Lord that bear rule, of all the woods of the earth, and of all the trees thereof, you have chosen you one vine: 
2ES.5.24	and of all the lands of the world you have chosen you one
2ES.5.25	and of all the depths of the sea you have filled you one river: and of all built cities you have hallowed Sion to yourself: 
2ES.5.26	and of all the fowls that are created you have named you one dove: and of all the cattle that are made you have provided you one sheep: 
2ES.5.27	and amongst all the multitudes of peoples you have gotten you one people: and to this people, whom you loved, you gave a law that is approved of all. 
2ES.5.28	And now, O Lord, why have you given this one people over to many, and
2ES.5.29	And they which did gainsay your promises have trodden them down that believed your covenants. 
2ES.5.30	If you do so much hate your people, they should be punished with your own hands.
2ES.5.31	Now when I had spoken these words, the angel that came to me the night before was sent to me, 
2ES.5.32	and said to me, Hear me, and I will instruct you; listen to me, and I shall tell you more.
2ES.5.33	And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then said he to me, You are sore troubled in mind for Israel’s sake: love you that people better than he that made them?
2ES.5.34	And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for my reins torment me every hour, while I labour to comprehend the way of the Most High, and to seek out part of his judgement.
2ES.5.35	And he said to me, You can not. And I said, Wherefore, Lord, or whereunto was I born? or why was not my mother’s womb then my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil of the stock of Israel?
2ES.5.36	And he said to me, Number me those who are not yet come, gather me together the drops that are scattered abroad, make me the flowers green again that are withered, 
2ES.5.37	open me the chambers that are closed, and bring me forth the winds that in them are shut up, or show me the image of a voice: and then I will declare to you the travail that you asked to see.
2ES.5.38	And I said, O Lord that bear rule, who may know these things, but he that has not his dwelling with men? 
2ES.5.39	As for me, I am unwise: how may I then speak of these things whereof you asked me?
2ES.5.40	Then said he to me, Just as you can do none of these things that I have spoken of, even so can you not find out my judgement, or the end of the love that I have promised to my people.
2ES.5.41	And I said, But, behold, O Lord, you have made the promise to those who be in the end: and what shall they do that have been before us, or we 
2ES.5.42	And he said to me, I will liken my judgement to a ring: like as there is no slackness of those who are last, even so there is no swiftness of those who be first.
2ES.5.43	So I answered and said, Couldest you not make them 
2ES.5.44	Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not haste above the creator; neither may the world hold them at once that shall be created therein.
2ES.5.45	And I said, How have you said to your servant, that
2ES.5.46	And he said to me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say to her, If you bring forth ten children, why 
2ES.5.47	And I said, she can’t: but must do it by distance of time.
2ES.5.48	Then said he to me, Even so have I given the womb of the earth to those that be sown therein in their several times. 
2ES.5.49	For like as a young child may not bring forth, neither she that is grown old 
2ES.5.50	And I asked, and said, Seeing you have now showed me the way, I will speak before you: Is our mother, of whom you have told me, still young? or does she now draw near to age?
2ES.5.51	He answered me, and said, Ask a woman that bears children, and she shall tell you. 
2ES.5.52	Say to her, wherefore are not they whom you have now brought forth like those that were before, but less of stature? 
2ES.5.53	And she also shall answer you, They that be born in the strength of youth are of one fashion, and those who are born in the time of age, when the womb fails, are otherwise. 
2ES.5.54	Consider therefore you also, how that you° are less of stature than those that were before you. 
2ES.5.55	And so are those who come after you less than you°, as 
2ES.5.56	Then said I, Lord, I beseech you, if I have found favour in your sight, show your servant by whom you visit your creature.
2ES.6.1	And he said to me, In the beginning, when the earth was made, before the portals of the world were fixed, or ever the gatherings of the winds blew, 
2ES.6.2	before the voices of the thunder sounded and before the flashes of the lightning shone, or ever the foundations of paradise were laid, 
2ES.6.3	before the fair flowers were seen, or ever the powers of the earthquake were established, before the innumerable army of angels were gathered together, 
2ES.6.4	or ever the heights of the air were lifted up, before the measures of the firmament were named, or ever the footstool of Sion
2ES.6.5	and before the present years were sought out, and or ever the imaginations of those who now sin were estranged, before they were sealed that have gathered faith for a treasure: 
2ES.6.6	then did I consider these things, and they all were made through me alone, and through none other: as by me also they shall be ended, and by none other.
2ES.6.7	Then answered I and said, what shall be the parting asunder of the times? or when shall be the end of the first, and the beginning of it that follows?
2ES.6.8	And he said to me, From
2ES.6.9	For Esau is the end of this world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that follows. 
2ES.6.10	 The beginning of a man is his hand, and the end of a man is his heel; between the heel and the hand seek you nothing else, Esdras.
2ES.6.11	I answered then and said, O Lord that bear rule, If I have found favour in your sight, 
2ES.6.12	I beseech you, show your servant the end of your tokens, whereof you showed me part the last night.
2ES.6.13	So he answered and said to me, Stand up upon your feet, and you shall hear a mighty sounding voice; 
2ES.6.14	and if the place you stand on is greatly moved, 
2ES.6.15	when it speaks be you not afraid: for the word is of the end, and the foundations of the earth shall understand, 
2ES.6.16	that the speech is of them: they shall tremble and be moved: for they know that their end must be changed.
2ES.6.17	And it happened, that when I had heard it I stood up upon my feet, and listened, and, behold, there was a voice that spoke, and the sound of it was like the sound of many waters. 
2ES.6.18	And it said, Behold, the days come, and it shall be that when I draw near to visit those who dwell upon the earth, 
2ES.6.19	and when I shall make inquisition of those who have done hurt unjustly with their unrighteousness, and when the affliction of Sion shall be fulfilled, 
2ES.6.20	and when the seal shall be set upon the world that is to pass away, then I will show these tokens: the books shall be opened before the firmament, and all shall see together: 
2ES.6.21	and the children of a year old shall speak with their voices, the women with child shall bring forth untimely children at three or four months, and they shall live, and dance. 
2ES.6.22	And suddenly shall the sown places appear unsown, the full storehouses shall suddenly be found empty: 
2ES.6.23	and the trumpet shall give a sound, which when every man hears, they shall be suddenly afraid. 
2ES.6.24	At that time shall friends make war one against another like enemies, and the earth shall stand in fear with those that dwell therein, the springs of the springs shall stand still, so that for three hours they shall not run. 
2ES.6.25	And it shall be that whoever remains after all these things that I have told you of, he shall be saved, and shall see my salvation, and the end of my world. 
2ES.6.26	And they shall see the men that have been taken up, who have not tasted death from their birth: and the heart of the inhabitants shall be changed, and turned into another meaning. 
2ES.6.27	For evil shall be blotted out, and deceit shall be quenched; 
2ES.6.28	and faith shall flourish, and corruption shall be overcome, and the truth, which has been so long without fruit, shall be declared.
2ES.6.29	And when he talked with me, behold, by little and little the place I stood on
2ES.6.30	And he said to me, These things came I to show you
2ES.6.31	If therefore you will pray yet again, and fast seven days more, I shall yet
2ES.6.32	For your voice has surely been heard before the Most High: for the Mighty has seen your righteous dealing, he has seen aforetime also your chastity, which you have had ever since your youth. 
2ES.6.33	And therefore has he sent me to show you all these things, and to say to you, Be of good comfort, and fear not. 
2ES.6.34	And be not hasty in 
2ES.6.35	And it came to pass after this, that I wept again, and fasted seven days in like manner, that I might fulfil the three weeks which he told me. 
2ES.6.36	And in the eighth night was my heart vexed within me again, and I began to speak before the Most High. 
2ES.6.37	For my spirit was greatly set on fire, and my soul was in distress. 
2ES.6.38	And I said, O Lord, of a truth you spoke at the beginning of the creation, upon the first day, and said thus; Let heaven and earth be made; and your word perfected the work. 
2ES.6.39	And then was the spirit hovering, and darkness and silence were on every side; the sound of man’s voice was not yet.
2ES.6.40	Then command you a ray of light to be brought forth of your treasures, that then your works might appear. 
2ES.6.41	Upon the second day again you made the spirit of the firmament and commanded it to part asunder, and to make a division between the waters, that the one part might go up, and the other remain beneath. 
2ES.6.42	Upon the third day you did command that the waters should be gathered together in the seventh part of the earth: six parts did you dry up, and keep them, to the intent that of these some being both planted and tilled might serve before you. 
2ES.6.43	For as soom as your word went forth the work was done. 
2ES.6.44	For immediately there came forth great and innumerable fruit, and manifold pleasures for the taste, and flowers of inimitable colour, and odours of most exquisite smell: and this was done the third day. 
2ES.6.45	Upon the fourth day you commanded that the sun should shine, and the moon give her light, and the stars should be in their order: 
2ES.6.46	and gave them a charge to do service to man, that was to be made. 
2ES.6.47	Upon the fifth day you said to the seventh part, where the water was gathered together, that it should bring forth living creatures, fowls and fishes: and so it came to pass, 
2ES.6.48	that the mute water and without life brought forth living things as it was told, that the peoples might therefore praise your wondrous works. 
2ES.6.49	Then did you preserve two living creatures, the one you calledst Behemoth, and the other you calledst Leviathan: 
2ES.6.50	and you did separate the one from the other: for the seventh part, namely, where the water was gathered together, might not hold them both. 
2ES.6.51	To Behemoth you gave one part, which was dried up on the third day, that he should dwell in it, wherein are a thousand hills: 
2ES.6.52	but to Leviathan you gave the seventh part, namely, the moist; and you have kept them to be devoured of whom you will, and when. 
2ES.6.53	But upon the sixth day you gave commandment to the earth, that it should bring forth before you cattle, beasts, and creeping things: 
2ES.6.54	and over these Adam, whom you ordain lord over all the works that you have made: of him come we all, the people whom you have chosen. 
2ES.6.55	All this have I spoken before you, O Lord, because you have said that for our sakes you made
2ES.6.56	As for the other nations, which also come of Adam, you have said that they are nothing, and are like to spittle: and you have likened the abundance of them to a drop that falls from a vessel. 
2ES.6.57	And now, O Lord, behold these nations, which are reputed as nothing, be lords over us, and devour us. 
2ES.6.58	But we your people, whom you have called your firstborn, your only begotten, and your fervent lover, are given into their hands. 
2ES.6.59	If the world now be made for our sakes, why do we not possess for an inheritance our world? How long shall this endure?
2ES.7.1	And when I had made an end of speaking these words, there was sent to me the angel which had been sent to me the nights before: 
2ES.7.2	and he said to me, Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I am come to tell you. 
2ES.7.3	And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then he said to me, There is a sea set in a wide place, that it might be
2ES.7.4	But the entrance thereof shall be set in a narrow place so as to be like a river; 
2ES.7.5	whoso then should desire to go into the sea to look upon it, or to rule it, if he went not through the narrow, how could he come into the broad? 
2ES.7.6	Another thing also: There is a city built and set in a plain country, and full of all good things; 
2ES.7.7	but the entrance thereof is narrow, and is set in a dangerous place to fall, having a fire on the right hand, and on the left a deep water: 
2ES.7.8	and there is one only path between them both, even between the fire and the water, 
2ES.7.9	If this city now be given to a man for an inheritance, if the heir pass not the danger before him, how shall he receive his inheritance? 
2ES.7.10	And I said, It is so, Lord. Then said he to me, Even so also is Israel’s portion. 
2ES.7.11	Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was decreed that now is done. 
2ES.7.12	Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, and sorrowful and toilsome: they are but few and evil, full of perils, and charged with great toils. 
2ES.7.13	For the entrances of the greater world are wide and sure, and bring forth fruit of immortality. 
2ES.7.14	If then those who live enter not these strait and vain things, they can never receive those that are laid up for them. 
2ES.7.15	Now therefore why you disquiet yourself, seeing you are but a corruptible man? and why are you moved, whereas you are but mortal? 
2ES.7.16	and why have you not considered in your mind that which is to come, rather than that which is present? 
2ES.7.17	Then answered I and said, O Lord that bear rule, behold, you have ordained in your law, that the righteous should inherit these things, but that the ungodly should perish. 
2ES.7.18	The righteous therefore shall suffer strait things, and hope for wide: but those who have done wickedly
2ES.7.19	And he said to me,
2ES.7.20	Yes, rather let many that now be perish, than that the law of God which is set before them be despised. 
2ES.7.21	For God straitly commanded such as came, even as they came, what they should do to live, and what they should observe to avoid punishment. 
2ES.7.22	Nevertheless they were not obedient to him; but spoke against him, and imagined for themselves vain things; 
2ES.7.23	and framed cunning plans of wickedness; and said moreover of the Most High, that he is not; and knew not his ways: 
2ES.7.24	but they despised his law, and denied his covenants; they have not been faithful to his statutes, and have not performed his works. 
2ES.7.25	Therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, and for the full are the full things. 
2ES.7.26	For behold, the time shall come, and it shall be, when these tokens, of which I told you before, shall come to pass, that the bride shall appear, even the city coming forth, and she shall be seen, that now is withdrawn from the earth. 
2ES.7.27	And whoever is delivered from the aforesaid evils shall see my wonders. 
2ES.7.28	For my son Jesus shall be revealed with those that be with him, and shall rejoice those who remain four hundred years. 
2ES.7.29	After these years shall my son Christ die of those who, and all that have the breath of
2ES.7.30	And the world shall be turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the first beginning: so that no man shall remain. 
2ES.7.31	And after seven days the world, that yet awakens not, shall be raised up, and that shall die that is corruptible. 
2ES.7.32	And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her, and so shall the dust those that dwell therein in silence, and the
2ES.7.33	And the Most High shall be revealed upon the seat of judgement,
2ES.7.34	but judgement only shall remain, truth shall stand, and faith shall wax strong: 
2ES.7.35	and the work shall follow, and the reward shall be showed, and good deeds shall awake, and wicked deeds shall not sleep.
2ES.7.36	And the
2ES.7.37	And then shall the Most High say to the nations that are raised from the dead, See you° and understand whom you° have denied, or whom you° have not served, or whose commandments you° have despised. 
2ES.7.38	Look on this side and on that: here is delight and rest, and there fire and torments. Thus
2ES.7.39	This is a day that has neither sun, nor moon, nor stars, 
2ES.7.40	neither cloud, nor thunder, nor lightning, neither wind, nor water, nor air, neither darkness, nor evening, nor morning, 
2ES.7.41	neither summer, nor spring, nor heat, nor
2ES.7.42	neither noon, nor night, nor dawn, neither shining, nor brightness, nor light, save only the splendour of the glory of the Most High, whereby all shall see the things that are set before them: 
2ES.7.43	for it shall endure as it were a week of years. 
2ES.7.44	This is my judgement and the ordinance thereof; but to you only have I showed these things.
2ES.7.45	And I answered, I said even then, O Lord, and I say now: blessed are those who are now alive and keep the 
2ES.7.46	But as touching them for whom my prayer was made, 
2ES.7.47	And now I see, that the world to come shall bring delight to few, but torments to many. 
2ES.7.48	For an evil heart has grown up in us, which has led us astray from these 
2ES.7.49	And he answered me, and said, Listen to me, and I will instruct you; and I will admonish you yet again: 
2ES.7.50	for this cause the Most High has not made one world, but two. 
2ES.7.51	For whereas you have said that the just are not many, but few, and the ungodly abound, hear 
2ES.7.52	If you have exceedingly few choice stones,
2ES.7.53	And I said, Lord, how shall this be?
2ES.7.54	And he said to me, Not only this, but ask the earth, and she shall tell you; entreat her, and she shall declare to you. 
2ES.7.55	For you shall say to her, You bring forth gold and silver and brass, and iron also and lead and clay: 
2ES.7.56	but silver is more abundant than gold, and brass than silver, and iron than brass, lead than iron, and clay than lead. 
2ES.7.57	Judge you therefore which things are precious and to be desired, what is abundant or what is rare.
2ES.7.58	And I said, O Lord that bear rule, that which is plentiful is of less worth, for that which is more rare is more precious.
2ES.7.59	And he answered me, and said,
2ES.7.60	So also is the
2ES.7.61	And I will not grieve over the multitude of those who perish; for these are those who are now like to vapour, and are become as flame and smoke; they are set on fire and burn hotly, and are quenched.
2ES.7.62	And I answered and said, O you earth, wherefore have you brought forth, if the mind is made out of dust, like as all other created things? 
2ES.7.63	For it were better that the dust itself had been unborn, so that the mind might not have been made therefrom. 
2ES.7.64	But now the mind grows with us, and by reason of this we are tormented, because we perish and know it. 
2ES.7.65	Let the race of men lament and the beasts of the field be glad; let all that are born lament, but let the four-footed beasts and the cattle rejoice. 
2ES.7.66	For it is far better with them than with us; for they look not for judgement, neither do they know of torments or of salvation promised to them after death. 
2ES.7.67	For what does it profit us, that we shall be preserved alive, but yet be afflicted with torment? 
2ES.7.68	For all that are born are
2ES.7.69	and if after death we were not to come into judgement, perhaps it had been better for us.
2ES.7.70	And he answered me, and said, When the Most High made the world, and Adam and all those who came of him, he first prepared the Judgement and the things that pertain to the judgement. 
2ES.7.71	And now understand from your own words, for you have said that the mind grows with us. 
2ES.7.72	They therefore that dwell upon the earth shall be tormented for this reason, that having understanding they have done iniquity, and receiving commandments have not kept them, and having obtained a law they dealt unfaithfully with that which they received. 
2ES.7.73	What then will they have to say in the judgement, or how will they answer in the last times? 
2ES.7.74	For how great a time has the Most High been patient with those who inhabit the world, and not for their sakes, but because of the times which he has foreordained!
2ES.7.75	And I answered and said, if I have found grace in your sight, O Lord, show this also to your servant, whether after death, even now when every one of us gives up his soul, we shall be kept in rest until those times come, in which you shall renew the creation, or whether we shall be tormented forthwith.
2ES.7.76	And he answered me, and said, I will show you this also; but join not yourself with those who are scorners, nor count yourself with those who are tormented. 
2ES.7.77	For you have a treasure of 
2ES.7.78	For concerning death the teaching is: When the determinate sentence has gone forth from the Most High that a man should die, as the spirit leaves the body to return again to him who gave it, it adores the glory of the Most High first of all. 
2ES.7.79	And if it be one of those that have been scorners and have not kept the way of the Most High, and that have despised his law, and that hate those who fear
2ES.7.80	these spirits shall not enter into habitations, but shall wander and be in torments forthwith, ever grieving and sad, in seven ways. 
2ES.7.81	The first way, because they have despised the law of the Most High. 
2ES.7.82	The second way, because they can’t now make a good returning that they may live. 
2ES.7.83	The third way, they shall see the reward laid up for those who have believed the covenants of the Most High. 
2ES.7.84	The fourth way, they shall consider the torment laid up for themselves in the last days. 
2ES.7.85	The fifth way, they shall see the dwelling places of the others guarded by angels, with great quietness. 
2ES.7.86	The sixth way, they shall see
2ES.7.87	The seventh way, which is
2ES.7.88	Now this is the order of those who have kept the ways of the Most High, when they shall be separated from the corruptible vessel. 
2ES.7.89	In the time
2ES.7.90	Wherefore this is the teaching concerning them: 
2ES.7.91	First of all they shall see with great joy the glory of him who takes them up, for they shall have rest in seven orders. 
2ES.7.92	The first order, because they have laboured with great effort to overcome the evil thought which was fashioned together with them, that it might not lead them astray from life into death. 
2ES.7.93	The second order, because they see the perplexity in which the souls of the ungodly wander, and the punishment that awaits them. 
2ES.7.94	The third order, they see the witness which he that fashioned them bears concerning them, that while they lived they kept the law which was given them in trust. 
2ES.7.95	The fourth order, they understand the rest which, being gathered in their chambers, they now enjoy with great quietness, guarded by angels, and the glory that awaits them in the last days. 
2ES.7.96	The fifth order, they rejoice, 
2ES.7.97	The sixth order, when it is showed to them how their face shall shine as the sun, and how they shall be made like to the light of the stars, being henceforth incorruptible. 
2ES.7.98	The seventh order, which is greater than all the aforesaid orders, because they shall rejoice with confidence, and because they shall be bold without confusion, and shall be glad without fear, for they hasten to behold the face of him whom in their lifetime they served, and from whom they shall receive 
2ES.7.99	This is the order of the souls of the just, as from henceforth
2ES.7.100	And I answered and said, shall time therefore be given to the souls after they are separated from the bodies, that they may see that whereof you have spoken to me? 
2ES.7.101	And he said, Their freedom shall be for seven days, that for seven days they may see the things whereof you have been told, and afterwards they shall be gathered together in their habitations. 
2ES.7.102	And I answered and said, if I have found favour in your sight, show further to me your servant whether in the day of judgement the just will be able to intercede for the ungodly or to entreat the Most High for them, 
2ES.7.103	whether fathers for children, or children for parents, or kindred for kindred, or kinsfolk for their next of kin, or
2ES.7.104	And he answered me, and said, Since you have found favour in my sight, I will show you this also: The day of judgement is
2ES.7.105	so never shall anyone pray for another
2ES.7.106	And I answered and said, How do we now find that first Abraham prayed for the people of Sodom, and Moses for the fathers that sinned in the wilderness: 
2ES.7.107	and Joshua after him for Israel in the days of
2ES.7.108	and Samuel
2ES.7.109	and Elijah for those that received rain; and for the dead, that he might live: 
2ES.7.110	and Hezekiah for the people in the days of Sennacherib: and many for many? 
2ES.7.111	If therefore now, when corruption is grown up, and unrighteousness increased, the righteous have prayed for the ungodly, wherefore shall it not be so then also?
2ES.7.112	He answered me, and said, This present world is not the end; the full glory remains
2ES.7.113	But the day of judgement shall be the end of this time,
2ES.7.114	intemperance is at an end, infidelity is cut off, but righteousness is grown, and truth is sprung up. 
2ES.7.115	Then shall no man be able to have mercy on him that is cast in judgement, nor to thrust down him that has gotten the victory.
2ES.7.116	I answered then and said, this is my first and last saying, that it had been better that the earth had not given 
2ES.7.117	For what profit is it for all that are in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for punishment? 
2ES.7.118	O you Adam, what have you done? For though it was you that sinned, the evil is not fallen on you alone, but upon all of us that come of you. 
2ES.7.119	For what profit is it to us, if there be promised us an immortal time, whereas we have done the works that bring death? 
2ES.7.120	And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, whereas ourselves most miserably are become vain? 
2ES.7.121	And that there are reserved habitations of health and safety, whereas we have lived wickedly? 
2ES.7.122	And that the glory of the Most High shall defend them which have led a pure life, whereas we have walked in the most wicked ways of all? 
2ES.7.123	And that there shall be showed a paradise, whose fruit endures without decay, wherein is abundance and healing, but we shall not enter into it, 
2ES.7.124	for we have walked in unpleasant places? 
2ES.7.125	And that the faces of them which have used abstinence shall shine above the stars, whereas our faces shall be blacker than darkness? 
2ES.7.126	For while we lived and committed iniquity, we considered not what we should have to suffer after death.
2ES.7.127	Then he answered and said, This is the
2ES.7.128	that, if he be overcome, he shall suffer as you have said: but if he get the victory, he shall receive the thing that I say. 
2ES.7.129	For this is the way whereof Moses spoke to the people while he lived, saying, Choose you life, that you may live. 
2ES.7.130	Nevertheless they believed not him, nor yet the prophets after him, no, nor me which have spoken to them; 
2ES.7.131	so that there shall not be such heaviness in their destruction, as there shall be joy over those who are persuaded to salvation.
2ES.7.132	I answered then and said, I know, Lord, that the Most High is now called merciful, in that he has mercy upon them which are not yet come into the world; 
2ES.7.133	and compassionate, in that he has compassion upon those that turn to his law; 
2ES.7.134	and patient, for that he long suffers those that have sinned, as his creatures; 
2ES.7.135	and bountiful, for that he is ready to give rather than to exact; 
2ES.7.136	and of great mercy, for that he multiplies more and more mercies to those who are present, and that are past, and also to them which are to come; 
2ES.7.137	(for if he multiplied not 
2ES.7.138	and one that forgives, for if he didn’t forgive of his goodness, that they which have committed iniquities might be eased of them, the ten thousandth part of men would not remain living; 
2ES.7.139	and a judge, 
2ES.7.140	there would perhaps be very few left in an innumerable multitude.
2ES.8.1	And he answered me, and said, The Most High has made this world for many, but the world to come for few. 
2ES.8.2	I will tell you now a similitude, Esdras; As when you asks the earth, it shall say to you, that it gives very much mould whereof earthen vessels are made, and little dust that gold comes of: even so is the course of the present world. 
2ES.8.3	There be many created, but few shall be saved.
2ES.8.4	And I answered and said, Swallow down understanding then, O my soul, and let 
2ES.8.5	For you
2ES.8.6	O Lord, that are over us, suffer your servant, that we may pray before you, and give us seed to our heart, and culture to our understanding, that there may come fruit of it, whereby every one shall live that is corrupt, who bears the
2ES.8.7	For you are alone, and we all one workmanship of your hands, like as you have said. 
2ES.8.8	Forasmuch as you quicken the body that is fashioned now in the womb, and give it members, your creature is preserved in fire and water, and nine months does your workmanship endure your creature which is created in her. 
2ES.8.9	But that which keeps and that which is kept shall both be kept
2ES.8.10	you have commanded that out of the parts of the body, that is to say, out of the breasts, be given milk, which is the fruit of the breasts, 
2ES.8.11	that the thing which is fashioned may be nourished for a time, and afterwards you shall order it in your mercy. 
2ES.8.12	Yes, you have brought it up in your righteousness, and nurtured it in your law, and corrected it with your judgement. 
2ES.8.13	And you shall mortify it as your creature, and quicken it as your work. 
2ES.8.14	If therefore you shall
2ES.8.15	Now therefore I will speak; touching man in general, you know best; but touching your people 
2ES.8.16	and for your inheritance, for whose cause I mourn; and for Israel, for whom I am heavy; and for the seed of Jacob, for whose sake I am troubled; 
2ES.8.17	therefore I will begin to pray before you for myself and for them: for I see the falls of us that dwell in the land; 
2ES.8.18	but I have heard the swiftness of the judgement which is to come. 
2ES.8.19	Therefore hear my voice, and understand my saying, and I will speak before you.
2ES.8.19	The beginning of the words of Esdras, before he was taken up. And he said,
2ES.8.20	O Lord, you who
2ES.8.21	whose throne is inestimable; whose glory may not be comprehended; before whom the army of angels stand with trembling, 
2ES.8.22	 at whose bidding they are changed to wind and fire; whose word is sure, and sayings constant; whose ordinance is strong, and commandment fearful; 
2ES.8.23	whose look dries up the depths, and whose indignation makes the mountains to melt away, and whose truth bears witness: 
2ES.8.24	hear, O Lord, the prayer of your servant, and give ear to the petition of your handiwork; 
2ES.8.25	attend to my words, for so long as I live I will speak, and so long as I have understanding I will answer. 
2ES.8.26	O look not upon the sins of your people; but on those who have served you in truth, 
2ES.8.27	Regard not the doings of those who deal wickedly, but of those who have kept your covenants in affliction. 
2ES.8.28	Think not upon those that have walked feignedly before you; but remember them which have willingly known your fear. 
2ES.8.29	Let it not be your will to destroy them which have lived like cattle; but look upon those who have
2ES.8.30	Take you no indignation at them which are deemed worse than beasts; but love those who have always put their trust in your glory. 
2ES.8.31	For we and our fathers have
2ES.8.32	For if you have a desire to have mercy upon us, then shall you be called merciful, to us, namely, that have no works of righteousness. 
2ES.8.33	For the just, which have many 
2ES.8.34	For what is man, that you should take displeasure at him? or what is a corruptible race, that you should be so bitter towards it? 
2ES.8.35	For in truth there is no man amongst those who are born, but he has dealt wickedly; and amongst them
2ES.8.36	For in this, O Lord, your righteousness and your goodness shall be declared, if you be merciful to them which have no store of good works.
2ES.8.37	Then answered he me, and said, Some things have you spoken aright, and according to your words so shall it come to pass. 
2ES.8.38	For indeed I will not think on the fashioning of them which have sinned, or their death, their judgement, or their destruction; 
2ES.8.39	but I will rejoice over the framing of the righteous, their pilgrimage also, and the salvation, and the reward, that they shall have. 
2ES.8.40	Like therefore as I have spoken, so shall it be. 
2ES.8.41	For as the husbandman sows much seed upon the ground, and plants many trees, and yet not all that is sown shall
2ES.8.42	I answered then and said, if I have found favour, let me speak before you. 
2ES.8.43	Forasmuch as the husbandman’s seed, if it come not up, seeing that it has not received your rain in due season, or if it be corrupted through too much rain,
2ES.8.44	likewise man, which is formed with your hands, and is called your own image, because he is made like 
2ES.8.45	Be not angry with us, but spare your people, and have mercy upon your inheritance; for you have mercy upon your own creation.
2ES.8.46	Then answered he me, and said, Things present are for those who now be, and things to come for such as shall be hereafter. 
2ES.8.47	For you come far short that you should be able to love my creature more than I. But you have brought yourself full near to the unrighteous. 
2ES.8.48	Yet in this shall you be admirable to the Most High; 
2ES.8.49	in that you have humbled yourself, as it becomes you, and have not judged yourself 
2ES.8.50	For many grievous miseries shall fall on those who in the last times dwell in the world, because they have walked in great pride. 
2ES.8.51	But understand you for yourself, and of such as be like you seek out the glory. 
2ES.8.52	For to you is paradise opened, the tree of life planted, the time to come is prepared, plenteousness is made ready, a city is built, and rest is
2ES.8.53	The root 
2ES.8.54	sorrows are passed away, and in the end is showed the treasure of immortality. 
2ES.8.55	Therefore ask you no more questions concerning the multitude of them that perish. 
2ES.8.56	For when they had received liberty, they despised the Most High, thought scorn of his law, and forsook his ways. 
2ES.8.57	Moreover they have trodden down his righteous, 
2ES.8.58	and said in their heart, that there is no God; yes, and that knowing they must die. 
2ES.8.59	For as the things aforesaid shall receive you, so thirst and pain which are prepared 
2ES.8.60	but they which be created have themselves defiled the name of him that made them, and were unthankful to him which prepared life for them. 
2ES.8.61	And therefore is my judgement now at hand, 
2ES.8.62	which I have not showed to all men, but to you, and a few like you.
2ES.8.62	Then answered I and said, 
2ES.8.63	Behold, O Lord, now have you showed me the multitude of the wonders, which you will do in the last times: but at what time, you have not showed me.
2ES.9.1	And he answered me, and said, Measure you diligently within yourself: and when you see that a certain part of the signs are past, which have been told you beforehand, 
2ES.9.2	then shall you understand, that it is the very time, wherein the Most High will visit the world which was made by him. 
2ES.9.3	And when there shall be seen in the world earthquakes, disquietude of peoples, plans of nations, wavering of leaders, disquietude of princes, 
2ES.9.4	then shall you understand, that the Most High spoke of these things from the days that were aforetime from the beginning. 
2ES.9.5	For like as of all that is made in the world, the beginning
2ES.9.6	so also are the times of the Most High: the beginnings are manifest in wonders and mighty works, and the end in effects and signs. 
2ES.9.7	And everyone that shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his works, or by faith, whereby he has believed, 
2ES.9.8	shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my borders, which I have sanctified for me from the beginning. 
2ES.9.9	Then shall they be amazed, which now have abused my ways: and those who have cast them away despitefully shall dwell in torments. 
2ES.9.10	For as many as in their life have received benefits, and yet have not known me; 
2ES.9.11	and as many as have scorned my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of repentance was open to them, understood not, but despised
2ES.9.12	must know
2ES.9.13	And therefore be you no longer curious how the ungodly shall be punished; but enquire how the righteous shall be saved,
2ES.9.14	And I answered and said, 
2ES.9.15	I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be more of them which perish, than of the which will be saved: 
2ES.9.16	like as a wave is greater than a drop.
2ES.9.17	And he answered me, saying, Just as the field is, so also the seed; and as the flowers be, such are the colours also; and such as the work is, such also is the
2ES.9.18	even then when I was preparing for those who now live, before the world was made for them to dwell in; and then no man spoke against me, 
2ES.9.19	for
2ES.9.20	So I considered my world, and, behold, it was destroyed, and my earth, and, behold, it was in peril, because of the plans that had come into it. 
2ES.9.21	And I saw, and spared them, but not greatly, and saved me a grape out of a cluster, and a plant out of
2ES.9.22	Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be saved, and my plant; for with great labour have I made them perfect. 
2ES.9.23	Nevertheless if you will cease yet seven days more, (however you shall not fast in them, 
2ES.9.24	but shall go into a field of flowers, where no house is built, and eat only of the flowers of the field; and you shall taste no flesh, and shall drink no wine, but 
2ES.9.25	and pray to the Most High continually, then I will come and talk with you.
2ES.9.26	So I went my way, like as he commanded me, into the field which is called
2ES.9.27	And it came to pass after seven days that I lay upon the grass, and my heart was vexed again, like as before: 
2ES.9.28	and my mouth was opened, and I began to speak before the Lord Most High, and said, 
2ES.9.29	O Lord, you did show yourself amongst us, to our fathers in the wilderness, when they went forth out of Egypt, and when they came into the wilderness, where no man treads and that bears no fruit; 
2ES.9.30	and you did say, Hear me, you Israel; and mark my words, O seed of Jacob. 
2ES.9.31	For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring forth fruit in you, and you° shall be glorified in it forever. 
2ES.9.32	But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, and observed not the statutes: and the fruit of the law didn’t perish, neither could it, for it was your; 
2ES.9.33	yet those who received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them. 
2ES.9.34	And, behold, it is a custom, that when the ground has received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or drink, and when it comes to pass that that which is sown, or that which is launched, 
2ES.9.35	or the things which have been received, should come to an end, these come to an end, but the receptacles remain: yet with us it has not happened so. 
2ES.9.36	For we that have received the law shall perish by sin, and our heart also which received it. 
2ES.9.37	Notwithstanding the law perishes not, but remains in its honour.
2ES.9.38	And when I spoke these things in my heart, I looked about me with my eyes, and upon the right side I saw a woman, and, behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in mind, and her clothes were tore, and she had ashes upon her head. 
2ES.9.39	Then let I my thoughts go wherein I was occupied, and turned me to her, 
2ES.9.40	and said to her, Why do you weep? and why are you grieved in your mind?
2ES.9.41	And she said to me, Let me alone, my Lord, that I may bewail myself, and add to my sorrow, for I am sore vexed in my mind, and brought very low.
2ES.9.42	And I said to her, What ails you? Tell me. 
2ES.9.43	She said to me, I your servant was barren, and had no child, though I had a husband thirty years. 
2ES.9.44	And every hour and every day these thirty years did I make my prayer to the Most High day and night. 
2ES.9.45	And it came to pass after thirty years that God heard me your handmaid, and looked upon my low estate, and considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I rejoiced in him greatly, I and my husband, and all my
2ES.9.46	And I nourished him with great travail. 
2ES.9.47	So when he grew up, and I came to take him a wife, I made him a feast day.
2ES.10.1	And it so came to pass, that when my son was entered into his wedding chamber, he fell down, and died. 
2ES.10.2	Then we all overthrew the lights, and all my
2ES.10.3	And it came to pass, when they had all left off to comfort me, to the end I might be quiet, then rose I up by night, and fled, and came here into this field, as you see. 
2ES.10.4	And I do now purpose not to return into the city, but here to stay, and neither to eat nor drink, but continually to mourn and to fast until I die.
2ES.10.5	Then left I the meditations wherein I was, and answered her in anger, and said, 
2ES.10.6	You foolish woman above all other, see you not our mourning, and what has happened to us? 
2ES.10.7	how that Sion the mother of us all is full of sorrow, and much humbled. 
2ES.10.8	 It is right now to mourn very sore, seeing we all mourn, and to be sorrowful, seeing we are all in sorrow, but you sorrowest for one son. 
2ES.10.9	For ask the earth, and she shall tell you, that it is she which ought to mourn for so many that grow upon her. 
2ES.10.10	For out of her all had their beginnings, and others shall come; and, behold, they walk almost all into destruction, and the multitude of them is utterly rooted out. 
2ES.10.11	Who then should make more mourning,
2ES.10.12	but if you say to me, My lamentation is not like the earth’s, for I have lost the fruit of my womb, which I brought forth with pains, and bare with sorrows: 
2ES.10.13	but 
2ES.10.14	then say I to you, Just as you have brought forth with sorrow; even so the earth also has given her fruit, namely, man, ever since the beginning to him that made her. 
2ES.10.15	Now therefore keep your sorrow to yourself, and bear with a good courage the adversities which have befallen you. 
2ES.10.16	For if you shall acknowledge the decree of God to be just, you shall both receive your son in time, and shall be praised amongst women. 
2ES.10.17	Go your way then into the city to your husband.
2ES.10.18	And she said to me, “I won’t do that. I will not go into the city, but I will die here.”
2ES.10.19	So I proceeded to speak further to her, and said, 
2ES.10.20	Do not so, but suffer yourself to be prevailed on by reason of the adversities of Sion; and be comforted by reason of the sorrow of Jerusalem. 
2ES.10.21	For you see that our sanctuary is laid waste, our altar broken down, our temple destroyed; 
2ES.10.22	our lute is brought low, our song is put to silence, our rejoicing is at an end; the light of our candlestick is put out, the ark of our covenant is plundered, our holy things are defiled, and the name that is called upon us is profaned; our freemen are despitefully treated, our priests are burnt, our Levites are gone into captivity, our virgins are defiled, and our wives ravished; our righteous men carried away, our little ones betrayed, our young men are brought into bondage, and our strong men are become weak; 
2ES.10.23	and, what is more than all, the seal of Sion—for she has now lost the seal of her honour, and is delivered into the hands of those who hate us. 
2ES.10.24	You therefore shake off your great heaviness, and put away from you the multitude of sorrows, that the Mighty may be merciful to you again, and the Most High may give you rest, even ease from your travails.
2ES.10.25	And it came to pass, while I was talking with her, behold, her face upon a sudden shined exceedingly, and her countenance glistered like lightning, so that I was sore afraid
2ES.10.26	and, behold, suddenly she made a great cry very fearful; so that the earth shook at the noise. 
2ES.10.27	And I looked, and, behold, the woman appeared to me no more, but there was a city built, and a place showed itself from large foundations: then was I afraid, and cried with a loud voice, and said, 
2ES.10.28	Where is Uriel the angel, who came to me at the first? for he has caused me to fall into this great trance, and my end is turned into corruption, and my prayer to rebuke. 
2ES.10.29	And as I was speaking these words, behold, the angel who had come to me at the first came to me, and he looked upon me: 
2ES.10.30	and, behold, I lay as one that had been dead, and my understanding was taken from me; and he took me by the right hand, and comforted me, and set me upon my feet, and said to me, 
2ES.10.31	What ails you? and why are you so disquieted? and why is your understanding troubled, and the thoughts of your heart? 
2ES.10.32	And I said, Because you have forsaken me: yet I did according to your words, and went into the field, and, behold, I have seen, and yet see, that which I am not able to express. 
2ES.10.33	And he said to me, Stand up like a man, and I will advise you. 
2ES.10.34	Then said I, Speak on, my Lord; only forsake me not, lest I die frustrate of my hope. 
2ES.10.35	For I have seen that I knew not, and hear that I do not know. 
2ES.10.36	Or is my sense deceived, or my soul in a dream? 
2ES.10.37	Now therefore I beseech you to show your servant concerning this trance.
2ES.10.38	And he answered me, and said, Hear me, and I shall inform you, and tell you concerning the things whereof you are afraid: For the Most High has revealed many secret things to you. 
2ES.10.39	He has seen that your way is right: for that you sorrowest continually for your people, and make great lamentation for Sion. 
2ES.10.40	This therefore is the meaning of the vision. 
2ES.10.41	The woman which appeared to you a little while ago, whom you saw mourning, and began to comfort her: 
2ES.10.42	but now see you the likeness of the woman no more, but there appeared to you a city in building: 
2ES.10.43	and whereas she told you of the death of her son, this is the solution: 
2ES.10.44	This woman, whom you saw, is
2ES.10.45	and whereas she said to you, that she has been thirty years barren, 
2ES.10.46	And it came to pass after three
2ES.10.47	And whereas she told you that she nourished him with travail: that was the dwelling in Jerusalem. 
2ES.10.48	And whereas she said to you, My son coming into his marriage chamber died, and that misfortune befell her: this was the destruction that came to Jerusalem. 
2ES.10.49	And, behold, you saw her likeness, how she mourned for her son, and you began to comfort her for what has befallen her;
2ES.10.50	For now the Most High, seeing that you are grieved unfeignedly, and suffer from your whole heart for her, has showed you the brightness of her glory, and the attractiveness of her beauty: 
2ES.10.51	and therefore I bade you remain in the field where no house was built: 
2ES.10.52	for I knew that the Most High would show this to you. 
2ES.10.53	Therefore I commanded you to come into the field, where no foundation of any building was. 
2ES.10.54	For in the place wherein the city of the Most High was to be showed, the work of no man’s building could stand. 
2ES.10.55	Therefore fear you not, nor let your heart be affrighted, but go your way in, and see the beauty and greatness of the building, as much as your eyes be able to see: 
2ES.10.56	and then shall you hear as much as your ears may comprehend. 
2ES.10.57	For you are blessed above many, and with the Most High are called by name, like as but few. 
2ES.10.58	But tomorrow at night you shall remain here; 
2ES.10.59	and so shall the Most High show you those visions in dreams, of what the Most High will do to those who dwell upon earth in the last days. So I slept that night and another, like as he commanded me.
2ES.11.1	And it came to pass the second night that I saw a dream, and, behold, there came up from the sea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads. 
2ES.11.2	And I saw, and, behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of heaven blew on her,
2ES.11.3	And I saw, and out of her wings there grew 
2ES.11.4	But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greater than the other heads, yet rested it with them. 
2ES.11.5	Moreover I saw, and, behold, the eagle flew with her wings, to reign over the earth, and over those who dwell therein. 
2ES.11.6	And I saw how all things under heaven were subject to her, and no man spoke against her, no, not one creature upon earth. 
2ES.11.7	And I saw, and, behold, the eagle rose upon her talons, and uttered her voice to her wings, saying, 
2ES.11.8	Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, and watch by course: 
2ES.11.9	but let the heads be preserved for the last. 
2ES.11.10	And I saw, and, behold, the voice went not out of her heads, but from the midst of her body. 
2ES.11.11	And I counted
2ES.11.12	And I saw, and, behold, on the right side there arose one wing, and reigned over all the earth; 
2ES.11.13	and so it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and it appeared not, so that the place thereof appeared no more: and the next following rose up, and reigned, and it ruled a great time; 
2ES.11.14	and it happened, that when it reigned, the end of it came also, so that it appeared no more, like as the first. 
2ES.11.15	And, behold, there came a voice to it, and said, 
2ES.11.16	Hear you that have borne rule over the earth all this time: this I proclaim to you, before you shall appear no more, 
2ES.11.17	There shall none after you attain to your time, neither to the half thereof. 
2ES.11.18	Then arose the third, and had the rule as the others before, and it also appeared no more. 
2ES.11.19	So went it with all the wings one after another, as that every one bare rule, and then appeared no more. 
2ES.11.20	And I saw, and, behold, in process of time the
2ES.11.21	some also of them were set up, but ruled not. 
2ES.11.22	After this I saw, and, behold, the twelve wings appeared no more, nor two of the little wings: 
2ES.11.23	and there was no more left upon the eagle’s body, but the three heads that rested, and six little wings. 
2ES.11.24	And I saw, and, behold, two little wings divided themselves from the six, and remained under the head that was upon the right side: but four remained in their place. 
2ES.11.25	And I saw, and, behold, these
2ES.11.26	And I saw, and, behold, there was one set up, but within a while it appeared no more. 
2ES.11.27	A second also, and it was sooner away than the first. 
2ES.11.28	And I saw, and, behold, the two that remained thought also in themselves to reign: 
2ES.11.29	and while they so thought, behold, there awaked one of the heads that were at rest, 
2ES.11.30	And I saw how it joined the two 
2ES.11.31	And, behold, the head was turned with those who were with it, and did eat up the two
2ES.11.32	But this head held the whole earth in possession, and bare rule over those that dwell therein with much oppression; and it had the governance of the world more than all the wings that had been. 
2ES.11.33	And after this I saw, and, behold, the head also that was in the midst suddenly appeared no more, like as the wings. 
2ES.11.34	But there remained the two heads, which also in like sort reigned over the earth, and over those that dwell therein. 
2ES.11.35	And I saw, and, behold, the head upon the right side devoured it that was upon the left side.
2ES.11.36	Then I heard a voice, which said to me, Look before you, and consider the thing that you see. 
2ES.11.37	And I saw, and, behold, as it were a lion roused out of the wood roaring: and I heard how that he sent out a man’s voice to the eagle, and spoke, saying, 
2ES.11.38	Hear you, I will talk with you, and the Most High shall say to you, 
2ES.11.39	Are not you it that remain of the four beasts, whom I made to reign in my world, that the end of my times might come through them? 
2ES.11.40	And the fourth came, and overcame all the beasts that were past, and held the world in governance with great trembling, and the whole compass of the earth with grievous oppression; and so long time lived he upon the earth with deceit. 
2ES.11.41	And you have judged the earth, but not with truth. 
2ES.11.42	For you have afflicted the meek, you have hurt the peaceful, you have hated those who speak truth, you have loved liars, and destroyed the dwellings of those who brought forth fruit, and cast down the walls of such as did you no harm. 
2ES.11.43	Therefore is your insolent dealing come up to the Most High, and your pride to the Mighty. 
2ES.11.44	The Most High also has looked upon his times, and, behold, they are ended, and his ages are fulfilled. 
2ES.11.45	And therefore appear no more, you eagle, nor your horrible wings, nor your evil little wings, nor your cruel heads, nor your hurtful talons, nor all your vain body: 
2ES.11.46	that all the earth may be refreshed, and be eased, being delivered from your violence, and that she may hope for the judgement and mercy of him that made her.
2ES.12.1	And it came to pass, whiles the lion spoke these words to the eagle, I saw, 
2ES.12.2	and, behold, the head that remained appeared no more, and
2ES.12.3	And I saw, and, behold, they appeared no more, and the whole body of the eagle was burnt, so that the earth was in great fear: then awaked I by reason of great ecstasy of mind, and from great fear, and said to my spirit, 
2ES.12.4	Behold, this have you done to me, in that you search out the ways of the Most High. 
2ES.12.5	Behold, I am yet weary in my mind, and very weak in my spirit; nor is there the least strength in me, for the great fear wherewith I was affrighted this night. 
2ES.12.6	Therefore I will now beseech the Most High, that he will strengthen me to the end. 
2ES.12.7	And I said, O Lord that bear rule, if I have found favour in your sight, and if I am justified with you above many others, and if my prayer indeed be come up before your face; 
2ES.12.8	strengthen me then, and show me your servant the interpretation and plain meaning of this fearful vision, that you may perfectly comfort my soul. 
2ES.12.9	For you have judged me worthy to show me the end of time and the last times.
2ES.12.10	And he said to me, This is the interpretation of this vision which you saw: 
2ES.12.11	The eagle, whom you saw come up from the sea, is the fourth kingdom which appeared in vision to your brother Daniel. 
2ES.12.12	But it was not expounded to him, as I now expound it to you or have expounded it. 
2ES.12.13	Behold, the days come, that there shall rise up a kingdom upon earth, and it shall be feared above all the kingdoms that were before it. 
2ES.12.14	Twelve kings will reign in it, one after another: 
2ES.12.15	whereof the second shall begin to reign, and shall have a longer time than 
2ES.12.16	This is the interpretation of the twelve wings, which you saw. 
2ES.12.17	And whereas you heard a voice which spoke, not going out from the heads, but from the midst of the body thereof, this is the interpretation: 
2ES.12.18	That
2ES.12.19	And whereas you saw the eight under wings sticking to her wings, this is the interpretation: 
2ES.12.20	That in it there shall arise eight kings, whose times shall be but small, and their years swift. 
2ES.12.21	And two of them shall perish, when the middle time approaches: four shall be kept for a while until the time of the ending thereof shall approach: but two shall be kept to the end. 
2ES.12.22	And whereas you saw three heads resting, this is the interpretation: 
2ES.12.23	In the last days thereof shall the Most High raise up three
2ES.12.24	and over those that dwell therein, with much oppression, above all those that were before them: therefore are they called the heads of the eagle. 
2ES.12.25	For these are those who shall accomplish her wickedness, and that shall finish her last end. 
2ES.12.26	And whereas you saw that the great head appeared no more, 
2ES.12.27	But for the two that remained, the sword shall devour them. 
2ES.12.28	For the sword of the one shall devour him that was with him: but he also shall fall by the sword in the last days. 
2ES.12.29	And whereas you saw two under wings passing
2ES.12.30	this is the interpretation: These are they, whom the Most High has kept to his end: this is the small kingdom and full of trouble, as you saw. 
2ES.12.31	And the lion, whom you saw rising up out of the wood, and roaring, and speaking to the eagle, and rebuking her for her unrighteousness, and all her words which you have heard; 
2ES.12.32	this is the anointed one, whom the Most High has kept to the end
2ES.12.33	For at the first he shall set them alive in his judgement, and when he has reproved them, he shall destroy them. 
2ES.12.34	For the rest of my people shall he deliver with mercy, those that have been preserved throughout my borders, and he shall make them joyful until the coming of the end, even the day of judgement, whereof I have spoken to you from the beginning. 
2ES.12.35	This is the dream that you saw, and this is the interpretation thereof: 
2ES.12.36	and you only have been meet to know the secret of the Most High. 
2ES.12.37	Therefore write all these things that you have seen in a book, and put them in a secret place: 
2ES.12.38	and you shall teach them to the wise of your people, whose hearts you know are able to comprehend and keep these secrets. 
2ES.12.39	But wait you here yourself yet seven days more, that there may be showed to you whatever it pleases the Most High to show you. And he departed from me.
2ES.12.40	And it came to pass, when all the people
2ES.12.41	What have we offended you? and what evil have we done against you, that you have utterly forsaken us, and sit in this place? 
2ES.12.42	For of all the prophets you only are left us, as a cluster of the vintage, and as a lamp in a dark place, and as a haven for a ship saved from the tempest. 
2ES.12.43	Are not the evils which are come to us sufficient? 
2ES.12.44	If you shall forsake us, how much better had it been for us, if we also had been consumed in the burning of Sion! 
2ES.12.45	For we are not better than those who died there. And they wept with a loud voice. And I answered them, and said, 
2ES.12.46	Be of good comfort, O Israel; and be not sorrowful, you house of Jacob: 
2ES.12.47	for the Most High has you in remembrance, and the Mighty has not forgotten you
2ES.12.48	As for me, I have not forsaken you, neither am I departed from you: but am come into this place, to pray for the desolation of Sion, and that I might seek mercy for the low estate of your sanctuary. 
2ES.12.49	And now go your way every man to his own house, and after these days I will come to you. 
2ES.12.50	So the people went their way into the city, like as I said to them: 
2ES.12.51	but I sat in the field seven days, as 
2ES.13.1	And it came to pass after seven days, I dreamt a dream by night: 
2ES.13.2	and, behold, there arose a wind from the sea, that it moved all the waves thereof. 
2ES.13.3	And I saw, and, behold,
2ES.13.4	And whenever the voice went out of his mouth, all they burnt that heard his voice, like as the
2ES.13.5	And after this I saw, and, behold, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of heaven, to make war against the man that came out of the sea. 
2ES.13.6	And I saw, and, behold, he carved himself a great mountain, and flew upon it. 
2ES.13.7	But I sought to see the region or place whereout the mountain was graven, and I could not. 
2ES.13.8	And after this I saw, and, behold, all they which were gathered together to fight against him were sore afraid, and yet dared fight. 
2ES.13.9	And, behold, as he saw the assault of the multitude that came, he neither lifted up his hand, nor held spear, nor any instrument of war: 
2ES.13.10	but only I saw how that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a flood of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast forth sparks
2ES.13.11	And these were all mixed together; the flood of fire, the flaming breath, and the great storm; and fell upon the assault of the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burnt them up every one, so that upon a sudden of an innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived, but only dust of ashes and smell of smoke: when I saw this I was amazed. 
2ES.13.12	Afterward I saw the same man come down from the mountain, and call to him another multitude which was peaceful. 
2ES.13.13	And there came
2ES.13.14	You have showed your servant these wonders from the beginning, and have counted me worthy that you should receive my prayer: 
2ES.13.15	and now show me moreover the interpretation of this dream. 
2ES.13.16	For as I conceive in my understanding, woe to those who shall be left in those days! and much more woe to those who are not left! 
2ES.13.17	for those who were not left shall be in heaviness, 
2ES.13.18	understanding the things that are laid up in the latter days, but not attaining to them. 
2ES.13.19	But woe to them also that are left, for this cause; for they shall see great perils and many necessities, like as these dreams declare. 
2ES.13.20	Yet is it
2ES.13.20	And he answered to me, and said, 
2ES.13.21	The interpretation of the vision shall I tell you, and I will also open to you the things whereof you have made mention. 
2ES.13.22	Whereas you have spoken of those who are left behind, this is the interpretation: 
2ES.13.23	He that shall
2ES.13.24	Know therefore, that they which be left behind are more blessed than those who are dead. 
2ES.13.25	These are the interpretations of the vision: Whereas you saw a man coming up from the midst of the sea, 
2ES.13.26	this is he whom the Most High has kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shall order those who are left behind. 
2ES.13.27	And whereas you saw, that out of his mouth there came wind, and fire, and storm; 
2ES.13.28	and whereas he held neither spear, nor any instrument of war, but destroyed the assault of that multitude which came to fight against him; this is the interpretation: 
2ES.13.29	Behold, the days come, when the Most High will begin to deliver those who are upon the earth. 
2ES.13.30	And there shall come astonishment of mind upon those who dwell on the earth. 
2ES.13.31	And one shall think to war against another, city against city, place against place, people against people, and kingdom against kingdom. 
2ES.13.32	And it shall be, when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I showed you before, then shall my Son be revealed, whom you saw 
2ES.13.33	And it shall be, when all the nations hear his voice, every man shall leave his own land and the battle they have one against another. 
2ES.13.34	And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as you saw, desiring to come, and to fight against him. 
2ES.13.35	But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion. 
2ES.13.36	And Sion shall come, and shall be showed to all men, being prepared and built, like as you saw the mountain graven without hands. 
2ES.13.37	And this my Son shall rebuke the nations which are come for their wickedness, 
2ES.13.38	and shall taunt them to their face with their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall be tormented, which are likened to a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by the law, which is likened to fire. 
2ES.13.39	And whereas you saw that he gathered to him another multitude that was peaceful; 
2ES.13.40	these are the ten tribes, which were led away out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmananser the king of the Assyrians led away captive, and he carried them beyond the River, and they were carried into another land. 
2ES.13.41	But they took this counsel amongst themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind lived, 
2ES.13.42	that they might there keep their statutes, which they had not kept in their own land. 
2ES.13.43	And they entered by the narrow passages of the river Euphrates. 
2ES.13.44	For the Most High then did signs for them, and stayed the springs of the River, till they were passed over. 
2ES.13.45	For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called
2ES.13.46	Then lived they there until the latter time; and now when they begin to come again, 
2ES.13.47	the Most High stays the springs of the River again, that they may go through: therefore saw you the multitude gathered together with peace. 
2ES.13.48	But those that be left behind of your people are those who are found within my holy border. 
2ES.13.49	It shall be therefore when he shall destroy the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he shall defend the people that remain. 
2ES.13.50	And then shall he show them very many wonders.
2ES.13.51	Then said I, O Lord that bear rule, show me this: wherefore I have seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea. 
2ES.13.52	And he said to me, like as one can neither seek out nor know what is in the deep of the sea, even so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the time of
2ES.13.53	This is the interpretation of the dream which you saw, and for this you only are enlightened herein. 
2ES.13.54	For you have forsaken your own 
2ES.13.55	Your life have you ordered in wisdom, and have called understanding your mother. 
2ES.13.56	And therefore have I showed you this; for there is a reward laid up with the Most High: and it shall be, after other three days I will speak other things to you, and declare to you mighty and wondrous things. 
2ES.13.57	Then went I forth and passed into the field, giving praise and thanks greatly to the Most High because of his wonders, which he did from time to time; 
2ES.13.58	and because he governs the time, and such things as fall in their seasons. And there I sat three days.
2ES.14.1	And it came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak, and, behold, there came a voice out of a bush near me, and said, Esdras, Esdras. 
2ES.14.2	And I said, Here am I, Lord. And I stood up upon my feet. 
2ES.14.3	Then said he to me, In the bush I did manifestly reveal myself, and talked with Moses, when my people were in bondage in Egypt: 
2ES.14.4	and I sent him, and
2ES.14.5	and told him many wondrous things, and showed him the secrets of the times, and the end of the seasons; and commanded him, saying, 
2ES.14.6	These words shall you publish openly, and these shall you hide. 
2ES.14.7	And now I say to you, 
2ES.14.8	Lay up in your heart the signs that I have showed, and the dreams that you have seen, and the interpretations which you have heard: 
2ES.14.9	for you shall be taken away from men, and from henceforth you shall remain with my Son, and with such as be like you, until the times be ended. 
2ES.14.10	For the world has lost its youth, and the times begin to wax old. 
2ES.14.11	 For the world is divided into twelve parts, and ten parts of it are gone already,
2ES.14.12	and there remain of it two parts after the middle of the tenth part. 
2ES.14.13	Now therefore set your house in order, and reprove your people, comfort the lowly amongst them,
2ES.14.14	and let go from the mortal thoughts, cast away from you the burdens of man, put off now your weak nature, 
2ES.14.15	and lay aside the thoughts that are most grievous to you, and haste you to remove from these times. 
2ES.14.16	For yet worse evils than those which you have seen happen shall be done hereafter. 
2ES.14.17	For look, how much the world shall be weaker through age, so much the more shall evils increase upon those who dwell therein. 
2ES.14.18	For the truth will withdraw itself further off, and falsehood will be hard at hand: for now hastens
2ES.14.19	Then answered I and said,
2ES.14.20	Behold, I will go, as you have commanded me, and reprove the people that now be: but those who shall be born afterward, who shall admonish them? for the world is set in darkness, and those who dwell therein are without light. 
2ES.14.21	For your law is burnt, therefore no man knows the things that are done of you, or the works that shall be done. 
2ES.14.22	But if I have found favour before you, send the Holy Spirit to me, and I shall write all that has been done in the world since the beginning, even the things that were written in your law, that men may be able to find the path, and that they which would live in the latter days may live. 
2ES.14.23	And he answered me and said, Go your way, gather the people together, and say to them, that they seek you not for forty days. 
2ES.14.24	But look you prepare you many tablets, and take with you Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ethanus, and Asiel, these five, which are ready to write swiftly; 
2ES.14.25	and come here, and I shall light a lamp of understanding in your heart, which shall not be put out, till the things be ended which you shall write. 
2ES.14.26	And when you have done, some things shall you publish openly, and some things shall you deliver in secret to the wise: tomorrow this hour shall you begin to write.
2ES.14.27	Then went I forth, as he commanded me, and gathered all the people together, and said, 
2ES.14.28	Hear these words, O Israel. 
2ES.14.29	Our fathers at the beginning were strangers in Egypt, and they were delivered from thence, 
2ES.14.30	and received the law of life, which they kept not, which you° also have transgressed after them. 
2ES.14.31	Then was
2ES.14.32	And forasmuch as he is a righteous judge, he took from you for a while the thing that he had given you. 
2ES.14.33	And now you° are here, and your kindred are amongst you. 
2ES.14.34	Therefore if so be that you° will rule over your own understanding, and instruct your hearts, you° shall be kept alive, and after death you° shall obtain mercy. 
2ES.14.35	For after death shall the judgement come, when we shall live again: and then shall the names of the righteous be manifest, and the works of the ungodly shall be declared. 
2ES.14.36	Let no man therefore come to me now, nor seek after me these forty days. 
2ES.14.37	So I took the five men, as he commanded me, and we went forth into the field, and remained there. 
2ES.14.38	And it came to pass on the next day that, behold, a voice called me, saying, Esdras, open your mouth, and drink what I give you to drink. 
2ES.14.39	Then opened I my mouth, and, behold, there was reached to me a full cup, which was full as it were with water, but the colour of it was like fire. 
2ES.14.40	And I took it, and drank: and when I had drunk of it, my heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in my breast, for my spirit retained its memory: 
2ES.14.41	and my mouth was opened, and shut no more. 
2ES.14.42	The Most High gave understanding to the five men, and they wrote by course the things that were told them, in
2ES.14.43	As for me, I spoke in the day, and by night I held not my tongue. 
2ES.14.44	So in forty days were written
2ES.14.45	And it came to pass, when the forty days were fulfilled, that the Most High spoke to me, saying, The first that you have written publish openly, and let the worthy and unworthy read it: 
2ES.14.46	but keep the seventy last, that you may deliver them to such as be wise amongst your people: 
2ES.14.47	for in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of knowledge. 
2ES.14.48	And I did so.
2ES.15.1	Behold, speak you in the ears of my people the words of prophecy, which I will put in your mouth, says the Lord: 
2ES.15.2	and cause you them to be written in paper: for they are faithful and true. 
2ES.15.3	Don’t be afraid of their imaginations against you, don’t let the unbelief of them that speak against you trouble you. 
2ES.15.4	For all the unbelievers shall die in their unbelief.
2ES.15.5	Behold, says the Lord, I bring evils upon the whole earth; sword and famine, and death and destruction. 
2ES.15.6	For wickedness has prevailed over every land, and their hurtful works are come to the full. 
2ES.15.7	Therefore says the Lord, 
2ES.15.8	I will hold my peace no more as touching their wickedness, which they profanely commit, neither will I suffer them in these things, which they wickedly practise: behold, the innocent and righteous blood cries to me, and the souls of the righteous cry out continually. 
2ES.15.9	I will surely avenge them, says the Lord, and will receive to me all the innocent blood from amongst them. 
2ES.15.10	Behold, my people is led as a flock to the slaughter: I will not suffer them now to dwell in the land of Egypt: 
2ES.15.11	but I will bring them out with a mighty hand and with a high arm, and will strike Egypt with plagues, as aforetime, and will destroy all the land thereof. 
2ES.15.12	Let Egypt mourn, and the foundations thereof, for the plague of the chastisement and the punishment that God shall bring upon it. 
2ES.15.13	Let the farmers that till the ground mourn: for their seeds shall fail and their trees shall be laid waste through the blasting and hail, and a terrible star. 
2ES.15.14	Woe to the world and those who dwell therein! 
2ES.15.15	for the sword and their destruction draws near, and nation shall rise up against nation to battle with weapons in their hands. 
2ES.15.16	For there shall be sedition amongst men; and waxing strong one against another, they shall not regard their king nor the chief of their great ones, in their might. 
2ES.15.17	For a man shall desire to go into a city, and shall not be able. 
2ES.15.18	For because of their pride the cities shall be troubled, the houses shall be destroyed, 
2ES.15.19	A man shall have no pity upon his neighbour, but shall make an assault on their houses with the sword, and plunder their goods, because of the lack of bread, and for great suffering.
2ES.15.20	Behold, says God, I call together all the kings of the earth, to stir up those who are from the rising of the sun, from the south, from the east, and Libanus; to turn themselves one against another, and repay the things that they have done to them. 
2ES.15.21	Just as they do yet this day to my chosen, so I will do also, and recompense in their bosom. The Lord God says: 
2ES.15.22	My right hand shall not spare the sinners, and my sword shall not cease over those who shed innocent blood upon the earth. 
2ES.15.23	And a fire is gone forth from his wrath, and has consumed the foundations of the earth, and the sinners, like the straw that is kindled. 
2ES.15.24	Woe to those who sin, and keep not my commandments! says the Lord. 
2ES.15.25	I will not spare them: go your way, you° rebellious children, defile not my sanctuary. 
2ES.15.26	For the Lord knows all those who trespass against him, therefore has he delivered them to death and destruction. 
2ES.15.27	For now are the evils come upon the whole earth, and you° shall remain in them: for God shall not deliver you, because you° have sinned against him.
2ES.15.28	Behold, a vision horrible, and the appearance thereof from the east! 
2ES.15.29	And the nations of the dragons of Arabia shall come out with many chariots, and from the day that they set forth the hissing of them is carried over the earth, so that all they which shall hear them may fear also and tremble. 
2ES.15.30	Also the Carmonians raging in wrath shall go forth as the wild boars of the wood, and with great power shall they come, and join battle with them, and shall waste a portion of the land of the Assyrians with their teeth. 
2ES.15.31	And then shall the dragons have the upper hand, remembering their
2ES.15.32	then these shall be troubled, and keep silence through their power, and shall turn and flee. 
2ES.15.33	And from the land of the Assyrians shall the lier in wait besiege them, and consume one of them, and upon their army shall be fear and trembling, and sedition against their kings. 
2ES.15.34	Behold, clouds from the east and from the north to the south, and they are very horrible to look upon, full of wrath and storm. 
2ES.15.35	They shall dash one against another, and they shall pour out a plentiful
2ES.15.36	and to the thigh of man, and to the camel’s hough. 
2ES.15.37	And there shall be fearfulness and great trembling upon earth: and they that see that wrath shall be afraid, and trembling shall take hold upon them. 
2ES.15.38	And after this shall there be stirred up great storms from the south, and from the north, and another part from the west. 
2ES.15.39	And strong winds shall arise from the east, and shall shut it up, even the cloud which he raised up in wrath; and the star that was to cause destruction by the east wind shall be violently driven towards the south and west. 
2ES.15.40	And great clouds and mighty and full of wrath shall be lifted up, and the star, that they may destroy all the earth, and those who dwell therein; and they shall pour out over every high and eminent one a terrible star, 
2ES.15.41	fire, and hail, and flying swords, and many waters, that all plains may be full, and all rivers, with the abundance of those waters. 
2ES.15.42	And they shall break down the cities and walls, mountains and hills, trees of the wood, and grass of the meadows, and their corn. 
2ES.15.43	And they shall go on steadfastly to Babylon, and destroy her. 
2ES.15.44	They shall come to her, and compass her about; the star and all wrath shall they pour out upon her: then shall the dust and smoke go up to the heaven, and all those who are about her shall bewail her. 
2ES.15.45	And those who remain shall do service to those who have put her in fear.
2ES.15.46	And you, Asia, that are partaker in the beauty of Babylon, and in the glory of her person: 
2ES.15.47	woe to you, you wretch, because you have made yourself like to her; you have decked your daughters in whoredom, that they might please and glory in your lovers, which have always desired you to commit whoredom withal! 
2ES.15.48	You have followed her that is hateful in all her works and inventions: therefore says God, 
2ES.15.49	I will send evils upon you; widowhood, poverty, famine, sword, and pestilence, to waste your houses to destruction and death. 
2ES.15.50	And the glory of your power shall be dried up as a flower, when the heat shall arise that is sent over you. 
2ES.15.51	You shall be weakened as a poor woman with stripes, and as one chastened with wounds, so that your mighty ones and 
2ES.15.52	Would I with jealousy have so proceeded against you, says the Lord, 
2ES.15.53	if you had not always slain my chosen, exalting the stroke of your hands, and saying over their
2ES.15.54	Set forth the beauty of your countenance? 
2ES.15.55	The reward of a prostitute shall be in your bosom, therefore shall you receive recompense. 
2ES.15.56	Just as you shall do to my chosen, says the Lord, even so shall God do to you, and shall deliver you into mischief. 
2ES.15.57	And your children shall die of hunger, and you shall fall by the sword: and your cities shall be broken down, and all your shall perish by the sword in the field. 
2ES.15.58	And those who are in the mountains shall die of hunger, and eat their own flesh, and drink 
2ES.15.59	You unhappy above all shall come and shall again receive evils. 
2ES.15.60	And in the passage they shall rush on the
2ES.15.61	And you shall be cast down by them as stubble, and they shall be to you as fire; 
2ES.15.62	and shall devour you, and your cities, your land, and your mountains; all your woods and your fruitful trees shall they burn up with fire. 
2ES.15.63	They shall carry your children away captive, and shall plunder your wealth, and mar the glory of your face.
2ES.16.1	Woe to you, Babylon, and Asia! woe to you, Egypt, and Syria! 
2ES.16.2	Gird up yourselves with sackcloth and garments of hair, and bewail your children, and lament; for your destruction is at hand. 
2ES.16.3	A sword is sent upon you, and who is he that may turn it back? 
2ES.16.4	A fire is sent upon you, and who is he that may quench it? 
2ES.16.5	Evils are sent upon you, and who is he that may drive them away? 
2ES.16.6	May one drive away a hungry lion in the wood? or may one quench the fire in stubble, when it has once begun to burn? 
2ES.16.7	May one turn again the arrow that is shot of a strong archer? 
2ES.16.8	The Lord God sends the evils, and who shall drive them away? 
2ES.16.9	A fire shall go forth from his wrath, and who is he that may quench it? 
2ES.16.10	He shall cast lightning, and who shall not fear? he shall thunder, and who shall not tremble? 
2ES.16.11	The Lord shall threaten, and who shall not be utterly broken in pieces at his presence? 
2ES.16.12	The earth quakes, and the foundations thereof; the sea arises up with waves from the deep, and the waves of it shall be troubled, and the fishes thereof also, at the presence of the Lord, and before the glory of his power: 
2ES.16.13	for strong is his right hand that bends the bow, his arrows that he shoots are sharp, and shall not miss, when they begin to be shot into the ends of the world. 
2ES.16.14	Behold, the evils are sent forth, and shall not return again, until they come upon the earth. 
2ES.16.15	The fire is kindled, and shall not be put out, till it consume the foundations of the earth. 
2ES.16.16	Just as an arrow which is shot of a mighty archer returns not backward, even so the evils that are sent forth upon earth shall not return again. 
2ES.16.17	Woe is me! woe is me! who will deliver me in those days?
2ES.16.18	The beginning of sorrows, and 
2ES.16.19	Behold, famine and plague, suffering and anguish! they are sent as scourges for amendment. 
2ES.16.20	But for all these things they shall not turn them from their wickedness, nor be always mindful of the scourges. 
2ES.16.21	Behold, food shall be so good cheap upon earth, that they shall think themselves to be in good case, and even then shall evils grow upon earth, sword, famine, and great confusion. 
2ES.16.22	For many of those who dwell upon earth shall perish of famine; and the other, that escape the famine, shall the sword destroy. 
2ES.16.23	And the dead shall be cast out as dung, and there shall be no man to comfort them: for the earth shall be left desolate, and the cities thereof shall be cast down. 
2ES.16.24	There shall be no husbandman left to till the earth, and to sow it. 
2ES.16.25	The trees shall give fruit, and who shall gather them? 
2ES.16.26	The grapes shall ripen, and who shall tread them? for in 
2ES.16.27	for one man shall desire to see another, or to hear his voice. 
2ES.16.28	For of a city there shall be ten left, and two of the field, which have hidden themselves in the thick groves, and in the clefts of the rocks. 
2ES.16.29	As in an orchard of olives upon every tree there be left three or four olives, 
2ES.16.30	or as when a vineyard is gathered there be some clusters left by those who diligently seek through the vineyard; 
2ES.16.31	even so in those days there shall be three or four left by those who search their houses with the sword. 
2ES.16.32	And the earth shall be left desolate, and the fields thereof shall be for briers, and her ways and all her paths shall bring forth thorns, because no sheep shall pass therethrough. 
2ES.16.33	The virgins shall mourn, having no bridegrooms; the women shall mourn, having no husbands; their daughters shall mourn, having no helpers. 
2ES.16.34	In the wars shall their bridegrooms be destroyed, and their husbands shall perish of famine.
2ES.16.35	Hear now these things, and understand them, you° servants of the Lord. 
2ES.16.36	Behold, the word of the Lord, receive it: disbelieve not the things whereof the Lord speaks. 
2ES.16.37	Behold, the evils draw near, and are not slack. 
2ES.16.38	Just as a woman with child in the ninth month, when the hour of her delivery draws near, within two or three hours doleful pains surround her womb, and when the child comes forth from the womb, there shall be no waiting for a moment: 
2ES.16.39	even so shall not the evils be slack to come upon the earth, and the world shall groan, and sorrows shall take hold of it on every side. 
2ES.16.40	O my people, hear my word: make you ready to the battle, and in those evils be even as pilgrims upon the earth. 
2ES.16.41	He that sells, let him be as he that flees away: and he that buys, as one that will lose: 
2ES.16.42	he that occupies merchandise, as he that has no profit by it: and he that builds, as he that shall not dwell therein: 
2ES.16.43	he that sows, as if he should not reap: so also he that prunes 
2ES.16.44	those who marry, as those who shall get no children; and those who marry not, as the widowed. 
2ES.16.45	Inasmuch as those who labour labour in vain; 
2ES.16.46	for strangers shall reap their fruits, and plunder their goods, overthrow their houses, and take their children captive, for in captivity and famine shall they beget their children: 
2ES.16.47	and those who traffick traffick to become a plunder: the more they deck their cities, their houses, their possessions, and their own persons, 
2ES.16.48	the more I will hate them for their sins, says the Lord. 
2ES.16.49	Just as a right honest and virtuous woman hates a prostitute, 
2ES.16.50	so shall righteousness hate iniquity, when she decks herself, and shall accuse her to her face, when he comes that shall defend him that diligently searches out every sin upon earth.
2ES.16.51	Therefore be you° not like thereto, nor to the works thereof. 
2ES.16.52	For yet a little while, and iniquity shall be taken away out of the earth, and righteousness shall reign over us. 
2ES.16.53	Let not the sinner say that he has not sinned: for he shall burn coals of fire upon his head, which says, I have not sinned before God and his glory. 
2ES.16.54	Behold, the Lord knows all the works of men, their imaginations, their thoughts, and their hearts. 
2ES.16.55	Who said, Let the earth be made; and it was made: Let the heaven be made; and it was made. 
2ES.16.56	And at his word were the stars established, and he knows the number of the stars. 
2ES.16.57	Who searches the deep, and the treasures thereof; he has measured the sea, and what it contains. 
2ES.16.58	Who has shut the sea in the midst of the waters, and with his word has he hanged the earth upon the waters. 
2ES.16.59	Who spreads out the heaven like a vault; upon the waters has he founded it. 
2ES.16.60	Who has made in the desert springs of water, and pools upon the tops of the mountains, to send forth rivers from the height to water the earth. 
2ES.16.61	Who framed man, and put a heart in the midst of the body, and gave him breath, life, and understanding, 
2ES.16.62	yes, the spirit of God Almighty. He who made all things, and searches out hidden things in hidden places, 
2ES.16.63	surely he knows your imagination, and what you° think in your hearts. Woe to those who sin, and would fain hide their sin! 
2ES.16.64	Forasmuch as the Lord will exactly search out all your works, and he will put you all to shame. 
2ES.16.65	And when your sins are brought forth before men, you° shall be ashamed, and your own iniquities shall stand as your accusers in that day. 
2ES.16.66	What will you° do? or how will you° hide your sins before God and his angels? 
2ES.16.67	Behold, God is the judge, fear him: leave off from your sins, and forget your iniquities, to meddle no more with them forever: so shall God lead you forth, and deliver you from all suffering.
2ES.16.68	For, behold, the burning wrath of a great multitude is kindled over you, and they shall take away certain of you, and feed you with that which is slain to idols. 
2ES.16.69	And those who consent to them shall be had in derision and in reproach, and be trodden under foot of them. 
2ES.16.70	For there shall be
2ES.16.71	They shall be like mad men, sparing none, but spoiling and destroying those who still fear the Lord. 
2ES.16.72	For they shall waste and take away their goods, and cast them out of their houses. 
2ES.16.73	Then shall be manifest the trial of my elect; even as the gold that is tried in the fire. 
2ES.16.74	Hear, O you° my elect, says the Lord: behold, the days of suffering are at hand, and I will deliver you from them. 
2ES.16.75	Be you° not afraid, neither doubt; for God is your guide: 
2ES.16.76	and you° who keep my commandments and precepts, says the Lord God, don’t let your sins weigh you down, and don’t let your iniquities lift up themselves. 
2ES.16.77	Woe to those who are fast bound with their sins, and covered with their iniquities, like as a field is fast bound with bushes, and the path thereof covered with thorns, that no man may travel through! 
2ES.16.78	 It is even shut off, and given up to be consumed of fire.
MAN.1.1	O 
MAN.1.2	who have made heaven and earth, with all the
MAN.1.3	who have bound the sea by the word of your commandment; who have shut up the deep, and sealed it by your terrible and glorious name; 
MAN.1.4	whom all things fear, yes, tremble before your power; 
MAN.1.5	for the majesty of your glory can’t be borne, and the anger of your threatening towards sinners is importable: 
MAN.1.6	your merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; 
MAN.1.7	for you are the Lord Most High, of great compassion, patient and abundant in mercy, and repent
MAN.1.8	You, O Lord, according to your great goodness have promised repentance and forgiveness to those who have sinned against you: and of your infinite mercies have appointed repentance to sinners, that they may be saved. You therefore, O Lord, that are the God of the just, have not appointed repentance to the just, to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against you; but you have appointed repentance to me that am a sinner: 
MAN.1.9	for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions are multiplied,
MAN.1.10	I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I can’t lift up my head
MAN.1.11	Now therefore I bow the knee of my heart, beseeching you of grace. 
MAN.1.12	I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge my iniquities: 
MAN.1.13	but, I humbly beseech you, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with my iniquities. Be not angry with me forever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me into the lower parts of the earth. For you,
MAN.1.14	and in me you will show all your goodness: for you will save me, that am unworthy, according to your great mercy. 
MAN.1.15	And I will praise you forever all the days of my life: for all the army of heaven sings your praise, and yours is the glory forever and ever. Amen.
3MA.1.1	Now Philopater, on learning from those who came back that Antiochus had made himself master of the places which belonged to himself, sent orders to all his footmen and horsemen, took with him his sister Arsinoe, and marched out as far as the parts of Raphia, where Antiochus and his forces encamped. 
3MA.1.2	And one Theodotus, intending to carry out his design, took with him the bravest of the armed men who had been before committed to his trust by Ptolemy, and got through at night to the tent of Ptolemy, to kill him on his own responsibility, and so to end the war. 
3MA.1.3	But Dositheus, called the son of Drimulus, by birth a Jew, afterward a renegade from the laws and observances of his country, conveyed Ptolemy away, and made an obscure person lie down in his stead in the tent. It befell this man to receive the fate which was meant for the other. 
3MA.1.4	A fierce battle then took place; and the men of Antiochus prevailing, Arsinoe continually went up and down the ranks, and with dishevelled hair, with tears and entreaties, begged the soldiers to fight manfully for themselves, their children, and wives; and promised that if they proved conquerors, she would give them each two minas of gold. 
3MA.1.5	It thus fell out that their enemies were defeated in hand-to-hand encounter, and that many of them were taken prisoners. 
3MA.1.6	Having vanquished this attempt, the king then decided to proceed to the neighbouring cities, and encourage them. 
3MA.1.7	By doing this, and by making donations to their temples, he inspired his subjects with confidence. 
3MA.1.8	The Jews sent some of their council and of their elders to him. The greetings, guest-gifts, and congratulations of the past, bestowed by them, filled him with the greater eagerness to visit their city. 
3MA.1.9	Having arrived at Jerusalem, sacrificed, and offered thank-offerings to the Greatest God, and done whatever else was suitable to the sanctity of the place, and entered the inner court, 
3MA.1.10	he was so struck with the magnificence of the place, and so wondered at the orderly arrangements of the temple, that he considered entering the sanctuary itself. 
3MA.1.11	And when they told him that this was not permissible, none of the nation, no, nor even the priests in general, but only the supreme high priest of all, and he only once in a year, being allowed to go in, he would by no means give way. 
3MA.1.12	Then they read the law to him; but he persisted in obtruding himself, exclaiming, that he ought to be allowed: and saying Be it that they were deprived of this honour, I ought not to be. 
3MA.1.13	And he put the question, Why, when he entered all the temples, none of the priests who were present forbade him? 
3MA.1.14	He was thoroughly answered by some one, That he did wrong to boast of this. 
3MA.1.15	Well; since I have done this, said he, be the cause what it may, shall I not enter with or without your consent? 
3MA.1.16	And when the priests fell down in their sacred vestments imploring the Greatest God to come and help in time of need, and to avert the violence of the fierce aggressor, and when they filled the temple with lamentations and tears, 
3MA.1.17	then those who had been left behind in the city were scared, and rushed forth, uncertain of the event. 
3MA.1.18	Virgins, who had been shut up within their chambers, came out with their mothers, scattering dust and ashes on their heads, and filling the streets with outcries. 
3MA.1.19	Women, but recently separated off, left their bridal chambers, left the reserve that befitted them, and ran about the city in a disorderly manner. 
3MA.1.20	New-born babes were deserted by the mothers or nurses who waited upon them; some here, some there, in houses, or in fields; these now, with an ardour which could not be checked, swarmed into the Most High temple. 
3MA.1.21	Various were the prayers offered up by those who assembled in this place, on account of the unholy attempt of the king. 
3MA.1.22	Along with these there were some of the citizens who took courage, and would not submit to his obstinacy, and his intention of carrying out his purpose. 
3MA.1.23	Calling out to arms, and to die bravely in defence of the law of their fathers, they created a great uproar in the place, and were with difficulty brought back by the aged and the elders to the station of prayer which they had occupied before. 
3MA.1.24	During this time the multitude kept on praying. 
3MA.1.25	The elders who surrounded the king tried in many ways to divert his arrogant mind from the design which he had formed. 
3MA.1.26	He, in his hardened mood, insensible to all persuasion, was going onward with the view of carrying out this design. 
3MA.1.27	Yet even his own officers, when they saw this, joined the Jews in an appeal to Him who has all power, to aid in the present crisis, and not wink at such overweening lawlessness. 
3MA.1.28	Such was the frequency and the vehemence of the cry of the assembled crowd, that an indescribable noise ensued. 
3MA.1.29	Not the men only, but the very walls and floor seemed to sound forth; all things preferring dissolution rather than to see the place defiled.
3MA.2.1	Now was it that the high priest Simon bowed his knees near the holy place, and spread out his hands in reverent form, and uttered the following supplication: 
3MA.2.2	O Lord, Lord, King of the heavens, and Ruler of the whole creation, Holy amongst the holy, sole Governor, Almighty, give ear to us who are oppressed by a wicked and profane one, who celebrates in his confidence and strength. 
3MA.2.3	It is you, the Creator of all, the Lord of the universe, who are a righteous Governor, and judge all who act with pride and insolence. 
3MA.2.4	It was you who did destroy the former workers of unrighteousness, amongst whom were the giants, who trusted in their strength and daring, by covering them with a measureless flood. 
3MA.2.5	It was you who did make the Sodomites, those workers of exceedingly iniquity, men notorious for their vices, an example to after generations, when you did cover them with fire and brimstone. 
3MA.2.6	You did make known your power when you caused the bold Pharaoh, the enslaver of your people, to pass through the ordeal of many and diverse inflictions. 
3MA.2.7	And you rolled the depths of the sea over him, when he made pursuit with chariots, and with a multitude of followers, and gave a safe passage to those who put their trust in you, the Lord of the whole creation. 
3MA.2.8	These saw and felt the works of your hands, and praised you the Almighty. 
3MA.2.9	You, O King, when you created the illimitable and measureless earth, did choose out this city: you did make this place sacred to your name, albeit you need nothing: you did glorify it with your illustrious presence, after constructing it to the glory of your great and honourable name. 
3MA.2.10	And you did promise, out of love to the people of Israel, that should we fall away from you, and become afflicted, and then come to this house and pray, you would hear our prayer. 
3MA.2.11	Truly you are faithful and true. 
3MA.2.12	And when you did often aid our fathers when hard pressed, and in low estate, and delivered them out of gret dangers, 
3MA.2.13	see now, holy King, how through our many and great sins we are borne down, and made subject to our enemies, and are become weak and powerless. 
3MA.2.14	We being in this low condition, this bold and profane man seeks to dishonour this your holy place, consecrated out of the earth to the name of your Majesty. 
3MA.2.15	Your dwelling place, the heaven of heavens, is indeed unapproachable to men. 
3MA.2.16	But since it seemed good to you to exhibit your glory amongst your people Israel, you did sanctify this place. 
3MA.2.17	Punish us not by means of the uncleanness of their men, nor chastise us by means of their profanity; lest the lawless ones should boast in their rage, and exult in exuberant pride of speech, and say, 
3MA.2.18	We have trampled upon the holy house, as idolatrous houses are trampled upon. 
3MA.2.19	Blot out our iniquities, and do away with our errors, and show forth your compassion in this hour. 
3MA.2.20	Let your mercies quickly go before us. Grant us peace, that the cast down and broken hearted may praise you with their mouth. 
3MA.2.21	At that time God, who sees all things, who is beyond all Holy amongst the holy, heard that prayer, so suitable; and scourged the man greatly uplifted with scorn and insolence. 
3MA.2.22	Shaking him to and fro as a reed is shaken with the wind, he cast him upon the pavement, powerless, with limbs paralysed; by a righteous judgement deprived of the faculty of speech. 
3MA.2.23	His friends and bodyguards, beholding the swift recompense which had suddenly overtaken him, struck with exceeding terror, and fearing that he would die, speedily removed him. 
3MA.2.24	When in course of time he had come to himself, this severe check caused no repentance within him, but he departed with bitter threatenings. 
3MA.2.25	He proceeded to Egypt, grew worse in wickedness through his before mentioned companions in wine, who were lost to all goodness; 
3MA.2.26	and not satisfied with countless acts of impiety, his audacity so increased that he raised evil reports there, and many of his friends, watching his purpose attentively, joined in furthering his will. 
3MA.2.27	His purpose was to indict a public stigma upon our race; wherefore he erected a pillar at the tower-porch, and caused the following inscription to be engraved upon it: 
3MA.2.28	That entrance to their own temple was to be refused to all those who would not sacrifice; that all the Jews were to be registered amongst the common people; that those who resisted were to be forcibly seized and put to death; 
3MA.2.29	that those who were thus registered, were to be marked on their persons by the ivy-leaf symbol of Dionysus, and to be set apart with these limited rights. 
3MA.2.30	To do away with the appearance of hating them all, he had it written underneath, that if any of them should elect to enter the community of those initiated in the rites, these should have equal rights with the Alexandrians. 
3MA.2.31	Some of those who were over the city, therefore, abhorring any approach to the city of piety, unhesitatingly gave in to the king, and expected to derive some great honour from a future connection with him. 
3MA.2.32	A nobler spirit, however, prompted the majority to cling to their religious observances, and by paying money that they might live unmolested, these sought to escape the registration: 
3MA.2.33	cheerfully looking forward to future aid, they abhorred their own apostates, considering them to be national foes, and debarring them from the common usages of social intercourse.
3MA.3.1	On discovering this, so incensed was the wicked king, that he no longer confined his rage to the Jews in Alexandria. Laying his hand more heavily upon those who lived in the country, he gave orders that they should be quickly collected into one place, and most cruelly deprived of their lives. 
3MA.3.2	While this was going on, an invidious rumour was uttered abroad by men who had banded together to injure the Jewish race. The purport of their charge was, that the Jews kept them away from the ordinances of the law. 
3MA.3.3	Now, while the Jews always maintained a feeling of unwavering loyalty towards the kings, 
3MA.3.4	yet, as they worshipped God, and observed his law, they made certain distinctions, and avoided certain things. Hence some persons held them in odium; 
3MA.3.5	although, as they adorned their conversation with works of righteousness, they had established themselves in the good opinion of the world. 
3MA.3.6	What all the rest of mankind said, was, however, made of no account by the foreigners; 
3MA.3.7	who said much of the exclusiveness of the Jews with regard to their worship and meats; they alleged that they were men unsociable, hostile to the king’s interests, refusing to associate with him or his troops. By this way of speaking, they brought much odium upon them. 
3MA.3.8	Nor was this unexpected uproar and sudden conflux of people unobserved by the Greeks who lived in the city, concerning men who had never harmed them: yet to aid them was not in their power, since all was oppression around; but they encouraged them in their troubles, and expected a favourable turn of affairs: 
3MA.3.9	He who knows all things, will not, 
3MA.3.10	Some of the neighbours, friends, and fellow dealers of the Jews, even called them secretly to an interview, pledged them their assistance, and promised to do their very utmost for them. 
3MA.3.11	Now the king, elated with his prosperous fortune, and not regarding the superior power of God, but thinking to persevere in his present purpose, wrote the following letter to the prejudice of the Jews. 
3MA.3.12	King Ptolemy Philopater, to the commanders and soldiers in Egypt, and in all places, health and happiness! 
3MA.3.13	I am right well; and so, too, are my affairs. 
3MA.3.14	Since our Asiatic campaign, the particulars of which you° know, and which by the aid of the gods, not lightly given, and by our own vigour, has been brought to a successful issue according to our expectation, 
3MA.3.15	we resolved, not with strength of spear, but with gentleness and much humanity, as it were to nurse the inhabitants of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and to be their willing benefactors. 
3MA.3.16	So, having bestowed considerable sums of money upon the temples of the several cities, we proceeded even as far as Jerusalem; and went up to honour the temple of these wretched beings who never cease from their folly. 
3MA.3.17	To outward appearance they received us willingly; but belied that appearance by their deeds. When we were eager to enter their temple, and to honour it with the most beautiful and exquisite gifts, 
3MA.3.18	they were so carried away by their old arrogance, as to forbid us the entrance; while we, out of our forbearance towards all men, refrained from exercising our power upon them. 
3MA.3.19	And thus, exhibiting their enmity against us, they alone amongst the nations lift up their heads against kings and benefactors, as men unwilling to submit to any thing reasonable. 
3MA.3.20	We then, having endeavored to make allowance for the madness of these persons, and on our victorious return treating all people in Egypt courteously, acted in a manner which was befitting. 
3MA.3.21	Accordingly, bearing no ill-will against their kinsmen 
3MA.3.22	All this, however, they have taken in a very different spirit. With their innate malignity, they have spurned the fair offer; and constantly inclining to evil, 
3MA.3.23	have rejected the inestimable rights. Not only so, but by using speech, and by refraining from speech, they abhor the few amongst them who are heartily disposed towards us; ever deeming that their ignoble course of procedure will force us to do away with our reform. 
3MA.3.24	Having then, received certain proofs that these 
3MA.3.25	As soon, therefore, as the contents of this letter become known to you, in that same hour we order those 
3MA.3.26	For by the punishment of them in one body we perceive that we have found the only means of establishing our affairs for the future on a firm and satisfactory basis. 
3MA.3.27	Whosoever shall shield a Jew, whether it be old man, child, or nursing baby, shall with his whole house be tortured to death. 
3MA.3.28	Whoever shall inform against the 
3MA.3.29	Whatever place shall shelter a Jew, shall, when he is hunted forth, be put under the ban of fire, and be forever rendered useless to every living being for all time to come. 
3MA.3.30	Such was the purport of the king’s letter.
3MA.4.1	Wherever this decree was received, the people kept up a revelry of joy and shouting; as if their long-pent-up, hardened hatred, were now to show itself openly. 
3MA.4.2	The Jews suffered great throes of sorrow, and wept much; while their hearts, all things around being lamentable, were set on fire as they bewailed the sudden destruction which was decreed against them. 
3MA.4.3	What home, or city, or place at all inhabited, or what streets were there, which their condition didn’t fill with wailing and lamentation? 
3MA.4.4	They were sent out unanimously by the generals in the several cities, with such stern and pitiless feeling, that the exceptional nature of the infliction moved even some of their enemies. These, influenced by sentiments of common humanity, and reflecting upon the uncertain issue of life, shed tears at this their miserable expulsion. 
3MA.4.5	A multitude of aged hoary-haired old men, were driven along with halting bending feet, urged onward by the impulse of a violent, shameless force to quick speed. 
3MA.4.6	Girls who had entered the bridal chamber quite lately, to enjoy the partnership of marriage, exchanged pleasure for misery; and with dust scattered upon their myrrh-anointed heads, were hurried along unveiled; and, in the midst of outlandish insults, set up with one accord a lamentable cry instead of the marriage hymn. 
3MA.4.7	Bound, and exposed to public gaze, they were hurried violently on board ship. 
3MA.4.8	The husbands of these, in the prime of their youthful vigour, instead of crowns wore halters round their necks; instead of feasting and youthful celebration, spent the rest of their nuptial days in wailing, and saw only the grave at hand. 
3MA.4.9	They were dragged along by unyielding chains, like wild beasts: of these, some had their necks thrust into the benches of the rowers; while the feet of others were enclosed in hard fetters. 
3MA.4.10	The planks of the deck above them blocked out the light, and shut out the day on every side, so that they might be treated like traitors during the whole voyage. 
3MA.4.11	They were conveyed accordingly in this vessel, and at the end of it arrived at Schedia. The king had ordered them to be cast into the vast hippodrome, which was built in front of the city. This place was well adapted by its situation to expose them to the gaze of all comers into the city, and of those who went from the city into the country. Thus they could hold no communication with his forces; no, were deemed unworthy of any civilized accommodation. 
3MA.4.12	When this was done, the king, hearing that their kindred in the city often went out and lamented the melancholy distress of these victims, 
3MA.4.13	was full of rage, and commanded that they should be carefully subjected to the same (and not one bit milder) treatment. 
3MA.4.14	The whole nation was now to be registered. Every individual was to be specified by name; not for that hard servitude of labour which we have a little before mentioned, but that he might expose them to the before-mentioned tortures; and finally, in the short space of a day, might extirpate them by his cruelties. 
3MA.4.15	The registering of these men was carried on cruelly, zealously, assiduously, from the rising of the sun to its going down, and was not brought to an end in forty days. 
3MA.4.16	The king was filled with great and constant joy, and celebrated banquets before the temple idols. His erring heart, far from the truth, and his profane mouth, gave glory to idols, deaf and incapable of speaking or aiding, and uttered unworthy speech against the Greatest God. 
3MA.4.17	At the end of the above-mentioned interval of time, the registrars brought word to the king that the multitude of the Jews was too great for registration, 
3MA.4.18	inasmuch as there were many still left in the land, of whom some were in inhabited houses, and others were scattered about in various places; so that all the commanders in Egypt were insufficient for the work. 
3MA.4.19	The king threatened them, and charged them with taking bribes, in order to contrive the escape of the Jews: but was clearly convinced of the truth of what had been said. 
3MA.4.20	They said, and proved, that paper and pens had failed them for the carrying out of their purpose. 
3MA.4.21	Now this was an active interference of the unconquerable Providence which assisted the Jews from heaven.
3MA.5.1	Then he called Hermon, who had charge of the elephants. Full of rage, altogether fixed in his furious design, 
3MA.5.2	he commanded him, with a quantity of unmixed wine and handfuls of incense 
3MA.5.3	The king, after issuing these orders, went to his feasting, and gathered together all those of his friends and of the army who hated the Jews the most. 
3MA.5.4	The master of the elephants, Hermon, fulfilled his commission punctually. 
3MA.5.5	The underlings appointed for the purpose went out about evening and bound the hands of the miserable victims, and took other precautions for their security at night, thinking that the whole race would perish together. 
3MA.5.6	The heathen believed the Jews to be destitute of all protection; for chains fettered them about. 
3MA.5.7	they invoked the Almighty Lord, and ceaselessly implored with tears their merciful God and Father, Ruler of all, Lord of every power, 
3MA.5.8	to overthrow the evil purpose which was gone out against them, and to deliver them by extraordinary manifestation from that death which was in store for them. 
3MA.5.9	Their litany so earnest went up to heaven. 
3MA.5.10	Then Hermon, who had filled his merciless elephants with copious draughts of mixed wine and frankincense, came early to the palace to certify the kind thereof. 
3MA.5.11	He, however, who has sent his good creature sleep from all time by night or by day thus gratifying whom he wills, diffused a portion thereof now upon the king. 
3MA.5.12	By this sweet and profound influence of the Lord he was held fast, and thus his unjust purpose was quite frustrated, and his unflinching resolve greatly falsified. 
3MA.5.13	But the Jews, having escaped the hour which had been fixed, praised their holy God, and again prayed him who is easily reconciled to display the power of his powerful hand to the overweening Gentiles. 
3MA.5.14	The middle of the tenth hour had well near arrived, when the person who sent invitations, seeing the guests who were invited present, came and shook the king. 
3MA.5.15	He gained his attention with difficulty, and hinting that the mealtime was getting past, talked the matter over with him. 
3MA.5.16	The king listened to this, and then turning aside to his potations, commanded the guests to sit down before him. 
3MA.5.17	This done, he asked them to enjoy themselves, and to indulge in mirth at this somewhat late hour of the banquet. 
3MA.5.18	Conversation grew on, and the king sent for Hermon, and enquired of him, with fierce denunciations, why the Jews had been allowed to outlive that day. 
3MA.5.19	Hermon explained that he had done his bidding over night; and in this he was confirmed by his friends. 
3MA.5.20	The king, then, with a barbarity exceeding that of Phalaris, said, That they might thank his sleep of that day. Lose no time, and get ready the elephants against tomorrow, as you did before, for the destruction of these accursed Jews. 
3MA.5.21	When the king said this, the company present were glad, and approved; and then each man went to his own home. 
3MA.5.22	Nor did they employ the night in sleep, so much as in contriving cruel mockeries for those deemed miserable. 
3MA.5.23	The morning cock had just crowed, and Hermon, having harnessed the brutes, was stimulating them in the great colonnade. 
3MA.5.24	The city crowds were collected together to see the hideous spectacle, and waited impatiently for the dawn. 
3MA.5.25	The Jews, breathless with momentary suspense, stretched forth their hands, and prayed the Greatest God, in mournful strains, again to help them speedily. 
3MA.5.26	The sun’s rays were not yet shed abroad, and the king was waiting for his friends, when Hermon came to him, calling him out, and saying, That his desires could now be realised. 
3MA.5.27	The king, receiving him, was astonished at his unwonted exit; and, overwhelmed with a spirit of oblivion about everything, enquired the object of this earnest preparation. 
3MA.5.28	But this was the working of that Almighty God who had made him forget all his purpose. 
3MA.5.29	Hermon, and all his friends, pointed out the preparation of the animals. They are ready, O king, according to your own strict injunction. 
3MA.5.30	The king was filled with fierce anger at these words; for, by the Providence of God regarding these things, his mind had become entirely confused. He looked hard at Hermon, and threatened him as follows: 
3MA.5.31	Your parents, or your children, were they here, to these wild beasts a large repast they should have furnished; not these innocent Jews, who me and my forefathers loyally have served. 
3MA.5.32	Had it not been for familiar friendship, and the claims of your office, your life should have gone for theirs. 
3MA.5.33	Hermon, being threatened in this unexpected and alarming manner, was troubled in visage, and depressed in countenance. 
3MA.5.34	The friends, too, stole out one by one, and dismissed the assembled multitudes to their respective occupations. 
3MA.5.35	The Jews, having heard of these events, praised the glorious God and King of kings, because they had obtained this help, too, from him. 
3MA.5.36	Now the king arranged another banquet after the same manner, and proclaimed an invitation to mirth. 
3MA.5.37	And he summoned Hermon to his presence, and said, with threats, How often, O wretch, must I repeat my orders to you about these same persons? 
3MA.5.38	Once more, arm the elephants for the extermination of the Jews tomorrow. 
3MA.5.39	His kinsmen, who were reclining with him, wondered at his instability, and thus expressed themselves: 
3MA.5.40	O king, how long do you make trial of us, as of men bereft of reason? This is the third time that you have ordered their destruction. When the thing is to be done, you change your mind, and recall your instructions. 
3MA.5.41	For this cause the feeling of expectation causes tumult in the city: it swarms with factions; and is continually on the point of being plundered. 
3MA.5.42	The king, just like another Phalaris, a prey to thoughtlessness, made no account of the changes which his own mind had undergone, issuing in the deliverance of the Jews. He swore a fruitless oath, and determined forthwith to send them to hades, crushed by the knees and feet of the elephants. 
3MA.5.43	He would also invade Judea, and level its towns with fire and the sword; and destroy that temple which the heathen might not enter, and prevent sacrifices ever after being offered up there. 
3MA.5.44	Joyfully his friends broke up, together with his kinsmen; and, trusting in his determination, arranged their forces in guard at the most convenient places of the city. 
3MA.5.45	And the master of the elephants urged the beasts into an almost maniacal state, drenched them with incense and wine, and decked them with frightful instruments. 
3MA.5.46	About early morning, when the city was now filled with an immense number of people at the hippodrome, he entered the palace, and called the king to the business in hand. 
3MA.5.47	The king’s heart teemed with impious rage; and he rushed forth with the mass, along with the elephants. With feelings unsoftened, and eyes pitiless, he longed to gaze at the hard and wretched doom of the above-mentioned 
3MA.5.48	But the 
3MA.5.49	thought that they had come to the last moment of their lives, to the end of what they had tremblingly expected. They gave way, therefore, to lamentations and moans: they kissed each other: those nearest of kin to each other hung about one another’s necks: fathers about their sons, mother their daughters: other women held their infants to their breasts, which drew what seemed their last milk. 
3MA.5.50	Nevertheless, when they reflected upon the help previously granted them from heaven, they prostrated themselves with one accord; removed even the sucking children from the breasts, and 
3MA.5.51	sent up an exceedingly great cry asking the Lord of all power to reveal himself, and have mercy upon those who now lay at the gates of hades.
3MA.6.1	And Eleazar, an illustrious priest of the country, who had attained to length of days, and whose life had been adorned with virtue, caused the elders who were around him to cease to cry out to the holy God, and prayed thus: 
3MA.6.2	O king, mighty in power, most high, Almighty God, who regulates the whole creation with your tender mercy, 
3MA.6.3	look upon the seed of Abraham, upon the children of the sanctified Jacob, your sanctified inheritance, O Father, now being wrongfully destroyed as strangers in a strange land. 
3MA.6.4	You destroyed Pharaoh, with his army of chariots, when that lord of this same Egypt was uplifted with lawless daring and loud-sounding tongue. Shedding the beams of your mercy upon the race of Israel, you did overwhelm him with his proud army. 
3MA.6.5	When Sennacherim, the grievous king of the Assyrians, exulting in his countless army, had subdued the whole land with his spear, and was lifting himself against your holy city, with boastings grievous to be endured, you, O Lord, did demolish him and did show forth your might to many nations. 
3MA.6.6	When the three friends in the land of Babylon of their own will exposed their lives to the fire rather than serve vain things, you did send a moist coolness through the fiery furnace, and bring the fire upon all their adversaries. 
3MA.6.7	It was you who, when Daniel was hurled, through slander and envy, as a prey to lions down below, did bring him back against unhurt to light. 
3MA.6.8	When Jonah was pining away in the belly of the sea-bred monster, you did look upon him, O Father, and recover him to the sight of his own. 
3MA.6.9	And now, you who hate insolence; you who do abound in mercy; you who are the protector of all things; appear quickly to those of the race of Israel, who are insulted by abhorred, lawless gentiles. 
3MA.6.10	If our life has during our exile been stained with iniquity, deliver us from the hand of the enemy, and destroy us, O Lord, by the death which you prefer. 
3MA.6.11	Let not the vain-minded congratulate vain idols at the destruction of your beloved, saying, Neither did their god deliver them. 
3MA.6.12	You, who are All-powerful and Almighty, O Eternal One, behold! have mercy upon us who are being withdrawn from life, like traitors, by the unreasoning insolence of lawless men. 
3MA.6.13	Let the heathen cower before your invincible might today, O glorious One, who have all power to save the race of Jacob. 
3MA.6.14	The whole band of infants and their parents with tears beseech you. 
3MA.6.15	Let it be shown to all the nations that you are with us, O Lord, and have not turned your face away from us; but as you said that you would not forget them even in the land of their enemies, so do you fulfil this saying, O Lord. 
3MA.6.16	Now, at the time that Eleazar had ended his prayer, the king came along to the hippodrome, with the wild beasts, and with his tumultuous power. 
3MA.6.17	When the Jews saw this, they uttered a loud cry to heaven, so that the adjacent valleys resounded, and caused an irrepressible lamentation throughout the army. 
3MA.6.18	Then the all-glorious, all-powerful, and true God, displayed his holy countenance, and opened the gates of heaven, from which two angels, dreadful of form, came down and were visible to all but the Jews. 
3MA.6.19	And they stood opposite, and filled the enemies’ army with confusion and cowardice; and bound them with immoveable fetters. 
3MA.6.20	And a cold shudder came over the person of the king, and oblivion paralysed the vehemence of his spirit. 
3MA.6.21	They turned back the animals upon the armed forces which followed them; and the animals trod them down, and destroyed them. 
3MA.6.22	The king’s wrath was converted into compassion; and he wept at his own machinations. 
3MA.6.23	For when he heard the cry, and saw them all on the verge of destruction, with tears he angrily threatened his friends, saying, 
3MA.6.24	You° have governed badly; and have exceeded tyrants in cruelty; and me your benefactor you° have laboured to deprive at once of my dominion and my life, by secretly devising measures injurious to the kingdom. 
3MA.6.25	Who has gathered here, unreasonably removing each from his home, those who, in fidelity to us, had held the fortresses of the country? 
3MA.6.26	Who has thus consigned to unmerited punishments those who in good will towards us from the beginning have in all things surpassed all nations, and who often have engaged in the most dangerous undertakings? 
3MA.6.27	Loose, loose the unjust bonds; send them to their homes in peace, and deprecate what has been done. 
3MA.6.28	Release the sons of the almighty living God of heaven, who from our ancestors’ times until now has granted a glorious and uninterrupted prosperity to our affairs. 
3MA.6.29	These things he said; and they, released the same moment, having now escaped death, praised God their holy Saviour. 
3MA.6.30	The king then departed to the city, and called his financier to him, and asked him provide a seven days’ quantity of wine and other materials for feasting for the Jews. He decided that they should keep a gladsome festival of deliverance in the very place in which they expected to meet with their destruction. 
3MA.6.31	Then they who were before despised and near to hades, yes, rather advanced into it, partook of the cup of salvation, instead of a grievous and lamentable death. Full of exultation, they parted out the place intended for their fall and burial into banqueting booths. 
3MA.6.32	Ceasing their miserable strain of woe, they took up the subject of their fatherland, hymning in praise God their wonder-working Saviour. All groans, all wailing, were laid aside: they formed dances in token of serene joy. 
3MA.6.33	So, also, the king collected a number of guests for the occasion, and returned unceasing thanks with much magnificence for the unexpected deliverance afforded him. 
3MA.6.34	Those who had marked them out as for death and for carrion, and had registered them with joy, howled aloud, and were clothed with shame, and had the fire of their rage ingloriously put out. 
3MA.6.35	But the Jews, as we just said, instituted a dance, and then gave themselves up to feasting, glad thanksgiving, and psalms. 
3MA.6.36	They made a public ordinance to commemorate these things for generations to come, as long as they should be sojourners. They thus established these days as days of mirth, not for the purpose of drinking or luxury, but because God had saved them. 
3MA.6.37	They requested the king to send them back to their homes. 
3MA.6.38	They were being enrolled from the twenty-fifth of Pachon to the fourth of Epiphi, a period of forty days: the measures taken for their destruction lasted from the fifth of Epiphi till the seventh, that is, three days. 
3MA.6.39	The Ruler over all did during this time manifest forth his mercy gloriously, and did deliver them all together unharmed. 
3MA.6.40	They feasted upon the king’s provision up to the fourteenth day, and then asked to be sent away. 
3MA.6.41	The king commended them, and wrote the following letter, of magnanimous import for them, to the commanders of every city.
3MA.7.1	King Ptolemy Philopator to the commanders throughout Egypt, and to all who are set over affairs, joy and strength. 
3MA.7.2	We, too, and our children are well; and God has directed our affairs as we wish. 
3MA.7.3	Certain of our friends did of malice vehemently urge us to punish the Jews of our realm in a body, with the infliction of a monstrous punishment. 
3MA.7.4	They pretended that our affairs would never be in a good state till this took place. Such, they said, was the hatred borne by the Jews to all other people. 
3MA.7.5	They brought them fettered in grievous chains as slaves, no, as traitors. Without enquiry or examination they endeavored to annihilate them. They buckled themselves with a savage cruelty, worse than Scythian custom. 
3MA.7.6	For this cause we severely threatened them; yet, with the clemency which we are wont to extend to all men, we at length permitted them to live. Finding that the God of heaven cast a shield of protection over the Jews so as to preserve them, and that he fought for them as a father always fights for his sons; 
3MA.7.7	and taking into consideration their constancy and fidelity towards us and towards our ancestors, we have, as we ought, acquitted them of every sort of charge. 
3MA.7.8	And we have dismissed them to their several homes; bidding all men everywhere to do them no wrong, or unrighteously revile them about the past. 
3MA.7.9	For know you°, that should we conceive any evil design, or in any way aggrieve them, we shall ever have as our opposite, not man, but the highest God, the ruler of all might. From Him there will be no escape, as the avenger of such deeds. Fare you° well. 
3MA.7.10	When they had received this letter, they were not forward to depart immediately. They petitioned the king to be allowed to inflict fitting punishment upon those of their race who had willingly transgressed the holy god, and the law of God. 
3MA.7.11	They alleged that men who had for their bellies’ sake transgressed the ordinances of God, would never be faithful to the interests of the king. 
3MA.7.12	The king admitted the truth of this reasoning, and commended them. Full power was given them, without warrant or special commission, to destroy those who had transgressed the law of God boldly in every part of the king’s dominions. 
3MA.7.13	Their priests, then, as it was meet, saluted him with good wishes, and all the people echoed with the Hallelujah. They then joyfully departed. 
3MA.7.14	Then they punished and destroyed with ignominy every polluted Jew that fell in their way; 
3MA.7.15	slaying thus, in that day, above three hundred men, and esteeming this destruction of the wicked a season of joy. 
3MA.7.16	They themselves having held fast their God to death, and having enjoyed a full deliverance, departed from the city garlanded with sweet-flowered wreaths of every kind. Uttering exclamations of joy, with songs of praise, and melodious hymns they thanked the God of their fathers, the eternal Saviour of Israel. 
3MA.7.17	Having arrived at Ptolemais, called from the specialty of that district Rose-bearing, where the fleet, in accordance with the general wish, waited for them seven days, 
3MA.7.18	they partook of a banquet of deliverance, for the king generously granted them severally the means of securing a return home. 
3MA.7.19	They were accordingly brought back in peace, while they gave utterance to becoming thanks; and they determined to keep these days during their sojourn as days of joyfulness. 
3MA.7.20	These they registered as sacred upon a pillar, when they had dedicated the place of their festivity to be one of prayer. They departed unharmed, free, abundant in joy, preserved by the king’s command, by land, by sea, and by river, each to his own home. 
3MA.7.21	They had more weight than before amongst their enemies; and were honoured and feared, and no one in any way robbed them of their goods. 
3MA.7.22	Every man received back his own, according to inventory; those who had obtained their goods, giving them up with the greatest terror. For the greatest God made perfect wonders for their salvation. 
3MA.7.23	Blessed be the Redeemer of Israel to everlasting. Amen.
4MA.1.1	As I am going to demonstrate a most philosophical proposition, namely, that religious reasoning is absolute master of the passions, I would willingly advise you to give the utmost heed to philosophy. 
4MA.1.2	For reason is necessary to every one as a step to science: and more especially does it embrace the praise of prudence, the highest virtue. 
4MA.1.3	If, then, reasoning appears to hold the mastery over the passions which stand in the way of temperance, such as gluttony and lust, 
4MA.1.4	it surely also and manifestly has the rule over the affections which are contrary to justice, such as malice; and of those which are hindrances to manliness, as wrath, and pain, and fear. 
4MA.1.5	How, then, is it, perhaps some may say, that reasoning, if it rule the affections, is not also master of forgetfulness and ignorance? They attempt a ridiculous argument. 
4MA.1.6	For reasoning does not rule over its own affections, but over such as are contrary to justice, and manliness and temperance, and prudence; and yet over these, so as to withstand, without destroying them. 
4MA.1.7	I might prove to you, from many other considerations, that religious reasoning is sole master of the passions; 
4MA.1.8	but I shall prove it with the greatest force from the fortitude of Eleazar, and seven kindred, and their mother, who suffered death in defence of virtue. 
4MA.1.9	For all these, treating pains with contempt even to death, by this contempt, demonstrated that reasoning has command over the passions. 
4MA.1.10	For their virtues, then, it is right that I should commend those men who died with their mother at this time in behalf of rectitude; and for their honours, I may count them happy. 
4MA.1.11	For they, winning admiration not only from men in general, but even from the persecutors, for their manliness and endurance, became the means of the destruction of the tyranny against their nation, having conquered the tyrant by their endurance, so that by them their country was purified. 
4MA.1.12	But we may now at once enter upon the question, having commenced, as is our wont, with laying down the doctrine, and so proceed to the account of these persons, giving glory to the all wise God. 
4MA.1.13	The question, therefore, is, whether reasoning be absolute master of the passions. 
4MA.1.14	Let’s determine, then, What is reasoning? and what passion? and how many forms of the passions? and whether reasoning bears sway over all of these? 
4MA.1.15	Reasoning is, then, intellect accompanied by a life of rectitude, putting foremost the consideration of wisdom. 
4MA.1.16	And wisdom is a knowledge of divine and human things, and of their causes. 
4MA.1.17	And this is contained in the education of the law; by means of which we learn divine things reverently, and human things profitably. 
4MA.1.18	And the forms of wisdom are prudence, and justice, and manliness, and temperance. 
4MA.1.19	The leading one of these is prudence; by whose means, indeed, it is that reasoning bears rule over the passions. 
4MA.1.20	Of the passions, pleasure and pain are the two most comprehensive; and they also by nature refer to the soul. 
4MA.1.21	And there are many attendant affections surrounding pleasure and pain. 
4MA.1.22	Before pleasure is lust; and after pleasure, joy. 
4MA.1.23	And before pain is fear; and after pain is sorrow. 
4MA.1.24	Wrath is an affection, common to pleasure and to pain, if any one will pay attention when it comes upon him. 
4MA.1.25	And there exists in pleasure a malicious disposition, which is the most multiform of all the affections. 
4MA.1.26	In the soul it is arrogance, and love of money, and vaingloriousness, and contention, and faithlessness, and the evil eye. 
4MA.1.27	In the body it is greediness and gormandizing, and solitary gluttony. 
4MA.1.28	As pleasure and pain are, therefore, two growth of the body and the soul, so there are many offshoots of these passions. 
4MA.1.29	And reasoning, the universal husbandman, purging, and pruning these severally, and binding round, and watering, and transplanting, in every way improves the materials of the morals and affections. 
4MA.1.30	For reasoning is the leader of the virtues, but it is the sole ruler of the passions. Observe then first, through the very things which stand in the way of temperance, that reasoning is absolute ruler of the passions. 
4MA.1.31	Now temperance consists of a command over the lusts. 
4MA.1.32	But of the lusts, some belong to the soul, others to the body: and over each of these classes the reasoning appears to bear sway. 
4MA.1.33	For whence is it, otherwise, that when urged on to forbidden meats, we reject the gratification which would ensue from them? Is it not because reasoning is able to command the appetites? I believe so. 
4MA.1.34	Hence it is, then, that when lusting after water-animals and birds, and four-footed beasts, and all kinds of food which are forbidden us by the law, we withhold ourselves through the mastery of reasoning. 
4MA.1.35	For the affections of our appetites are resisted by the temperate understanding, and bent back again, and all the impulses of the body are reined in by reasoning.
4MA.2.1	And what wonder? if the lusts of the soul, after participation with what is beautiful, are frustrated, 
4MA.2.2	on this ground, therefore, the temperate Joseph is praised in that by reasoning, he subdued, on reflection, the indulgence of sense. 
4MA.2.3	For, although young, and ripe for sexual intercourse, he abrogated by reasoning the stimulus of his passions. 
4MA.2.4	And it is not merely the stimulus of sensual indulgence, but that of every desire, that reasoning is able to master. 
4MA.2.5	For instance, the law says, You shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, nor anything that belongs to your neighbour. 
4MA.2.6	Now, then, since it is the law which has forbidden us to desire, I shall much the more easily persuade you, that reasoning is able to govern our lusts, just as it does the affections which are impediments to justice. 
4MA.2.7	Since in what way is a solitary eater, and a glutton, and a drunkard reclaimed, unless it be clear that reasoning is lord of the passions? 
4MA.2.8	A man, therefore, who regulates his course by the law, even if he be a lover of money, immediately puts force upon his own disposition; lending to the needy without interest, and cancelling the debt of the incoming Sabbath. 
4MA.2.9	And should a man be parsimonious, he is ruled by the law acting through reasoning; so that he does not glean his harvest crops, nor vintage: and in reference to other points we may perceive that it is reasoning that conquers his passions. 
4MA.2.10	For the law conquers even affection towards parents, not surrendering virtue on their account. 
4MA.2.11	And it prevails over marriage love, condemning it when transgressing law. 
4MA.2.12	And it lords it over the love of parents towards their children, for they punish them for vice; and it domineers over the intimacy of friends, reproving them when wicked. 
4MA.2.13	And think it not a strange assertion that reasoning can in behalf of the law conquer even enmity. 
4MA.2.14	It allows not to cut down the cultivated herbage of an enemy, but preserves it from the destroyers, and collects their fallen ruins. 
4MA.2.15	And reason appears to be master of the more violent passions, as love of empire and empty boasting, and slander. 
4MA.2.16	For the temperate understanding repels all these malignant passions, as it does wrath: for it masters even this. 
4MA.2.17	Thus Moses, when angered against Dathan and Abiram, did nothing to them in wrath, but regulated his anger by reasoning. 
4MA.2.18	For the temperate mind is able, as I said, to be superior to the passions, and to transfer some, and destroy others. 
4MA.2.19	For why, else, does our most wise father Jacob blame Simeon and Levi for having irrationally slain the whole race of the Shechemites, saying, Cursed be their anger. 
4MA.2.20	For if reasoning didn’t possess the power of subduing angry affections, he would not have spoken thus. 
4MA.2.21	For at the time when God created man, He implanted within him his passions and moral nature. 
4MA.2.22	And at that time He enthroned above all the holy leader mind, through the medium of the senses. 
4MA.2.23	And He gave a law to this mind, by living according to which it will maintain a temperate, and just, and good, and manly reign. 
4MA.2.24	How, then, a man may say, if reasoning be master of the passions, has it no control over forgetfulness and ignorance?
4MA.3.1	The argument is exceedingly ridiculous: for reasoning does not appear to bear sway over its own affections, but over those of the body, 
4MA.3.2	in such a way as that any one of you may not be able to root out desire, but reasoning will enable you to avoid being enslaved to it. 
4MA.3.3	One may not be able to root out anger from the soul, but it is possible to withstand anger. 
4MA.3.4	Any one of you may not be able to eradicate malice, but reasoning has force to work with you to prevent you yielding to malice. 
4MA.3.5	For reasoning is not an eradicator, but an antagonist of the passions. 
4MA.3.6	And this may be more clearly comprehended from the thirst of king David. 
4MA.3.7	For after David had been attacking the Philistines the whole day, he with the soldiers of his nation killed many of them; 
4MA.3.8	then when evening came, sweating and very weary, he came to the royal tent, about which the entire army of our ancestors was encamped. 
4MA.3.9	Now all the rest of them were at supper; 
4MA.3.10	but the king, being very much thirsty, although he had numerous springs, could not by their means quench his thirst; 
4MA.3.11	but a certain irrational longing for the water in the enemy’s camp grew stronger and fiercer upon him, and consumed him with languish. 
4MA.3.12	Wherefore his bodyguards being troubled at this longing of the king, two valiant young soldiers, reverencing the desire of the king, put on their panoplies, and taking a pitcher, got over the ramparts of the enemies: 
4MA.3.13	and unperceived by the guardians of the gate, they went throughout the whole camp of the enemy in quest. 
4MA.3.14	And having boldly discovered the fountain, they filled out of it the draught for the king. 
4MA.3.15	But he, though parched with thirst, reasoned that a draught reputed of equal value to blood, would be terribly dangerous to his soul. 
4MA.3.16	Wherefore, setting up reasoning in opposition to his desire, he poured out the draught to God. 
4MA.3.17	For the temperate mind has power to conquer the pressure of the passions, and to quench the fires of excitement, 
4MA.3.18	and to wrestle down the pains of the body, however excessive; and, through the excellency of reasoning, to abominate all the assaults of the passions. 
4MA.3.19	But the occasion now invites us to give an illustration of temperate reasoning from history. 
4MA.3.20	For at a time when our fathers were in possession of undisturbed peace through obedience to the law, and were prosperous, so that Seleucus Nicanor, the king of Asia, both assigned them money for divine service, and accepted their form of government, 
4MA.3.21	then certain persons, bringing in new things contrary to the general unanimity, in various ways fell into calamities.
4MA.4.1	For a certain man named Simon, who was in opposition to Onias, who once held the high priesthood for life, and was an honourable and good man, after slandering him in every way, he could not injure him with the people, went away as an exile, with the intention of betraying his country. 
4MA.4.2	Whence coming to Apollonius, the military governor of Syria, and Phoenicia, and Cilicia, he said, 
4MA.4.3	Having good will to the king’s affairs, I am come to inform you that infinite private wealth is laid up in the treasuries of Jerusalem which do not belong to the temple, but pertain to king Seleucus. 
4MA.4.4	Apollonius, acquainting himself with the particulars of this, praised Simon for his care of the king’s interests, and going up to Seleucus informed him of the treasure; 
4MA.4.5	and getting authority about it, and quickly advancing into our country with the accursed Simon and a very heavy force, 
4MA.4.6	he said that he came with the commands of the king that he should take the private money of the treasure. 
4MA.4.7	And the nation, indignant at this proclamation, and replying to the effect that it was extremely unfair that those who had committed deposits to the sacred treasury should be deprived of them, resisted as well as they could. 
4MA.4.8	But Appolonius went away with threats into the temple. 
4MA.4.9	And the priests, with the women and children, having supplicated God to throw his shield over the holy, despised place, 
4MA.4.10	and Appolonius going up with his armed force to the seizure of the treasure, —there appeared from heaven angels riding on horseback, all radiant in armour, filling them with much fear and trembling. 
4MA.4.11	And Apollonius fell half dead upon the court which is open to all nations, and extended his hands to heaven, and implored the Hebrews, with tears, to pray for him, and propitiate the heavenly army. 
4MA.4.12	For he said that he had sinned, so as to be consequently worthy of death; and that if he were saved, he would celebrate to all men the blessedness of the holy place. 
4MA.4.13	Onias the high priest, induced by these words, although for other reasons anxious that king Seleucus should not suppose that Apollonius was slain by human device and not by Divine punishment, prayed for him; 
4MA.4.14	and he being thus unexpectedly saved, departed to manifest to the king what had happened to him. 
4MA.4.15	But on the death of Seleucus the king, his son Antiochus Epiphanes succeeds to the kingdom: a man of arrogant pride and terrible. 
4MA.4.16	Who having deposed Onias from the high priesthood, appointed his brother Jason to be high priest: 
4MA.4.17	who had made a covenant, if he would give him this authority, to pay yearly three thousand and six hundred and sixty talents. 
4MA.4.18	And he committed to him the high priesthood and rulership over the nation. 
4MA.4.19	And he both changed the manner of living of the people, and perverted their civil customs into all lawlessness. 
4MA.4.20	So that he not only erected a gymnasium on the very citadel of our country, 
4MA.4.21	At which Divine vengeance being grieved, instigated Antiochus himself against them. 
4MA.4.22	For being at war with Ptolemy in Egypt, he heard that on a report of his death being spread abroad, the inhabitants of Jerusalem had exceedingly rejoiced, and he quickly marched against them. 
4MA.4.23	And having subdued them, he established a decree that if any of them lived according to the laws of his country he should die. 
4MA.4.24	And when he could by no means destroy by his decrees the obedience to the law of the nation, but saw all his threats and punishments without effect, 
4MA.4.25	for even women, because they continued to circumcise their children, were flung down a precipice along with them, knowing beforehand of the punishment. 
4MA.4.26	When, therefore, his decrees were disregarded by the people, he himself compelled by means of tortures every one of this race, by tasting forbidden meats, to renounce the Jewish religion.
4MA.5.1	The tyrant Antiochus, therefore, sitting in public state with his assessors upon a certain lofty place, with his armed troops standing in a circle around him, 
4MA.5.2	commanded his spearbearers to seize every one of the Hebrews, and to compel them to taste swine’s flesh, and things offered to idols. 
4MA.5.3	And should any of them be unwilling to eat the accursed food, they were to be tortured on the wheel, and so killed. 
4MA.5.4	And when many had been seized, a foremost man of the assembly, a Hebrew, by name Eleazar, a priest by family, by profession a lawyer, and advanced in years, and for this reason known to many of the king’s followers, was brought near to him. 
4MA.5.5	And Antiochus seeing him, said, 
4MA.5.6	I would counsel you, old man, before your tortures begin, to taste the swine’s flesh, and save your life; for I feel respect for your age and hoary head, which since you have had so long, you appear to me to be no philosopher in retaining the superstition of the Jews. 
4MA.5.7	For wherefore, since nature has conferred upon you the most excellent flesh of this animal, do you loathe it? 
4MA.5.8	It seems senseless not to enjoy what is pleasant, yet not disgraceful; and from notions of sinfulness, to reject the boons of nature. 
4MA.5.9	And you will be acting, I think, still more senselessly, if you follow vain conceits about the truth. 
4MA.5.10	And you will, moreover, be despising me to your own punishment. 
4MA.5.11	Will you not awake from your trifling philosophy? and give up the folly of your notions; and, regaining understanding worthy of your age, search into the truth of an expedient course? 
4MA.5.12	and, reverencing my kindly admonition, have pity upon your own years? 
4MA.5.13	For, bear in mind, that if there be any power which watches over this religion of yours, it will pardon you for all transgressions of the law which you commit through compulsion. 
4MA.5.14	While the tyrant incited him in this manner to the unlawful eating of flesh, Eleazar begged permission to speak. 
4MA.5.15	And having received power to speak, he began deliver himself like this: 
4MA.5.16	We, O Antiochus, who are persuaded that we live under a divine law, consider no compulsion to be so forcible as obedience to that law; 
4MA.5.17	wherefore we consider that we ought not in any point to transgress the law. 
4MA.5.18	And indeed, were our law (as you suppose) not truly divine, and if we wrongly think it divine, we should have no right even in that case to destroy our sense of religion. 
4MA.5.19	think not eating the unclean, then, a trifling offence. 
4MA.5.20	For transgression of the law, whether in small or great matters, is of equal moment; 
4MA.5.21	for in either case the law is equally slighted. 
4MA.5.22	But you deride our philosophy, as though we lived irrationally in it. 
4MA.5.23	Yet it instructs us in temperance, so that we are superior to all pleasures and lusts; and it exercises us in manliness, so that we cheerfully undergo every grievance. 
4MA.5.24	And it instructs us in justice, so that in all our dealings we render what is due; and it teaches us piety, so that we worship the one only God becomingly. 
4MA.5.25	Wherefore it is that we eat not the unclean; for believing that the law was established by God, we are convinced that the Creator of the world, in giving his laws, sympathises with our nature. 
4MA.5.26	Those things which are convenient to our souls, he has directed us to eat; but those which are repugnant to them, he has interdicted. 
4MA.5.27	But, tyrant-like, you not only force us to break the law, but also to eat, that you may ridicule us as we thus profanely eat: 
4MA.5.28	but you shall not have this cause of laughter against me; 
4MA.5.29	nor will I transgress the sacred oaths of my forefathers to keep the law. 
4MA.5.30	No, not if you pluck out my eyes, and consume my entrails. 
4MA.5.31	I am not so old, and void of manliness, but that my rational powers are youthful in defence of my religion. 
4MA.5.32	Now then; prepare your wheels, and kindle a fiercer flame. 
4MA.5.33	I will not so compassionate my old age, as on my account to break the law of my country. 
4MA.5.34	I will not belie you, O law, my instructor! or forsake you, O beloved self-control! 
4MA.5.35	I will not put you to shame, O philosopher Reason; or deny you, O honoured priesthood, and science of the law. 
4MA.5.36	Mouth! you shall not pollute my old age, nor the full stature of a perfect life. 
4MA.5.37	My fathers shall receive me pure, not having quailed before your compulsion, though to death. 
4MA.5.38	For over the ungodly you shall tyrannize; but you shall not lord it over my thoughts about religion, either by your arguments, or through deeds.
4MA.6.1	When Eleazar had in this manner answered the exhortations of the tyrant, the spearbearers came up, and rudely haled Eleazar to the instruments of torture. 
4MA.6.2	And first, they stripped the old man, adorned as he was with the beauty of piety. 
4MA.6.3	Then tying back his arms and hands, they disdainfully used him with stripes; 
4MA.6.4	a herald opposite crying out, Obey the commands of the king. 
4MA.6.5	But Eleazar, the high-minded and truly noble, as one tortured in a dream, regarded it not all. 
4MA.6.6	But raising his eyes on high to heaven, the old man’s flesh was stripped off by the scourges, and his blood streamed down, and his sides were pierced through. 
4MA.6.7	And falling upon the ground, from his body having no power to support the pains, he yet kept his reasoning upright and unbending. 
4MA.6.8	then one of the harsh spearbearers leapt upon his belly as he was falling, to force him upright. 
4MA.6.9	But he endured the pains, and despised the cruelty, and persevered through the indignities; 
4MA.6.10	and like a noble athlete, the old man, when struck, vanquished his torturers. 
4MA.6.11	His countenance sweating, and he panting for breath, he was admired by the very torturers for his courage. 
4MA.6.12	Wherefore, partly in pity for his old age, 
4MA.6.13	partly from the sympathy of acquaintance, and partly in admiration of his endurance, some of the attendants of the king said, 
4MA.6.14	Why do you unreasonably destroy yourself, O Eleazar, with these miseries? 
4MA.6.15	We will bring you some meat cooked by yourself, and do you save yourself by pretending that you have eaten swine’s flesh. 
4MA.6.16	And Eleazar, as though the advice more painfully tortured him, cried out, 
4MA.6.17	Let not us who are children of Abraham be so evil advised as by giving way to make use of an unbecoming pretence; 
4MA.6.18	for it were irrational, if having lived up to old age in all truth, and having scrupulously guarded our character for it, we should now turn back, 
4MA.6.19	and ourselves should become a pattern of impiety to the young, as being an example of pollution eating. 
4MA.6.20	It would be disgraceful if we should live on some short time, and that scorned by all men for cowardice, 
4MA.6.21	and be condemned by the tyrant for unmanliness, by not contending to the death for our divine law. 
4MA.6.22	Wherefore do you, O children of Abraham, die nobly for your religion. 
4MA.6.23	You° spearbearers of the tyrant, why do you° linger? 
4MA.6.24	Beholding him so high-minded against misery, and not changing at their pity, they led him to the fire: 
4MA.6.25	then with their wickedly contrived instruments they burnt him on the fire, and poured stinking fluids down into his nostrils. 
4MA.6.26	And he being at length burnt down to the bones, and about to expire, raised his eyes Godward, and said, 
4MA.6.27	You know, O God, that when I might have been saved, I am slain for the sake of the law by tortures of fire. 
4MA.6.28	Be merciful to your people, and be satisfied with the punishment of me on their account. 
4MA.6.29	Let my blood be a purification for them, and take my life in recompense for theirs. 
4MA.6.30	Thus speaking, the holy man departed, noble in his torments, and even to the agonies of death resisted in his reasoning for the sake of the law. 
4MA.6.31	Confessedly, therefore, religious reasoning is master of the passions. 
4MA.6.32	For had the passions been superior to reasoning, I would have given them the witness of this mastery. 
4MA.6.33	But now, since reasoning conquered the passions, we befittingly awared it the authority of first place. 
4MA.6.34	And it is but fair that we should allow, that the power belongs to reasoning, since it masters external miseries. 
4MA.6.35	Ridiculous would it be were it not so; and I prove that reasoning has not only mastered pains, but that it is also superior to the pleasures, and withstands them.
4MA.7.1	The reasoning of our father Eleazar, like a first-rate pilot, steering the vessel of piety in the sea of passions, 
4MA.7.2	and flouted by the threats of the tyrant, and overwhelmed with the breakers of torture, 
4MA.7.3	in no way shifted the rudder of piety till it sailed into the harbour of victory over death. 
4MA.7.4	Not so has ever a city, when besieged, held out against many and various machines, as did that holy man, when his pious soul was tried with the fiery trial of tortures and rackings, move his besiegers through the religious reasoning that shielded him. 
4MA.7.5	For father Eleazar, projecting his disposition, broke the raging waves of the passions as with a jutting promontory. 
4MA.7.6	O priest worthy of the priesthood! you didn’t pollute your sacred teeth; nor make your appetite, which had always embraced the clean and lawful, a partaker of profanity. 
4MA.7.7	O harmonizer with the law, and sage devoted to a divine life! 
4MA.7.8	Of such a character ought those to be who perform the duties of the law at the risk of their own blood, and defend it with generous sweat by sufferings even to death. 
4MA.7.9	You, father, have gloriously established our right government by your endurance; and making of much account our service past, prevented its destruction, and, by your deeds, have made credible the words of philosophy. 
4MA.7.10	O aged man of more power than tortures, elder more vigourous than fire, greatest king over the passions, Eleazar! 
4MA.7.11	For as father Aaron, armed with a censer, hastening through the consuming fire, vanquished the flame-bearing angel, 
4MA.7.12	so, Eleazar, the descendant of Aaron, wasted away by the fire, didn’t give up his reasoning. 
4MA.7.13	And, what is most wonderful, though an old man, though the labours of his body were now spent, and his muscles were relaxed, and his sinews worn out, he recovered youth. 
4MA.7.14	By the spirit of reasoning, and the reasoning of Isaac, he rendered powerless the many-headed instrument. 
4MA.7.15	O blessed old age, and reverend hoar head, and life obedient to the law, which the faithful seal of death perfected. 
4MA.7.16	If, then, an old man, through religion, despised tortures even to death, confessedly religious reasoning is ruler of the passions. 
4MA.7.17	But perhaps some might say, It is not all who conquer passions, as all do not possess wise reasoning. 
4MA.7.18	But they who have meditated upon religion with their whole heart, these alone can master the passions of the flesh; 
4MA.7.19	they who believe that to God they die not; for, as our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, they live to God. 
4MA.7.20	This circumstance, then, is by no means an objection, that some who have weak reasoning, are governed by their passions: 
4MA.7.21	since what person, walking religiously by the whole rule of philosophy, and believing in God, 
4MA.7.22	and knowing that it is a blessed thing to endure all kinds of hardships for virtue, would not, for the sake of religion, master his passion? 
4MA.7.23	For the wise and brave man only is lord over his passions. 
4MA.7.24	Whence it is, that even boys, trained with the philosophy of religious reasoning, have conquered still more bitter tortures: 
4MA.7.25	for when the tyrant was manifestly vanquished in his first attempt, in being unable to force the old man to eat the unclean thing,—
4MA.8.1	Then, indeed, vehemently swayed with passion, he commanded to bring others of the adult Hebrews, and if they would eat of the unclean thing, to let them go when they had eaten; but if they objected, to torment them more grievously. 
4MA.8.2	The tyrant having given this charge, seven kindred were brought into his presence, along with their aged mother, handsome, and modest, and well-born, and altogether comely. 
4MA.8.3	When the tyrant saw them encircling their mother as in a dance, he was pleased at them; and being struck with their becoming and innocent manner, smiled upon them, and calling them near, said: 
4MA.8.4	O youths, with favourable feelings, I admire the beauty of each of you; and greatly honouring so numerous a band of kindred, I not only counsel you not to share the madness of the old man who has been tortured before, 
4MA.8.5	but I do beg you to yield, and to enjoy my friendship; for I possess the power, not only of punishing those who disobey my commands, but of doing good to those who obey them. 
4MA.8.6	Put confidence in me, then, and you shall receive places of authority in my government, if you forsake your national ordinance, 
4MA.8.7	and, conforming to the Greek mode of life, alter your rule, and revel in youth’s delights. 
4MA.8.8	For if you provoke me by your disobedience, you will compel me to destroy you, every one, with terrible punishments by tortures. 
4MA.8.9	Have mercy, then, upon your own selves, whom I, although an enemy, compassionate for your age and attractive appearance. 
4MA.8.10	Will you not reason upon this—that if you disobey, there will be nothing left for you but to die in tortures? 
4MA.8.11	Thus speaking, he ordered the instruments of torture to be brought forward, that very fear might prevail upon them to eat unclean meat. 
4MA.8.12	And when the spearman brought forward the wheels, and the racks, and the hooks, and catapults, and cauldrons, pans, and finger-racks, and iron hands and wedges, and bellows, the tyrant continue: 
4MA.8.13	Fear, young men, and the righteousness which you° worship will be merciful to you if you err from compulsion. 
4MA.8.14	Now they having listened to these words of persuasion, and seeing the fearful instruments, not only were not afraid, but even answered the arguments of the tyrant, and through their good reasoning destroyed his power. 
4MA.8.15	Now let’s consider the matter: had any of them been weak-spirited and cowardly amongst them, what reasoning would they have employed but these? 
4MA.8.16	O wretched that we are, and exceedingly senseless! when the king exhorts us, and calls us to his bounty, should we not obey him? 
4MA.8.17	Why do we cheer ourselves with vain counsels, and venture upon a disobedience bringing death? 
4MA.8.18	Shall we not fear, O kindred, the instruments of torture and weigh the threatenings of torment and shun this vain-glory and destructive pride? 
4MA.8.19	Let’s have compassion upon our age and relent over the years of our mother. 
4MA.8.20	And let’s bear in mind that we shall be dying as rebels. 
4MA.8.21	And Divine Justice will pardon us if we fear the king through necessity. 
4MA.8.22	Why withdraw ourselves from a most sweet life, and deprive ourselves of this pleasant world? 
4MA.8.23	Let’s not oppose necessity, nor seek vain-glory by our own excruciation. 
4MA.8.24	The law itself is not forward to put us to death, if we dread torture. 
4MA.8.25	Whence has such angry zeal taken root in us, and such fatal obstinacy approved itself to us, when we might live unmolested by the king? 
4MA.8.26	But nothing of this kind did the young men say or think when about to be tortured. 
4MA.8.27	For they were well aware of the sufferings, and masters of the pains. 
4MA.8.28+4MA.8.29	So that as soon as the tyrant had ceased counselling them to eat the unclean, they altogether with one voice, as from the same heart said:
4MA.9.1	Why delay you, O tyrant? for we are more ready to die than to transgress the injunctions of our fathers. 
4MA.9.2	And we should be disgracing our fathers if we didn’t obey the law, and take knowledge for our guide. 
4MA.9.3	O tyrant, counsellor of law-breaking, do not, hating us as you do, pity us more than we pity ourselves. 
4MA.9.4	For we account escape to be worse than death. 
4MA.9.5	And you think to scare us, by threatening us with death by tortures, as though you had learnt nothing by the death of Eleazar. 
4MA.9.6	But if aged men of the Hebrews have died in the cause of religion after enduring torture, more rightly should we younger men die, scorning your cruel tortures, which our aged instructor overcame. 
4MA.9.7	Make the attempt, then, O tyrant; and if you put us to death for our religion, think not that you harm us by torturing us. 
4MA.9.8	For we through this ill-treatment and endurance shall bear off the rewards of virtue. 
4MA.9.9	But you, for the wicked and despotic slaughter of us, shall, from the Divine vengeance, endure eternal torture by fire. 
4MA.9.10	When they had thus spoken, the tyrant was not only exasperated against them as being refractory, but enraged with them as being ungrateful. 
4MA.9.11	So that, at his bidding, the torturers brought forth the oldest of them, and tearing through his tunic, bound his hands and arms on each side with thongs. 
4MA.9.12	And when they had laboured hard without effect in scourging him, they hurled him upon the wheel. 
4MA.9.13	And the noble youth, extended upon this, became dislocated. 
4MA.9.14	And with every member disjointed, he exclaimed in expostulation, 
4MA.9.15	O most accursed tyrant, and enemy of heavenly justice, and cruel-hearted, I am no murderer, nor sacrilegious man, whom you thus ill-usest; but a defender of the Divine law. 
4MA.9.16	And when the spearmen said, Consent to eat, that you may be released from your tortures,— 
4MA.9.17	he answered, Not so powerful, O accursed ministers, is your wheel, as to stifle my reasoning; cut my limbs, and burn my flesh, and twist my joints. 
4MA.9.18	For through all my torments I will convince you that the children of the Hebrews are alone unconquered in behalf of virtue. 
4MA.9.19	While he was saying this, they heaped up fuel, and setting fire to it, strained him upon the wheel still more. 
4MA.9.20	And the wheel was defiled all over with blood, and the hot ashes were quenched by the droppings of gore, and pieces of flesh were scattered about the axles of the machine. 
4MA.9.21	And although the framework of his bones was now destroyed the high-minded and Abrahamic youth didn’t groan. 
4MA.9.22	But, as though transformed by fire into immortality, he nobly endured the rackings, saying 
4MA.9.23	Imitate me, O kindred, nor ever desert your station, nor renounce my brotherhood in courage: fight the holy and honourable fight of religion; 
4MA.9.24	by which means our just and paternal Providence, becoming merciful to the nation, will punish the pestilent tyrant. 
4MA.9.25	And saying this, the revered youth abruptly closed his life. 
4MA.9.26	And when all admired his courageous soul, the spearmen brought forward him who was second in point of age, and having put on iron hands, bound him with pointed hooks to the catapelt. 
4MA.9.27	And when, on enquiring whether he would eat before he was tortured, they heard his noble sentiment, 
4MA.9.28	after they with the iron hands had violently dragged all the flesh from the neck to the chin, the panther-like beasts tore off the very skin of his head: but he, bearing with firmness this misery, said, 
4MA.9.29	How sweet is every form of death for the religion of our fathers! and he said to the tyrant, 
4MA.9.30	Thinkest you not, most cruel of all tyrants, that you are now tortured more than I, finding your overweening conception of tyranny conquered by our perseverance in behalf of our religion? 
4MA.9.31	For I lighten my suffering by the pleasures which are connected with virtue. 
4MA.9.32	But you are tortured with threatenings for impiety; and you shall not escape, most corrupt tyrant, the vengeance of Divine wrath.
4MA.10.1	Now this one, having endured this praiseworthy death, the third was brought along, and exhorted by many to taste and save his life. 
4MA.10.2	But he cried out and said, Know you° not, that the father of those who are dead, became the father of me also; and that the same mother bare me; and that I was brought up in the same tenets? 
4MA.10.3	I renounce not the noble relationship of my kindred. 
4MA.10.4	Now then, whatever instrument of vengeance you° have, apply it to my body, for you° are not able to touch, even if you° wish it, my soul. 
4MA.10.5	But they, highly incensed at his boldness of speech, dislocated his hands and feet with racking engines, and wrenching them from their sockets, dismembered him. 
4MA.10.6	And they dragged round his fingers, and his arms, and his legs, and his ankles. 
4MA.10.7	And not being able by any means to strangle him, they tore off his skin, together with the extreme tips of his fingers and then dragged him to the wheel; 
4MA.10.8	around which his vertebral joints were loosened, and he saw his own flesh torn to shreds, and streams of blood flowing from his entrails. 
4MA.10.9	And when about to die, he said, 
4MA.10.10	We, O accursed tyrant, suffer this for the sake of Divine education and virtue. 
4MA.10.11	But you, for your impiety and blood shedding, shall endure indissoluble torments. 
4MA.10.12	And thus having died worthily of his kindred, they dragged forward the fourth, saying, 
4MA.10.13	Do not you share the madness of your kindred: but give regard to the king, and save yourself. 
4MA.10.14	But he said to them, You have not a fire so scorching as to make me play the coward. 
4MA.10.15	By the blessed death of my kindred, and the eternal punishment of the tyrant, and the glorious life of the pious, I will not repudiate the noble brotherhood. 
4MA.10.16	Invent, O tyrant, tortures; that you may learn, even through them, that I am the brother of those tormented before. 
4MA.10.17	When he had said this, the blood-thirsty, and murderous, and unhallowed Antiochus ordered his tongue to be cut out. 
4MA.10.18	But he said, Even if you take away the organ of speech, yet God hears the silent. 
4MA.10.19	Behold, my tongue is extended, cut it off; for not for that halt you extirpate our reasoning. 
4MA.10.20	Gladly do we lose our limbs in behalf of God. 
4MA.10.21	But God shall speedily find you, since you cut off the tongue, the instrument of divine melody.
4MA.11.1	And when he had died, disfigured in his torments, the fifth leapt forward, and said, 
4MA.11.2	I intend not, O tyrant, to get excused from the torment which is in behalf of virtue. 
4MA.11.3	But I have come of my own accord, that by the death of me, you may owe heavenly vengeance a punishment for more crimes. 
4MA.11.4	O you hater of virtue and of men, what have we done that you thus revel in our blood? 
4MA.11.5	Does it seem evil to you that we worship the Founder of all things, and live according to his surpassing law? 
4MA.11.6	But this is worthy of honours, not torments; 
4MA.11.7	had you been capable of the higher feelings of men, and possessed the hope of salvation from God. 
4MA.11.8	Behold now, being alien from God, you make war against those who are religious towards God. 
4MA.11.9	As he said this, the spearbearers bound him, and drew him to the catapelt: 
4MA.11.10	to which binding him at his knees, and fastening them with iron fetters, they bent down his loins upon the wedge of the wheel; and his body was then dismembered, scorpion-fashion. 
4MA.11.11	With his breath thus confined, and his body strangled, he said, 
4MA.11.12	A great favour you bestow upon us, O tyrant, by enabling us to manifest our adherence to the law by means of nobler sufferings. 
4MA.11.13	He also being dead, the sixth, quite a youth, was brought out; and on the tyrant asking him whether he would eat and be delivered, he said, 
4MA.11.14	I am indeed younger than my brothers, but in understanding I am as old; 
4MA.11.15	for having been born and reared to the same end, we are bound to die also in behalf of the same cause. 
4MA.11.16	So that if you° think proper to torment us for not eating the unclean, then torment! 
4MA.11.17	As he said this, they brought him to the wheel. 
4MA.11.18	Extended upon which, with limbs racked and dislocated, he was gradually roasted from beneath. 
4MA.11.19	And having heated sharp spits, they approached them to his back; and having transfixed his sides, they burnt away his entrails. 
4MA.11.20	And he, while tormented, said, O period good and holy, in which, for the sake of religion, we kindred have been called to the contest of pain, and have not been conquered. 
4MA.11.21	For religious understanding, O tyrant, is unconquered. 
4MA.11.22	Armed with upright virtue, I also shall depart with my kindred. 
4MA.11.23	I, too, bearing with me a great avenger, O inventor of tortures, and enemy of the truly pious. 
4MA.11.24	We six youths have destroyed your tyranny. 
4MA.11.25	For is not your inability to overrule our reasoning, and to compel us to eat the unclean, your destruction? 
4MA.11.26	Your fire is cold to us, your catapelts are painless, and your violence harmless. 
4MA.11.27	For the guards not of a tyrant but of a divine law are our defenders: through this we keep our reasoning unconquered.
4MA.12.1	When he, too, had undergone blessed martyrdom, and died in the cauldron into which he had been thrown, the seventh, the youngest of all, came forward: 
4MA.12.2	whom the tyrant pitying, though he had been dreadfully reproached by his kindred, 
4MA.12.3	seeing him already encompassed with chains, had him brought nearer, and endeavored to counsel him, saying, 
4MA.12.4	You see the end of the madness of your kindred: for they have died in torture through disobedience; and you, if disobedient, having been miserably tormented, will yourself perish prematurely. 
4MA.12.5	But if you obey, you shall be my friend, and have a charge over the affairs of the kingdom. 
4MA.12.6	And having thus exhorted him, he sent for the mother of the boy; that, by condoling with her for the loss of so many sons, he might incline her, through the hope of safety, to render the survivor obedient. 
4MA.12.7	And he, after his mother had urged him on in the Hebrew tongue, (as we shall soon relate) says, 
4MA.12.8	Release me that I may speak to the king and all his friends. 
4MA.12.9	And they, rejoicing exceedingly at the promise of the youth, quickly let him go. 
4MA.12.10	And he, running up to the pans, said, 
4MA.12.11	Impious tyrant, and most blasphemous man, were you not ashamed, having received prosperity and a kingdom from God, to kill His servants, and to rack the doers of godliness? 
4MA.12.12	Wherefore the divine vengeance is reserving you for eternal fire and torments, which shall cling to you for all time. 
4MA.12.13	Were you not ashamed, man as you are, yet most savage, to cut out the tongues of men of like feeling and origin, and having thus abused to torture them? 
4MA.12.14	But they, bravely dying, fulfilled their religion towards God. 
4MA.12.15	But you shall groan according to your deserts for having slain without cause the champions of virtue. 
4MA.12.16	Wherefore, he continued, I myself, being about to die, 
4MA.12.17	will not forsake my kindred. 
4MA.12.18	And I call upon the God of my fathers to be merciful to my race. 
4MA.12.19	But you, both living and dead, he will punish. 
4MA.12.20	Thus having prayed, he hurled himself into the pans; and so expired.
4MA.13.1	If then, the seven kindred despised troubles even to death, it is confessed on all sides that righteous reasoning is absolute master over the passions. 
4MA.13.2	For just as if, had they as slaves to the passions, eaten of the unholy, we should have said that they had been conquered by the; 
4MA.13.3	now it is not so: but by means of the reasoning which is praised by God, they mastered their passions. 
4MA.13.4	And it is impossible to overlook the leadership of reflection: for it gained the victory over both passions and troubles. 
4MA.13.5	How, then, can we avoid according to these men mastery of passion through right reasoning, since they drew not back from the pains of fire? 
4MA.13.6	For just as by means of towers projecting in front of harbours men break the threatening waves, and thus assure a still course to vessels entering port, 
4MA.13.7	so that seven-towered right-reasoning of the young men, securing the harbour of religion, conquered the intermperance of passions. 
4MA.13.8	For having arranged a holy choir of piety, they encouraged one another, saying, 
4MA.13.9	Brothers, may we die brotherly for the law. Let us imitate the three young men in Assyria who despised the equally afflicting furnace. 
4MA.13.10	Let’s not be cowards in the manifestation of piety. 
4MA.13.11	And one said, Courage, brother; and another, Nobly endure. 
4MA.13.12	And another, Remember of what stock you° are; and by the hand of our father Isaac endured to be slain for the sake of piety. 
4MA.13.13	And one and all, looking on each other serene and confident, said, Let us sacrifice with all our heart our souls to God who gave them, and employ our bodies for the keeping of the law. 
4MA.13.14	Let’s not fear him who thinks he kills; 
4MA.13.15	for great is the trial of soul and danger of eternal torment laid up for those who transgress the commandment of God. 
4MA.13.16	Let’s arm ourselves, therefore, in the self-control, which is divine reasoning. 
4MA.13.17	If we suffer thus, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob will receive us, and all the fathers will commend us. 
4MA.13.18	And as each one of the kindred was haled away, the rest exclaimed, Disgrace us not, O brother, nor falsify those who died before you. 
4MA.13.19	Now you are not ignorant of the charm of brotherhood, which the Divine and all wise Providence has imparted through fathers to children, and has engendered through the mother’s womb. 
4MA.13.20	In which these brothers having remained an equal time, and having been formed for the same period, and been increased by the same blood, and having been perfected through the same principle of life, 
4MA.13.21	and having been brought forth at equal intervals, and having sucked milk from the same springs, hence their brotherly souls are reared up lovingly together; 
4MA.13.22	and increase the more powerfully by reason of this simultaneous rearing, and by daily intercourse, and by other education, and exercise in the law of God. 
4MA.13.23	Brotherly love being thus sympathetically constituted, the seven kindred had a more sympathetic mutual harmony. 
4MA.13.24	For being educated in the same law, and practising the same virtues, and reared up in a just course of life, they increased this harmony with each other. 
4MA.13.25	For a like ardour for what is right and honourable increased their fellow-feeling towards each other. 
4MA.13.26	For it acting along with religion, made their brotherly feeling more desirable to them. 
4MA.13.27	And yet, although nature and intercourse and virtuous morals increased their brotherly love those who were left endured to behold their kindred, who were ill-used for their religion, tortured even to death.
4MA.14.1	And more that this, they even urged them on to this ill-treatment; so that they not only despised pains themselves, but they even got the better of their affections of brotherly love. 
4MA.14.2	O reasoning more royal than a king, and freer than freemen! 
4MA.14.3	Sacred and harmonious concert of the seven kindred as concerning piety! 
4MA.14.4	None of the seven youths turned cowardly, or shrank back from death. 
4MA.14.5	But all of them, as though running the road to immortality, hastened on to death through tortures. 
4MA.14.6	For just as hands and feet are moved sympathetically with the directions of the soul, so those holy youths agreed to death for religion’s sake, as through the immortal soul of religion. 
4MA.14.7	O holy seven of harmonious kindred! for as the seven days of creation, about religion, 
4MA.14.8	so the youths, circling around the number seven, annulled the fear of torments. 
4MA.14.9	We now shudder at the recital of the affliction of those young men; but they not only saw, and not only heard the immediate execution of the threat, but undergoing it, persevered; and that through the pains of fire. 
4MA.14.10	And what could be more painful? for the power of fire, being sharp and quick, speedily dissolved their bodies. 
4MA.14.11	And think it not wonderful that reasoning bore rule over those men in their torments, when even a woman’s mind despised more manifold pains. 
4MA.14.12	For the mother of those seven youths endured the rackings of each of her children. 
4MA.14.13	And consider how comprehensive is the love of offspring, which draws every one to sympathy of affection, 
4MA.14.14	where irrational animals possess a similar sympathy and love for their offspring with men. 
4MA.14.15	The tame birds frequenting the roofs of our houses, defend their fledglings. 
4MA.14.16	Others build their nests, and hatch their young, in the tops of mountains and in the precipices of valleys, and the holes and tops of trees, and keep off the intruder. 
4MA.14.17	And if not able to do this, they fly circling round them in agony of affection, calling out in their own note, and save their offspring in whatever manner they are able. 
4MA.14.18	But why should we point attention to the sympathy towards children shown by irrational animals? 
4MA.14.19	The very bees, at the season of honey-making, attack all who approach; and pierce with their sting, as with a sword, those who draw near their hive, and repel them even to death. 
4MA.14.20	But sympathy with her children didn’t turn away the mother of the young men, who had a spirit kindred with that of Abraham.
4MA.15.1	O reasoning of the sons, lord over the passions, and religion more desirable to a mother than progeny! 
4MA.15.2	The mother, when two things were set before here, religion and the safety of her seven sons for a time, on the conditional promise of a tyrant, 
4MA.15.3	rather elected the religion which according to God preserves to eternal life. 
4MA.15.4	O in what way can I describe ethically the affections of parents towards their children, the resemblance of soul and of form engrafted into the small type of a child in a wonderful manner, especially through the greater sympathy of mothers with the feelings of those born of them! 
4MA.15.5	for by how much mothers are by nature weak in disposition and prolific in offspring, by so much the fonder they are of children. 
4MA.15.6	And of all mothers the mother of the seven was the fondest of children, who in seven childbirths had deeply engendered love towards them; 
4MA.15.7	and through her many pains undergone in connection with each one, was compelled to feel sympathy with them; 
4MA.15.8	yet, through fear of God, she neglected the temporary salvation of her children. 
4MA.15.9	Not but that, on account of the excellent disposition to the law, her maternal affection towards them was increased. 
4MA.15.10	For they were both just and temperate, and manly, and high-minded, and fond of their kindred, and so fond of their mother that even to death they obeyed her by observing the law. 
4MA.15.11	And yet, though there were so many circumstances connected with love of children to draw on a mother to sympathy, in the case of none of them were the various tortures able to pervert her principle. 
4MA.15.12	But she inclined each one separately and all together to death for religion. 
4MA.15.13	O holy nature and parental feeling, and reward of bringing up children, and unconquerable maternal affection! 
4MA.15.14	At the racking and roasting of each one of them, the observant mother was prevented by religion from changing. 
4MA.15.15	She saw her children’s flesh dissolving around the fire; and their extremities quivering on the ground, and the flesh of their heads dropped forward down to their beards, like masks. 
4MA.15.16	O you mother, who was tried at this time with bitterer pangs than those of parturition! 
4MA.15.17	O you only woman who have brought forth perfect holiness! 
4MA.15.18	Your firstborn, expiring, turned you not; nor the second, looking miserable in his torments; nor the third, breathing out his soul. 
4MA.15.19	Nor when you did behold the eyes of each of them looking sternly upon their tortures, and their nostrils foreboding death, did you weep! 
4MA.15.20	When you did see children’s flesh heaped upon children’s flesh that had been torn off, heads decapitated upon heads, dead falling upon the dead, and a choir of children turned through torture into a burying ground, you lamented not. 
4MA.15.21	Not so do siren melodies, or songs of swans, attract the hearers to listening, O voices of children calling upon your mother in the midst of torments! 
4MA.15.22	With what and what manner of torments was the mother herself tortured, as her sons were undergoing the wheel and the fires! 
4MA.15.23	But religious reasoning, having strengthened her courage in the midst of sufferings, enabled her to forego, for the time, parental love. 
4MA.15.24	Although beholding the destruction of seven children, the noble mother, after one embrace, stripped off 
4MA.15.25	For just as in a council-room, beholding in her own soul vehement counsellors, nature and parentage and love of her children, and the racking of her children, 
4MA.15.26	she holding two votes, one for the death, the other for the preservation of her children, 
4MA.15.27	didn’t lean to that which would have saved her children for the safety of a brief space. 
4MA.15.28	But this daughter of Abraham remembered his holy fortitude. 
4MA.15.29	O holy mother of a nation avenger of the law, and defender of religion, and prime bearer in the battle of the affections! 
4MA.15.30	O you nobler in endurance than males, and more manly than men in perseverance! 
4MA.15.31	For as the ark of Noah, bearing the world in the world-filling flood, bore up against the waves, 
4MA.15.32	so you, the guardian of the law, when surrounded on every side by the flood of passions, and straitened by violent storms which were the torments of they children, did bear up nobly against the storms against religion.
4MA.16.1	If, then, even a woman, and that an aged one, and the mother of seven children, endured to see her children’s torments even to death, confessedly religious reasoning is master even of the passions. 
4MA.16.2	I have proved, then, that not only men have obtained the mastery of their passions, but also that a woman despised the greatest torments. 
4MA.16.3	And not so fierce were the lions round Daniel, nor the furnace of Misael burning with most vehement fires as that natural love of children burnt within her, when she saw her seven sons tortured. 
4MA.16.4	But with the reasoning of religion the mother quenched passions so great and powerful. 
4MA.16.5	For we must consider also this: that, had the woman been faint hearted, as being their other, she would have lamented over them; and perhaps might have spoken thus: 
4MA.16.6	Ah! wretched I, and many times miserable; who having born seven sons, have become the mother of none. 
4MA.16.7	O seven useless childbirths, and seven profitless periods of labour, and fruitless givings of suck, and miserable nursings at the breast. 
4MA.16.8	Vainly, for your sakes, O sons, have I endured many pangs, and the more difficult anxieties of rearing. 
4MA.16.9	Alas, of my children, some of you unmarried, and some who have married to no profit, I shall not see your children, nor be felicitated as a grandmother. 
4MA.16.10	Ah, that I who had many and fair children, should be a lone widow full of sorrows! 
4MA.16.11	Nor, should I die, shall I have a son to bury me. But with such a lament as this the holy and God-fearing mother bewailed none of them. 
4MA.16.12	Nor did she divert any of them from death, nor grieve for them as for the dead. 
4MA.16.13	But as one possessed with an adamantine mind, and as one bringing forth again her full number of sons to immortality, she rather with supplication exhorted them to death in behalf of religion. 
4MA.16.14	O woman, soldier of God for religion, you, aged and a female, have conquered through endurance even a tyrant; and though but weak, have been found more powerful in deeds and words. 
4MA.16.15	For when you were seized along with your children, you stood looking upon Eleazar in torments, and said to your sons in the Hebrew tongue, 
4MA.16.16	O sons, noble is the contest; to which you being called as a witness for the nation, strive zealously for the laws of your country. 
4MA.16.17	For it were disgraceful that this old man should endure pains for the sake of righteousness, and that you who are younger should be afraid of the tortures. 
4MA.16.18	Remember that through God you° obtained existence, and have enjoyed it. 
4MA.16.19	And on this second account you° ought to bear every affliction because of God. 
4MA.16.20	For whom also our father Abraham was forward to sacrifice Isaac our progenitor, and shuddered not at the sight of his own paternal hand descending down with the sword upon him. 
4MA.16.21	And the righteous Daniel was cast to the lions; and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael, were slung out into a furnace of fire; yet they endured through God. 
4MA.16.22	You, then, having the same faith towards God, be not troubled. 
4MA.16.23	For it is unreasonable that they who know religion should not stand up against troubles. 
4MA.16.24	With these arguments, the mother of seven, exhorting each of her sons, over-persuaded them from transgressing the commandment of God. 
4MA.16.25	And they saw this, too, that they who die for God, live to God; as Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the patriarchs.
4MA.17.1	And some of the spearbearers said, that when she herself was about to be seized for the purpose of being put to death, she threw herself upon the pile, rather than they should touch her person. 
4MA.17.2	O you mother, who together with seven children did destroy the violence of the tyrant, and render void his wicked intentions, and exhibit the nobleness of faith! 
4MA.17.3	For you, as a house bravely built upon the pillar of your children, did bear without swaying, the shock of tortures. 
4MA.17.4	Be of good cheer, therefore, O holy-minded mother! holding the firm 
4MA.17.5	Not so gracious does the moon appear with the stars in heaven, as you are established honourable before God, and fixed in the firmament with your sons who you did illuminate with religion to the stars. 
4MA.17.6	For your bearing of children was after the fashion of a child of Abraham. 
4MA.17.7	And, were it lawful for us to paint as on a tablet the religion of your story, the spectators would not shudder at beholding the mother of seven children enduring for the sake of religion various tortures even to death. 
4MA.17.8	And it had been a worth thing to have inscribed upon the tomb itself these words as a memorial to those of the nation, 
4MA.17.9	Here an aged priest, and an aged woman, and seven sons, are buried through the violence of a tyrant, who wished to destroy the society of the Hebrews. 
4MA.17.10	These also avenged their nation, looking to God, and enduring torments to death. 
4MA.17.11	For it was truly a divine contest which was carried through by them. 
4MA.17.12	For at that time virtue presided over the contest, approving the victory through endurance, namely, immortality, eternal life. 
4MA.17.13	Eleazar was the first to contend: and the mother of the seven children entered the contest; and the kindred contended. 
4MA.17.14	The tyrant was the opposite; and the world and living men were the spectators. 
4MA.17.15	And reverence for God conquered, and crowned her own athletes. 
4MA.17.16	Who didn’t admire those champions of true legislation? who were not astonied? 
4MA.17.17	The tyrant himself, and all their council, admired their endurance; 
4MA.17.18	through which, also, they now stand beside the divine throne, and live a blessed life. 
4MA.17.19	For Moses says, And all the saints are under your hands. 
4MA.17.20	These, therefore, having been sanctified through God, have been honoured not only with this honour, but that also by their means the enemy didn’t overcome our nation; 
4MA.17.21	and that the tyrant was punished, and their country purified. 
4MA.17.22	For they became the ransom to the sin of the nation; and the Divine Providence saved Israel, aforetime afflicted, by the blood of those pious ones, and the propitiatory death. 
4MA.17.23	For the tyrant Antiochus, looking to their manly virtue, and to their endurance in torture, proclaimed that endurance as an example to his soldiers. 
4MA.17.24	And they proved to be to him noble and brave for land battles and for sieges; and he conquered and stormed the towns of all his enemies.
4MA.18.1	O Israelitish children, descendants of the seed of Abraham, obey this law, and in every way be religious. 
4MA.18.2	Knowing that religious reasoning is lord of the passions, and those not only inward but outward. 
4MA.18.3	When those persons giving up their bodies to pains for the sake of religion, were not only admired by men, but were deemed worthy of a divine portion. 
4MA.18.4	And the nation through them obtained peace, and having renewed the observance of the law in their country, drove the enemy out of the land. 
4MA.18.5	And the tyrant Antiochus was both punished upon earth, and is punished now he is dead; for when he was quite unable to compel the Israelites to adopt foreign customs, and to desert the manner of life of their fathers, 
4MA.18.6	then, departing from Jerusalem, he made war against the Persians. 
4MA.18.7	And the righteous mother of the seven children spoke also as follows to her offspring: I was a pure virgin, and went not beyond my father’s house; but I took care of the built-up rib. 
4MA.18.8	No destroyer of the desert, 
4MA.18.9	And these my children, having arrived at maturity, their father died: blessed was he! for having sought out a life of fertility in children, he was not grieved with a period of loss of children. 
4MA.18.10	And he used to teach you, when yet with you, the law and the prophets. 
4MA.18.11	He used to read to you the slaying of Abel by Cain, and the offering up of Isaac, and the imprisonment of Joseph. 
4MA.18.12	And he used to tell you of the zealous Phinehas; and informed you of Ananias and Azarias, and Misael in the fire. 
4MA.18.13	And he used to glorify Daniel, who was in the den of lions, and pronounce him blessed. 
4MA.18.14	And he used to put you in mind of the scripture of Esaias, which says, Even if you pass through the fire, it shall not burn you. 
4MA.18.15	He chanted to you David, the hymn-writer, who says, Many are the afflictions of the just. 
4MA.18.16	He declared the proverbs of Solomon, who says, He is a tree of life to all those who do His will. 
4MA.18.17	He used to verify Ezekiel, who said, Shall these dry bones live? 
4MA.18.18	For he didn’t forget the song which Moses taught, proclaiming, I will kill, and I will make to live. 
4MA.18.19	This is our life, and the length of our days. 
4MA.18.20	O that bitter, and yet not bitter, day when the bitter tyrant of the Greeks, quenching fire with fire in his cruel cauldrons, brought with boiling rage the seven sons of the daughter of Abraham to the catapelt, and to all his torments! 
4MA.18.21	He pierced the balls of their eyes, and cut out their tongues, and put them to death with varied tortures. 
4MA.18.22	Wherefore divine retribution pursued and will pursue the pestilent wretch. 
4MA.18.23	But the children of Abraham, with their victorious mother, are assembled together to the choir of their father; having received pure and immortal souls from God. 
4MA.18.24	To whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
